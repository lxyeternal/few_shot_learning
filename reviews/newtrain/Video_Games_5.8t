Lord of the rings: The Two towers is an awesome game! With medioker graphics, and awesome levels, this game is a ton of non-stop fun. Fight creatures and see cutscenes from the movie. You can do specialty moves and combos, power up, and feel like you are realy fighting with the characters. For extreme fun and inneraction, buy this game, for its worth every penny.	1
This game is an amazing mix of the first two LOTR movies.  It plays from the middle of the original to the end of the second as a movie and constantly and semelesly changes into epic battles of large proportions.  This game would have gotten 5 stars if it had multiplayer options.  Oh well, there's always a sequel.  Just have to wait until next November I suppose.	1
Realy cool game good action seaquences includes 1st and 2nd movie parts Easy to control too short only like 15 levels good graphics	1
And the lightning effects aren't at as a high resolution, and aren't as realistic but are still very good. All other engine quality is equal. The game ran much slower than it did on XBOX, 10fps. 30 on XBOX. Well wat dya expect when your running it on a GeForce 2 series video card. The game requires 256 mb of ram, 800MHZ pentium 3 or equivelant, 32mb 3-D hardware T & L directx8.1 compatible video card dx8.1 etc a bit higher than unreal 2's system requirements. This game still looks beatiful on the PC, a geforce 3 is recommended, I suggest a powerful computer for this game. :)	1
I just can't put into words how awsome this game is; but I'll try.  There are so many moves, gadgets, details in every aspect...here goes: The gameplay: Incredible!  This game should easily win game of the year!  Why?  It's so realistic, so breathtaking, so nerve wracking at times that you really feel that you are Sam Fisher.  Here are the basic moves: You can crouch, roll (to move quickly through one area without being seen), jump, double jump (jump off a wall to cling on to a pipe at the top), split jump (where your up against the wall doing the splits.  You cant then jump down in surprise and knock out your enemy, or shoot him), cling to pipes (and move around, even hang from it while shooting down a guard).  Those are just a few!  You can knock people out, put a gun to their head and interrogate them.  Use people as human shields, hide against walls, knockout anybody, slide down a wire, etc...  So many moves, all so very cool, you'll really feel like a secret agent.  Now with these moves, you must make it through dozens of levels to prevent a war from happening.  If caught, the U.S. will have nothing to do with u.  You're on your own. Gadgets: Thankfully, with these awsome moves, you have perhaps the coolest gadgets ever thought up.  You have gadgets to unlock doors, look under the door, climb walls, shock people to death, etc...  So many cool gadgets!  You'll need every one of them to get through this war.  But that's not all!  You later on get cameras that you can shoot into a room to see everything before you enter, giving you time to plan, think, etc...  These cameras though (so cool) can also, when pressing the red B button, make a loud whistling sound that will attract guards.  When they are close, push the yellow Y button, and a sleeping gas will enter the air, knocking the guards unconscience, and leaving your path clear.  These cameras also have night vision, heat vision, and of course, regular vision.  So many uses, these cameras may save your life more than once.  Use them wisely. The game: In the game, you must get through different levels, finding out secrets in various ways, and doing whatever is asked of u.  U can read e-mails from hacked computers, listen in silently on conversations, hide dead or living bodies (you can either knock them out or put a bullet to their head).  Sam is also equipped with heat and night vision goggles.  So when you have been spotted, and several guards are coming your way, you can shoot out nearby lights, split jump and watch blind guards come in.  Put your night vision goggles on, jump down, put a gun to one's head, and use him as a human shield.  Shoot the others, knockout your hostage, hide the bodies, and move on.  So many options of doing almost anything during gameplay, you'll be spoiled of how to beat each mission...or come back later and beat it on a harder setting.  You can also pick up and throw bottles, coke cans, anything.  The whole process of the game is very cool. The graphics: In case you haven't heard, this game has some of the best graphics ever seen in a game.  One of my friend's walked in, sat down, not seeing the controller in my hand.  He thought I was watching a movie for a few seconds!  That's how good this game looks.  The lighting is fantastic.  Knock out all the lights, pitch black.  Leave a tiny bulb on, a lite glow fills the room.  Very cool!  Sam even changes.  He rolls up his sleeves, breathes in and out, steadies his gun when running so as to not make a clit, clat noise.  Etc...  So much detail put into everything.  Even things like when Sam's hands are busy (like hanging from a pole), he cocks his head up, then down, to get his night or heat vision goggles on.  Sooooooooooo realistic! Depth: Incredible!  On the normal setting, you'll be lucky to beat this game in less than 30 hours.  And the ability to go back and beat the game on hard later adds even more replay value!  This game has it all! Overall, this game rocked in every aspect.  Even sound (perhaps the best ever in a game) is ignored because of how good everything else is.  Voice acting is so realistic, as Sam always sounds confident, and yet sometimes doubtful, and even a bit nervous.  You can hear how fast you're running, the footsteps of approaching enemies, the true reloading of your gun (which ranges from silencers and snipers, to machine guns at times), and the shells falling to the floor. This is a classic, a must have, and any gamer should feel left out never playing Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell! (And oh, later on, you may be able to download new levels from the internet so your PC.  So cool!) Thx!	1
It wasn't that good at all. Constantly the same fighting all the time. It doesn't even follow the Two Towers story line! it follows Fellowship of the Ring! It would have been better if there was a two player mode, and a little more to it.	-1
This game is reallyyy fun! You can play every level with Legolas, Gimli or Aragorn! And a secret character. You'll fight bosses and millions of orcs. you can also choose which new move or what you want to buy with your experiance. The levels arnen't easy but not that hard. If the first game wasn't that good(I never got the first game) the sequal's awsome. the gme's short but loads of fun. If like lord of the rings movies and books this game is for you!	1
Do you like the Lord of the Rings? Well then this is your game! Overall, I thought this was a good game. Here are the baddies and the goodies. Baddies: -Pretty short -3 characters, 1 adventure -kind of hard -hard to get skill points -once you successfully beat a mission with a character, you can't do it again with that same person without putting a new game -bosses are too easy - can't be Gandalf Goodies: -play as Legolas, Gimli, or Aragorn -excellent moves and techniques -codes -interviews with the actors -good graphics -levels are exciting -cool weapons -bosses are easy You can even play secret missions with your guys and a secret character! Hope this a helpful review. Happy Hannukah! (just wanted to say that!)	1
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is one of the better games I've seen for Playstation 2 recently.  This game is very in-depth, and the graphics are rendered near-perfectly to match the scenes of the movie.  And the characters (you can play as Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, and Isuldur in the first level) are very life-life in their creation as well.  The only real flaw of this game is the fact that it should be made to have two player cooperation where you team with a friend and play through the levels.  But other than that this game is definitely worth every cent.  I would recommend though that you rent it first to make sure its for you, but I personally think its a great game for the Playstation 2.	1
This is a great keeper for the Playstation 2. It's probably overlooked because it's a game based on a movie and a book (games based on movies usually suck), and it's short. But I think it's one of the best games of 2002. You can play as either Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli. Each charecter has his own way of fighting. Aragorn is more of a normal hero, Legolas is fast but not very powerful, and Gimli is slow, but extremely tough. This is a hard game. Don't think that this is a walk in the park. I have yet to beat the last level. However, it is EXTREMELY fun. It's a simple 2d style gameplay (hack and slash) with great 3d graphics. And there are LOTS of enemies. When they said that there is 10,000 orcs in Helm's Deep, they might've put 10,000 orcs in the game version of Helm's Deep. They just keep coming! Also, the graphics are some of the best I've seen on the PS2. Very Mark Of Kri like. This is a great game. Go out and buy it. It has lots and lots of replay value.	1
Even though this game is rated Teen, my 10 year old beat all levels with all chacters in two days.  He was given the game by an 11 year old friend that had beaten it quickly, as well.  Unless you are a huge fan of the movie, your best bet would be to rent the game for a few days.	-1
This game is incredible!!  I first rented it just to see how it compared to Fellowship...  There is NO comparison.  I am still having fun learning more about the game and playing it through. But for all you LOTR fans out there, this is THE perfect video game, especially for how they incorporated the stories from the first two movies into this one game. EA did an amazing job and I highly recommend this game to any and every action/adventure gamer out there!	1
I own only two Playstation 2 Games as of this posting: "Medal of Honor: Frontline" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." This is a great game to play! Very exciting and dangerous, but it will take some time to get used to it! It can be pretty tough to play. The controls can get messy at times. But aside from this little problem, "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is an exciting piece of gaming that all fans and non-fans shall enjoy! Grade: A-	1
I got this game for Christmas, and played it all day almost. The graphics are beautiful (when they're not playing all the movie scenes that we've already seen), but there was a problem. IT WAS TOO HARD! I beat the first to levels, but on the Mines of Moria, I died at least 3 times before realizing the game was on "Normal". Yes, I always play video games on their easiest form (the first time, then when I beat that mode, I move up a level). Even set on "Easy", the game was a bit of a challenge. The reason for this was I wasn't killing my enemies correctly. I was pressing the 4 main buttons (Triangle, Circle, Box & X), when the only bottons that damage the enemies are the strong attack (Triangle) and X (the swift attack). Then I taught myself how to use the bow (by pressing and holding L1 and firing it with X). I beat the level up to the Watcher (the giant octopus), in which I died twice, until realizing how to defeat him. Once I beat the level, I went into the "Expirence Earned" section, in which you learn curtesy in the form of exp. points. When you kill enemies, you get rated on how good your combat was on defeating them: "fair", "good", "excellent" & "perfect". You get points for each one, but you get more points for (example) good to fair and "perfect" to "excellent". What can you buy? New combos (which you pretty much have to force yourself to remember), powered up arrows & axes (what Gimli throws), increased health & more. As you know, you can play as these three characters: Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli. Each has their own special combat features. Gimli's strong, but slow. And he's short, too, so it's a fr reach on enemies like Urah-Ki. Also, when he throws axes, it takes him longer than Aragorn & Legolas. Still, he's my second best fighter. Legolas, who I would've thought would have been my second, is my third best fighter. He fights merely on speed, and has hardly any strength, which is bad when fighting enemies like Cave Troll. He can hold the most arrows, though, a total of 60, and he shoots the fastest as well. My best character, Aragorn, is a mixture of both speed and strength. He can hold a maximum of 50 bows. Now, the reason this game's hard is because there's TOO many enemies. You can walk out into a field, and all of a sudden 10 sword-swining Urah-Kai can pop out and kill you instantly. Most levels take at least three tries even on "Easy". But, if you're unlike me and like extremely hard games, then you'll like this. But, if you're a Tolkein fan, that's an exception. It'll still be hard; but it'll be fun. P.s.: If you haven't already beaten the game, the secret character is Isildur. Man, I thought it would be Gandalf or even Gollum or someone...	1
I bought this game the week it came out and I was disappointed.  This game is really simple and easy.  An average gamer could beat it in about 2 days it they put there attention into it.  The game is simple you can either be gimli, strider, or legolas for most levels.  You go around killing orcs and Uruk hais and after completing a level you get a rating.  The rating can be fair, good, exellent, or perfect.  Then you can purchase new moves, and weapons with the points that you earn. This increases your level, too.  The moves are awesome except for the fact that you don't need them.  Most of the times you are going to be hitting on the same button repeatedly and have the same effect as the special moves do.  This is why I am giving it 4 stars.  Other than that the game is awesome except for the occasional dumb camera.  It has a lot of unlockables and a bonus level.  So go out and buy this game it is not only for a LOTR fan but for anyone who likes a decent hack and slash.	1
I picked this game up last week during a particularly boring day, not really expecting much of it (even though i'd read some decent reviews.) To my surprise, the game is actually one of the best film adaptations i have ever played, giving the great action & atmosphere of the films & some damn good playability as well. While it's true that the game isn't too challenging, it is incredibly good fun, & it's nice to see that the developers have actually taken the time to reward people who play through the game with some nice dvd-style bonus material. It was also a surprise to hear the true voices of the cast, which adds a lot to the atmosphere. Recommended for any fans of the movie, & anyone who likes a good action game.	1
These is such a cool game. It is a bit short I have to say though. It has actually movie sceens for The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers and the beginning of the Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring. In this game you can be Legolas, Airagon,or the short droft(I forgot his name my bad) as so as I have played. When each oif these players reacgs a certain level you get to see so cool stuff like what Ejah Wood thought of the game and what everyone else thought of it too. Some levels do get like really hard though like when you have to fight the  Ura-kai uglys god it took me like a hundred times to beat that level which got really boring. I particully memorised all the lines from hereing them so many times. The graphics are really cool and it's just like the movie. It gets hard and easy, it has it's ups and downs, but this really is a cool game. But I can't figure out why the Cave Troll looks so drunk. Guess I won't know. Well this si a great game and is totally recommended on my part. So go try it out.	1
I won't waste time telling you the specifics of how to play.  I just want to say that this game makes you feel like you are actually in the movie!  I am a huge LOTR fan, and this game is completely awesome!  If you are not a hardcare gamer, you can play it on the easy level and you won't get too frustrated and give up.  Not a big learning curve on this game either.  For more of a challange, there are normal and hard levels also.  I love how you can go back and play each segment with all the different characters.  The game starts with the prologue in the first movie, and proceeds from there with movie clips woven into the game.  You even get to fight as Isildur in the opening scene and watch him cut the ring from Sauron's hand.  Gameplay is also excellent on its own merits, and so it's not just another gimmick based on the movie.  I can't believe I waited so long to buy it... this is a *must own*!!!!	1
You'll be blown away from the opening sequence to the final showdown at helm's deep.  The graphic is one of the best I've ever seen on the PS2, and the control is fluid and easily controlled.  The muscial score from the movie is ported brilliantly, adding much to the sense of drama, and the added voices from the Actors playing the characters on the movie gave the game an authenticity that's not just a 'gee-whiz' feature. The transition sequence found on the cinematics has to be seen in action to be truly appreciated, although at times I was thrown off guard as the game starts seamlessly after the cinematics. The one problem (minor) I had was the confusion of trying to find my character in midst of 20 - 30 enemies and allies.  The only option is to just keep throwing off combos so you can see where you are at (there's a bright flash of light when you sucessfully finish a combo move). Game is on the easy side (even on the hardest difficulty level), but might be just me.	1
This game is incredible! The graphics, the musical score, the voices, the skills, the weapons, the liveliness, and the sound editing are all outstanding. They used the movie's characters' voices and the same scenes to make you feel like you're actually in the movie. The game makers went to extreme measures to make the game exactly like the movie. In this game you have to really speedy and tactical. One of the coolest things are the fact that you can choose who you want to play with. It's just like the Star Wars episode 1 game, where you can play as Obi-Wan, as Qui-Gon Jinn, as Queen Amidala, and as Panaka. In this game you can play as Aragorn, Gimli, or as Legolas. Legolas is definitely the best player (hands down). You'll love fighting you way through thousands of Orcs, goblins, and Uruk-kai. You'll also be battling enormous or dangerous monsters like the cave troll and Saruman. The game is even more fun if you use the maximum ammo cheat (While playing the lord of the rings the two towers pause the game and hold R1 R2 L1 L2. While doing this enter x, down, triangle, and up). The other cheats (the skip level codes) will just spoil the game. The levels: As you know you play with Aragorn (the human), Gimli (the dwarf), or with Legolas (the elf). With each completed mission, you obtain skill points depending on how you dispatch your enemies and are also given the alternative to purchase new and lethal moves. Overall, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a first-class game. The only nuisances, however, are its replay worth. The missions are usually recurring, and you only have 16 missions. Sooner or later you no longer consider playing it. It's not like the Star Wars games, Tomb Raider games, James Bond games, Tony Hawk's games, N4S games, Theft games, or other games where almost every level is different. Despite this slight downfall, `The Two Towers' will offer you with sufficient entertainment until you finish the game. If you enjoy this, also check out "James Bond 007: Nightfire", "Tony Hawks 4", "Angel of the darkness", and "Hp and the chamber of secrets".	1
I'm in a Lord of the Rings mood right now. Watching the movie, reading the book and anticipating the theatrical release of the Two Towers so I decided to check it out. Now first, this is actually quite fun, albeit in some places a little frustrating. Story: Basically this follows the beginning of Fellowship(the battle with Isildur at the base of Mount Doom) to the end of the first half of Two Towers(Helm's Deep). Even though they may have skipped some parts story wise it follows the books greatly. Graphics: Wow. These are some great graphics. Dynasty Warriors 2 had some pretty blah backgrounds but LOADS of enemies and allies. This has maybe 10 at once to 20 but the locations look great. Plus the transition from actual movie footage to CG is near flawless. Music: They included many of the voices of the movie so that's always a plus. Battle cries, swords and other good stuff is featured. The music is great and keeps the scene moving(you don't wanna fight 10 monsters at once with boring romantic music do you?) Gameplay: Now, button mashers beware. You might like this. You really got to pay attention to your combos. Simple pressing random buttons won't get you far. Another problem I had is I was using Legolas and I got up to the second part of Helm's Deep fighting an endless array of enemies and fighting out I'm a little weak. In most RPG's you can go back to level up and get better enhancements to help. This is just "if you're at Level 5 and you barely have enough skills to continue then sorry, keep going." But other than that, it's quite a fun game and urge you to try it out regardless if you're into Lord of the Rings or not.	1
This is a fun game with incredible graphics, movie clips, and voice acting. It's somewhat linear however (you can only move on the paths) instead of free-roaming.  There are a lot of extra features included on the disc (cast interviews, production pictures, etc.) which adds to the entertainment value.  This is currently the best Lord of the Rings game available. If you are getting this game, here is a code that will help you:  Start a mission, then pause and hold down L1, L2, R1, and R2, and press Triangle, Down, X, Up in sequence.  You will hear a sound if you have done it right, and your health meter will be completely refilled every time you do it.	1
My ONLY complaint about this game, and I could be wrong as I only rented it, is that it appeared to be to short/to short of a path to the end of the game.  It is still worth seeing for its jaw dropping combats and action.  My only reservation about buying it is I am unsure about how much replayability it has.	1
This is an awsome game! This game is perfect for any fan of the movie series. this game easily blows the Fellowship Of The Ring out of the water. The game is very similar to Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3. You simply pick to play as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli. You then go through a level normally killing about 300 enemies and face one huge boss at the end. Each level (17 in all) has a boss at the end. The bosses are very easy to defeat if you know the correct way of beating them. Each one requires a different strategy. The game has very good graphics, some of the best I have seen on the PS2 I might add. Once you beat the level you are awarded experience points, that you can use to purchase combos, new axes or bows, or even extra armor. The only downside however is the fact that you can beat the game with one character in about 6 hours. So 3X6=18 hours of gameplay. But you can play longer to unlock new scenes from the film and interveiws with the cast. Overall, it is a must buy for any fan!	1
LOTR: The Two Towers is simply a blast. It is an action packed romp right smack dab through the middle of Middle Earth. The game pretty much closely follows the action scenes through the first and second movies of New Line's cinematic adaptation of the Tolkien trilogy. A player starts out as Isildur battling the Orc minions(much like the opening scene of Fellowship of the Ring). Then you move on to the various battle scenes in Fellowship and in the new movie The Two Towers.   The game is an all out action game with charaters having a short range weapon (Aragorn-sword, Legolas- Knives, and Gimli- Battle Axe) as well as a long ranged attack(Aragorn and Legolas- Bows and Gimli- hand held throwing hatchets). You basically fight full speed through hordes and hordes of Orcs, Uruk-Hai, and Trolls. There are some bosses along the way, but the bulk of the battle is against Sauron's footsoldiers. Do not expect any food gathering, strategy, or exploration. This is not an RPG in any form or fashion. It is a pure mission based game much like Devil May Cry(only set in Middle Earth). If you buy the game knowing this then you should be in for a great treat. GRaphics- The graphics are stunning. The character models look great(faces are not THAT great), the enemies look just like the Orcs and Uruk-Hai in the movie, and the backgrounds are lavish as well. Even when over 50 objects are fighting on screen there is absolutley no slowdown. I have not seen a PS2 game yet that can produce as many on screen enemies without slowdown. Simply a Beautiful game. The cut scenes are great as well as the story flows from movie to game almost seamlessly. Gameplay-- Wonderful if you like intense upgradeable hand-to-hand combat. There are many combos to perform, and a player learns more as the game goes on. *The only drawback to this game is its length. Some gamers have reported beating this game in one setting. I just don't see how. I am a seasoned gamer, and I have played this game for two weeks and cannot beat it. I think those people are playing on the "easy" setting, which I do not recommend. Anyways, if you like Tolkien, the movies, and great action/combo hack em' ups then go purchase this game today. **I almost forgot to mention that the game has probably 15 minutes or more of movie footage, interviews, and other unlockables as well as a secret level and character that you can unlock. I need a holiday Gandalf.....a long Holiday!	1
This game looks and plays absolutely brilliant. Be forwarned, though, it's a tough one but well worth playing through. There's wave after wave of battles with one enemy after another from The Lord of the Rings universe. Yet, what makes this game truly shine is that you get experience points that you can use to get new fighting moves and weapons. Working up the levels in your characters has never been more fun. There's even interviews with key people from the movie for you to see, even scenes from the new movie. JRR Tolkien would be proud if he were still here to see the fine job that they've did making his book come alive in this game. If you're a Lord of the Rings fan, or if you just love the thrill of the fight in games such as this, you owe it to yourself to check out The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers. It's without a doubt the best looking game I've seen on the PS2 thus far.	1
Those who have been burned by Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring for the PS2 should quickly forget that wretch of a game and give a good look to Electronic Arts' Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  You get to play as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli as you fight your way through 11 levels of pure hack & slash action.  The first half of the game is based on events in the first installment of the series, with the second half featuring events in the second installment.  Graphic wise the game is top notch, these are some of the best graphics to be seen on the PS2 yet.  Character models look like they're film counterparts and the animation is silky smooth.  Slowdown is minimal at best, even when there are hordes of enemies on screen at once.  Control is tighter than I could have ever expected, the easy targeting system and easy to execute chain attacks are very well done and simple to execute.  The action moves at a very fast pace, so fast that you might be able to finish the game in one or two sittings; this alone is the game's biggest flaw but there are a few extras.  Judging by your level by level performance, you can unlock extra features like a survival mode and even see video interviews with members of the film's cast.  All in all, if your a fan of the license (or old school action games like Golden Axe) and you were burned by the PS2 Fellowship of the Ring, check out EA's Two Towers, you won't regret it.	1
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, is a truly fun and amazing action game.  The game takes place across the first two films, in, of course, Middle Earth.  You can take take the place of Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli.  All of which have their ups and downs.  Legolas is the weakest character, but the fastest, utilizing his two daggers and bow.  Gimli, being quite slow, is a beastly tank wielding a battle-axe and smaller axes for throwing.  Aragorn lies right in the middle of the two.  He uses a sword and bow.  The graphics in this game are superb, everything from the character models to the tree leaves.  All the characters look almost exactly like their movie counter-parts, with the exception of Gimli.  He doesn't look right, his face looks squintish and pushed in...  The levels themselves have a substantial amount of detail and lighting.  For instance, in the level "Balin's Tomb" where you get the cave troll, the beam of light that shines upon the stone casket looks amazing.  The levels are very closely related to the movies (well I can only tell that by looking at the first film for the second is not out yet) and I instantly recognized them.  Cutscenes from the movies are integrated throughout the levels.  This includes a large amount of clips from LOTR: The Two Towers.  The gameplay is also very fun and has one of the best "archery systems" I've seen.  Music from the movies is incorporated throughout the game as well.  Also packed with the game are a lot of special features (like those from a DVD) including "the making of..." and character interviews.  All in all, this is an excellent game and I recommend it to any action or Tolkien fan. Killing the goblis/orcs/uruk-hai, is a blast, so buy this game.  LETS HUNT SOME ORC	1
To be honest, Rainbow six series was Great when it came out, but I guess it was tooooo great  so the sequels looked unfinished and disappointing(not giving new improvements).   I'm not sure this new RS will be Great, but it is different from other RS games. This time they're using the unreal engine instead of the in-house engine. This makes the game look professinal and will give the players new action.   And improved AI. They act more real, like checking their backs for bad guys and do more things than you just ordered to do.   Easy to use controls. You don't need to memorize the complicated short keys to take action, I don't know excatly but it'll be more easy to use.   This game might not be great, but I think it'll give us some new action and fun.	1
EA has done an outstanding job of porting the movie over to a video game. We even get to see lots of movie scenes from the as-yet-unreleased The Two Towers! This game has killer graphics combined with voice-acting straight from the movie, as well as fun and frustrating addictive gameplay. This game is pure hack n' slash action - you can choose to be either Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli (I like Gimli). You play thru a lot of fight scenes from The Fellowship of the Ring - the Ringwraiths on Amon Hen, the Kraken, the Mines of Moria and the Cave troll, the Uruk-Hai on the bank of the river. And then you get to fight thru all the scenes in the upcoming Two Towers. The replay value is high, too. You can play thru all the scenes and strive to attain better ratings with all 3 characters. You earn experience points that you can use to purchase combos that deal more damage. Whenever you kill an enemy, it flashes briefly Fair, Good, Excellent, or Perfect. This score is determined by how well you avoid getting hit (or execute a well-timed parry), and pulling off brutal combos. I cannot stress enough how impressed I am with this game. Be aware that this game is PURE BATTLE ACTION. It plays much differently than the also newly released game The Fellowship of the Ring, which has a more action/RPG feel to it (it is also a very well done game that I am adventuring thru).	1
Though two games have recently been released that bear "The Lord of the Rings" title, one is based upon the motion picture franchise, and the other is based upon its creators' adaptation of the books. "The Fellowship of the Ring" is played in sequence with an ongoing storyline, and generally favors plot over action. "The Two Towers," on the other hand, favors action over plot. The plot is back there behind the curtains, of course, but those who haven't read the books or seen the films won't be able to make heads or tails of it. Being a Tolkien zealot, so to speak, and an avid supporter of the first film as well, I found "The Two Towers" to be a mixed bag. It sometimes borders on greatness, but then falls short. Why? Well, let me begin with what the game does well.  First of all, the gameplay is fast, intense, and relentless, and it generally mimics key moments from the films. Yes, there are a handful of moments from "The Fellowship of the Ring" as well as the upcoming "Two Towers."  The production values go above and beyond. Several of the film's key players are on hand to vocalize their gaming counterparts, which goes a long way toward injecting you with that "Wow, I'm in the movie!" sensation. On top of this, Howard Shore's rousing soundtrack throbs during the action, giving you that much incentive to "hunt some orc." The sound effects and the graphics are splendid as well, and further give you the sensation of being there.  The game's transitions between film footage (some good "Two Towers" preview moments here!) and in-game graphics are worthy of honorable mention.  "The Two Towers" allows you to play as Aragorn, Gimli, or Legolas, and each of them have their own particular abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. They can also acquire experience points which can be used to purchase new orc-dispatching attacks. The addition of these three playable characters is vastly important, because it gives a short, linear game some replay value it might have lacked.  For fans of the films, there are interviews, documentaries, and other goodies that can be unlocked during the course of the game.  "The Two Towers" is challenging, but rarely frustrating (with the possible exception of the Plains of Rohan stage, which played havoc with my temper).  The game's most fascinating missions involve epic battles, like those that take place at the fortress of Helm's Deep. These moments are extremely memorable, and you'll want to play them again and again. Alas! All is not perfect in this valiant effort. Here are some of the game's failings.  The gameplay isn't story-driven, and for the uninitiated, it won't make much sense (but, then, why are you even playing this game if you're not a fan already?).  Missions leap from one story sequence to another without warning. For instance, you go from playing as Aragorn defending Frodo on Weathertop immediately to the mines of Moria, and there aren't any cut-sequences that actually smooth the transition. The clips that do pop up between levels are essentially promotional campaigns for the upcoming film, and not story-driving elements. It's jarring.  The game tries for camera angles reminiscent of those seen in the films, but which are usually functional as well. However, in every game that has a fixed camera, problems do occur, and they can be very annoying. Fortunately, it's the exception rather than the rule.  The action is very arcade-like, and feels like a cutting edge Double Dragon clone. The play mechanics are essentially the same. You slug it out with opponents while traveling a very linear path from which you cannot veer for any reason. Times have changed since Double Dragon, naturally, so this is the best variation of the formula I've ever seen, but it remains an aging gameplay mechanic. It's not for everybody.  Timed missions involve too much trial and error (especially the aforementioned Plains of Rohan level, which is particularly frustrating).  You can't skip all of the video sequences, even if you've seen them a hundred times.  The game isn't as true to the source material as it should be - and when I refer to the source material, I mean the books, as it's early November and the next film won't hit theaters until mid-December. Fortunately, most of these deviations are acceptable in the spirit of the gameplay, provided you're not a less open-minded Tolkien fan than I am. I just hope the movie doesn't take so many liberties with this beloved tale. I tend to trust Mr. Jackson after such a successful adaptation of book 1, however, and I digress...  The single most disappointing thing about this game is its length. This game is excruciatingly short, and experienced and dedicated players should have it conquered within a few hours. It may have incentive to replay it from the beginning, but that's still not as cool as a longer campaign would have been.  No chance to duke it out with the Balrog. Argh! So, in the end, I recommend this game to fans of non-stop action gaming, but it is important that you also know at least a little about the storyline that is moving things along behind the scenes. On top of this, you must be willing to deal with the game's shortcomings (and I do mean SHORTcomings, because the game is over so bloody quickly!). As far as Tolkien zealots go, be warned that the game strays from the storyline at times in favor of visceral gaming. However, if I can handle that, I'm sure you can as well. When it's all said and done, this is a fine product worthy of your time. Final Grade: B- (or 4 stars, to grade on a curve)	1
Finally, a good game to go along with the "Lord of the Rings" movies.  In this game, you can be Gimli, Legolas, or Aragorn, and you fight your way through various scenes from the first two movies.  Each character has his own unique fighting style, and each can earn experience and upgrades as you progress. The graphics in this game are absolutely beautiful.  The fighting is very realistic, and the characters are surprisingly detailed--no stiff-moving polygons here.  There are many short clips from the movies.  Overall, the appearance is very nice. The gameplay is also great.  Yes, 95% of this game is just punching the buttons and killing stuff.  But it's fun.  And there are many different combos your characters can learn which are actually kind of difficult to execute.  You are rated with each kill based on your style and use of parries, thrusts, blocks, and combinations.  It's easy to kill stuff, but very hard to do it elegantly and get the perfect score. The downside to this game is that it's very short--you can beat it in one night.  Still, though, even once you've passed the game you can go back with different characters and, when that's done, you can always try to improve your rating on each level.  I've been through the game many times, and still I'm entertained. If you've been looking for the perfect beat-'em-up fighting game, look no further.  And, if you're a LOTR fan (like me) you won't be disappointed.  Get this game.  It's worth it.	1
After reading previous reviews I don't think anyone over 12 who is not a LOTR geek has reviewed this game. So here's my two cents. This was a great idea. The guy at the game store said it's a lot like DYNASTY WARRIORS. NOT!!! Not even close. While it's pretty to look at and has great cuts from the movie, it's basically a pretty lame fighting game. Terribly sluggish control bogs down any furious action mashing game play. Control is very unresponsive for my taste. Scoring any kind of combo is trial and error and unfair. It all about timing. I felt like I was playing KENGO. I want blazing speed in my HACK AND SLASH BATTLE GAMES. Timed moves are for Wrestling Games.(SIGH) The levels are pretty shallow and the camera is FIXED. FIXED FOR GOODNESS SAKE!!! HEY!! WHERE DID MY GUY GO? Bad idea. Onimusha does this so much better. THE TWO TOWERS is beautiful to look at, but as any serious gamer knows, game play is everything. And THE TWO TOWERS is just not that fun. Once again someone has made a mediocre game to cash in on a hot frachise. Too bad. If you're looking for a game that puts you into the heart of an hour long battle buy DYNASTY WARRIORS 2 or 3. It's far superior. And way more fun. Or if you don't mind fixed camera action go for Onimusha 1 or 2. Avoid THE TWO TOWERS. It's short and disappointing. What does DURABILITY mean in the Rating? Replay value? We're reviewing video games here, people, not TONKA TOYS. EDUCATIONAL? Yeah, I learned what a sore thumb feels like. Rated M: for Mediocre. LATE!!!	-1
I'm a HUGE fan of Lord of the Rings so I bought both games the moment they game out. The other Lord of the Rings game is based on the book, and just on the FIRST book. It's VERY short and a puzzle-adventure. In comparison, The Two Towers is based on the first TWO MOVIES, NOT the books. And it is a straight button-bashing fighting game. The up side of both of these games is that they're great Aragorn-fun. The down side of both of these games is that both are WAY TOO SHORT. At least in this one you really CAN play all three characters. After the first two levels (a prologue and Weathertop) you can now choose, on each level, to be Aragorn, Gimli or Legolas. Each character has his own fighting style, from Gimli's little battle-tankness to Legolas' great double-sword action, to Aragorn's lean ranger fighting. Yes, I love Aragorn's fighting style :) This game, being based on the movie, has TONS of detail from the movie. They worked with the actual actors for the voices, and got their hands on the actual movie models for the game sets. You can see the attention to detail. There are all sorts of 'special features' where you can watch interviews with the actors and see photos from the second movie. So it's sort of like an interactive preview of Movie 2! It is SHORT thought. You can run the game through on a character in about 5 hours. Then you just run through again as the other 2. There's a secret character and level, but that's about it. There are no puzzles, no quests, it's all just bash-through-the-enemies-and-then-bash-at-the-boss. Either the boss is easy - if you find his weakness - or he is REALLY NASTY and VERY VERY FRUSTRATING. A bit of tuning needed to be done in here. And again, where the other game had at least a bit of thinking involved, this one is solely mash-mash-mash those buttons. Still, it's really great to be "in the movie" and hear the familiar soundtrack and voices around you. A must have for any Lord of the Rings fan - and if it's short, just spend the rest of the time trying to get a PERFECT score on every level, and watching all the videos that come with the game!	1
The Two Towers has to be the best movie based game I've ever played. It has everything a fan of the movie could want. It's like being in the movie, the graphics,detail and gameplay is just perfect. The games only problem is that it sorta rushes itself , I mean the 4th board and you're in Moria already fighting the cave troll. Plus after that part, you're out of Moria without even fighting the Belrog or even seeing it in a  cut movie seen for that matter. Think they cut that out because you can't play as Gandalf and since he's a big part of that part it wouldn't make sense I guess to play it without being him.  Speaking of the cut scenes it's great how it jumps from the actual live action scenes in the movie to the games version of those scenes before each level.   Well anyway it's too bad you can't be Gandalf, as that'd be pretty cool. Can't be Frodo either but I'm glad because all through the Moria scene you hear nothing but Frodo whining stuff like "help me Gandalf", so he's pretty wimpy, lol. You can be Aragorn, Legolis or Gimli though. All in all this game is pretty fun but hard too as you have so many orcs coming at you at once. I read a review that said the game is too short and that you can beat it in 5 hours. Well you have to be really good to beat this game in one day as it's really challenging.	1
I'm a grad of Team Tactics and Anti-Terrorist training schools. With that in mind this is how I break out Raven Shield.    First off the graphics were great, quite a step up from Rogue Spear.  The graphics really require a top notch video card, I tried running the game originally on a 128 card an it was very glitchy.  Once I upgraded to a 256 card, things smoothed out and I had no more problems.    Game Play.  Pros: Team planning allows you to adjust the the number of team members used, the equipment they use, and the load out of weapons. Most importantly you can control entry to each and every room.    Teams move in actual team fashion, entering rooms in either storm or zipper fashion, and they are far better shots than you.    Story line, although perhaps a tad hollywood fantasy, it was engaging and you wondered what you'd uncover next. I usually hate little cinamatics between levels, but these were great!    Weapons choice is great, remember to outfit your guys with weapons YOU are comfortable using. The game in intrest of emulating the armed forces of the commandos you are pretending to be or maybe just to get you to use other weapons, loads you out with all sorts of useless weapons, so make sure you change them to what YOU like. I especialy liked the acuaracy differences between the weapons as well as knock down differences.    Armor and Cammo selection. It was great that you could pick your cammo, which made it easy to differentiate between your teams by giving each team a specific color of cammo. I also like that you were nosier and slower in heavier armor.    Cons: In a tactical team you have the lead man or point, the tail end charlie and in between you have utility men.  Now the hardest thing about learning team tactics is trusting each member of your team to cover his line of fire.  I can't tell you how often my Utility man would rush ahead of me and block my line of fire, then get shot himself.  While engaging my target, my team members would often ignore their target to engage my target.    Team members not under my direct control would walk cheerfully into ambushes.  I would often have to clear ambushes in their sector before I could send them on.  Eventually I structured my assualts so that the other teams would cover my back to prevent terrorist from circling around while I cleared out all the bad guys.    A terrorist that can't be brought down by a 7.62 round fired from an asualt rifle, can easily take you out at long range with a pistol in one shot through your heavy kevlar.    Unlike Rogue Spear, this AI just could not get flash banging a room right.  If you told one of your teams to flash a room before entering they would get themselves shot to pieces first then flashbang themselves. Not that it mattered, Flashbangs didn't seem to effect the terrorist at all. While your team stumbles around, the terrorist would pick you off from the very spot that the grenade went off.    Although I listed a lot of cons, overall I love the Rainbow six series. It is very realistic as far as the tactics needed to accomplish the missions. The weapons have kick. Your ability to shoot is comprimised by wounds. Team members that are not snipers have a tougher time using the sniper rifles. The missions were great. I espesially love that the bad guys don't show up in the same spots each time. I love being able to swap team members out and that as you use them they get better at certain jobs, like leadership if you put them in charge of team. I highly recommend this game.  I didn't even go into how much fun this game is online. If you like FPS, then the Rainbow series is hands down the very best.	1
This game is very realisic. And one of the best things about it is there is a whole line up of weopons to choose from, going from 50 M82A1 sniper rifles, to M60s, to AK47's, to M16's.  But this game can become very boring after a while.  For people who like to do stealthy kind of missions... BUY IT!!!!  For people who like to grab an M60, scream "CHARGE", and run at the enemy's base while sparying bullets in all directions... DON'T BUY IT!!!! buy BattleField Vietnam!!!!	1
Speaking theatrically for a moment, there's an important, and oft confused distinction between the terms 'realistic' and 'naturalistic'. Naturalism seeks to show its audience a slice of sensory reality; that is, something that looks, sounds, even smells like real life.  Realism, on the other hand tries to show the real truth about life - not the costumes or lights of the stage, but the relationships, tension and drama of the world. Raven Shield, the latest in the Rainbow Six series, is a healthy helping of both.  As such, it's not really fair to describe this title as a totally 'Realistic' action game.  There's no such thing.  What you do get is a highly charged and tension wracked experience that features a great many lifelike moments, packed with guns and gadgets and hours of enthralling gameplay. As part of the elite Special Forces organization 'Rainbow', it's your job to lead a team of highly trained soldiers to thwart the machinations of evil, gun-toting baddies.  You get to equip your team, plan your attack, and lead your troops in the 1st Person, much the same as previous titles in the series.  There's a lot in common with the game's predecessors - an emphasis on stealth, team tactics and accurate shooting, especially when there are hostages involved.  The game world is lovingly created, from the mission planning stage where you kit out your agents, to the huge interactive environments you'll be stalking through.  Ubisoft has positively crammed detail into this game, and visually it's by far the most striking of the series.  If your video card is up to the job you'll be treated to lush, high-res graphics with plenty of environmental effects, such as swaying trees, billowing smoke, fluffy snowflakes and more.  All the weapon models and animations look fabulous, and you can see each weapon and grenade dangling from the belts of your troops as you lead them into action. Equally the sound is top notch, with bullets that positively sizzle past your head, and convincing speech from your team...nothing beats hearing 'tango's down' crackling over your headset.  There's plenty of ambient sound to enjoy as well, and the game rewards players who pay attention to subtleties like footsteps, or doors creaking open. The game AI is robust and versatile, though its here that many players tend to throw around the word 'realistic' in disparaging tones.  Sure, there's room for improvement - your team occasionally gets disoriented when traversing doors or ladders, and the enemy intelligence will sometimes ignore your gunfire, or the death of a nearby colleague.  Still, these occasions are infrequent, and on the whole the game puts on a good show, considering it's responsible for up to 7 computer controlled commandos and dozens of terrorists in one level. Coupled with a robust and enjoyable multiplayer mode, Raven Shield has almost all the bases covered for a tactical shooter.  My expectations in the realism department are catered for, and then some, with tons of options and weapons to play with (over 50), all based on their real life counterparts.  'Based on' is a good way to describe how true to life this game is...if you want something more convincing I suggest you uninstall and never again play this game after you first die - hey, no second chances in the wet-works department.  For everyone else in search of a thoughtful and highly atmospheric shooter, this latest adventure should sneak its way into your collection; and then flash-bang the pants off it!	1
All i can say is this game is incredible all around.  just another great Tom Clancy product.  the use of the Unreal engine makes quite a difference.  i loved SWAT3 more than anything and though this game isn't quite as good, in regards to Team control, it's definitely 2nd in my book.	1
This game blows all other rainbow six games by FAR. This one has some of the best FPS AI I have encountered. They pin you down, take cover, plan ahead, and many more things. The graphics are downright great. Your gun fires and all of the peices move just like a real gun. any attachment to your gun will appear on-screen with you, which is a nice little graphical feature. The gore is in the right place. There isn't much except blood splatters on the wall when bullets penetrate your target. The levels are well thought out and fun to play in. There are lots of interactive elements such as glass, barrels of explosive stuff and a few other cool things. The team playing and planning on this game is the main focus. You must coordinate all of your teams to work in unison and clear the stage together as many points in the game are guarded by two or more differnt lines of fire. The campaign is fun to play and is a pretty good storyline, not that it really matters. You will be focusing on blowing terrorists away steathily and so precisely that you get the feel of being in the game as a professional anti-terrorist operative. It is really fun to run and whack all of the terrorists with your MP5-SD. Don't think that you can just run and gun in this game though, the terrorist reaction time is quick. The difficulty levels are vastly different. Elite can get your team killed in a hurry, but recruit will allow players to get the feel of the game while still having a challenge. The weapon selection is much larger than in the other rainbow six games too. You get plenty of cool weapons, and most all of them can be silenced which adds a degree of customizability. Smoke grenades and Flashbangs are to be used much more in this game. Terrorists will no longer fire right through smoke. You can use it for cover and use thermalscopes to snipe them. You can use tear gas to make them scatter too, but without a mask you will be affected too. The effects of all of the grenades are graphically impressive too. Your vision becomes blurred and delayed with gas, and an image is burned on your retinas when you see a flash. Your ears will ring like in real life on the game when loud noises are close to you (grenades and explosions only). The only thing i can complain about is that you go to like 2 or 3 stages twice in the same campaign. There is a variation in each however. Like changing from day/night or unlocking new parts of it. This game also has infinite replay value as you can adjust difficulty level and number of operatives. The only thing more rewarding than clearing a stage on elite level is clearing it with only one player. The game engine that it runs on (unreal I think?) is AWESOME. The ragdoll physics are so awesome. You can shoot people and they don't fall down in a pre-animated way, they fall up agaist walls and objects like in real life. Making people fall down stairs and ledges is ultra-rewarding. You should not be distracted too easily with the awesome graphics however, the terrorists aren't brain-dead this time and will kik your booty if you jack around. So buy this game and feel what it is like to be an anti terrorist operative! P.S. I cannot reveiw the online play because my area has no highspeed internet and its unplayable with dialup. But I hear it is just as fun as rogue spear (which i played like 2 years in a row online every chance i got) P.P.S You better have a nice computer for the graphics to be good if you buy the computer version. I give it 10+/10	1
I cant stress that enough.  The single player campaign is just filler for what is offered when you play online.  I haven't even played 5 whole missions in single player even though i have owned this game for months.  The sinlge player game is fun, but can be tedious when trying to coordinate a mission plan that won't kill your team AI.  They tend to get themselves shot when you aren't managing them directly. The multiplayer part of this game is so addictive, its insane.  THis is some of the best cooperative play I have ever experienced.  Of course a deathmatch or team-deathmatch style is offered, cooperative is my favorite.  There are other game types as well, including hostage resues, bomb disarmings, and escorts where the other team has to prevent a pilots escape and sometimes YOU are the pilot.  All in all, taking out terrorists with online pals is the most rewarding.  The game has an excellent interface that automatically downloads new maps, textures, and sounds when you join a new server that is playing a new map. Its so easy to use. If you're not into multiplayer or have a bad internet connection, perhaps this title isn't for you.  If you think you will really enjoy the single player game or have tried the multiplayer demo and loved it, get this game.  Take out some tangos with some friends online.  Dont have any friends online?  You end up making pals when you join the same couple servers every day and keep seeing the same people.  Its very social and ther are rarely any creeps playing cooperatively. I would have given a 4 and a half because the single player isn't quite as engrossing as the mulitplayer.	1
Well, maybe no best game, but a lot of fun. I just did that to get your attention. Anyway, it's incredibly realistic. Every gun has its goods and bads, the graphics are just crazy and the gameplay is incredibly addictive. At first you'll just look at damage, then accuracy, then range on the gun's stats. But slowly you'll realize ho important some of the other things are such as stability and recovery. You'll then realize how deep it really is. Plus, with Up to 3 customizations for each gun (Thermal Scope, Sound SUppressor, Mini Scope, Hi_capacity Mag, etc.) You get over 150 combinations. The levels are fun, challenging and intuitive. Plus, it's not like CS or Unreal where you can just charge in guns a'blazin'. (I know that sounded redneckish) You really have to strategize. Do I open the dorr all the way and unload my G3A3, or do I nudge it open just an inch so no one notices and toss in a flashbang? Or, do I toss in some tear gas and blow them to pieces as they rush out coughing? My only gripe would be that the single-player game is very difficult. You'll ant to practice a lot before you attempt them. However, that just means I'll enjoy it longer.	1
This is a great tacticle first person shooter.  Be warned action shooter fans this probly isn't for you, this game requires patience and you probly just won't breeze through every level on the first try.  I also found some of the later mission a bit on teh difficutl side.  There is a stealth mission which requires you not to be seen let alone shoot someone which I found very out of place and frustrating.  I'd also like the adress the issue of how it will run.  Anther review somewhere areound here said that it will definately run fine on an nvidia card (from personal experience) but didn't know how it would work on an ati card.  I'm running an ati card, have everything cranked to max and it runs perfect.  Actually I believe the game is ati optimised seeing an ati advertisement packaged with the game.  Now back to how the game plays.  This game is a hyperrealistic fps if yourve never played a rainbow six game before, 1-2 shots kills you.  I found the multiplayer fun, but it isn't for everyone, its a counterstrike inspired multiplayer game in most aspects, once your dead your out of the round.  As a whole this isdefinatly a fun game, but not for everyone.	1
Ok, before I say anything let me remark that you should be buying this game for the multiplayer gaming. Why? Because this is where it really shines. If you are looking for a single player game, this is still an excellent game yet I would rate it four and a half stars if that is what your looking for. Either way it is a title to definitely put into your collection. Read on and I'll let you know why:  First, as you are probably already aware, the Unreal engine is used for this game which produces fantastic visuals, moody environments and a believable sense of immersion--all the things that a FPS really needs right? It doesn't stop there however. The gameplay is tense and each second leading up to the next staccato of gunfire will leave you anxious and gleeful. It is a perfect mix of first person action with a serious dose of realism charged into it.  That leads to the tactical part of the game. Unlike Unreal Tournament, Quake Arena and others that are of the FPS Genre, Rainbow Six has established itself as a premiere tactical shooter. If you've played others in the Rainbow Six series you'll be familiar with the style, otherwise let me put it this way:  Combat is extremely lethal and is quite final in its outcome. Someone will die and they will stay dead--at least during the match at hand. Bullets can wound but more often than not, they kill. Guns mimic their real life counterparts. The muzzles flare toward the ceiling when you let your fully automatic weapon unload. Reloading can take precious moments during a heated firefight. Each weapon holds various pros and cons that need to be considered for a coming engagement. Yet, for all it's worth the weapons are only a fractional part of the tactics involved.  Doors can be opened "fluidly"--that is slowly and not completely. Enough for you to toss a flashbang or peek inside at the tango lingering within. Corners can be leaned around in a "fluid" and natural manner. Your choice of approach into an area can mean instant death or heartfluttering success. Tactics matter far more than mere rampage.  During multiplayer gaming you can even use a map to give brief direction and instruction to your mates, coordinating your attack on computer controlled tangos (i.e., terrorists) or witty and ever sinister human controlled opponents.  Gameplay online really makes this game blossom into its full potential and offers co-operative and adversarial play with several game types sure to fill your attention. While the single player game is well done, it is a bit repetitive and short. In fact, several of the maps are reused during later missions, meaning that you'll have to carry out a mission at the same location only under different conditions (i.e. at night, etc.).  If you like to edit games, you will also find that the available content feels a bit sparse compared to others that use the Unreal engine as a basis. Still, it is adequate and will be familiar if you've ever edited for Unreal before with only slight variations to the standard.  Overall it's a worthwhile game that should belong on the shelf of everyone that enjoys FPS games. Even if FPS games aren't your standard game of choice, this one deserves to be one of the rare times that you pick up one from the genre. Undoubtedly there are many hours of gameplay for both the single and multiplayer interest.	1
In a nutshell Raven Shield does a lot right in a pretty package but suffers from the same pitfalls of past games. The game sticks to the same winning formula of the past titles. For the most part this is a good thing. The first thing the player sees in the game is a number of slick looking menus. These have been revised from past games to make them more player friendly. They are all well done with dramatic music and familiar voice over. R6s' famous planning phase is intact and still not as easy to use as it should be. Clicking to place waypoints for your team seems easy enough until you click on an area that you can't put a waypoint at, like overlapping another waypoint. There is no indication that you can't do this, and in game it doesn't matter one way or another, there isn't a good reason why the game won't let you. It can get picky about other things, such as putting waypoints too close to walls or doors. Assigning your team to toss a [explosive item] in to a room can be tricky. You might want them to toss it clear across the room and find out that it's out of range or there is some object blocking LOS that is not obvious on the map. So you have to keep clicking on the map until you find a spot that the game will let you assign a [explosive item] toss waypoint to. You can avoid this pain in the neck if you use a default pre-made plan. There should be nothing that makes your own planning such a hassle however. Of course the actual meat of the game is the action. Rainbow Six really shines here for giving you a mix of stealth, suspense, loud gun battles, impressive [explosive item] effects, and team tactics. The new first person gun models look great.  The vast number of [firearms] all sound distinct and are very impressive. The HUD has been cleaned up and better laid out. Another new feature is adding other equipment to your [firearms], like a scope or a silencer. Your team can now be given dynamic orders outside the plan via an easy to use pop up menu. Watching them breach, flashbang and clear a room is interesting and just plain cool. With Ghost Recon it seems that Rainbow isn't going to be outdoors much. With the Unreal powered engine one would think they could toss in a few missions hunting down [criminal] camps. So most of the time you play a high tech SWAT team rather than a real spec-op unit. Not all is well. The AI is a hit or a miss, and this is usually a weak point for Red Storm. The enemy AI is very good. It will try to flank you, flush you out with [explosive item], and go for reinforcement or when they know they are out gunned they will surrender. Yet it doesn't do this in any clever manner. A [criminal] might run from a frag [explosive item], and run in to your team and get chopped down. Often they will [destroy] them selves with their own [explosive item]. Other things about how the AI reacts are erratic and break the illusion of competent enemies. However inconsistent the enemy AI is, your team's AI is worse. A lot worse. From getting stuck on doorways, grenading them selves, getting in your way, to just plain not paying attention and getting killed by a trigger happy bad guy. For some reason they all use full automatic with whatever gun you assign them. It's terrible to see your team fire off rounds and simply not hit anything. Nor can they slowly open doors. They just fling them wide open for all the tangos to see and fill with lead. Much of the game I had to plan my assault based on what my team couldn't do very well rather than what they could. Since they [end life] so easy, and you can't replace them, you might have to reload a dozen times before you get it right. Still this is done with some good graphics. Character models are made with lots of polygons and great textures. Some of the faces look photo realistic. The environments are richly detailed, even if you are indoor most of the game. Little things like footprints, steam from pipes (or bullet holes in pipes), detailed shadows, reflections in car windows, animated tree limbs and seeing the breath of your teammates on winter maps all paint a realistic feeling world. Oddly it seems that with the newest 3D engine they could have pushed it further. 3rd person [firearms] could use some more polygons, the sky is a simple skybox, nor are shadows as good as in Splinter Cell. One area that has really been improved is multiplayer. No longer are you bothered to log in to MSN to play. The game comes with an in-game search and browse screen. Setting up filters makes it easy to find the kind of game you want. Of course if MP isn't your bag, there is a nice single player custom mission option too. Overall this is solid game that features a range of features and great action worth checking out for weeks.	1
As a huge fan of the Rainbow Six games, I was truly ecstatic to find out that a new installment was coming out. I was not disappointed. This game is awesome.   This new Rainbow Six vastly differs from the previous ones. It now is much more realistic in terms of how real counter-terrorism teams operate, the way the terrorists collapse after you kill them are much more realistic, there is a multitude of new guns, and on each you can put an attachment, making a lot of combinations possible, and the graphics in general are much, much better.   Although it is rather expensive with a $$ price tag, it is definitely worth every penny. For all of you FPS junkies out there, your collection is not complete until you get this one.	1
(breif review)... I'm a huge fan of the rainbow six series, and this latest release doesnt let me down. Nearly every aspect of the game is very well done and pollished..... the gfx, sound, gameplay, maps, weapons, and gadgets are all superb.... the UI and the AI arnt perfect, but they arnt poor either... nothing a patch cant fix. Bottom line is this is a *very* fun game to play online... i love it more than counter-strike... i would argue it has more depth and requires more stratigy. If you are a fan of online FirstPersonShooter games, then get this game.... you won't be disappointed.  - duck	1
I don't have time to write a full-page review so I will tell you about the game quickly.  The graphics are better then any Tom Clancy game I have ever played they are amazing.  There are 15 single player missions and a whole bunch of multiplayer ones.  You can have as many as eight soldiers on your team and as little as one.  You can customize every thing on them from their camo to their weapons to there gear and body armor.  Here are some of the weapons and items you can choose from PISTOLS -desert eagle .357cal -USP.40cal -Micro Uzi 9mm -TMP 9mm ASSAULT RIFLES -M4 5.56mm -FAMAS G2 5.56mm -AK-47 7.62mm -M16A2 5,56mm GRENADES -Smoke grenade -frag grenade -Tear Gas grenade -Flash Bang EQUIPMENT -Night vision goggles -Gas mask -Suppresser -IR scope This is just a small amount of the weapons and equipment available to you.  Your team is very smart and without your team you will fail.  Your team can do a wide variety of things: they can snipe, go on recon, defuse bombs, open and clear rooms and they can follow waypoints.  The terrorists are very smart too, so you'd better be up to the challenge.  THIS IS THE BEST TACTICAL SHOOTER EVER, EVEN RAINBOW SIX HATERS WILL LIKE THIS GAME.	1
This is a great game. It's a wonderful real-time strategy game, which is what it claims to be. Hegemonia is not an empire-builder, and it never claims to be. The interface is not very intuitive. That is to say, it does not work like other games in the same genre, or 3d games in general. If you look at the manual, though, where they explain moving the camera, it suddenly makes sense. I can move my fleets or my camera wherever I would like, effortlessly. Visually, the game is absolutely stunning. Watching the battles are like watching Babylon 5, in real-time, on your PC. Wonderful particle effects, location-specific damage, and the most beautiful explosions you've seen on your PC to date make it really difficult to decide whether to watch a battle up-close and personal or back up to see the whole panoramic view. Each is equally impressive. The camera is always smooth, zooming and panning to your destination. The only time there is a hard cut is when you switch solar systems. Their system of multiple solar systems divided by static jump points is a great way of providing different fronts for your battles, and being able to decide what planets to colonize and what static and mobile defenses to build. What I think is best of all is that this game is simple. There isn't a huge involvement in learning to play the game, and it's not so simple that, once you know how to move your ships around, you can just jump in a start playing. Everything fits together to make the game not only a fun real-time strat, but a full multimedia experience. I've had a remarkable time playing the game in the first two weeks I've owned it, and I look forward to a long time replaying it at higher skill levels.	1
Bought the game March 15, 2003. Out of the box it was patch level 1.05. Appeared at first to run fine on Windows XP Home Edition on high end machine with nVidia graphics card. But I could not move the ships nor do much of anything else, at least not very often and not very consistently. It appeared to be an expensive screen saver. Thought the problem was me. But after six hours of pure frustration I finally realized the game simply was not working properly and decided to look for help. Discovered there is a patch 1.07 that seems to have cured my problems. This is a large patch, 17.9 MB download. The descriptor for this patch at the Hegemonia web site says that installation of patch 1.07 will allow both mouse buttons to work, and my experience with the game out of the box was that the right mouse button was simply not doing anything at all most of the time. If running the game on Windows XP, the Hegemonia web site support info says that an alternative fix might be to try running it in an emulation mode for Windows 98 or ME. I note that DreamCatcher does not list Hegemonia in its list of XP compatible games. Caveat emptor. Five stars for graphics alone. One reviewer said it did not have a starmap, but it does! Just hit the spacebar to toggle it on and off. This is a complex game and you will discover the manual is not in there just to make the box weigh more. You will need to know what the keyboard commands do to make it work. While on the Hegemonia web site pick up a copy of the campaign walkthru, a .pdf file that has printing locked out, so you will have to download the walkthru .pdf file for offline consultation, which you will feel the need of sooner rather than later. This game has gotten excellent reviews from the professional reviewers at the major gaming web sites.	1
This game is good because of 2 main reasons, unlike other shooters it has 3rd person view(you can see behind player) and it also has amazing levels. Heres my scale. Gameplay = 7/10 Graphics = 8/10 Sound = 10/10 Value = 7/10 Tilt = 10/10 Have fun!=)	1
Iron Storm is probably one of the most gross games I have ever played but also one of the most fun. The fact that when you toss a grenade at someone they blow up and thier limbs go flying splattering blood everywhere. I know war is terrible but this is just unreal. If your squimish this is not the game for you. I've also noticed in the first level if you shoot one of the soldiers they fire back and try and kill you but, if you kill the nurse or the cheifs no one cares, weird. The game has a lot of pluses too, for instance the guns abosisly have been made from a junk yard do to lack of resorces and all of the weapons are farely crude(Awsome). Another cool factor in the game is that you can sneek up on an enemy and kill them with your sabre with one hit. Bening in the treches most of the game is pretty scary when your first playing it, you could die just around the corner. The towns look fantastic graphic wise. AI is sort of a bust, for instance I was out of ammo and I just walked around the bad guy and killed him with my sabre. Other than that the game is lots of fun if your in to half-life and Quake kinds of games.	1
Ok Mario Party is fun.....! But i think that a 4 is not good. Mario Party one was very good, two was ok and 3 was sooo boring and just the same again. I know everybody is going to say oh, but this one is diferent is for NGC, but is always the same. So if you already have one mario party that will do, but if you don't hava anyone but the 4 for the NGC......	-1
Hey before I sat anything i'd Like to say Gamecube kills Xbox. Anyway I have came to hate and love the mario party series. Now for you at home If there's more than one person playing it's pretty cool. But the fact That A single round is about an hour! Hey This game is good to rent but not to buy. It includes 50 mini games, And plany of boardes. YEAH BOARDES this is just Video game impression of a board game with mario. I'm not saying it's horrible but you'll be bored in 1 week. (So rent it)	1
It came in perfect condition and it was great to play it. It reminds me back when I was a kid again.	1
My kids love this.	1
This game I got for my son and it was hard for him to figure out and also me to help try to figure out how to play, a little difficult to strategize.	1
Game works, and my son enjoys it!! That's what I was shooting for. The game could have been in better shape though.	1
Very fun this Mario party is my favorite and came when expected!	1
Great Product! Loved it.	1

These have been opened then sealed by third party not from manufacturer.	-1
Great Product	1
My son  loves it!	1
This Mario party has a focus on mega and mini mushrooms. Great game and I enjoy it a lot. Worked greatly.	1
Was in good shape and works geat!	1
With so many mario party games out its hard to tell them apart. This one stood out as being the first one on gamecube. With the similar gameplay as the rest it is easy to jump right into a game. And with the new save mode you can continue your game at your chosing!	1
It works great! I absolutely love this game and I wouldnt trade it for anything. It works very well and it is a very enjoyable game.	1
I can not say enough about the Mario party games. We have played them all except 1. These games are games inside of games. You can select many of your favorite characters from Mario games. I like Yoshi and always will,but most like DK. Each of the Mario Party games is a step up from the last 1 and new twists and games. You can play in a few different worlds of each character and there are different modes to choose from which allow to unlock different things. We played these games for hours and hours and even held tournaments with them. On a scale from 1-10 I give Mario Party 4 an 8. Overall these games are the best ever.	1
One of the great gamecube games. Fun with a group. Kind of boring on your own. I like the layout of the boards in this version.	1
This game is a very fun board-game-like video game that is great to play with friends or at small parties. You don't even have to be a gamer to enjoy this game, and it is easy to play.	1
My personal favorite Mario Party game and an essential to any Gamecube library. The minigames are pretty varied and fun and the boards are interesting ^^	1
I really enjoyed this game. However I personally didn't enjoy as much as mario party 6(played that first) Still a must own for Mario Party fans.	1
This game is amazing I only payed $15.00 for it though I had to pay $10.00 for the manuel since when I bought the game it didn't have a manuel. For my personal collection I always have the following requirements when it comes to buying Gamecube games: 1.) Original Nintendo Case,  2.)  Original Advertising Art Cover, 3.) Manuel and  4.) Disc.  I am not the kind of person who only collects the disc. Besides these games are hard to find and I value a game if has all my above requirements as a collector. As far as the game I love it and it speaks for itself. Its got great graphics and is a lot of fun and for the whole family.	1
This is not as good as the first but the boards are fun and the shop is basic. The story mode is similar to the the main game and the extra sections are not needed. This is like N64 gameplay and MP5 is Gamecube gameplay. This is a very basic game and is fun for the whole family. This is a good title to start getting into gaming. MP5 is the best on the system and 6 and 7 are rentals.	1
There are some really fun minigames in this game like "Booksquirm", but there is also a load of boring 3-1 games, I didn't really like ANY of them.  The graphics are very pretty, the water effects in one of the minigames is beautiful.  There's also a lottery where you can win muschrooms or money.  Bowser Minigames are fun, a bit long, but I love the humor in "Fruits of Doom".  "Dee-lish!"  My only complaint about this game is how SLOW the characters move on the board, it's like watching them walk in slow-motion, it sadly takes up most of the time you are playing.	1
This Mario Party has the best mini-games of any of the Mario Party's and I definately recommend buying this one before some of the others.	1
This is the first Mario Party game I played and it is the best of the series.  It's simple and straight forward.  The mini-games make a great break to the board game portion.  This game is intuitive enough for my 4 year old to play along too.  Some of the mini-games are sometimes a little too advanced for him, but he still has fun trying.  This game is a great way to keep the family together during rainy days when we can't play outside.  Playing by yourself?  Thats ok.  The single player modes will keep you busy trying to beat all of the games with all of the characters so you can receive all of your "birthday presents".  This game would make a great gift for anyone!	1
I reccomend this game for those who like to parr-tay! This is a wonderful mix of colorful characters, unique gameboards, different(but good of course) gameplay, and best of all it has everyones favorite plumber taking the spotlight. Of course Bowser is up to no good, and takes on his usual delightful role of a tantrum throwing, mario hating, princess stealing, dragon. This time he's back with lots of rage, i mean a therepist would have a fieldday with this guy. He of course had his own gameboard which is hillarios, it's owned by he and his equally funny and menacing son, baby bowser (or sometimes called Koopa Kid). I loved this game though it is aimed at a younger audience, but the multiplayer mode will bring delight to anyone regardless of age. This game is a gem in a pool of second-rate gamecube games, a must have for any real gamer. 5 out of 5 stars, most definatly.	1
This is an OKAY MP game. There are better ones... ( the N64 ones ) But anyways, this is the first Cube game I ever got, I actually got it before I got my Cube. It was a very fun game, it added a lot of stuff never before seen in the series, but they added so much, it kinda took out a bit of the fun with it. There are fun maps, more characters to play with, more minigames ( not neccesarily better ) and of course, sharper graphics. I still reccomend the N64 mario partys, but this is still a party game you should not pass up.	1
There are just so many delightful game Nintendo has been able to create for one of the most successful game systems ever, the Gamecube. Arguably, to create a smash game that was brought up from the Nintendo 64 era is quite amazing. That has happened with the successful Mario Party franchise from the N64 era. It was one of the surprising games ever developed back in the 90's. To do it again for the Gamecube was quite a surprise. While so many additions have been added, the Gamecube debut was very well put. It just added on so much from before, nothing but the roll of the dice was missed.  Mario Party 4 for the Nintendo Gamecube, the Gamecube debut consists of so many outrageous boards, and games to uncover. The game also adds some new details including a tougher story mode, and a whole bunch of new features, new boards like Bowser's Party, new mini, and mega mushrooms, and 50 great mini-games to unlock, such as Mario Speedwagon. The graphics look much better than they did for the N64, and the gameplay has improved nicely. Yet, with all the hype, there are a few disadvantages the game has. One of them is the games take a little longer to load up, unlike the N64 versions which were a instant. Another disadvantage is that it might not seem as challenging for Gamecube players, as much as Mario Party veterans have matched before.  Still, Mario Party 4 makes a great virtual board game feel for anybody who wants to roll those dice on the Gamecube. While you can right now only find this game used, it is still a great purchase for anybody wants to play. It doesn't add up solo, but if you're playing with others, it is a real party to match.  Graphics: B+  Sound: B-  Control: A-  Fun & Enjoyment: B if you are playing solo; B+ if you're playing against someone  Overall: B 1/2+	1
I love every Mario game known to man and this one rocks!!!! (I  actually don't like Mario Party 6 but that's it)!!! I played this game 2 summers ago all the time!!! This is a good game and it has really good graphics. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!	1
This game just arrived the other night ' i played it and i noticed it has a opening cinema but MP5 did not ' so after going to story mode i was realize this game is more better then MP5 because you don't half to complete against those annoying koopa kids :)  But some mini games are still hard like on MP5 and story mode reminds me of Party mode on MP4 ' this game is so much fun you can also have fun playing with the game with your friends  Pros  Opening Cinema  Cool Music and voice acting  Nice board game levels  Cons  Some Mini games are hard making it kinda impossible to be party star in the game  Overall its still a fun game ' so buy this game you won't regret it :)	1
Mario party 4 just has some more games than the other partys.	1
The reason I think mario party 4 is better then 5 is because a couple of reasons... 1. The mini games are better! 2. The boards don't go in circles and have better spaces! 3. There is a store so you can actully get what you want. 4. The mini game rooms kick[!] 5. I'm not absoulotly positive but I think the graphics are a little better in number 4! Deffently a better purchase.	1
Mario Party 4 is a worthy addition to the Mario Part series. The graphics are worlds better than the blocky N64 graphics of old. On top of that, there are tons of brand new mini-games, and that is really what the series is about. First of all, I disliked Mario Party 3. I thought that Nintendo had had too much stuff going on, which dragged the game out for much longer than necessary. Mario Party 4 goes back to a much less crowded design and while there are many things that you can do while on the board, it doesn't seem to derail the game as much. Even so, the game still seems to play a little slowly. You may find yourself tapping your feet as everybody else does their turn and before you get into a mini-game. Even on the shortest game length setting the game can be a little tedious. The mini-games are really good. There is a good selection of games where speed is needed, where skill is needed, and where cooperation is needed. You will probably not get many repeat mini-games during your game, but even if you do, you likely won't mind. They are pretty darn fun. This game really is fun, even if you don't have three other humans to play against. Even playing against the computer is fun (if somewhat slow). Different enough to warrant buying even if you have the N64 ones (like I do). Very fun, and a must for anybody seeking a good multiplayer Gamecube game.	1
I love this game!  I had so much fun playing with my kids.  It's like a board game with a lot of interesting challenges and it's just plain good fun.  The game is simple enough and you don't need to commit a whole lot of time to play.  You can learn it as you go.  Unlike other Game Cube games, this one did not make me dizzy.  Playing Mario Party 4 is like being in an amusement park.	1
I may have only played this game twice at my house but it is great! And that was my first time playing a Mario Party game. I'll tell you what  My favorute mini game game is and about. It is calleed Book squirm. You are in a book and there is holes in the book so go in the holes or uou will get squirmed. I mean squshed So if you have game cube buy this game!	1
This was a great game.  I loved all the Mario Party games that came out, as do my friends.  It's great for when you have friends over.  It's fun, cute, and addicting.  I love all the characters like Yoshi and Peach.  The graphics are amazing.  It's really a step up from the previously-loved Mario Party games.	1
Mario Party 4 is the 4th installment of the popular series.  You play on a board like a real boardgame and you got to roll the dice.  You win the game when you collect enough stars.  Collecting Stars will cost you 20 coins  (or no coins at all if you find a star in a hidden box).   I have been a fan of the Mario Party series ever since I played Mario Party 2.  Four people can play in this fun game!	1
I have played every single game in the Mario series, and I would say, even though GC is better, the orignals on N64 were the best. I just find the third the best out of all of them. Mario Party is only good if you have friends to play it with. Some, may say it's good to play alone too, but with more people, your having lots of fun competing. So, the main overall thing is, if you have all the Mario Party's, and you want to get this one, then go get it. But, if your just getting into the saga, then, I would rent this one.	1
I just brought the gamecube back in May of 2003 and along with it, i got Mario Party 4. I tried the game and i immediately fell in love with it. I played it till the end and enjoyed it. The graphics were great (5 of 5), the music was also great (5 of 5). but the controls weren't that good. Just two weeks ago, while playing the mini-game domination (the worst mini-game)i suffered a blister which i still have. Also, the the game had a slow loading time and the game overall was slow. It takes one hour to beat one board. However, i heard that Nintendo corrected these mistakes in  Mario Party 5 (new mini-games, more expanded roles for toad, boo, goomba, koopa troopa, and bowser kid, and new boards). Just a few days ago, i read all the reviews for the Mario Party series and found that many people complained about the one-player mode claiming that's weak. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME AND SAY THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT ARE CRAZY. THE ONE-PLAYER MODE IS OK. I MEAN SOMETIMES TWISTS AND TURNS TAKE PLACE AND I (AN EXPERT) GET BEATEN. THE COMPUTER IS MOST OF THE TIME COMPETITIVE AND GREAT. HOWEVER I HAVE ONE SISTER AND SHE DOESN'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES THAT MUCH SO THE ONE-PLAYER MODE  I FOUND IS BETTER THAN MULTI-PLAYER MODE, ESPEACIALLY BEACH VOLLEYBALL. SO MY POINT IS THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE ONE-PLAYER MODE IS WEAK SHOULD GO TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL AND GET THEMSELVES RE-EVALUATED.	1
I find this game to be pretty boring (3 stars). I hate waiting through other character's turns. dull. BUT...After beating the parties, you're reward an awesome extra game in the extra-game room. It's beach volleyball and it is a blast! (5 stars- thus, an average of 4-(even though I hate having to rechoose all the info after losing- it needs a replay option) Anyway, the beach volleyball is the best part of this game.	1
This game was addictive to me for a while, but it got real old FAST.  The storyline is stupid, I mean really, who wants to work their back off trying to get presents for YOUR birthday?!  Also, the game way too easy, and the game is a repeat of Mario Party 3.  No new character and character voices, it's once again just a bunch of annoying squeaking animals.  In addition, there are only 6 boards in total, and they are so plain.  This game seriously needs to take advantage of the Gamecube features.  Apparently, Hudson and Nintendo are still living in the Nintendo 64 era.  The only thing OK about the game is the graphics.  Beside that, it's a waste of money.  Don't get it, I warn you, you'll want your money back very soon after purchase!  You can also see my review on Mario Party 5 if you visit that page.	-1
I'm sick of mario party titles.  The first one was fun, the second one was weak, but still good, and from there on the series hit rock bottom and dragged it's way across it.  It may entertain someone who's never played the series, but everyone else will be dead sick of it.  Mario party should have stayed Mario Party, and there shouldn't have been any sequels.  Obviously Nintendo's in this franchise for the money and only the money.	-1
Its a great multiplayer game for the very young or very old.  The game consists of a board game (like the previous Mario party titles) and lots of mini games.  Most of the mini games consist of button mashing or running but they are amusing.  It might be a little too easy for the hard core gamer but it will hold your interest. It is much more fun when playing with a group of friends since the solo game can become long and drawn out.  One game board can take you 40 minutes to an hour when playing a short game.  It is a great game to have in your collection if you have little children that want to join in while you play.  The graphics are crisp with bright colors and great sound.  Kids will enjoy it for the (usually) simplified gameplay and comical characters.	1
Another classic from nintendo.  yeah it's basicly just an nintendo 64 update with a facelift, but that doesn't take awy from the fun.  A great game for a group of friends when you are tired of playing goldeneye or halo.  Yet another reason nintendo is still the best company going	1
This is a great game cause you can play against CPUs as well as humans. There are great visuals and its as much fun as Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2. However, this isn't as good as Super Smash Bros and the sequel Super Smash Bros Melee. Smash Bros is a straightforward brawler with excellent music and fast paced action and tons of options. This has options but only 5 of them are really fun. But I got to hand it to the visual department cause this game really kicks some [hiney] And Whomp from Super Mario 64 is in this game! Buy this game if you want to be in on the best of Nintendo.	1
#4!?!?!? How great is this game? IT'S ALMOST PERFECT! I love it sooooooooooooo much it can't stop to talk about it unless I feel like not playing it! There's 1 must-own PARTY GAME AND THIS IS IT!	1
My almost-5-year-old loves this game. He got 5 different games with his Xmas GameCube and this is the one he comes back to and plays with the longest. I know some reviewers said it's not a great game for 1 player, but trust me, if you are younger like my son, and an only child to boot, it's GREAT fun to have the computer play the other 3 characters. He cheers for his computer partner whenever he or she wins a challenge. But mom enjoys it too, and my son and I played for 3 hours straight one day. A great investment for families who want to get games that EVERYONE can play.	1
Mario Party 4 is awesome. Well, in multiplayer, when you have 3 friends to play it with. Single player, it..., because as the other guy said, it's pretty annoying watching the cpu's play their turns, and it gets boring pretty fast to just know you do it so you can unlock extra levels and stuff. I still give it a 5/5 because it has great graphics, gameplay, and replay value when playing with friends. Luckily I have two sisters to play it with, and who like it a lot.	1
This was a great recovery from the terrible Mario Party 3!  I"m so glad they took out that stupid Die thing and that evil star.  They brought the charcters back to normal and now playing lots of crazy mini games.  I like this game because of the characters reactions and boards.  This game is fun with other people so join up with friends and play!	1
Well what did we expect from the latest Mario Party game. There are many other games that tried to imitate these series' successful achievement of delivering an accessible fun and simple 4 player game has failed and this latest addition effortlessly beats the rest of the competition. Well technically it doesn't look very good at all by today's standards and sounds quite annoying but those points are quite irrelevant because this game is simply about multiplayer mayhem. Alone this game is OK but is so much better when there is 2-4 of you playing. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good multiplayer game which doesn't require so much skill but which still provides great entertainment for any kind of gamer. Graphics:6 Sound:5 Gameplay-1 PLayer:8 Multiplayer:10 Value:10	1
This game continues where the 3 previous ones left off. This game seems easier to play, and has a high replay value. There is a mode in which the players compete through a series of the "game boards" to gather "presents" to add to a display in a certain part of game. I have not gathered them all yet, as I have only had the game a few weeks. To players of the previous games--Slot Car racing is gone! If you're like me, that is a good thing. There's also none of the "rotate the stick" games that produced many blisters. The game is suitable for all ages, and it is easy enough to pick up on that it may replace Scrabble on borad game night!	1
Mario Party 4 doesn't need two-colored semi-transparent spheres to have a great time. As far as minigames go, Mario squashes the Monkeys with about ten times as many minigames, and better ones, for that matter. As for the board game, it can get sort of dull at times, and the "Mini-Mega" system doesn't  help either, but it does provide a nice strategic twist. I bought both Monkey Ball games at the same time, because I heard they had tons of great minigames. Well, they don't, (Except for Monkey Fight in Super Monkey Ball 1) and Mario Party 4 comes out way on top. If you want good party games, buy Super Smash Bros. Melee, buy Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, and buy this game, but beware the monkeys. (P.S.: I actually wanted to give this game 4.5 stars, but there's no option for that.)	1
The kid loves it, like all of his other Mario games.	1
Ah, finally Mario party is back, and all freshened up and new for the game cube. But what really makes this any better than the previous games in the series? Some would agree that a game gets old by the 4th sequel if it's still the same generally gameplay, but I'm not one of those people. In my opinion, Mario Party 4 is new in many ways. For one thing it has a great assortment of new and creative mini games, all of witch are fun and different. Also it has a lot of cool features like large and small mushrooms, (Large allow you to trample you opponents for coins, wile small allows you to gain access to special paths.) While I have not yet played it I have played the prequels, therefore having a feel for the generally gameplay. And after reading many reviews and watching many gameplay movies I can get a good feel of how this game will be. If you are a fan of Mario party I would defiantly suggest this game. If you have a few friends over one night, I would suggest you at least rent it and give it a try. Overall, I believe this game will be quite good, and a great asset at small parties. My overall rating of the game would be an 8.5 I hope my review was helpful.	1
Generally speaking, a good party consists of loud music, obnoxious people you don't really know, copious amounts of cheap vodka, and a few loose women. While Nintendo's Mario Party 4 doesn't rely on any of the above, it does provide a digital alternative to raging hangovers and vague memories of the previous night's activities. Although it's the fourth title in the series, it's the first Mario Party game on the GameCube, and it packs a decent four-player punch. Mario Party 4 goes a little above and beyond its previous incarnations, and thanks to some skillful development from Hudson Soft, eight of your favorite Nintendo characters are ready to do battle through over 50 nutty mini-games in order to win a juicy prize. Lending itself to a very simple gameplay premise, Mario Party 4 is best enjoyed with four human players -- the idea is to be guy that collects the most hidden stars and gold coins at the end of a party. Each party is played over a selectable number of turns (from between ten and 50 -- ten turns takes around 30 minutes to play) on one of five themed game boards. Some familiar faces are on hand to meet and greet the party-players. Toad, Shy Guy, Koopa, Boo, and Goomba all offer a game board with themes such as the "Seaside Soiree," the "Haunted Bash," and the "Jungle Jam." There are eight Nintendo-friendly guys and gals to choose from at the player select screen: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Daisy, and Waluigi. There are essentially two main modes of play in Mario Party 4. Party mode is where the most fun occurs and involves between one to four human players getting jiggy on any of the game boards. Story mode is the single-player component of the game and pits you against three randomly selected CPU-controlled guys. If you win the game, you'll be awarded a prize, and depending on which character you were playing as, it'll be different each time (e.g. Playing as Waluigi, I won Waluigi's Shelf, which is one of many unique pieces of furniture that can be found for his mini-apartment -- viewable in the prize room). One new feature to the series is the mini-mega system -- which manifests itself in the form of two different mushroom-based items. These items can be taken before you roll the die at the beginning of turn. A mini-mushroom will shrink you down, allowing you to access other areas of the board, but it'll limit your maximum die roll to five instead of six. Being mini will allow you to tackle some special "mini" mini-games too. Going the other route and taking a mega-mushroom, will in contrast increase the size of your guy, and it'll give you a combined roll of two dice, increasing your ability to travel further around the board. You'll also squish any players that you travel past, causing them to hemorrhage value gold coins. Being large also means you'll be immune to any event spaces on the board. The mini-mega system is cool in theory, but in actuality, it doesn't really add that much to the gameplay. There are a ton of new items, events, traps, and bonuses that are scattered through the game -- such as the Genie Lamp which costs 30 coins to buy -- but it'll warp you straight to the current star on the board. All these factors throw more uncertainty into the mix, with the final game experience getting more and more random compared to the first three games in the series. Is this a bad thing? It depends on your point of view, but it can be pretty frustrating to be on top for most of the game and then have it all snatched away at the last minute. There are a few constants; these arrive at the very end of the game in the form of stars awarded to the player that collected the most coins, won the most mini-games, and triggered the most event features. There's no doubt that Mario Party 4 sports classic multiplayer fun and all of the mini-games are a blast in their own right, but there's one hugely annoying factor -- the CPU controlled characters. In the single-player mode, you'll be forced to watch the CPU guys take their individual turns. This happens at a mind-numbingly slow pace, and after a few games you'll be begging to have bamboo shoots inserted under your fingernails to alleviate the tedium. Essentially, the single-player game exists to let you win the prizes -- something that becomes very unimportant all too quickly. Huge Mario gets ready to squash the others. Putting those issues aside, Mario Party 4 as an actual party game, works really well. Teamwork, smack talk, and cajoling come heavily into play, and it's certainly the best in the series to date. The GameCube provides the graphical grunt to take Mario Party 4 to the next level and all of the characters, boards, and mini-games display slick animation, special effects, and a sweet bouncy-cartoony look and feel. Controls for the most part are extremely simplistic, but this really only adds to the pick-up-and-play nature of the game as a whole. There's a myriad of nice Nintendo-tastic tunes, voices, and sound effects, which wrap the game up into a well-presented, good-looking game. For those that enjoy Nintendo's rich characters and imagination, Mario Party 4 is a great game to have. With four-players in tow, it's a total blast, but for those that are looking for some solid, non-anger-inducing solo play, you'd do well to swerve away from this one for sure. The Lowdown: More of the same great Mario Party multiplayer action. Pros: It looks great; the mini-games are a hoot; really good fun with four players. Cons: More features aren't necessarily a good thing; there's little fun when flying solo. BIG DAN's OVERALL RATING - 7.5/10	1
Stronghold: Crusader, the follow up to Stronghold, does a good job fixing things that did not make sense in the first game, and bringing a whole new look to the second version.  The idea for battling in new terrain is excellent.  The challenge is to fight for every spare inch of irrigated land for your food, without it you are dead.  The new units such as Arabian Horsemen and Fire-Throwers are excellent.  One pick with this game is why is there no level selection?  You can only play on one level, and on the first version you could choose between many different levels of difficulty.  Also, there should be an easier way to look at the entire playing field instead of just being able to turn on 90 degree angles for viewing.  But overall, this game is done well and you will be playing for hours.  Almost a perfect comination castle simulation and city/economy simulation.  B+ Joseph Dworak	1
When I installed the demo, I thought this will be just another one of those boring strategy games. But I was 100% wrong... This game is simply amazing to the highest degrees. And extremely fun and DANGEROUSLY addicting and time consuming. I know that the full version will have more features, but still the demo is awesome. You only have 3 options in the demo: Very Easy, Easy, and hard. It took me a whole week to beat all 3 difficulty levels. Richard the Lionheart was the most difficult to fight. It has features from Caesar II (the fire and mini video clips) and from Pharoah (tax control)... It has a variety of characters, things to build, events, unexpected enemies, and a whole lot of new stuff that does not appear in any other RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game... Enjoy...	1
I liked Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends was OK but this game is just so outdated and the graphics stank so much I could only play it twice before I never looked at it again.	-1
For an expansion this game is a must have if you liked the original Stronghold. There was A LOT more game play in this expansion than I thought there would be. On the down side the campaign has no real plot but it was still fun to play. I am glad I bought it.	1
I am very particular about the games I buy, This is without a doubt the best stradegy game I've ever played. This game is not only good , but will keep you entertained for guite a while because there are so many options to choose from. I agree with some of the other reviewers, I played this game for 8 hours, never got bored,because the time just seemed to past by, highly addictive. This game just keeps you so in to it, you don't want to stop , just remember there are 4 main objectives, to getting you going in this game,taxes,food protection, and religion. Make sure your popularity stay above 70 until you get your castle established pretty well. I kept the tax level to no taxes, until I got every thing going to my advantage, then you can go up to above mean taxes if you wish. Try this game out , I seriously don't think you will be disappointed.	1
I recall having already written a review for this, but I can't see it here ;) This is a top-notch game. I've played through the original Stronghold twice, and I always had two problems with it: 1) Not enough missions from start to finish 2) Levels too short. I found that often I'd be just getting going on my castle and then the time would end! This solves both. The campaign mode on this has 4-5 5 mission mini-campaigns. The reason I'm not positive on the 4-5 is because frankly these are just kind of filler to teach you about new units and what not. Also ridiculously easy (I quit half way through the second or third campaign). But that's my only gripe. The meat of this game is a 50 back-to-back mission super-campaign. There is no storyline to these, and they are just different missions done sequentially (you see a guy on a map as he progresses along). I'm on mission 30 now. I found that the first 20 were overall fairly easy, but they've started to get harder, and promise to be very challening by the end. These missions are your castle vs. one or several computer AIs each with their own. Sometimes you get an ally or two (they are quite incompetent at the beginning, but do become more useful later on). My interest in games in recent years has waned, but my wife is away this weekend and, other than eating infrequently, I've done little but play this game both days. I quite simply am not getting bored by it at all; it's like I'm 16 again and it's summer time. And look how cheap this game is now? Buy it!	1
This is the greatest game Ive ever played bar none.  When I was in highschool I loved Civilization 2.  I recently got a computer and wanted a good game.  I bought Civilization 3 and it seemed to have lost something.  I cant put my finger on it but it just didn't have the soul.  Or maybe I have changed and need more exitement.  Well anyway I took a chance on Stronghold Crusader and haven't stopped playing since.  This game is simply amazing.  You build up a castle(kind of like sim city).  You have to build houses for the people and cathedrals.  The graphics are simply beautiful.  The battles are very INTENSE.  And strategy changes on each skirmish.  What worked in one, dosent get you anywhere in another.  This game has the soul I was talking about earlier.  I really feel angered when my castle is getting burned down.  I take it personal.  How many games emmerse you to the extent that you get so involved in the game.  I haven't ever taken a game so much to heart.  Take a chace on this one.  Its not very expensive and has kept me at it for many days.  Very addictive.  And the thrill of beating a lord who has been given you a hard time.  That thrill of victory is priceless.  Go out and buy this game.  NOW!	1
Endless hours of gameplay is all I have to say. I have yet to tire of this game. You have to be concerned with all of the micro-management of the original Stronghold. You're opponents are more challenging. One aspect of this game that is very challenging is that most areas are arid (desert) regions, so finding areas to grow food can be difficult. Don't worry, that's what makes it more fun. Resources are scarce and enemies are plentiful and vicious. The Wolf, the Rat, the Pig, and the Snake are all back, along with a few new characters to get on your nerves, in a good way. For those who may have not played the original, you will want to buy this after you have played Stronghold, or you may be disappointed. You don't have to play the original to appreciate this game but it helps. For those who are new, the idea is simple: keep your people fed, protected, and happy, and they will serve you well. Build an army, make sure there is enough money in the treasury, keep an eye on your rations, maintain sufficient resources on your stockpile, stock your armory with weapons, and eliminate your enemy. It is a wonderful real-time war game, that requires you to focus on more than war. The regular one-player story mode has about 50 missions, so it will take you a while to complete that aspect. All of the other modes will keep you occupied if you get bored with that, and if you are totally bored, create your own maps and scenarios. I use the term bored losely because it is almost impossible to do with this game.	1
Fans of the original Stronghold already know that this series offers real time strategy as you build a booming economy and crush your foes with Medieval troops.  Well, this is the same thing...only more so.  Perhaps the most important addition is the Mercenary Post, where you can purchase the services of Arabian troops to augment your Crusader forces.  This sequel is rare in the fact that while it has advanced greatly, it has also lost nothing in the process.  I just wish I was as good at controlling troops as I am at building economies....Buy this game.  Do it!  Do it now!	1
I luckily found one of these pedals wheel and all the bits and pieces at a thrift store so i aquired it very cheap needless to say this is by far one of the most solid racing wheels I've used and it works on my windows 10 and with dozens or my steam racing games. I had some issues which forced my to dwindle in options but once complete i had zero issues. I got mine for 20 bucks lucky me but id have been willing to shell out the 80 most would want for it. I has flappy shifter and a slap stick style s***er and the tension give weight to the wheel while racing. I have yet to pla a game that rips the wheel from your hands but ill find one. Anyways Id buy it though at this point its 9 years old so Im sure theres a update out there. With care im sure this wheel will last forever oh and it doesnt require a driver to work sweet pickin	1
love it	1
nice	1
Works great for many years on many driving games on the computer. Just to bad it has no software drivers for any computer that runs Windows Vista or newer....... Did pass it on to a Windows XP user who still uses it today in the Year 2014.	1
Have used it regularly for 3 years and it always works flawlessly. Totally awesome wheel and pedal set that has no comparison, in it's price range. They don't make it any more.	1
I've had my Logitech MOMO for about four years now and just in the past year its started feeling like an old wheel. So it's pretty durable and I would say it was worth the $70 I paid for it. The force feedback is great and has always helped me get a feel for the track (it's particularly helpful in simulations like iRacing). Overall the wheel has a nice feel to it and it's adapted well to the multiple PC games I play.  The pedals are decent. Unfortunately after only about a year of use both pedals felt much looser, and the brake pedal would squeak so badly that I was afraid it would snap on me (which is what happened with my Logitech Wingman). The pedals leave a bit to be desired, but with that being said they've held their own over four years.  The biggest issue I had with the MOMO is the clamps for the wheel. When I got the wheel I had no idea that there were two clamps hidden under a plastic cover. So for the longest time I attempted to use the wheel with one clamp, and needless to say, I went through a lot of trouble getting the wheel to clamp to any surface. I guess not knowing those clamps were there is partially my fault, but I'm disappointed that Logitech didn't make those clamps more obvious. I didn't even have documentation that notified me of the two hidden clamps.  Overall I'd say the Logitech MOMO is worth purchasing. It has its issues, but the wheel up is the $300 G27, so if you're not willing to spend that much this is a good alternative. Based on its performance I'd say over $100 is a little pricey, but if you can find it for cheaper I'd recommend it!	1
I bought one of these several years ago and I loved it so much.  Then the right paddle shifter broke and I stopped using it.  I wasn't willing to shell out another 130 bucks or whatever it cost me.  I did get lots of use out of it, but I was hoping it would last me more than a few months.  I really want another one, but I just can't justify spending so much money on something that might break in a few months.  I can't even play racing games without a wheel.  Once you have, you can never go back to the keyboard or ps3 controller.	1
This wheel arrived from amazon.com well packed.  I mean, triple-boxed (including the retail box) and seemed in fine shape.  Unfortunately, the force-feedback would fail rather quickly.  Before that happened however I was able to use it and felt it was well worth the cost.  Game took on a whole new dimension with this device.  I played everything from GT Legends & GTR 2 to the Flatout game 2 & 3.  The wheel performed beautifully.  It has a great feel.  Only negative I can think of is the lack of a clutch peddle.  I missed that aspect of it and take off a whole star because of that.  How expensive is a third peddle?  Come on Logitech!  Still, I can't recommend this enough.  Now, after contacting Logitech about the problem I was having they told me to send it back.  And amazon.com provided a refund that was quick and easy.  That's why I like shopping here for online stuff because if you have a problem they will make exchange/refund simple.  I ended up buying a G25 from one of amazon.com's marketplace sellers, tigerdirect.  I'll review it at its listing later because the experience left something to be desired.  The product itself is outstanding even for the price, but tigerdirect's shipping methods are far below amazon.coms.  Spend the extra money with amazon.com if you want to make sure your product is taken care of.  Use tigerdirect if you need it cheaper...but remember, the G25 is probably the most expensive PC device you will buy and tigerdirect will treat it like a crate of gourds.	1
Its a nice wheel IMO, however there are a few things that annoyed me about it.  1. Documentation is limited and for the c clamps it doesn't say how to remove the gray cover.. 2. It has a built in lap "holder" which can be an issue for people with shorter desks 3. It makes a whining sound when turned quickly. (I was able to fix this with custom made gearing.) 4. The rubber is sticky. but after some use it will go away. 5. LED's are a bit bright and kinda blind/annoy you at night. 6. Paddle shifters feel awkward, they're a bit too far back. 7. Shifter(paddle shifters too) makes a loud clicky sound 8. "Sensitivity" doesn't seem to want to work properly with certain games (mainly DiRT and GRiD) its either full gas/brake/left/right or no gas/brake/left/right.(more than likely a game issue not product) 9. A bit too long, a bit longer and it would knock my monitor off the back of my desk.  Otherwise its a good wheel and I'd buy one again	1
Very good sensibility , I don't use much but I liked very much. Only problem is that it's incompatible with PS2 game console... need other wheel to it. :-\	1
Got this wheel for Christmas after doing quite a bit of research.  Previously had a Thrustmaster wheel which worked great and lasted forever but was for Windows 95 and was not FFB so I needed to upgrade.  The Logitech  MOMO FFB Wheel is terrific - great value for the price.  It shipped immediately and I had it within a couple of days right before Christmas.  The wheel installed without a hitch and has worked perfectly ever since.  I am using it with GT Legends and GTR2 as well as NASCAR SimRacing.  Works fine in all three games.  I think the wheel is a great value.	1
I had the old red wingman formula force for 5+ years and it was great. never a lick of a problem in any way.  Ive looked at this momo for a long time thought it looked cool, was logitech and got one.  a disaster from the start. this thing is a testament to  " how cheap can we make this and get away with it" mentality.  first you MUST remove your keyboard tray. noway around that.  it has a single cheap plastic screw clamp in the center with no handle on it like the dual clamps with knobs of the formula force.  so after removing your keyboard tray and all that, go get a wrech to tighten this thing. you can never get it tight enough for it to not slip around on the desk, thats what happens because a single weak cheap center clamp creates a pivot point for the wheel unit.  it sits too high on the desk. the top of the wheel was just under my chin. I had to raise my monitor up almost 6 inches then the whole setup is weird, not a natural driving position.  the pedal base is cheap and lightweight, and pedals stiff.  it raises up under your heel when using the pedals, if you brake hard, the whole base picks up in the back and spins to the left because the pedal is on the left side of it.  it slides away from you even on good carpet if you even bump it with your foot. its terrible. I had to double-sided sticky tape it to my carperting and now cant move it. those little spikes on the front do nothing and pick up if you step on the front of the base and it slides away.  The wheels grinds and is stiff. if you turn left/right fast it resists and makes a 'whirring' bearing sound.  the plugs are both on the front and hit your monitor stand. you cannot disconnect one plug like the old red wheel and put it away, it always has that cord pernmanantly attached and makes it a hassle.  I broke the cheapo plastic screw clamp tightening it after only 3-4 remove/installs to the desk. less than two weeks.  its a pointed plastic screw with no knob for tightening. you cant get it tight by hand and i figured since they put a wrench hexagon shape to it, you are supposed to use a wrench so i did,  well its such cheap plastic and you have to get it so tight to prevent movement the wrench end broke off. now its stuck on my desk and im wondering if amazon will give me a refund broke.  Logitech tells me to order/buy another plastic screw.  and they admit the design is flawed. got to Logitech and read some of the many many horrid letters I and others have written concerning this wheel. I should have. Thats why the price has dropped so much here, but they're still 100+ in stores.  My highest recommendation to NOT BUY this product. I was their biggest fan believe me with my old red formula force, but this thing is junk. total junk not worth 5 bucks. youll be replacing clamp screws bi-weekly or more. Logitech admits its a bad design but does nothing except sell you more plastic clamp screws! lol.  and it grinds , its stiff, the base slips, you have to remove keyboard tray....just take a pass on this one, Im sending it back and buying a microsoft wheel locally.  I saw the old red formula forces for sale here- well worth the price those things are the best, this momo thing is the worst.	-1
Sure we would all like to have a BRD or TSW, but this is the best bang for the buck of any wheel out there.  Matches perfectly with all the current sims, including rFactor (a MUST have, rfactor.net), GTR, GTL, RBS and the venerable GPL.  Great wheel feel with limited slip, sequential shifter works nicely as the e-brake for RBR and the multiple buttons and assignable pedal axis make this perfect for all applications.  Highly recommended.	1
Excellent product arrived today been using it all day long testing it with different games easy installalion love the leather on the wheel itself and picked up nascar sim racing 2005 to go with it awesome exsperience and a great product	1
The only down side of this title is that much of it is predictable.  Much better graphics and a good story.  Definitely worth playing, but limited in scope as compared to the original Half-Life where you didn't know what was coming next.	1
Cool and fun game, excellent graphics and my nVidia GTX 970 rips through it like there's no tomorrow.	1
:)	1
One of the best PC games ever made, period.  More then tops the original.  Great graphics but that's just the beginning of the HL 2 world.  You get to be Gordon Freeman, the silent hero in the world that has been conquered by aliens in the "7 Hour War" (you can read a blurb about this on a newspaper clipping on the wall, when you get to your friend Dr Vance's (voiced by Robert Guillame of TV fame) lab...the aliens have formed a "Combine" of aliens working with human "police", your enemy through the entire huge adventure.  The aliens have somehow also, prevented humans from REPRODUCING, there is not one single child in City 17, that is how scary these bastards are.  This world is revealed to you bit by bit and your job is to fight your way through "City 17" accomplishing many and various objectives on your way to "the core", your missions will be explained as you go and you will visit dozens of different environments and fight dozens of enemies - human, partly human, aliens of many kinds, and even machines - with the occasional help of your attractive but tough girl accomplice, Alex (Dr Vance's daughter).  None of this will make much sense until you play the game - and what a game this is!  I won't reveal spoilers, but you will be truly amazed at the array of weapons and vehicles that you will get introduced to  along the way, by the resistance (humans that are still fighting the combine).  This is a game not to be missed, the gameplay is near perfect, almost never gets dull, with never-ending, always changing challenges and amazing new weapons and environments introduced as you go.  If you've never played it, please don't miss out - there are two more stand-alone episodes that don;t require the base game to play, are equally a s good but much shorter...this though, is the one to start with, will keep you busy for hours and superior to almost any game still out there.  "We don't go to Ravenholm" (except when we do, and then it's only at night, armed with lots of big circular saw blades).	1
i have the Cd's but i can't play it. It does not have to codes, that is too bad :/	-1
The original Half-Life had a story (and it was fun). Half-Life 2 has no story (and after a short while, it gets boring).  You go through a building, and shoot bad guys. You go through a sewer, and shoot bad guys. You go through a building, and shoot bad guys. You go through a city block or two, and shoot bad guys. You go through a building, and shoot bad guys. You go through a city block or two, and shoot bad guys. You go through a building, and shoot bad guys. You go through a city block or two, and shoot bad guys. You go through a building, and shoot bad guys. Etc.  Boring. What's the point? There is no storyline.  Keep in mind that it's not just Half-Life 2, but also: * Half-Life 2: Episode 1 * Half-Life 2: Episode 2 * Half-Life 2: Lost Coast ...but the above 3 expansions must be purchased separately...and they are just more of the same...so, don't waste your time or money.  If you want to play this game, then save some time by using the cheat codes, and just play through it quickly.  This is a poor continuation/sequel to the classic original.

super FPS game with lots of weapons. Hardcore gamers won't be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is engaging(and not to short) , audio is excellent and the price is right.	1
Half Life 2 is the sequel to the highly fun and immersive, first person shooter, Half Life 1 where you are again Gordon Freeman.  Since this is a first person shooter, let's talk about the guns. For starters you have the basic weapons, pistols, machine guns, a shotgun, grenades, rocket launcher (RPG?) and so on. Some weapons have dual uses like the machine gun has a grenade launcher. The weapons feel very good to use. The pistol has never been so much fun to shoot wow! I'm shocked. The machine guns have real kick to them. The shotgun seems very effective. The rocket launcher is laser guided, which is fun to take down helicopters with. Launch it and guide it to the helicopter, because if you shoot it straight, the rocket will get shot down.  Now let's talk about the gravity gun, which is a highly duplicated gun. Personally the gravity gun seems more cumbersome to use it as a weapon. Sure it has its fun moments throwing a saw blade or an explosive canister at enemies, but the aim is imperfect and you need to grab something, turn and shoot it, but it should only be used when you're out of ammo... or if you want to change your style of mayhem.  The combat is rich and fulfilling with certain segments of driving such as a boat or car segment where you still get out and go into buildings to combat things. There are also puzzles and challenges to breakup the action just like there were with the original game. It keeps you thinking, sometimes over thinking. There are puzzles such as using a crane to move your car, using a washing machine to weigh down a platform and taking out a force field by rolling a car (trying not to spoil). There are less puzzles in this game than the last, most of the puzzles seem to involve combat like using the gravity gun as a weapon.  The graphics are amazing and detailed (on the PC, the X-Box version can look muddy close up). Everything is a vista it looks so good. Textures are detailed, areas are detailed as you travel on your journey. Lighting is beautiful both with dark and flame or bright lights. In fact one enemy has an attack that is a blinding bright light.  You really get a sense of distance traveled by this game. You aren't just put in levels that go here and there. This is a lot like a road trip where you span miles over the game. You see map locations and you travel through realistic areas whether they be ghettos, sewers, train yards, the west coast by the ocean in a car, abandon farms and down a river on a boat.  Level design is well thought out. Areas are very realistic and cluttered with things you'd really find in any given area. There are trees, junk, wrecked cars, beds, dilapidated walls, broken floors and so on. It really helps the immersion that these areas feel real instead of a typical video game level. This is a very linear game that does have little points of exploration, but you are cleverly guided through things that catch your eye. Like lights in a room are turned on or a character standing under a light and the game will condition you to subtle cues that they mean "go here" or characters will flat out say "run Gordon! Go now I'll hold them off."  There are several very fun and memorable situations such as climbing under a massive bridge only to have something happen. A graveyard firefight at the side of a priest, a den of giant spiders (head crabs),  The game has several new or altered enemies. Even the old enemies are more difficult and altered. There are new head crabs, the standard and the venomous kind. For humans that have a head crab on them, they are this game's zombies, smart, difficult, dangerous zombies. You can shoot them in the head, slice them in half, sometimes the head crab will hop off, they scream a horrifying muffled wail, but worst of all... if you don't get moving they will rise again in a matter of minutes. There are several terrifying enemies that with the dark and new lighting really disturbs you and sends a dread through you that other games fail to duplicate. The game really manages to terrify you through other ways, such as traveling beneath a giant bridge actually gives you a sense of height that is strangely intense because you fear falling when clearly this is a video game. Maybe that says something about the game's immersion.  Of course there are your run of the mill soldiers, and special ops enemies... but they are intelligent. Several enemies in the game are very intelligent and don't have patterns, but thought processes. Such as if they are injured, they will fall back and get a better position, if they have you pinned down, they will throw in grenades, rush in with guns blazing or bait you into firing at them. They will never line up to be shot; they will fan out so they can all shoot you.  I've mentioned the game's immersion, just like the previous Half Life, characters and friendly people will talk to you with their voices and not in a cut scene. You can walk around as they talk to one another. Nothing is stiff or forced. Good voice acting, but I feel like the previous game was better and less long winded when their characters talk. I know I should be paying attention, but I get more fun when they speak and I'm jumping on their heads. The game makers like to brag about everything being motion captured, but to be honest I never notice that their motions look real, which could be the intention. So good you won't get taken out of the game by a stiff or animated or robotic like in the previous game.  After getting several hours into the game and even playing through Half Life 1 and its expansions, I honestly don't know what's going on. I don't know how Gordon Freeman went from being in a complex fighting invading enemies to being in a city occupied by human soldiers. I feel like I missed a cut scene, and that really takes me out of the game, which they are really trying to keep you from being taken out.  The game also really seems to stroke your ego a lot. You went from being one man who steps up to being the only man who can save them and you're the new messiah. All hail you Gordon Freeman. Stop telling me I'm so great and just tell me what I have to do. It makes me think everyone in the game wants me to help it move...  The music is good and will show up at the right moments. It's nice. The sound is great and I never hear anything questionable or bad. Voice acting is great too.  In all the game is a lot of fun, but a lot of it isn't, especially if you're a little clueless as to what the story is, because the game won't help you with that right away at least. What might be an intense boat segment of the game might be a long annoyance for some people. Sometimes you can over think puzzles that aren't even really puzzles, but you miss a small lock to shoot off something and end up using the newly acquired gravity gun to pile junk to get over things. What could be a fun car segment with stops in between could be seen as an annoyance to have to stop, because the military has ambushed you or set up a force field.	1
It's unpatriotic.  I know what you're saying; "What the... are you crazy?  Unpatriotic?"  Yes, I said unpatriotic.  The original Half Life was set in the middle of the American mid-west, at a deep underground US government facility.  This latest game is set somewhere in Europe, and gives us a multi-ethnic love interest.  The love interest isn't bad in and of itself, and it really doesn't matter what race she is, so put your racist accusations away.  What I'm getting at is the fact that all of the game's contents are marketed not as an American product, but as one for a "global community".  To me that's a stab in the back.  It's subversive with good intentions, but still underhanded, and dilutes everything for which my nation created and stood for.  Let Gordon be Gordon, and let the game's love interest be whatever race, creed or nationality the can be.  Just put the damn thing back in the US of A.  What does this have to do with Half Life 2?  Well, how come we don't see US Special Forces trying to interfere again?  Suddenly the "G-Man" isn't some US secret service agent, but just some mysterious jerk.  Suddenly the American flag isn't posted anywhere.  Suddenly we're not in the US anymore, but in some European setting?  What the hell?  In an attempt to make commercial art viable for international markets, national identities and ethnicities are stripped.  Note how Gordon Freeman went from being a white MIT grad to a ambiguously ethnic scientist.  Again, put your racist label away, because what I'm wondering is why if there's such a concern over making this game marketable, why tinker with the game's foundations?  The graphics are sexy, as is the sound, and the story, for what it is, is okay.  But I still don't like it.  I want the Gordon Freeman and facility I bought in the late 90's brought back to life.  It's not going to happen.  It never will.  The G-# of nations have built their new social dynamic, and, unfortunately, it means pirating American culture and thought, and giving it to the world.  And that's why I don't like Half Life 2.	-1
It's true. This game DOES live up to its hype. Immersive, excellent plot and dialogue, and a blast to play. As a note, make sure you buy this game new or on Steam. The game only installs when it's a new copy.  Highlights:  * Immersive gameplay. Throughout the game, you're required to interact with the environment - objects, doors, etc. The music and sounds of the game will put you on the edge of your seat. During one of the missions, I was so scared to walk around, fearing a creature would come out of nowhere and jump at me.  * Graphics - For it's time (early 2000s), this game was ridiculously detailed. The engine it uses makes models, buildings, everything very detailed and smooth. Even today, graphics are still very good.  * Great plot and missions - You'll be running away, swimming, doing mini puzzles, manning a boat; basically, you're in for a wild ride.  * Interesting characters. Of course, you will be playing as the legendary Gorden Freeman, and getting help from Alyx and Eli Vance, as well as scattered individuals helping along the way. Dialogue is good too. Realistic and well done.  You get the sense that you've got the world on your shoulders and it depends on you to save it. If you're wondering if this game is one of the best ever, well it is. Intense, fun, and phenomenal gameplay.	1
This is the game that got me hooked on shooters. In that respect I guess it has a lot to answer for! And, along with Episodes 1 and 2, it remains my favourite to this day. Valve have taken their 1998 classic Half-Life and improved on it in every conceivable way. Much improved graphics, much improved physics, much improved AI, and much improved weapons, most notably the wondrous gravity gun. Once again it mixes a wide variety of spectacular environments with some satisfying puzzles and some fantastic combat. It also develops the story started in the original and fleshes it out nicely. Another important gain is the introduction of Alyx and her father Ely. Alyx will be a welcome companion and will, periodically, fight by your side. This is a big factor in HL2 -- the introduction of team play. You will have small bands of resistance fighters with you sporadically during play in the single player mode and this adds a team element which greatly increases immersion and the sense that what you do matters. I could bang on about this game for ever and a day, but just let me say this: play it -- you won't regret it.	1
It's incredible and amazing, the story, graphics, characters, physics, gameplay. You name it! And I do not know why so many people complain about Steam, it's really great to me.	1
Half Life 2 is one of the best games I've ever played.  It creates an excellent adventure that you will remember for a good while.  When it came out in 2004, it had the best graphics of just about any game of the year, but they look kind of dated by now.  The voice acting and music are both very well done, and really brought the story to life.  It may be a bit to graphic for some (zombies can be sliced in half, and there's lots of blood), but other than that it's fine for young teens and older.  There are tons of interesting weapons in the game, unlike many first person shooters I've played.  The Gravity Gun especially, but also the crossbow and those weird bug pod things.  The levels are interesting, with some neat little puzzles and situations.  The enemies are really cool; headcrab zombies are probably my favorite game enemies ever.  The vehicles added a surprising amount of emersion for me--I felt that being able to jump into a car, drive down a highway for a little while, then park and get out made the game so much more believable.  It doesn't really shine for the airboat sequences, unfortunately, so it's not until later in the game that you'll get to experience it.  Unfortunately, the whole experience isn't very long.  I've played through the whole game twice and only have 20 hours on my file.  And even then, sometimes the levels are suprisingly tedious--although only once or twice.  The story is pretty good.  I thought it was extremely interesting, although others may find they hate it for its lack of apparent depth and few, fairly weak, characters.  If you like sci-fi, though, you'll probably love this story.  It's like early 1940s Poland meets alien conspiracy.  There are lots of subtle details throughout the game that reveal larger parts of the history as well--although I'm mostly not speaking from experience, as I found very few of these.  My one issue with the story is that it's sometimes just a tool to explain how you get from place to place, most noticeably when you go from an underground rebel base to an abandoned mining camp.  That was weird.  The whole game is built with the free-with-purchase Source Engine.  It's a really good package for making your own mods and conversions, if you're into that kind of thing.  Personally, my favorite use of it is making the in game characters make goofy faces using the faceposer.  Of course, to get the game at all, you have to use the dreaded Steam.  I first tried the app for it, and, apparently since I hadn't bought anything on that account previously, it assumed I was a bot and prevented me from buying anything with my account.  Of course, it didn't TELL me that, so I didn't know, and just kept trying.  After several hours of it rejecting my purchase for no apparent reason, I finally found the answer online.  Then I had to email customer support to beseech them to unlock my account.  They responded pretty promptly, and I managed to buy it on my first try after that.  It's got to be my worst digital purchase experience ever, though, and I probably won't be buying anything else from Steam after this.  Once I got past the Steam barrier, though, I found what an amazing game this was.  I've got to admit that it was definitely worth it.  It's one of the best games I've ever played, and at $10, if you can get Steam to work (use the website!), you cannot pass this one up.	1
That's pretty much it.  I can't run my brandnew game because it requires broadband and I didn't know it.	-1
All the reviews bitching and moaning about Steam? They're spot-on.  Steam simply ruined this game for me.  It was HOURS from the time I unwrapped the box to the time when I could actually PLAY it.  And the trouble never stopped. For weeks I stubbornly kept playing, in spite of system freezes, interminable delays between maps, and frustration with one of the damn dune buggies, which was terribly difficult to drive because the graphics kept jumping and stuttering (in spite of my pretty decent system, well above minimum requirements).  And all this for the single-player game?!?!  I would say that I was playing the game maybe 50% of the time I spent trying to play it.  The other 50% was spent waiting for a map to load, waiting for Steam to authenticate me, and rebooting my damn PC every damn time the game brought it to a screeching, frozen halt.  And then one day, I had an epiphany.  The game play was pretty good. The puzzles were pretty good. I really liked that gravity gun.  But it just wasn't worth the hassle.  And it certainly wasn't worth relinquishing control of my system to that invasive Steam app. So I stopped playing.  I uninstalled it. And I never looked back.  I've not even been tempted this year to reinstall it and see if maybe some of the early bugs have been worked out.  I'd give the game away or sell it, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone with whom I'm on speaking terms -- or even an unwitting stranger.  And I will NEVER, EVER buy another game that uses Steam or its ilk.  I was shocked when I installed the game to see what kind of control I had to hand over to Steam in order to run the single-player game.  I crossed my fingers, ignored my instincts, and let it run anyway.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  What a terrible precedent to set in the PC software world.  I won't succumb again.	-1
It's been a few years since I played this "masterpiece" but I remember it well.  Half Life 2 is a sci-fi/first person shooter that follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman. And by adventures I mean, shooting stuff and being denied information about what's going on by everyone. Of course you can infer a vague aliens took over the planet plot in the first 2 minutes, and the inference is about all you'll ever know. Cliche ridden sci-fi ambience aside, the real problem with Half Life 2 isn't the monsters in game but the monsters in the programming.  You see, when it came out there was a bug that seemed to randomly hit people. The bug caused stuttering with sound and hitches in gameplay, even on high end machines. The bug STILL exists and shows up in Source licensed games. I can only be confounded at how a development studio which as much money as they have can't make a stable game. id can do it. Crytek can do it and beat the pants off everyone else's technology. What's up with Valve? Aside from the infamous stutter bug, there are the load times that don't make any sense. Load times that are as if you're defragging your entire HD each time, it takes so long. How do you play a game under such maddening intermissions taking you out of the action? This is a problem that also has NOT been fixed despite Valve's ability to update their game. Add in the sloppy jalopy that is Steam, a piece of software you are forced to run to play their games, and I am utterly fed up with Valve's software practices. They just aren't up to par.  The last point I would like to bring up is the level design of HL2 was a joke. It was linear. As in, well a straight line of gameplay. It's almost shocking, like, am I playing Star Fox? Am I playing a 2D scrolling shooter for the NES? Why on Earth would they take the ability to make open 3D designs, and make every level a linear walk to point A,B,C... ugh, some of the worst shooter levels I've seen, although the office areas of F.E.A.R. trump it I guess. The thing is, Far Cry came out before Half Life 2, and you know what? It was wonderfully open ended. Sure you had to complete the objectives, but you weren't in a little of tube of gameplay with no other choices. Valve seemed to have gone backwards gameplay-wise, like another bigshot that crashed, id with Doom 3, they could not capitalize on the things that make gameplay great and so the game was just a hollow tribute to lots of money spent on art and self worship.  That said, I think Valve is very gradually trying to overcome the criticisms levied at them. It's not happening overnight, but I wonder, maybe we'll see a Half Life 3 that makes everyone happy and not just those who like their games dead simple.	-1
Ever since I first Slumped the Specimine into the the anti-Mass Spetromitor in the first game. I've been addicted to Half-life. and found that leaving me with more questions then answers worked when this game first came out.  I was ungry for more! and more is just what I got... More action, More cool weapons to play with, and yes... More Questions then answers.  But this time around. the characters and allies in the game tore my heart out and tugged on them so hard tat i emotionally connected to teir plights. Then again their rebal AI was pretty bad. I ended up not caring if the NPC folled me or not and if they did, I tended to lead them into a mine field or two before I did anything more important later.  Still the game was fun fast and action packed. I loved swinging the Crowbar once more and a new gagit like the gravity gun was great too.	1
Valve has the perfect con going.  They charge you forty bucks to buy a game that you can't play UNLESS you use steam to verify that you actually bought it but since STEAM may make your computer crash or freeze your system so you can't actually play the game and since you opened the box you can't return it to the the store and get your money back.  INTELLECTUAL COPYRIGHT FASCISM has led to this state of affairs where crooks like VALVE can sell you products that don't work and YOU don't have the right to get your money back.  Boycott VALVE and don't ever download games (from any company) so that we don't get to a future where STEAM is the only way to play games at all.  That is the future these INTELLECTUAL COPYRIGHT HOLDER FASCISTS are drooling over. Don't give it to them.	-1
bought game through amazon marketplace. sealed and new, with no manual and no key code. be careful.	-1
Though i am sure this is a good game i may never know thanks to this aweful little devil called STEAM! this program is clearly a violation of privacy as it hijacks your Pc in the attemps to keep the game from being pirated. In doing so it alienates all of the good people out there just wanting to play the game of the year. It is such a buggy program that all of a sudden i cannot even put in a half life Cd without my Pc freezing up requiring a restart. I will never purchase any product containing STEAM and anyone who does is asking for trouble. I warned ya!! thank me later!!! Thanks STEAM/VALVE,,i will spend my money on products not associated with you.	-1
This game is awesome!  Graphix are sick!  Cudos to the Black Mesa Team.... lookin' forward to the next HL release.	1
I love this game and keep playing it over and over. Super graphics and game play; I enjoyed the boat and buggy once I got used to driving them!  This is a terrific sequel to the classic HL.	1
A ridiculously realistic game this is! you can literally pick up even a broken bottle, can, a pot, anything. pick up your enemy's weapon and throw it somewhere if you ammo is full, with the gravity gun, take a matress and blast it into water. even take a saw and rip your zombie enemies in half! This game has a huge amount of replay because of this and many more. if you have a graphics card 256 MB or higher, you'll be in for a treat as the water detail is some of the best ever in any game known to mankind! (well, I mean right now). The only things that makes me sad about this game is that it doesn't have the full goriness unlike the first game, where you can take a grenade and blow your enemy to pieces. And an internet connection is required (REQUIRED) because you have to set up a free steam account (the only charges are for buying games).Seriously though, get this game, I don't care if you get this version, a game of the year, whatever. make sure that your computer has the internet.	1
Absolutely stunning, jaw-dropping game. Its graphics are fantastic even with a low-end machine. (Mines a amd4000+, bfg 7800 oc, 1gb ram, maxtor diamond max10). So don't worry cause my gfx before was a 9800 128mb pro.  Anyway, this game will really get your heart pounding, and a funny thing is, you will hear yourself making strange little noises you never knew you could make, just from the sheer fear and excitment from being chased by the Combine. I am not a spoiler, but the door is OPEN.  IM WAITING!  And by the way... Steam is not that bad guys.  Verification can be a bit -raunchy- but you can also test free demos, and dl new games without messing with all the disks and what-not.  Do yourselves a favor, and go out and buy this masterpiece.  If you haven't already, see if you can find MaxPc's review of the game (dec. 2005 issue I believe).  MIND-BLOWING.  In my opinion, F.E.A.R. has got nothing on HL2.	1
I tend to get tired of fawning reviews of many FPS titles. Many go on about the graphics, the intelligent AI, the world physics etc. and the reason I get bored of this is that most of these titles, while good....maybe adequate, they don't really stand out from the pack. HL2 does and it does so dramatically.  The tired gamers' term, "immersiveness" is finally fully realized. And it's accomplished not by the cheap "creatures jumping out of a dark shadow" tricks but by oftentimes doing things in the scenery that are so surprising  that on occasion I found myself lingering in certain areas just to play around with the game environment.  All FPS titles employ a certain amount of puzzle solving/jumping problem situations and in many titles the solution feels arbitrary. In HL2 every single one is perfectly based in real world solutions and each is absolutely logical. I won't give any away but suffice it to say that they all simply require you to be human living on planet earth to solve. That is, the solutions are exactly what you would have to do if you came upon the situation in a real life environ.  I also don't really usually care too much for the story of the game...one reason that I loved Painkiller since it had virtually no story and was just straight ahead inspired running and gunning...but HL2 has an interesting story that makes you really feel that you are a player in a motion picture.  And of course, as they use to say on Second City TV..."things get blowed up real good!" The action is exciting ala "Call of Duty" and the weaponry ranges from the basics to the inspired...you have to love that gravity gun.  My only gripe - fairly long load times between scenes. When I played this on my home system, which is decent but not the equal of the newest gaming rigs I assumed it was my machine's relative lack of horsepower that was the reason. Not so. I ventured to a local gaming cafe and played a few levels on a fully tricked out Athalon 64 system complete with NVIDIA's best PCI Express video card and the load times were still annoying.  So - they lose a point for that. Otherwise, this is a brilliant bit of work that like the addictive TV show "24" just makes you want to get the next bit as soon as possible. Come to think of it...I think Jack Bauer would enjoy this game.	1
Over 500 reviews already so what can I add :o).  Well looking at it reviewers fall into 2 camps - they either love it or hate it and I can understand why!  The good -  1) Awesome graphics. HL1 was a big step forward in graphics and HL2 managed to do the same again. The people and places are photorealistic and you could almost get the hots for your femail co-lead.  2) Great puzzles, the thing that elevates HL above the mindless Quake 4 is the puzzles.  I especially loved the use of weight.  3) Fantastic game play.  You have to keep your cool or face the consequences. A huge variety of bad guys from the mindless Zombies to the covert snipers.  You are joined by a team of willing helpers towards the end, which is great.  The bad -  1) Short (can be done in just over 2 hours - I've seen the video!!) and I imagine less than 30 hours even for the slowest player. HL1 was perhaps overly long at over 60 hours, but much better value for money.  2) loading, loading, loading - over 2 hours to update the game before I could play it - why bother sending out the DVD at all - why noy just download it! Tediuous or what.  3) loading, loading, loading - over 5 minutes per level on my (not slow) machine, sometimes for only 10 minutes of game play. Comapare this with GTA San Andreas - did you ever see it load? This is NOT ACCEPTABLE!!  So all the reviewers are right - its a bitter-sweet experience, and from my point of view a missed opportunity. If you played HL1 then its a must have but I would certainly make sure I read a respected review of HL3 (presuming there will be one) before buying it.	1
Half Life 2 is a very great game. Out of all the PC games i played which is many LOL, this would be the best game ever!!! This game only has 2 cons and a few pros.  Pros: 1. The graphics are superb and they give the best detail ive ever seen...  2. You get to drive a boat, get a gravity gun which is awesome, and battle very cool looking creatures.  3. Very cool weapons and guns to put down you foes..  4. The character is very likable, hes like a duke nukem of the sci fi games.  Cons: 1. Unfortanately, you need a very good computer to play it and a good graphics cards as well. My game lagged the whole time i played making it very slow and choppy and froze alot. So, i didn't get the real experience of playing.  2. You have to install 5 cds and it takes quite a while to do it. Plus, you have to install Steam which takes a while to install right. So, the waiting time sucks and steam and the game together take up half your computer's space. (people with lots of space and room don't worry about the space problem.)  Overall, besides the install times it is the best PC game of all time and the funnest. Anyone who plays Pc games should definitely buy this one... definitely!!!!!	1
I had fallen way behind in computer gaming, so recently I built a new computer with good components. The first game I decided to buy was Half-Life 2, and I have to say that it more than lives up to the hype. I finally understand what everyone is talking about when they talk about great first-person shooter games.  Pros:  Fantastic graphics: very pretty backgrounds. I have absolutely no problems whatsoever. No jaggies or ghosting. I have all graphic settings on high. My graphics card is the EVGA geForce 6800GS and the processor is an AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+.  Good physics: Objects move and behave as they really would. Tires roll, metal screeches, glass shatters, etc.  Great story line: I like the way it keeps the plot moving along.  Great audio: I constantly feel like I'm being chased because you can hear the helicopters in the background.  Good AI: The AI opponents use realistic tactics to trap you and avoid your fire. The friendly NPCs behave realistically. Their dialouge is influenced by your behavior! And their eyes follow you around the room!  Immersive atmosphere: In the beginning sequences, I really felt like I was being chased. I was playing in the dark, and as I jumped off fire escapes and busted down doors and ran around buildings, my heart was racing. At first I was like, why the heck is my hearbeat so high, and then I realized it was because the game was so dang realistic! Awesome.  Cons:  I think the puzzles are good, not too difficult to solve and  you get a sense of accomplishment, but if you don't like puzzles, I can see how you might think it's a little tedious. How many times do you want to move boxes so you can reach a window or uncover a hole in the floor?  That's about it.  Other: It only took me about 20 minutes to install all 5 discs and another 20 minutes or so to download Steam. If you're using dial-up and an older computer, this time may take longer. Also, you do NOT need to connect to the Internet every time you play Half-Life 2. There is an offline mode. Just follow the instructions included on the quick reference card in the package.	1
I have no idea how this game is getting so much hype!!!! i mean its not even that good.  Pros -Good graphics but not the best -Some unique weapons (e.g. gravity gun) -Midly interesting story  Cons -STEAM You have to DOWNLOAD AFTER THE LAST CD FOR LIKE AN HOUR! then whenever you play the single player you are linked to the internet.  Now this is a problem because it can leave some computers vulnerable. -Ending was very bad -WAY TOO LINEAR!  I felt like i was being forced to do stuff by a "higher power" -Whenever i was  it felt very unconvincing and i couldn't get into this game at all  Overall this game is bad and defiantely not worth the hype it has gotten from so many people  I would suggest buying Quake 4 (if you have a good enough graphics card for it)	-1
The only thing that put me off buying the game initially was reading other people's reviews complaining about STEAM and the need to be online.  Installation can be long but once you are connected to the net you don't have to keep using the CDs/DVD. The best thing about this game (especially over DOOM 3) is that you do not need a supercomputer to run it. I have a Geforce 6800 GT with a gig of ram and P4 3hz, but it runs fantastic on my brother's Geforce 5200 FX (though, obviously, the more RAM the better, but it will run fine on older computers - though settings may have to be reduced to get great performance).  The game itself is brilliant. Everything that was missing in DOOM 3 can be found here. Vast sprawling open areas to make the most out of the excellent weapons (rocket launcher, gravity gun, grenades). DOOM 3 is a good game, but I never understood the need for a rocket launcher when most of the time you are in a room the size of a broom cupboard with six monsters.  The enemies in HL2 have an AI that make for a more believable gaming experience. Plus, the monsters who look like they have frozen turkeys for heads are back!  The gravity gun is fantastic, especially when picking up rusty circular saw blades and firing them at the turkey-head monsters. You can also pick up pots of paint and fire them at them, leaving them with white faces.  The ragdoll effects are great and the puzzles are done just right to make them fun rather than stalling the pace of the game. The graphics are excellent and the environment resembles some sort of east european war torn city sprawl (with highrise flats and sewers).  The only drawback is that it can be easy and not long enough (HL 1 was a lot longer - though it had lesser graphics and environmental scope).  Extras include:  - HL2 Deathmatch (great at first but can get tiresome) - Counter Strike: Source (brilliant online game where you can  play against other gamers - and lose all the time, as in my case) - Plus, other extras yet to be released.  Not everyone has access/or can afford to be online so why don't VALVE release a version that can be played and installed offline? Of course, the online extras will be missing (HL2 Deathmatch, CS: source) so why not release a cheaper version for those who are offline?	1
Half Life 2 is the greatest game you will ever play. Plain and Simple. The graphics are incredible even though the game is two years old. To get the best out of it though you will need a good graphics card. Though adverage computers will run it with ood framerate, though you will have to turn down down some settings. The weapons are good also. The gravity gun is the coolest weapon from any first prson shooter. Alot of people complain about Steam, which is Valves online service. The people complaining, probably have dial up. Well thats why its slow for them.  pros: graphics    gravity gun    plot    um...best game ever  cons: nothing	1
Half the reviews i read about this game are negative, now how a PC games gets it for Game Of The Year with all this negative feedback i'll never know, but really i do. This game is (was) way ahead of its time and still is here in 2005, yes we have beautifully graphically enhanced games like, Far Cry, Doom 3, Painkiller, and so on, big deal. These games while fun in there own right, get very mundane and i myself can onl stand to play them for around half-an-hour or so. I love Doom and have been a huge fan since 1991 or whenever it was first released, but it does get a little boring quickly. There is not much interaction with people, you can't pick up objects, or throw anything or even really talk to anyone for that matter. Then there is Far Cry, in which i think the only great thing about it is the Water effects, it is spectacular. However the game is extremely to hard and it gets old that everytime you get killed you must start back at the same point with the same amount of energy and ammo that you died with. Also there is no Quicksave feature. So many of this games are fun but redudant.    Half-Life 2 is very "engaging" to say the least from what i've played thus far, and it only looks more and more promising the more i play it. First off yes the graphics are superb, but it mostly the interaction in the game with dozens of people that make it amazing. You can basically interact with anything and everyone in the game. Much like a a FPS Elder Scrolls. The main problem i have is allll the complaining, i just upgraded one of my computers with this: AMD sempron 2800+(anyone who tells you its no good for gaming is on crack) its just as good as the AMD Athlon 64. 768megs of RAM, all games run flawlessly. And last but not least a nVidia 5200 FX card at 128mb(Yes this is a value card that many people put down), well guess what works just as good as a card you pay 150-200 dollars for, so don't believe what people tell you. Actually i got it for 23 bucks because STAPLES messed up on the discount, and the rebates. Lucky ME.    First off i have a 56k connection on my Desktop for now, until i move and get DSL, everyone says ohh it will suck and be unplayable(wronngg). There are very few times that any lag hits, if it does its very minimal, i'm sure that wireless and DSL are probably better but i don't think your just gonna be "blown away" by a faster connection. Also i never had one issue in updating, so it took 45 minutes to update Steam, whoopie, go eat for 45 minutes or watch TV if you have dial-up. Also there wasn't one installation problem here, ran great. The longest update was the game itself, probably one hour, again no big deal. Also when it asks(or tells you) that you need to update your drivers on your video card, don't take this at face value, i didn't update them and again it runs great. So where in the world everyone gets all this rubish from about how the game does this and does that i have no idea. Must not have a very top notch computer or they must have to much firewall and antivirus crap on it. At any rate this game is getting better everyday, i can even play it on a laptop with OpenGL extreme graphics on a lower resolution and what? You guessed it..runs fine. Later	1
Select people have hated on this game for accusing the game for thinking it's perfect.  Well that's true, but is that the only reason u dislike this game.  Give me a perfect 1st-person shooter?  Yeah i thought so.  For those that have not played this game, buy it.  You'll enjoy it, and don't get confused from reviews complaining about quirky AI.  The AI is not perfect, but good enough to make it a wonderful experience.  Not many games can balance action with a smart storyline...and Half-Life has continued to do that.  No this isn't the Godsend of PC games, but it's close.  Buy it, you'll enjoy it.  And make sure u have a broadband connection to the internet so you'll have no other excuse to put down this game.	1
I just spent over an hour installing this game on my dial up modem which uses the most insane installation process I have ever seen.  There is no booklet included in the box.  There is only one cheap card which tells you that you can play offline if you check the "remember my password" box, except there is no "remember my password" box to check anywhere during the installation process. So when I tried to play the game I was told that I would have to wait 136 minutes, and I presume that was online.  These people are so paranoid that somebody might rip them off that they have devised an installation scheme which is unbelieveable.  But if they want to rip me off, well that's another matter altogether.  I regard Valve and Sierra as thieves and criminals.  I uninstalled their garbage from my PC and will have it in the garbage can tomorrow.  I will never buy anything else from these crooks.	-1
Though I never originally purchased a Half life game, now I definitely won't.  You people on here are pathetic!  Only fanboys of Valve would tollerate whatever the company does.  "Praise the Company!"  Your blood is boiling as you read this?  GOOOD!  I hope so.  I like people mad at me.  Because instead of knocking this review you should be knocking the aa h at Valve and Steam. If your not, then I hope you rupture a splean and get a stroke from this review.  You are a waist of human tissue and material that could be used to make other babies.  When the people at CGW who are rude in general start pansy-ing up to the Valve people like Newel then something is indeed wrong.  Jeff Green can insult his costumers but we know he wouldn't dare knock the all-mighty-valve.  What a woosie!  Let me explain something to you PC layman types.  WIndows XP Has an activation process...  OKay I don't like it but you only do it once!  Half Life, Half Life II and all other accompying games require you to be online not only during activation but when PLAYING the game(single included).  YOu have to continually PROVE you own the game.  How Hitler is that?  Neverwinter Nights is trying this with thier fan based mods but they have also lost a customer as I only play the Trilogy and don't buy into mods that require connection all the time when it is unnessasary.  ALSO.  Weather you  like it or not, your credit card is charged without prior knowledge and once you activate Steam, they can charge you(legally) for anything at anytime.  So you had best know what your getting into before purchasing the game whether boxed or downloaded it's the same.  You should be spanked for saying Kudo's to such a greed bunch of paranoid overly protective jerks like valve and thier partners.  Thats the news and I am outta here!	-1
If you buy this used you will have to send the CD and all packaging INTACT back to Valve for replacement due to CD key being registered to only one user. It will cost $10.00 and take 6 to 8 weeks.  The instructions at Valve say that if you buy it used then ALL the packaging has to be sent back. How often do you receive all the original packaging when you buy something?  I just bought a used copy, and found that Valve's registration system was a ripoff. rather than dump this game on another unsuspecting idiot I have thrown it away.	-1
There is nothing bad to say about this game. It has it all!!!  Continueing in the tradition of Half Life. Half Life 2 is a sequel that should not be passed by. A must for all shooters!!!!	1
Half-Life 2 has been out for nearly a year now. Having recently played though the game a third time at high difficulty, I decided write a review, despite the multitude of raves already on display here.  HL2 was released last November, and yet I can't think of a single game released since that's come close to this level of verisimilitude. This speaks volumes of the competancy and creativity that resides within the offices of Valve. HL2 has....nearly everything. A balanced weapons set. Amazing graphics. Excellent voice acting. An intriguing plotline. Some really over-the-top action sequences and surprises around almost every corner.  So what sets Half-Life 2 apart from the crowd? Being a First-Person-Shooter veteran going on a 12 years now, I've put way too much thought into this....  1) More than any other next-gen shooter on the market, Half-Life 2 is subtle. This is not to say that the action isn't intense (in some ways, almost "soil your pants" intense), but at least HL2 gives you room to breath. Fight your way past soldiers exhibiting some impressive AI, and then you've got some time to get your bearings. Enjoy the scenery. Play around with the environment.  2) Unlike games like Doom 3, HL2 does not lay on the scares too thick. My main issue with Doom 3 was the over-reliance upon shock-value to generate entertainment. After the 30th room wherein the lights suddenly went out and baddies teleported in from nowhere, I found myself getting numb to it. For the most part, HL2 doesn't rely upon this tactic. Yes, its often pretty freaky, but not mindnumbingly so.  3) HL2 has environmental interactivity in spades. The inclusion of the Gravity Gun adds so much fun to the game and allows a level of play creativity that just doesn't exist in other shooters. Yeah, the Doom 3 expansion pack included a similar weapon, but it felt like an after thought.  4) The Source Engine is a thing of beauty. In some ways, Doom 3 is a better looking game. Its use of light surpasses what the Source Engine is capable of. From what I understand, the Doom 3 Engine (D3E) is also capable of rendering some impressive outdoor scenes, but that's only "what's been said". And while ID claims D3E can handle it, Valve actually delivers the goods. Its not **quite** photorealistic, but its as close as anything on the market. Source's ability to scale itself down for compatibility with older graphics chipsets is a nice bonus, so provided you've got a 1.2ghz machine and a GeForce 3 card, you can still run HL2 at a playable framerate.  5) There's an old photography adage that says "as long as the eyes are in focus, a person will understand what he/she is looking at". And while it sounds lame, you'd have to see the game in action to understand. As far as character animation goes, the eyes are everything. They convey fear, bemusement, misunderstanding, desperation. Play though the level "Follow Freeman!" or "Anticitizen One", and you'll understand. Fighting the Combine in City 17 alongside the resistance, you can see the emotions of your followers. They're freaking out, they're uncertain and they just might die. Again, you can see those emotions in these characters. This adds so much verisimilitude, its astounding.  6) Half-Life 2 is a shooter. But in levels like "Route Kanal" and "Highway 17", its also an arcade racer. Then Valve throws down the gauntlet and turns HL2 into an insense survival-horror shooter in "We Don't Go To Ravenholm...." There's more variety here than this review can do justice to.  7) Memorable characters. Alyx, Eli Vance, Dr. Kleiner, Barney, Dr. Breen, Judith Mossman, the robotic Dog, the irrepresible Barney and the unearthly Man In The Suit. I don't typically think of much the characterization and plotting of most games, even RTSs with extended cut-scenes. Just given the fact that I CAN remember those character names is an impressive feat in and of itself. It means alot of care went into the creation of these characters.  8) "Strider!" Play it. You'll understand. While yer at it, watch out for falling smokestacks.  The list goes on and on. The jaw-dropping set-pieces. The boss battles that don't feel like the forced "boss-battles" of old. The organic use of light and the lived-in feel of the world that HL2 inhabits. It makes you want more.  Which brings me to my last point. Valve is close to releasing an additional (and free) level to Half-Life 2 called "The Lost Coast" (shoehorned between "Highway 17" and "Sandtraps"). Mostly, Valve intends "Lost Coast" to demonstrate some new rendering technology (HDR) which will more realistically depict the reflection of high-intensity light. Sounds kinda hokey, with the way I'm explaining it (I'm not a tech-head), but from the screenshots I've seen, HDR will drastically improve graphical realism. But you'll need some horsepower to play the game at full-detail with HDR enabled - either a Radeon x800 Pro or a GeForce 6800GT.  So thats all I had to say. If you've somehow neglected to save the world for a 2nd time as Gordon Freeman, the ubiquitous everyman PhD from MIT, you've done yourself a grand disservice. Rectify this oversight immediately. You'll be glad ya did.	1
Half-life 2 is a perfect state of the art game with no flaws. It is game-of-the-year its even better than Halo 2.  The graphics are amazing everything looks realistic to the point of which a retard might think it is real. The map is well put toghether and the enviroment around looks outstanding.  Half-life 2 has physics never seen in a viedo game. Any object light weighted can be used to throw or gather to use to help slove nifty puzzles and missions. You can move almost any object to cause chain reactions of movement and style. You will be traped with the almost real characters and life like physics.  The story will really keep you playing, to find out the next little bit of whats going on. At the begging of half-life 2 you don't no whats going on so the game traps you to try to find out. There are no Cut-Scenes, you live the cut-scenes you can move around while learning whats going on. Half-life 2 is a gore fest of fun, and is like War of the worlds on a disk. There are no negitives, the graphics are the best any game has to offer, and you will fall in love with the gameplay and story mode of this perfect game. No question it got 5 stars before i played it. If you have a good-running computer do yourself a favor and get Half-life 2.	1
I remember the original Half-Life. It was...revolutionary, so to speak. And now it's back. I LOVE IT! THANK YOU, VALVE! THANK YOU! That's right, this game is amazing!  Graphics-10/10  (If my jaw wasn't dropped, I'd tell you that every aspect of the graphics is flawless. Character models, textures, it's all perfect.)  Sound-10/10  Half-Life 2 has some excellent sound effects and music as well.  Control-9/10  To have really easy-to-use control, you'll have to buy a really fancy mouse.  Story-10/10  There's not much of a story, but there doesn't need to be. Oh yeah, and you actually LIVE the cut-scenes!  Gameplay-11/10  I know what you're thinking. (11/10!!! That doesn't even exsist!)  Well, this game makes it exsist. That's how fun it is!  Overall-10/10  This is an amazing game worthy of the Half-Life name. Valve has once again changed FPS's forever.	1
Okay, after all the trouble it was to download and get started, it was still more than well worth it. This beats the original hands down. It was a visual feast with many, many surprises. The gravity gun was just amazing (especially towards the end when it had more power). The interaction with almost all objects as well as the physics engine makes this, in my opinion, one of the best first person shooters ever made.  Dang, this was some fun.  Highly recommended.	1
The game is top notch--no complaints there.  My gripe is dealing with Steam.  Yeah it took a long time to download (several hours) and register with Steam.  All was fine for many months until I foolishly let Steam update it's files while I tried to start the game while still connected to the Internet (I just do single player, no multi for me).  The Steam update (which I suspect I didn't have to have) totally screwed up my game.  It won't let me play now.  I can't access the game at all.  I've tried a myriad a way to figure out this puzzle.  Be cautious of this game unless you are a total geekmeister.  I do OK, but I'm no geekmeister.  After numerous emails and FAQ searches with Steam, I gave up and haven't played since my ability to do so was STOLEN by Steam--which really means a Steaming pile of poo!	-1
HL2 follows up the late 90's smash with a nearly perfect sequel.  The new engine is amazing and the single player is truly incredible, if a bit too short for my taste.  The real meat of this package is the online mods however.  Make  sure you get a version that will allow you unfettered access to both the original mods (TFC, CS, Day of Defeat, Natural Selection, etc) as  well as the new mods (CS:Source, DOD:Source, etc).  Valve pioneered the use of community to build and improve their games after release when they released their level-editing software (worldcraft) as well as the SDK (Software Dev Kit) for complete remakes to the public for free.  This is why HL1 (mods) are still some of the most played games on the internet today, and will continue to grow with time.	1
first of all. ignore the so called kids review....lil kids shouldnt be playin this (note: cus he puked he probly glued his face lieterly 1 inch from screen...geez thatll make me puke) . This game in single player is awsome. I havnt gotten my cd version yet but when i played over steam it was great single play and multiplay, same with CS:S. graphics are amazing and beats down halo2's graphics for the xbox with a stick. if you liked the first game or not ull love this. Be warned: i advise getting this cd version cus sometimes if u have steam version they might screw up ur comp and steam version won't be compatiable after that....did for me... so get cd's	1
There are so many different subjects to praise Half Life 2 on but I thought I'd focus on one, the physics in the game. The game I played immediately before HL2 was the latest Splinter Cell. The difference in the two games is stark as Chaos Theory operates with a completely static environment. Chairs, tables, boxes are all completely immovable as if the entire world were cast from a single block of steel. Half Life 2, on the other hand has an incredibly malleable environment. Cinder blocks can be picked up and placed down with actually physical weight. Plastic barrels bob around in water. Wooden platforms collapse when supports are taken out. If the bottom box of a stacking is removed the rest of the boxes collapse realistically. Manipulating the environment is nothing new but Half Life's physics are probably as close to reality as has ever been done in a game.  One of the biggest problems since the advent of 3D environments has been the clipping problem. How many times has a guy collapsed to the ground only to have his head pass right through a nearby wall or his gun float eerily in the air? HL2 seems to have somewhat solved the clipping problem and that alone makes it groundbreaking. Rather than phase into a wall people collapse and lean against them. The only other game I ever saw with this good of a treatment of physical barriers was Eternal Darkness on the GameCube. It's still not perfect as bodies can still merge with boxes but it's a definite improvement on most 3D games.  The other physical effect I loved was the treatment of water. If you have a system that can handle full water reflection it... looks... AMAZING. The water really does look like water. In some games water tends to look more like it has the consistency of silver Mercury but HL2 nails it. Looking up from within water has an amazing distorting effect that I haven't seen since Mario Sunshine.  As good as it is there is still room for improvement. You don't really pick up items so much as have them hover before you. Also, you can't seem to turn or tilt items. If you pick up a barrel that's lying on its side you don't seem to be able to tilt it and lay it on its end. You can kind of smack it around until it might randomly pop onto its end but it's not quite the way things work in reality. There was one time in the game when a door seemed to get caught on a collapsed body. There seemed to be no way to close the door and it was blocking my path so I ended up having to go back to a previous save. Still, these are complaints aimed at a game with the best physical effects I've ever seen. NL2 will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the all time great games and a definite advancement in the field of physical simulations.  Half Life 2 requires a hefty system. I got an excellent frame rate and maxed out all visual stats except for a few effects like anti-aliasing. Here's what I had.  P4 3.0 GHz  1 Gig of memory  ATI RADEON X600	1
Half Life is my favorite game of all-time. So when HL2 was coming out, my expectations were high.  Thankfully, this game lives up to the hype.  The graphics are very good. I have seen many reviews stating that the games graphics look dated. Hogwash I say. There are very few games that compare graphically.  The sound, the story, and the physics (though overused a little) are also very good. Plus the game has several hours of playing time for the SP. The only other SP FPS game that had this many hours was the original HL. And the fact that there are alot of friends, enemies, weapons, and completely different locations to visit makes the SP very interesting. And some of the things you have to battle makes this a challenging and fun game.  One of the other problems I heard about was Steam. Steam is Valve's program for all of the games. I personally have had very little trouble with it and I like it. No more searching the interent trying to find the new patch or maps for the games. Steam automatically updates all of this for you (except for maps made by other servers).  As for the MP, CS:S is fun and they keep giving new maps every couple of months. The only real problem is cheaters. The anti cheat that Valve was supposed to release has not happened yet. But when it does, accounts caught cheating could be banned which i believe is a good thing. There are plenty of maps and servers to play and with the addition of new maps, it stays fairly fresh.  HL2DM is ok. There are not as many servers and most of them are very laggy which is strange considering I get excellent latency on CSS. There are also a bunch of maps (including old ones from HL like Gasworks and Crossroads) to play. I enjoy it when the latency is good, but it is pretty tough to find a good server.  The fact that the SP is so long and you get 2 MP games here that that alone makes it worth it. PErsonally, I love the game and can't wait until Aftermath (this is supposed to be another Steam update. Is it free? Hope so) comes out. Some people still hold a grudge against Valve because it took so long. But almost every game today has delays. I am just happy it came out. If you liked HL, you will definitely enjoy this.	1
All I can say is that I'm impressed with this game, Valve put a lot of work into this game. You only need to go online once with steam, afterwards all you have to do is double click on the half life icon, and load your saved game, thats it. It most certainly have better graphics, than any other first person shooter I've played, almost TV like. Everything is set to high on my computer. I'm running a Gateway 550 GR 3.2 gig processor/HT, 1 gig of memory. I connects using a 56 k dialup modem,had no problems. Took about 3 hours to load everything. I hope this helps somebody. Thank You, Romeo Henry Faison	1
HL2 is perhaps one of the most overhyped games of the year (aside from doom 3). It isn't a bad game, but it isn't bar raising or genre shattering, it just uses the elements from the original HL and sticks with them. In short, HL2 plays it safe. And that works for the most part, as the gameplay itself is immersive and breathtaking. Character design and voice acting are superb, of top notch quality. The only downside is the ending, if it can be called that at all. It was extremely anti-climatic, and it let me down some. When you're able to take down a Strider with just two shots from the Uber-weapon you get in the Citadel, as opposed to multiple rockets and a lot of running on the streets prior to the Citadel, it just makes you throw your hands up in disgust. Also, the ending left something to be desired, such as closure, of which there was a considerable lack of. I guess we'll just have to wait another five plus years to fiugre it all out...	1
Half Life 1 used to be the best game, now Half Life 2 definetely is. Its got a great storyline, provides the gamer with excellent graphics and the audio is amazing.  Graphics: Like i said, the graphics are superb. Next to Doom 3, Half Life 2 probobly has the best graphics. The background animation is definetely one to brag about, the character models are very well made and the cutscenes provide the gamer with sharp/crisp detail.  Gameplay: The gameplay is Half Life 2 is also extremely good. The controls take a little while to get used to, but once you do get used to it, you will have a blast. Its one of those games where your either fighting many enemies at one time, or trying to figure out a challenging puzzle/where to go next.  Audio: The audio in Half Life 2 is probobly the best out of all the computer games, once again, besides Doom 3. Doom 3 takes features to a whole new level...Half Life 2, however does sound extremely realistic with the voices, and the footsteps. Also, the sounds of bullets are amazing as well.  If you want to play online, you have to get Half Life Deathmatch at a shop or over [...]	1
this is not a game as much as it is an experiance. You get sucked into this world, and its great world. Its one of the best worlds ever made in an action. I say action game because they are usually less story oriented and so the world isn't to great. Like ff7 world can beat this games world anyday, but this world blows dooms world out of the water. I have only played half-life out of the big three of 2004, which was doom and far cry. But I can tell you way i choose to play this game above those because i read lots and lots of reviews. Doom is a very linear experiance, you walk down corridors and shoot things that get in your way. Far cry has bad save point placements that will annoy the hell out of you. Half-life, you can save where ever you please and you may not need to because the computer auto saves at really well thought out points in the game. Finally this game is anything but linear. You can drive vehicals, vehicals with guns, take on big ships for a boss battle, kill zombies, kill combines(police/gaurd/army people), control these mosters to kill you enemys, fight along side ai controlled team mates, and take out snipers. You'll never get bored and feel that its getting tedious which is the thing that a lot of games suffer from. This is hands down the best action game of 2004, but I cant judge if its the best game because i have yet to get my hands on rome:total war. What more can I say than buy this game?...i could say "buy this game now!" but thatd sound too demanding...sooo...just, buy this game, you won't regret it	1
The title says it all. There is simply no aspect about the game itself that is lacking (the Steam bit is another story, but most of the posters have already commented on that; I intend to review the game itself). I found myself totally immersed and in shock of just how much detail and thought and depth they put into this game.  What sets it apart from other, more conventional games is this:  1. Graphics that will astound literally anybody (even today, years after the game's release. I still feel that HL2 has the best graphics in the history of video games). The physics engine still leaves me incredulous; everything is amazingly life-like in its reactions. Whatever would happen in real life, will 99% of the time happen in the game.  2. An excellent, followable and understandable plotline that engages the player, yet leaves some parts unanswered so that the player is begging to know more. You WANT to progress in the game so you can learn more about the story and what is to come.  3. The requirement for the player to use his head when it comes to the puzzle-solving that is as much of an integral part of the game as the combat. This is no mindless shoot-em-up flick!  4. The gameplay itself. The game is surprisingly easy and simple to learn and play, a great choice for new and veteran players alike. Although it will challenge all players, it is not difficult to the point of being frustrating and irritating.  In short, the people at Valve have created what can truly be called a masterpiece and an instant classic, a game that (once again!) redefined first-person-shooters forever. It truly is the best game ever made, bar none (until Half-Life 3 comes out!). Buy this and Episode One, which has even better graphics!	1
I am one of the few people who haven't played the first half life. Stupid huh? Buy the second one before playin the first. I read a review for HL2 in  PC gamer(they gave it a 98%)and that made me want to buy it. Now, I've played every FPS out there ok, Battlefield 1942 and Vietnam, The Unreal Tournament series, Doom 3, Far Cry, and so on, and none of them compare to the sheer overall glory that is Half Life 2. I believe the correct word is ownage?  Half Life 2 is maybe the best looking game ever made, no, wait, it is the best looking game ever made. But good graphics don't make good gameplay usualy, but thanks to the Havok 2.0 physics engine HL2 uses, it does. You can pick up the opressed peoples TV's and throw them out a window. Probably the greatist thing about HL2 is that physics. Being able to treat everything as "real" is the biggest step forward in a FPS.  The multiplayer is kick ass. It comes with the new Counter-Strike and Half Life 2 dethmatch. I would have liked more game modes for Half Life 2 dethmatch but thats what it is, "deathmatch". Either way, with the new Counter Strike, the multiplayer rocks.  Half Life 2 is also verry scalable. My friend has an average PC, 64 mb graphics card, 512 mb of memory, 1.2 ghz procesor, anf he can run HL2 on meduim graphics settings. You can run it all the way up if you have 128 mb of graphics memory, 512 mb of memory, and a 2.0 ghz procesor. You don't need a monster gaming rig like you need for Doom 3.  Half Life 2 rocks, but it has some problems, it is verry linear. You have to follow the path set for you. The vehicles are fun but the Dune Buggy is difficlt to drive.  Overall, Half Life 2 is sets the new benchmark for for all games, no matter what genre. No other game compares.  Concept- Be everything Half Life was and so much more.  Presentation- 9.7-The menu's are easy to use and they make sence.  Graphics- 10- From the physics to the wonderfull enviroments, HL2 is the best looking game to date, period.  Sound- 10 All the weapons sound great, and you will know with fear when you hear a Strider fire at you.  Playability- 9.6 The vehicles can be tough to drive, but other then that, its fun and eas to controll.  Entertainment- 9.9 Half Life 2 is my choice for Game of the Year 2004  Replay Value- 9.7-Counter Strike Source if fun as hell and Half Life 2 dethmatch is great	1
Just got this game and put in a couple hours last night.  Excellent graphics, excellent physics, smooth gameplay.  I particularly liked the realism of the other people and the "body" physics they use -- no more dead zombies falling into walls or laying horizontal on a slanted staircase, the interaction with the environment is perfect (just watch the way someone falls down a staircase...)  I had two problems, though:  1) Load times are too frequent.  Maybe I'm spoiled by RPG's that offer huge, seamless worlds, but I was annoyed at having to pause what seemed like every 10 minutes for "Loading".  If every RPG in the world can offer seamless loading of a huge environment, why can't HL2?  I'd gladly sacrifice some graphics if it meant they could do away with pauses to load between areas.  2) Gameplay was way too predictable.  Maybe I've just played too many FPS games, but HL2 was really formulaic.  There's only 1 path to take, any other path is just a deadend with supply crates, it felt very arcadish (as opposed to immersively realistic).  Like oh, the way is blocked!  Well, good thing someone left a big ramp here, which I can't use because it's not at the right angle, but luckily someone left just the right number of floating blue containers here that I can use the jack it up to the correct angle to make the jump!  I mean come on, okay, you have a nice physics engine, we get it, you didn't have to set up a time consuming yet completely obvious puzzle just to demonstrate the fact.  It was interesting in a "it's neat the physics engine can do this" sort of way, it was not interesting in a "this is a fun aspect of the game" sort of way.  I almost feel like I'm playing a demo moreso than a game.  Like they set things up to say "look what our engine can do" rather than setting out to create an awesome level that's fun and immersive to play.  So here's my advice to Valve:  Stop letting your programmers do level design.  Design levels that are fun and immersive and don't worry about whether or not every nuance of your physics engine is being demonstrated.  That's pretty annoying.	1
First let me say that you should not read any of the reviews that gave this game 1 star because of steam. Steam is an excellent idea; updates and patches download automatically, and you can play the game on any computer if you purchased it through Steam. Many people (like the person who wrote A two faced piece of garbage) gave this game 1 star because of Steam. In the case of "A two faced piece of garbage" it was because they have dialup. Many people had problems registering when HL2 first came out, but these issues have longe since been resolved. If you have a good internet connection then steam will not take "an HOUR to send information (just a username and password)". (By the way Metal Man, it helps when you're computer meets the system requirements on the box). And no, Steam does not "[boot] up for about 15 minutes every time you turn on your computer". Its a setting you IDIOT!! Uncheck the little box! Duh! And no, an Xbox version of this game is NOT coming out. This game on any console (consoles are aka wastes of money) would be horribly bad.  Now then, onto the game....  It is INCREDIBLE. The best FPS and probably the best game ever made to date. If I may quote the PCG review "it beats Doom 3 into the ground with its own flashlight". I don't think I can describe it any better. There is no aspect of this game that needs improvement. It is the closest thing to a perfect game I have ever seen. If you ever get bored of the single player and multiplayer (which also rocks) then there are MODS. Physics fun mods, singleplayer mods, multiplayer mods are all abundant on the internet. In a nutshell, this game is amazing so buy it NOW. As a final note to those who gave the game 1 star because of steam, DONT BASE YOU'RE GRADE OF THE GAME ON SOMTHING OTHER THAN THE GAME!	1
Okay...  so everyone has cracked open the wine and poored champaigne over themselves... the balloons are popping in the background... and hatfuls of confetti are being sprinkled in the air as we speak....  Does this sound like every review regarding Half Life 2...... ZZZZZP (Cassette pause!!!) Hold that thought, because Im a about to tell you... Half life 2 isn't the best game I've ever played.  Sure, its a great experience, with heaps of effects to delight all of the senses. Heck, they've even managed to put together a very atmospheric universe... There is certainly much to be impressed about.  But lets just stop for a second and look at what is wrong.  Firstly, its no rumour that STEAM (launching device for half life 2) is a Bast@rd of a program. It attaches to the lifeline of your computer like a trojan virus. It even manages to sneak in a few advertisements while its suspiciously working away... BROADBAND $25 a month... bahhhh what is this spyware..!?!. Folks, there is a reason why this program is called STEAM! Just have your extinguisher ready.  If your hoping to install this game in a few minutes... I can only laugh at what awaits you... Setup camp... because towards the end of the first hour of my installation conquest, I had to turn to God for salvation.... C'mon... please... C'monnnnnn!!!!!!!  So finally, the game starts booting... And with all the energy I'd put into it... I was hoping for a portal to open up. hehehe, the game begins.  So I hear that half life 2 had a budget of over $40 million.  The game begins much like the original. Stepping off a train Im immediately greeted by a world straight out of Total Recall... COOOOOL! If you love your futuristic depictions... Half life 2 is a fantastic addition.  As I move through the sequences, Im constantly driven by a need to know what is around the next corner. I got so caught up in the whole atmosphere, I started throwing bottles at the soldiers... to which they replied "Step BAck now!!!"  By all means this game is great!  However, As I proceeded through the levels, I beagan to notice a pattern. Have we really come along way in Half Life 2? It feels much the same as the original. Sure it has a storyline... but sometimes I felt like I was running after a train, running a very linear line. It DOES have a more advanced physics engine that DOES allow you to interact with the environment... but often these interactions still don't go beyond picking up, bashing\shooting or moving.  Two hours into the game, Im well entertained, but in the back of my mind, Ive grown tiresome of moving through dark rooms, bashing planks of wood and sniping off law enforcers. Its just alley way after alley way...door to door, tunnel to tunnel...?.??... Health pack... and move on.  And then we have the Multiplayer... which is non existent.  In the end... half life 2 feels like nothing more than a new generation FPS, with a few more inevitable technological advances.  Is it the best game Ive ever played... Is it another break through in pc gaming.... no its not. $40 millin dollar budget... I expect much more... a more immersive world (how many civilians do we come across?), with character development, and a more expansive plotline (sick of this go and find Mr. X business????). There are times when HL 2, for a short moment, comes close to this vision I speak of e.g. when the soldiers are raiding a room as I pass through a building. But that experience quickly falls flat on its face when I realise its purely scripted, and I cant change its fate.  In all honesty, I think HL2's immersive atmosphere isn't too far ahead of FAR CRY's.  Its character development is inferior to Deus Ex. Technically, CAll of Duty has a smoother multiplayer experience, and Fallout 2 (made 10 years ago) had more freedom.	1
I remember hearing a couple of years ago that 3 of my favorite games were to have sequels in the near future - Half Life, Deus Ex, and Doom.  They were all three supposed to come out at the same time, and my mind was spinning as to which I would purchase.  I was positive that the Deus Ex sequel would be my favorite.  Luckily, it was the first one to be released.  Unfortunately, it was released with a fizzle, and now the company that made it, Ion Storm, has closed down.  A couple of months later, we get our hands on Doom 3.  While still hugely popular, it has a lot of problems, and can barely run on most machines.  It looks pretty though.  Enter Half-Life 2 - it's what the other two games wished they could be.  The graphics in Half-Life 2 are the best I've ever seen.  The character models are unbelievably realistic.  The action is non-stop-balls-to-the-wall.  I remember playing the first Half-Life, and loved the way they linked all the levels together to seem like one big level.  Well, in this game, they have perfected this concept.  All the level transitions make perfect sense, and were it not for the loading times, you wouldn't even know it was another level.  I don't want to get into the story.. you should play it yourself, but I will say that this game is a treat to play.  It's exciting as hell, and it's got my vote for the best game ever made.  If you liked Half-Life, you'll love this sequel.  I want to mention Steam now.  I hate hate hate the idea of having to run a seperate application that connects to the internet just to play these games.  It's obviously a very controversial subject, but I should say that it was no problem at all to get it all up and running.  It took only half as long for Steam to decrypt the game files as it did to install the game.  I'm pretty sure that updating Counter Strike Source took way longer.  Anyway, now that it's up and running, I find Steam to be a convenient way to connect to the multiplayer Half-Life / Half-Life 2 games.  They're all listed right there in one little box, and can be played quickly and easily at the click of a button.  So, if you're holding off buying this because of what other users have said about Steam, then I say go ahead and buy it.  I think most of the negative hype around Steam is pretty overblown.  One more thing - there is a 3rd party mod for HL2 called HL2 Capture the Flag.  Get it!  It's awesome!	1
I'd rather give this a 4 1/2 stars, but that's not allowed. The graphics are great, the playability is great, I had great fun playing.  My only real big complaint is that it wasn't mentally challenging enough. Too many levels were just run and gun. Strip out the enemy, and you'd fall asleep. And while the gravity gun was fun--really fun--too many of the challenges were centered around it.  A minor complaint is the story is sometimes goofy or just stupid. I hated how some characters beat me to destinations--it made what I just did seem so pointless (without giving out spoilers why even have the entire middle of the game?)  Still, I can honestly say I haven't had this much fun playing a computer game in a long time. (And while playing other games, I still find myself thinking "if I had the gravity gun....")	1
I'll make this short and spare the details, the graphics are out of this world, the weapons are fun (not the same as before though), the AI is challenging and intelligent (except the zombies of course), the vehicles are fun (something that was lacking in the original halflife), and the storyline, (though predictable at times like most games), is good.  The only disappointment was that it's rather lacking in terms of "bosses" of any kind...instead there seems to be some seemingly insurpassable levels due to an overwhelming onslaught, but really no big and tough to kill new lifeforms like the giant spider or the final boss in Halflife 1.  Don't play on the easy setting if you have even average skill at these games, as you'll probably fly through.  Luckily if you get stuck, it allows you to change difficulties without starting a new game.	1
This game is absolutely phenominal.  I have to be honest, I didn't play much of the first Half-Life.  But regardless, this game has to be bought by any First Person Shooter fan, because this isn't just some run-of-the-mill first person shooter. This game didn't let down like Halo 2 did.(Sorry Halo junkies, I just thought Halo 2 was disappointing.) Half Life 2 has to be one of the best sequels created. I've seen a review that this game was "unoriginal". The Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator gun seems pretty original to me! Take that, blind critic!  Buy this game, it has to be in every gamer's library.  ...what are you still doing here? Go buy the game!	1
Within minutes of beginning Half-Life 2, it dawned upon me that much like its predecessor, "Half-Life," the game is truly revolutionary, not only for its astounding graphics engine but for its truly cinematic scope.  The plot is engaging and immensely beguiling. In Half-Life 1, the theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman, under the orders of his superiors, activated an interdimensional rift at the Black Mesa research facility situated in the desert. From the depths of the rift entered a race of aliens known as the Nihilant, which proceeded to lay waste to the facility and threaten humanity. Freeman entered through the rift and succeeded in destroying the homeworld from which the aliens originated. However, upon arrival at the Black Mesa Research Facility, the military engaged in a vicious cover-up involving the extermination of all survivors. In Half-Life 2, Gordon Freeman, having returned to Earth from the homeworld of the Nihilant, discovers City 17, an Orwellian nightmare in which the citizens have been completely subjugated by an authoritarian regime known as the Combine. Exacerbating the problem, the aliens released from Black Mesa now run amok in City 17. Fans of the original Half-Life will be pleased to learn that the characters Barry Calhoun and Dr Kleiner return from the original game and are leaders of a small band of resistance against the dictatorial regime.  Highly detailed and with the most impressive physics engine I have ever seen in a game, Valve has created an environment in which gravity plays a pivotal and incredibly important role. Examples of this include stacking boxes to climb over a fence or through a window or floating barrels to raise a platform. The vast cityscapes and highly detailed facial features of the main characters are of a level never seen before. Unlike any other game presently, the features of the characters are truly lifelike, with visible wrinkles, expressions and pores. Other than the mesmeric and plentiful eye candy, the captivating plot engages successfully with the gamer, and I found the experience exceedingly satisfying. The musical score is excellent and seamlessly changes from that befitting a brooding atmosphere to a sequence of first person shooter action. It augments the gameplay well, though there are times where the score could use more variation.  It is, however, in the area of gameplay that Half-Life 2 truly excels. While Gordon Freeman is never seen and never speaks, this hardly detracts from the experience. Effortlessly shifting from moments of intense suspense and tension to mind-blowing action, as a first person shooter, Half-Life 2 is excellent. Here I must return to the game's amazing (I'm running out of superlatives here) physics engine. Freeman can pick up objects and shift them around, but it is the gravity gun that makes this area of the game truly unique. Using the gravity gun (in the game this is also known as the Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator), Gordon Freeman can pick up objects and, with a single click, send them flinging away. Apart from being a handy tool in solving the game's many gravity-based puzzles, the practice of hurling barrels at unsuspecting zombies is quite gratifying!  My only gripe with Half-Life 2 is the annoying system by which one must connect to the internet and "log in" with Steam for the game to run. Apart from being intensely frustrating when notified that the servers are too busy to run the game, such an unwieldy system really eliminates those without an internet connection, and taints what would otherwise be an unbelievable addition to the Half-Life series.	1
I don't play too many games anymore as I don't find the time nor do many keep my interest for more than 1 or 2 gaming sessions.  This is one of those exceptional games that keeps me coming back.  Even after my busy schedule kept me from playing for a couple months I was able to jump right back in and have a blast.  The only other game that I can say that about is Diablo II.  It's a blast having these alien invaders attacking you from all sides and throwing flaming barrels at you while you're trying to swim/shoot/run.  The physics engine is fun as well, I'm always looking for another barrel to blow up just to see what havoc it will cause.  The divisions in the story also aid in the excitement and keep the game fresh as you get to try out new vehicles in new terrains and have to develop slightly different techniques.  Then there are even fun puzzles and I'm not much of a puzzle person (or at least not in video games).  If you enjoy any of the following I think you'll love this game: deep plotted stories, first person shooters, or racing games.	1
I will wait until all the bugs are ironed out on this game. I had trouble even running the demo so I gave up. It is NOT my systems fault either. I have a current system with current specs so the programers have NOT done a good job.	-1
As one of the 3 people in the universe who didn't much care for the original Half-Life, I was hardly awaiting with baited breath the release of this sequel.  The things I didn't like about the original, namely the clunky and flawed controls, dated graphics even for 1998, outweighed the undeniable genius of the game as a story.  I wasn't ruling out Half Life 2, but I was much more interested and looking forward to Doom 3.  Fast forward to the present.  Having just built myself a top-notch gaming PC capable of running both games with ease, I took the plunge, but decided to install and play Doom 3 first.  My initial reaction to that game --awe at the graphics and production value, creepy atmosphere-- was quickly replaced with tedium and boredom as the game played out like a 21st century scavenger hunt (find the key card!  Get lost in the dark!).  When I played Half-Life 2, however, I was BLOWN AWAY.  The graphics are as good as Doom 3, but the big difference is that you can actually see them, because the entire game is not in dark tunnels, but rather takes place over a variety of terrains, ranging from beautiful coastline to wonderfully post-apocalyptic cityscapes.  This game is truly deserving of all of the "Game of the Year" awards, and here is why:  GRAPHICS: Simply stellar.  The textures are terrific, and the water effects are super, second only to Far Cry.  The character models are very nicely done, and the way their eyes follow you around the room is both creepy and amazing.  SOUND: Very, very good.  The sounds and music are very well done, and complement the game's moods quite ably.  GAMEPLAY: A gift from heaven.  The game engine is ruled by physics so real, you're going to try picking up every object just to see what happens.  A brick feels and reacts different that a doll, a tire swing responds realistically to a push, and bodies fall convincingly when shot or falling.  The control is simple, smooth and effective, and the weapons are generally balanced.  I wish there had been a better sniping weapon than the crossbow, but hey, that's what mods are for!  STORY: Again, stellar.  It's so noticeable when a story grabs you, and when a story is just filler, a pretext for the setting of the game.  In Doom 3, I couldn't care less why I was there.  I certainly wasn't about to read the myriad boring PDA's you find on corpses, and the story is really trite.  Half-Life 2, much like Knights of the Old Republic, makes YOU the star of the game, and gives you little chunks of info, but never overwhelms you with random names that mean nothing to you.  As a result, you internalize the info, and actually come to care about the other characters.  The scripted scenes are always logical and never forced, and they are just plain funny at times.  I can't say enough about the great immersive world of this game.  NEGATIVES: Much like everyone, I dislike the "Steam" program which basically means that each time you play half life, you need an active internet connection.  It's the company's way of authenticating your software, and while it's logical to be paranoid, (after all, this game's code was famously stolen by a hacker last year) it's a bit much.  That said, most people have internet, so this is somewhat moot.  OVERALL: I personally don't care for online games; I find that people often act like children or jerks, and that the few games that are fun to play in multiplayer are shooters like Unreal Tournament of the Battlefield series.  I can't express enthusiastically enough how happy I am to see that a game developer still cares about putting out a polished and amazing single player game.	1
I have to say, I'm still hatin those who say that games have to work on my computer or it won't be a good one! Eg. How many times have you seen a review saying that "This game... don't buy it, won't work on your computer?!" I hate it, and if it don't work on your computer, you DON'T NEED TO WRITE A REVIEW ON IT.  Anyway, back to the point. Basically, the game has a pretty complex physics system ie you throw some bricks on a lever the lever will gradually tip over. The game is quite realistic as well. I remembered first time I played on Half Life I was soooo freaked out. And the same here. Level 6 "We don't go to Ravenholm" isn't for the faint-hearted. Pretty gruesome graphics. If you go to PC-gamer or some other review magazine they will tell you a LOT about the graphics system.  Oh, did I mention some added functions? Zombies who get sliced can stil attack you, so be careful. They don't give up easy. And headcrabs then drop off and hit you! Then you've got the great AI. If people tell you that the AI in Half Life is clever, they are wrong. 1. It's the programmers who are clever, because models couldn't attack and move at the same time. But they hid it! Here, the characters can intelligently negotiate terrain and take cover.  Yes, you can also have a group of characters following you who can fight, heal and give you ammo!  Don't get me to go through everything here, BUY IT. Oh, don't be too trusting with the specs. Fortunately for me I got the best computer I could get. Oh, and you MUST HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION TO REGISTER, EVEN FOR SINGLE-PLAYER!	1
Being a collector for over 10 years I own over 4000 PC games, from early DOS games (Abandonware now) to the latest recourse-gazling megamoths.  Let me tell you this: RARELY had I enjoyed a game More!!!  Walk, run, jump, float, drive, shoot, admire, listen,...have all your senses occupied by one of the best game ever! Absorbing atmosphere and interesting plot (well, OK, for a FPS game)!  Intuitive controls, natural AI, nice guns (the Gravity gun has influenced a great number of later games) - and GREAT CRISP GRAPHICS (even on medium-range machines).  I was tempted to award less than 5 stars because of the whole STEAM Connection blunder (which is totally inexcusable! VALVE, why do you punish honest buyers - you do know there is crack out there which does not need internet activation, don't you?). FAR CRY was more fun in the end because it is not hampered by STEAM. I think that VALVE is shooting its own game sales in the foot with this...I guess, time will tell.  Nevertheless, HL2 was so fun to play, I will not let STEAM fog it up.  You Will Enjoy It TOO !!!  RECOMMENDED!!	1
To tell you the truth I never finished Half-Life 1, even though it was considered a great game. It just never appealed to me. But upon seeing previews for Half-Life 2 I became intrigued. First of all the graphics looked amazing and second the action was second to none in any computer game I had ever seen. As the finish date got closer and closer I kept seeing more awesome movies of gameplay that included the gravity gun and the killer AI. I had become hooked. So when the game came out I sat down and did not leave my computer for a very long time. The graphics and atmosphere of the game drew me in and would not let go. And the action was awesome. The first sequence of the guards chasing you through the apartment buildings was tense and left me breathless. Not once after that did the action stop though, it just kept getting better and better. Apart from the action I did not enjoy the story as much. I felt rushed from one area to another not even knowing what was going on or why I was going against this evil white haired guy. So when I finished the game I was expecting an awesome cut scene to explain what had just happened, but the only thing it did was leave me thinking WTF? What the heck just happened? It did not explain anything and the last few words spoken by the wierd guy in your head were very cryptic. Now either I had to play the original and all the add-ons to understand this or maybe no one out there knows whats going on. I understand there will probably be a sequel in the making but to end a game like that, its just not good taste and kind of a letdown to all of us who shelled out hard earned money for this game. Now don't get me wrong I enjoyed every bit of it I was just expecting something more at the end, something to reward me for running through all the hard areas of the game, the spyders in particular. So thats why I gave the game 4 stars instead of the 5 that many people believe it deserved. I mean if it was like Painkiller in which you expected no story or explanation of events then I might have given it 5 stars. But now I want to check out Half-Life 1 and play it all the way through, maybe I will find the missing info.	1
Don't read this review if you want insight to the game.  I just had to let off some steam. Half-life 2, the game, rocks.  The graphics are amazing.  The gameplay is excellent.  The story, a little retread, but still intoxicating.  My problem is the game system valve put as a gatekeeper for the game -- ie steam.  It took me four hours to get the game loaded.  If it had been any, and I mean ANY, game other than halflife 2 I would have gotten a refund.  Steam is well named.  It is that smell that rises from the machine as it loads (so painfully slowly).  I hope someone from Valve (or any other game software company) reads this.  I don't appreciate spending $55 to be jerked around.  I just want to play the game.  If the anti piracy software is too doggone difficult for the buyer--We'll just go to another game company that doesn't abuse the people sending our money.	1
I have to tell you, I never played such a great game.  Heres why you should get this game.  I think that the best thing about this game is the graphics and the physics. Heres the score I gave Half Life 2:  Gameplay: 9/10 - Always somthing to do and it doesnt get boring. Also amazing physics.  Graphics: 10/10 - Best graphics ever made, everything is so realestic that feels like your in the game.  Sound: 9/10 - Great sound, you hear echoes, alos if you smash wood you will actuly hear a wood sound, everything has realstic sound and great music, only the music is short.  Value: 10/10 - Definetly worth the value because basicly you get 3 games in one pack, Half Life 2, Counter Strike: Source, and Half Life 2: Deathmatch.  So to get to my point its an awsome game and you should definetly get it. But know this, you do need an internet connection. (even if you want to play single player) And you need to register an account on Steam, but its free.  Well I hope this review has been helpful.  Also if you want to know this, there has being a rumor that Valve is planning to make Half Life 3.  So remember get the game, you won't be dessipointed.	1
That was the best! I was completely hooked and up until 2AM many times because I could not quit. I had to see what was next.  The graphics, the sound, the scripting, the story, the weapons, the indoor/outdoor environments, the vehicles, the battles, the puzzles, the weird semi-organic creature/ships, the striders, the great map design where the path/solution was not always obvious. Then there was the water effect; that alone was worth the $50.00  The only disappointment was that the last level was too easy and the end too vague. I was hoping for a grand revelation and I would have preferred that it ended on a tougher note, with a more challenging puzzle and an end that made me wonder whose side I was really on.  Awesome game. They left the door open for Half Life 3. I hope it is not another 5 years though.	1
I received a copy of Half Life 2 for Christmas. I have been waiting for this game to be released for two years. Yep, we have all been through the "our ideas were stolen...yada...yada...yada..." I was appalled to discover that in order to load the game, I had to sign up for an account on-line!!!! Sure, they "SAID" you could play the game off-line once you signed up BUT what kind of "stronged arm robbery" is this!?! You HAVE to sign up for their on-line crap that you DO NOT want OR need?!?! Valve AND Sierra should be hung and quartered for this blatant ripping off of the public. Now...IF you can swallow all that BS and decide to try the game for all its hipe, you will quickly discover that Sierra and Valve released the game on FIVE CD'S!!!! Who on God's green earth puts out a game as a multi-swap CD anymore?!?! One darn DVD would have handled the complete game. Okay, so you play the CD swap only to find out that their is a crucial file missing at the end of the 4th CD. Oh, did I mention the craptacular box AND no manual?!?!  I did not bother to return the game. I threw it in the trash where it, and all other games like it, belong. It is a shame that I never got to experience any of the game itself. Maybe the companies will release a non rip off version on DVD, that actually loads AND that has a hard copy of the manual!  You know, there was a time when Sierra games were to die for...KIng's Quest series...Phantasmagoria, etc...BUT no more :( [...]	-1
Five Stars for the game fun factor if you can eventually get it loaded and bugless but unfortunately really deserves the one star overall because of the horrible, horrible installation requirements and because of many awful installation specific bugs that grossly interfere with game play.  The game itself truly is excellent, with the graphics, game play, controls all setting new standards. I personally don't like the plot and setting as much as the first Half Life and find it unnecessarily dark and depressing and I thought the ending was a little abrupt and unsatisfying, but in comparison with Doom 3 it is really a fun romp. Truly a great game.  As to the really bad part. I am a computer programmer and have half a dozen assorted computers. I spent 16 hours trying to get a working install on My new XPS with PCI express buss and 256mb ATI ultra video board. The Steam On line install system is a mess!!!! First it insists on installing Steam, then an update (over one hour on Dial up), then decrypting another hour plus. then registering and the list goes on. Then when it's done it doesn't work. I get a disk not installed message. So OK go to steam and planet half life web site and look at bug FAQs I find one that tells me if I get this message I need to uninstall my Sonic DVD driver and reinstall Half Life 2. I don't really want to remove my Sonic Driver, but I do and way and spend another four hours reinstalling Half Life. This time, up comes the starting half life 2 message, but half life 2 never comes up either on or off line. So I go back and look at the rest of the FAQs, all 170 of them, NONE of which cover my problem. I try one more remove and reinstall of Half Life 2- four more hours. Same result. Finally give up and go and install it on my old Dell Inspiron Lap top four more hours. Works perfectly Play game in standard mode and works perfectly. But wait there's more. On a hunch I try a remove and reinstall one more time on my XPS system four more hours, this time removing Steam as well as Half Life 2 first and it works fine and I play it through on Hard mode and it is HARD. You'd think I'd be done now, but no there's more. I though I'd play the redone Half Life Source through on hard mode since I'd only originally done it in standard mode and it should have been all installed when I installed Half Life 2 right, wrong , three more hours installing Half Life Source and it works, well, sort of. Each time you start the game it works fine for the first ten or fifteen minutes, then it starts taking little fifteen second breaks (picture and sound freeze) every minute or two. After another ten minutes or so, the breaks stretch to 30 seconds and after another ten or fifteen minutes they stretch to 45 seconds, eventually reach more time frozen than playing (within an hour of starting each time. I sort of recall from the FAQs that there is a fix dealing with this that is accomplished by disabling the advanced stereo features of your sound card and you guessed it reloading all of Half Life 2 and Source from scratch again, but some how that wasn't too appealing to me any more so I played it through in hard mode as it was freezes and all. Half Life Source is still low poly but appears to be substantially improved over the original Half Life and is really quite hard in Hard mode.   Last level Half Life Source strategy. For the Nihilanth, go into the level with your rocket launcher armed and take out the 3 crystals on the wall before you are dumped to the ground then immediately run behind the spiky rock nearest the wall and snipe at fatheads head and brain till he dies. In hard mode getting hit with the white balls is equivalent to instant death and the green ball sends you to a really unfriendly space avoid them both at all costs. Skip the jump onto the ledge thing in this version.  The games are both great, but Valve has made such an utter hash of the installation procedure and of leaving in totally unacceptable bugs that they should be boiled in oil or stuck in with their own Nihilanth. They have made this mess because of getting their code ripped off last year and are making their paying customers now pay for their own stupidity then. I would really like to see a Half Life 3, but at this point, I would really prefer to see Valve go broke instead.  A final thought is skip the limited edition, it is truly not worth it. The supplied Prima Guide is a joke only covering the entry to the game and is really an add for Prima guides I wouldn't use one anyway and the supplied shirt is uninteresting in the extreme. The DVD ROM Version is the only thing of value that is supplied and it isn't worth thirty bucks more than the CD version.	-1
I really enjoyed the original Half-Life game, and was very excited about the sequel.  I recently upgraded my PC, got a top of the line video card, and couldn't wait to try out the new engine.  Luckily, I waited till the demo came out, and ran that first.  There are two chapters in the demo.  The first is chapter one, where you (as Gordon Freeman) arrive at City 17 on a train.  You wander around a nearly deserted train station, and see some very impressive graphics and digital actors.  They still look pretty polygonal, but they are a lot more realistic than anything else out there.  Facial expressions, the whole bit.  They ain't Gollum, but still, very impressive.  There's a very eerie feeling in the train station.  The emotional impact is quite strong.  Something horribly wrong has happened, and you are in some kind of relocation station.  A PR film runs over and over telling you that this is one of the few remaining cities...  Remaining after what? you wonder.  As a big science fiction fan, I was immediately drawn in.  After encountering a bud from the first HL, I manage to escape the station, and find myself in an open plaza.  This plaza was just amazing in its photorealism.  You can almost tell what time it is just from the lighting and atmosphere--it is that real.  Soon, though, the chapter ends as you enter a building.  The other chapter in the demo is chapter 6.  Now you are much further in to the story, you've got a gun, and it's dark. There are some very impressive crows in a yard, flapping and cawing. Wow. (Sounds dull, but you have to see it.  So real!)  But there are also...lots of body parts and blood strewn around.  Corpses of people who seem to have died in extreme agony.  Skin ripped off their bones.  A torso cut in half, hanging from a tree.  At this point, I lost interest in the game.  This video world I have entered has convinced me quite solidly of its reality, and now I am presented with some very realistic, believable, stomach-turning horror.  I had no wish to be here any longer. I could not feel anything but pity for the poor souls lying dead around me.  I did not feel that killing anything that moved was going to help anyone.  I shut down the game and deleted it off my system.  If you've gotten this far in my review, you may be surprised to know I like shooters.  I just completed Thief 3.  Wonderful game.  You rely on your cunning and skill.  However, it did bother me a bit that it's "me against the world" in Thief.  Can't trust anybody, and there's no remorse when you have to kill somebody to achieve a goal.  What I liked about Thief more was its "adventure" side, more than its shooter side.  I'm intrigued by the MMOG phenomenon, though I haven't tried any of them.  But I'm intrigued by the idea that people (strangers, no less) get together in these games and cooperate to accomplish a goal.  And they enjoy exploring vast video worlds.  I think eventually we'll see an adventure game (like Myst) that is as highly rendered as HL2, allowing the interaction Myst currently lacks.  It will be gorgeous to look at, convincing in its reality, and it will have an interactive storyline (with you as the protagonist) that involves more than simply making your way through a maze (such as a building complex, yawn) filled with zombies and monsters.  You can see the interest in such a game based on the success of "The Longest Journey", the Sims, and the Myst series and its clones.  When I want to play, I want to pretend I can save the world, sure.  But not by shooting everything in sight.  The encouraging thing about playing this demo was that it showed the potential video games have now.  I'm looking forward to the day a developer with imagination takes this technology the next step forward.	-1
I found the first "Half Life" and the following two expansion packs interesting to play, but the degree of violence rampant throughout the series was a constant hamper to their overall enjoyment. In many portions the action went beyond "realistic" into ridiculously gruesome. The game would have been just as good without all the extra blood and guts. The storyline, action, adventure, and game engine were what made the original "Half Life" an exceptional gaming experience, not the extreme violence.  Sad to say, "Half Life 2" picks up where the original version left on and dramatically pumps up the level of objectionable content. To be quite honest, I'm surprised no one else here has picked up on this. The content is pure trash. Instead of thriving on level design or even story, the game relies heavily on the shock value of gruesome violence. So severe is the level of such content that you have to wonder if the designers intentionally crafted it to be purely sadistic. Let's be realistic about this, folks. Over-the-top violence is not cool. It's not innovative. It's not for "mature audience only." It's time we realized mature people don't go in for such filth.  Granted, the "Half Life 2" physics engine is incredibly well designed, but that alone is hardly reason to plunk down $50 for the game. A few months down the road, all first-person style games will have the same advancements, and many of these won't contain such sordid content. Personally, I'll be investing my money in games that provide great graphics, challenge, and gripping storylines, but do not contain such objectionable content. Look around. There are plenty of such games available. Why waste your money on pure filth?  I hate to think what kind of damage this game is doing to impressionable young kids, who are undoubtedly its biggest market right now. And its affect is not reserved just for children. No adult human being with an intelligence quotient above room temperature could continually expose him or herself to such content without being negatively affected. It might not manifest itself in actual violence, but the influence on our minds and souls will still be there. Sure, we all know it's fake, but if we continually allow sordid images into our minds we will inevitably be desensitized to them altogether. We will find it more and more difficult to practice such traits as compassion and self-discipline in real life.  The safest bet: Avoid this game altogether. There are countless other titles, including those in the first-person shooter genre, that provide the same benefits as "Half Life 2." It's about time we told the game industry enough is enough. Use your money wisely and avoid this trash.	-1
Amazing game. That's the easiest and most accurate way to put it. Out of all my friends, I was the first to get HL2 and beat it.  Having played all the way through, I must say this is one of the most amazing FPS ever created. When the Doom 3 hype storm hit last summer, I was at the fore-front of the salivating D3 mob.  But as we all know, Doom 3 fell on its face.  Half life 2 rode in on a similar hype tide, but delivers in every way imaginable. This is the game of the year.  Bar none.  Having played a lot of FPS, I'm a pretty harsh judge when it comes to rating a game's overall playability.  But with Half life 2, there is no need to second guess or make excuses. - This game is as good as it gets.  You resume the roll of Gordon Freeman; our beloved crowbar wielding warrior scientist.  HL2 continues the story of its predecessor, but in much better scope and detail as Valve's vision is fully realized with modern graphics and superb gameplay.  The graphics in this game are breathtaking.  Despite the Source engine's noticeably detrimental 'stutter,' Half life 2 is flawless in presentation.  And also, the real world physics in HL2 are unprecedented.  The actual gameplay, from solving puzzles to killing Combine forces, revolves very much around the realistic physical world that Valve has created here. And also, you get a nice long fulfilling story for your buck.  Unlike the premature endings of supposed breakthrough shooters like Halo 2, Half life 2 plays its story out to its fullest. - Making this sequel's wait well warranted.  Half life 2 advances the HL universe with its awesome, thought churning storyline.  Many of the foggier parts of the first game come into focus here, and the HL franchise is set up for many more satisfying sequels.  When it comes to negative things to say about HL2, I'm kinda at a loss.  HL2 will meet your every expectation and surpass it.  This game is indeed forerunning any of the great FPS to come.  Half life 2 has set a new bar for FPSs to reach.  With a great story, superb gameplay, unprecedented realism in graphics, and all around FPS fun, HL2 has claimed a place at the top of all FPS titles. This is a game that should not be missed.	1
hailed as possibly the greatest game ever, HL2 lives up to great standards. people bitch and moan about steam, but its probably because they are retarded. Steam is just the engine that games like Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, and Counter-Strike run on. ITS NOT HARD TO USE AT ALL. Also you get Counter-Strike with your purchase of HL2. Some fun times online. Amazing graphics and ground-breaking physics. BUY NOW.	1
Have played lots of these types of games this is not worth your money.	-1
I have had a horrible experience with this game.  I hate Valve now, and will not buy another game from this company.  I have wasted a whole day trying to play this game.  There are several problems.  1) Tremendous load time.  It took nearly an hour to load (AFTER the installation process was over).  2) STEAM (may the company rot in hell) is required in order to play the game.  You have to register with them before you can play HALF LIFE 2.  By the way, they also took over my original HALF LIFE game.  I can't play that one now either even though this morning before installing HL2 I had no problems.  My system is a Pentium 4 1.6 Gigahertz system with 512 Megs of Ram and oodles of hard drive space.  I have a killer All In Wonder video card.  That's well within the minimum specs of this game, but the darn thing seems to choke on HL2.  Please, save your money and time and get another game.  I wish that I had.  Upate:  12-16-05:  Everything I said above still stands.  That's how much I dislike this game.  Please, buy FEAR instead.	-1
Slots from Bally Gaming is extremely fun (AND INEXPENSIVE). This has many of Ballys 9 Line Video Slots with Bonus screens, including POPEYE, BLONDIE DOUBLE FEATURE, MOVIE STAR BETTY (Boop), CASH ENCOUNTERS, PERLY GATES, SOAP OPERA, THE HEIST, GOLD MINE, ISLAND WINS, PRIENCE OF PERSIA, MOO MONEY, and also the Bonus Spin FREE BEE, CREAZY CLOWS and DOUBLE DRAGON. ALL of these games are a blast. The Disk also includes 10 or so of the run of the Mill Slots; like Blazing Sevens, Las Vegas, Stars and Bars, etc., The slots are run of the mill but OK, but all the 9 Line Bonus games, as mentioned above, are extremely fun. This is a must get for slot lovers, the only negative is you have to put the disk in to initialized the game every time you play. even still IT ROCKS!!!  I just ordered Bally Slots 2, I can't wait to get it!!!	1
Masque really shines with this game. These Bally machines are top of the line and play very realistically. I love the Millionaire 7's collection of machines and the video titles such as Popeye and Soap Opera. Very good graphics. The only disappointment with this is the large variety of older games that are hard to find in casinos today. Looks like they were thrown in to fill space. Other than that, it's a good game to have. One thought: the Monte Carlo game is not the same as in the casinos. I contacted Masque and they replied that the info they have from Bally was the machine that was designed for the CD. Obviously, it's not. Anyway...until next time, go hit a jackpot.	1
Yeah, its more of the same of the excellent Slots II game.  An even mix of video and reel; the same great quality sound and graphics. So if you liked Slots II, (read all reviews); you'll love this one.  And especially if you are a fan of 9 -  line 5 reel Video slots.  All the latest from Bally that came out last year. You won't go wrong.	1
Just like the first Half-Life game, this one pushes the gaming industry forward.  All new FPS will have to step up to match the game play and graphics of this game.  Noticed some negative feedback left here on Amazon, but if you want the truth just visit a few video gamer sites - EVERY SINGLE ONE gives Half-Life 2 top honors.	1
While shopping, browsing or whatever on some Internet site, the site told you to make your PC wide-open to it, to grant it supreme access to do whatever it wants to do, wheneverit wants to. What would you think? What would you do? Well, that's what it takes to install and run Half Life2.  You might do the above to allow Microsoft LiveUpdate to patch your PC or Norton to upgrade your Anti-Virus software but a game site? Be warned to play this game you just about have to sell your soul to Valve and Steam. After loading the 5 software disks, you will be spending the next 1 to 8 hours (based on my and friends experience) creating a Steam account and having Steam set up hl2 - if you can. While this is all going on, your PC is sending God know what back to Steam and Steam is returning the favor to your PC. All this so you can finally play the game that you paid big $$$ for.  Here's some helpful hints from Steam and Steam forums to fix what is obviously your problem - you need to open ports.....through your firewall, you need to disable Norton Script Blocking, you need to grant Steam "GOD" rights to your PC, Anti-Virus software? Obviously that's the problem. Turn it off! These are being presented like they are your problems or Norton's or Zone Alarm.  Worse, gamers are complaining how horrid it is that Norton should cause them all this trouble! Does anyone besides me see something terribly wrong here?  Do yourself favor - pass on this one. It's a good game but not a great game and certainly not good enough to warrant the trouble and risk you are going to take. You may be doing others a favor too. If the Half Life / Steam way of doing business becomes prevelant, PC Gaming is doomed. I absolutely will never purchase another game that forces me to go through all this again and expose my PC to the risk. If every game company starts doing this, I'm done with PC games. It's back to reading and music. I might even pay some attention to the wife who gets little now because I play too many PC games!  One last comment - I assume that all the folks giving Half Life2 4-5 stars are either 12 year kids or are completely computer illiterate or are gamming zombies who will put up with almost anything to play hl2. If your none of these, I can't say little enough about you. If I tried, Amazon probably wouldn't publish this. Any adult who bought this game and attempts to install it, will realize they have been had and try to get their money back if they can.  ..............Uninstalling Steam  ..............Uninstalling HalfLife2	-1
The long awaited sequel to one of the most memorable FPS games ever is finally here.  Does the new game live up to it's lofty predecessor?  In many ways, HL2 is a tour-de-force of single player gaming.  From the movie-like flow of the story to the great physics algorithms, there are few games today that can purport the variety and quality of interactivity achieved in the game.  Players can choose from a wide range of weapons as well as using the game environment itself to defeat enemies and to advance further, all the while feeling like they are the main character of a big-budget Hollywood film.  Part of the success of HL2 is owed to the fantastic "Source" graphics engine used.  NPC character models are beautiful with expressive faces that have the added novelty of following your character around the room while addressing you.  Environments are realistic and there are many neat effects that run well even on an average gaming rig (though more powerful systems will obviously benefit the most).  Audio is very well done with an amazing amount of dialog (almost too much in some cases) and appropriate ambient sounds to enhance the atmosphere.  There are plenty of moments where you'll definitely feel the adrenaline rush in heated situations.  Controls are solid, although the added feature of picking up objects and using the mouse to position an item to a location you need to put it can be a bit tricky at times.  There are also the requisite jumping/balancing-on-narrow-ledges scenarios which can be frustrating to those that don't like that sort of thing.  Overall, there is a good enough balance to the level design such that you aren't always doing the same thing over and over every time.  If you are a fan of FPS, especially single-player ones, HL2 will be at the top of your list of "must have" titles.  All this gaming goodness does come at a cost, however.  One of the most noticeable issues is the very long load times.  As if installing the game wasn't tedious enough, from the very first time you start playing, and then subsequently throughout each stage of the game, be prepared to test your patience.  Another issue is Steam, Valve's answer to resisting software piracy.  In order to even get up and running you will need an Internet connection to authenticate the game over Valve's online gaming network.  This can take an inordinate amount of time depending on your bandwidth, system speed, and the status of the servers on Valve's end.  While I completely respect a software publisher's need to protect it's intellectual property, Steam is incredibly inconvenient and clumsy--especially in light of the now-infamous incident where HL2 code was stolen over the 'Net, partly through the haphazard security polices of Valve's own employees.  Finally, there is a rather gaping hole in the missing Multiplayer component.  While the regular edition of the game does come with an upgrade to CounterStrike (albeit a cosmetic one), there is really no HL2 multiplayer.  That appears to be an area that Valve is going to charge players extra for, a shame really.  Gripes aside, HL2 is easily one of the best titles of 2004 and that is saying something in a year that saw Doom3, Halo2, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, just to name a few.  So here's the rundown:  Pros:  Awesome Source engine graphics and physics  Immersive atmosphere and movie-like storyline  Challenging, yet creative level designs/interactivity  Runs well even on average game rigs  Cons:  Long load times  Scenes that break from the action to further story are long and verbose  Linear story that will hinder replayability  No HL2 multiplayer/deathmatch  Steam	1
Half-Life 2 is a great game, no doubt about that.  But Steam just about ruins it.  Steam tells you when you can play or not.  Steam will attach itself to your computer like a virus, update when it feels like it, and decide to crash when it feels like it.  All I'm trying to do is play the single player campaign for a game that I paid $55 bucks for.  But this is the 4th time this week that I'm unable to play, because the servers on Steam's side (nothing wrong with MY OWN COMPUTER) decided to choke and I can't play.  If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.  How they paired the greatest game with the worst idea ever to hit the gaming community, I don't know.  Their explanation:  Stop piracy? What, at the cost of "legitimate" customers like me that actually go out and buy the game?  Now more people who actually bought the game are looking for hacked version just so they can play the game they already paid for.  Sounds like a farce to me.  Do yourself a favor and boycott all Steam products lest it become a standard for the future gaming, which would be a total nightmare...	-1
I can't think of a PC game in recent history that was more anticipated then the sequel to Valve's blockbuster, Half-Life.  Early reports indicated that this game would indeed change many aspects of the gaming community such as physics and character models.  When it was released in November my excitment was only matched by my disbelief that it had actually come out, mostly due to the fact the game had been delayed on again off again for nearly 5 years.  So, was it worth the wait, worth the tedious Steam installation and frustration? Yes.  Let's start with the storyline, which is second to none, and due to my hatred of spoilers I'm only going to give you the basics.  You return from your odd state of limbo to find yourself (Gordan Freeman) in a scary, totaltarian controlled city known as City 17 run by a group called the Combine.  What ensues is your involvement in a resistance movement, which will take you everywhere from the city streets to desert wastelands.  The characters you meet are simply incredible, each one has their own deep personality with voice acting that could just as well be featured in a motion picture.  You'll feel a certain attachment to protect those who fight with you, and a loathing for your enemy who are as vile as they are mysterious.  Enemy AI is a little bit dissapointing from what was promised to us by Valve.  While they aren't stupid by a longshot, AI from other recently released PC games can match and even surpass it.  For instance, taking something like a small soup can and holding it in front of your face to use as "cover" will cause nearly all enemies in the area to cease fire and attempt to flank.  Even more ridiculous are their predictable combat methods which are as follows: take cover, throw a grenade, charge in, repeat.  By the end of the game I could have taken combine forces on with my eyes closed and speakers on full blast.  However, they will still challenge you, kill you and frustrate you, don't count them out, just don't expect true artifical intelligence.  A majority of the game you are on foot, however 2 levels allow you to pilot both a hovercraft like boat and an off road dune buggy, adding an incredible element of fun and variation.  Your arsenal will allow you to call on everything from standard pistols to the jaw dropping gravity gun, which allows you to pick up and throw objects such as chairs, cans, metal shelves and more as if they were mere pieces of paper.  The games graphics are gorgeous, beautiful, jaw dropping, the list goes on and on.  Without a doubt they are the best graphics so far for any game ever released, to say they have set a new standard would be an understatement.  Characters express emotions through facial features, enemy vehicles are detailed down to the last decal, even the infamous G-man's pores can be made out in the opening scene of the game.  The multiplayer scene is why many people bought the original Half-Life in the first place, and this trend is continued with the second one.  Half Life 2 Deathmatch, a recently released (free) add on by Valve, allows to to participate in standard free for all or team based battles on most of the games maps, fun but not in depth.  For those of you who want to experience everything this game has to offer, look to the now corporate backed mod community which has spawned games such as Counter-Strike and Day Of Defeat.  Using the Half-Life 2 engine these mods allow a whole new immersion in these already great games, CS Source is available for free with the purchase while DoD Source will be released at a later date requiring a purchase for those who only bought the base edition.  Does it live up to it's predecessor? Yes and then some, in fact it makes it's predecessor look like a joke in comparison.  It has all the elements of a great game, and a few minor bugs and issues aside, it is near perfection.  Don't miss out on this game, I say that often, but trust me...do not miss out on Half-Life 2, you'll regret it.	1
For the first half of this game, I was ready to anoint it the best action game ever made.  Everything just works so well.  The gameplay is perfectly balanced, the mystery in the story builds, and everything seems perfectly tested so that it works just right.  All of the additions that the game makes to the genre are ingenious.  Then, about 2/3 of the way through, the game loses some steam.  The level design takes a step backwards to 1998 in some areas.  Other times, gameplay elements don't work very well.  Finally, the story ends without answering anything, making you wonder whether there is going to be any resolution for what seems like a bunch of senseless plot twists.  Half-Life 2 is the most incredible looking game ever made.  It blows away Doom 3, and is still easily better looking than Far Cry.  Everything in the game looks amazing. The characters look, move, and act so life-like.  The water almost makes you thirsty looking at it, and each of the game's enemies are loaded with detail.  The new alien enemies that you meet about halfway through the game are particularly impressive, and the gigantic striders are simply unbelievable.  City 17 is a strange mix of beauty and despair.  I have never played a game that so perfectly captures an atmosphere like this.  Imagine what a rundown Eastern European city would look like in a futuristic totalitarian state ravaged by mayhem, and you have it in this game.  Towards the end of the game, when you are fighting through bombed-out, war-torn and flaming buildings, you have to occasionally stop to marvel at the carnage.  Valve really hit a home run when it comes to atmosphere.  Half-Life 2 adds a lot to the original game.  There are a couple of long vehicular sequences, some squad-based combat, a handful of new and interesting enemies, but most of all, physics.  No PC game has integrated physics this well into the gameplay.  The gravity gun is certain to be imitated by lots of other games.  With it, you can pick up all sorts of objects in the environment and use them as shields or weapons.  After playing through the game almost twice now, I can tell you that ripping a radiator off the wall and flattening an enemy with it never gets old.  Neither does launching an exploding barrel at a group of enemies and watching them fly across the screen.  The game also has some physics-based puzzles, which aren't that much of a highlight.  With the exception of one significant stuttering bug, the audio for Half-Life 2 is unforgettable.  Everything in the game sounds so - cool.  Every sound will implant itself firmly in your memory.  The radio chatter and AI barks of the combine, the whirling of the manhack blades, the horrible moan of the headcrab zombies, the sounds of the gunship machine guns, the hum of the gravity gun, the resounding crack of the 357 magnum, the screeches of the ant lions, and the "thump-thump" that the striders make as they plow through the city.  Half-Life 2 also has some great voice work to go with its wonderful sound effects.  Level design, for the first 2/3 of the game, is brilliant.  The game is pretty tightly scripted and doesn't deviate too far from the formulas of lots of other first-person shooters.  Health and shield power-ups are places just enough to make the game forgiving without making it too easy.  The game throws a variety of exciting challenges at you and doesn't get too frustrating or annoying.  In particular, the hover boat level is a nonstop thrill ride, and the Ravenholm chapter is like a survival horror game on crack.  But after that, you start to run into some areas that become either annoying or just aggravating.  It starts with the dune buggy level, which features horrendous controls.  You will spend more time upside-down in the buggy than you will spend driving it.  Then there are some annoying physics puzzles.  Three times, the game throws a puzzle at you that requires you to build some sort of bridge over a hazardous terrain using objects in the environment.  These sequences all interrupt the action, they are too long, and they aren't fun.  There are also some "avoid setting off the turret" puzzles near the end that are outdated and shouldn't have been in this game.  A couple of defensive missions require you to set up automated turrets, which are easily knocked over and seemingly impossible to get standing back up again.  These sequences are indescribably aggravating, as you helplessly try to get your turrets upright while your enemies blast away at you.  The squad-based portions of the game are unsatisfying. The squad is either fodder or just gets in your way in the game's tight corridors.  If you have a squad, a single strider will cut it down in about five seconds, so it's pointless to try to keep them alive.  The game still has encounters that require you use the knowledge that you gain by quick saving to get through them.  If you ask me, games like Far Cry and Halo have made this type of encounter obsolete.  Half-Life 2 is somewhat longer than your average action game.  It took me over 15 hours to complete it the first time, and it has so much to see and do that you can go back and replay it immediately.  I loved Half-Life 2, but some of the parts at the end left too much of a lukewarm taste in my mouth to call it Game of the Year.	1
The original Half-Life was a great game and this sequel is even better. The graphics are really fantastic, even on my low end system. My PC barely meets the minimum requirements but still gives beautiful graphics and fast action sequences. It also requires a fair amount of strategy to win, beyond just shooting everything you see. My only complaint, which isn't about game quality, is the "Steam" feature. It could have been better explained in the documentation. I had to install the game twice before I got it right. At first glance it appears that you have to subscribe to an online game service to get it to run, but that turns out to be not true. You do have that option, but it runs fine as a stand alone, single player game. To me it is much better than "Doom 3".	1
Striders, mechanical monsters with tall telephone-pole legs patrol the streets, prepared to skewer insurgents. As if anyone was willing to stand up to the planet's oppressors.  Some have sold out to the off-world fascists, and clips of the frighteningly calm turncoats play throughout cities to further pacify the populace. Impulse and instinct, they insist, are a plague. The visitors, according to the old sci-fi chestnut, are our friends. A mere 10 minutes in, and the latest Half-Life sets its atmosphere with convincing, blood-curdling aplomb. More so than any other game (Halo 2 included), it puts you in the head of its hero, and gets better as you go along. You are Gordon Freeman, science geek turned savior, and you're more than happy to doff the lab coat and lodge a crowbar (or a pistol slug, or shotgun shell, or crossbow bolt--you get the picture) in whoever deserves it. But of all the tools of the E.T.-go-home trade, the gravity gun is your silver bullet. Able to lift and launch whatever you like, it turns debris into lethal weapons and the shooter status quo upside down. The way things fly, catch fire, and fall not only carries consequences that add weight to your war of the worlds, but also creates situations that reward guile, guts, and instinct. Sometimes one broken beam produces better results than a magazine of bullets when the catwalk it supports collapses and crushes your foes.  The enemy is smart too, maybe more so than in any other shooter. They'll chase you down as you dash for cover; pin you with fire, then put pressure on your flank. Their helicopters hunt you through warehouses, open up as you pass windows, and blast the roof to bits to get a bead on you. It's remarkable really. In fact, everything about Half-Life 2 is remarkable. First-rate audio effects capture the sounds of spent cartridges clanking on the floor, rifle shots reverberating off walls, and head crabs hissing in corners. Levels range from canals to cemeteries, coastal highways to crowded cities, sewage systems to state penitentiaries, science facilities to strange fortresses--each lifelike and with a feel of its own. Some place you behind the wheel in sweet, plow-suckers-into-street-pizza sections, others put you in charge of fellow freedom fighters and bloodthirsty, bear-sized bugs that eat lead for lunch and ask for seconds (think Pikmin, but with lethal aliens instead of lovable plant people). Gameplay, graphics, you name it, it's top notch. On its own, Half-Life 2 is everything you asked for. And that's only the half of it. Depending on the package you pick, you also get the original Half-Life along with cyber-caf staples Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat, all redone with today's technology. Consider those expensive PC parts paid for in full.	1
I was amazed to pay as much as I did for HL2 and spent 2 weeks trying to get it to run.  The first surprise came when I attempted to install the game and found out that I must do so online and create an account with Steam.  Once done, there was a LONG wait for automatic game unlocking and updates.  Once all that was done, the problems began.  After about 1 more week of tweaking my system with the help of Steam, Valve, and teckies on the internet(which already has 512MB RAM, ATI Radeon 9200, and 80GB hard drive), I finally got to play the game.  This game did not disappoint. Poor Gordon Freeman!  After that nasty business at Black Mesa, he finds himself dragged into yet another horrible situation! The missions were varied, with lots of interesting elements.  For example, you can lead a squadron of soldiers or you need to keep someone alive as they complete a mission.  There are puzzles throughout that make this not just a shoot 'em up game, but a thinking gamer's game.  There are new characters and enemies, so there isn't that been-there- done-that feeling we all got from the HL expansion packs that put us back in Black Mesa over and over again.  The graphics are amazing.  Drawbacks?  Having to go through the Steam process to start your game.  Unanswered questions that left me wondering, such as (without giving too much away) what were the Combine doing with the humans?  What was under the Combine masks? But I suppose we will all find out because there is a HUGE suggestion at the end of the game that poor, tortured Gordon Freeman's adventures are not over.	1
Having played and finished all three of the most system demanding FPSs of this year, that being Doom 3, Half Life 2 and Far Cry, I have to give FAR CRY my unequivocal vote for the best of the best award.  Why this game over the rest you ask? Fair question, let me explain...  There is one thing they all have in common and that's outstanding graphics: on that point there is no question. Where Far Cry has a slight advantage is in its enemy AI that makes it a challenge to play against and to defeat (maybe a little too hard towards the end, even on easy). However the one thing Far Cry has over the other two notable candidates is its nonlinear game play. You can, in this game get directly from point "A" to point "B" if you want to, but you may be able to accomplish the same task easier and at less risk by getting to point "B" by going to point "C" or point "D" first. There is just so much more choice and in turn just so much more fun. It simply has a replay value that the other don't have.  That is not to say that Doom 3 and Half Life 2 aren't great games; they are and then some.  The other thing besides the linear game play that took some of the edge off Doom 3 for me, was the relentless darkness and gloom. True, this initially added to the super scary atmosphere, but I found that this effect started to wear off about 1/3 of the way through.  To some extent the same held true with Half Life 2. The facial features and lip sync were fabulously done. The air-propeller driven water buggy and the dune buggy episodes were really fun, but I found the long segments through bombed out apartment buildings and parking garages somewhat repetitive and tedious after a while.  All in all a great year for the FPSs if you have the hardware and the system to play any of these three games as they should be seen. Far Cry just has that little bit extra that makes it my choice for game of the year..	1
ENVELOPING STORY LINE,SUPERB GRAPHICS,CERTAINLY WORTH THE WAIT  TWO WORDS ,"BUY IT"	1
If the first person shooter genre owes existence to id Software, it owes form to Valve.  Valve not only defined the modern FPS, but developed one of the biggest computer games in history. An entire lexicon of marketing arose around the phrase "Half-Life killer". Plenty of shooters since boast higher graphics or more realistic physics or crazier weapons. Yet none has mastered the overall excellence of *Half-Life*. Until now.  To be sure, *HL* remains powerful and unique. No sequel can live up to the first love of a first title. *Half-Life 2* lives all on its own. Since I recently beat both games, the virtues of this second volume become fully apparent in comparison to the first.  I had to install it first. Valve requires *HL2* players to join their online game service Steam.  Steam figures into *HL2's* copy protection. It allows web customers to download Valve games, and provides multiplayer service with anti-cheat protection. Steam now provides a free HL2 Deathmatch expansion for multiplayers. Once fully installed and unlocked, *HL2* does NOT need to be logged into the Internet for play or updates (unless the player chooses to disable offline mode). I didn't experience any game lag or interference while Steam was running in the background. My firewall does not seem to interfere with game updates or offline play.  Some offline players complain *Half-Life 2* lacks story. *HL2* is all about story.  *HL* was about escaping a shattered research facility alive, and then stopping an inter-dimensional invasion. However creative the execution, it still amounts to escaping a maze full of monsters, death traps, and locked doors. Non-player characters were just headcrab fodder; occasionally, somebody could be recruited for unlocking doors or shooting aliens.  *Half-Life 2* follows a cast of NPCs who take more involved roles in Gordon's missions and determine his course. And Gordon's course takes him into a wider variety of adventures, puzzles, and battles. There are more and deeper plot twists and far more emotional involvement. After all, Gordon is now a leader and top fighter of a rebellion against Earth's conquerors.  Since *HL* games are interactive cinema, they don't have stories so much as they ARE the stories. Immersion comes being shown, not told. *HL2* drops players straight in without even a manual backstory. Players experience unbroken first person perspective-no cutscenes, no pre-or post-game movies. Even level loads merely pause the game instead of cutting away from the action.  *HL2* action takes place in some of the most surreal, most inspiring level design I've ever seen. Particularly during the "Route Kanal" and "Water Hazard" chapters, the game adopts a sort of industrial-noir, like old episodes of *Doctor Who*. *HL2's* "Ravenholm" easily shames the entire *They Hunger* mod, while "Nova Prospekt" makes prison movies look comfy. The lighting, textures, and props not only look great, but boost an illusion of a real world depleted of its resources and ravaged by alien animals.  Animals look better than any game outside of *Doom 3*. Id's critters are a tough act to follow, but *HL2's* humans emote far more than those of any other FPS: aside from the terrific voice acting, shoulders hunch, eyes dart, and postures stiffen and relax. Fingers and thumbs not only articulate, but pick up objects and hold them like a person would. And unlike the first game, *NPCs* can pick up and use weapons found on the street.   That leads to AI. The enemy security forces, who resemble the counter-terrorist ops from Terry Gilliam's *Brazil*, tend to team up somewhat better than the original Marines. Otherwise they take cover, hurl grenades, and charge like *HL* foes. Friends now jump and climb, but tend to bunch up around Gordon. They stumble into grenades and mines, but helpfully remind Gordon to avoid the same fate.   Mines can be handled with the gravity gun-a big star thanks to *HL2's* physics. Unlike *Far Cry*, objects don't slide down frictionless slopes. And unlike *Doom 3*, bodies don't spin like tops or disintegrate. Objects tumble as they fall from heights, while corpses dangle over ledges. Plastic and wooden objects float in water and will tip and sink under the player' weight. Gordon can also pick up stuff a person could pick up, like shoes and pop cans and paint canisters.   This is all vital to the revised puzzle system. Players no longer backtrack around a map activating generators and pumps. Nor do they navigate immense mazes of conveyor belts and airducts. Instead, physics puzzles requiring players to knock over bridges, find batteries hidden beneath containers, and pull plugs out of wall sockets. The sequel retains jumping and grate smashing navigation puzzles. *HL2* puzzles in general consume less time but are no less devious--though I never needed cheats or strategy guides to get somewhere.   Getting somewhere could be subject to stability. But the game never crashed on me. Save game and level load times never took longer than one minute and were usually shorter than most FPS titles. Audio stuttering was the worst problem, and it only happened to me in certain levels or with the AA cranked up.  Nothing's perfect but Valve let me down by cutting some corners. Players can no longer hurt allies and suffer the consequences-a realistic free will aspect of prior *HL* titles. The lack of multiple paths even in outdoor levels annoyed me, and many game boundaries seemed contrived. Valve also should have made the extra effort to introduce readable text to *HL2's* computer monitors. Having a destructible environment engine seems mandatory. I also feel modern shooters should have lean and prone functions, pistol whipping, and separate grenade selection and throwing keys: I knocked *D3* for not having them and so I knock *HL2*.  That knocks *HL2* down to four stars. The original was innovative and complete for it's day, while this sequel, like *D3*, feels somewhat dated and cut down. Otherwise I think a lot of the criticism levied at this game is unfair--even nonsense.  After years of nonsense about *Half-Life* killers, a title arrives not to slay but to partner up. *Half-Life 2* stands elbow to elbow with its older brother: being no revolution in gaming, nor a dumbed-down dirivitive. By introducing the most extensive physics, scripts, and character modeling in any game I've played, combined with a competitive graphics engine, thicker plot, and carefully sculpted levels, *Half-Life 2* achieves visual masterpiece. The crowbar has been raised.	1
I'm so frustrated I don't know where to begin. I bought Half Life 2 expecting an outstanding gaming experience. What I got was hours of frustration trying to figure out how to make it boot up. In all my years of gaming, I simply needed to double-click the desktop icon and away I went. But some genius there at Valve decided to make the most convoluted, invasive and frustrating interface ever conceived in the world of gaming!!! Can I simply click the Half Life 2 icon for the GAME I PAID FOR and play? NOOOOOOO! I have to go through some online nonsense called Steam. One day I click the icon and I have the option to play in "offline mode"; the next day I can't play because Steam won't let me. What were these people thinking!? I have uninstalled the game and have loaded up an old copy of GTA Vice City...now there's a game!  Sincerely frustrated,  KA Stone  Kernville, CA	-1
This game has a serious stuttering issue and Valve has still not resolved it. You can read all about the bug. There is also an ungodly long thread on Valve's website called Audio Stuttering  You can read all about the problem. It plagues machines that are fast and slow. There is no ryhme or reason that it happens. It happens to me and makes the game completely unplayable.  The game would be near perfect if it was not for this huge technical glitch. It also appears that Valve knew about this problem.  I think this is a travesty. I have spent 50 bucks only to not be able to play the game in a satisfactory manner.	-1
Another bar raising by valve.  The AI, the vehicles, the environments and especially the directional sound and graphics  are so much better than anything out there and the control is really great too.  I was playing with my bose noise cancelling headphones and those skeleton things would sneak up on me and then howl and I got so creeped out I had to go back to the speakers.  UNBELIEVABLE!  A great thing about the game is it runs on my Intel 845 onboard graphic chip on my work PC so I don't have to pull out my ancient windows 98 system with my fancy graphics card unlike so many games out there (electronic arts) that require hardware T&L.  Ok this steam thing is obnoxious, and it hangs sometimes so the game won't load period, other times it is downloading crap without asking me, but even the puzzles in this game raise the bar using gravity and bouyancy and impact.  FUN FUN FUN!	1
My first time playing any of the Half-Life games. Were the others as frustratingly difficult to setup/register ? Also, this game brought my computer(Chip-P4 HT@3.0/800fsb ...RAM-1gb DDR2 ...CARD-Radeon X800SE PCI Express 128mb) to it's knees.  I have virtually nothing running in the background + turned down my desktop resoution to 800x600. Which detracted from the anticipated graphic experience. I know it's not top-o-line, but I thought the gameplay on lower setting wouldn't as bad(Slow/Choppy/Jerky and sound problems) and the graphics were comparable to games costing half the price. The game itself seemed enjoyable, but I guess you really need patience in registering and a $3,000+ computer system to "focus" on the experience of Half-Life 2 :-) Maybe I expected too/so much, considering all the hoopla over the predecessors and the buzz about this release ? And at $50, well, I bought some older games to tide me over(...new to gaming)until these new releases that just came out, and the 4 games in total cost less than Half-Life 2. Each of the 4(Thief 1,2,3 and Deus Ex) were more enjoyable(gameplay) while the graphics were just fine with me.  I'm more concerned with gameplay than graphics. With me, gaming isn't a cinematic event.	-1
I don't know about other gamers, but I've been getting frustrated with games recently.  They look better than ever, but there's still a lot of room for improvement.  Game play, also, is in desperate need of betterment.  So without further ado, allow me to make Half-Life 2 the "poster boy" of recent PC games.  I like this game a lot, but I just feel that it reflects some of the contempt that the gaming industry is showing toward its customers.  I won't say too much about Steam because other people have been very vocal about the troubles it's causing.  I needed to wait about an hour to install the five CDs and then sign up with Steam.  It was an unpleasant experience, but not that bad.  As for the graphics, they're better than anything else I've seen including Doom 3, but they're not perfect either.  Outdoor levels have low resolution, and as a result the trees often look fuzzy.  Nevertheless, buildings look good with vivid colors and lots of detail.  This graphical sophistication comes at a price, and my system really strained under the weight.  I'd recommend a 3 Ghz CPU, 1 GB RAM, and a 256 MB graphics card if you want to run the game smoothly.  Sound is very good although it often stuttered.  Evidently my hardware is a little slow for this game, and I believe the demanding graphics slows your system which can adversely affect the sound.  Considering the game play, it's very similar to the first game.  The crowbar is back along with the head crabs.  You can really get engaged in the game play, but in some parts of the game it fell flat.  I found myself fending off tough enemies while having little idea of how to either escape or destroy them.  It could be as much fun as swatting at a cloud of pesky gnats!  Finally, after several tries, I would find the place to get away or the weapon to kill the thing attacking me.  Do yourself a favor and get a good strategy guide for this game.  It will save you a lot of frustration.  In closing, I find myself wishing that game developers and publishers would take better care to see that the customer is getting a good product.  Half-Life 2 delivers some fantastic experiences, but these achievements are marred by frustrating and annoying game play on some of the levels, the demanding system requirements, and a bug or two that disallows continuation of the game.  And I must really protest the requirement to set up that annoying account with Steam.  Personally, I'm fed up with all this, and as a result, I have no plans to buy anymore computer games for the foreseeable future.  So developers and publishers, you just lost a customer.	1
I hate to say it, but after playing Halo2 and about a third into HL2. I have to say HL2 is the better game in terms of storyline, technology and fun factor.  In my opinion, Halo2 was not as well executed as the original and there are areas in the game you noticed that they most likely rushed to get the game out. The original Halo had a 'epic' feel to the storyline. The voice over was clear and the variety of settings keep you engaged throughout. In Halo2, a lot of the magic was simply not there. It feels more like a narrowly focused storyline, and most of the time I could even understand what the characters were saying.  Not true so far with HL2. HL2 is as strong (if not stronger) than the original HL. The character model and animation is the best I've seen so far. They look so real it's frightening. The story from chapter to chapter makes sense and has a organic continuation throughout. It draws me in as I play more and more.  The biggest negative feedback I have is the load time between chapters. On a slower machine, it is rather tedious and especially if you sometimes want to revisit previous chapter to get ammo or stuck. What happen to the original HL quick load feature?  A multi-player version of HL2 will also have helped much. This is where Halo2 will win for sure as it will win more mind share among gamers after they finished the single player mode.  Overall, I can't give HL2 less than a 5 star. It's the best shooter I've played so far.	1
First, I agree the install is a pain.  But once you get past this HL2 is a fantaorgasmic treat for the senses. There are a lot of place you have to plan your strategery to get through.  If you like FPS, this is the game for you.	1
How Much Fun Is This Game? 12 Stars At Least  How Do I Rate This Game? One of the Greatest Games Of All-time, and easily The Best First Person Shooter ever created.  Chances are, you've played the first game - and you know it's unbelievable. It got game of the year for a reason.  Now, disregarding any issues you probably won't even have installing the game (I downloaded through Steam 20 minutes after it was released) - the game itself is perfect in pretty much ever single way.  Just make sure you have a pretty decent system to run this mamoth beast. But, if you meet the reccomended settings - then you're going to be in for a treat.  I've been playing literally every major video game release since I was born (1986). And I can honestly say, without a doubt, out of all of the hundreds (possibly thousands) of games I've played - <font size="+2">Half Life 2 is going to be the most fun you've ever had doing anything with a video game - ever.</font>  The graphics, the phyiscs, and sound in this game are absolutely to die for. Quite possibily the nicest, most realistic thing I have ever seen. You shoot a tin can, it'll bounce and make noise exactly like a tin can. You pick up a matress with your gravity-gun, and you throw it a zombie, and it will fold around him, and flop to the floor - and then he'll walk over it, as it slowly gives way under his weight. Amazing. You will have a geek-asm the minute you start this thing up, its amazing.  The graphics, superior 5.1 sound, and physics aside - the gameplay is non-stop incredible fun, with lots of cool puzzle-solving areas (but never too many), lots of cool vehicles and awesome weapons - plus, the Story of the game is just as good - if not better - than Half Life 1 (which Steam has awesomely redone with the HL2 graphics engine). Now, that's not to say the story is the greatest thing ever... but it still pretty good, and the characters are definitely rememberable in this one. But if you're looking for some unbelievable lets-all-get-a-bowl-of-popcorn storyline, then go get a Final Fantasy title or something, otherwise, this above-par storyline will do just nicely, as it in now way is bad (its ju	1
The game is excellent in its gameplay, graphics, and overall mood/theme (although this was simply taken from George Orwell's novel "1984".) Annoyances: have to register with "steam" in order to play (this is the equivalent of "Pepsi" being shoved into multiple scenes of a movie because of a corporate partnership/agreement, and at $49.99, it apparently made money for Sierra but didn't go towards defraying the cost of the game. Additionally, I spent 50 bucks to install and play HL2, but now I have to surrender extra disk space to have "steam" installed on my hard drive. Want to play the game but not bother with "steam"? Well, you can't. Both or neither are the options.). After you install, you have to wait a ridiculous amount of time to "unlock" the game (supposedly to prevent piracy, but it took my computer no less than 30 minutes. Another reviewer said it took them hours. I did wait over 20 minutes on the first attempt only to cancel the installation, assuming something must be wrong--no game has EVER taken nearly so long to install--and found that the next attempt at installation to 30 minutes, at least on my system); and HL2 continues if not progresses the inexplicable trend towards longer and longer "security codes" that have to be entered: mine was TWENTY-FIVE letters/numbers long! I realize they expect to sell alot of units, but that allows for about 2 to the 36th power combinations. TEN digits are enough to cover every phone number in the country...do we need to make registering a game this impossible? Also, my first copy of HL2 didn't work: it wouldn't install. I exchanged it at EB games. In short, excellent game, possibly qualifies as ground-breaking in the graphics department, less so in the plot/game play, and is a disaster in regards to the amount of patience required to install.	1
Okay, I've had my copy of HL2 for about week and was too busy to install it.  After reading all the complaining, whining and moaning on Amazon.com, I decided to give it a try.  It couldn't have been easier.  The program walked me completely through the process, step-by-step. All that was requested was a User Name, Password and my Disk Key Number. Then some files on my HD were decrypted. And that was it. It took me all of 10 minutes to create my Steam Account (whatever it is).  And you don't need to log on to the Internet to play the game -- repeat, you don't need to be on the Internet to play Half Life 2.  The "offline mode" works just fine.  A connection is only required for the initial process which is like a registration (the Internet requirement is mentioned right on the box -- it's not like they tried to hide anything).  My copy installed so easily and has run so flawlessly, I'm led to believe that most of the problems others are having are originating between the keyboard and the chair -- not in the computer or software.  Steam is definitely a bummer but that's the price we're paying for piracy.  I can't totally blame Valve for this.  The game itself is absolutely incredible. I've been playing computer games for about 10 years (mostly FPS), and this is right near or at the top of my list.  To the people who are "unsatisfied" with the gameplay, I don't know what the hell they were expecting.  To me, this is as good as it gets: total immersion in a game world for 15-16 hours.  My system is strong, but it's about a year old and nothing particularly special.  It plays HL2 totally glitch-free and smoothly at "high" settings in 1024 x 768 resolution (the game determined the settings), and I haven't had a single crash or problem.  The graphics are literally photographic quality.  HL2 sets an entirely new standard for games.  Everything can be used and/or interacted with, the physics are incredible (break a crate and then use the pieces, etc.), the people look totally individual and are detailed like photographs (the first time I've ever seen people done this well in a game) -- it's truly amazing.  In some places I was  hoping the game could have had some sort of conversation routine.  Especially with Dr. Vance's fine daughter Alex (she even says "You're a man of few words."  Sorry Alex, no choice, I'm afraid.).  This is the clumsiest part of the game to me. You become a "hero" to the NPC's in the game, they talk to you, and you can even lead groups of them during certain fights, but you can't answer back when they say something.  Anybody having trouble with the overall story must not have played the original HL.  The attention to detail is incredible (right down to photographs on desks, newspaper clippings, books, etc.). And yes, the game loads like the first HL when you reach a new level, and the load times can take 15 seconds or so. This probably depends on the amount of RAM in your system and the general quality of your HD and CPU.  It's no big deal unless you're actually looking for something to bum you out. Generally, HL2 is a perfect extension of how the original could have ended. The original was the "invasion", and this is the "outcome" -- and how many of the original characters reacted or ended up.  Many of the main characters are the same, many of the weapons are the same, the new vehicles are great, the enemy is the same, the overall atmosphere is the same but expanded, etc.  As for as gameplay, I can say that I've already had some of the most exciting moments of any computer game (like a trip down the canal in an unarmed airboat while being chased by a helicopter gunship armed with cannon and mines and a final duel with the chopper (after you get a decent weapon)-- just incredible.  And I'm only about 2/3 through.  The main difference in HL2 is that the action takes place mostly outdoors in a nameless Eastern European country as opposed to Black Mesa - a much larger environment to operate in. You're still Gordon Freeman, you still wear an HEV suit, and even your old drinking buddy Barney  from HL (security guard at Black Mesa) is still around (he saves your ass right off). You've still got to deal with the zombies (a whole town full of them), several varieties of those damn headcrabs and many, many new enemies -- both extra-dimensional and homegrown -- including particularly evil types of cops and "Combine" soldiers. I could go on and on about this game, but what's the point?  All I can say is that if you're a Half Life fan, this was well worth the wait.  If you're not, that's cool too.  I've played games like Far Cry (great game), but this is simply better to me.  I would recommend this game to any FPS fan -- or even a fan of cutting edge computer graphics or programming.  Valve has managed to totally blow my mind.  And for people who complain there's not enough "substance" in HL2, it's only an FPS game after all.  How "deep" is it supposed to be?  As I said before, of all the FPS games I have ever played, this is right at the top of the list.  Finally, as for Steam, it does have a use.  I just logged on and downloaded a new (and free) multiplayer "deathmatch" version last night.  It took about 15 minutes and it's great.  And yes, you need the Internet for this one.  EDIT:  As for the game being "buggy", I don't know what to say.  It runs perfectly on my machine (and thousands of others).  Perhaps the problems some people are having relate to "operator error" or computer problems (out-of-date motherboard drivers, video drivers, etc.). There's no patch that will fix this sort of thing.  This may be why many  developers are moving to consoles (Xbox, PS2) -- consoles don't require much maintenance from the user.  One's pretty much the same as another.  If this is true, it's really sad.	1
Half-Life, the original version was more than the game Half-Life.  It was the best engine to be released at that time.  For those that aren't game junkies, the Engine is the nuts and bolts of the game that control the scenery, character appearance, movement and interaction of all objects.  The original Half-Life engine was later used in countless other game titles. So a Half-Life 2 release is more significant than the actual Half-Life 2 game itself.  They've brought out an outstanding new engine that improves graphics from the status quo as well as adding many new things that other game publishers tend to ignore.  In HL2 you can interact with almost every object in the game and they move incredibly like that same object would in real life.  I found myself sidetracked from the storyline for hours on end messing around.  I ran in to someones apartment, pulled the TV (that was on) out of the wall (it turned off and sparked as the cord yanked out of the wall) and threw it out the window.  Take note that the bad reviews on this game are for the most part issues with install and copy protection.  I chose the default settings and my install went through fine.  I signed up for Steam and typed in my info, that went through without a hitch.  I underscore this: You must have internet connected at install!  I have to disagree with all the people bashing this game soley based on their own problems installing it.  I read a couple negative reviews where it doest appear they even played the game yet claim that its horrible.  What many people don't know, is PC Games are pirated more than movies and music.  Half Life 2 cost over $40 million to make, they have to try and protect their investment.  How can anyone own a PC and expect it to work like an xbox or PS2?  Its a variable platform with unlimited hardware variances from one box to the next.  It is very difficult to make one piece of software be perfect on 100% of machines.  That said, i've heard they (haxors) already defeated the protection, so now steam is just a pain in the arse of legit people that have bought the game.  In any case, I enjoyed playing Half-Life 2 the single player game all the way through to the end.  There are parts of it that are actually kind of scary, like this zombie town you have to go though.  One tip though, think gravity gun and saw blades! Notice how when an NPC talks to you, they actually will turn their head and look at you, if you move their eyes will follow you.  These subtle differences make this a big step for gaming.  HL2 is more than just a game, its a relase of an entire genre of new games that will follow, a catalyst for many good things to come.	1
I waited and waited and waited and waited for the game to be on the store shelves. Finally no more delays and I got my over fifty dollar version. Okay. It's gonna be a great game . That's what I have read  it was and after so many delays it had to be considering its predecessors. Five disks to install. kind of like shades of XIII.Don't get a nice thick jewel case however. Got it all installed and then I had to activate it. I can see  their reason why. No problem I thought to myself. I said that  and after an hour activating and decrypting files I'm still not ready to play the game. Think I'll just take it out and put a nice easy to install  ,no fuss,no mess game in and put my long waited for and beautiful copy of HL2 in a closet where I can't see how much money I wasted.	-1
I had to add my rating after I saw this game was getting something less than five stars (at this time).  Ignore the idiots who reviewed the game before they played it, or rated it based on their opinions of VALVe. I just finished this game, and it's the best FPS I've ever played, period.  Doom 3 doesn't even come close.  The physics engine alone is worth the money, not to mention the Level design.  Nothing else feels like this game.  You don't just play H-L 2 as live in it for 16 hours.  There are titanic battles that felt so real I had to take a break and get un-shellshocked. VALVe deserves to have this game judged on it's own merrits, not the BS drama surrounding it's release. If this isn't a five-star game--you might as well just scrap the whole rating system.	1
This is a wondrous, ground-breaking game with far more positives than negatives. Would I buy it again? Yes.  The positives are many and superlative:  I would give each of these elements an A+ score: Acting and voice-overs for the NPC, graphics that depict the gritty realism of City 17 at a level approaching reality, the ability to create a sense of place and mood every bit as good as the best cinema, delightful, human, light moments to off-set the depressing mood of City 17, physics, masterful digital artwork, engaging original storyline, expressive facial expressions for NPCs, intense action.  The downside.  Requires fast broadband to reduce the hassle of installation. Requires a high-end PC. No CD case and CDs poorly packaged (several of mine were scratched.) No game manual. Game play does seem overly linear at times.  Several steps in the installation were far from intuitive. An invasive, Orwellian copyright protection scheme that seems to have been designed by the same fascists that designed City 17.  Think of it this way, it's like going to a really good movie but the ticket taker is a jack boot thug who insults and frisks you on the way in.	1
For level setting purposes, I have provided my computer's basic specs so that you can assess whether your experience will be better or worse than mine... 1) HP 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 Processor with 384 MB of RAM 2) ATI Video Card: 128M dedicated video RAM 3) XP Home Edition, Service Pack 2 4) Comcast High Speed Internet Connection (3 meg down, 256k up) 5) 16X Pioneer CD/DVD Drive 6) DirectX 9.0  With the above specs, I'd expect that my machine is basically middle of the road, but that my data connection is faster than most.  Given the above, the following are the Pro's and Con's...  Pro's... 1) Best graphics ever 2) Similar to Halo, character has access to extremely cool machines (dune buggies, airboats, etc.) -- these add a tremendous amount to the game 3) At times, more twisted and dark and chilling than Doom 3 4) The .357 magnum rocks! 5) Easy to learn 6) Pretty darned stable for a high end game -- after more than 10 hours of play, my machine hasn't crashed once (please check other reviews as this may not be a common experience)  Con's... 1) It's been said a hundred times below, so I won't belabor it: it took me almost four hours to install the game (loading 5 discs plus going thru the anti-piracy Steam process) -- this is three and a half hours too long, and is reason enough to return the game for a full refund (those with little patience shouldn't even think about buying this title) 2) The Steam process doesn't end at install -- about every 15 minutes of gameplay, the game needs to synch with an on-line site, this can take anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes 3) Takes several hours of gamelplay to get to cool weapons 4) The back-story is extremely thin and unimaginative -- even for an FPS.  About halfway thru the game, the developers try to introduce a more robust story line, but it is too little, too late, very uninteresting and ultimately more of an annoying distraction than anything else.  Net/net: the game and the company could not possibley have hoped to live up to all the hype they were generating, but it's a decent FPS once you get it installed.  I'd wait a month or two for the price to drop and for the patches to start rolling out before I'd recommend anyone buying it.	-1
First off the install is horribly botched. If you choose to not install Counter-Strike (the ONLY install option besides the location) the install fails. Luckily for me it was a known issue and the fix was on the Web (you HAVE to install it). After that you get to the online registration for Vue. This turns out to be bogus, marketing fluff NOT the game registration but you don't learn that until later. Then you finally get to the game registration that requires an Internet connection and then ERROR. Well it turns out my firewall was blocking the sign-up but the game interface does not say 'can't connect' or anything remotely helpful I just got some bogus error. I thought it was the timeout error everyone was talking about with the Steam service. It wasn't until a lot of hassle later I learned otherwise. All of this is insanely annoying for a game everyone knew would be a hot seller.  Anyway, once installed, registered, and running the game is simply gorgeous and the sound and music awesome. Best of any game to date, period. Blows away Doom 3 and runs in full glory at high res with no problem on good hardware (again better than Doom 3). It also does the best job of creating an 'atmosphere' than any game to date.  The gameplay is what you would expect but with an excellent physics engine. The in-game character interactions are the best ever done. The characters can actually EMOTE to a small degree and do simple things like look at you as you move and follow you with their eyes. You really have to see it.  Now having said all that the story is very disappointing and quickly predictable. The initial mystery wears off real fast. Worse, the first few levels of the game are rather boring (although nicely creepy at first) as are some later ones. Things that are novel at first are way over done and you just feel "ok, let's move on" but then you get more levels of the same. The game does a great job of guiding you through each level without being obvious but I did need to use a cheat guide for a few tricky spots. It took me around 40 hours to finish and I have no desire to play the whole thing again because of some of the tedium but will re-visit some particular levels. The save system allows you to save at any time and also auto-saves for you so you can easily go back.  Overall it is a gorgeous looking/sounding game with an OK story and average gameplay. It blows Doom 3 away but I think Far Cry still had more interesting story/levels.	1
Half-life 2 is the only game you need if you're a shooter fan. It is state of the art in every conceivable way. The talented developers at Valve software have created a product that ushers us into the next plateau of gaming. You won't find a more engrossing gaming experience if you tried. Valves creativity and attention to detail is unbelievable. Textures are photo-realistic. The Character models are far beyond anything ever seen in a game. Even more impressive is the object physics. Every object has mass and weight. Materials that are flammable will burn. The modified Havoc engine makes bodies flop around and float in the water. Bodies do not disappear when they die. When you hit the dead head crabs with your crowbar they flop around like freshly plucked chickens. The story is secondary to the engine and gameplay but anything would look bad when you compare it to those aspects of the game. The game runs great on any DX9 card. That means more people can enjoy half-life 2 than any 1st person shooter produced this year. The only downside to Half-life 2 is that eventually it ends.	1
Well, if you read the reviews you will see it all spelled out for you.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  You can't even play it.  You need a high-speed, always on connection in order to play this title (unless you want to wait for 4 hours on dial-up).  The heck with that trash, I spent $55 on this title - and I need Steam's permission each time I want to play it? Where was that on the box? Also not on the box is the fact that you have to wait in line for your turn to get permission - yes, this from the same company that had its source code hacked, so you can just imagine how reliable their servers are.  Apparently there is a way to play the game offline, but it doesn't work for everyone, and some people are being told by Steam/Valve that they have to disable their LAN's - no way!  Note to anyone that hasn't opened the box - DON'T.  Unopened you can return it easily.  You open it and returning it is an entirely different ball game.  So tell everyone that you can to stay away from this game, maybe when the dust settles they will release a patch that revokes the necessary Steam membership.  If not, well, the only thing I can suggest to people who want to "play" the game they paid for, look for someone who is sharing a hack online.  For once I think the pirates are justified - and that sickens me.	-1
By now you don't need much in the way of basics, story, graphics, etc.  Like some others, I had some initial issues with Steam.  Steam is the software system that Valve uses to authenticate the game and prevent piracy.  Once that minor snafu was resolved, I started playing.  The plot, graphics and voice acting meld together to create an immersive, compelling story worthy of any Hollywood movie I have seen all year.  If you love Sci-Fi, this game is for you.  I have played every major shooter in the last 5 years and this game is on level of its own.  The graphics, physics and gameplay are simply stunning.  It took 6 years and it was well worth it. I wrote off the early reviews as hype when they consistently called this the greatest game ever written for the PC.  Now that I have played, I know what they meant.  I think it's unfair to rate a game that you have never played.  Steam may have it's issues, but it's immaterial once when the game is running. I highly, highly recommend this game.	1
I agree with some of the other reviewers. there are too many security hoops to jump through to play this game as well as a long installation process.  However once you clear those hurdles  you are in for a great ride.  The level design is top notch as well as the sound effects and the graphics.  I was disappointed with the long load times and there are some minor glitches during the game that can take you out of the moment.  It is however very realistic.  there is a part at the beginning were a security guard takes you into a room for an interrogation  and I've got to tell you my heart was pounding.  I'm thinking how am I going to get out of this with no weapon.  Later on there is a great level where you are on a watercraft and are trying to out run a helocopter and it gets very intense.  I also love how some of the aliens from the first game are now your allies.  I can remember looking at one thinking if he even blinks at me wrong I am going to unload on him.  Great stuff.  Like I said some problems with installation but it is worth it once you start playing.  Pros: Level design, sound effects, graphics, story, pace  Cons:  Forces you to have an account with steam(no cost ), long load times, some of the puzzles get a little tiresome and repetitive.	1
Unfortunately I've spent more time waiting for Steam to authorize my CD for an off-line, single-player game than actually playing the game itself.  While HL2 does deliver on the hype with a truly immersive experience (I haven't even gotten to the monsters yet, and even City 17 itself is downright creepy), the hair-pulling content protection mechanism that is Steam makes the whole affair frustrating to the point of giving up.  Which is a pity, as HL2 is a fantastic follow up to its predecessor.  I suspect Steam will either work out its kinks or go the way of DivX, but in the meantime, welcome back, Dr. Freeman!	-1
This is by far the best FSP I have played, ever, on console or PC. Better than Doom 3 which I thought was very good (but the use flashlight but not weapons at same time theory crushed the mood at some point, as well as having to do the same basic things in each level as we all know by now (kill enemies, find key, unlock door, kill more enemies, find next key, etc.). But HL2's puzzles toss things up quite a bit. There have been numerous times where I have been stuck for over 5 minutes looking around the area and trying to figure out what to do next. While this is at first very frustrating, the feeling of accomplishment afterwards is kind of rewarding and fresh.  The gravity gun is sweet, what more can I say about whipping saw-blades at zombies' heads?  The graphics are amazing, the sounds are sweet, and even the music goes nicely with the gameplay and comes in at the right moments it seems. I wasn't expecting it to have as many moments that make you "jump"  as Doom 3 had, but I am still pretty satisfied in that category. You'll know what i mean as early as " We Dont Go to Ruoughville" or whatever it's called. to be honest I cant remember clearly, i Have been playing the game for too long on end. I tell myself at times that I will only play 5 more minutes, but you get so engulfed in the game and seeing what is going to happen next, that 5 minutes quickly turns into an hour and so on.  When bullets are whizzing by and striking water or dirt, the splashes and such are extremely life-like. I was in a state of awe when  I first saw this (even though I was getting lit up like a Christmas tree by the Chopper).  I could ramble on for a while on this, but I'll cut down to the chase right now.  I say its the best FSP, but obviously not perfect. Maybe i just don't have the top of the line system, but I have a pretty solid machine (Vaio 3.2 ghz with ATI radeon 9800 pro)... but it still at times slows up right when saving or after loading a level... but after that it is solid as gold. Also, yes- the loading times do get kind of annoying but it is do-able because the wait is well worth it. And when you save it the sound seems to lock up for a few seconds, making it sound like a CD skipping. But all in all, those are very minor and the actual gameplay is amazing and I am probably not even 1/4 of the way through the game yet.  Setting it up/installing it did take a little while, maybe close to an hour in total, but that is tolerable, and I can see how people are pissed about the Steam thing, and I don't like it either, I'm glad i have DSL though, but if u don't have that or Cable, then I can really see how u would be annoyed.  But like others have stated on here before, it is a shame that some people couldn't even get it to work, and therefore rated it 1 star. Because it shoudldnt be a rating based on a bad installation process, but about how the actual game is.  And the game is one of the best.	1
This game is incredible.  The graphics, water effects, AI, and feel are spot-on.  It's incredible all the stuff they managed to put into this.  The only downside, is their damn excessive copy protection.  OK, fine - use a protected CD that's deeded during the game, OR a CD Key you have to type in, OR activation at installation, OR online components that need to be available to run the game.  ONE, people!  NOT ALL FOUR!  But, to be fair, I have to give it a 5 out of 5.	1
I'll go from good to bad.  The Good:  The look of the game is unbelievable.  The attention to detail is just amazing: trash everywhere, pealing paint on the walls, the clouds in the sky.  The physics are the best of any game I've played (Far Cry, Call of Duty, Soldier of Fortune 2).  When you shoot someone they fall realistically, ragdoll that really works.  Barrels and crates wobble realistically when you bump into them, and when a helicopter flies past power lines and they bounce up and down and the trash flies around from the prop blast.  It's fabulous.  The sound is good as well, when a body falls from an elevation, you hear the thud of the body hitting the ground.  You don't need a high end machine to get great looking graphics. With a P4 2.4 g Hz, 1 Gig Ram, and a GeForce FX 5700 U video card, I get FPS of up to 50 - 70.  The Fair: The game is fairly linear.  You go from the beginning to the end of the map without much deviation. You interact with lots of things on the way, but you have to stay with the script.  In other words, it's a decent first person shooter, but it's not really ground breaking.  The Bad: The activation is literally a royal pain. First: TURN OFF YOUR FIREWALL. I sat there for hours with the error message: "Can not connect to Steam, there may be a problem with your internet connection or with the Steam Network. " I couldn't get connected until I turned the Firewall off, and I only use the Microsoft XP firewall from the latest service pack. Next it took hours to decrypt the game, it stalled at 50%, then stalled again at 83% because the Steam server  logged off saying the server was too busy..."try again later. "  This was over the weekend 4 days after the release.  Then it took until the next day to get through to the Steam server to finally activate the game and start to play.  A good thing is you don't have to connect to the Steam server to play after you've finished with the activation. You have the option to play offline when Steam first starts up when you boot your machine.  I understand their motivation to try to limit piracy, but it's we legal full price paying customers that have to deal with this garbage. There has to be a better way.  Bottom line: this is the best looking FPS out there and well worth the game play, but I hate encouraging Vivendi and Steam to make this the standard way of doing business.  It would be a dark day if gamers had to install every game this way.	1
After Doom 3 I was very nervous about the amount of hype surrounding Half-life 2. After a bit of debate, I went ahead and bought the game the day it released at a nearby Wal-mart.  It took a bit to unlock, no big surprise there especially on opening day. The couple people who had problems need to take a chill pill and just be patient... Valve is doing what they can to prevent massive losses to piracy which is understandable.  Soooooo, I then started the game. Right off the bat I was amazed at the graphics. Screenshots and rave reviews should have prepared me, but there is nothing like experiencing it for yourself. However, graphics are not the only thing that matters in a game.  Its the other factors that really moved this from "wow" up to the scale of "one of the best PC games I've ever played."  Voice acting - superb. lips move with the voice overs perfectly. They also do a good job of making it feel immersive.  Plotline - Awesome (so far). Haven't beat it yet.  Playability - this game was a lot nicer to my machine than Doom 3, and still looks a LOT better. Its nice to see some actual coding efficiency rather than whatever Doom 3 did.  Multiplayer - The thing that will keep it #1 for a while. They already have CS Source out (which is a blast) with more on the way. HL 1 dominated the market for popular FPS mods (CS, team fortress, DoD, etc) and HL 2 is already setting up to continue that trend.  Overall, I am very glad I bought HL 2. Is it hyped?  Yes. But this time there is a very good reason for it.	1
I bought this game 4 days after it's release, and it seems I avoided the frustration of Valve's clogged authentification server.  I installed the game from 5 CDs, then it sent me online, and registered/unlocked fine within 20 min or so.  I think the reviews with complaints about the online registration not working are no longer applicable now that the mad rush from the people who wanted to get their hands on the game at 12 midnight the day it was released is over.  The game has been a blast to play.  It kept everything good from the original title and has made many improvements as well.  The main additions to the game I've really enjoyed include some very fun vehicles and a couple of very enjoyable weapons.  The graphics are great along with the sound and sutle background music.  The physics engine in this game really is amazing.  There is so much you can interact with in the game enviornment... it's the best physics interaction I've seen in any game up to this point.  If you enjoyed playing the original Half Life, you WILL really enjoy playing this sequal.  The only downside to this game is you HAVE to have an internet connection available to activate it after you install it.  That seems a little invasive and annoying to me.  After you get it authenticated you can play it offline as much as you want.  Just remember, every time you ever have to re-install this game in the future, you will have to connect to the internet to activate it again before you can play it offline.	1
Yes, this is the best FPS ever (where 'ever' really means 'for now anyway'). Yes, the collector's edition is a total con, so just buy the standard version. No, the packaging doesn't even come with a manual. Yes, the game is short, and you can complete it in a couple of days. And yes, you are likely to have one or two niggling problems getting it working as of the initial, unpatched version (Steam related security and game stuttering being the most prevalent).  Now the really cool thing about this game... It's actually fun to play.  Here's the three reasons why  One: Unlike many other fps games, where all you do is run around shooting things and the only thing that really changes is the scenery around you (well... apart from Doom 3, where they seem to have forgot about the `scenery should change every level' deal), Half life 2 adds whole sections of the game where you are in one of a couple of vehicles, and that totally changes the game dynamic. This adds real variety to the game. It also has a lot more puzzles in it than the average fps, so there are real breaks in the game when you have to think about the next step. So, number one - real variety throughout the game.  Another reason for HL2 being so much fun is the greater accuracy of the non-players (NPCs). A system of facial animation makes for much more immersive set-pieces, where the ai characters on your side are much more believable, and therefore make the gameworld itself more belivable. The only downside of the facial animation system is that it hasn't been used in your enemies (they all have helmets or have `headcrabs' covering their faces), which is perhaps either a bit of a bad design decision or a philosophical decision (ie don't make the people you have to kill so realistic). The game also contains a very good physics engine, and this is also used in many of the puzzles. So, for number 2, we're talking much greater immersion into the game world.  Finally, the single player game is story driven, just like the original HL, and that makes you really want to see what happens next. Not only that, but there are far fewer long pauses of boredom than many other games - the whole thing is well paced, and that shows that a long time was spent by the designers of the game in game design (something that is often rushed in many games, some of which seem to be just `something added to pay for the game engine development' for certain other games we could talk about! So, three is just simply 'good game design'... something that is so often forgotten in the rush for great graphics.  There are a number of reservations though, and they are more to do with the fps genre in total rather than this game in particular. The old `you cant go over this fence to get where you want to even though you have grenades to blow it up, and have to instead take a longer route around a monster ridden level, jumping across death defying chasms and all sorts of other stuff' is there.  Also the facial animation is only realistic in terms of other fps games of the moment - it's kinda up to bad low budget sitcom acting level because many of the expressions are exaggerated for effect. Finally, the game feels a bit rushed in some places (despite the overall good game design), particulary in the packaging. This shows through in the lack of any printed material in the case (not even a pdf on the disk). It also results in a slightly disapointing ending (obvously the design team were a little pushed for time here...).  This isn't the best video game ever, just the best amongst its FPS peers (and that may only be because it is the latest!). Still, it kept me up all night, and that's the major hallmark of a good game.  Hardware specs: Works very well on my system at 1280x1024 and x2 AA, Athalon XP2800+, Radeon 9800 pro, 1 gig. Most of the issues noted at the start of this review were solved by driver changes and tweaks to the HL2 configuration files, and it appears that the 1gig of RAM is the most important issue for smooth play (you also have to make HL2 use it all by a quick and easy change to the config)  S	1
I picked up HL2 yesterday and have put in around 6-7 hours so far. This game is absolutely amazing in every way except for the load times. The Graphics are STUNNING, Gameplay is EXCELLENT (for me at least) I only have a 1.5 P4 768RAM TI4600 graphics card and have not had even one lag in the entire game as of yet. I went with the recommended settings and even those are at the highest levels! Currently I am stuck in a hard situation however I refuse to cheat or use guides. I have waited for this game for so incredibly long, I want to savor everything, including getting stuck for a bit.  I personally can not say enough about this game, and definately feel that it will set a new standard for PC games to come.  I only rated the overall a 4 because of loading time, however my processor isn't exactly top notch anymore;)  P.S. The only time I have ever used the internet in this game was during installation, after varification of serial number and setup, I havn't had to use the internet at all to play.	1
I just got the game and to my surprise, even though it's a single player game, I HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE NET TO PLAY IT !!  Not only that, but the game converts all your old Valve games to the new technology, so you also can't play them anymore unless you're connected.  Now I don't know which website this is, but can you imagine the scene?  You and 50 million kids all wanna play this game on Saturday morning.  What do you think the chances are?  Particularly if you have a dial-up.  I'm returning the game unplayed.  No way am I paying $55 for a game and don't really own it.  Very stiff rental fee.  I'll buy no more Valve/Steam products.	-1
Half-Life 2 smacks the crap out of Far Cry and Doom 3. My computer I bought over the summer is paying off. P4 3.4 Ghz, ATI X800 XT 256MB, and 1 Gig of DDR2. This game does have high requirements. So if your computer is below a P4 1.8 Ghz, better think about upgrading. I don't mind the loading times between scenes in the gameplay. The AI is much smarter than Far Cry or Doom 3. Sounds really good on a 5.1 surround sound system. The graphics are top notch. I have played it for 4 hours and more stages keep coming. The steam verification is a pain though. They could of at least just sent the registration via internet without having to create a new account and install steam onto the computer. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY FPS FAN! Read the PC Gamer issue which gave a 98% Editor's Choice review and believe me they are right on target.	1
WOW. Half-Life 2 is perhaps the greatest game of the year thus far. It may even be considered among the ranks of the greatest ever. A lot of people claim that you shouldn't buy this game this early because it may have bugs and it has an expensive pricetag. Trust me, the price is well worth it. As for bugs, I haven't seen any and I've been playing for close to 2 days.  HL2 breaks down into four categories:  GAMEPLAY  Holy crap, this game if fun. I love it. Don't get me wrong, Doom 3 and Halo 2 are great as well (I own all 3), but HL2 is the clearcut winner in terms of outright experiance. The AI is incredible. I mean it. Everything is a weapon in this game. Pipes, glass, barrels, whatever. Your allies are NOT scripted; they navigate the terrain according to the enemies' movements and agression. The enemies work as a team and create some head-scratching scenarios for even the most hardcore gamer. Level design is superb and original. I never have and probably never will see anything quite like its deserted city of a setting.  TECHNICAL  Graphics and sound... hmmmm... The voice acting, storyline, and script are all top-notch, the music fitting, and the sound effects well-produced. The ragdoll physics engine utilized here is the most entertainingly realistic I have seen in quite some time. The graphics, while not quite as perfected as Doom 3's, are very detailed, reminiscient of a redone Far-Cry. Still, the way the generate the environments makes me want to live in City 17. Truly innovative, but as said before, the techinicality comes secondary to its extrodinary gameplay. Technical aspects are not as well done as Doom 3, on par with Halo 2, and still top-of-the-line.  DOWNFALLS  Packaging, for one. The box contains: 5 CDs, one slip of paper. No instruction manual? Not that I need one, but I think they're fun to read. Come on, at fifty-four bucks a pop, I want an instruction manual. I think I deserve one.  You need to register online with a steam account. Huh? What the crap? Who thought of this? There's no practicality here... why did we add this one? At about 20-45 minutes of installation time, the last thing we needed was to register it online and think of a username BEFORE single player offline mode can be used. Dispense with the unnecessary and let us play. Please?  Ummm... I think that's it.  COOL THINGS:  You can change difficulty settings at any point IN-GAME. Cool. Who though of that? Probably some genius.  Widescreen. YES! THAT is a cool feature. Who wouldn't want widescreen?  Ragdoll physics. Freakin' hilarious. They seriously make the game so much better. Why wouldn't you want to send civilians through the air like projectile missles through mid-iraqi airspace?  Weapon choice. I love every single weapon, from the crowbaar to the RPG. Even the pistol rocks, which is strange because it usually gets turned into a glorified capgun.  Counterstrike source. HEHE. Really cool feature for level designers or programmers. Otherwise, yawn.  BOTTOM LINE  Indispensible. Must-have for any collection. You won't regret buying this one unless you're blind. It lacks a few things, but the game itself makes up for any flaws.	1
You must register online before you can even play offline.  This is ludicrous.  This is also a very disturbing trend for a game - if you buy this one, you can expect to see more games use a similar scheme.  What happens once you uninstall the game and it is no longer even supported years doen the road?  You are out of luck.  They could just as easily decide to stop supporting it once the next version is out and force you to upgrade.  Stop the madness now before it gets out of hand or we will all come to regret it and pc gaming will be choked out of existence.	-1
OK... the out-of-box experience left a lot to be desired, much like people trying to play Joint Operations online the very first day it came out.  Here's a tip:  Reboot after the install.  Then register via Steam and unlock the game.  Getting started was the hardest part.  Steam is a download program which is required to be installed in order to play the game.  If Steam is down, you still have the option to play the game offline, but only after you've successfully registered the game online.  It's a pain in the butt, and hopefully nobody else will use this system in the future.  Once you're in the game, you're in for a treat.  EVERYTHING about the game is top-notch.  I'm not even running it on a high-end machine (by today's standards) and it looks great.  The sound is also very, very realistic.  If you don't have the latest, cutting-edge hardware, you may experience slightly longer load times, a few audio hiccups while the next level starts, and scaled-back graphics... but that's about the worst of it.  If you have a brand-new machine, prepare yourself for a flawless, fluid, ultra-realistic gaming experience.  If you can remember the hype surrounding Doom III, and then felt disappointed by the lack of original gameplay, rest assured - this is not Doom III.  The look, feel, story, and overall gameplay will make HL2 really set itself apart from D3.  Don't get me wrong, D3 has it's place on my hard drive and won't be taken off any time soon.  But HL2 will have me glued to my PC a little longer than D3 ever did, and I can use my flashlight and gun at the same time!  If you enjoyed the original, you'll enjoy the sequel.	1
Like a great many number of gamers excited about the release of hl2, i was online at midnite (PST not EST) to unlock my copy of hl2.  I thought i'd only play for a few minutes to see the intro movie and get an idea of how cool or not cool it turned out.  45 minutes later, I'm trying to pry my hands off the mouse to go to sleep.  My initial reaction to the game was a sense of returning home.  The characters look amazing, but are very familiar too.  Gamespot wrote a long report on valve / vivendi with many interviews with Gabe, and one thing really stuck with me, which was Valve's Kabal process and the question "how long has it been since something cool happened?".  A lot of manufacturers have built good games.  But to make a game truly great, you need an ebb and flow to the adrenelin and a sense of exhileration now and again.  HL2 has done this and Valve has really mastered the cinematic feel of this game.   * S P O I L E R S *  Playing through levels through the past few days, I've happily noticed that anytime i'm just about tired of the game, it takes a sharp turn.  Playing last nite I thought... man i'm tired of shooting things, and just then i was put on a boat to drive through a river.  When i'm gettin' tired of my boat, pow, i'm playing catch with a robotic dog.  Just a lot of fun.  And just around the time i'm gettin' tired of my guns, pow, new gun to play with.  :D   * END SPOILERS *  Anyways, if you haven't gotten yourself a copy from Amazon, or from Steam, (CDs are great backups), grab one and set aside around 4 hours to play.  I'm only around 8 hours into the game and I can tell that this one is a definite hit.  p.s. ppl have been complaining alot about half-life2, but few really whine about the game.  If you want to complain about valve/steam/vivendi, that's fine...  But don't tarnish hl2's name.  It's obvious that it was put together by some people who truly care about delivering a fun and enjoyable game; one that is in a genre all on its own.	1
Not a comment on the substance of the game, but just a note of caution to buyers:  even though this is an "offline" game, you need to be connected to the internet to play the game, in any mode.  Why?  Because the creators/publishers are paranoid about piracy --- so the game discs you are buying do not contain all the files needed to play the game.  In order to get these needed files, you need to download them from the creator's website on the internet.  On launch day, this was taking 4-8 hours to do.  In addition, after the files are downloaded, you need to register the game at the website before it will allow you to play it when you are not connected to the internet -- and that registration line can be long and slow!  And this is for the OFFLINE portion of the game, not the multiplayer portion.  The retail box apparently says "internet connection required".  They mean this folks -- NOT just for multiplayer!  You need to set aside several internet-connected hours in order to download the remaining files and register the game before you can play one second of it offline.  Booo!  Hiss!  The creators and publishers here are putting their own paranoid security above the ability of gamers to play their offline games in peace, without having to deal with the lag associated with online games.  Poor show indeed, Valve and Vivendi, poor show!	-1
Half Life 2 is possibly the best game ever made. This game is truly a work of art. The graphics are gorgeous, the story is compelling, the environment and physics are superb, but the whole game is RUINED by the steam log-on process.  After you install the game you have to log on to a Steam server to unlock it. This takes 30 mins - 1 hour. I don't mind this if it keeps people from illegally copying the game. Here's the bad part, every single time you want to play the game you have to logon to the Steam servers. TO PLAY A SINGLE PLAYER GAME YOU HAVE TO LOG ON TO A FREAKING SERVER. This is ridiculous. With millions and millions of people trying to play the game every night it can take forever to log on.....if you ever get on.  Don't buy this game. Save yourself the money and time because you won't be able to get on the Steam Servers.	-1
I stopped keeping time after 2am so I can't be sure what hour it is, nor can I tell you when I ran out of the cannister of Malt Balls and Peanut M&M's I brought as supplementation.  What I can tell you however (in the humble opinion of a dedicated PC gamer for 15 years), is that Half Life 2 is the the most mind blowing game I've ever played.  I was at E3 with my pyscho gaming buddy cleaning the Pizza flavored drool off his chin when we got a preview of HL2.  Like most, I counted the days, cursed Valve and Sierra for delay after delay, put all my faith and hope into Doom 3, was underwhelmed, went back to playing Desert Combat...basically went insane with anticipation.  In the brief moments before firing up HL2 for the first time, I was hopeful, but expecting to be dissapointed.  And I was.  Really, no multi-player!  I'm one of those that have an absolute allergy to single-player games.  Small beads of angry sweat began to form on my back...  But I soldiered on, and in:  10 minutes I was impressed,  at 30 minutes I was completely immersed,  at 1 hour chills were running up and down my spine, and occasional girlish yelps of horror began emanating from my pitch dark office...  ...by the third hour I came to the conclusion that HL2 was/is the most impressive game software I've ever had the privilege of living in.  Some highlights:  1.  The engine is truly revolutionary.  Doom 3 has a darn good engine, HL2 in my opinion is vastly better.  Indoor AND outdoor environments are near photo-realistic (I have a 3.2GHZ w/ 1GB RAM), the physics are jaw-dropping AND deeply integrated into the play of the game, texture and lighting, faces, water, you name it, this engine is now The Standard.  2.  Vehicles.  Well, not only do they have them, they're really fun to operate (or be chased by as the case may be).  3.  The Gravity Gun.  This weapon comes later in the game, and in my humble opinion, is easily the most fun weapon I've ever used.  Picking up and throwing items, using it to activate latent elements of the environment (often as weapons) is unbelievably fun.  Which brings me to:  4.  Humor.  This game has some really funny moments.  I almost busted a gut when I ran out of heavy/sharp things to fire at zombified creatures that were teaming up on me in close quarters.  I desperately pulled over a large can of paint, fired, and splattered huge gobs of white paint all over their (now more upset) faces.  I died, but I died laughing.  And finally:  5.  Immersion.  The screams were obvious signs of immersion, but beyond that, I noticed myself making facial expressions of anger, empathy, anticipation...all throughout the game I found myself genuinely caring.  That's a first for me.  I really could go on and on, but I can't, literally, I fear that dawn isn't far from my window and I'd like to pretend that I myself won't be a zombie tomorrow.  Enjoy,  Christian Hunter  Santa Barbara, California	1
As some reveiwers have already mentioned, Half-Life 2 requires registration on a program called Steam. Well, to make a long story short, I've spent my entire day salivating over a mere taste of the game I just forked over $55 to play, but instead of battling aliens in City 17, I'm battling network problems that Valve should have anticipated... but that's absurd because I want the single player campaign, and my internet connection (etc etc) shouldn't even be an issue.  Most games average $39.99 new, but no, Valve demanded $55 (as did Doom 3 and Diablo 2 and all those overhyped "we're doing you a favor letting you buy this masterpiece at all" games), and to add insult to injury I can't even play what I paid good money for. I don't know what the game is like, so I can't judge it -- but I can vent my frustration, as others have done (and are doing in increasing numbers), by informing potential buyers of all the pains that come with owning Half-Life 2. You shouldn't have to jump hoops when you've already paid, and to say I'm "steamed" (forgive the pun) is quite an understatement.  I'm showing Valve how much I appreciate this mess by selling my copy of Half-Life 2 and turning my back on it. I don't care how great PC Gamer thinks it is -- my principles of a consumer demand it.	-1
"Growman's" review says it all, and says it very well. This game is simply a masterpiece. I went to sleep at 1 AM EST, woke up and unlocked it at 3AM this morning the very second it became available, and found myself playing into the morning, completely losing myself in the game and forgetting that I had to be up at 6 AM once again.  The graphics are beautiful, the sounds amazing, and the gameplay superb. (Keep in mind that I am using a high-end PC, lower end PCs may have trouble with this one) If there is one game you get this year, make this it.	1
There was nothing new much in the Half-Life game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the Quake game engine, so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time? When Half-Life first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do at the time. (1)Story, (2)Story, (3)Story. Valve created Half-Life in a period of our lives when Area 51 was a hot topic among UFO researchers and the X-Files was beginning to become mainstream viewing. Alien based entertainment media was then a craze in the mid and late 1990's that was unprecedented since the 1950s. Smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for UFO enthusiasts came HALF-LIFE where YOU get to play as Gordon Freeman, a physics researchers who witnesses a freak accident in an Area 51 type facility. All hell breaks loose and YOU have to survive. No cut scenes. No initial story. No explanation. You where just there and you had to escape. Cue interactive characters that could follow you around, say a few things and shoot monsters - maps rich in objects that you could break.  The GOOD NEWS is that Half-Life 2 is another world beyond HL1 and is like nothing you have ever played before! This IS the first person shooter 'Game of games', hands down, period. As a stand alone game, HL2 is 100% pure adrenaline, no holds bard, from start to finish. If you own a PC then own HL2 because the world will never be the same again. Half-Life 2 WILL destroy lives, educations and marriages and...  ...IT IS NOT A GAME!  ... or at least that is the net result. This thing was real. Forget Doom 3, FarCry or any of the best pixel pushers out there - HL2 just mashes `em into the ground and then sets off an amazing fireworks display to welcome you back. How many games within the first two levels have you literally calling friends, family and neighbours to have a look at it? You must LIVE this game.  Okay so at 9:02 I unlocked HL2 and got playing. I have simply not stopped except to write this. Maybe Farcry has the edge on jungle texture, but nowhere else will you see anything as amazing as City 17. The game starts right where the previous one left off, as you are dumped into this futuristic eastern European city like something out of 1984 following a brief meeting with the GMAN. 100% Orwell. Basically you learn that citizens are slowly going missing from City 17 and you must meet up with old friends (scientists from the first game including security guard Barney) and as soon as your teleporter goes wonky you are landed right in on the action as soldiers storm apartments looking for you. On the run you manage to land a hovercraft and go on to tear through flood channels ramping over things and seeing full scale battlecraft fly overhead... and when you hit them, bits break off and explode... slowly... so you give `em more heat... and more bits break off... and then they crash and burn with a roaaaaarrr! The gem of the game though is when you play with DOG (wait till you see this thing) and learn a neat trick with a new weapon called the Gravity gun. Now this thing is unreal because you can lift anything and send it flying in the direction of some bad guy. Not to spoil to fun but let a few disc saws whirl and watch what happens to the bad guys or even throw a petrol canister into a group of zombies and hear them scream. The animation is hyper-realistic and your fps will match your heartbeat. This is THE REAL DEAL.  The characters all have their own unique personality and walk, talk and act differently. The cut scenes all look great and are done in 1st person as you walk around the event. Like its predecessor, each level is designed with plenty of tasks to do, puzzles to solve and bad guys to mow down. There is also team play in this one like in HL1 but is more organized with much more firepower. Anyway I will not spoil the story for you (basically join the resistance in City 17 and win the war) but like I said if you have a thing for 1984, conspiracy theory or the New World Order, then HL2 has it all! HL2 also borrows HUGELY from other games and films you have seen, but that just makes it all the better because it seems somewhat familiar, yet ABSOLUTELY NEW.  The bottom line is that is, hands down, the best 1st person shooter probably for the next 4 years or so. I seriously doubt anything, ANYTHING, in the next 24 months is going to be patch on this experience.  Pros:  - It does not feel like a game. It feels real. - Totally immersion in a film-like environment. - Truly massive maps with PLENTY to do. - Action, action, action, non-stop. - Lots and lots of variation in the gameplay. - GRAVITY GUN! - A real interesting futuristic story - The best 1st person shooter (maybe game) ever. - Counter-Strike: Source comes with it.  Cons: (Benchmark on a 3ghz P4, 1GB RAM, RADEON 9800Pro 256mb) - Sometimes you will wait more than 60 seconds between load times. - Most load times are greater than 15 seconds. - Even a high-end machine gets challenged by this game. - Valve and Vivendi really botched the marketing but that aside HL2 is EVERYTHING YOU COULD EXPECT AND A LOT LOT MORE.  NOTE : You need an internet connection to validate it. You need to download and install STEAM to do this. IT IS FREE apart from the internet costs. The GAME was not pirated before release! It worked!	1
...You heard me.  Halo i s better since it is funner, and the pultiplayer is funer in halo.  Halo 2 is even better.  Go XBOX! oh yeah	1
Some people recently seem confused about Amazon.com's price reduction.  But in reality, the makers of Half Life 2 suggest you use their Steam Power ([...]) to download Half Life 2 when it comes out.	1
when I got the 1st Half-Life, I thought to myself; Is this going to be another mediocre shooter?. Boy was I wrong. After hearing of a sequel, and there had to be, I was ecstatic. Looking at the game now, I'm glad that Valve and Sierra took their time with this game. The visuals are stunning and georgeous, even though you might not pay attention to detail with the ammount of action going on. The A.I. is very smart. Try to block a door and they'll try to break in a window to get to you. There are even more puzzles in this game than in the 1st one.  But if you don't believe me, See what popular gamer magazines had to say:    PC Gamer: 98% - "Surpasses Half-Life in every way. Arguably the best game ever made."    Game Informer: "Nothing will be the same."    CNN.com: "Blows away the competition."    2003 E3 Expo: "A marvel in the making."	1
Half Life 2 may be okay for a game that's over a year old.  But the problem is that the general public has never played it.  It's aging FAST.  When (or if) it finally comes out, it will be rather dated and unimpressive.  The other problem is that the enthusiasm for this game peaked about eight months ago and has been in decline ever since.  Timing is very important in game releasing and I think HL2 missed the mark by a long shot  I hope it will come out, and I probably will purchase it.  If so, I will revise my review accordingly.  As for now, it is turning out to be one of the biggest disappointments in recent PC game history.  Not September 15  Now  November 1, 2004  We shall see.  Maybe for Christmas THIS year.	-1
Right off the bat I've never, EVER, heard of this game at all!  What's up with that?  After playing the original, which is great(back in 98), I was so ready to get that sequal.  Who can deny the chaos that's going to come when it comes out?! I'm not sure if it will suceed over the original but who knows?  I'll tell you... only Valve knows these answers and their keeping it as a suprise.  I HATE SUPRISES!!! Oh sure they've gave out hints and treats but that isn't enough for an enthusiest like me!  So... if anyone knows, TRUELY knows, when this game is coming please tell me!  I've got to know if it will work on my computer.	-1
yeah i finished this game over 6 months ago but i was bored so i just felt like reviewing it.  This game kicks ass, good grapihcs, good game play, and good everything else.	1
Aaaah... What a magicall year for gamers. Quake 4 announced, Doom III & Half-Life 2 on the way, and Duke Forever... uhm... well... Half-Life being one of the best games ever to take place on mine and any others hard-drives was bound to a sequel. But, what will we recive? One thing is certain, the game will be powered by one of the wildest graphics engines ever. Visuals only seen in movies, sound effects to droll for, kick-ass much environment interactivity... But... Can Valve keep up with the success of the original? Only time will see...	1
The world of first-person shooting games was revolutionized in 1998 when Half-Life hit the mainstream.  Featuring a slew of smooth graphics, a huge three-dimensional environment, and an interesting arsenal of weaponry, Half-Life was bound for greatness.  Since its conception, several modifications have been created, including total game revamps like Counterstrike and Team Fortress Classic.  Now, Sierra has decided enough time has passed since their original creation, and are onto bigger and better things. I base this information from the 25-minute video shown from the debut at E3 of 2003 that showcased Half-Life 2 to the fullest.  Graphically, no other first-person shooter has ever looked so good.  The characters have "rag doll" physics, meaning when a body hits the ground, its arms and legs flail lifelessly.  Barrels float in the water, and splinters fly from a section of wood that is shot by bullets.  The realism is astonishing. The opening sequence features the G-man from the last title that greets you in the end to offer you a position to work for him, or to face a fate "you have no chance of surviving."  The programmers inform us that the G-man has over twenty separate "muscles" in his face that change when he talks, or has emotional responses. The A.I. is revolutionary.  During a street combat, you find yourself being bombarded by enemy fire, while several resistance fighters alongside you are trying to fight back.  The computer-controlled characters wait for prime opportunities to move and counterattack when their opposition isn't attacking them.  A.I. of this calibre has never been seen before. In addition to the classic weapons we've seen (with updated graphics and sound effects, of course), new revolutionary ways of dispatching enemies await the classic hero Gordon Freeman. So, whenever Sierra decides to release this game (if the actual date isn't pushed back again), we'll get to see the mystic wonders of the world of Half-Life once again.  Only this time, it's personal.	1
In the 25min high def video i saw, my jaw dropped and i had to pick up the pieces one by one. As the mysterious G-man says at the end of it : "Well, well, Mr. Freeman, isn't it just like...ooold times?" This phrase, for some reason, is the one that told me most :" this game is gonna kick major ass." I think that Half-life is probably the greatest pc game ever made, even maybe the best game ever made. So these "old times" are such a great memory that this sentence pretty much sums up how good hl2 is gonna be. I mean, the graphics for one, are so advanced it's going to take a long time for competitors to even broach that level. (except maybe for doom 3 devellopers, their graphics rip too) But the most impressive thing in hl2 is the physics engine. The way the player can intereact with teh environment is simply awe-inspiring. For exemple, when you see a guy take out a futuristic-orange-glowing-electromagnetic gun, and use it to levitate a wall radiator in front of them as a sheild, and tehn hurl it at the enemy like a massive wreck ball, you say to yourself: "This, is COOL."( for lack of better word, because there is no possible good description of the feeling you get at that time) I sincerely hope that it will not have the same fate as other recent sequels, like jak 2, which tried to add some to their very good first opus, thus making it confusing, rough and left a feeling of unfinished in the gamers mouth. I hope that hlf life 2, will be not only a good looking game, but a good playing game as well. But since valve has pretty much turned out only great games, i trust them for this one. "And we thought Black Mesa was bad..."	1
This game will PWN you, i've had a chance to see it in action and wow, i get goose bumps everytime i see the video. My expected release date of the game is one year from the announced release date, since with half-life it was one year from thats expected release date, it would only make sense that this is whats going to happen will this. expected release: Sept. 30th 2004.	1
Of my collection of Game Cube games, this is DEFINETLY not my favorite.  The adventures are not fun, as the action and the combat is stale and awkward.  The attacks are not coordinated and the enemies are plain.  The graphics are ordinary, certaintly not anything special.  The multi-player absoulety stinks.  With four seperate screens it is absoulely confusing and the four-fold screens are so small, little can be seen.  A much better action game would be Super Smash Melee.	-1
Mystic Heroes is a very good game. The first-player mode is a series of battles in which you choose one of four characters with unique strengths and battle your way through the plot. Aside from the actual thrill of battling through hordes of monsters, the interesting part is the Runestones; you find them in various levels and they give you a wide range of magical abilties. Although the single-player is short, it has a lot of replay value with three different diffictulty levels, four characters to choose from and many Runestones to collect. The truely fantastic part of Mystic Heroes, though, is the multi-player. The screen is split into four screens, and each player is unleashed in seperate locations in a land full of baddies. Teamwork is essential, and it's exciting and challenging. It's almost like the game Gauntlet, only a lot more fun. If you have a bunch of friends who love party games, this is the game for you! Although the single-player of Mystic Heroes is pretty good, unless you have a bunch of Gamecube-playing friends or siblings you won't uncover the true beauty of the game. I highly recommend this for anyone who likes adventure or party games.	1
Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Saga combines the RTS (real-time strategy) Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its Episode II mission expansion Clone Campaigns in a single package. This sells for less together than they did (or do) apart, so make sure its SAGA.  Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Saga challenges using over 50 battle campaigns from the classic and prequel Star Wars universe EXCLUDING Episode III., this predates that prequel. But it is sort of the poor-man's EMPIRES @ WAR, which does include the complete SAGA, but is also very expensive right now, this is a good game to hold you over until EMPIRES becomes more affordable.  Using the award-winning Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings game engine, Battlegrounds Saga allows players to deploy armies of Storm Troopers, Clones, Naboo, Battle Droids, Rebels, Gungans, and Wookiees. Players manage their units, structures, and resources in single- or multiplayer campaigns on Tatooine, Naboo, Endor, Hoth, and Geonosis. Play can be set in the prequel era of the SW SAGA up the Clone Wars, or original SW Trilogy settings controling Vader and his forces, and a post-FILM setting of the NEW REPUBLIC as seen in the SW NOVELS using LEIA and the other ex-rebels to battle the remnants of the Galactic Empire. Specific film characters (Like Han and Chewy)and book/COMIC  characters (like MARA JADE & DARK TROOPERS) make appearances and can be controled. Less specific characters (like JEDI & SITH KNIGHTS) can be created and controlled.  One of the unique features for advanced gamers, that is rarely called attention to, is the ability to construct your own "BATTLEGROUND" for actual use. You populate the field with your own mechanized armies (AT-ATs, Ties and more), characters, as well and master the scenerio settings themselves; including: text prompts that you pen your own text prompts, sculpt the landscape buildings it to suit the story, player-settings and sides offerings. This is a fun feature you won't find in EMIPIRES @ WAR.  Like most engines of this kind, once you get a feel for the hot keys and short-cuts to managing your forces, figuring out what to build & the most economical way to use your buiding resources (because they are the key to winning) you will rapidly become more successful.	1
it lags a lot in graphics. the gameplay is neither good. interesting if you want to know more about the Star Wars stories from Episodes I, II, IV, V, & VI. i'd suggest to wait for the new RTS "Star Wars Empire at War" coming in 2005 made by the creators of "Command & Conquer Generals" (i'm not talking about publisher EA or Electronic Arts, i'm talking about the once Westwood Studios' programmers)	-1
this game is far better than 2k2 because they have made some minor, but critical changes to the game. in 2k2 the A.I. system was virtually impossible to beat an i hated that. also in 2k2 the free throws were impossible as well. i just think that there are far move improvements in this game than before. like when i play 2k3 i actually get close scores to the computer than in 2k2 i used to loose by a whole lot. overall i would highly recommend this game because is a lot better that it's predecessor, AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE!!	1
NBA 2K3 is slow paced and more of a simulation. While not much has changed, it does have an ESPN license, and it has player intros and real coaches. However the stupid thing is there is no edit number. I traded ePat to the Lakers, and they gave him number 0, since Jesus has 8. I wanted him to wear 53, but there is no way to change it. I like how you run plays on this game, the players respond really well. Another new thing they added is that you can pass while dunking, and also alter your shot, so you can pull of switching hands in mid-air and stuff like that. Great game, it is a must have for NBA fans.	1
I bought this game because is awesome and it's a game with different kinds of adventures	1
Very fun cartoony game. I played this at my cousin's house when I was about 13. I couldn't find this ANYWHERE other than here. This game is very fun. Not quite sure why, but it just is!	1
Samus Aran, heroin of the first three Metroid games in the series. It seems like she destoryed the Metroid enemy but...did she? In No. 2, she just almost killed the entire Metroid population but a few survived. Samus thought she'd rid the world of the pesky little devils but now, it's time to take care of the little buggers once more. The last game was one the Super Nintendo system and was a total bust in Japan but the sales here sky-rocketed! The reason no new metroid game came out was because of the Japanese public. But we clamored for another new Metroid. Many people were upset of Samus getting put into first-person view! Notice I didn't say shooter because this game is so far from that genre, it shouldn't be disposed because of it's first-person view. But, it looks like the game was made to be put into a 3-D universe. It looks another classic game of the Metroid series is going to strike the 'Cube...	1
Like the title says, but this maybe a part of the whole challenge. My son and I did have fun trying to learn though.	1
Well this is one of those weird racing games that the cars talk but it just has words at the bottom of the screen. It is a little kids game but a long time ago it was the best. It does not have very good graphics but it did come out in 2001. The pourpose of this game is that there is a president that quits his job and he will give it to whoever wins the grand prix. There is many parts on this game to buy to fix up ur car and they r not cheap. There is different towns to go to and the town that u live in u start it by talking to people that want to move or start a buisness there and as soon as u complete it u will get a stamp. There is a stamp book that has 100 stamps in it and as soon as u fill it up u beat the game. And they r not easy to get either, each town has about eight stamps and here is one of the things u have to do to get a stamp, become president, meet all of the people in whatever town, and many more. U can choose whoever u want to join ur team to get more money when u race. But u can only choose two people. Each race track has a different money award for first seconed, and third. While u race or just drive around town u can run out of gas and the bigger the engine or the more turbo u use the faster u run out, and to fill it back up u either go into any store or house or if u r racing there is a pit stop to go to. U can play on multiplayer too so u can either do mini games or actually race. There r hundreds of bodies to buy and u can paint them however u like. There is so many things to do in this game and it takes a long time to beat but it is not that hard. If u like Animal crossing and racing u will like this game allot. It is one of my favorite games for the ps2.	1
Great for my collection	1
10 for 10	1
This is one of the greatest games ever made. Graphics aren't bad, even in 2017 they are still rather acceptable. The music tracks are amazingly good, I'd rate the music in this game 10/10.  Although the game looks and plays a bit like a "First Person Shooter", the game is marketed as "First Person Adventure". You must adventure the Planet of Tallon IV to unravel the mystery of the meteorite and how the space pirates come into play. You will have to use your wits to get through the game and progress. You will get lost if not paying attention to the hints and details your scanner gives you. So don't neglect your scanner!  I suggest picking up this game, along with Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.	1
It is Great!	1
Awesome game, definitely worth getting with the original box art and manual well maintained if you're a collector	1
Awesome game, feels great ro relive childhood memories :)	1
While i do like echos more This one is much easier With the exception of the stupid pirate snow base & the other base. Both are challenge & full of enemies Unlimited ammo Travaling back & forth is tedious Throwing in red phazon is a joke cause it hurts you The fission metroid are raging annoying	-1
Note: This is a review of the Wii version of this game  Metroid is one of the most critically acclaimed video game series not only for Nintendo, but for all of gaming. The first game helped to define the genre known as Metroidvania (Metroid and Castlevania). The third entry in the series, Super Metroid, received exceptionally high reviews, with critics lauding the exploration, hidden items, sense of isolation, bosses, and the ending, which is still one of my favorite endings in any video game. With all of the success that the series had, why would Nintendo skip over the entire Nintendo 64 generation, aside from Samuss appearance in Super Smash Bros? Not only did they wait 8 years to release another Metroid game, but it was licensed to a then unknown North American developer, Retro Studios. To add even more confusion, they changed the gameplay from a 2D sidescroller to a first-person perspective. Was this the right decision for Nintendo? It was one of their best decisions.  What This Game is All About:  The game is played from Samus Arans first-person perspective, an intergalactic bounty hunter with a very powerful Power Suit. The prologue has Samus receiving a distress signal from the Space Frigate Orpheon. So, Samus takes her spaceship and heads over to see what has happened. After exploring the frigate and defeating a mutated alien, the frigate starts a destruction timer, and Samus must escape. As Samus is escaping, she encounters Ridley, her arch-nemesis and the leader of the Space Pirates. Once Samus does escape, she lands on the nearby planet, Tallon IV. Unfortunately, she has lost all of her upgrades because of the explosion. This is a unique gameplay aspect: having the player start with roughly half of the upgrades, only to lose them right away. It gives the player a nice tease for what is to come.   The rest of the game has Samus exploring various areas of Tallon IV to uncover the Space Pirates plans and stop it, along with uncovering the mysterious secrets of the Chozo civilization that once lived here. It is a great premise and one that really pumps up the player to start the grand adventure.  Gameplay:  The transition from a 2D perspective to a first-person perspective is phenomenal. You get to see everything from Samuss point-of-view, from the onslaught of enemies to the water dripping off of her after coming above water. It is a truly immersive experience that helps to add depth to the gameplay.   The controls are fantastic, with the player using various buttons to activate weapons, a morph ball, and more. The game has The Legend of Zeldas trademark lock-on feature, which greatly helps the player when combating enemies. The Wii remote is used to aim, which is surprisingly well done. I still prefer dual-analog controls ever so slightly, but these are still remarkable and probably the best in any Wii game. Since the original Gamecube version didn't use dual-analog controls, this is a great improvement.   The game is all about exploration, with Samus having to attain certain upgrades for her Power Suit in order to gain access to new areas in the game. The sense of accomplishment from finding a brand new suit, to just a small missile expansion pack is immensely rewarding, rivaling that of the Zelda series item finding. The player can find suit upgrades, different beams for the Arm Cannon, Energy Tanks to increase the maximum health, missile expansions, Power Bomb expansions, and still more. The game has a total of 100 different items for the player to collect, and it is a great satisfaction to get more and more.   The action in this game is intense and frightening, with different alien species trying to kill Samus, along with the evil Space Pirates. The Space Pirates in particular are very intelligent and try to not only dodge Samus, but also to team up and corner her, making every encounter drive you to the edge of your seat. Sometimes, the enemies get repetitive when re-exploring the same areas, but it is also fun to try out the new toys on them.   One of the games slight problems is backtracking, which there is a lot of. Granted, I had to encounter more than the average player because I would go to the nearest save point every time that I got an item, but it was still a lot. There are elevators spread out the areas, but a fast travel feature wouldve been nice.   The game also has one of gamings worst gameplay types: first-person platforming. This is just awful, and the main reason that this game doesnt get a slightly higher score. It just isn't fun, mainly because it is hard to judge where you are jumping. It gets slightly better when Samus receives the double jump, but it is still annoying.   The game also has a unique scanning feature, where the player can scan enemies and the environment to learn more about them. These are all recorded in a logbook in the pause menu. This is a great addition, especially when scanning bosses to try to uncover their secrets. I got a little bit sick of it by the time that I finished the game, but the logbooks carry over to a new game, so I won't have to scan everything again. This was a small, but very pleasing addition to the Wii version.   Speaking of bosses, the bosses in this game are some of my favorite. Theres a giant alien on the frigate, a giant and poisonous plant with large tentacles, an elite Space Pirate, along with the epic battle with Mecha Ridley, which is one of my favorite battles in any video game, and still more. The game did a fantastic job of building up the hype to face Ridley, with Samus sometimes seeing him fly throughout the sky in one of the games cutscenes. Each boss has weaknesses that the player must uncover, and the scanning visor makes this very fun. It helps enough, but doesnt spoil too much.   The gameplay isn't perfect, with platforming and backtracking elements being slightly annoying, but nothing beats the satisfaction of fully-upgrading Samus and pummeling old enemies and unlocking new areas. The gameplay is truly remarkable in this game, and quite possibly the best use of the Wiis motion controls.  Story:  The game has a way of telling the story that is very different from most video games. In order to actually know what is going on in the game, the player must scan certain areas in the environment. These could be a Space Pirate log, showing the player their plans on Tallon IV, or an ancient Chozo glyph that explains their past civilization and why they are no longer here. There isn't much of a conventional narrative, but uncovering these logs and glyphs were some of my favorite parts in the game. I love great narratives in my games, but I loved the way that Retro Studios implemented the story into scans. Players who don't scan often are missing out.  Design:  This game has probably the best atmosphere in any game ever created. As soon as I landed on Tallon IV, I knew that I was in for a treat. For a game created in 2002, the graphics have held up amazingly. The game still looks gorgeous to this day. The water soaking off of Samuss visor, the reflection of her eyes in certain scenarios, and the games beautiful in-game engine cutscenes are fantastic to look at. Retro Studios made a great decision in keeping the cutscenes in 3rd-person, and then quickly reverting back to first-person for the gameplay. You cant really describe great atmosphere, but this game is the best of the best.  Sound:  To complement a great atmosphere, the game includes one of gamings greatest soundtracks. Each area has a different vibe to it, and the music is very pleasing to the ears. The music is also one of gamings best, and you can unlock them at the main menu to listen to whenever the player chooses so. Great music complements a great atmosphere.  Difficulty:  The difficulty is almost perfect. It isn't too easy or hard. If the player does get stuck, they could always go exploring for better upgrades. The game also includes a hint system that can be toggled on and off. I only died twice during the game, but I never felt like my hand was being held. It was a balanced difficulty, and there are harder options for those who want it, although they are completely optional.  Replay Value:  The game took me about 25 hours to complete and it was amazing. The game also carries over the third games credit system to unlock pieces of artwork and musical themes at the main menu. The real reason for replaying the game, however, is just because it is so fun. Although the Metroid games are known for their speed runs, I would never want to run through this game, especially with how immersive it was.  Final Judgment: Only a few nitpicks keep this game from a max rating. It is, by far, one of my favorite video game experiences ever. The Wii version is the first version that I played of this, and aside from graphics, which aren't terrible by any means and still look great, it could be played as if it was a new game. It is an amazing game and very RECOMMENDED. Go buy it. NOW FINAL SCORE= 9.5	1
Great	1
Outstanding game. Looks great, is incredibly fun, just not crazy about the Chozo artifacts.	1
WOW. Just wow. There's a certain feel about this game I can't explain. How the power beam fires exactly how fast you smash the button, how the gameplay is so damn smooth, or just how the game is literally flawless. Like flawless. There aren't many titles like this that implement such a deep intriquite feel almost like operating an actual machine or drone. 10/10	1
Metroid Prime is a great video game and a classic! As a metroid fan this game is awesome and very addicting!	1
My son loves this game!	1
Works great, came quickly all the way to Alaska. Stoked. Would buy from them again!	1
Disc looks amazing, runs perfect and arrived on time.	1
This is an awesome game and brings back memories. It arrived on time and I was happy with the quality of the game case and the the disc was in good condition as well	1
one of the best games	1
This product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. Game play is good. Thanks	1
This game is an amazing first person shooter! It's brilliant and the upgrades for Samus's suits are amazing! The puzzles and battle sequences are a blast!! It's also amazing how you have to uncover the story yourself using her scanner on her visor!!	1
it ok	1
I previously owned NBA Inside Drive 2002.  It was fun, but lost its appeal quickly because there was no progression of the game.  The players skills remained unchanged no matter how much you played.  The 2003 version allows you to create your own players, choose the skills and appearance of that player, and have that player improve from game to game.  You can turn a rookie 3rd string point guard into scoring title all-star over the course of a couple of seasons.  The overall gameplay, sound, and graphics seem slightly improved over 2002.  But it is the dynamic player performance and create a player additions that give this game a great improvement in longevity. A strong recomendation!	1
The place I ordered it from gave me a game that was in almost mint condition. but not only did the disc and package look god the games graphics are great Id say its the best looking game on the gamecube. Even if you don't like metroid buy this game its an amazing puzzle shooter	1
Game is in great condition and it plays just as it should. Worked perfectly on both my Gamecube and Wii.  Five Stars	1
If you like FPS games then this game is for you there is much to be done in this game like collect power ups for your suit, Missiles, Energy Tanks, Visors all the normal stuff within a Metroid game but there is a lot of backtracking which can get annoying especially if you get a new power up and couldn't access or go through a certain door you will have to go back and get it, yeah I know it sucks but it's worth it once you collect all the pick ups you'll be ready to destroy anything in your path the Plasma beam is a killer and the Ice missiles help a lot so keep stocked up on Missiles and be sure to collect all the Energy tanks you'll need them for the last boss this is a fun game once you complete it and well worth your time it ends up at the top of most peoples list of Top 10 GameCube games but overall it's one of the greatest games of all time so pick it up and get ready to explore space like no other bounty Hunter.	1
video game for an older system. It is a god game. Fun to play. Reminds me of when I was a kid. Decent graphics for the age of the game.	1
bought for my fiancee who is a big metroid fan but hadnt played yet. said it was great so im writing good review. said the controls took some time getting used to but once you start really playing the story is great and game sucks you in and leaves you wanting more.	1
I owned this game when I was younger and clearly never had the patience. I virtually never got past the beginning and didn't like the game very much. Now, twelve years later I find it here and decide to get it again to find out that it is amazing! Wish I wasn't and idiot when I was a kid because I missed out but now I'm ready to beat it in full.	1
Easily one of my favorite titles for the Nintendo Gamecube. This Metroid game was a bit different then ones from the past. Samus made the epic jump from 2D sidescroller to first person shooter.	1
i have to say the graphics are horrible but the gameplay is good (at some point it will get boring) if you don't like dbz or haven't seen the show it will be about a rating of 2 but if you like the show you will like this it even has super saiyian 3 and 4 it hasaround 15 playable charecters including bad guys	1
must get if you like fighting games or dbz on my list go to mortal kombat deadly alliance to see my list	1
This is a game that revolves entirly around the story of Dragon Ball Z, from Vegeta to MAjin Buu this game attempts to cover it all in an RPG style.  THere is a change though, the battles are conducted in the card game manner that is a growing rage in many places.  So in this style the cards are as such, attack, support, defense, and beam (there are probably more).  You start the game off as Gohan and latter switch between numerouse allies that are also in the series.  You are also given the option for battles as well as multiplayer mode with the link to link cable. OVerall this is a decent game that is in the same style as Pokemon Trading Card Game.  So with that said there is not much more to say. Graphics: 2 out of 5: For late Gameboy color more should of been done graphic wise. SOund: 3 out of 5: There is very little music but when there is it is about average. Control: 5 out of 5: YOur guy moves when you command him to and the ability to go through cards is simple enough. Fun Factor: 4 out of 5: This is not for everyone however if you are a die hard fan of the series and or into card games such as Pokemon or magic the Gathering than pick this up.	1
Others have already pointed out how this game excels, so I won't reiterate what's been said. It's a great game, and worth every penny. As a longtime Metroid fan I feel it's worth noting that the original North American release is arguably the best version of the game, as later versions (i.e. Player's Choice and PAL variants) had many exploits and sequence breaks patched to make the game more linear and guide the player along the path the designers originally conceived. Since nonlinearity has been something of a hallmark of the 2D Metroid games, and does much to enhance replayability and exploration potential, despite these fundamentally being the same game you'll get more bang with the original release NA release rather than the Player's Choice version even if it costs a bit more upfront.	1
This is the first first-person metroid game, and is absolutely amazing, love the graphics, the gameplay, the music, everybody needs to play this game.	1
The game is just as its called. Prime, its one of the best Metroid games i have ever played. if you have a Wii or Gamecube, get this game!	1
This is not a fantastic Gamecube experience. No, this is a fantastic experience in general. Everything from the ambient music, to the gunplay, to the puzzles just everything feels so right. Buy this game. Even better if you can get your hands on the Trilogy pack for the Wii.  Gamecubes are like $20 right now - buy one, and then buy this game. You will not be disappointed	1
I only just got the game delivered and im already in love with this game. It may not be the most recent of games but its good for its generation!  I recomend this for any first person shooter fan and gamecube owner if you don't already have it!	1
This is coming from someone whos been plying since Metroid NES. The controls are fluent and work well on a gamecube controller. Really captures what makes Metroid great but better.	1
One of the best of all time, without debate--this game is a masterpiece. Grab it if you have a gamecube, its the gamecubes BEST game, PERIOD barnone.	1
We got this because we enjoyed the original Metroid.  It is a fun and challenging game.  I would recommend it to those who like this genre	1
I probably shouldn't review it if I have never beat it, but it was a fun game, I liked it alot.	1
Words cannot express how much I love this game. This game is perfection, the controls while hard to get used to, are smooth as it should be, the graphics are obviously amazing, and pushes the gamecube to new heights, the gameplay pulls you into the experience like no other. DO NOT disregard this game because it is a "first person shooter" when you clearly haven't played it, because this game despite the look is NOT a first person shooter, it gets everything that was good from super metroid and the like and in my opinion, expands it even more. This whole game is a work of art, a true masterpiece from retro studios, and for the price tag of 4 dollars, this game is an absolute STEAL. Before you go out and buy it, I would see if you can get the original version of the game, look on the back of the disc and see if it says "players choice" on it, because if it does, then its not the original version, in the original version, you can sequence break, and if your into that, then hunt down the original version, otherwise this is just a great game anyways so just BUY IT NOOOOWW!	1
On the Nintendo 64, many of our favorite series were brought to life in 3D for the first time. Super Mario 64 wowed us with fully explorable three-dimensional levels, complete with multiple challenges in each. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time stole our hearts as one of the grandest, and most cherished stories of all time. Pokemon brought our addictive and collecting tendencies onto the big screen. But where was Metroid? You see, Nintendo wanted to make a 3D Metroid game badly. Even Yoshio Sakamoto, the series co-founder was very itnerested, but Sakamoto couldn't figure out how the player would control Samus with the N64 controller. Eventually, Shigeru Miyamoto visited with a new development team in Texas called Retro Studios. Sure, they're made a few very good Nintendo games as of today, but this was back in 1998, when they were literally unheard of. As it turned out, Retro was on board.. Nintendo decided that wanted it to be for their next system to come, the Gamecube however. At that time it didn't even have the code name "Dolphin"! So, they got to work, and eventually had a game that played somewhat similar to Other M, but Miyamoto intervened, scrapped all their work and changed it to a "First Person Adventure". Furthermore, 4 different Gamecube games were canceled entirely in order to focus on Metroid Prime. Was it worth it?  The Metroid Prime trilogy takes place between Metroid (or Zero Mission) and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Samus reveives a distress signal from a frigate called Orpheon, which also happens to be a space pirate ship. She arrives to discover that the crew has been slaughtered by their own genetically modified parasites. After destroying the parasite queen, a self destruct sequence initiates. On her way back to her own ship, a large electrical surge destroys most of her suit's capabilities (naturally). It is immediately after this, that she encounters Ridley, the space pirate leader she thought she had killed on Zebes. Ridley head towards a planet called Tallon VI, and so Samus gives chase. Upon landing, she finds that Orpheon has also crash landed on this planet. after a bit of exploration, she discovers that Chozo once inhabited this planet, but a meteorite crashed, contaminating the planet with a corrosive substance called Phazon and killing them off. Samus then sets off to take down the space pirates once more, but can she survive the Phazon herself?  Metroid Prime has great graphics, and effects for its time, but they have not aged well. Rough textures, low detail on certain enemies and pixelation are pretty common when you look at things up close. Despite this, the game is extremely atmospheric, mostly thanks to the music and the effects. As the game is in first person, you are actually looking out of Samus' visor, and it serves as the HUD. When you walk through steam, the visor fogs up. When an enemies explodes near you, blood may splatter onto your visor (it's all blue, or green). My personal favorite effect is when there is an explosion underwater, and the flash allows you to see Samus' reflection in the visor. Even the gun effects are great. For example, if you fire an ice shot, frost develops on the outside of the gun. The music is very atmospheric, low key, and fitting.  Samus is moved using only the control stick, and the C-stick is used for changing weapons. The D-pad is sued to change visors. You may be wondering how you can aim this way, but it is relatively simple. The R trigger locks onto enemies, and the A button is fire. Alternatively, you can hold down L to free aim, but you cannot move while doing this. If you feel this will be an issue for you, you should play this game on the Wii via New Play Control if you live in Asia, or via Metroid Prime Trilogy if you live elsewhere.  Despite involving a gun, and being in first person perspective, Metroid Prime is not a first person shooter. Rather, it is what Nintendo describes as a first person adventure. Combat is not at the forefront of this title, but rather puzzle solving and exploration are the main gameplay elements. Exploration is especially important, and something you will be doing a lot of. Just be sure to check your map as often as possible, or you will quickly become lost on Talon IV.  Metroid Prime is a great game, and a successful translation of a 2D series into 3D. Retro did an amazing job on their first game, and went on to create 2 sequels to Metroid Prime, 2 spin offs of it, Donkey Kong Country Returns, and Mario KArt 7. They are currently working on a Wii U title that is as yet un-named, but they have called it "A project everyone wants us to do."  Metroid Prime is a game that sucks you in, and doesn't let you go until you hit the power button. Over the last 9 years, I have created a total of 5 different game files on Metroid Prime. I only finished one of them, which was my most recent. You see, even though I continually gave up, got stuck, or became frustrated and quit, I always came back eventually until I finally completed this grand adventure. Is the game perfect? Not nearly, but is still a Gamecube icon. Did I mention that you can get this game at most used game stores for about $3? Yeah, I said $3.	1
Ok I got this game 2 christmases ago and must say Im so dissapointed!!!!!The idea is dumb,youuse battle cards and all you do is wait to be pulvarized by the impossible bosses and can like never use your special attack. The graphics suck and the battle idea is stupid. I have never wrote a bad DBZ review but this one. I wouldnt spend a dollar on it. Just get taiketsu instead thats much better. If you want a good Ps2 game get budokai2. Trust me I guarentee youll not like this game.	1
I didn't need to rent this game I already knew that this game would be great, because Dragon Ball Z make the best strategy games, like Dragon Ball Z Legend Of the Super Sayian or Super Goku Den. Here are some tips for you in the game: When you face Android 16 and 18 use this move 1st use the 3 stage attack then power up then use the 4 stage attack then you can use a special move (This works on Frieza both times and Cell not Majin Buu)	1
This review was written when the game was first released.  "Metroid Prime" is a game whose release has finally connected the Metroid series to the new age of gaming. The star of the series is Samus Aran, a bounty hunter who, actually, is never seen doing that much bounty hunting. She is more of just an "alien hunter" rather than a bounty hunter, but "bounty hunter" sounds cooler.  So, anyways, Samus the "bounty hunter" is orphaned from an attack by Space Pirates, who aren't really pirates, just a race of "interstellar nomads", as the manual says. So after the space pirates zap Samus' planet, they go and build a huge research complex on the planet Zebes, wiping out most of the native population. They are researching these creatures called "Metroids", which had been recently discovered by the Galactic Federation.  The Space Pirates stayed there for a couple years, researching Metroids, finding new and exciting ways to blow people up, when who should arrive but Samus Aran. She had somehow avoided being blown up along with the rest of her planet's population and had been raised by the Chozo, a bird-like race of creatures. It turns out Zebes had, before the Space Pirates moved in, been a Chozo colony! Whoops! So, the Chozo, being annoyed that a world's worth of their people had been blasted into itty-bitty pieces, they infused Samus with some Chozo blood (giving her super strength, endurance, and speed), gave her a power suit with a gun-arm attached to it, and told her to go smite the Space Pirates until there weren't any space pirates left to smite.  So Samus blasted her way through them, cutting a bloody swath through their operation and even getting the captain, Ridley, and their giant spike-shooting reptile friend, Kraid. Eventually she got to the inner sanctum of the operation, and blasted every Metroid she could find. Finally, she got to the Brain of the Metroids, the Mother Brain, and she blasted that too. So, thinking her job was done, she went to look for the Chozo, who had for some reason gone into hiding.  But the Space Pirates weren't done yet. The survivors immediately split into two groups. Group One returned to Zebes to resuscitate Mother Brain, Kraid, and Ridley. Group Two went off looking for a new planet to make a base on. They found Tallon IV, a planet that had been a Chozo colony until a meteor brought some freaky mutating stuff called "Phazon" that drove most of the Chozo to leave. Before they left, figuring it was the most they could do, the Chozo sealed the meteor off with a temple and split its core, sealing the pieces away. By that time, it was too late for the planet. Plants and animals had been mutated into hideous forms, the ecosystem was completely trashed, and basically the planet was one big nuclear mess. The pirates come across it and decide it's the PERFECT place to live, what with the new experiments they can perform on the little nuclear beasties and such. They leave their ship in orbit so they can send things up and perform "Zero-G experiments" on them. Samus finds them, lands on their frigate, and that's where the game starts up. Undoubtedly, there are a few holes in this story, such as: where did she get her ship? It was not mentioned, but in the game, it says it is, "Registered to Samus Aran." So where did she get it registered? And why is she called a Bounty Hunter? These are just some of the many story-loopholes in this game.  The reason I said that Metroid Prime connected Metroid to the new age is because, unlike the Kirby, Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Donkey Kong series, Metroid did NOT have its own game on the N64. Sure, there was Super Smash Brothers, but that was only a cameo role. There have been only four Metroid games so far: Metroid, for the NES, Metroid II: Return of Samus for the Game Boy, and Super Metroid for the SNES. The last one was made in 1994. Metroid fans have gone 8 YEARS without another Metroid game, and now they get it. And it was worth the wait. Metroid Prime is very well done. In their update to the New Era, many games, mostly side-scrollers like Mario or adventure games like The Legend of Zelda, took the "Third-Person camera" view, with the camera following behind the character. However, ruling that a 3rd Person shooting game (not adventure, it's SHOOTING!) would be kind of annoying, the Metroid Prime design team decided to make it a First-Person shooter. And by golly, it worked.  One of the main differences between this game and other First-Person Shooters is that Metroid Prime has only four types of beam weapons, along with missiles. Most other FPSs have a huge arsenal of weapons, ranging from basic pistols to shotguns to Hi-Tech lasers to guided rocket launchers. Not this game. A basic blaster, an electric wave beam, an ice beam, and a plasma beam are all you get. And even though there are only five types of weapon, this game is anything but boring. Along with the four beam guns, you also get four visors: A basic "Combat Visor", a "Scan Visor", a heat-tracking "Thermal Visor", and an "X-Ray Visor". The Combat Visor is just the normal interface, seeing the world without special goggles. It does, like all the other visors, feature a Heads Up Display, showing health, missiles and a special Danger Level monitor, which goes up when you are near hazards like lava or poison gas.  The Scan Visor, the only visor where you cannot shoot, serves another useful purpose: scanning objects and enemies. When you scan an enemy, the scan reveals the weak spots of the creature, its environment, and its habits. You can also scan hieroglyphs on the wall to read Chozo Lore, you can scan parts of the environment to study plants, you can scan Space Pirate computers to learn about their evil operation, and you can scan power-ups and various stations to learn about them. At some points, scanning nearby objects gives hints on how to get by an area. There are five categories of scan-able items in your database: Creatures, Artifacts, Space Pirate information, Chozo Lore, and Research (powerups). If a scanned object fits into one of these categories, it is put into your database for later research. If you fill up a certain amount of a category, then you are rewarded with Image Galleries, which contains concept art, storyboards, and so on. The Scan Visor gives depth to an otherwise lonely game.  The X-Ray and Thermal Visors both are good for their own reasons, such as seeing invisible objects and enemies, but if you are trying to look at something right in front of you, then certain qualities may make it kind of hard to see. Also, in certain areas, wearing the thermal visor isn't such a good idea (such as in Magmoor Caverns, an underground lava-lake). The graphics in this game are great. From the icy, frozen Sheegoth to the Flaming Magmoor, the creatures of this game are all very well done. Also, the First-Person effects are very well done, too. Go near an electric enemy and your screen becomes static-filled and hard to see through. If Samus is electrocuted or hit for a lot of damage, she puts her hand up to block the blast. Things like these remind you that the character of this game is a person, not just a thing with a gun.  Also, the sound in this game is incredible. The music gives a good sense of place. For example, the music in the Chozo Ruins is mysterious and dark, while the music for the Lava-based Magmoor Caverns is thunderous and includes chanting and such. Certain little tunes, such as the one that plays when you find a major item, will be familiar to players of Super Smash Brothers and Melee (the item tune is what plays as Samus' victory song). The creatures in the game growl, roar, or shriek, depending on what it is. The beam guns all have different sounds. If the electric wave gun kills an enemy, electricity crackles all over the enemy's body, making "zzap-zzap" noises for a couple seconds. The attention to detail is immense.  Samus has always been the first real heroine, but the kind where hero or heroine doesn't matter. You didn't know in the first couple games that Samus was a girl. At the end of one of the later games, Samus takes off her helmet and reveals her gender, as opposed to being a robot. Heck, in most games you wouldn't even know she was human! But in this game, you can tell she is a she. You can hear her voice when she is hit, and (this is a feature that adds a lot of realism), when she dies, she screams and the display flickers and goes out. Also, in parts like elevators, the camera shows Samus from the front, and then zooms in on her face. Yes, her face! Instead of just an opaque green faceplate, the faceplate is now transparent, so you can see her eyes, eyebrows and the outline of her head (kind of). This is a HUGE step forward in realism terms. And about her heroine-ness: She is an armored, tough girl with a gun. Her competitors (for example, Lara Croft) go around dangerous ruins in incredibly skimpy clothing. Heroine advantage: Samus, obviously. Good sense counts for a lot these days.  Overall, this game earns an eight out of ten. Metroid Prime is good, but not perfect. The scariness of some scenes makes it not a good choice for some small children. However, if you are used to that kind of thing, this is a great game.	1
Holy cow... where do I begin? What can I say? If the Retro Studios staff were here, how could I possibly express what is in my heart? The Metroid series and it's awesome hero, Samus Aran, have been a huge part of my life ever since I selected the first of three empty save slots in Metroid Prime nearly 8 years ago. Since then, I have mastered every single game in the series. (Pinball doesn't count.) Not only am I an expert and battle hardened veteran of the games, but also I have created (or tried to create) numerous fanfics, some of which were or are novelizations of the games, and my genius cousin and I have even come up with our own nonexistent fan game. But the question, the question you want to know is, why? How and why do I love it so much? What made me love it so? This is the story of how I discovered the greatest series of all time, and how it appealed to me. I take up my keybo... er, pen to tell you the tale.  It's hard for me to remember a time before Metroid.   My life was different then. I lived in PA. It was a time of great discovery and learning. I had just gotten a GCN the previous Christmas of 2003. I had been reared on such games as the Megaman Legends 2, Mechwarrior 4, and the original Medal of Honor. All of the previous generation.  I didn't even know what Metroid was. When Prime and Fusion came out in the store, I had thought it was some cheesy spin off of Halo or something. I had played the demo of Metroid Prime in stores, (and had thought it cool that you could turn into a ball,) but I couldn't even get past the second force field. Wow... boy, did I suck. (Although I guess Retro was partly to blame for not having the game tell you to switch to the Scan Visor in the demo.) It was, I now realize, a clear indication of how primitive I was then. Of how much I sucked at gaming in general.  Later, I had watched a kid from my church play the game, upon which I found that it was part of a series that featured a female character named Samus Aran in armor, and a creature called a Metroid. But when I watched it, somehow it didn't look like much. I don't know why, but it was as if I was blind to its beauty. Maybe the TV sucked, I don't know. But that would soon change. It all started back in 2004, when I subscribed to Nintendo Power. The first two issues I got featured articles about Metroid Zero Mission, the remake of the NES Metroid. From it I learned little bits about a planet called Zebes (pronounced ZEEBS, NOT ZEBEZ YOU FRIGGIN' IDIOTS) and a race called the Chozo, but I still didn't think much of it. I was just excited to have subscribed to NP. Little did I know that it would ultimately launch me into a realm unlike anything I'd ever seen or experienced.  It started in early September of 2004, with the October issue of Nintendo Power. (NP issues arrive the month before, so technically the October issue is really the September issue, etc.) The cover story was all about Pokemon Firered and Leafgreen for GBA. The cover featured a picture of Charizard of Firered, and Venusaur of Leafgreen. But that's not important. What is important is that above the title, there was the picture of Samus with the words, "Prime 2-exclusive info!" I read the preview. It was unbelievable. It left me craving for more. The more I read that preview the more I thought, "This is freakin' awesome!" As time went on, more info appeared in later issues of Nintendo Power. I became more and more fascinated as a result. I could tell this was a continuation of an epic story that really began in the first game, so I didn't want to get second the second one until I'd played and beaten the first. Besides, NP said that although it wasn't necessary to play the first game, if you did, you'd appreciate it that much more. Another thing that motivated me was the fact that my cousin got Metroid Prime. He described it to me, and it sounded so awesome. However, I was hesitant. Many times before I had saved up my money to get something that turned out to be total crap and I wanted to never make that mistake again. I had 20 bucks saved up, and I did not want them to go down the tubes the way my other money had. So it ended up where I was deciding between Metroid Prime and another game. It was a difficult choice for me, because despite the lure of NP and my cousin's description of the prologue, I really did not know what to expect, and even something that looked this good could so easily be another waste of 20 bucks. The other game, on the other hand, I knew I would enjoy, and would not be a waste of money at all. I cannot begin to describe to you how close I came to getting the other game. But finally, in I think it was November of 2004, (apparently it took me far shorter to beat the game than I'd always thought) I decided to take a blind leap in the dark and buy Prime, even though I knew it might be just another one of the biggest mistakes I'd ever made. As soon as I opened the instruction booklet, I became intrigued. The manual told of an epic storyline involving the Chozo, the Space Pirates, and something called Phazon. It also gave me hints of a wicked arsenal and other cool stuff. But even then I had no idea what was in store. Although the manual looked promising, I still did not know for certain what the game would have in store for me. Even though it seemed a good game, there was a good chance it would be too hard for me. (And it would've been if I wasn't already battle-hardened by Megaman Legends 2, which had a lock-on orbiting system identical to the one in Prime, only in third person, not first-person.) One way or another, 11/??/04 would be a day I would never forget.  I set the disk in the Cube's drive and turned it on. After seeing the title screen and selecting the first of three save slots, I was greeted with the words, "Unidentified distress beacon has been tracked to a derelict space vessel in orbit above Tallon IV."  What happened next, I have tried to describe below, though words cannot do this experience justice.  The skyline of space with the streak of yellow. The Pirate ship in orbit. And the planet of Tallon IV in the background. The music that played when Samus landed her ship in the docking bay. (It would not be until two years later that I would discover it was a remix of music from Super Metroid.) I thrilled when I saw Samus jump fifty feet in the air and do a flip before landing on the ground. Then the camera zoomed in behind Samus's back and suddenly I was behind the visor.  After getting past the force fields, I approached the door to the adjacent hallway. After shooting open the door, I scanned the stuff on the wall and proceeded to the air lock. After repressurizing it, I moved on to the emergency evacuation area. When I entered, metal fell from the ceiling and I stared out at the chaotic scene before me. A large creature was lying on the floor dead (I later identified it as a Parasite Queen) with fires burning all around it. Dead Pirates were all over the floor, their death descriptions exactly as my cousin had described them. After scanning everything in sight, I moved on to the Map Station. After downloading the map, I scanned the computers and took the lift down to deck beta. I then found myself in Biotech Research Area 1. From what I could scan so far, it seemed that two Parasite Queens had broken out of their stasis tanks and gone on a rampage. One was obviously the one that was dead, but what about the other one? I soon found out. After scanning interesting things all throughout the ship and saving at the nearby Save Station, I stepped into the Reactor Core. As I moved forward, a cutscene ensued in which I saw Samus descend the lift platform. A huge creature climbed inside the rector and activated a force field. Now I had to fight the second Parasite Queen. Unfortunately, I forgot to scan it, and it killed me. The second time I did scan it, revealing it's weak spot. Within two minutes, I send the large crustacean packing. Now the reactor was going critical. I had seven minutes to get out of there before the whole thing blew up! After taking a shortcut thru the ventilation shafts, I found Meta Ridley. After seeing him flee like the coward he was, I grappled across the gap and activated the elevator to Deck Alpha. Unfortunately, several pieces of metal slammed me against a wall, and the Varia Suit and all of my upgrades were destroyed!   This came as no surprise to me since the friend who I had watch play the game told me about that part. Unfortunately, I wasn't exactly prepared for it either. After getting the heck out of that ship, (barely) I saw Ridley fly away. I hopped into my ship via cutscene and we descended towards the planet of Tallon IV.  Tracking on enemy target has been lost. Ground-based recon required. Begin landing sequence.  And the rest is history. I've been a proud owner of every game to hit store shelves since, and I even found an ancient rusty, moldy M2ROS cartridge in a store on vacation. Super I have on an emulator, (way better than VC, esp. with cool filters, recorders, cheats, etc.) and the NES Metroid I usually play on Prime, though I do have it on the VC, Zero Mission, and the Classic NES Series GBA cartridge as well. Zero Mission did an awesome job of remaking that game, and I LOVE Other M! It was just the cup of tea true fans had been waiting for. (SamusxAdam FOREVER!!!!!!!!!) Hunters multiplayer was awesome, I'd love to see more of that (Echoes multiplayer sucked with no bots and all), the singleplayer was good but sorely lacking in many quarters. (Killer pistons + chasm deaths + no Mocktroids + getting hurt by your own weapons = EPIC FAIL lol.) It`s just a shame the franchise is dead after the miserably poor sales of Other M, but at least we have AM2R to look forward to. In short, I am and will always be a Metroid fan. What began as a 3-page teaser in a magazine has become an epic saga, a burning passion, and an Empire of Dreams!	1
I've been a fan of Metroid ever since the first NES version. I have picked up every version since. There are loads of reviews for this already so I'll try and keep it short and add my take.  This was the first metroid game to move from the classic side-scrolling to an open world. You still get all the classic gadgets including missile launcher, morph ball, bombs, double-jump, etc. What's typical is that each gadget comes in to play throughout the game. The enemies in this game (and throught the prime triliogy) are space pirates.  What I love about the prime series is trying to find all the upgrades. I like that it doesn't use trophies or achievements yet I wanted to get everything. You have to go back to previously played areas to get to areas you couldn't before without an upgrade.  This game was voted the #1 GameCube game of all time by IGN and for good reason. You will find yourself hooked from the very beginning and the game takes a while to beat, especially if you want to find everything first.  You won't be disappointed if you are fan of Metroid or an open world Mario 64 type game.	1
If you haven't played this game....well just order it now and see why. This is an amazing, perhaps my top five favorite game made. What is it you ask? Well its just a beautiful/spine chilling first person shooter that takes you from the depths of Magmoor Caverons to the frozen Phendrana Drifts. This is like when metroid woke up from the dead because no Metroid game was made on a home system since Super metorid which was also amazing. Then followed by Metroid 2: Return of Samus on GB. And boy has it came back to life for a good reason. The graphics are crystal clear for a GameCube game in 2001. Better than most ps2 shooter games that you would see at the time and future. Anyway, you are samus and you land on tallon IV after an explosion. There you travel around fighting mini bosses, bosses and regular enimies for those of you who haven't played Metroid. This game like all other Metroid games do require allot of mental puzzle minded thinking or else you will get stuck or not know what to do next. It was quite hard for me to beat when i was young. Walkthoughs help allot. The story is very amazing that will keep you hooked on playing for months untill beat and then you will want to beat it again. The atmospheres change from underground volcanic, frozen snowdrifts, rainy nature, to ancient ruins. Each containing several attachments and upgrades for your suit. The further you go, the better stuff you need. Like all other metroid games this one has very soothing and upbeat music that strangly comforts you. The story should take you a good 10-20 hours depending on how you game and every millisecond is worth it. Sadly there is no other mode to do however you can hook up a completed metroid fusion gameboy game to the GameCube and play the original Metroid on the NES and you can even save on it. So if you love adventure/puzzle games, spend the ten bucks and play it. You won't be dissapointed.	1
The Bottom Line Is: This Game Is GREAT!!! Thrilling And Epic Dont Even Begin To Describe It. Samus Travels To A Planet Called Tallon To Defeat The Mean Old Space Pirates And Save The Planet From Phazon. The Music Is The Best Part Of The Whole Game. Its Creepy But Cool At The Same Time! Metroid Is Great Because You Never Know Who..Or What Is Going To Jump Out At You! And Its A Long, Long, Long Game. Endless Hours. And Its Hard Too. And Even Tho You Kill Off The Aliens, Its Never Bloody Or Gross. My Sister Beat This Game A Long Time Ago And I've Just Now Got Around To Playing Myself. Im Hooked. I Will Be Buying The Others As Soon As I Beat This One! However I Warn You: Dont Play This Game By Yourself Or When Your Home Alone! LOL. Im Serious, I Wont Play Without My Sister Sitting By Me! Hehe. This Game Is Not For The Faint Of Heart. So If You Liked The Other Games, You'll Love This One Too. Or If You've Never Played Any Of Them...You've Never Lived And I Feel Sorry For You. So Get This Game! Its A Must Have!!!	1
It's hard to believe that I first played this back in 2003, only for me to revisit it all this time later and still be amazed at how groundbreaking it is.  Bringing Metroid to FPS has to be one of the smartest decisions ever made. I enjoyed the side scrolling adventures provided in Super Metroid, an all time favorite, but seeing how the FPS style was rising, and with Samus' amount of artillery, it just had to work. It works brilliantly. By doing this, you can get the feel of Samus Aran as she treks through multiple landscapes, and with the inclusion of multiple visors, it brings out so much to the adventure. Also, the infamous Morph Ball is here, which will appropriately change the camera to third person view. There are so many interesting features within that it's best to witness them yourself.  The graphics still amaze me to this day as well. They manage to grasp the true feeling of the situation, such as appearances of condensation on the visor or the electrical stunning of a pirate. The soundtrack also drags you in, indicating if there is a certain circumstance to be aware of. It even manages to give its tribute to the classic days of Metroid.  If you missed it during its initial release for the GameCube, it's never too late to experience the power that Metroid Prime still has to offer (especially with the Wii's backwards compatibility*). This was a game ahead of its time, not only bringing back the Metroid franchise but giving it new life to truly remember it buy.  *NOTE: You will also need a GameCube compatible controller and a Memory Card in order to play it for the Wii and to save your data.	1
I'm a grandpa gamer and I remember when FPS's came onto the scene with all the hype. Doom, Quake, Turok etc... I just couldn't get used to the camera view point with any of them. Then along came Metroid. UUGH, another FPS with a stupid gun sticking out.  Then just out of curiosity I bought the darn thing and sure enough, this was the first FPS that I actually played all the way through.  Awesome graphics. Spot on control. Excellent music. Everything is spot on perfect for this kind of game. Yes, I found it difficult and had to resort to the cheat guide many times in order to find all the hidden goodies.  Anything bad? Meh, I still like third person action games more but for a FPS this one and the other two Metroid games are the only ones I can stand to play. Oh, and the final boss is a real pain. Otherwise..... Metroid Prime comes....recommended.	1
Fans of Metroid as a character and a game will like this one. The graphics are nice and the features are good. Recommended.	1
Sorry all but I am about to step on a ton of Nintendo lovers with this brief review about the travesty known as Metroid Prime. If it weren't for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points, I would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a 5 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10 like IGN. Unfortunately, cool graphics, a great map, wonderful environments, super smooth 60FPS and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way through.  Admittedly , this game is from 2002--which would be the infancy of first person shooters on Consoles. This hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the Gamecube controller to make this game livable!! Sure, the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies. The problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemies--like exploding mushrooms, or that rapidly respawning killer grass, or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of. AIming is nearly impossible!! You hold the right trigger and try to move the left stick(the only stick used for control in this game) praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place. YOU see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick!! So you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot at.  All of these things were bearable for the first 5 or 6 hours of the game(I explored every nook and cranny I was loving the game so much) The first few bosses were not too bad and then I got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors. Here is the method. You shoot this boss(for some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss) until he gets kind of winded. You then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirror(Sorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game, you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right?) To destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it. But the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time!! The first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways. Not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time again.  To make matters ever worse, this game uses Save spots. This would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss. NOOOOO. YOu respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a 5 minute platforming section to get back to him. Why do Japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system? Please tell me why??????  Uggh. I think I am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving. So far my experience with the WII has been pretty bad. Should have just stuck with my PS3...	-1
To be completely honest, this is my first time being immersed into the world of Metroid. Even though I played Metroid Prime Hunters ages ago on the Nintendo DS, I can't say I remember too much about it(other than the fact that it was a short game single playerwise and dealt more with multiplayer). This time, however, I've gotten deeply into things and I'm hooked. Now I see why Metroid is revered the world over and I'm curious to find out more.  Metroid Prime takes place three years after the events of Metroid. Samus receives a distress call in her new ship and travels to Tallon IV. Basically to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a powerful radioactive substance known as Phazon. It's here she discovers that the Chozo once settled there but disappered due to a meteor hitting the planet decades before. That's where it all begins. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give too much of it away.  Overall, this game is more about exploring than killing enemies and that's why I like it so much.	1
This game has been out a few years now and most everyone knows whether they like it or not.  Playing through it again, however, it surprised me how well this game holds up.  Should that be a surprise?  Probably not.  Most all Metroid games hold up.  I still have as much fun with Super Metroid as I did when I was 12.  The difference, to me, is that the old 8 and 16 bit games have their charm.  The graphics are what they are and gameplay was what drew you to 'em.  The same is true here.  Though, it must be said that the graphics hold up very well.  This is still a beautiful game.  The environments are breathtaking and realistic.  It definitely looks better than some of the Wii games out there.  The beauty of this game, as is true with the rest of the series, is the sense of immersion and exploration.  The isolation.  The sheer atmosphere of it as you discover new parts of a dying world.  There is a sense of history surrounding you and you must make your way through various puzzles and enemies to find the items that let you continue to explore the world and try to take out the vile Space Pirates using it for their own Phazon-induced schemes.  And you feel like you are there every step of the way.  The bosses are fun, huge and varied.  I enjoyed facing the bosses in this game.  The challenge of figuring out their weaknesses, learning their patterns and taking them down was quite satisfying.  Also, they were neat to look at.  The scan system works, it's very effective in filling in backstory and the history of the planet, as well as figuring out how to deal with enemies.  I don't mind the scan system for those reasons, but I can see how it can be frustrating for some players who feel like all they're doing is scanning objects.  Especially if you are a completist (I'm an "near completist", I don't have to have every single thing, but I will put in effort to get enough to get as close as I can and also not get the lamest ending).  Though I have to throw in that this game does include 2 things I absolutely hate:  1)Water Levels: These are never fun for me.  They are more a chore and I have a deep irrational fear of deep water (even in video games).  It must be noted that this isn't quite as bad once you get the gravity suit.  2)Chozo Ghosts:  No particular reason, I just hate Chozo Ghosts.  They pop up way to often and make backtracking more difficult than it should be (I guess that is a reason after all).  Yes, this game has put a few years behind its release date and there have been a handful of Metroid titles since, but I have a feeling I'll be playing this game more than once or twice in the future.  Just a fun, immersive experience.	1
Will be honest. I started playing this on gamecube, but finally finished it out wii as a part of trilogy. Great game.  PROS. -BLOW JOUR MIND: The environment, the scene and the experience you get through them is just amazing. I still can't believe that they created such effect using gamecube technology. JUST MARVELOUS. -Gadgets: Different beams, missles upgrades, suit upgrades, double jump, powerbomb, combo attack, morphball upgrades, grapple beam. JUST AMAZING. -Story: This is what I like. For those who don't care much about the story, you don't have to read it all. But to those who do, everything will be explained in the FINEST DETAILS. VERY WELL DONE. -Bosses: Again very creative. The final battles are probably THE MOST CREATIVE in the trilogy. -Length: Areas are fairly huge. If you go after majority of items which is highly recommended as final bosses can be tough, it will take you a while to explore them all. -Bonuses: More you explore, more endings you get to uncover. EXTREMELY REWARDING EXPERIENCE.  CONS. - LOTS OF BACKTRACKING: Without a guide, this can be really irritating. Even with a guide, I hated how you have to back track a lot of areas in the ending. - Annoying double jumps: Some upgrades require morphball double jumps. Failure to do so will punish you (harshly at times. -Too many words: Story is really good, but I wish they had more cut scenes.	1
There aren't too many times when I'd call a video game beautiful, but this is one of them. It's like a work of art that you can explore. Even though it's a bit old now, it's still worth playing.	1
My son cannot stop playing this game. After receiving a previous game that would not work on his Game Cube, this one started right up without glitches and he ias finishing his second run at the game.	1
Retro Studios have done a phenomenal job with the Metroid Prime series. Prior to Metroid Prime the only other Metroid game had ever owned was Metroid 2 Return of Samus for the now outdated Gameboy. I actually had my doubts about this game upon picking it up 4 years ago because everyone carries on how hard it is to turn a 2d franchise into 3d but Retro did an exceptional job. As far as gameplay goes its top notch your gonna feel challenged with this one like a lot of Nintendo games they do not hold back either. Graphics for the time when this game came out were exceptional as well and I still find them to be excellent today. Story ? I do not play Metroid for the story as the gameplay carries this one like all Nintendo games. I like how as you go on in the game you get your suit upgraded so you can go to other areas. As well in a few months theres gonna be a Metroid Prime Trilogy on the Wii where they take the Metroid Prime 3 controls and put it on this game and Metroid Prime 2 as well. To sum it up great game and lots of fun and the challenge is included.	1
Absolutely an amazing game, Metroid Prime has to be the not only the best Game Cube game, but undoubtedly the best Metroid game, yes, even exceeding Super Metroid.  No disrespect intended towards Super Metroid; it has its own strengths, but I always thought that it could have been better in various ways.  Metroid Prime is better in some of those ways, and overall I found it to be a much more complete and satisfying game than Super Metroid.  One area in which I will say that Metroid Prime is indisputably superior to Super Metroid is in how it manages the power-ups; you get so much more out of them in Metroid Prime.  Super Metroid it's fair to say did lay the foundation since most of the power-ups in Metroid Prime are the same things seen in Super Metroid, and the few power-ups from Super Metroid that did not make the transition to Metroid Prime often had something similar replacing them that was more suitable for a 3D environment, such as the Boost Ball replacing the Speed Booster.  There are also some new power-ups in Metroid Prime, but regardless of whether they are new or back from Super Metroid, they are all put to better use in Metroid Prime.  Consider that much of Super Metroid, at least until the Wrecked Ship, can be completed almost solely with the wall jump and occasional assistance from the turbo bomb technique.  The High-Jump Boots are not necessary to complete the game, and even most of the grappling beam parts earlier and later in the game can be done using the wall jump.  In fact, whether the wall jump is there or not, the Grappling Beam becomes virtually useless once you find the Space Jump.  Other power-ups like the Spring Ball and X-Ray Scope are interesting, but certainly not necessary.  I tend to get more out of a game that actually requires use of the pick-ups.  In so many platform/adventure games the designers put in tons of things and quite often end up making the game in such a way that requires use of less than half of them.  Rygar the Legendary Adventure for PS2 is a perfect example.  Metroid Prime, with the exception of some of the beam/missile combination attacks, requires use of everything, and the power-ups are not only used, but also used well.  The puzzles and parts of the game which require use of a specific power-up are extremely well done.  Nothing left me thinking anything like "Oh that was a dumb power-up," or "Oh they shouldn't have bothered having that kind of puzzle in the game."  It is to me absolutely indisputable that Metroid Prime does a better job than Super Metroid with the power-ups.  For some specific ways in which the power-ups are put to better use in Metroid Prime, it is worth considering the beams, super missiles and power bombs.  Power Bombs in both Super Metroid and Metroid Prime clear paths, whether by opening doors or clearing away terrain, but in Super Metroid they put in way too many.  Unless you refuse to use the Ice Beam on the metroids in Tourian, there is no way you'll ever even come close to using fifty power bombs, let alone even ten.  Metroid Prime puts in just enough, and unlike in Super Metroid, they can actually help a great deal in certain clutch situations.  As for the beams, I found them much more fun to use than anything in Super Metroid, and combat as a result was much more fun.  For instance, when you finish off a frozen enemy with a missile or another weapon, it makes an awesome shattering noise and ice parts fly everywhere.  Not only are the beams more visually impressive and destructive, but they are also used in new puzzles that are extremely well designed.  The Wave Beam now has a lightning element to it, and certain puzzles require its use to restore power to doors.  The Plasma Beam melts things and is very destructive.  In fact, the beams themselves are so well-rounded for so many situations that I only found myself using regular missiles for little more than finishing off frozen enemies.  The entire system with missiles is different in Metroid Prime than in Super Metroid, I say for the better.  Regular missiles do fire at a much slower rate in Metroid Prime than in Super Metroid, but I find this to be a non-issue since the game seemed designed to minimize their use.  I only found myself using regular missiles sparsely throughout most of the game, and once the Plasma Beam came, missiles were very forgettable; the Plasma Beam destroyed just about everything, even some fire-based enemies.  Does this mean that missiles are useless in Metroid Prime?  Absolutely not.  Metroid Prime does different things with the missiles.  Unlike having the Super Missiles as separate pick-ups from regular missiles, the Super Missile in Metroid Prime is an individual pick-up that functions similarly to the Charge Beam.  It's activated by hitting the missile button after charging the Power Beam instead of releasing A, but it still costs five missiles.  The concept is that the Super Missile itself never runs out as long as you don't run out of regular missiles.  I found this to be a very good idea, and the visual upgrade and devastation from the regular missile to super missile are both much more imposing in Metroid Prime than in Super Metroid.  Charging other beams and using them with missiles produces some devastating attacks that help greatly late in the game, and they really left me thinking that aside from the completion percentage, it was these amazing attacks for which it was worth picking up all the missile expansions.  Anytime a game makes it worth finding the power-ups, it deserves praise.  I believe that another thing that should be taken into account in a Metroid game is the quality of the surroundings and environments.  I found both Super Metroid and Metroid Prime to have a decent variety of environments, but for a variety of reasons I found it much more fun to roam around in Metroid Prime than in Super Metroid.  As mentioned I found combat more fun in Metroid Prime, but other things to take into account are the visors.  In Super Metroid movement is impossible with the X-Ray Scope, but in Metroid Prime, not only is movement possible with the different visors, but also mandatory since certain enemies can only be seen and fought with them.  The Thermal and X-Ray Visors can be visually mesmerizing, and the Scan Visor is one of the best ideas ever made for taking a series from 2D to 3D.  It makes paying more attention to the surroundings well worth it and helps shed much insight on the story.  It should also be noted that Metroid Prime rewards the player for finding items and getting all the scans.  Look back at Super Metroid; does the game give any reward for collecting 100% of the items?  No.  In Super Metroid the best ending comes from beating it in less than three hours, regardless of how sloppily it may have been played.  Metroid Prime awards better endings and opens art galleries for more objects picked up and scanned, and in doing so it creates much more motivation and satisfaction for picking up everything than Super Metroid does.  Looking for power-ups in Metroid Prime is also much more manageable without help since they make a noise when you get close to them.  By no means does this guarantee that you'll find 100% without any problems; you will still have to be thorough, scan things, and use your brain since not all of them are immediately accessible.  Some are in isolated little areas and you won't hear them if you have to bomb something, go through a tunnel, or do something else to get within hearing range.  In Super Metroid the power-ups are much more obscure, and if you don't already know where they all are, you're not nearly as likely to find them.  Using the X-Ray Scope to go over every inch of the game certainly wouldn't be much fun either.  In Metroid Prime if you really try hard to find things, scan everything, keep the TV at a loud enough volume, and generally just play thoroughly, you should find close to at least 90-95% of the pick-ups without help.  Rewards based on how well the game is played I find much more fitting for a Metroid game than rewards based on how fast the game is played.  I think that Super Metroid has only a few things over Metroid Prime.  One of them would have to be its creepy beginning.  The creepy atmosphere on Ceres Station and on Zebes in the very beginning is really amazing.  The beginnings of Metroid Prime 1 and even Metroid Prime 2 are somewhat creepy, but I found Super Metroid to surpass them.  The lack of enemies and mysterious music created the mood perfectly.  Another area where I can see some people having a problem with Metroid Prime is that it does not really have much of a final area.  The Impact Crater is little more than a few rooms, and there is no evacuation at the end of the game.  These things are very true, but I think Metroid Prime makes up with a final boss that's actually somewhat challenging.  Mother Brain is a joke in Super Metroid.  All it takes to win is to just stand there and shoot, and annoyingly wait for all your life to be drained out.  The final boss in Metroid Prime, which ironically is also called Metroid Prime, can actually be challenging and takes some time to kill.  It can't be put into words how good Metroid Prime is.  Compared to Super Metroid or on its own, Metroid Prime is about as close to perfect as a game will ever get.  The only valid complaint worth making against it is that a few of the scans are unreasonably easy to miss.  Some enemies only appear once and in their brief appearances disappear very quickly; therefore you won't be able to get their scans unless you hit reset or start a new game.  I certainly understand the one-chance with bosses since the only way to miss scanning a boss is by just forgetting, but little enemies such as some bats that appear for maybe five seconds and are never seen again?  That's just not fair, but one negative against an infinitude of positives certainly makes the positives dominate.  For anyone who owns a Game Cube or Wii and is more than a casual game fan, Metroid Prime is a must.  Anyone expecting a typical first-person shooter from it obviously knows very little about video games.  Metroid Prime is a Metroid game all the way, and the best one at it by far.	1
I purchased a Gamecube just to play Metroid Prime.  If I had never played any other game, it still would have been well worth it.  Great graphics, crisp controls.  Excellent level design and atmosphere.  Fantastic sound and music, with some re-worked themes from classic Metroid titles.  Good replay value due to higher difficulty settings and the challange of finding all possible items/upgrades.  Although the control scheme classifies this as a First Person Shooter, this game is primarily about exploration and puzzle-solving, with a healthy does of combat to keep you on your toes.  In my opinion, a must-own for Gamecube fans.	1
I could play this game over and over. The evrironments in this game are breath taking. The weapons and boss battles are fun as ever. This game will be around for a long time.	1
I'll be honest, I absolutely hate 1st-person shooters for console systems, but Nintendo really got it right with this one.  There were no Metroid games for the N64, so the bar for this game was set by Super Metroid--one of the best games Nintendo has ever released.  On top of that, this was the first attempt at a 3D version of a Metroid game.  Naturally, I was worried that it would disappoint.  It doesn't.  The controls are brilliant.  By the time you get started, it'll take you all of 15 minutes to master the controls, which gives you the rest of the time to marvel at the stunning graphics, seductive soundtrack, and brilliant level design.  Words can't adequately describe the look and feel of this game.  Turn off the lights, get comfortable, turn the game on, and you'll get sucked right in.  The game designers have successfully created a world that you will feel totally immersed in.  Just don't forget to eat food and take bathroom breaks.  Stop reading this review and buy it already.  You won't be disappointed.	1
I hate this game, it has 2 more parts and the story doesn't make sense, it's super hard! and makes you epileptic, because you don't know what to do!!	-1
Besides RE4, this is still one of the best GC games around!!! The graphics and environments are awsome. This is coming from a PC gamer that has been playing First Person Shooters since the original Wolfenstien. Every Game Cube owner must add this game to the collection. Beats most current games, hands down!! Plus, it'll keep you busy for along time.	1
Metroid Prime is definitely overrated.  Let me list all the reasons why-  - The game totally rips off Mega Man Legends 2, a Playstation game released two years before this game came out on the Gamecube.  The fire snakes that pop out of the lava, and the beetles that pop out of the ground, are two things in particular that are WAY too similar to aspects of MML2 for me to buy this is supposed to be some kind of coincidence.  - The music is severely disappointing.  The main theme song where the spaceship is located in the beginning of the game is a remake of the classic theme from the original Metroid (released in 1986) but done much, much worse.  Oh sure, it may have sounded beautiful and epic back in 2002 to signal the realistic approach to the 3D movement video games were taking at the time, but nowadays, this particular theme lacks inspiration, melody, and any distinctive qualities.  In other words, despite the epic beauty of the music, it's just bland and pointless to me.  I'll take the original 1986 version with its inspirational melody thank you very much.  - I mention this game feels like a ripoff of Mega Man Legends 2.  It's also a ripoff of Quake II, the classic PC shooter.  The environments and many of the dark areas feel *exactly* like Quake II, which makes me wonder why I'm playing Metroid Prime when I COULD be playing Quake II instead.  Metroid Prime is nothing more than a corridor shooter.  - The enemies you encounter are quite uninspiring for the most part.  You have these suicidal bats that dart down from the ceiling, but they're small, boring and lack inventiveness.  You have vines that pop out of walls and pretend like they're snakes- these are just annoying to shoot.  You have wasps that swarm from hives and dive at you- it is VERY irritating to take out a swarm of these.  There was nothing like this in Super Metroid.  Nothing was irritating about the enemies in that game.  Enemies are not only annoying to take out completely, but unacceptable to look at because of the way bland way they were designed.  - Boss battles are flat-out horrible.  That gigantic plant you have to take out is underwhelming compared to the plant boss in Super Metroid (not to mention it takes WAY too much time to actually defeat, despite your best efforts to use the charge beam and morph ball).  I'm not impressed at all here- boss battles are, for the most part, overlong and boring with no usage of creativity on the part of the developers.  - Metroid Prime overall suffers from the same problem that Resident Evil 4 suffers from- the movie-like cinematic feel of the entire game, used for no other reason than a cheap attempt to make the game look as much like a movie as possible.  I don't see the appeal of these kind of games to be totally honest- going for that grand and pretentious movie theater effect in video games has been done so many times by this point that it's just not worth the time or energy to create them this way anymore, not to mention graphics aren't nearly as important as many gamers would have you believe- graphics mean crap to me.  - The game is trying to go for a perfect 3D update to Super Metroid, but Metroid Prime is *nothing* like Super Metroid.  How CAN it be???  Metroid Prime is just one of literally hundreds of generic 3D shooters out there where one man (or in this case, woman) goes through a huge world, narrow corridors, and shooting and exploring... and before you say this game is all about exploration... let me respond by saying "Not really".  The exploration aspect has been greatly exaggerated because you're honestly not exploring more in this game than you are in, say, Quake II and THAT game never gets credit for the exploratory features it implements, so neither should this one.  I just don't like this game very much.  It's boring, overrated, and not very fun.  This game gets a 2 out of 5, despite the fact amazon keeps saying I'm giving it a 5 out of 5.  Trust me, I'm not.	1
I bought Metroid Prime about 5 months ago, and have beaten it 3 times so far. I've gotta tell you, this game is so great, that playing it three times just isn't enough. On my list of the twenty greatest games ever, Metroid Prime is # 2. That is saying alot, considering that the list also includes Splinter Cell, Goldeneye for the n64, and Halo 2's multiplayer.  In this review, I will give you a brief history of the Metroid series leading up to the game this review is actually about, Metroid Prime. The reason I am including this short history is so that people who have never played a Metroid game before will be somewhat familiar with the series.  But now let's get down to the basics.  The first Metroid game in the series was released in 1986 for the NES, and established the Metroid series. Basically, the game showed you that in the future, there is a bounty hunter named Samus Aran, and he must destroy a new species of alien called, you guessed it- Metroids! These creatures are being used by the wicked space pirates as biological weapons. So Samus flies to the planet Zebes to end the space pirate menace and the Metroid threat once and for all. He, in the end, fulfills his mission, destroying the space pirate leaders Mother Brain, Ridley and Kraid, and ends the Metroid threat once and for all! - Or so he thinks .... But the end of the game revealed a suprise... Samus is a girl!  The second Metroid game in the series was Metroid 2, released in 1991 on the Gameboy. The game continued the story, revealing that Samus had not actually completely destroyed the Metroids.  So she went to SR388, the home planet of the metroids, and defeated the space pirates and the Queen Metroid. However, before leaving the planet, Samus discovered a baby metroid, and took it back to the Federation for research....  The third game in the Metroid series was Super Metroid, released in 1994 for the NES. The space pirates are recovering from Samus' attack, and Ridley has stolen the baby metroid. Samus heads back to Zebes and destroys Mother Brain again, and barely escapes the planet bfore the space pirates' self destruct program destroys the planet.  The fourth game in the Metroid series is Metroid Zero Mission, released in 2001 for the Gameboy Advance. This game is actually an extended look at Samus' first trib to Zebes, and in it, Samus once again defeats the space pirates.  And now we come to Metroid Prime, the fifth game in the Metroid series, released in 2002 for the Gamecube.  Metroid Prime is the first game in the series that is 3D. It is also a first person shooter, another first for the series. The game's story line goes like this: Samus detects a distress call from a space station in orbit above the planet Tallon IV. She goes to it to investigate, only to find that the space station is a space pirate station.  She infiltrates the station, only to find that the Space Pirates are almost all dead, due to several experiments that have gone horribly wrong. She ventures on, eventually finding one of these experiments. She destroys it, which sets off the space pirates' self destruct system. She runs for her life, but another suprise is in store. Ridley is also trying to escape the station, and he flies away, trying to escape the station before it explodes. Basically, Samus chases Ridley to Tallon IV's surface, where the rest of the game takes place.  I won't reveal any more details, as this is only a review, not a walkthrough or a spoiler. I will let you know that what I just told you is actually less than a twentieth of the game's length.  This game is extremely long, so if you enjoy playing games for a while to beat them like I do, this game will fit you like a glove. However, the game is definately not for casual gamers, because the game usually takes between 15 - 24 hours of solid gameplay just to beat it, and even longer to find all of the secret hidden items that are all over the place on Tallon IV. This is not saying that Metroid Prime is boringly long, as the complete opposite is true. Metroid Prime's length is caused by the exploration in the game.  That brings me to another factor. This is not just a shooter where you run from room to room killing everything in your path. Metroid Prime is as much a strategy game and an exploration game as a first person shooter. In fact, you will probably spend as much time exploring and searching for weapons and items as you will battling swarms of enemies.  The alien enemies you fight in the game range from huge War Wasps to Space Pirates to a Gigantic rock monster. This also brings up a factor of the game: its graphics. Every detail is perfect no matter how close to a landscape or enemy you get. The graphics make you feel like you are a part of the action, as Space Pirates drop from the ceiling to fight you, or you explore a flooded cave.  The locations you play in are stunning, as they look real. As you play through the game, you will explore a lush jungle, a barren and desolate desert, a frozen white and snowy land full of caves and mountains, a Space Pirate mine, an ancient temple, and firey caverns filled with lava and fire snakes.  The game is brimming with boss battles as well. There are over a dozen bosses you must defeat in order to beat the game. Each and every battle is unique, and you will have to use your brain to beat some of them.  Metroid Prime is difficult, but most of the difficulty is due to challenging puzzles and frustrating bosses. If you stick to it, you can beat it in around a week and a half of consistent playing.  The gameplay is unique as well, as there are things that you can do in this game that you can't do in most other games. For example, you can roll up into a ball to navigate tight spots, and to explore every nook and cranny of the game.  The music in Metroid Prime is great as well, as it compliments the gameplay in every aspect. The music gets more frantic as you battle enemies or a boss, and then it is peaceful again after they are defeated.  As I said above, this game is one of my favorite games ever. In fact, that is the only reason I am writing this review. I gave this game 5/5 stars, but I would definitely have given it more if I could.  All in all, Metroid Prime excels in gameplay, graphics and music.  There is a good reason why it is a player's choice game, and I hope this review has helped you out in your decision.  Thanks for reading! -Bubba"Samus"	1
I got Metroid Prime several years back for Christmas.  If I may be so blunt, the first level was a turn-off to me.  I died over and over again, and sadly, I put the game away on my shelf...  Until several months later, when I whipped it back out and decided it was time to take my strategy to the next level and try and master this game.  I made it past the first world, and became engrossed in the game's story and style of gameplay.  The thing that people must understand about this game is that it is challenging beyond imagination.  You'll find yourself tearing out your hair at some points, and at other times you'll be fleeing from giant ice beasts that punish you for infiltrating their nest.  This game's action has no limits.  The first level was so hard to me because I was never used to this type of difficulty in a game; first levels of video games tend to be easy as pie, right?  That doesn't happen with Metroid Prime.  The game always challenges the player to no end, forcing you to bring out your true amount of skill.  That is one of the factors that makes this game an excellent one.  Metroid Prime is a game that acts as a radar; it really shows you how good you are at games.  It is not one of those games where you aimlessly and carelessly shoot at enemies to win.  Heck no...Metroid Prime is a game based on enemy patterns, timing, and realizing where the foe's weak points are.  This game reveals to you your level of skill, like a long and hard test of bravery.  And it took me a long time to complete this test.  The final boss is one of my favorite in video game history; it took me about eight tries to beat it.  And the feeling after I won was one word: exhilarating.  This was the first Metroid game I ever played.  It's also the most difficult one I've ever played, aside from the original Metroid.  But now I'll get into detail about what makes the game excellent.  I've pretty much covered difficulty.  Now the story: Samus Aran has received a distress call from a Space Pirate Frigate; it seems that some specimens have broken loose.  And that's all I'm going to say; if you want to hear more in terms of plot, play the game or read the manual.  Graphics: amazing.  Every boss is extremely detailed.  The environments look very natural.  You can see mountains, jungles, snow-covered lands, etc.  It's like you're in a virtual game.  Sound effects: Blew me away completely.  There is a particular boss I remember that uses a shockwave-type attack with the most distinct sound: it sounds as if static electricity is spreading over a metal surface.  Music: in the main world, there is peaceful music.  In boss fights, there is a unique track per boss.  Boss music tends to elevate a sense of excitement in the player while playing; imagine fighting a tough boss with fast-paced music.  It really raises the adrenaline.  Gameplay: the game is extremely long, with many puzzles and dozens of different creatures to encounter.  I love exploring the vast environments in Metroid Prime.  Seeing lava serpents (called "Magmoors") pop out all of a sudden is so cool.  There are upgrades to collect, enemy data files to add to your log book, and strange artifacts to collect that show the path to the final stage.  My conclusion: one of my favorite games of all time, even better than the Halo series, in my opinion.  It takes a serious amount of commitment to face the final boss and win.  It takes a lot of commitment to even get to that point.  But for beginners, let me tell you this: the first level seems tough and long, but once you complete that part, you will be thrown into an amazing world full of boss fights that make you shout with happiness once you kill them.  And who knows...you might unlock something really freaking cool when you beat the game. *HINT HINT*	1
I had this game since about it's launch date or so, and when I got it, I was fairly excited. However, I was mainly displeased at how the game was played. It's a very open-ended game so you will find yourself going through a spot on a level, destroying, searching, finding, and back tracking quite a bit. Here is my review for Metriod Prime for the Nintendo Gamecube.  Graphics: 10/10. Definitely the best standout for the game. Unbelievable graphics show how powerful the little Nintendo Gamecube really is. It's quite easy to compare these graphics to a Graphical King like Halo. Hell, when you walk over some things in this game your mask will get foggy. That is pretty cool. The enviroments look great and so do the critters. Samus' suit is very shiny too. :]  Sound: 9/10. Very well done sound. The music is great, the different baddies you shoot at make unique sounds, the bosses do as well, the water sounds good, everything sounds good. It really adds to the experience with the game.  Control: 9/10. The control for many may be extremely frustrating and confusing, but really it's not all that bad. There are quite a few different controls but it's nothing to get bent out of shape about and get so depressed you want to hang yourself in the bathroom, no, but they are somewhat hard to get used to, I guess. But after you play for about a half an hour you will get the feeling.  Fun: 7/10. This is where the game just sinks for me. The game is great in everything else except the fun. It's fun until you get to a hard part and you have absolutely no idea what to do so you need to backtrack and whatnot just to pass a little part of a level. Another flaw is no multiplayer; which definitely should have been added in this game because it could have been a great party game; even if there would be no online play. So basically, this is a single player game that is about 50% exploration, 20% boredom, and 30% action. This game I found to be very hard, so if you want to succeed in Metroid Prime, you had better get a strategy guide. Good luck.  7.9/10	1
Growing up to the Metroid series, I had it in my head that the game should be a 2D side scrolling adventure.  When I saw that they put this out as a 3D first person shooter, I was very disappointed.  While I don't mind the FPS format, I really didn't expect this to translate as well as it did.  In the previous Metroid games, you had to explore every nook and cranny to make sure you had all the power-ups, while most of the FPS games I've played were focused on shooting things.  Well, I'm very happy to say that the game designers kept the Metroid feel even though they changed the entire engine it's based on.  Quite frankly, I think this was one of the smoothest FPS games I've ever played.  The controls are very natural, and they have a nice feature of "locking" onto a target.  The gameplay is very much "free roaming" meaning you can pretty much go wherever your current power-ups will allow you to go.  As far as the graphics and sound go, well they're superb.  This game really shows what the GameCube has to offer from a technological standpoint.  The sound is pumped out in Suround Sound (which I really enjoy) and the graphics are so beautiful.  The scenery is breath taking, and the animations are outstanding.  Oh, and one of my personal favorite features of this game:  The scan visor!  For those who relish little details in video games, this is right up your ally.  You can scan enemies and objects in the environment alike.  This helps you through the game, as well as enhances the story.  At any rate, to avoid making this too long, buy this game!  It's awesome!	1
Such an excellent game.  And so much richer than any FPS I've ever played.  Now don't get me wrong, I love the classic FPS's like Goldeneye and Perfect Dark, and at first I was a little bummed that Prime was going to be a FPS, but the game turned out to be brilliant.  Don't listen to the negative reviews: it's either from people who weren't up to the challenge of the game, or were simply looking for a mindless shoot 'em up game.  Prime actually requires some brainpower.  A couple important points here:  Some complain about the excessive scanning of everything around you, but really this is what makes the game so excellent.  It is through your scanning of creatures, data files, computers, etc. that you unfold the story of the game.  If you completely ignore all the scanning, not only will the game be harder, but you'll miss out on a really interesting plot line.  Graphics and music are beautiful.  Not to be missed.  Controls are relatively easy once you get the hang of it.  It makes battle less frustrating than other games, but by no means easy.  Speaking of difficulty, the normal mode is fairly challenging, and should satisfy most people.  The hard mode (available only after you beat normal) is VERY tough.  Have fun with it.  If there's a downside to this game, it may be that the world is too vast, with too many areas to explore and many  upgrades to find.  I found the players' guide invaluable, but the game is certainly doable without it.  Just expect to do a lot of backtracking and experimentation.  Overall a superb game.  Give it a shot.	1
Metriod Prime - Circa 2003  GOOD:  - Beautifully detailed world and environments  - Unique gameplay style  BAD:  - Exploring in first person is not for everyone  - Gameplay is not a traditional first Person Shooter, which may turn off some  IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:  - A Sci-Fi / Exploratory first person shooter  GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:  - Metriod Prime: Echoes  - Halo  - Super Metriod  ADDITIONAL NOTES:  - Believe it or not this games story takes place after the original Metroid but before Metriod II: The Return of Samus (from the Game Boy)  - Using the Game Boy Advance link cable you can "link-up" this game and the Game Boy Advance game Metriod Fusion, Note if you beat Metriod Prime you can unlock an art gallery in Metriod Fusion, if you beat Metriod Fusion you can unlock the original Metroid (from NES) in Metriod Prime  - Scanning thing in the game not only gives you background information but helps unlock an art gallery in the game	1
Metroid Prime came out in late 2002 and shocked all compitition with its amazing graphics, emensis monsters, in a FPS with mostly a hunt and retreve mode.  The game of the year for 2002 was taken place in an uncharted world named Tallon 4. Samus came to destroy half of the remaning Space Pirates from the original 2D game Metroid, she loses most of her abilities in an crash in a pirate frigate early in the game, she must collect all of her missing arsanal of weapon, suit, and visior ,over the course of the game, from the far corners of Tallon 4's climate(Tallon overworld, Phazon mines, Magoorn caverns, Chozo ruins, and Phindendra drifts), hunt the space pirates ,as well as their leader Ridly, and recover the sacred Chozo artifactes to get in the Phazon crater to see what made the Chozo bird-like people to go away and turned the animals into monsters.	1
The series of Samus would be the best shooter series in the world.  The lowest official review I found for this game was 9.7 out of 10, and that was the best game on the website.  You start out as Samus from the classic Metroid series, only put into the spacesuit that would be the legend herself, on the Space Pirate Frigate.  The controls are a killer to learn, but a half-an-hour worth's of gaming would be more than substantial time for an average gamer to master.  I learned in around 10 minutes, and I'm surprised, as I am not the best gamer, but I am one of the best.  This game is nearly impossible to beat without the Official Guide from Prima, because there is around 49 missile expansions, 5 powerbomb expansions, 4 beam weapons to acquire and master, and much more.  Now to actual gaming.  I must start out with all of the flaws.  This game lacks an extremely useful multiplayer co-op mode, or any type of multiplayer mode in general.  The Samus could have just cloned herself and had the top scientists make her buddies more power suits.  That kind of strays into Metroid Prime 2, but not completely.  I hope Metroid Prime 3 falls into a co-op multiplayer mode somehow.  Now for the good sides of the game.  I start by comparing to Halo.  Metroid Prime is often called the sister to Halo, but if Samus adopted the destructiveness of Halo, it would kill.  The graphics in Metroid greatly makes Halo seem like the Microsoft francise would be in a 64-bit game.  Halo attempts to maintain a solid 25 frames per second, but they fail miserably, sometimes freezing for half-a-second, which would probably kill you.  Metroid Prime, however, maintains a solid 60 frames per second without failure, and that is a big step.  The graphics between Metroid and Halo are actually very similar, both with highly detailed worlds.  I can't express the pain the creaters must have gone through to make such a good game.  Your enemies are painstakingly created, and the worlds that surround them are even more spetacular.  The gameplay is excellent, with around 60 hours without the guide, and 10 with the guide.  Here is a final  Graphics: 10 They are the best part of the game.  Gameplay: 9.5 Confusing without the guide.  Soundtrack: 10 Suspenseful and everchanging.  Best Bang for your Buck: Yes.  User Rating, 9.85  This is an add-on.  Metroid Prime-GCN  Few games have been up to the challenge that has been faced with the newest game in the arsenal of the Nintendo Gamecube.  Metroid Prime, however, is one of these few games.  Anticipated to be a horrible game in comparison to the two dimensional Metroid Series, Metroid Prime has taken the leap from 2-D to 3-D with unsurpassed greatness and dedication.  Retro Studios, based in Houston, Texas, an industry of only 50 members, have earned a reputation that rivals only the greatest in the making, crushing giants such as Capcom and Namco in terms of deliverance, and beating the Microsoft leader of the legendary game of Halo, Bungie.  With the pressure that was put on them by legions of Nintendo fans, Retro would have expected to collapse under the pressure, but did they?  Read on to find out.  Game play- The most immense worlds are useless without good game play to support them, but Metroid Prime has both, with stunning visuals to support them.  Become the bounty hunter behind the visor once more, and this time, really become the bounty hunter behind the visor, as you are really Samus Aran, and you see what she sees.  On a space vessel doomed from the beginning, the creations of a story that would lead in history were in the making, as Samus Aran flew her ship through asteroids and meteors to get to the Space Station.  As she lands, you can get a very useful introduction that teaches everything you need to know with the greatest ease and simplicity.  When the timing is right, and you are getting used to the controls of the greatest first-person adventure in the making, you are getting ready to fight a monster, and mutated bug.  While this bug may be 50 times your size, it's only half of your strength, and you really hone you skills on the monster from the biology labs.  But the monster begins a self-destruct sequence and a trip to Hell and back begins!  You land on a planet named Tallon IV, with a lush over world that makes scenery in Halo look like Paper Mario.  As you explore to find out where you're next objective is, you may come across the Space Vessel that crashed in its attempt to mutate a bug.  You can see it is still smoking, and after you return to it after the first time, it will not be smoking, adding realism.  You start out with a power beam and a power suit.  As you look around, you will find hidden extras and power-ups that can be used in later battles against harder enemies.  Don't expect a story where everything is given to you.  You have to earn it, and how, but looking.  For Example, it could be like finding a nickel or a quarter in the sandbox when you were 5 or 6; somebody would tell you it was there, they just wouldn't find it for you.  The ability to think for yourself is something you won't find in smash hits such as Halo or Timesplitters 2.  Metroid Prime requires you to scan for weaknesses in your enemies and for you to figure out how to destroy them yourselves.  One way to obtain this ability is to use different visors.  Metroid Prime has multiple "visors" that are heat, light, and x-ray sensitive, along with a scan visor that gathers information about an opponent.  The boss at the end, Metroid Prime requires use of all four of these visors, an annoying but more refreshing use of equipment than standard light sensitive equipment.   Exploration.  It made The United States of America what it is today, and it makes Metroid Prime just as great.  For example, you can find 2 more visors, 3 more beam weapons, a morph ball (which is expected to be in Halo 3) and bombs for the morphball, spiderball, boost ball, beam powerups, and 250 missiles.  But these are not given to you.  For the larger powerups, you need to fight a boss that would rip a normal human to shreds, and you need to look for them, literally.  They are hidden throughout the world.  To give you an idea of how long it would take to collect them, and professional gamer did not complete it in under 60 hours without a guide.  While it is not overly impossible, Metroid requires skill, and more importantly, determination that cannot be stopped after losing to a boss.  It requires multiple attempts, and if you cannot succeed, you just aren't trying hard enough, because this games was designed for you to succeed with a fight.  Graphics-  With all of this mumbo-jumbo about Cube-mapping, I guess it would be safe to say that Metroid Prime has exceeded what Cube-Mapping would be.  The visuals are simply stunning.  From the snowy regions of Phendrana Drifts to the Fiery Growl of Magmoor Caverns, Metroid Prime's levels are taken from life, or so it would seem.  Gamespot.com states this perfectly- "In fact, the game has no levels. It's all one vast, continuous world that somehow manages to blend numerous, starkly different environments, from lush tropics to dusty caverns to frigid fields of ice to hellish lakes of fire. Metroid Prime has no loading times whatsoever, not when you first turn on your GameCube, and not when you run through miles of Tallon IV's incredibly detailed vistas. Using a classic convention of the Metroid series--areas of Tallon IV are walled off by iris-shaped doors that must be shot open using your beam weapons--the game manages to quietly, invisibly stream new content in the background as you move along. This is similar to a technical feat first seen in Crystal Dynamics' imaginative Soul Reaver games, only Metroid Prime's environments are even more detailed and the background loading is even more transparent than in those games.  "The benefits to there being no loading times in the game cannot be overstated. One way to put it is, after playing Metroid Prime, you may find that most level-based games seem somehow primitive to you. At any rate, the sheer size, the remarkable detail, and the continuous nature of Metroid Prime's setting are huge parts of what makes the game so fantastic. You'll see tremendous variety in the scenery, from tight, claustrophobic corridors to flooded passageways to vast, elaborate temples, and it all looks natural and lifelike and yet isn't confusing or bewildering. When you can jump to reach a certain area, you'll know. When something is out of your reach, you'll know why. How the designers were able to make environments that have a natural feel and yet are easy to explore without seeming contrived is an utter mystery. One thing's for certain: The designers at Retro Studios are extremely talented."  The soundtrack is stunning, with compositions from Kenji Yamamoto.  You expect something that you would hear from a place with Magma covering the walls, or the peaceful tranquility that snow would offer.  There is no way to describe the level of skill that the soundtrack delievers.  If you don't believe me, then you must try it for yourself.  My Rating- 9997/10000  I wrote it myself.  No plaguarism found.	1
Metroid Prime is a 3-D Metroid title developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo.  In the beginning, Metroid Prime is a great game.  The graphics are unbelievable and the game play is interesting.  Once you start, it's hard to walk away from the game.  Even bathroom trips become a major nuisance.  When you reach the middle, the game play is still fun to an extent, but by this point you've gotten annoyed with the enemies once or twice.  They regenerate every time you walk out of a room.  Nothing changes.  Finally, you reach the end and you've gotten all of the upgrades, you've beaten the bosses, and the scenery has all become familiar.  After playing the game once through, you'll probably have little interest in repeating the game.  So while it is great the first time around, it does become repetitive.	1
Metroid fans will definitley get a kick out of this, but other people, might not. The thing in Prime is that it's a FPS, but they don't use both of the analog sticks! Hello?! FPS?! To aim up, I'll just hold the "R" Trigger and move it. And You can't change that! Although the graphics are nice, it's very easy to get lost in the forest like areas. The game is fun, but sometimes the fun will be killed because of the controls.	1
...ok so heres the idea of the game....take an action genre such as first person shooter..thats typicaly fulled of action and fun...and instead make it incredibly boring...but give the consumer lots of needless information like "this plant is the jugahuga plant"..I DONT CARE!!  this game bores meeee the boss fight where u were runnign around it was pretty fun but thats the only action in the game...the world was beautiful and everythign was beautiful...but i didn't 'click' with this world... it just felt like i was looking at a pretty moving picture....kind of the equivalent of watching somebody else playing.......then again i like watching my friends play games..but..just not this one...	-1
As a FPS-phobiac, I don't know why I picked up this game. I'm glad I did, though. With this game, Nintendo has tackled yet another genre with aplomb, adding FPS to a list that already includes platformers (Mario), action/adventures (Zelda), and RPGs (Pokemon and Paper Mario).  I loved the approach to first-person combat. The controls are smooth as silk, and make it easy to move and shoot at the same time. Weapon and visor switching can be done at the press of a button. Overall, I found the game's controls very easy to master. The game itself, however, was another matter.  The level of difficulty here fried my nerves to no end. I would walk carefully through an area, my heart beating frantically as I wondered when the next group of space pirates was going to leap down and ruthlessly attack me. There are almost no "grunt"-type enemies in the game. Each and every one proves a genuine threat. And don't even get me started on the bosses--not only do they make you know fear with their rabid behavior, but they'll decimate you within seconds if you're screwing around. You'll cry with relief every time you reach a checkpoint and can save your progress. I would reccomend buying a strategy guide so you can figure out where to go and where the power-ups are, but even when you know what to do, it doesn't make doing it any easier. Without a doubt, this is the most intense, nerve-racking, scary, and difficult game I have ever played. And then you can play Hard mode, if you enjoy pain.  So with all that, why do I still adore this game? Well, whenever I would actually get to a save point/beat a boss/get a power-up/etc., I would feel like the bomb. Even though I used a strategy guide, I still felt like an uber-gamer every time I accomplished something.  You've heard me mention power-ups several times now. Well, there's a reason for that: they rock. Torching fools with my Heat Ray is one of the funnest things I've ever done. The Super Missles aren't too shabby either, especially when I shattered that Omega Pirate's knees. The different visors (such as Thermal, X-Ray, etc.) all have neat views. And they're not only cool, they each have puzzle-solving capabilities, so they're useful too. And once you have all the essentials, you can collect the dozens of energy and missle expansions. They're all fun to get, and absoloutely necessary to beating the final boss.  As I used all my cool powers, screamed in terror at bosses and regular enemies alike, racked my brain for strategies, navigated the environments (which also rock--they have all kinds of clever nooks and crannies to explore, and the graphics are amazing), whooped with joy when I beat a boss, and investigated the depths of the game's story (there are no cutscenes, but by scanning objects, an interesting plot develops), I realized something: I was not just playing a game. I was having a life experience--one that rivaled any other, "real-life" accomplishment. Buy this game, and you too will go on the ride of a lifetime.	1
I never thought Metroid could be revived with lush, 3-D graphics. I thought the Metroid series was dead, especially after Metroid:Fusion, a game that goes against everything that is Metroid.  Boy was I wrong.....  Metroid Prime is one of the greatest games I have ever had the fortune of playing. Even though the graphics are 3-D, and beautiful, it still retains everything that made Metroid and Super Metroid masterpieces, it still has the feeling of being on a desolate, isolated planet, waging an epic war against the space pirates with a one-manned army that is Samus. Before Metal Gear, and as far as my research goes, even before the first Zelda game, there was Samus. It is hard to believe that with the high standards of Metroid fans, Metroid Prime was still as much a success as it was, and is. I can't really comment on whether this game is as good as Metroid or Super Metroid, because those games were 2-d, and this is 3-d, thus it would be unfair. However, this is one of the greatest games of all time, and here is why...  Graphics-99/100 Wow, Retro Studios really outdid themselves. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, better than anything I have seen to date. As much as I hate to admit it, graphics have always played a major role in Metroid games. The first Metroid for NES had amazing , groundbreaking graphics, with excrutiating details in the backrounds. Remember the purple, orb like things in Norfair in the original Metroid? That is what I am talking about. The only problem I have with Metroid Prime, if I had to think of one, would be that the surroundings aren't as creepy as the other games in the series.  Tallen Overworld is reminiscent of the first Turok game for N64, just with Metroid flavor. The Phazon Mines and Magmoor Caverns bring in a pretty good atmosphere, but I wasn't a huge fan of the Phendrana Drifts environments, I think they were a little too typical for a Metroid game. Even so, even the Phendrana Drifts environments look beautiful, if not 100 % Metroid. But the thing abaout the Metroid series I guess, is that they always do groundbraking things. Super Metroid took the original and blew it out of the water, and Metroid Prime doesn't disappoint at all. I think the graphics in this game are about as good as they could possibly ever have been, and I couldn't as for better. The beams also look pretty awesome, and still stand by the classic Metroid beams.  Music/sound- 95/100 Definitely wonderful in this aspect as well. The music is very atmospheric and sets the tone almost all of the game. The music, in my opinion, isn't quite the dark, atmospherically beautiful masterpiece that was Super Metroid, but it definitely sets the tone and gets it done when it has to. I particularly like the Tallen Overworld , Phendrana Drifts , and Chozo Ruins themes. The music is much more electro sounding than other Metroid games, but still is quite an aural pleasure. Oh yeah, the Meta Ripley theme is pretty awesome as well (basically a remake of the original Ridley theme from Super Metroid, one of my all time favorite Metroid themes.  Controls- 100/100 Brilliant, the c- pad works great as a beam switcher, and the control pad switches the visors. Every single controller set- up is flawless, and Samus controlls as good as ever, now able to lock on and even do side dashes.  Overall- 98/100 This game is as close to perfection as it gets these days, and is worth it for everyone to buy, especially since it is only about 15-20 bucks. Buy it, you won't regret it.	1
I love this game.  It's just too awesome to describe what makes it so great, but I'll try.  Graphics:  Anyone who says that the graphics suck, is either a XBox/PS2 fanboy, or has a really bad vision complex.  The graphics are stunning.  Best that I have seen on the 'Cube.  The environments are huge and well textured, and very detailed.  You'll find yourself staring at them in awe without the ability to move your jaw and even your body.  They are that good  Music: Though it's nothing I'd listen to daily, the music is very atmospheric.  It fits in prefectly with the type of the thing you're doing.  It is also pretty creepy when you're fighting agaisn't the Space Pirates and Troopers.  Sometimes I run for the doors that I'm so scared.  Difficulty:  Well, the first time playing it, it was difficult.  In fact, too dificult.  But, once you get used to the controls and such, it becomes fairly easy.  The creatures wandering about aren't that hard, but some of the bosses surely are (try beating Thardus on hard... it's nearly impossible).  Anyone who gives it a star for being to hard needs to get some skill and a brain instead of whining like a girl.  Controls:  This is where the game falters a bit.  I, as well as others, believe this game should have at least had the option of dual analog.  Even so, however, I think the contol scheme it has is perfect for the type of game it is, an exploration based shooter.  It's easy to switch arm cannos and visors, and so is laying bombs in morphball mode.  It's all very intuitive.  Oh, and by the way, just because it automatically locks on for you, this game is anywhere from simple.  Other things I'd like to mention is the amount of upgrades; there are tons of them.  You can collect over 50 missile upgrades, four missisle combos which are very powerful, a lot of energy tanks and 8 power bombs.  The storyline is great such that it's not layed out for you; you use your scan visor to scan and read it as you go through the game.  This game is epic and therefore should take you about 15-25 hours to beat it the first time, but it's well worth it.	1
To me, this game might just be the best game out there for the gamecube system. First of all, it has THE BEST graphics I have seen so far on the gamecube, and it THE BEST gameplay I seen so far on the gamecube. Samus has four different beams, and four different visors, and with all this stuff you know the gameplay is gonna be good. Even though some may dissagree, this is most likely the best game for the Nintendo Gamecube.	1
this game has good graphics and fun gameplay the bosses are fun the weapons are cool and i found extremely challenging.  Well pretty much the game is you go around searching in phenedrana drifts chozo ruins tallon overworld magamoor caverens and the phazon mines searching for your lost upgrades.  upgrades include  weapons:power beam, wave beam, ice beam, plasma beam  weapons secondary:super missle, wave buster, flamethrower, ice spreader.  morph ball:morph ball, Morph ball bomb, power bomb, boost ball, spider ball.  suits:power suit, varia suit, gravity suit, phazon suit,and if so the fusion suit.  visors:scan visor, normal visor, thermal visor, x-ray visor.  other: grapple beam.  then theres 50 missle expansions and 15 energy capsules or whatever there called.  theres 20 extra expansions good luck finding them	1
To tell you a little about me tastes, I love action/adventures games (Metal Gear Solid mainly). I own a Gamecube and a PS2 but I rarely touch my Gamecube because the games I like for it aren't much. I only own 4 games (including this one). I got Zelda Wind Waker, Eternal Darkness, MGS Twin Snakes. There was so much talk about Metroid Prime being great and all, but it looked like a first person shooter mainly so I wasn't that interested. I finally decided to purchase this game to give it a try and big surprise, I love it. First off, it doesn't feel like a FPS, it is incredibly fun and the exploration is adictive unlike WInd Waker which I found annoying compared to Ocarina of Time. The jumping system,... it is unbelievable the great it works!!!!  The areas are huge but everytime you aquire a new upgrade for your weapon, morph, visors or suits, you want to go back to reach some places that you couldn't earlier. Even if this game doesn't have too much story, you won't get annoyed at all by that. The fun of this game will make you forget this point. Highly Recommended.	1
Metroid Prime is an excellent game.  Not absolutely perfect, but still excellent.  Even now, more than two years after its initial release, this is still a must-have for the Game Cube.  People keep calling this game an FPS (First Person Shooter), but it really isn't.  This is an adventure platformer in 3-d.  It requires strategy and exploration to complete.  Players will find themselves returning to locations time and time again in order to unlock new secrets and rooms, unlike in a true FPS where levels are never revisited.  The game world is quite seamless.  The environments are rich and detailed, but not overwhelming.  The monsters are, for the most part, native animals that blend in well to their homes.  And the plot is well-paced, never seeming too fast or too slow.  The learning curve is quite steep, because the controller setup is not typical for such first-person-perspective games.  But once the player has become accustomed to the controls, play becomes fluid and intuitive.  The lock-on targeting system works well, and allows for a wide range of movement.  The relative difficulty of dodging and evasive moves is the one potential sticking point.  This game is quite challenging, but generally not overly so.  But it can get quite frustrating if you can't find the one item you need to proceed at any given point.  This happened to me about two hours into the game, and after several more hours of fruitless searching, I was literally snarling at my tv set in anger.  Eventually, I had to go to an on-line walkthrough at gamefaqs.com to find the item I was missing.  One other problem is that there is a bug in the game that sometimes causes it to freeze when you use the very first elevator between the Landing Site and the Chozo Ruins.  You definitely want to save your game before using this elevator.  There is very little to complain about in terms of the graphics.  They are fluid and highly detailed, again without being overwhelming.  At a few places there is a tiny bit of slowdown, and in some of the cut-scenes the character movement seems oddly slow and robotic.  But those occasions are few and far between.  The graphics are brilliant overall.  The little details, in particular, really draw the player in.  For example, as other people have mentioned, if the light flashes in just the right way, for a split-second you will see the reflection of Samus Aran on the inside of the visor.  The music is moody and atmospheric.  It always sets the tone perfectly.  Plus, musical transitions when entering a new area are so smooth that you barely notice the music has changed.  Sound effects, such as terrain noises, monster growls, and the odd language of the Space Pirates, are all quite wonderful at setting the scene.  Samus Aran herself never speaks, but then she has no companions to talk to.  Ultimately, she comes across as exactly what she is: a silent, stoic ass-kicker.  The game has a fair amount of replay value, as well.  There are three separate endings, the only difference between them being how much of the ending is actually revealed.  Which of these three endings you get depends on how many things you scan using the scan visor.  You only get the third, most revealing ending if you scan 100% of the log book entries.  There are also several picture galleries that can be unlocked based, again, on how much of the log book scans you get, as well as how often you beat the game.  Beating the game also unlocks "hard mode", as well as a couple extras you can get by linking to the GameBoy Advance game, "Metroid Fusion".  So, to sum up, not perfect but still an excellent game.  If you have a Game Cube, get "Metroid Prime".  Period.	1
This is a half-decent FPS. However, it's nothing short of a mockery of Metroid. The gameplay is clunky, the graphics are poor (highlights are not white light, consult any second year illustrator and he'll tell you), and the controls are terrible.	-1
im not really into first person view games sthe only ones i play would be like halo,counter strike, and this. the first time i saw this game i thought it be a horrible game since it was diffrent game style of play than the other metroid games but i was surprised how good this game is. you can do many things in that game and it can play the original metroid if you have the game boy advanced link and metroid fusion.	1
Before I start, I'll mention that I've played every Metroid game, except for the second one that was on the old monochrome Gameboy.  That said, I love the series.  I loved the 2D gameplay mechanics the games have, especially from Super Metroid.  If any game failed in my eyes, you wouldn't hear the end of it from me.  Well... all I can say about Metroid Prime is... I'm shocked!  I still don't understand how, but it's like Metroid Prime captured the essence of a 2D Metroid game and put it into 3D.  Anyway, lets go through this piece by piece.  First, the visuals.  All I can say is "wow!"  Metroid games have always been very atmospheric (or at least Super Metroid was), but I never thought they'd be able to duplicate that sense of atmosphere into a 3D Metroid.  Everything here is done well, from the sheer beauty of some of the environments, to the awesome visor effects (refering to visor modes AND visual effects, like water dripping off of it after coming out of water), to the sense of nostalgia breathed into full 3D that I'm still amazed was executed so well.  Even better is that this game runs super smoothly, and loading delays are far and few between.  Those loading delays only happen when you travel to a different sector, of which there are only about 6 or 7.  It should be noted there is quite a bit of backtracking, so you'll be dealing with that more than it sounds, though they've lessened the burden of loading delays by keeping the action going continually.  In between sectors, you simply see Samus being transported from one sector to the next via elevator, so you're pretty much going to have something happening all the time, unless you pause the game.  Sound-wise, I only have one complaint.  There is one particular enemy you meet later in the game that has a sound effect that's rather hard on the ears.  Fitting, but hard on the ears.  Other than that, everything in this game is done well.  All the better if you have surround sound.  More often then not, you'll hear enemies before you see them.  The music helps add to the environment, though this is one of those soundtracks that wouldn't be much on it's own, so don't expect to see a music CD with the soundtrack for Metroid Prime.  The controls in this game are better than I expected.  While they can take a while to get the hang of if you're used to a keyboard and mouse setup for these kinds of 3D games, once you get into it, the controls become second nature.  Better yet, the game is built so that everything is easy to control.  You may be surprised at how easy the grapple beam is to use, though you'd better be more coordinated than my brother-in-law is.  The best part is that jumping seems to be easier to execute in this game than most other games.  The view tilts down just a little bit so that you can guage how far it is until you reach the platform.  The best thing by far is the fact that the beam weapon and missles have their own button.  If you want to use a missle, it's as easy as pressing a button, though don't get to comfortable switching weapons like that.  They programmed a slight delay when you switch from missle to beam, which makes sense because you are using both out of the same arm cannon.  There's also a cool feature called "auto lock-on," which allows you to target an enemy using a button, but more on that in the next paragraph.  Gameplay is where the final bit of my sense of awe with this game comes in.  By all rights and measures, this game actually feels like a Metroid game.  Everything from the fights to the simple, yet fun, puzzles just screams "I am a Metroid game."  Not only that, but it's a sheer testament to the game and it's developers that the auto lock-on feature doesn't hinder the difficulty of the game.  In fact, some of the enemies (particularly bosses) actually utilize the feature in a variety of ways, such as only being able to target under certain visor modes, or targeting specific parts of an enemy, such as arms and legs.  The scan system works into this as well, giving you detailed information on enemies in the game and how to defeat them, if you can.  Along with that, several objects themselves can be scanned for information, including Space Pirate computer databases.  If you are the type that loves to explore, you will have fun using this feature.  All in all, Metroid Prime is one of the absolute best games on the gamecube.  In my mind, it easily rivals Halo and other FPS games out there (keeping in mind, Metroid Prime IS NOT an FPS!  It doesn't play like an FPS, it just looks like one).  However, from what I've heard of reactions from others that have played this game, it seems this is one of those "love it or hate it" games.  If you think there is a possibility you might hate it, either rent it or borrow it from someone.  You at least owe it to yourself to play this game a little bit to see if you'll like it.  I know I like this game... a lot!	1
This game is so much fun.  The graphics are phenominal, and the story-line for it is great.  I highly reccomend this game, especially if you are looking for games that involve stratagy, action, and adventure.	1
Amazing is what I have to say about Retro Studios masterpiece Metroid Prime which is based on the oh so popular Metroid Series and This carries the tradtion of the Metroid Games.  I honestly thought Retro was gonna do a horrible job making a Classic nintendo game into a some what Fp perspective game with a 3d look but they sure proved me wrong.  Metroid Prime is not only one of the best Gamecube games ever but it is simply a masterpiece.  From the amazing 3d atomspheric graphics to doing some really great puzzle solving.  Metroid Prime never loses its touch and just keeps gaining strengh at what it's best at.  When I first got this game back when it first hit stores I was not that excited but after 5 minutes Lets put it this way.....wow.  That is what came out of my mouth when I played this amazing game.  I honestly don't know what you can find wrong about it.  It has some awesome gameplay like the visors which are an awesome in this game.  The beams are just oh so delightfull and keeps you on the game and won't let you go.  Not many games keep me up at night just making me play through and keep goin on to see what's the next chapter but Metroid Prime is one of those games that kept me up alll night and that really shows how great this game is.  I'll say it again it is simply amazing and I loved it.  Lets get to it  The graphics is beautiful.  The atmosphere in this game is pure and wonderful.  The waterfall, the huge world your in it's just...wow.  Retro proved to us what they can do with the Metroid series and the graphics are one of them.  The graphics are very detailed and takes your breath away.  If you have a problem with the graphics then you really are an idiot.  The gameplay is very well done.  Scanning things are fun to do and there are lots of things to do in this huge world your in.  You pretty much have to collect items like Missiles, Bombs, Upgrades, Combos for your weapons, and Beams and the best part...VISERS! There is filled with things to do in this game and gameplay just keeps getting better.  The best part of the game play by far is the beams.  You have selected choice of beams well it depends on how many you've gotten.  There are some weapon beams you have to look for through out the game like the ice beam, lava beam and more.  And then you can find combos for that beam which makes the game even more fun but it sucks cause it takes away your missile.  The average amount of Missiles is like 250 I think but I beat the game with 215 and it's not easy and if you beat the game with less then 100 then you really are good.  With all that great stuff to do how can you not like the gameplay?  It's awesome!  The sound is wonderful.  I loved the music in the game.  It was breath of fresh air for me.  Some of the songs are very memorable.  Each music senario went with the room or location of the game that you are in.  It really went well with it.  I loved the sound of the creatures you fight.  The sound and music is very detailed.  Lemmi put it this way...THE SOUND IS GOOD.  The Good -The visuals are just so beautiful -The world is so atmospheric and beautiful -A huge world to explore -Getting 100% and everything = 26-30 hours of some of the best gameplay ever -The Bosses acctually make you think! -The level desighn for some of the areas are just brilliant as well as the puzzles -who is complaining about Controls?...They're perfect, you probably stink at the game.. -THE MUSIC IT SELF IS 5 STARS!  The bad -.......um..lets get back to the good : )  This game is amazing, awesome and is not only one of the best GCN games but it is also one of the best games ever made.  Metroid Prime is another classic in the Metroid series and with all the hard work Retro Studio has done why wouldn't you give them credit for this game?  From awesome music to amazing graphics, Memorable Boss Battles like the Omega Pirate and Meta Ridley.  Not to mention the hours of finding beams, beam upgrades, bombs, Visers, combos, scaning things.  This game will have you up all night.  It will probably take about 18 to 20 hours if your aiming for a 90-95% ending like the one I went for.  Metroid Prime succeeds in aspect and that is why I am giving this amazing game a  5 out of 5 stars!!!  If you have a gamecube...GET THIS GAME!  Lates	1
i hope i spelled echelons right.  anyhow, it's three o clock in the morning of tuesday, november 16th, today i get to pick up metroid prime 2: echoes.  and for the last couple of days i've been reliving all the fun i had with the first Prime.  going back, i still can't believe how real the world of Tallon IV feels.  water streaks down your visor and mist and steam fog it up.  everything is very detailed, which only adds to this titles superiority over a lot of other high end action games.  but this title isn't all action.  there is a little bit of everything here.  puzzles, strategy.  adventure.  some rpg elements.  and there are even multiple endings to keep you going back through it a few times.  you unlock new stuff in the gallery (and get different end game cinemas) depending on how much important stuff you scanned on your way through the game.  so if it's your first time, scan everything.  the game wasn't extremely easy, and it wasn't extremely hard.  it was that happy little place in the middle that brought back fond memories of the old NES days.  even though i never played the original Metroid games (the first one, which can be unlocked in Prime), i could still feel the old school gameplay elements perfectly tied into the 3D world.  the different beam weapons you get are all cool and unique, although one could say they are nothing special.  sure, they are just fire, ice, the purple one...what is that?  energy?, and the regular beam cannon.  but all can be upgraded to be used with your missiles to do cool "combos".  all except the ice cannon, i wonder what happened to that one...  all of Samus' (the main character, a woman bounty hunter preotected by a life-time garaunteed suit of armor) moves are cool.  from the morph ball (damn she's limber) and it's offspring, like the spider ball and morph ball bombs and the fun, yet difficult to master bomb jumping.  her grappling hook/beam is in full effect, too.  swinging around in the different environments is just plain fun. from the steamy underbelly known as The Magmoor Cavers, filled with lava and gaseous floating things; to the freezing wasteland known as Phendrana Drifts, with its raging snow beasts and beautiful landscapes.  in the beginning of the game, you start out with all your basic stuff: grapple beam, powerbeam shot, varia suit (which protects you from heat), morph ball and morph ball bombs, and missiles.  but upon finishing off the first boss, you lose all of these precious things and end up chasing the alien creature known as Meta Ripley to the mysterious planet of Tallon IV.  there, you arrive in the lush, amazon like habitat of the Chozo Ruins.  now, only equipped with the regular beam cannon and scan visor, and the ability to jump, you set out on a quest to gather info on the new planet and find new stuff.  sure, there's really no story, but who cares?  platforming is done very easily somehow from the first person perspective of this game and the action is fast and fun.  you get different visors to help you out on your quest to do...stuff, and the entire adventure is well worth your time.  and the unlockable stuff is another good reason to keep going through it.  there is also a hard mode, that is as it says, hard.  but fear not, the game never really gets insanely hard.  i had a little trouble with the end boss.  i kept getting killed when i thought i almost had him beat, and then when i finally survived and realized he had a whole different form that i had to defeat, i felt a lump in my throat.  but it soon went away, as the final version of the end boss is well designed and one of the coolest bosses around.  whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer looking for a good change of pace, pick this up.  you can get it pretty cheap nowadays and i would highly recommend getting this if you're going to pick up it's sequel.  overall, fantastic game and well worth your time, money and effort.	1
Blinx: The Time Sweeper ( made by: Microsoft ) is a AWESOME game to play on the Xbox game conosle I give it 5 Stars "High Recommended" REALLY WORTH IT TO BUY AND PLAY this game on Microsoft Xbox Blinx: The Time Sweeper If anybody own a XBOX game console THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE TO GET AND PLAY IT ( YOU WILL REALLY LIKE THIS GAME )	1
After being told it was the best game ever, I bought this game and was very very disappointed. You walk around lost half the game, get an idea of what to do and where to go then get lost again for another 30 minutes. I am usually very good at harder more complex puzzling games, but this one just pushes the limit. 2 stars for graphics those were pretty good.	-1
Okay, first of all, I do not own this game. My brother does. There. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I shall proceed with my review.  I'm not going to bore you all with the storyline; it's probably apparent to all of you. I'm going straight into gameplay, and the gameplay is wonderful. One would think that because the trigger buttons aren't used for shooting is a con to the game. It's not. All the buttons work correspondingly. I also like the unique scanning method, which allows Samus to gain valuable infromation on enemies, Space Pirate data, and Chozo stories.  Now that I look back at it, though, the game's story plays like that of the Wind Waker (a Legend of Zelda game) in the sense that you do lots of exploring and picking up elemental weaponry.  The graphics of this game nuked me right off the planet. The atmospheres are so well done - the rain in Tallon IV, the fumes at Magmoor Caverns...wonderful. The enemies are well animated, too (My personal favorites are the Pirates themselves, and the Metroids). The unique thing to me is that this is one game I've played where an atmospheric environment isn't made simply for eye candy.  The difficulty? Well, I'll have to say that this game is NOT an easy one. It's NOT for impatient people, as there you have to do a lot of scanning and reading to fully enjoy this one. The enemies are pretty tough too - If you think the Pirates are weak because they were easy to beat at the begining, you'll be taking that back later in the game. And what's a Metroid game without Metroids? Yes, those lovable jellyfish-like creatures are back, and they won't hesitate to suck the energy out of anyone. And I mean ANYONE (It's hilarious watching Metroids attack the Pirates). The bosses are provide much challenge too--part of the challenge involves scanning them for their weak spots...kind of like the fairy in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  Overall, buy this only if you are the patient type. If you aren't, don't be seduced by the wonderful graphics, because you won't like this game.	1
THIS GAME SUCKS &*@#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First of all, THIS GAME IS SO HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it sucks! I cant even get through the first level without getting stuck 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 times!!!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY THIS *!$*&#* $!& GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Great game.	1
Love it!	1
Still fun 12 years later	1
Great graphics and innovative time controls. May be too difficult and frustrating for some, especially younger players. Good deal for the $5 I paid.	1
Great game. I know I am behind in the times with video games but its a great game to play.	1
I've only played the old NES, SNES, etc. Metroids back in the day a few times, but they're all pretty goofy alien shoot 'em up games which are surprisingly addictive. Other than no nude codes for Spamus Arang or whatever the biotch's name is, this game rocks in a lot of ways.  The graphics are outstanding, particularly the Morph ball and some of the backgrounds.  The sound is cool, and the soundtrack is alien and at times kinda eerie and exotic.  The weapons and upgrades are much cooler than the rest of the games in the series due to the vastly improved graphics of the good old 'Cube.  The story is a bit hard to get into if you don't know a whole lot about the other games, but it's unique and even fantastic at times. This game is a winner, BUT probably won't appeal to all gamers due to it being a bit on the wierd side.  (But hey this is Metroid, and it's not supposed to be realistic really).	1
I give this game five stars hands down for seamless gameplay, nice visuals, and simple control.  When you get stuck between a wave pirate and an elite, you will thank Retro Studios for the simpler controls. Samus is a little slow in the game, but not THAT slow. With the weapons she's packing, she can afford to be patient.  She is a hunter, not a track sprinter. To clear up one thing:  You don't need to scan everything to 100% the game, you need to collect all the weapon and suit upgrades.  If you want access to all the picture galleries, then you need to scan everything.  which can be somewhat frustrating because many enemies only show up once when you first encounter them. I wanted to mention that the placement of the save stations is key in the difficulty of the game, being able to save at anytime, or being able to have a save station in every other room would cause the game to be too easy.  I thouroughly enjoyed this game and half of the reasoning is founded on the fact that I had to work harder and sustain myself until I made it to the next save station.  I see the argument that it might need more save stations, but the game isn't so difficult that you can't finish it, you just need to change your strategy, perhaps realizing that this is not your average FPS and is more or less an exploratory adventure game would help.  Going full boar into heated situations with space pirates is not a good strategy, they need to be dealt with no more than 2 or 3 at a time.  So, pace your steps and pick them off when they can't surround you.  Most of the enemies in this game have significant weaknesses that are easy to exploit.  I prefer to use the Ice Beam followed closely by a missle or two.  Another key is to use the power shots, they will always deal better damage than a bunch of smaller shots.  Especially the Super Missles. The game gives you enough energy to make it to each save station. The hardest part of the game is the Boss of the Phazon Mines, and with the right strategy, it'll go down too.  This is a flawless transition from a 2D environment to a more lush amazing 3D environment,  I can only sit and smile in anticipation of Prime 2. Those of you who are comparing this game to any others are in serious need of some classes on comparisons, no games can be compared to this one, it stands alone in it's own type. Not because it is better, but because it simply stands alone.  I will not live in a world where only one or two games reign supreme, I like a variety and Metroid Prime definitly ups the ante in the variety department. The concept of liking more than one game should not be foreign to anyone.  Halo is a good game.  There are plenty of other games that are good.  This one is too.  I wasn't going to write a review, but I also wasn't going to let ignorant people take apart this game for reasons that I found it to be extrordinary.	1
I love this game wish it was available on the other systems.it is easy to play. me and my son enjoy this	1
As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point.  I like to think that there's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super-detailed realism. Generally, a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game, because they're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic, lifelike location. Cartoons, on the other hand, generally don't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time. How much fun would the Wile E. Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate, it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics? Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that's overly detail-centric in an environment that's right out of a kid's show. The result is a tale that comes off as way, WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract. It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way.  Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world, how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear, the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic. There's a princess, evil pigs have kidnapped her, and it's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world. That's it, no side-stories, no reasoning, no subplots - just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B. And here I thought the phrase "save the princess" was universally recognized as an ages-old cliche.  Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm railing on this game just because it's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor. It's also completely lacking in character development, general storytelling and ongoing inspiration. None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals, including the lead character himself. You don't hate the pig on the spaceship because he's trying to destroy the world, you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money. I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three, because she's never mentioned between the game's start and its finish. I mean, the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight.  I don't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging. The first level and a half are set up in the standard "get to know you" format, with the simplest of enemies, the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools. Shortly thereafter, you're thrown to the wolves. For the most part, the level designs are very short, with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge. I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts, whether it's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk (har har) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point. You'll almost always know what needs to be done, but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick. I just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is. If there's a bottomless pit nearby, (and chances are very good that there is) Blinx will find a way to force himself into it, regardless of what you're hitting on the control pad. If there's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button, he'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room, rather than the imminent threat.  That's not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit, because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table, but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings. The ability to control time, for instance, was at the time a really fresh, interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today, despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged. You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge, pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time, knock the level into slow motion, etc. All the while, Blinx is moving around in real time. It's a great idea, but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized. Why can't I use two controls at the same time? Why don't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers? Why doesn't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause, speed up or rewind when I use my time powers? Why is their duration so brief, and why can't I hold more than a dozen uses at a time? I mean, this could've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer.  The controls, too, are an undeveloped, undertested nightmare. Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond, especially when implementing his time controls. He has difficulty making a precise turn, whether on midair or on solid ground. He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item, which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks. He routinely moves in the direction of certain death, as though pulled by a magnetic field, whether you've instructed him to do so or not. He'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump, particularly when attempting a difficult, precise leap across a gaping chasm.  I think it's these controls that most make Blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating. At a glance, you'd imagine they'd be fairly difficult to screw up. You've got a jump button, a suction / fire button, a time control button and an analog stick to control movement. Plus, there had already been a long, established line of three-dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title's release, paving the way to an ideal control experience. Super Mario 64 had its issues, sure, but nothing like this, and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre's jump to the world of 3D. It's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway.  I can't even say I'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper, either. With the exception of the lead character himsef, these are some incredibly cheesy, preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished and hurried, less purposeful than you'd imagine (especially in contrast with Blinx himself). Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels, trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury. Here's a finely detailed main character, with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again, and he's pitted against a set of monsters that could've sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four-year-old's sketchbook.  Despite featuring a spoken dialog track, there's no English voice acting. I couldn't pinpoint the language, but my wife seems to think it's either French or some close variation of it. It certainly didn't sound Japanese. While this does add a touch of personality to the title, and it's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love, it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television. Everyone's vocal personalities are so black-and-white, too, that I feel like a great chance to establish some much-needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here. The bad guys all have the same deep, gravelly, transparently evil tone, while the good guys are all bright, cheery, squeaky and high-pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball. It's like a parody of the games that had come before, but I won't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose.  Overall, Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package, strapped to the shell of a far-below-average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. At the time of its release, it was still in need of a lot of polishing, some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re-evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half-hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality. On top of that, I really don't know which audience they were targeting with it. The game is ridiculously difficult, which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there, but so bright, kid-friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day. The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx, reaching near-Marvel vs. Capcom 2 levels with its unashamed, excruciatingly cheap hits, especially in later levels. I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight.  The game is adequately lengthy, and offers some replay value, with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches, promotional materials and the like. Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super-tough later levels, though, you'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place. Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps (I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process) and enjoy self-mutilation, I'd recommend you stay far away.	-1
Metroid Prime is perfect. That is all the review a real gamer would need to put for this game, seriously. Bottom Line: Unless you're either lazy and give up on things just because you couldn't get it right the first time around, or you(for some odd reason) hate the action/adventure gameplay that made the Metroid series great, Get. This. Game. Now. I dare you to honestly say you don't like it. I dare you.	1
All i got to say that this game is AWESOME to the max. Very pretty and well made for a game that can be considered old. Also i love the effects like when a fire beast kind of thing attacks you you can see Samus's reflection inside the helmet. WOW also game hest huge amount of upgrades and extra things to find. The whole game actualy is a huge puzzle which is fun to unlock. You will be coming back to areas you have been just to open the dooryou could not before. Sound effects are great. Also developers did a nice job with boss batlles WOW like the one with a huge rock dude that can shoot rocks at you and stuff it was so detailed and dynamic yey! Me and my bro could not stop playing we did not get the story but it sure did not stop us from unlocking 87% of the huge world. And yeah te map of this planet is huge lots to explore. I have not beaten it yet but soon i will. Controls and gameplay is very unique for example your charachter has a couple of visors llike thermal and scaning thingy for invisble dudes. Also there is a huge databank to read on each monster and their weakneses. I am not a picky person what ever other flaws you saw i don't care all i care about is when i play i solve a puzzle and i get very good feeling. Hope i cleared something out for a shoper thank you.	1
I played this game right when it came out and i loved it. A HUGE 3D world of the misterious planet Talion (sp?) 5. I thought it was very well done as in the idea with the visors and beam selection and the storyline not to reveiling but just so you can get the jist of it. Very cool though i wrote a review for zero mission and the other games of the series. definatley plan on getting it. But the game isn't for everyone. Some of my own flesh tried it and couldn't stand it. Thought it was plain boring. (to think i share may have to donate my blood to them someday huh!) Anways all in all if you think youve got the patience and the love for the series this game is just for you. -so hungry-	1
When the word action game comes to mind, a smorgasbord of games comes to image. Metroid Prime is on the top of my list. This game plays by areas instead of levels. There is seamless graphics and absolutely no loading time. The frame rate has always maintained a steady 60 frames per second, and for all the times I played I haven't noticed a drop in frame rate nor a twitch or freeze when i played 6 hours straight. After the controls got some getting used to, then the real fun begins. I've got 3 words: BUY THIS GAME!	1
This game is an amazing platformer only for the Xbox game console.  I have to say that from my experience with it, it is excellent.  Many people dislike Blinx, and I'm not really sure why, but I'll tell you some of the many great things about this game. Plot: 4/5 As far as I've seen, the plot is to help Blinx save time from perishing forever and help rescue a character... Gameplay: 5/5 Use your time sweeper to suck in trash and hurl them at time monsters.  Defeat all the monsters in each stage and get to the goal to complete each stage.  At the end you are awarded gold. There are three stages, one shop and one boss per world. Graphics: 5/5 The environments in Blinx look so weird and creative, like strange, twisted and dark buildings.  This is one of the factors that makes Blinx original.  You can even see each individual hair on Blinx's head, which is very realistic. Features: 5/5 Now, here's where the real fun of the game starts.  Depending on whichever "time crystal" you acquire one of the following time events: Pause:  This requires blue time crystals.  Pause completely freezes all enemies in the stage for a set amount of time. Rewind:  Pink crystals required.  Rewind backtracks to stop a certain event from happening (i.e. A pillar falls on to an important item.  Use rewind to set the pillar back up and quickly snag the item), or to stop you from dying. Fast-forward: Orange crystals needed.  Fast-forward  just speeds things up (including you), and you are temporarily invincible. Record: Green crystals required.  Record duplicates Blinx, so as to do two things at once when needed, or to have an enemy chase after the fake while you attack it from behind. Slow-mo: Yellow crystals needed.  Slow-motion slows down all enemies so you can quickly dispose of them.   Other features of Blinx include finding special "cat medals" and gold to spend at shops for special upgrades and power-ups. Controls: 5/5 A button to jump, twice to double-jump.  Hold "X" to suck in trash, then tap it to shoot trash (keep in mind that you can only hold five trash pieces at a time).  Left toggle moves Blinx, while the right one controls the camera.  I don't want to go too much into control detail here, so you'll have to find out the rest of the controls on your own. Overall: 5/5! This is an unbelievably great game for Xbox, so get it right now and discover its great mysteries!	1
Blinx has had a hard time of it from some reviewers. OK, it's a linear platform game and Mario won't be losing any sleep but he's quite a charming character. I can't recall the plot exactly but, like every second platform game ever (and with this game revolving around controlling time), let's guess it involves some mad alien leader who needs all the time crystals to power his spaceship. The first thing you might notice if you have a Gamecube is how familiar it all seems. Yes, Blinx has stolen the hoover from Luigi's Mansion! ... Blinx also has the ground-breaking ability to control the fourth dimension- time. The implication is that Mario 64 brought you 3D platforming, Blinx gives you 4D! But any comparison would make Blinx look lightweight. Where Blinx excels is in the graphics, with Tim Burton-esque skies and silhouetted buildings and some excellent detail. Blinx is well drawn and the lighting and water effects are great but, unfortunately, most of the enemies are just nondescript blobs with eyes. Also, why do some rolling barrels simply pass through Blinx's body instead of killing or even hitting you? Nevertheless, you can tell that this is a graphical showcase for the Xbox made by an accomplished team- indeed it was made by Artoon, an offshoot from Sega. I picked up this little beauty for just 15, which was a bargain but bear in mind that it is beautiful but a bit shallow. Hopefully, any sequel will increase the challenge.	1
Graphics 10/10: This is Xbox of course it's going to get good graphics. It does have a wierd camera system at some points but you get used to it. Gameplay 6/10: This game is definetly original i'll give it that much, but it does get really boring after a while. The thing that really is annoying about this game is that you only get 10:00 to beat every level. Also you have to find "ammo" (better known as garbage) throughout every level. Sound 0/10: This sound is so annoying that I have actually gotten killed by getting annoyed at the sound and not paying attention. Replay Value 2/10: You can go back through the levels to get the medals but it gets boring really fast. Overall Score 4.5/10: If I were you don't get this game. It is for little kids mainly but some teenagers will like this game for a while.	-1
Blinx is an amazing game all the way around. It is the weirdest game I have player yet, but that is what makes it sooooo fun! Here is the lowdown... Graphics: 4-D! Great graphics! The worlds are really cool, and everything about the graphics are cool! Gameplay: VERY ODD! This is the first game where you can pause, fast forward, rewind, etc. and this is what makes the game so much fun! You have to use strategy to beat this game. You can't just be good at video games to beat this game... you have to have a brain. Fun Factor: Very fun! The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because it can get a little aggravating when you can't get pass that certain level or you don't have an item you need, so you have to die. Pros -VERY FUN! -GRAPHICS (4-D) -Lots of levels Cons -1 hit your dead -short levels -odd Overall a great game! Depending on what you think by this review, this could be a must buy or a rent!	1
Blinx is one of the better platformers I've played, and definitely worth purchasing. You play as Blinx, a cat whose job is to fix problems with time. To aid him in his job, Blinx has a number of abilities which allow him to control time, and that's what makes this game unique. You can collect various time-altering abilities such as pause, rewind, and record that will be necessary to solve the puzzles in each level. For example: suppose you are at the base of a crumbled statue, and want to get at something that's high in the air. Jump on a part of the statue, hit rewind, and watch as the statue re-forms before your eyes, carrying you to the top. Suppose you need to activate two switches at the same time. Record yourself activating the first switch, then play it back, and hit the second while your duplicate hits the first. Sound cool? It is! With 33 levels (including the final boss), this game will keep you playing for a good while. Many of the levels are rather difficult and will require several attempts, and you'll also have to re-visit old levels in order to stock up on time crystals from time to time. Furthermore, there are medals hidden in each stage that you can collect to unlock secrets in the game, so there is some replay value to be had. (The first few secrets are wholly unintersting, but keep going; the later ones are better.) So, what keeps this from being a five-star game? Primarily, it's because of problems with the camera. The game's camera will often end up being positioned very badly, and although you can adjust it with the right analog stick, it won't always stay where you set it. Needless to say, this can be very frustrating. It's certainly not enough to make the game unplayable, but you'll likely lose a couple of lives because of it. A related issue is the auto-aim system that Blinx uses. The game locks on to the nearest enemy to aid you in aiming, which is often helpful, except for one problem: you can't choose which enemy you're aiming at. If you're in the room with two enemies, and the one farther away is the greater threat, you might very well want to take out that one first. But the game will probably aim at the nearer one instead. The only thing you can do is move Blinx into a position where the enemy you want to shoot at is closer. Some way to deactivate the auto-aim would have been very welcome. Aside from that, we have a few minor problems. There's no story to speak of except for one opening movie, and one at the end. It would be nice if there were some kind of brief story sequences between rounds, but that's not a huge complaint for a platformer. I also would have tightened up the collision detection between Blinx and the time crystals; sometimes when two crystals are very close together, I have trouble getting the one I want without ending up with the other as well. Bottom line: this game gets a 7.5 out of 10. If they had cleaned up the camera and auto-aim issues, it would have been a 9. The game's problems don't detract from it enough to pass it by, though. Blinx makes an excellent addition to anyone's XBox library.	1
Metriod prime is a classic that should not be missed.  Every one kept thinking it would turn out to be horrible cause it was made by an american company in texas(thtas not prety cool to diss txes like that)  well than when the game came out boy were alota people sad for dissing them like that.....turns out mp was one of the best shooters out  right now! samus aron rules in this game.  Move out masterchief..theres a new chick in town.  I think metriod prime was waaaaaaaaay betta than halo and I COULD give a rats lower torsoe what you people think of.  The game rocks ok.  The graphics are amazingly well done.  THe bosses are fun and awsome....and some quit tough. there are alota stuff you need to get inorder to beat this game. beam,ice beam,plasma beam,wave beam,power bomb, combos such as super missle launcher,flame thrower and ect. The game is very atmospheric.  Better than halo I can tell you that.  The places are brilliantly done is such manner you just fall in love with this game cause it is that good!  The hunter returns in this atmospheric work of art wich may make alota people wanting for more.  The bosses are fun parts and some what frustraiting.  Esspecially when you have to acctually fight metriod prime!  The bosses are over all the best part of the game and also the stuff you get.  Lets not forget that now.  Youll be getting variouse types of suit to fit in this world such as Choso Ruins, Tallon overworld,Phendrana drifts and the game is very difficult when you play it the first time. Youll need to get some stuff before you're off to your next quest like after you have gotten one of the suits youll need to look for things such as missile expansions and you have to have about 250!! Yeah that sucks I know But once you get all your stuff its ayy ok.  Also the energy tanks are very important.  Youll need them if you're gonna wanna survive this game. BOTTOM LINE IS GET THE GAME!. Well lata gamaz	1
this is an amazing game. i would go into a very inspiring review but this game doesnt need it. this game is so detailed and complete. nothings missing. buy it. playit. its not that hard.  its so fun to get power ups.  it revolutionized its genre. its true to metroid. beat the game its worth it. its cheap now. you got nothing to lose. you know its a good game. get it.	1
Metroid Prime can be connected to the newly released Metroid Fusion via the Game Boy Advance Link, unlocking two bonus features. Completing Fusion unlocks the entire original Metroid on the Gamecube. They've actually improved upon the original Metroid by adding the ability to save within the game. Completing Prime opens up the ability to play Metroid Prime with a Fusion suit. This change is only cosmetic, as it doesn't grant Samus any new voodoo powers or the ability to talk with the Metroids.	1
This is my third time entering the Metroid universe, and this is by far the best!  Great graphics, awesome unlockables, and intricate puzzles make this quite possibly the best FPS yet!  The music is awesome, too, except for fighting the Chozo Ghosts, which is music on par with the muzak you hear while on hold with most major companies. BTW, I am assuming that the game is too hard for the other reviewers, assuming none of them can spell.	1
To me, this is simply a work of art.  If you own a Gamecube and you haven't played this game, you are missing out. I don't know how to classify this game.  It's kind of like a FPS except there is too much exploration and puzzle solving (which I think is a good thing.) The controls were simple enough and the gameplay is awesome.  The different weapons, the upgrades that allow you to open new possibilities, I could go on forever.  If you come in with the right expectation (I see a reviewer saying that this game didn't meet his expectation because it wasn't an RPG.  Uhh, hello.  Why didn't you read the reviews and figure out that it wasn't an RPG before you bought the game.  I would be disappointed if I rented the Godfather thinking it was porn, but that doesn't make the Godfather a disappointing movie.  I just didn't make the right selection.  Ok, enough rambling.) As always, a word of caution, if you don't like exploring and reading (and there is a lot of reading which is a big part of the game where you are scanning things with your visor to get information about your enemies and the world you are in), this game might test your patience.  But if you are a gamer, you cannot Not like this game.  Those who know about games (Game reviewers in Game magizines for example) basically give this game perfect scores across the board.  So who are you going to believe, the experts or some dude, who seem to not like people who likes Nintendo.	1
Good FPS with great graphics and gameplay. Good sci-fi story with some cool creatures and bosses which get tougher as you go. The controls are fast and tight. My only problem with the game is it gets a bit long due to going back to previous levels. Example- To aquire missle upgrades in level 2, one needs a boostball from level 4. While this is a bit irritating all in all the game is worth purchasing as it is a great shooter with one of the best stories ive played.	1
After the great Metroid Fusion, I could expect nothing less from the queen of shooters' excursion onto the GameCube--and I got everything and nothing I expected. Prime is nothing like the previous four Metroid games in terms of gameplay--but I'm not complaining. Prime sucked me in and kept me there, fighting past hordes of enemies and the toughest, most creative bosses in YEARS (thanks Nintendo!) and hunting for tough-to-reach powerups through incredibly innovative puzzles, and looking at some of the best graphics of any game on the GameCube. I'm not just saying that--one look at some of the best monsters ever created and you'll swear you'll never go back to PlayStation. And the game doesn't end with the awesome final fight--no, no, you can connect with your copy of Metroid Fusion to play the original Metroid on your 'Cube. Prime has at least fifteen hours of gameplay on that beautiful little Gamecube disc. Have fun with them.	1
My title for this review pretty much says it all.  The overall design of the game is very creative and imaginative and it's definitely not your everyday FPS.  The 3-D environment is huge and offers plenty of opportunities to explore, but the actual game play itself simply becomes torture after a while. First of all, let's discuss the enemies you encounter along the way.  For various reasons, you find yourself having to pass through completed areas again and again, but when you defeat an enemy and clear out an area, it's all for naught, as the next time you pass through the area, they have completely respawned and you have to do it all over again.  This becomes tiresome and repetitive very quickly. The game does not have a quick save or "save at any point" feature, however it does have "save rooms" scattered throughout the game.  The trouble is, the save room is often some distance away from the boss battles, and if you've defeated by a boss, you find yourself having to repeat a bunch of tedious game play  just to get back to the boss. The bosses in this game simply get ridiculously hard fairly quick, and after about 4 or 5 battles it becomes a real nightmare.  There is this one battle were you have to use your cannon or missiles to flip a series of mirrors off of the boss, and of course the whole time the boss is trying to kill you  AND the boss is flipping the mirrors back, undoing all your work.  And if this wasn't bad enough, you have to complete  this process not once, not twice, but ultimately 4 times.  That's not fun, it's torture. Metroid Prime is creative, imaginative, and definitely a different experience than your standard shoot'em up but the game play is so tortuous it completely ruins the experience.  The sad part is, with just a little tinkering, such as a quick save feature,  enemies that don't respawn, and less complicated boss battles, this game would have deserved the hype it gets.	-1
Blinx is an XBox game which reaches into the FOURTH dimension - the dimension of time. Use rewind, pause, and record to help solve puzzles and get through levels. First, the regular gameplay. You're Blinx, a cat that falls in love with a human princess on a doomed planet. As part of the 'time cleanup squad', you head in to vacuum up loose time crystals and to kill off time monsters. There are 10 levels, each made up of distinct stages and a boss. There's the normal arcady leaping, jumping, shooting of enemies. You look for secret cat-symbols to unlock little videos for fun. What adds an extra element of puzzle-solving is the fact that you can use time as well as skills to get to objects. Gathering combinations of crystals gives you the temporary ability to work with time. You can slow down, pause, fast forward, rewind or record time for short periods. So say you're walking to a bridge, and you watch as it collapses in front of you. No problem - just stand in front of the bridge and activate your 'rewind' skill. The bridge will go back to its crossable state, and you can cross quickly before time heads forwards again and it re-collapses. The ability is fun, but there are only distinct areas where you really use it. You see a broken statue, you rebuild it to get to something just above it. Or maybe you rebuild a fallen arch to get through to what was beyond. If there's a spot that requires two buttons to be pushed simultaneously, you record yourself pushing one button, and then play back the recording while you push the other one. For general gameplay, 'pausing' your enemies can be helpful, but you tend just to jump and attack to get through levels. The graphics are very nice, with the water-ripple effects being very well done. That seems to be true for just about every new generation game, though - something which was once a startling achievement is now almost expected to look realistic. The characters are a bit cutesy, but no more so than Mario or many other jumping-games out there. On the down side, the bosses can be really nasty and you can't progress to the next level until you get through one. You have a set 10 minute time limit on each section. This can be fine for adult gamers, but the younger ones may be too stressed and unable to complete levels, meaning they are stuck at that point. I've heard a lot of complaints about the camera system. I really didn't find it hard to use at all - it seemed quite intuitive - but maybe with the volume of games I play I get used to the variety of camera styles out there. Generally a good game, requiring more thought than the average jumper-gatherer game. If it's for a younger-than-teenager, I'd make sure an adult is around to help out with the puzzles and more complex parts, so the player isn't frustrated early and stuck at a standstill.	1
Mascots have to be the hardest thing for a video game company to establish. They are truly hit or miss when it comes to success and are beloved or hated by gamers based their appeal and gameplay. Mario wasn't actually an overnight success but now there cannot be a Nintendo system without a Mario game to go with it. Sega made one of the only *slight* successes at making a rival mascot with their blue-blur Sonic. But after that many have tried and many have failed...Sony first tried with that strange polygon head Enos (sic) and then almost had Crash Bandicoot but that didn't last and a change in developer may bring the marsupial into obscurity.  Microsofts first outing gives us Blinx, a time sweeping cat that is out to clean up time, using his trusty time sweeper he can control time and use it to defeat enemies and complete level objectives. With Artoon being the developer (former Sonic Team Members) a very unique and cool premise plus an awesome character design things are set for greatness. But a few minor flaws and some closed minded individuals keep this game from rising towards the top. Graphics: Everything works here, lighting textures, animation. The kooky world is set with odd building designs and bizarre creatures. Blinx looks and moves amazing with awesome facial expressions. Lighting is colorful and well placed.  Sound: Blinx does say much and the music isn't the worst or always the best. All the other sound effects work and fit in with the setting.  Control: Blinx handles marvelously jumping from ledge to ledge aiming at enemies traversing the terrain is all pretty simple and easy to do. The time controls are setup nice and wrap up Blinx control package nicely. But then there is the camera, the tight level design leaves the camera nowhere to go and the control range of movement they give for the camera isn't enough, not the worst camera in video game history but it can get in the way from time to time.  Gameplay: Its all about using your imagination and experimenting with the time controls. The unique concept for the game lends it way to very cool and original ways to find items, defeat enemies and complete levels. Some of these ideas could have been implemented better and the level designs are nice but the areas are sometimes a little to tight and narrow.  Replay: Tons of levels to explore and given the games premise you have to explore a level a couple times over making for a decently long platformer, but the ramping difficulty of later levels may turn may people away (not as frustrating as some Sunshine levels though). Tons of secrets and unlockable items (though some of the early secrets are rather bizarre and quite useless) still a lot to see and do here.  Overall: Like many games I play this is NOT for everyone but if you like having to really think your way through a game and are looking for something is unique, original and fun to play Blinx is definitely worth a look.	1
My first review, a preview, was right in many ways, and when I look back, I know why this game got so much hype...it's FUN!  Here are the basics of Blinx, and why u have to get it NOW! The basics:  You walk around collecting time crystals that match (4 yellow stars, 4 blue moons).  Collecting four of the same kind will give u that kind of time control power for up to 10 seconds (which is quite a lot in this game).  The controls are: rewind, fast forward, slow motion, pause, and record (which is really fun) in which your shadow does whatever u recorded.  Now, on each level, there are a certain amount of monsters (which are quite creative).  To destroy them, u have to collect trash lying on the street (suck it up in your timesweeper) and shoot it at them.  Once all the monsters are destroyed, u can leave the level.  You can return at any time, and in the midst of all this, you have to collect gold.  With the gold, u can buy upgrades of your cloths, shoes, jackets, time holders, and of course, your Timesweeper.  It is crucial to have the best timesweeper to find secrets.  You'll have to play to see what I mean. Replay Value: Tremendoes, as u can return to each level as many times as u want.  Each time is petty fun, too, because u have to find secrets crucial to beating the game (while controling time of course) and collect gold.  There are over 40 levels, labled first 1-1 to 1-3, then a boss.  Once u beat the boss, u move to levels 2-1 to 2-3.  Then beat that boss and then so on.  It goes on to level 10-3 then an extremely tough boss.  And no, this game is not too easy.  I've still only halfway beaten it, and the overall fun never wheres off.  This game, as u can imagine, has incredible replay value! Graphics: The best yet to be seen in many ways.  The water looks like clear, real, shimmering water.  The landscapes are huge, and every level is detailed down to the last ounce so that u feel like your in a living, breathing world!  You can actually see the very fur on Blinx's body, and his tail swishes around in a very cat like way.  Everything is beautiful in Blinx: The Timesweeper, and this game really showed (in my opinion) some of the true powers of the XBOX. Fun Factor: 5 stars!  The whole thing is fun as hech.  Whether it be controlling time, shooting monsters, to upgrading your weapons, this game has it all.  I've spent hours upon hours playing this awsome game, and I know I'll spend hours upon hours more continueing that trend. A u can clearly see, Blinx: The Timesweeper is a hit, and very innovative.  The power to control time is weaved in very well with the superb story, and the overall depth is there.  This is a Mario like game in many ways, and yet is more challenging and takes more thinking than that.  Blinx: The Timesweeper should be on your Christmas List this holiday season, and will bring joy, fun, and overall excitement to the whole family (plus their are 3 games files).  Enjoy!	1
Blinx: The Timesweeper is a fun and fairly well made platformer cast in the mold of some classic games but with a new twist: the ability to manipulate time.  I read a fair number of reviews on the internet before buying this game and a distressing number of bad reviews nearly dissuaded me from the purchase.  I'm quite glad though, that a few poisitve and insightful comments convinced me to take the plunge. Starting with the basics, Blinx is a three dimensional (actually four dimensional) platformer game.  That is to say, you control a character who has to move through large levels and leap about and stay alive while defeating a fairly large number of quirky enemies and rooting out hidden secrets.  For a plot you have your basic save the world, get the girl scenario.  The controls for Blinx are a little difficult to manipulate at first, not because the scheme is particularly complex, but because of the camera.  A faulty camera is the first pitfall in any three dimensional, third person game and the deisgners of Blinx, recognizing this, put the camera in your hands.  You choose the angle and can even go into an "over the ears" mode which lets you look around from a first person perspective.  The challenge in controlling Blinx is figuring out how to move while constantly manipulating the camera to your best advantage, as "forward" and "backward" and such change with the camera.  It can be a little disorienting at times, but that's just part of the game.  If you can get that skill down early, a lot of the tougher sequences in the game get a lot easier.  Ultimately, Blinx can move and look any which way, you've just got to learn how to make him do it and the challenge is subtle, especially in heated battles where you don't have time to choose your angles carefully. What makes Blinx special and different are the time manipulation features.  If you gather certain cmbinations of special "time crystals", you can alter the game with the stdandard VCR controls: pause, slow, rewind, fast forward, and record.  All the powers are cool and useful although they sometimes seem under-utilized, which is to say that there a lot of levels and enemies you can easily defeat without any of the time manipulations.  But they are still fun to use, with rewind, record, and pause seeming to be the most powerful.  Rewind is most often used to reconstruct crumbled or destroyed features of a level, pause is a useful combat trick to say the least, and record is a multipurpose tool, making you twice as deadly in combat or giving you a spare hand to open special, double triggered doors and such.  You can gather crystals by walking over them or by sucking them up with your vacuum cleaner.  Blinx is equipped with one heck of a vacuum cleaner and he uses it to suck up garbage to fire at his enemies. Graphically and musically speaking, Blinx is dripping with cuteness.  The graphics are amazing and the landscapes are trippy and highly detailed although there seem to be an awfully lage number of invisible walls keeping you out of some of the nooks and corners.  The music is your typical platformer fare, and would have gone perfectly with Sonic or Mario games of the past, although it is more techinically involved than some of those games' music and obviously beyond the capabilites of the older consoles we all played those games on. Blinx is a long game of standard levels punctuated by occasional boss levels that you move through in a linear fashion.  However, you can go back and replay old levels as many times as you wish in order to stockpile gold or to perfect your technique.  Indeed, you have to go back to some of the old levels once you have better equipment as some secrets are only accessible once you have used some of your cash to upgrade your vacuum cleaner.  Some objects are far too heavy and large for the sweeper you start with to handle. The most common complaints people have made about this game are about its camera, its difficulty, and its music and feel.  Most of these complaints are unwarranted.  The camera is challenging to learn to use, but once you do it is quite powerful and flexible.  Good games should be difficult.  An easy game you can pass in a few hours without dying or having to really think or explore new strategies is just a waste of time.  The difficult stages you encounter later in the game go a long way towards giving it that "old school" feel.  And finally, the game is supposed to be "cute".  If you don't think you can stomach that sort of Hello Kitty brand of cuteness, then Blinx, despite its excellent and innovative glameplay, is not the game for you. Overall, Blinx is an excellent game for both kids and adults.  It is fresh, challenging, and worth adding to the collection of any fan of platformers.	1
Okay this is going to be a long review but for anyone who is thinking of buying or renting Metroid Prime anytime soon I recommend reading this. First of all, some people are so stupid that what they think is not a 'good game' is one where you pointlessly run around killing things, with blood, and a variety of weapons to choose from. It may just be my opinion but personally i prefer a time consuming, puzzle game where you take time to solve mysterious puzzles and unlock new abilities than one where you get different guns and find different ways to kill people. I am not saying FPS gun games are bad, just sometimes pointless. Not all games are bad like that, actually very few are, but many peole try to overrule a good game (Metroid Prime) with a FPS such as HALO or whatever. Graphics: Incredible! These graphics are totally amazing, and i seriously mean it. A good game is a good combination of sound, gameplay, length, and graphics. This game exceeds in all of these categories. More importantly, the graphics are so detailed and complex that sometimes I like playing it just because of the graphics. Controls: From a previous N64 Zelda owner, these controls were a little hard to adapt too. But soon I realized that they were perfect, and they could not be changed to be better. Sometimes, because of the X and Y makes you fire a missile and turn into your morph ball, you will accidentally fire a missile when trying to play against the clock or put in your morph ball in the middle of a boss. This becomes rather annoying but if you play this game often, then you will no longer make this mistake. Gameplay and Replay Value: 5/5 The gameplay on this is seriously awesome. I am the type of person who goes through games quickly and was in need of a challenge. This game not only offers an amazing new way of playing the Metroid series (even though this is the first Metroid game I've played [lol]) but the gameplay is VERY addictive, hard and challenging. It is challenging in a way that you won't beat this game overnight or in a series of hours without a walkthrough. This is one of the best games with Gameplay that I have ever tried. What I REALLY like about this game is the lengthiness of it. I am a big fan of zelda games, and in ocarina of time 9 temples was good, but i wanted more. I assumed this game was not a very lengthy one because of the quality of it. Most games either have cheesy graphics and amazing gameplay or amazing graphics and poor gameplay. It seems like this game never ends. When it took me a long time to get 1 artifact and i realized there was TWELVE artifacts, I jumped with joy because the best thing about an addictive game is if it is a long game. I love the feel of getting a new beam or morph ball ability or suit or visor when i REALLY tried hard to solve a puzzle or beat a boss. Backtracking to find missile expansions and energy tanks is somewhat hard.. but surprisingly fun! Another thing i like about this game is that you see what you are going to get before you solve the encounter/puzzle. I run up in a deserted place to scan and find the morph ball. Then when i try to pick it up, it disappears (or something similar) and I turn around to face a huge hideous boss. It's the same thing with energy tanks and missile expansions. You can see them but not get to them. This motivates the gamer to find a way to get them by an alternate path or a new ability. Music and Sound: 5/5 The music and sound is incredible!! For the different stages, the music suits it perfectly and NEVER becomes annoying. The makers must have done a lot of work to create the precise tone, volume of the music for the different levels. Sometimes I even find myself humming the Magoor Tune while I am doing something without effort. Sometimes the music tenses up when there is a battle going on. When the battle is done, the music changes which helps you see that PHEW! theres no more bad guys in here. More importantly, the sound of firing your ice beam or an enemy exploding or getting hit out of the blue increases gameplay a LOT. The sound and music is what drives games, a game without sound is a game without fun. When I first tried the game, I found it great, but i didn't think it was going to be a long game. When I got to the Chozo Ruins and I went about an hour into the game, I noticed how complex and detailed the rooms, maps, abilities, etc. were and it was then I noticed that this is the PERFECT game for me. Lack of a Multi-player Option Dilema: This game does not have a multiplayer option, which in some ways makes it weak, but in other ways makes it stronger. For people who want to kick their friends butt in an awesome game they will be disappointed to see that they can't. However, if Metroid Prime had a multiplayer, the game creators would have to pour the game's resources into that and split up the capability. Also, it would be very hard to put a multi-player option in an amazing graphical game because when the screen is divived, it would mess up everything. And what would you do with a multi-player option anyway?? It would be a cheap version of a multi-player first person shooter with little to do. Nintendo obviously didn't add a multi-player function because not only does it bring down the game's quality, but it would be a COMPLETE waste of time and money. Overall: This game is definetly worth the money that it is selling for, (I live in Canada and it's 40 bucks). And if you are still not convinced that this isn't a good game, at least rent it, or play it at a friends house. Take a chance to see how it is... Unlike other reviewers, I am not trying to coax you to buy the game RIGHT away or NEVER buy it even if it was one cent. I'm not saying that I would give it ten stars or negative six, this is what the game deserves. I am showing you the capability of this game and how fun it was to me, and how fun it could be to you.	1
ok i admi it this game ROCKS!exelent graphics all is exelentbut is a little hard.buy this game.	1
Metroid Prime, which was part of Nintendo's Big 4, along with Super Mario Sunshine, Star Fox Adventures, and Zelda: Wind Waker, was one of the most anticipated games of the year.  Everyone knew that Samus was going first person, and wanted to see what the outcome will be.  Well, the title says it all basically, as this game is definetly one of the best on the Gamecube.  Why is it the best game on the Gamecube?  Well, let me dwelve into the game a bit. The graphics are far and away incredible.  Never before have I seen a game take advantage of the Gamecube's full graphical processing.  From the rain falling and running down your visor, to the blizzards and lava pools, the game's different intriguing environments are just great to look at.  Samus looks even better, her suit is incredibly detailed and makes you wish you could see her in 3rd person all the time.  The framerate has some issues at times in certain places, but that is easily ignorable. The audio section of the game is probably the low point, but it is excusable.  While there really isn't too much music to speak of except the occasional theme song when Samus gets out of the save pod, the game's sound effects is what makes this area shine.  The firing of the different types of weapons, wiping out an enemy, and the chilling scream when Samus is defeated, all add to the depth and emotion of the game.  Samus doesn't speak too much herself, but why would she, seeing as how she is the only human on the planet. Gameplay is where this game tops practically any other game in the action genre today. Basically you go through level to level completing objectives and trying to get a higher % on the game completed chart.  To raise your % you will need to collect data on environments and enemies, find power up suits, and locate different weapon add ons, among other things.  The only gripe some people have had is that you must backtrack in levels a lot.  While that is true, each level contains so much to do and so many secrets this will be easily ignorable.  Samus also has a variety of cool abilities, such as the morph ball where you can see Samus as a ball in 3rd person, to help get into small spaces.  Did I mention the boss battles rock too?  I could go on and on about the gameplay but I'm trying to keep it short here. To wrap it all up Metroid Prime is my favorite of all the metroids and I am really glad Nintendo took this approach.  Don't listen to the people on this site that said the game sucked, because it doesn't.  They are just mad they either don't have the game, or can't get past the first level.  Oh the ignorance...anyway pick this one up if you have a Gamecube or are just looking for one of the greatest action games out there.  Have Fun!!!	1
Gonna get my metroid on yea...roll under that wreckage, shoot that bad guy...jump that ledge, bomb that false wall....backtrack 5 miles, wait wait wait, what? Yea, you backtrack alot. If you guys have ever played winback, that game where the objective is to backtrack half the time, this game outdoes even winback. Ok so the game is basically a first person shooter. It is linear, There are seperate paths you can go, but you usually will have to stop shortly after because you need a special gizmo or gadget. You don't really need to scan that much to win, even though in the first level they make it seem like you will. Basically you shoot monsters, find things to make your suit do more, and fight bosses for those things, then backtrack. The game has alot of shooting, contrary to what other people say. You will shoot alot of monsters by rapidly clicking the powerbeam button. Eventually, I just started using missles, because every time you kill a guy he leaves something. Well, they don't always leave things, but usually they will leave a health up or missle up. I think it depends on what weapon you use to kill the actual monster. The pros of the game are the great environments. It isn't the same over and over again, actually the backtracking screws that up. You could of gone through tons of different environments, instead you backtrack between like 5 of them, mabye 6. Then there are the graphics, pretty good. The weapons are alright, I love just pounding guys with missles. The morph ball works well, you can use it whenever you want. Then there is the help system. Usually it tells you when there is a save system nearby, and your next objective. Most of the time I am not lost, but sometimes it tells me to go 5 miles to where I just came from and I feel like throwing the game in the garbage. However, the cons of the game greatly out-due all the good things. The control is weird at first, but once you master it, it becomes better. Still, there are points in the game when the control works against you. Say there is a monster shootiong at you from behind. You can't really turn around and keep moving left and right, so you usually will get shot a couple times. Cleared areas usually leave some really tough enemies, that gang up on you and you die. That's another problem, the monsters can be really tough. Usually you can't just shoot the monsters. Most of the time you will have to find a weakness or wait till it turns around and shoot it's back. The overall layout of the game is even worst. Boss, new item, backtrack. You will probably fight 20 bosses in the game. You can get a few energy cell boosters, and missle pack boosters. The only thing is, most of them require you to go out of your way for them. Backtracking isn't that big during the first hour or so of the game, but let me tell you something, it gets worse. You go to this iceworld to get a speed ball reward, then you go ALL THE WAY BACK to your ship. If you play the game and get to the speed ball part, you will know what I am talking about. Besides backtracking and such, the problem is death. Die, reload from last save point saved at. The one problem that could of been avoided easily. Say you get killed? Ok, you can't just continue from the beggining of that boss fight, you are going to have to reload. Say you fight some of the tough enemies, reload. Say you play for 2 hours to get a powerup then die, reload. I think you understand. In closing, the backtracking makes the game bad. The dieing makes the game bad. I wouldn't of minded a shorter game with no backtracking. I wouldn't have minded a retry system for bosses. But these problems overshadow all the good things in the game, and make it not worth playing. Sorry metroid, better luck next time. Overall--->2 Stars   n good	-1
For a while I only had the NES system.  But while i had it, the original metroid game wus my favorite game ever!  Then A while later i got gamecube.  And i just  recently rented Metroid Prime to see wut it wus like.  It is 1 of  the best games ever in nintendo history!  The only thing that kinda stinks about it is that u can't save right where u r.  Like if ur mom calls u and tells u that u have to stop playing, u can't just save it and turn it off.  U have 2 go 2 a certain place to save it.  Otherwise it is a really great game.  It is worth every penny.	1
Now as for Games.  Like most reviews said this is one of the best games out for gamecube. and they are right. It is one of the best. It took me about a half hour to get used to the controls. So far i logged 20 hours and i am at meta Ridley.  with 100% scan/item pickup. the game ending depends on your scan/item pickup not the time.  Great story line continuing from the original metroid.the controls are very responsive . Graphics are  at gamecubes best of its best. The sound is top Notch. The game isn't  wicked hard But it can be at sometimes. I definatly cant wait for Metroid prime 2 Controls 9-10 Gameplay 10-10 Replay Value 10-10 Sound 10-10	1
This Is One Of The BEST Games Ever Created And I Mean It. I Loved Metroid Fusion For The Game Boy Advance And Now Metroid Prime Is Even Better. What You Can Do Is Link Metroid Fusion To Metroid Prime Via A Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable Which Is Pretty Neat. I Have 5 Words GO GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!!	1
Metroid Prime was a great experience, especially after reading Orson Scott Card's "Xenoxide", sequel to "Speaker for the Dead", sequel to "Ender's Game".  "Xenocide" include genetic manipulation, big science words, and the survival of an entire race depending on the mutation of a deadly virus.   Metroid Prime looks a lot like how I pictured "Xenocide".  THe graphics are what did the trick.  These have to be the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen in a GameCube game.  Awesome.   The story is a bit bland, and it gets old simply searching for new weapons and artifiacts and the like.  Your adrenaline will pump in the beginning, but after a while the game is only exciting when you're fighting something big.   Mostly what you do is find a new weapon, use it to open a new area, fight a boss, get a new weapon, use it to open a new area, fight a boss, get a new weapon..... it just becomes old.   Combat in this game is thrilling.  The graphics help every step of the way.  But, because of the bland story, the combat starts to get old, too.   Maybe it's because I'm not much of an adventure game person, maybe it's because the Zelda series did a much better job in adding a good story to the whole "find-sometihng-new-to-move-on" idea, but I couldn't give Metroid Prime that fifth star.  The graphics are good, though.  Really good.	1
One of the best games ever made.  Beautiful environments, great control, deep story.  This game is nearly flawless.	1
Metroid Prime has, since the announcement that it would be first-person and in 3D, enjoyed the kind of controversial hype that only a first-party Nintendo game can enjoy. Once Nintendo announced that Retro Studios was going 3D with the title, it quickly joined the new Zelda in the "What are they thinking?" club. You (yes, you) most likely thought it would be ruined once it began to look more and more like a first-person shooter. You then read E3 impressions that said the game was good, but you probably didn't listen. Well, guess what, Mr. Smarty: Metroid Prime is good. Really good. While Prime's graphics lack a little polish and flair and the controls never really become second-nature, the game itself simply rules. If you're an old-school Metroid fanatic, you can skip the next paragraph or two as we explain the idea to the new folks. Metroid games have always been about exploration, secret areas, and collecting power-ups that are cleverly hidden in plain sight. You might see a door in the first room that you can't reach until much later in the game, and behind that door might lie an entire new set of rooms to discover. You'll do a lot of backtracking, but you'll do it with a purpose as you realize that the cliff that was too high to get to in the beginning is a piece of cake with your new Space Jump boots. Within a few structural limits, you have free reign of the place to come, see, and conquer as you will. As you play, the world unfolds before you, and you become the powerful warrior you need to be to end the threat that enfolds the world of Tallon IV. In the beginning, Metroid Prime suffers from its own expectations. Since it is a first-person game, you'll likely fumble around with the controls as you try to play the game like, say, TimeSplitters 2 or Halo. At some point, though, you'll realize that this is not Halo, and you'll adjust. When you do, you'll be surprised just how much like the old Metroids this game feels. You jump from platform to platform (always a pain in first-person games, but rather forgiving in Metroid), use your Ice Beam and Varia Suit, and fight the same enemies you remember from the older games in the series. Once you reach that point, you'll fall right back into the old Metroid groove, and it's all smooth sailing from there. There are a few minor problems with the game. First off, while the controls are great once you get used to them, the learning curve is pretty steep, and even once you know them pretty well, they never seem to feel natural. Ten hours into the game you'll still be accidentally firing missiles when you want to see the map, and the use of the triggers to look about and lock onto targets never feels completely right. Metroid's graphics are schizophrenic in a way; some minor details, like seeing Samus's eyes reflected in the visor in a bright glare, are spectacular, but others, like muddy shadows and simple enemies, are not. Lastly, Metroid Prime requires a lot of backtracking and going through places you've already seen, and that can get boring if you don't know where you're going. Hardcore Metroid players won't have a problem with that, but others might find it exhausting to keep revisiting the same old places over and over and over. Still, even with its minor problems, Samus's latest adventure is a perfect tribute to the Metroid we all know and love. Salute to Retro Studios and Nintendo for giving us the industry's Holy Grail-a next-gen game that significantly upgrades the genre while keeping all the classic feel of the original. Well done, folks, well done.	1
This game is very fun to play if u like shooting adventure games. Its one of the best. All the sweet weapons are there, so u won't miss a thing. The only draw back 4 me is the 1st person mode. I don't really like that but if u curl into a ball its 3rd person. (-: If u like this stuff buy it. (-:	1
I had Fusion (great game!) before I got this and thought how are they going to do this as a First Person Shooter. The only thing Fusion and Prime have in common is the main character. You don't hang from ledges or climb up walls in Prime like in Fusion. And you don't have the AWESOME targeting system in Fusion like in Prime. These are two completely differnt games. Even though they were released at the same time. Anyway the targeting system, if the enemy is within you're field of view you push a button and it autolocks on to the enemy. If there is more then one it locks on to the closest. As you kill each enemy the target lock moves to the next enemy. This also carries on the Metroid tradition of you could just run though the game and win, or you could explore find secret power-ups. If you have a Cube and want to see what it is capable of graphically get this game.	1
After enjoying my XBOX for a long time now, I thought I would never get another gaming system....until Metroid Prime was released.  I have always been a Metroid fan since the old 8-Bit NES version.  I have had every metroid eventhough I never could really get into the first Metroid that was introduced to the gameBoy.  Anyway, the only reason I got the gamecube was to play this game, and I haven't been dissapointed.  In fact metroid is still the only game I have for the GC. The first thing you will notice in this game is that the game has gone from a side scroller, to a 1st person 3d world in which your TV screen is Samus' visor.  That is the main thing you are going to have to get used to.  Because it is now a first person shooter, there are no more cool flips that Samus will do.  Other than that, I really like the switch. Graphics:  I was very surprised by this game's graphics on the GameCube, they are almost flawless.  Every detail was taken care of, look up into the rainy sky and you can actually see rain drops hit your visor (TV screen), come out of a deep river or lake, and you can see the water run off your visor.  All the boss enemies are original and not corny looking or cheap in their attacking methods (with the exception of one maybe), however some of them can still be difficult, but not frustratingly difficult. Sound:  The sound has been done very well in this game, but one thing I missed was the old background tunes from the NES version.  One tune did make its way over to the GC version, (duuuuu, daaaaaa dudududuuuuuuu, daaaaaaaaaa....etc), but other than that, the music is new.  The sound effects in this game have also been done very well, and again every detail seem to be taken care off. Gameplay:  The comntol in the game can be a bit cumbersome at first, mainly because of it being a 1st person game now.  You are no longer able to see every thing that is going on around you.  You can only see things happen directly infront of you and to your immediate left or right.  One thing that does help is the auto targeting feature.  This allows you to lock onto enemies and kill them without wasting precious time manually aiming your weapon.  As in all the other metroid games, you can find upgrades, bombs, super bombs, missles, energy tanks, different beams etc.  My favorite thing about these new upgrades are the different visors, for example, there is a thermal visor you can switch to which allows you to see enemies in a dark room.  One more thing I have to mention is that yes, Samus can still change into a ball.  When doing this, the screen actually zooms out so you can see the ball completely while she is rolling through tunnels and narrow passage ways.  Nintendo did a very good job on this. Overall:  I have been impressed with the game overall, the only reason I could give it five stars is because there are certain areas of your mission which can become very tedious and in some cases painfully boring.  However the rest of the game makes up for this few bad spots in the game.  I was very impressed that Nintendo had the insight that changing a side scroller to a 1st person shooter required more than just changing the view, they also changed the actual gameplay to play like a 1st person.  Eventhough you can't see behind you, the gameplay is designed in such a way that this will not cause much of a problem. I just recently purchased a new Sony 53 inch HDTV so I will be playing this game AGAIN from start to finish to get the full effect of this game.	1
For those who loved the classic NES Metroid and it's superior SNES version, you are in for an unconventional, but pleasant, surprise. Metroid Prime takes place after the events of the NES Metroid game with famed bounty hunter Samus Aran tracking pirate activities on the planet Talon IV, which neighbors Zebes.  After discovering that the planet has become a base of operations for the pirates, Samus descends planetside to have a look around.  She discovers the pirates and their plans, as well as ancient secrets of the Chozo, and a horde of severely mutated creatures, including the dreaded Metroids. The sheer variety of things to do would be enough to keep you coming back, but Retro Studios has made the action so enjoyable and the graphics so lush, that the game draws you in quickly and completely.	1
Maybe it's just me, but I like the camera angle behind the character. It takes a while to learn to jump over things when you can't see your feet and know when exactly to jump. A look up/look down feature would be nice.	1
I've got a big review for this game, and a website([...] a beautiful game that really deserved the Game of the Year award on so many websites like IGN.com. Best of all FPS/Adventure games out there, and it will make you want to play it again and again. Better than Halo. It will sastify all Metroid fans and FPS fans. It's worth the wait,for Metroid Fans. It's a must buy for all Cube owners.    Graphics: 6/5  The most beautiful, pretty and detailed breathtaking scenery and graphics I've ever seen in by Videogame years. Rocks, mountains, plants environments, snow are so well done to perfection. Snowfall drop from the bright white sky of Tallon IV. Best graphics for the gamecube. The frames run not a 30 frames, but 60 frames per second. There are hardly any slow downs in this wonderful game, even in the ferocious battle sequences. Retro studios has really done a brilliant job for the quality of this game.   Gameplay: 5/5 Very good gameplay. You can play this for countless hours of fun! This game takes Metroid to new heights if excitement. It turns a 2D side scroller to a 3d non stop action adventure game! There many bosses, including Flaagra, the Metroid Prime, Sheegoth, etc. This will be the most fun experience ever for you. My most favorite boss is Meta Ridley, with heart pumping explosions and fire everywhere. He drops dozen of bombs everywhere as you battle this ferocious flying monster. Pendrana drifts is so beautiful, with snow so white and detailed.  The space pirates are not that retarded and are very cool. They battle you laser blasters, firing rapidly. They are really fun to fight with. The pirates with the jet packs are the best. They have homing rockets and lasers, and you blow them away with super missiles. They come turling down and exploding to a oblivion.  Very realistic game, with rain drops that flow on your visor. Or when you shoot a parasite up close, the guts BLAST on to your screen. What's cool, is that everytime there is a brightexplosion,Samus's eyes REFLECT of her visor, and you can see it. Also, when you fire really rapdily and fast for about a couple seconds, you'll see your gun flaming hot.   There are many types of cool weapons. Missiles, super missiles, bombs, ice beam, plasma beam,wave buster, ice missile charge shots Etc. There are endless amounts of weapons in this game.   There are many items in this game. The visors include the combat visor (Standard visor), scan visor (to scan for info about stuff or to open special things), Thermal visor (see in the dark through heat vision) and X ray visor (see through secret walls).   There are many courses and areas in this game. Each level is immensely large and you can explore all over them, with challenges and obstacles.  Sound: 4.5/5 Very well done. You can hear the loud roars of monsters and creatures like the Space Pirates. The gun makes a loud bang sound, or icy blast from the ice beam. Other sounds include creature sounds, explosions, gunfire and machinery.  Value: 5/5 the wonderfulness of this game will keep players playing the game again and again. You can unlock special endings depending on what you got as a completion rate. You can also unlock image galleries and hard mode.    Overall: 5/5 Best of all games out there. You'll never regret buying this smash hit and videogame history maker. It's got all the stuff you need for the perfect game. It's a must buy for all Cube owners, and a MUST BUY for all Metroid Fans. What else game can compare to 2002's E3's best video game and the Game of the year for 2002?	1
Well, the title pretty much says it all.  Nintendo's fans (and even some fans of those "other" video gaming consoles) have waited 8 long years for the next installment of the Metroid series, having been tantalized in 1995 with the stunning (for the time) graphics and gameplay of Super Metroid on the 16-bit SNES console.  Nintendo picked Retro Studios to produce the next installment in the series, which -- in a move that surprised many longtime fans -- was to be completely 3D, and played from a first-person perspective.  What was this?  Heresy!  A Metroid game not in 2D?  How could they do it? Very carefully. Someone at Nintendo had clearly read the writing on the wall, as Metroid Prime is probably the best game on the 'Cube right now, and also one of the best games on *any* next-gen system.  It's that good.  The gameplay, graphics, and, well, *everything* have been polished to a mirror sheen by the fine folks at Retro (literally; one of the cooler visual effects in the game causes your character's face to reflect on the visor in front of you when bright explosions go off nearby).  The game moves slowly at first, as you explore a recently abandoned research frigate, but eventually picks up steam, and becomes downright frantic near the end, as you face several long, difficult stretches filled with enemies, and a series of climactic boss fights.  However, the level of difficulty remains fairly low, as long as you devote some time to exploring the game world and searching out energy tanks and missile expansions.  Also, the difficulty in the boss fights comes mostly from discovering the particular tricks you should use to fight them, not from the actual gameplay. There are only a few minor points on which Metroid Prime can be faulted. First, this style of game is not for everyone.  Despite initial appearances, this is *not* a traditional First-Person Shooter game (a la DOOM, Quake, or Halo).  The pacing is (deliberately) slower, the combat more strategic and less about pointing the biggest gun you can find at the enemies and holding down the trigger.  Most of your time is spent exploring the nooks and crannies of Tallon IV, discovering hidden powerups and new abilities, and gradually uncovering the plot of the game (done, IMO very tastefully, by reading computer data logs and messages left inscribed on various archeological ruins scattered around the planet). Second, the controls will throw off some players who are used to "standard" console FPS controls (ie, using one stick to move and strafe, and another to control your viewpoint).  Metroid Prime reverts to the "Goldeneye" system where the left analog stick controls turning and forward/reverse movement, and you have to hold the R trigger to look up or down.  Aiming is taken care of by an auto-lock system (similar to that in the N64/GCN Zelda games), but some will find the control scheme limiting.  I think it fits the game perfectly. Finally, there are a few actual bugs in the game, one of which can cause it to occasionally crash (however, the general abundance of save points makes this less heinous, as long as you save often), and another which can make it impossible to complete the game (though only if you fail to pick up a key item when it is *very* clearly presented to you after defeating one of the later bosses). Seriously, if I could give the game 6/5 stars, I probably would.  It's that good.  If you own a cube, buy it.  If you don't own a cube, get one while you can still get MP bundled with it for free.	1
Without hesitation, I'll openly admit that Metroid Prime was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Nintendo's promotion which promised a copy of Prime free, alongside the purchase of a GameCube, is without question the reason I'm the proud owner of a GCN today. To my eyes, it was to Nintendo what Halo was to Microsoft. Justification. One title that looked like an absolute "can't miss." For the most part, Prime performed exactly like Halo; it delivered in grand, Earth-shaking fashion. But then it hit a couple snags.  From the moment you press that "power" button on the system's roof, there's no doubt that this baby has been polished to a gleam. Everything from the opening sound effects to the theme song to the incredible background footage that enhances the options screen is flawless. The in-game HUD is simple, yet effective, the options and status screens easy to navigate. Five minutes into the action, you'll be expertly navigating the most complex screens without so much as a second thought.  The attention to detail in Prime is off the charts. This is more than just a three dimensional first person shooter. It's an entire WORLD, with every single possibility accounted for. Moss grows in humid areas. If an errant missile explodes at the right angle, you'll catch a glimpse of Samus's face, reflected in the glass of her visor. Wander too close to a cloud of steam, and the visor will fog up for a few seconds. Quality control was all over this game, and it really shows.  Ditto for the visuals. The new title is everything I imagined  it might be, and more. This is Metroid fully realized in three dimensions, to stunning result. Classic series enemies such as the Space Pirates and the Metroids themselves coexist side by side with new creatures perfectly suited for the same atmosphere.  It's like every new title in the classic series peels away a new layer of  the ecosystem. The new animals match the old flawlessly. The terrains, the vehicles, the weapons, the mazes... everything is simply stunning, to the point where I'd say it's among the top three or four games, visually, of all time. I'd rank it just above Halo in terms of breathtaking, heart-stopping beauty. That's right, the GameCube outguns the Xbox in this fight.  If the visuals of Metroid Prime are a sheer work of art, the audio is in a league of its own. There's really nothing in the world that can serve to pull an entire package together as tightly as a perfectly placed tune. It's in this area, which Metroid makes its greatest impression. The music, occasionally a touch repetitive, is thoroughly compelling and, at times, an enormous chunk of icing on an already delicious cake. While the hours you'll spend underwater are truly a sight to behold on their own, they become absolutely awe-inspiring when paired with the perfect, slow, ambient melody chosen as their accompaniment. There's a true story of techno meets industrial meets trance hidden within the soundtrack of Metroid Prime, one with which you'll never grow tired.  It's when I get to gameplay that Prime takes its first missteps. While one might suspect the title would control very similarly to Halo, Unreal Tournament or Quake III (where one stick controls movement and the other aims), Metroid instead took a small step backwards, to a control scheme reminiscent of Doom and Wolfenstein 3-D. The left stick moves the player forward and backward, and turns the screen left or right. Players can strafe by holding down the L button and pressing left or right, and may look up or down by holding the R button and maneuvering the control stick in any direction.  Each of the game's four weapons are required to open certain doors around the world, and serve as an indicator of where exactly you should be at any moment in time. Unfortunately, doors don't always open on the first shot. Or the second. Or, occasionally, the tenth or eleventh. I've literally stood in front of a door, constantly firing, for over a minute while I waited for the thing to "sense" my gunfire. While that's a minor annoyance, exploring a remote area, it's more than a little frustrating when running from an angry pack of bloodthirsty enemies.  Perhaps the coolest thing about Prime is the implementation of the morph ball. The moment you press X, the screen shifts from first person mode to third person, and the game transforms from a first person shooter to a 3-D puzzle game. Surprisingly enough, the two genres merge flawlessly and act as an enjoyable change of pace from one another.  I enjoyed the storyline, despite being confused on more than one occasion, and was kept enthralled until the final battle, completely expecting the closing sequence to blow me away. Well, it didn't quite turn out that way. My fifteen hours of game time were capped off by one of the most disappointing endings I've ever witnessed. No joke, the credits rolled for THREE TIMES AS LONG as the closing cinema. Then Metroid proudly announced that I'd unlocked "Hard Mode."  Despite my qualms and my intense irritation over the unacceptable closing sequence, Metroid Prime remains a very solid game, spanning two very notable genres with impressive results. The visuals and sounds are setting a new standard for the industry, and the game is a tremendous rush to play. The sense of exploration and discovery has carried over flawlessly in the transition from side-scrolling platformer to three dimensional FPS. It loses points for its lack of multiplayer functionality, in addition to a few questionable choices in the control scheme, the horrendous let down after the final boss and that nasty bug involving the doorways. Still, make no mistake, this is an unbelievable title. It's worth every bit of the forty dollars the big "N" is still asking for it. Just don't go in expecting a big payoff for all your work, as I did.	1
I'm a little odd in my tastes in video games and to tell you the truth I was never a fan of the metroid games before this one. I maybe rented them all but I remember total fustration and pointless button pressing throughout alot of the games. This is a totally fresh new look towards Metroid for any video game player mainly because the game screams the state of the art beauty that is currently integrated in our video game system. The game runs really fast on the game cube. It is a first person shooter but you can morph into a ball known as the morph-ball and sneak into little cracks and enter places you could not normally standing up. The world that Samus (your character) is in is very big and very very complex meaning that the map system is one of the best you will ever see in a video game and the secrets and tasks you must accomplish and unlock throughout all the levels from beginning to end are countless. The one bad thing about this game is the controls and to tell you the truth if you have a game cube system than you will understand what I mean when I say the L and R buttons are two loud clicking hard to press buttons that you have to rely on to lock and shoot perfectly and pace all at the same time....wooo! It's too confusing to explain but the game is cool and worth a look!	1
Well, I was waiting for this game a long time ago, and I got it for Christmas, and I just recently beat it.  It was/is the best game for GCN that I have, and I was very impressed.  The first level is more of an introduction, being very easy.  BUt then, Chozo Ruins (#2), gets more difficult, which I quite enjoyed. The graphics are just absoluely amazing, best graphics on a game for GCN by far, the detail put into the game, it's just unbelievable, everything has its own little testure, and nothing is bland at all. The controls are also very superior and easy to pick up.  Newer players may have a few problems with the C-Stick to change weapons and the control pad for visors, but you catch on very quickly.  It is also very easy to lock on and strafe, as well. The one flaw of this game is that it is just too short.  Older N64 games were huge epic adventures (Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Mario 64), but this game just didn't last long enough being the great that it was.  However, I do like that once you finish a level, you aren't completely done with it, and each level has its own organized structure, which is very nice. Overall, this game is one of the best games I have played, and it would be #1 if it had been longer, but each boss provides an interesting challenge (especially the last few), yet none are too hard (except maybe one), and there no level in which you can just blow by, either.  So thats why I give this game a... A (9.3/10)	1
Let me starts by saying that I never owned or played the orignal NES Metroid.  My first exposure to the franchise came with it's SNES version Super Metroid.  That was enough to hook me for life.  One thing can be said in favor of Nintendo: their franshise game series rank among the best for any game system.  Metroid Prime is no exception. I was a bit skeptical of the change in format from 2D platform to 3D shooter, but having played it (sometimes for hours on end), I must say that it's a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable game.  In my opinion, it's possibly the best 1P perspective game available on any system (sorry to all those HALO fans who may disagree, but that game didn't impress me much). First of all, the visual detail of this game is nothing short of remarkable.  The environmental effects on the visor are splendid, and the switch from 1P to 3P when using the morph ball adds a bit of variety to what has always been (to me, at least) a very tedious viewing type.  All the differnt environments on the planet are beautifully created, and the music, while not memorable, does add well to the aura of the game. The controls take some getting used to, especially switching visors with the control pad.  Otherwise, no major complaints in that department.  What I really enjoy is the weaponry.  The addition of multiple view visors was a great touch.  Some favorites have returned, along with a few new, and impressive, additions.  One things I didn't like about the SNES version is that once you found all the weapon enhancements, you could leave them all on and play without having to think about which one works better fo which enemy.  Not true with Prime.  For instance, the Ice Beam (now a separate weapon instead of an enhancement) is effective on some enemies, while useless on others.  Some enemies change color, which corresponds to the weapon needed to defeat them.  Also, some enemies are invisible to the regular view, which forces you to fight with an alternate visor enabled (Thermal or X-Ray).  The addition of power combo weapons is also a definite plus. I would have to say that this game is a definite candidate for a game of the year award, and it continues the Metroid franchise nicely.  5 Stars...at least until the next Metroid game comes out. ;-)	1
While the game starts out with a bang, it gets kind of boring and repeditive in the middle, but like all Metroid games, everything always explodes near the end, and that's what gamers always anticipate.  Perhaps it's not the abseloute greatest game ever made, but it's still a good game that every GameCube owner should take for a spin at least once.	1
One word can basically sum up the effect of Metroid Prime on players-wow!! The environments, sound, graphics, gameplay, everything draws you into the wonderful world of Metroid Prime. And basically, Metroid is prime! The game is almost perfect. The graphics are gorgeous, and the world of Tallon IV draws you in from every corner. It's a world screaming to be explored. The effects of Samus' power suit are amazing, and the effects from inside the helmet are terrific! Moisture builds up from inside, water drips off of the front, sludge covers the helmet. It's gorgeous! The gameplay is very smooth, and while the game is long, it progresses very quickly. Sure, there'll be a few times that you have to retry, but the game hardly ever slows down. Exploring is encouraged, and the enemies are in all of the right places, providing the right amount of action and the right time in the game! The sound is good, with the music being top-notch and the sound FX being superb! Everything flows great in MP! The only complaint that I have heard is how awful the controls are. This is partially true, and partially understated. The controls are a bit rocky for the first hour or so, but then tthey are pretty comfortable, or at least I thought so. The controls look back at first when flipping through the manual, but sooner or later the even out for an enjoyable gaming experience! Is Metroid Prime fun? This is the big question on everybody's mind before buying the game. I can answer that-yes, Metroid Prime is the most fun that you will get out of gaming this year! The environments are awesome, the levels are fun, the action never slows down, and Metroid never looked better in 3D! I would rate this game to any Gamecube owner who loves classic games from Nintendo. My rating-9.8!	1
Metroid Prime is very different from the normal Metroid series in that it's first player. Now, don't get me wrong, it is NOT a shooter. It's a first person action game. What's the difference? Well..a shooter you go around killing everything you see. Metroid Prime has the aspects of..totally non-linear, you can go anywhere..you have all of her powers.the roller ball, different suits, different weapons, different visors...and you have to adjust to the different envorionments to use them. It makes you think sometimes instead of just "Kill kill kill" which is one of the greatest aspsects. On a lesser note, the graphics are so awesome. They've put so much detail in this that rain gets on your visor when it rains if you're out in the open and it bounces off your gun, underwater, if something explodes you can see your face in the reflection of your visor and Samus looks toward the explosion. It's so detailed, I can't begin to explain. The game is challenging, but what's the point of a game if you can beat it in a day, right? So my recommendation is to buy it. If you're so skeptical as to buy it, then rent it and see how you like it. In my opinion, it's one of the best Gamecube games there are.	1
Samus Aran's return on the GameCube marks one of the system's best titles to date.  Don't let the game's first person shooter look fool you; Metroid Prime falls in to a category of its own.  The graphics, depth, and gameplay of this monstrosity are top notch.  However, it falls just slightly short of being a perfect game due to a few minor flaws... 1.) Most players will at first find the controls to be somewhat akward, especially if they haven't played a first person title on a console system before.  The controls will quickly become second nature, though, with only one aspect remaining a small problem: the visor and weapon switching.  Switching between the various visors and beam weapons in the game is simple under normal circumstances, but becomes very difficult and sometimes deadly in the heat of battle.  Unfortunately, the position of the switching controls does not lend itself to the split second visor/weapon switching that is sometimes required when fighting certain enemies.  This is only a minor flaw, though, because players can be easily get around it by taking cover to switch visors/weapons. 2.) Another thing some players may not like is the amount of backtracking that must be done in the game.  To get to new items or areas, players must often trek over vast terrains that they have already been to one or more times before.  This aspect of the game can occasionally upset its pace.  However, some areas are populated with new, harder enemies to keep things fresh the second time around. 3.) Metroid Prime is a vast adventure, but lacks a solid story to back it up.  This can be a good or bad thing for a player, depending on how they look at it.  On one side, the lack of an in depth story can make the game less interesting, since there is very little to tie its events together.  On the other side, the game becomes more action packed and intense when there isn't a story to slow it down. In all, Metroid Prime is an excellent game and Samus Aran's best adventure by far.  It has a few flaws, but they can be very easily looked over or dealt with.  If you absolutely must have a flawless, perfect game, then this title is not for you.  However, if you're looking for captivating gameplay, beautiful environments, and hours of fun, then don't hesitate to pick up Metroid Prime today!	1
Wow, talk about a game that will grab you.  Is it a "true" Metroid game?  Does it satisfy the Metroid fans or do justice to the title Metroid?  Who cares, that game rocked!  If it was called Adventures of Jane Doe, it would have still rocked with the only complaint being the games title at that point.  I'll review 4 topics: First Person; Controls; Loading Explanation; Graphics. Genre: Puzzle/Action.  First Person minus the FPS twitchy requirement. Graphics: Stunning Gameplay: Curious at first, but you'll soon understand why they did it like that. Challenge: High, depending on you of course.  Many rooms require repeat visits. -FIRST PERSON VIEW-  Alright, first to get it out of the way.  The First person point of view was a good move.  Nintnedo was not focusing on detailed motion of Samus but rather the interaction with the environment.  Though it is first person, there is a Lock-on targeting system and Samus will even lead moving targets.  So there isn't a combat/fighting reason for there to be easily accessible head motions.  And as before, in other Metroids, Samus usually had to be standing still to aim in different directions, so why change that all of a sudden.  The one First person element that I would have loved to see is a Side step that was independent of the turning and such.  But that isn't completely necessary. -CONTROLS-  Alright, so this game packs in every element from the original games and so much more.  The prelude to the game is a wonderful introduction to the controls.  You get used to them pretty quickly.  The newest and most imediately obvious addition is the Detection Visor, which allows you to activate switches, read terminal screens, scan enemies and objects and identify areas.  That'll be used throughout the game.  Now some people would have liked to see the C-stick used to work Samus's head, her view.  But Nintendo instead has it to select the weapons, and co-actively the directional pad selects visors.  I find myself swtiching between weapons all the time, quickly and in the heat of battle.  There are certain enemies in the second half of the game that are only vulnerable to one particular beam weapon... when you have one of each attacking you it's nice to be able to quickly switch to another weapon to hit one of them, missile it, and switch again to attack another.  In short, the controls and gameplay are set up to have every part of Samus's arsenal and abilities a button away, instead of some submenu.  In the Prelude you'll get to experience the controls of some of the cool features, such as the grapple and the morphball... the charge beam and such... but a horrilbe explosion causes a malfunction in all of the powersuits abilities except the beam weapon... so you start the beginning of the game like you do the other metroids... with a blaster. -LOADING TIMES-  Now some people have talked about the loading times for the game.  True, there is probably only a few places where "loading" is evident.  One of these is the beginning of the game or when you start from a savepoint, the 5 seconds of "Chozo Ruins" on the screen and then there's the animation sequence for the elevators.  But you'll also notice that some doors open quicker than others and some doors take a second or two to open, that becuase the map on the other side is currently loading.  The problem with this is that you can still move around, explore and do what-not while the map is loading.  The larger problem with this is that once i fell into the lava, which will quickly drain your energy, i was goofing off to begin with, my fault, i ran by an enemy and triggered the door to open (shooting it)... well the enemy managed to kill me while i was waiting for the door to open... so making a quick escape in this game depends on the size of the room your trying to escape to.  The game is good enough to load the maps in a "subconscious" method which means you never see a "loading" screen for the next map.  But then, as describe above, that active time while you wait for the door to open can hurt you sometimes. -GRAPHICS-  Amazing!  The graphics are absolutely amazing.  They have that real look about them and then that surreal look.  One of the coolest parts as far as graphics are concerned is the way that the weapons effect the visual environment... like firing a lot will cause the barrel to give off some heat, which you can see.  Certain weapons will distort the field of vision.  And probably the coolest thing I've seen is Samu's reflection in the visor.  If attacked with something that is bright, like a missile esplosion, you can see Samus's face reflected in the visor and depending on the brightness the more of her face you can see. Well there you have it.  I recommend this game but DO NOT expect it to be a "first person" game despite the first person view.  Good luck and Happy Hunting!	1
You can't say that any other game plays like this but Metroid, and that could be the finest testament to this game's faithfulness to its roots.  Where else is the whole world one big "level," that you don't just play through or beat but EXPLORE?  Where else do you adventure solo like this on an alien world, relying on your own abilities to interpret and solve problems?  Where else do you get the intangible joy of facing an insurmountable puzzle, only to leave it and come back to it later, properly equipped to solve it?  No where my friends, and that such a unique experience can be so masterfully created and sold as a mainstream title only attests to the quality of the work Nintendo and Retro have done.  It's all the same, yet it's new, fresh, and innovative.  It's the proper evolution of classic gaming, and is already a classic in its own right.  Saying that, I will leave you with a question: Have you ever put down the forays into 3D that were Mario 64 and Orcarnia of Time?  If your answer is no, and it almost certainly is, then I strongly encourage you take another look at this modern gaming gem.	1
I'll not spend a tremendous amount of time rehashing what has already been said about this tremendous, innovative game. Suffice it to say that despite its shortcomings the game is engaging on multiple levels. I just can't give the game five stars because of those previously-mentioned shortcomings. The backtracking necessary in the game seems superfluous and created only to extend the length of the game. Running back and forth between levels is just not my idea of a good time. An earlier reviewer also commented on a player's inability to save at any time. Again, this seems like an artificial impediment to extend the length of the game. I don't really see why the designers went to such great lengths to extend the gameplay time when clearly the game has plenty to offer without these "enhancements."  Additionally, while the game has a minimal storyline, it really doesn't contribute anythign to the overall experience of the game. Before I'm bashed over the head by Metroid fans, let me acknowledge that I'm a fan of the series and of this game as well. To me it seems worthwhile to acknowledge the flaws of the game in the hopes that the designers make real improvements when it comes time for Metroid Prime II.	1

Due to the fact that I am sick while writing this it is not going to be long. Ever since Metroid for the NES I have been a dedicated fan of the Metroid games. But this one is the best out of all of them. Just a little ahead of Super Metroid. You should buy this game. Seriously. The graphics are better than Halos, the fun factor is also better. But the controls are what most people say they have issues with, but I got them down solid before the game came out with that 10 minuete demo time you get. But you should buy this and get Metroid Fusion. Both the games are phenominal. See ya!   - The sick kid	1
Although I prefer Samus in her 2 dimensional form like on NES,SNES and Game Boy Advance I have to say this visually Perfect Dark esque game really packs in a mean punch and kicks some major alien a$$. All the graphics are awesome the challenges hard but still enjoyable  and the  soundtrack is pulsating. I still prefer 2D Samus like in Super Smash Bros Melee and all those 2D Metroids.	1
Samus is back, and badder than ever. The graphics, game play, incredible sound and big bad baddies make this worth buying, makes it worth buying a GameCube if you don't already have one. Upgrade your suit, find the Thermal Vision and X-ray Vision visors, get the Ice Beam, Plasma Beam and wreck some $H!T up! I can't say enough about the sound and the graphics (especially with the thermal visor, it like Predator vision).	1
I wanted to give a little bit of a alternate viewpoint on this game - I was anxious to get this game due to all the glowing reviews of it.  I have not played any of the prior Metroid games so I came at this one with a clean slate.  But I'm just not finding this game fun.  Maybe I'm just not the kind of guy that enjoys walking around in a robot suit, I don't know. The controls are not natural to me.  As you play, you switch visors which changes what the controls do.  With the scanning visor, the center of your view will allow you to lock on to an item and it will tell you what it is.  But sometimes you have to hold R, then look around, then press L (while holding R and moving the stick) to find out what something is.  The combat visor is similar, you can lock on to shoot with L, but sometimes it won't work so you have to hold R and use the stick to look around, then hit L, then fire.  Then sometimes you hold L to lock on, then move the stick while hitting B to dash around, and sometimes you hold L then move around in a circle while jumping, and.... I could go on here but I think you get the idea. I find it difficult to figure out what I'm supposed to do.  On the first boss, after you kill it you have some amount of time to get out before the deck explodes only it took me forever to figure out that you have to scramble up the rubble to exit.  It was difficult to see that the environment had changed. Sometimes you have to traverse levels many times running from point A to point B to get something you need to open the door at point A.  Or you get to the end not collecting what you need and find yourself combing back through the level to figure out what you missed.  Or you see something you want but can't get it because you don't have the right weapon or ball yet - you just know you have to come back for it.  Instead of feeling adventurous it comes off as repetitive to me. I am somewhat sensitive to motion sickness and find that this is one of those games that does it to me.  It is funny how I can play Quake III without getting queasy but this game definitely does it to me.  So beware if you are sensitive to stuff like that. On the plus side the graphics are really spectacular, and once the game begins there are no noticeable pauses for load times which is great.  The map is well done and helpful.  And playing as the ball is great-the game moves fast and  the perspective switches to the 3rd person.  I wish there was more of this to be done.	-1
I bought this game as part of a package deal when I bought my Gamecube from Amazon.  In all honesty, I didn't even really want the game, but figured I'd buy the package and sell the game as soon as I got it. Luckily, I decided to go ahead and give it a try.  While it starts out looking like a fairly lame space game, it evolves into a full-fledged masterpiece.  The graphics and gameplay are astonishing for someone who started out his video gaming with the likes of Pong and Space Invaders. That said, the only DOWNSIDE to the game is that there's really no way I could have gotten through it without the help of a guide.  Since Zelda: Ocarina of Time, (and probably before) it seems like designers are creating games to be so difficult that you need to fork over some extra cash to learn how to play them.  This seems like a cheap trick to make a few extra bucks on what should be a complete game at the time of purchase.  I really don't think there's any way you could find and do everything you need to in this game without some outside help, which is frustrating. At any rate, need for guides aside, this is a great game, and has become an unexpected favorite.  One for the permanent collection..	1
I'll admit, just like everyone else when Metroid Prime was announced to be a 3d FPS I gave up hope. I thought it would obviously be the biggest mistake in the Metroid series. As the game progressed and the screenshots started coming out though, I became curious. And now that I've played through the game, I can say for sure: It is the best Metroid game to date. Bar none. Prime is not actually a FPS, despite how it looks. It's not Halo, it's not even Half Life style. It shares more with Zelda 64, in fact. What I mean is that most all fighting is done via a lock on system. The game is far more based on adventure, strategy, and tactics. It's not based at all on aim, and very little on reflexes. It feels exactly like the Metroid series should. The 3d world feels completely natural. You'll spend a good deal of time doing jumps from ledge to ledge like before, but it's done perfectly in 3d. You'll never have to blindly leap, your view follows the leap perfectly. The graphics are incredible, the best on the Gamecube to date. You might not be too impressed on the first level, but as you play through the game you'll see just why the graphics are so groundbreaking. It's hard not to be amazed when you jump out of a lake and water streams down the front of Samus's visor. The first time you try the Thermal visor or the X-ray visor, you'll be thrown for a loop. It's simply stunning. The bosses are incredible looking, and the game never skips a beat. Loading is done seamlessly as you move through the map, so you'll never see a loading bar even once. The sound is incredible as well, you'll always be able to hear the enemies and the explosions without effort. The music fits the mood perfectly and never feels out of place. It's a perfect mix of old and new, sure to please any fan. It's amazing, but playing the game you actually truly do feel like Samus Aran. When playing most FPS style games, you don't actually feel anything like the character you're suppose to be. Just a hand and a gun. But as I said, this isn't a FPS. Every single piece of your view is designed to be exactly what Samus Aran sees. From the HUD on her Visor to the amazing way effects like rain splats on the helmet, you are in the power suit. You'll never question it, and nothing is ever out of place. Samus never talks in the game, but you'll never question it's her. The game's best power ups are still in there, new and improved, along with several all new enhancements. Now instead of the freeze beam or pulse beam taking over your gun, you'll always be able to switch between each gun with the click of a key. You'll have to use every weapon in your inventory to take on the game's enemies through the multiple and ever changing environments. Each gun interacts with the world exactly as it should... the freeze gun freezes, the pulse gun will drive electronics into a frenzy, the plasma gun melts and sets aflame whatever you blast in an instant. It's truly amazing. You always have a 3d map available to help guide you through the world. And believe me, you'll need it. Without the map this game would have been a dull boring maze. With this map, getting from point A to point B across several environments is a breeze. You'll constant have at least a good idea of where to go, as hints will appear on your map telling you to investigate energy spikes, unusual activity, and the like. The game's story isn't the most detailed or anything, but it's very entertaining and will keep you hoping for more bits and pieces at every turn. The story reveals the mystery of the planet, the strange space craft and bodies you find at the very start of the game, as well as the past of Samus Aran herself. You'll know more than ever before by the end of this game, and will look back on the older games with new understanding. The storyline fits perfect with the rest of the series and doesn't feel out of place in the slightest. Samus has some new abilities that both help the story along, and make perfect sense for a bounty hunter of her skill and experience. Using your visor, you can scan computers or other electronics and the power suit will hack any security in no time flat. This is used for everything from opening force fields, and shutting down turret guns. Best of all is hacking computers to read messages and files and figure out what the heck is going on. The visor scans other items in the same fashion. It will translate carvings in walls, scan weaknesses in structures, scan enemies for weaknesses, and just about anything else you come across. All in all, this game in unmatched on the Gamecube. It's by far the best Gamecube game today, and the best Metroid game to date. That may be hard to swallow, but try it and see for yourself. You'll be amazed. The game is roughly 20 some game hours, which translates into 30 some real world hours. A dedicated player can beat it in a week, but a casual gamer could play for a month. If you replayed the old Metroids, you'll probably replay this. If not, you probably won't reply this one either. But either way you'll have one amazing trip from the title screen to the ending sequence. - Rirath_com	1
I rented this game from blockbuster. Then I started to play. The game started out OK but then started to drop in intrest. This game got boring fast, and I returned the stupid thing early it was so bad! My advise, get Golden Sun for GBA, Wind Waker for GC, or FFX for PS2.	-1
Everyone was talking about this game by the time I bought it... 10 scores, 5 stars... So, of course, I bought. I'm asking: why? The story is about a mercenary - Samus Aran. I'm not very expert in Metroid stuff, but I knew the Chozo -  a race - created her to be a warrior. The Chozo were "the big guys", with superior technology and stuff... Until one day, some bad guys called the Space Pirates killed most of the Chozo. Samus survived. She grew up and now she's  a great warrior. The game is in future, of course... The planet you'll be in is called Tallon IV... Well, let's go to the real review: - Graphics: OK, here I must say the game rules. The graphics are really perfect. The raindrops fall over your visor,  when it's really hot your visor changes, or when it's cold... I mean... This is one of - if not THE - the best GameCube graphics ever. One of the best game graphics EVER! - Fun: This is where the problem begins... The game is too hard. You must spend something like 40 hours to beat it without a walkthrough... And you have to walk A LOT to go from a place to another one...This makes you REALLY tired... The boss battles make your fingers hurt really bad! You'll surely be confused about controlling Samus. It's really hard too. Every time I play this game, it gives me a big headache. If you think it's fun to be with a big headache and fingers hurting, then this is your game... - Educative: I can't see anything educative here... There isn't any blood, so don't worry with that... Violence? Well, you're just shooting aliens and "bad guys". You aren't killing humans or anything. After all, you just might rent it, or don't even play it... It'll let you really down..	-1
"Metroid Prime."  What is it that makes this game so great?  Is it the graphics?  No. Graphics alone don't make a great game.  Is it the sound, or the game play, or the level design, or the overall emensity?  None of these things defines a great game in and of itself, but all of them come together in "Metroid Prime" to fit pefectly into place and form what is the essential game play experience of the last five years for me.  Now I realize that people have their preferences as far as games are concerned.  Yes I played "Super Metroid" on the Super NES back when it was new, and I liked it.  At the time I thought is was great.  The truth is, "Metroid Prime" capitalizes on the things its predecessor did so well, and then puts it to shame.  I haven't been this enraptured with a video game since playing the original "Thief" on the PC several years ago.  These games have little in common outside of the fact that both of them really made me feel that I was the main character more than any other games ever have.  The world to explore is huge, the bosses and enemies are smart and challenging, and the game is addictive as any can be.  I actually enjoyed it so much that while I progressed, a small part of me was sad that I was that much closer to the end. The bottom line is, if you own a GameCube, you owe it to yourself to own this game.  It is the best available for the system.  If you don't own a GameCube, I will not try to convince Microsoft and Sony faithful to convert, but if any Nintendo game can rightfully tempt customer loyalty, "Metroid Prime" is the one.	1
WHile the graphics and gameplay are excellent, after playing for any extended period of time, you're already 10 percent done with the game, then 20, then 30, and so on. But besides this downfall, the game is very fun and challenging at some points. It's not just a go-out-and-shoot-them-up game. You must apply some brain power to some puzzels that the game has to offer. All in all, most people would find this game great and challenging, plus, if you have a completed version of Metroid Fusion, you can hook it up to Metroid Prime, and get the original Metroid.	1
Holy cow.  What a game.  When you get right down to it, in my opinion, there are only two problems with this game: 1) it ends eventually, and 2) the sequel isn't out yet.  By now, an awful lot has been written about Metroid Prime (MP) and I'm not going to try to reproduce all of that here.  Instead, I'd like to talk about the way the game felt for me, and hopefully some of these impressions can help you decide if you think the game would be right for you. First of all, MP is not a first person shooter (FPS).  I know what you're thinking if you haven't played the game: it sure looks like a FPS.  It is, after all, played from a first person perspective and you do indeed shoot things.  But trust me, it's not and the sooner you shed the notion while playing the game and start playing it the way it was meant to be played, the more you will enjoy it.  So how is MP meant to be played?  Remember the old Metroid games?  Remember how you played them?  They were a mix of action and exploration, platforming and puzzle solving and  this game is no different.  I can't believe how well the people at Retro did in capturing the spirit and gameplay of the Metroid franchise and translating it into three dimensions. Nearly everything from the original game is here and more.  I think the only thing missing is the jump attack.  But all your old weapons (and more) are back and so is the morph ball.  Indeed, the morph ball is much better now than it has ever been and is key to some of the games most exotic puzzles and platforming.  The addition of the spider ball (the ability to stick to magnetic tracks and roll along walls and suspended from the ceiling and so on) is one of the most unique and exotic gameplay devices I have ever experienced.  The various visors you utilize in the game is new to the franchise as well.  Some people won't like the scan visor and all the scanning you have to do to solve puzzles and fill out your log book but I found it to be a very immersive and realisitic storytelling instrument.  Rather than spoonfeeding you the plot through cut scenes, the designers at Retro have given you the power to unfold the world around you.  The other visors, your thermal and x-ray visors, open up the gameplay in fascinating new ways, allowing you to discover some fiendishly cleverly hidden secrets, defeat invisible enemies, and solve some of the puzzles you will encounter. MP is graphically stunning and the sound and music are about as close to perfect as they can be.  Both come together beautifully to create a distinctly alien world and give the technology and the creatures you must battle a unique flavor that I can't put into words.  You must experience it to understand it.  The closest I think I can get is to say that the world of MP is an ancient blend of the mystical and scientific, infused with powerful and exotic technologies and surreal creatures. The control scheme used in MP is really the only controversial point.  If you quickly get beyond the idea that you're playing a FPS and quit trying to circle strafe around every corner and learn to trust the lock-on system you will be amazed at how well it works.  Some people have contested that the lock-on system still isn't quite right.  It doesn't automatically lock onto the  closest enemy or the one who's attacking you and after you defeat an opponent, it doesn't automatically switch to the next closest oppenent.  These are valid complaints but I think at that level the function of the lock-on system is a matter of individual taste and style.  Had Retro built the lock on system that way, I think just as many, if not more people, would complain about the lack of freedom in the lock-on system.  I think I would have been one of those people.  I appreciate the freedom to choose my targets. In the final analysis, video games fall into three categories: 1) worth buying, 2) worth renting, and 3) not worth anything.  MP is absolutely worth renting and maybe should be rented before purchase if you're unsure about whether you will enjoy the platforming and exploration aspects of the game.  But if you've played a Metroid game before and enjoyed it, then it's hard for me to imagine not just buying the game outright.	1
Metroid Prime is probably the best Nintendo game EVER! the graphics are like you're watching a darn movie! the AI is just about perfect (and i mean it) and the controls are like a glove once u get used to it. the world is massive; many games you can play for a couple of hours and your done. Not this game. ive played for a little over 2 hours and im barely even 10% done! if you need one reason to buy a GameCube, this is definitely it!	1
After finally finishing the wonders of Metroid Prime I have made my conclusion. It is worth buying a Gamecube, for this game alone. Being a classic Metroid fan I was honestly not sure how Retro Studios could handle such a delicate title as Metroid. All of my doubts were forgotten within the first hour of play. Not only did they smoothly convert the series into 3-D as first person, but also managed to keep all of the classic aspects that have made the Metroid games so wonderful, from the unique puzzles, to the classic array of weaponry and items, to the tiny nooks for the morph ball. In addition to keeping the old, Metroid Prime has brought in a few new aspects such as the visors. Now instead of just a normal view, you can also look through a scan visor witch magnifies a certain area and allows you to scan certain areas of items for information. Sometimes it might be a wall that you detect slight fractures in or possibly a creature, witch will tell about it, its weaknesses, and then add it to your logbook for future reference. In addition to this you will also find a thermal visor witch will allow you to view things depending on their heat. Great for fighting in the dark or detecting special heat signatures. And Lastly the X-Ray visor. Like in Super Metroid this allows you to check if there are any hollow places in walls but can also help you see invisible platforms and a see special enemy, the Chozo ghost. Overall the new visors have given Metroid a Great new feel. So after my evaluation I can conclude Metroid Prime to be my second favorite game ever, next to Super Metroid. So if you like Metroid games, buy it. If you like puzzle games, buy it. If you like first person games buy it. Otherwise either buy it or at least try it, and be sure to give it a chance, at least a couple hours of play. Trust me, most likely you'll be up all night.	1
As a big fan of Super Metroid, i was wondering how Prime would turn out. I was skeptical at first of it being a First Peron Shooter, thinking it'd just be a new "goldeneye64" or something. I was totally wrong. Nintendo makes use of EVERYTHING the cube has to offer. The world you explore are so unbelivably massive and intricate that sometimes you just want to stop and admire the detail. Most of Metroid is about exploring and scanning. And scanning addds a whole new dimension to the gameplay. Instead of just running around and killing monsters, you are placed in a possision more like an intergalactic detective. You have to scan items, plants and creatures to figure out what the world is and how to best act in it. the controles are the only thing which made me give this a 4 star instead of 5. All of the controles are perfect except for locking on to ememies. How i wish they had just used the goldeneye64 lockon ability! In order to fight many monsters you have to click on the top-left button on the controler, but this can become difficult if you are not facing at least an inch away from the thing you want to shoot. Likewise if the enemies are high from your point of view (something i've noticed them to be quite often) you are forced to stop and manually look up in order to lock on, which gives the enemies ample time to attack you. Once you HAVE locked on, however, it's very easy to manuver since you will alwasy be facing the crucial part you want to attack. That aspect aside, the rest of the game is unbeleivable. The Jump feature is pretty intuitive and just goes to show that you CAN have a good jump button in a first person shooter! (unlike turok! ugh) As mentioned before the worlds are the most enviromental worlds ever. The visual FX are amazing too, with detail so close as to see your reflection in shiny objects and watching show melt on your visor. the creatures are very unique and each one with a different way of approach. Alot of the levels involve searching for clues and switches to access higher grounds, which makes it sometimes feel like mystery than a shoot-em-up. The 3-D map is also a blessing too, since the worlds are so large and gigantic that i've often found myself looking at the map trying to figure out the best possible rout to get to my destination. all in all, this game just goes to show the awsome potential of the gamecube with great gameplay and amazing enviroments.	1
Frankly, I am sorely disappointed with the Game Cube, and am thankful that I haven't purchased one. Metroid Prime is the only reason that I would ever consider purchasing one and I really hope that Xbox buys the rights to make the next game. That said, I loved just about every aspect of this game. It was both long enough and pretty enough to hold my attention. The HUD is the best I've ever seen and I would love to see another game utilize it.	1
"Metroid Prime" is one of the many reasons to buy Nintendo's GameCube, the underdog system that is actually quite good. With its believable graphics, great storyline, and stunningly simple controls, "Prime" might just have a chance at being one of the best games of the new generation of video games. This is definitely a must-buy for GameCube owners, and those who own a GBA will also want to check out its sister game, "Metroid Fusion," which continues the classic side-scroller set by the Metroid games of yore. The pace at which both these games moves is astonishing and involving. Those who say Nintendo is losing touch obviously need to devote a few hours to this game. They're in for a pleasant surprise.	1
At first, I won't deny I was a little disappointed that Metroid was going to the 1st person shooter format (like GOLDENEYE) but after I played the game, I quickly changed my mind. METROID PRIME is easily game of the year! It's totally awesome! The graphics and gameplay are great and all together, I had a lot of fun playing this one. In my opinion, now that it's not a scroller and now a shooter, it's a lot more combat and kick butt orientated. Seriously, it takes a few minutes to get used to it, but after that initial maybe 3 - 5 minutes, you're golden and you won't be disappointed. In any case, this is a great game! You have to pick this one up, whether you're into shooters, adventures or simply a fan of the Metroid series. Get this game and also, check out RESIDENT EVIL 0. Another great title for the Gamecube.	1
this is one of the few games based on a Nintendo character, with a slight twist to the gameplay or game idea, that has gotten nearly unanimous positive feedback, unlike Mario Sunshine or Zelda. This game is part FPS, part puzzle solving, part exploration. A great combination for this game. You start off on a Space Pirate Research Station (...i think that's what it's called). You learn how to use the Grapple Beam, (not much use since you cant use it after until later areas), the Arm cannon, and the Morph Ball. When you defeat the first boss, you have to escape, and in the process, you lose all your power ups (missiles, charge beam, morph ball) and you have to get them back in Chozo Ruins. This game has some unlockable features such as Art Galleries, the Fusion Suit, and even a playable NES version of Metroid. This game has tons of replay value because there will probably be some times in the game where you'll wish you had scanned that boss or collected that power up when you can't. Plus it's an extremely fun game.	1
To start off, I have to admit that I thought the switch from 2D to 3D Metroid wouldn't work well.  I was wrong in all my fears.  This game is simply amazing.  The graphics are smooth, well rendered, not blocky (they stopped using polygons finally :) ), and there is no slowdown in framerate even in the fiercest of battles.  It is so well done, it almost looks like it could be real.  The music is perfect for each level, and never gets annoying.  The music is actually key in some areas as it can designate something about to happen.  The sounds are well done, with every little sound from rain falling to electronic static in your suit.  On top of all that, Metroid Prime supports Dolby Prologic II Surround sound.  The controls are the only downfall to this game.  It can be difficult to target enemies at frist, but after 30-60 min, it becomes almost second nature.  But even so, after 10 hours into the game, you will still be firing missles when you try to bring up the map.  Although it is a little awkward, the controls are fairly easy to pick up as you usually get another upgrade after you've perfected the current upgrade. The gameplay is simply excellent.  Definately a well written story line.  It is supposed to take place just after the first Metroid game, after you've killed Ridley, Kraid, and Mother Brain.  Samus has discovered that the Space Pirates have begun to regroup on the nearby planet of Talon IV.  When she arrives at the orbiting pirate firgate, she finds it nearly deserted and sees evidence of the pirates mutating creatures using a substance known as Phazon.  After exploring the ship and fighting the boss, samus gets knocked back and loses nearly all her current upgrades.  She then heads down to the surface, which is where the story really begins.  While on the surface battling your way through the levels, you must find both upgrades to your suit (visors, weapons, morph ball, etc) and ancient artifacts to unravel the mystery of the Chozo and the Phazon.  To get through the levels and defeat the bosses, you will have to solve "puzzles" such as opening three doors within a time limit making this similar to tomb raider. Now, I know some of you are worried about the Morph ball.  It is somewhat difficult to control, but you will get used to it.  When you switch to morph ball mode, it brings you out to a 3rd person view so you can see the morph ball and most of your surroundings. How long does this game take?  Quite a long time.  As in the 2D metroid games, there is quite a bit of backtracking involved.  You will end up going through each area multiple times as you can reach new places with almost every upgrade your suit receives. Metroid fans will love this new addition to the series as well as newcomers.  I reccommend you stop worrying about the controls and just go buy this game!	1
I've been looking forward to playing metroid prime ever since it came out.  I rented it, and after I returned it, I brought it.  This game is incredible.  This is perhaps the best metroid ever.  And it made me stop playing 1 player halo.  This has 2B 1 uv da best FPS ever made.  The only thing I don't like about this is that it eventualy ends, and no multiplayer.  Other than that, this is a game that will without a doubt make ur gamecube shine, cuz it sure made mine.  I recomend this 2 anyone with a gamecube. Peace	1
Having had the N64 skipped over as far as Metroid games go, fans of the series have been waiting for this one for a long time.  So, to the point: Graphics: Outstanding! The textures of everything from stone floors, to the trees to Samus's armor are flawless.  The light-shows from weapons fire are nothing short of dazzling. Retro Studios really put a lot of effort into this and it shows. Game play: I was concerned when I heard that this was going to be a First Person Perspective game.  It just didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the series. This is the factor that kept me from giving the game five stars instead of four.  As a first person game, it plays great. But as a Metroid game, there are a few things that are missing. Being a FPP game some things just couldn't be done. There's no Screw Attack (the most hurtful absentee).  The Space Jump has been reduced to a double jump (appropriately shown by the High Jump icon).  However, in spite of these small `problems,' Prime plays very well.  Controls are easy to learn.  Response is smooth.  With a training level at the beginning, players should have no trouble picking up on it. Sound: The sound effects are also great.  It seems as much attention to detail was given to sound as it was graphics.  However, music is another matter.  It's rather muted, buried so far into the background you'll hardly notice it's there.  My personal tastes, that's where it belongs, but I know other gamers would disagree. Extra's:  The hookup between the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance adds a lot to the game.  With the Fusion Suit from the Game Boy game and the original 8-bit game both waiting to be accessed, there's plenty to keep this pack interesting for a good long time.	1
I am an old school gamer (Someone who knows what an Atari 2600 is) and so I never judge a game by its graphics.  Graphics are great to add to the feel of a game, this would be an understatement in Metroid Prime.  The graphics are drop dead beautiful.  Nintendo has re-invented itself so many times that it is hard to keep up.  But this is what Nintendo fans around the World have come to expect!  When I first wrote a review for this game, I did not realize that it would be one of the very top games in my collection.  When I am showing friends and family my 'Cube, this is one that I use to show off the power of the little purple cube.  Also Nintendo had dropped the price of this game to extremely cheap levels, DON'T MISS THIS GAME!!!	1
I was getting tired of Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3, (CFS3) I had already done just about everything you could do on it, and I was ready for a better flight sim. I have spent many hours on CFS3 and Microsoft Flight Simulator X. I wanted a WWII combat flight sim, so I spent a lot of time looking them up on the internet and on Amazon. Essentially, I found very little about any of the sims, except for these reviews, and finally decided that the only way to find out which one was the best was to buy all of them. I had a $25 Amazon gift card, plus some extra cash, so I began to buy all the combat flight sims I could find for a reasonable price. I have heard that Combat Flight Simulator 2 Pacific Series is great, but I could not find one within my price range. I now own: Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1 (Europe Series) 1998, Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3 (Battle For Europe) 2007, Janes WWII Fighters 1998, Janes Attack Squadron 2002, and IL-2 Sturmovik (1946) 2006 (which also includes IL-2 Forgotten Battles, Ace expansion pack, and Pacific Fighters) I own many more flight sims than this, but I have found that anything from 1997 or earlier is not even worth talking about because the graphics are so primitive. I have played all these and compared them for a long time, and I have compiled all their attributes into a Pros and Cons list below. If you take the time to read this, you will know what flight sim is right for you.  Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1 (CFS1) (Europe Series) 1998  This sim is based on the earlier portion of the war on the western front, which includes the Battle of Britain, and early operations in France. Flyable aircraft are very limited, but include the Hawker Hurricane, not usually modeled in old flight sims. Many great Battle of Britain planes are present, like the He-111, Do-17, Me-110, Ju-87, Ju-88, and American bombers like the B-25, B-24, and B-17, but these are all non-flyable. There are some unusual missions, like escaping France in a stolen Bf-109, shooting down a traitor in your squadron, and shooting a German generals car out from under the Eiffel Tower! The campaigns are some of the best Ive seen, The Battle of Britain is very engaging, protecting ship convoys from Stukas and U-boats. Rockets and explosions are realistic. CFS1 has pretty bad aircraft graphics, but the ground detail is amazing, taken from an actual satellite. However, this pales since the ground is completely flat except for spiky mountains, and a few badly modeled buildings in the cities. The satellite image also slows down my laptop. AI (Artificial Intelligence) is marginal, fighters attack but know hardly any maneuvers, and enemy bombers don't avoid you. The menu is reasonable, and pretty easy to use.  Pros: Fair Graphics, Fair selection of flyable aircraft, good AI, Fair menu.  Cons: Flat ground, bad aircraft graphics, not enough flyable aircraft, cant fly the P-38 NO MISSION BUILDER (Deal breaker)  What sets it apart: Cool campaigns and missions.  Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3 (CFS3) (Battle For Europe) 2007  This flight sim is based on the whole war on the western front, from the Battle of Britain to the Battle of the Ardennes, and on. Very unique array of aircraft, ALL are flyable! Planes like the B-25, B-26, Ju-88, and Mosquito are fully modeled, from the controllable gunner positions to the damage modeling. Unusual planes like the P-55 Ascender, and Go-229 flying wing are also flyable, though they would never fly in real life. There are many tanks, flak guns, and ship convoys. There is even an invasion fleet on campaigns on a certain day. Missions are reasonable and challenging, the campaigns are great, with maps, separate available missions, and customization of your own personal aircraft. Campaigns are very lengthy and difficult, however. CFS3 wins the prize for labeling: Aircraft, tanks, airbases, factories, refineries, and other objects are all labeled with their distance from you in feet. This, however, makes it somewhat more of an arcade game unless you turn it off. No mission builder, unless you load one for it off the internet, (Have a nice time figuring that out, they deleted the CFS3 website!) Graphics are good, some trees, many different buildings and airbases, relatively detailed ships, and smooth aircraft. Most of Britain, France and Germany are modeled, and even part of Spain and Switzerland. AI is not that great, enemy fighters sometimes ignore you, but have pretty good aim. They also crash by themselves too easily. Tanks have to stay in their formations, and almost never fire at all. The intro video is intense and extremely realistic, with the exception of the Go-229 at the end. The menu shows your customized aircraft and armament parked next to a hanger, which is cool. User interface is good. Menu music is depressing, which is probably intentional. Relatively realistic in all.  Pros: Good graphics, Great selection of Aircraft, Great factories and ship convoys, Good menu.  Cons: Arcade-like, fake-ish prototype aircraft, ditzy aircraft and vehicle AI, NO MISSION BUILDER.  What sets it apart: Flyable medium bombers with gunner positions, and unusual aircraft.  Janes WWII Fighters 1998  This sim is based on the last major German offensive in WWII. The speed and maneuverability of the fighters are slightly embellished towards the Axis aircraft, the German planes are given similar maneuverability to superior aircraft like the P-51, which makes for fair battles on either side. Flyable aircraft are limited to the Spitfire, P-51, P-47, P-38, Bf-109, Fw-190, and Me-262. Many Axis and Allied bombers like the B-17 are included, but they are non-flyable. There is a big selection of tanks, ground vehicles, buildings, and other objects on the mission builder, which is very easy to use. Massive tank battles can be created in just a few seconds by placing  tank divisions on the map. The V-1 Flying Bomb is also on the mission builder. There is also the ability to set an infinite combination of trigger points, which are invisible values, times, and conditions that can cause an action like making more planes appear, or anything else you can think of. The sim has pretty good graphics, though there are almost no trees and the ground is completely flat except for a few buildings and mountains. There is only a small area of land that is modeled, and no water or ships at all. AI is very good, even the best pilot can be shot down by a rookie fighter if hes not careful. Tanks dart away when shot at by planes, but just sit there when other tanks attack. The menu is very fun and easy to use, great user interface. The menu  music is catchy and true to the time period. In-flight music is somewhat annoying. You can learn a lot from the narrated documentaries on each aircraft. All in all pretty realistic, defiantly the best combat flight sim from the 90s.  Pros: Fair graphics, Great selection of ground vehicles, Great mission builder, Great AI, Awesome menu with elevator music, Awesome user interface  Cons: Graphics inferior to newer sims, not enough flyable aircraft, no water or ships, no trains, ditzy tank AI, aircraft AI always wants to fight you head on! (Be careful)  What sets it apart: Great AI, Great mission builder.  Janes Attack Squadron 2002  This sim is based on the bombing raids and air-to-ground attacks of the western front. All aircraft are flyable, including three heavy bombers, the B-17, B-24, and Avro Lancaster with their many bombardier and gunner positions! There are only a few different kinds of tanks, trains, and ships. The physics editor and mission builder appear to be the best ones yet, with waypoint markers, 1 million square miles of detailed terrain to work with, and even terrain sculpting! The only problem is that they are very complicated, and the help and read-me files are corrupted do to a programming error. The full mission builder and physics editor are unsupported by the company, and cannot be found anywhere. So much for the mission builder. There are only 6 pre-made missions, which are pretty good but boring after 12 times. The quick mission builder is good, with multiple aircraft, enemy aircraft, target, weather, and time settings, although you cannot select location or direction and are limited to 32 aircraft. With this you create awesome bombing missions, with formations of bombers attacking massive, detailed cities, with defending fighters swarming around. Terrain graphics are relatively good, but defiantly an improvement over Janes WWII fighters. Buildings are very detailed, from houses and hangers with individual windows, to massive factories and even small sky scrapers. Bomber details are pretty good, but fighters are kind of boxy with less curves. Damage modeling is great, bullet and flak holes appear when hit. The fighter AI is good, though not quite as good as WWII Fighters. The bomber AI, however, is superb. Bombers fly in close formation without ever crashing, (Imagine that!) and gunnery accuracy is better than any other flight sims bombers. Set to aces, a formation of 6 B-17s can shoot down a Bf-109 in less than 5 seconds! Ground vehicles, tanks, and ships have no AI whatsoever, and just go through their waypoints no matter what. The menu is very easy to use, and the menu music is not too annoying. The intro and in-flight music are cool.  Pros: Good graphics, Ability to fly all bombers, Great bomber AI, Good user interface.  Cons: Graphics inferior to newer sims, bad aircraft graphics, bad selection of ground vehicles, unusable/way-to-hard-to-use mission builder.  What sets it apart: Ability to fly the B-17, B-24, and Lancaster and control gunner positions.  Ubisoft IL-2 Sturmovik (1946) 2006  This sim includes all of the previous IL-2s made by Ubisoft before 2006, so any other ones like IL-2 Forgotten Battles and Pacific Fighters are not necessary. IL-2 1946 includes most of WWII on the Western front, the Pacific front, but focuses on the Eastern Russian front. The 1946 portion focuses on an alternate timeline in which all the major leaders like Roosevelt, Stalin, and Hitler have died and the new leaders send their countries into vastly different paths than those of reality. The war continues into 1946 where both Allies and Axis have advanced rocket and jet aircraft. Some U.S.S.R. aircraft are even as advanced as the MiG-15, some even more. German late-war prototype aircraft like the Go-229 have materialized and are used in combat. Even guided missile technology is available. I have to admit, that at first, I was a bit skeptical since IL-2 1946 was designed in Russia. It turns out that as I suspected, IL-2 is significantly embellished towards the U.S.S.R., (I wonder why?) with more Russian aircraft than U.S., British, and French aircraft combined. But when I realized what else IL-2 had to offer, I knew this was the best combat flight sim of all time. IL-2 includes over 400 different aircraft from the USSR, US, Britain, France, Germany, Norway, Finland, Romania, Slovakia, Australia, Japan, Singapore, China, and more! At least 250 of these are flyable, including: The A-20, B-25, P-38, P-39, P-40, P-47, P-51, P-63, YP-80, F2A Buffalo, SBD Dauntless, F4F Wildcat, F6F Hellcat, F4F Corsair, Hurricane, Spitfire, Tempest, Beoufighter, Mosquito, I-153, I-16, Mig-3, Yak-3, Pe-2, and so many more that it would take a whole page to fit them. Many non-flyable never-before-modeled aircraft are present also, like the massive Me-323 6-engined transport, Ju-88 Mistel flying bomb, Fw-200 Condor, and many more. There are hundreds of different meticulously detailed tanks, vehicles, and warships. One of my favorite things about IL-2 is that the Pacific front of the war is included, along with US Navy and Japanese carrier borne aircraft, a great selection of Japanese land-based planes, the B-29, (non-flyable. Boo hoo.) submarines, torpedo boats, destroyers, cruisers, battleships, and many aircraft carriers. The mission builder is great, with 3D maps, condition settings, and infinite waypoint combinations. Tanks and other vehicles stick to roads when possible, but will go almost anywhere you program them to. The world is divided into separate smaller maps, which you can select. Many fronts are present, like Normandy, The Ardennes, Berlin, Gulf of Finland, Manchuria, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Midway, Hawaii, Moscow, and many more Russian maps. You can program waypoints for aircraft, tanks, and ships, and set the speed, altitude, direction, skill, paint job, gun accuracy, firing rate, and more. The missions are good, but you will find that you will enjoy making your own missions much more. The aircraft, vehicle, ship, building, sky, ocean, and terrain graphics are all unparalleled by any other sim, with outstanding detail from huge forests of 3D trees and rocky mountains, to super detailed buildings and tanks with words even visible on the sides! You can even see personnel at their positions on ships! The AI for everything is incredible, enemy aircraft know advanced maneuvers, tanks aim their turrets and fire at enemies, and ship turrets and flak guns fire accurately at targets. However, IL-2s user interface is lousy. The menu is boring and has tiny buttons for everything, but this is nothing compared to the quick and full mission builders. For over 350 aircraft, and a few thousand other vehicles, buildings, and objects, there are tiny drop down lists which you must scroll through to select anything. The scroll bar is 3/16ths of an inch wide, (I kid you not!) and is so short that it takes about 30 seconds to get your curser centered over it. When zoomed in to a map, it switches to 3D mode for the entire terrain, so this will slow down your computer and curser significantly unless you have a high-end graphics card. Between this and the scroll bars of death, it is almost impossible to do anything on the mission builder without a good mouse. My cousin owns IL-2, and he can hardly move his curser at all on the mission builder. The frame rate in flight is about  to 2 frames per second, (F.P.S.) which is horrible. Target F.P.S. is usually about 20 F.P.S.. This is probably because his graphics card is outdated. However, I have a very old IBM ThinkPad laptop with Windows XP, and IL-2 works just fine on it. If possible though, you want a high-end graphics card, and a large screen. The intro music is pretty cool, but when you hear the main menu music, you will burst out laughing. It sounds like circus music, or something from a corny cartoon. But, amazingly, IL-2 gives you the ability to change system files, unlike most other sims, so you can switch the circus music with something less annoying. There is also the issue of swearing. The box says it includes mild swearing, but I would debate that. At some points, it seems like all the pilots ever say is the same swearword over and over, which is not realistic anyways since Japanese, German, Russian, and French pilots wouldnt speak English. But, luckily, again you can change this in a notepad system file called conf.ini, by changing the noswearing: value from 0 to 1, and save. I really appreciate the ability to change system files on this sim, you can fix many of the annoying problems once and for all. All in all, this is the BEST combat flight sim my friends or I have ever seen, defiantly a must-have for WWII airplane buffs. Since IL-2 1946, Ubisoft has come out with more combat flight sims, I have not bought any of these yet, though.  Pros: Incredible graphics, Ability to fly many medium bombers, Amazing selection of flyable and non-flyable aircraft, Great AI, Many war fronts available, Awesome ships. Ability to change system files.  Cons: Cant fly heavy bombers like the B-17, B-24, B-29, etc, Russian embellishment, Bad user interface, Runs slowly on older graphics cards.  What sets it apart: Unmatched graphics and realism, Huge selection of aircraft, tanks, vehicles, and ships.  Thank you for reading this, now I don't feel like I wrote all this for nothing.	1
The original SNES Metroid was a masterpiece, there is no doubt about that. The GameCube debut of this first-person shooter version furthers the legacy that is Metroid. What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's fun, it has great graphics, and it's SO Samus! Buy it; you won't be disappointed!	1
Finnaly!  A game for Gamecube that doesn't have serious weaknesses.  Fun and exciting, this is a masterpiece.  I love how you can roll up into the ball and roll around to your hearts desire!  That's probably my favorite thing to do (hah).  The weapons are great; you get to use weapons like the grapple beam and wave beam, and you get to fire missiles!  The charger is also really cool...you can charge it for as long as you want, and use it to pull in items.  And graphics!  This may possible have the best graphics for the cube.  Samus's armor actually glitters grom the star light.  It's awesome.  Although it doesn't have multi-player, I would say this beats Halo completely!	1
This is the first game I bought for Gamecube, and of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube games I've played, this is one of the best.  A first-person-shooter based from the earlier Metroid games, which were side scrollers, this is an action game for all people, whether fans of the other Metroid games or not.  As a FPS, this is one of the very best I've played on a platform, though there is a flaw.  In many console and PC FPS games, you can look around as you run, but this isn't so in Metroid Prime.  In this game, you need to stop moving if you want to look around, which is a major downside.  Other than that, the game is awesome.  This game brings elements from the earlier games and transforms them beautifully into a 3D environment.  Metroid Prime has wonderful environments, from the fiery Magmoor Caverns to the icy Phendara Drifts, sometimes I just have to take a look around the room I'm in to take in all the detail that has gone into the game.  The enemies are all excellently transformed from 2D to 3D in the case of Metroids and other enemies from the older games, and are all very well made.  My only complaint, besides that there is no way to look around while running, is that the way the story is presented, there doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency to what's happening.  The main plot is that you, Samus Aran, after investigating an abandoned Space Pirate ship, have learned that the Space Pirates are trying to harvest a deadly poison brought to the planet Talon IV on an asteroid, Phazon, to use in their weapons and as a power source.  You spend the rest of the game going around Talon IV trying to recover twelve artifacts left by the Chozo, an ancient race who went to Talon IV after deciding that technology was not what they wanted, and were eventually killed by the Phazon.  Samus must get to where the Chozo contained the asteroid that brought Phazon to Talon IV and keep the Phazon from getting into the hands of the Space Pirates.  You travel between the four main areas of the game, the Talon Overworld, Chozo Ruins, Magmoor Caverns, and Phendara Drifts, to find upgrades to your weapons as well as new abilities.  As you travel, you will gain access to new areas based on what you have.  For instance, upon gaining the ability that allows you, in morph ball form, to gain boosts of speed, you can launch yourself up a half-pipe wall to gain the double-jump ability, which allows you to jump to a previously unreachable ledge, and the result is that you can get the wave beam, so that you can unlock new kinds of doors, and so on.  The game, in short, is excellent, and I recommend buying it for anyone.  If you don't like action games, then rent it first, but otherwise, it is a must-have for anyone's game collection.	1
Metroid Prime is awesome. It is fun, challenging, and graphically beauitiful.  I have had no flaws with this game.  Everything is perfect.  Between the three runner ups for game of the year for 2002 (GTA: Vice City PS2, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Xbox, and Metroid Prime GC)I think Metroid Prime takes the cake.  The graphics gameplay and sound all equal up to one perfect game. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Value: 10/10	1
First, I want to say that, Super Metroid is one of my favorite games of all time, and having to wait nine years for the next masterpiece in the series nearly killed me. After all of this waiting though, I have to say that it was definintly worth the wait! Gameplay: 10/10 The reason Nintendo took so long to make the next installment of the beloved Metroid series is because of the tough transition to 3D. They suceeded nicely with Mario, and Zelda, and with the Nintendo Gamecube out, they figured it was time to try and bring Metroid into the 3D world. Many fans were dissapointed to find out that it was moved to the first person view, but finally, we can put all of our worries to rest; the gameplay is pretty much flawless, and many have said it's just like Super Metroid, only in 3D, which is a good thing. The other problem that comes along with Metroid in first person is the platforming, which has always been a huge part of the series; the jumping, and everything is the best to be done in a first person game ever, and in no time you will be able to jump around on platforms in your sleep. Now on to the level design, which has always been the strong point in the series; dare, I say it's even better than Super Metroids? Well, I don't know about that, but it's extremly good, and you will never find yourself getting bored with it, even when your passing through that area for the fifth time or so, trying to find all of those extra goodies; and the magnificent artistic designs in this game only make it all the more interesting, and fun to play through. ANOTHER worry(yes, I had many worries about this game)I had about this game was with it now being in first person, would it still have the exploration that made Metroid what it is, or would it become just another lame first person shooter? Thank god it's all there, and in some cases it's better than Super Metroid. The thing that really adds to the exploration like in past games, is the item finding; the extra weapons, power ups, and the like are all there, and while not as cleverly hidded as Super, they still present a fun challenge when you are trying to find them. The last thing I will touch on are the bosses; as we all know huge, and very intense bosses have been another one of the strong points in the series. There's massive bosses, small bosses, medium bosses, and some very clever bosses that require you to use your brain; overall I liked the bosses in this game even better than Super Metroid, and there's alot more of them. Graphics: 9/10 The graphics are very good, with the only problem being that when you get up close to objects, they are pretty bland; I never payed attention to this more than once in the game though. The reason they look bland is because they wanted to keep the game running at a smooth 60 frames per second, and that is much, much more important than some bland objects. The graphics may not wow you, or your friends when playing the game, but the art in this game is amazing, and easily makes up for it. Sound: 10/10 The Super Metroid music still remains some of the best in a videogame to this day, and the same guy that did that game has made a return for Prime. He reused some of the previous Metroid tunes, and they sound better than ever; while he also added new tunes into the mix. The music is just flat out great, and will not dissapoint! Overall: 10/10 or 5 stars Metroid Prime brings back the great atmosphere, gameplay, and fun of Super Metroid, but in an all new 3D world. It's an instant classic, and pretty high on my list of greatest games of all time; DO NOT pass this game up!	1
The 8 year layoff in the Metroid series has left Samus fans in a state of longing.  Her appearances in both "Super Smash Bros." games helped slightly, but there was no replacement for the fun and adventure of leading Samus in a battle against Mother Brain and/or the other Metroids.  With the frustration of Metroid having skipped the N64 system, fans were getting restless.  It can be said, unequivocally, that "Metroid Prime" for GameCube brings Samus back in a big way and more than satiates the cravings of all Metroid fans.    It should be noted that "Metroid Prime" is actually a prequel of sorts.  It takes place before the events of "Super Metroid" (on Super NES), but still presents some familiar foes (Ridley, anyone?) while introducing a plethora of new ones.  One obvious area of concern for Metroid fans would be how this game could be translated from the perfect side-scroller into an effective game in GameCube's dynamic 3-dimensional environment.  The same concerns existed when "Super Mario Brothers" made a similar transition on the N64 system.  "Super Mario 64" made a smooth transition that opened up new worlds and new perspectives for fans of that series.  "Metroid Prime" accomplishes the same goal, but on a grander scale.  There is an initial battle scene aboard a battle-ravaged space station (similar to "Super Metroid") that helps players get the feel for all the controls and how the game functions.  It is not overly difficult.  It is just very different.    As Samus, the player employs a 'first-person shooter' perspective that comes complete with special visors and scanners that allow Samus to view a variety of different items in her travels.  In the beginning, Samus has combat and scanning visors that are necessary to all actions in the game.  The combat visor allows Samus to lock onto a fire at targets while the scanning visor allows her to scan for information from computers, about creatures, about artifacts, and various other bits of knowledge that will help Samus on her way.  There are thermal and x-ray visors to be acquired later that enable Samus to have different ways of viewing her surroundings.  They makes some boards easier to see, reveals some necessary secrets, and are absolutely essential to defeating some of the later bosses.  In addition to the visors, Samus can (and will need to) acquire up to 4 different types of weapons.  She starts with the power beam, but will also end up acquiring the ice beam, the energy beam, and the plasma beam.  The ability to charge these beams for extra destructive powers returns from the earlier games.  Missiles and morph bombs also return.  What is most fascinating about Samus' arsenal is that there are combination attacks that can be acquired throughout the game.  These combination attacks will combine the power of a specific beam, the missiles, and the charger to create a vicious attack.  Acquiring these weapons and then learning how and when to use them is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game.    The game, itself, involves Samus traveling to the world of Tallon IV, the former home to an ancient species of alien called the Chozo.  Tallon IV was devastated by an asteroid impact some time earlier and the subsequent poison gas, called 'Phazon', was released and effectively destroyed the Chozo species.  Of course, in the current time frame, the infamous Space Pirates decided they want to try and harness the destructive, but powerful, Phazon energy to fuel their weapons of destruction.  Samus must travel to Tallon IV to thwart to Space Pirates and help rid the planet of this toxic presence.  Samus goes into an exploratory mode similar earlier Metroid games.  Samus has four regular zones in Tallon IV to investigate (Tallon IV Overworld, the haunting Chozo Ruins, the fiery Magmoor Caverns, and the calm, but dangerous, icy Phendrana Drifts.), plus the important Phazon Mines and Impact Crater zones.  Samus must travel back and forth through all of these zones (except the Impact Crater) looking to recover various Chozo artifacts that will eventually allow Samus to enter the Crater and destroy the cause of all this misery.  Make no mistake, though, this is not your father's Metroid.  Whereas earlier Metroid games (and even the new "Metroid Fusion" for Gameboy Advance) could be completed in 3 hours or less of elapsed time, "Metroid Prime" will take closer to 20 hours!  There will be a lot of back tracking, searching, and battles with numerous enemies (sometimes repeated).  A lot of time and effort must be invested to win this game, but there is no doubting satisfaction that is to be derived from accomplishing that goal.  "Metroid Prime" continues to raise the bar on Nintendo's games and sends a message to other platforms that this is THE standard to strive for.	1
Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people.	1
I got this game for my son. After installing, my son only played it once and he said it's boring! So he never play it again.	-1
This game is crash happy, and no patches from microsoft seem to work, with winVista or any directX. I pitched my copy of it...just could not get it to stop crashing.	-1
After being a very avid fan of Combat Flight Simulator 2 for almost six months, my computer crashed and many of the CFS2 files were lost, and missing disc 1, I couldn't reinstall the game. Figuring I was getting bored of it anyway I began considering the purchase for the third installment in the CFS franchise. When I first got this game, I was blown away in the first thirty seconds by the graphics of the game, then thirty-one seconds in the program crashed due to overheating. If you want this game, and you have a laptop, consider getting a cooling pad our you will put yourself through a lot of grief with this problem. The campaign mode in this game can be very confusing, it is a living map and the actions that you perform affect the games outcome.  The game puts you in the cockpit of a fighter pilot from USA, Britain, or Germany, as well as having the option of being a bomber pilot (you can switch as a gunner, pilot, or bombardier in any mission)from any of the three countries. To win the campaign you kind of have to understand what happened in world war II, as the whole concept is that you can change the outcome of the war. Aside from the campaign, there is a mission builder that you can obtain from the website (just google it!) so if the game isn't enough for you, you can design your own missions and completely run away from any historical accuracy to make absurdly intense missions (which I highly reccomend.) Because as a fighter you are doing primarily ground attack missions, the game doesn't come as much of a challenge, so changing the realism options (how much your plane really behaves like a real plane such as G-effects, stall speeds ect.) makes the game quite challenging. If you find that you ran out of stuff to do, don't forget there is always quick combat and historical and What-If (mainly early Jet Fighter dogfights) to keep you entertained. Make sure you always challenge yourself with new missions because doing the same mission over and over can get pretty dull.  In conclusion   This game is really a unique experience, as the game its self puts you in a world of endless aerial scenarios that will rock your socks day in and day out! If you are a huge fan, consult some CFS3  forums, where Add-ons that can really enhance your gaming experience!	1
How Microsoft ever developed the neat original Combat Flight Simular and then went backwards is beyond me.  This new simulator is a real disappointment.  They do not even have a training section for landings... which everyone liked to use in the old package.  Or it is too hard to find for if it is there I cannot find it.  UGH....  Mike L	-1
Samus returns in a new adventure that is truly a masterpiece of gaming.  Although the first-person perspective is a change from the previous games, it works very well.  But this is anything but just another first-person shooter.  It is really more of an exploration game, and it is huge.  It would take quite a lot of time and dedication to complete 100% of this game, including scanning everything.  But don't worry, you can turn on "hints" to find all the necessary items in the game.  There are even secrets to be unlocked if you link this game to Metroid Fusion on the Game Boy Advance. More than that, the game has a level of detail that is currently unmatched.  The visor, for example, actually fogs up and gets splattered on, then clears up as you pass the obstacle.  At certain times, based on the lighting, you can see your reflection on the inside of the visor.  A whole lot of work went into this game, and it really shows.  This is a must-own title.	1
I first played Metroid when it came out. I was about 9 or 10 at the time. At first I was confused at the strange concepts it presented, such as a level-less world, unusual enemies, and music that sounded good even for a Nintendo. I think my favorite part about it was the similarities to the Alien movies. I had never seen such a huge game take place on just one level, and the game had it's own type of genuinely surreal atmosphere that was impossible to reproduce on other games. Prime recreates all that, and then some. Fans will be unbelievably pleased at how true this game is to the rest of the series. It takes place between Metroid 1 and Metroid 2, so younger gamers that never got to play the first one will be able to get a handle on the story from the beginning (if that kind of initiative is still left in kids today...). The game is not seperated into levels (that was a great fear lingering in our heads), so you can still go anywhere you want anytime you want. I'm still looking for secret areas now. Now for the big secret, I'm sure many of you have heard, if you have Prime and Fusion (for Advance), and have beaten both of them, you can not only use Samus's Fusion armor in Prime, but you can access the original NES game. I've no idea how to do this stuff - I don't have an Advance, but I think it's worth mentioning, since Metroid has been famous for its secrets hidden stuff. It's only missing one thing - EVERY Metroid game has come out directly after a new Alien movie. Now, this is entirely understandable, since there is no Alien 5 yet (I think that's why they left Prime between the first two games, so that in case an Alien 5 DOES come out, they can have room for a real Metroid 5). But think about it: every Metroid game has plot elements that take after the respective Alien movie. If you want to see some real detail about it, go to the Features section of the Metroid Database website. There's a whole list comparing game-to-movie. So of course I recommend this game! It'll please old Metroid veterans with a new challenge (see if it's got any Secret Worlds or Wall-door techniques :-P), and get new fans into the series.	1
Short version: It. Does. Not. Run.  Take your money and set fire to it, you'll save time trying to troubleshoot this piece of crud -- it just wasn't written very robustly. Or, if you'd rather, buy it and spend three hours downloading various patches and trying to tweak various settings on your machine trying to get it to function.  The emperor wears no clothes. This is badly written software and it should not be purchased by anyone for any reason. Microsoft produces trash as far as I'm concerned and I'm angry with myself for not remembering that, I wanted to play this game, I wanted it to FUNCTION on a basic level AND IT DOES NOT DO SO. THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT FUNCTION. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!	-1
I'm sorry, but the CFS3 flight modeling is really bad. I don't mean hard to learn, I mean just bad. Using what they call realistic settings makes flying an excercise in frustration. I still remember my fisrt campeign mission as a bomber pilot, take off in rain at night. No lights, nothing, you can't even see a taxi-way, let alone a runway. I made it off the ground somehow, eventually the sun came up. I got close to target, I'm supposed to launch a torpedo from a B26 into an enemy ship. As you can imagine, that is pretty close to impossible to pull off, especially with the way everything is modeled.  On a simple bomber intercept mission, I unloaded all of my ammunition into an enemy bomber at 500 yards or less and nothing happened. I mean nothing, no apparent damage. I'm sure I missed with 50% of the shots, but hit with more than enough to saw off a wing and kill all of the crew to boot!  Flying a fighter of any kind at any speed/altitude feels like flying a 747. If you enter a dive, your lack of manuverability means that you will probably pick up so much speed that you will create a new crater in the countryside. Roll response is not all that bad, but pitch is under modeled on almost all of the planes. There may have been some deliberateness to this because dogfights feel more like gun camera footage than a simulator like IL2. In other words they may have tried to give an authentic feel by dampening manuvers to the point that things happen in a slower motion that other simulators. I don't think this is a terrible idea, but they didn't get it quite right and with the gun damage being so under-modeled you will be frustrated with dog fights and intercept missions.  Air to ground is a little better, although the sluggish controls make pulling out of a strafing run a little too exciting. It also seems like strafing is a little too easy, a quick burst of bullets will obliterate an entire supply depot and end the mission. When I say quick burst, I mean just tap the trigger!  Overall, I think they could have done a much better job with this game. I like the idea of the big campaign, but it just doesn't quite come together and isn't worth the time. This game requires more patience than I'm willing to give it.	-1
I have never liked first person shooters... or any video games that are done in first person perspective for that matter.  When I first heard about this game I just dismissed it like I do all first person games.  Eventually, however, all the excellent reviews got to me so I broke down and bought a copy. After only a couple of minutes playing this game, I knew it wasn't like anything I'd ever played before, first person perspective or not.  I couldn't believe how much I liked it.  First of all, I don't really see it as a first person shooter.  It's more of an adventure game in first person perspective.  The game is about puzzle-solving, jumping, and exploration as much as it is about blasting enemies with your big, cool, beam gun. The graphics are absolutely beautiful and the controls are very intuative.  It was very easy to pick up and play.  The auto-aim feature makes the game playable and fun for practically anyone.  Somehow, they've even made first person jumping enjoyable instead of frustrating. This game is incredibly fun.  It's one of the best games I've played this year.  One of the best games I've ever played, period!  If you love games, you NEED a copy of Metroid Prime!	1
I must confess that I was among the many nay Sayers who doubted that Metroid could work as a first person "shooter." The problem with my assumption is that I assumed that the game would be a first person shooter to begin with, its not; its an adventure.  I don't know how Retro Studios did it, but now that I have this game in hand I can't stomach the idea of a 3D Metroid in any other perspective, granted that with a 3rd person view you could do some of Samus' cooler tricks like the screw attack, but in all honesty I don't miss it. I'm too consumed by this overwhelming game. From the moment I landed on Talon IV and saw the world around me I knew that this game would be huge, and it has owned my soul ever since. I still can't help but feel overwhelmed by this simply amazing game. Metroid Prime is the definitive Metroid game, and being a die-hard fan of Super Metroid that is saying quite a lot. I'm surprised to see how well this game works, from the bomb jumps to the hidden secrets, to the exploration, and feeling of claustrophobia. Everything that has made Metroid so cool in the past is present and accounted for in 3D.  Graphically the game is breath taking. I cannot think of a better-looking game out there, this exceeds even Resident Evil, and it runs at a smooth and constant 60 frames per second. I always thought that the one advantage the XBox had over GameCube was reflective and metallic surfaces, this is no longer the case, as Metroid Prime exceeds even the greatest XBox efforts in every aspect.  The sound effects are amazing, and the story (obtained through liberal application of the scan visor) is surprisingly deep and, yet again overwhelming. The music is MIDI, but unlike Star Fox its something I appreciate, as many of the tunes have a nostalgic relevance as the game uses the same MIDI, or slightly remixed Midis from previous games, as well as some new tunes that get stuck in your head just as easily. Very atmospheric, very cool.  All in all I can't give this game any less than a perfect score. It's been eight years since we've had a new Metroid game, and it's been eight years well worth the wait. Do not hesitate to buy this game, if you don't have a GameCube to play it on go buy one! Trust me, you do not want to miss this epic adventure!	1
This game lived up to the hype as far as I am concered. I have never had so much fun playing a game in my life. For starters this game is so amazingly detailed it's almost sickening. You can interact with almost anything. Take birds flying overhead for instance... They aren't enemies and they are merely part of the sky in the room, but you can shoot them, and they do die. Try laying a morph ball bomb into a puddle of water and you get waves that react to the bomb so realsticly that it boggles my mind. Little things like that make this game the most detailed game I have ever played, and it doesn't stop there. The enemies have rag-doll physics. If you shoot an enemy on a platform or a hill he doesn't merely fall down and die, he reacts to his environment accordingly (ie falling down the hill or off the platform or even hanging FORM the platform if he is posistioned correctly. Sound FX is also amazing with the help of Dolby Pro Logic II this game really gives you the sense of being behind samus's visor. When you hear an enemy behind you and can react accordingly this really helps. Also items in this game make a very slight pulsating noise if you listen hard enough you can find hidden items this way. Music is great as in pervious metroids it really gives an errie feeling to the game. I liked the fact that they brought in a few of the old tunes from previous metroids, but even more would have been welcome. Quite a few people have been complaining about the constant backtracking in this game. They don't seem to realize that this has always been part of the Metroid series, and I find the game to be much more difficult and interesting because of it. The worlds are linked together such that you should never have to go very far if you use a little common sense in getting to your destination. The visor issue is one that people have touched on as well but Nintendo has included settings in the game that allow you to tweak this effect to your liking. Controls are another issue with some people. I can say that the controls take some getting used to, but after that they work flawlessly in my opinion. Another subject I would like to hit on is storyline... Some people have mentioned there isn't much of a storyline to this game, and to that I would ask: "What have you been smoking?". Scanning is the key to this game, and if you scan enough you'll find that you can acquire enough information to write a novel on this game. The storyline in this game in my opinion is only matched by Eternal Darkness as far as Gamecube games go. Don't believe what people say this game is NOT a first person shooter, sure the perspective is first person but similarites end there. 75% of this game is exploration, the only time shooting becomes vital is when facing a boss. Beating this game was one of the most rewarding experiences I ever had playing a game, and if a game can make me feel like this one did it deffinately deserves 5 stars! Metroid Prime is by far the best game out right now, and an instant classic. This game is what gaming is all about. Buy IT!!	1
This is the best game out for gamecube. The graphics is the best. Its got lots of action. The bosses are the best ever and huge. This is just the best game ever. It has lots of rooms to explore and lots of monsters. I love this game.	1
I now own the game, and let me tell you the only thing worth saying for an overall description is HUBBA HUBBA!. The graphics are gorgous , the music is somptuous, and although there is no voice acting, the sound effects are great. At one point, the laserfight got so intense  her face reflected in the visor. I know Halo style controls aren't very easy to pick up, but once you know them it's much easier for exploring, aand that would have been a nice touch instead of previously mentioned Goldeneye style controls. The best graphic effects are probably the space-warp around the charge beam shot, and the x-ray visor look of the enemies. (by the way it's not a nightvisor, it's x-ray if you own the game all you have to do is look in the instruction booklet. no offense ;) The story line is great, the gameplay is fun and incredibly addictive, and the game, unless you know it by heart, or arew an avid FPs player like myself, will take you at least 20-25 hours to beat, which promises hours of endless fun. Anyways it's all it was expected to be and i give it 10/100 and now  if you'll excuse me i have to grab my gun and cause some trouble on Tallon IV. American Cheese	1
this game is awesome i love the dogfights the bombing runs are excellent the realism on it is unnelievable. great game i recomend it to all.	1
Utterly disappointing... And this from a chap who gave Microsoft's FS 2004, FS 2002 and Combat Flight Sim 2 - 5 stars respectively.  The box notes claim that "Combat Flight Sim 3 was built using an entirely new graphics engine", if this is truly the case (and there's no reason for me to dismiss this statement as a bold faced lie) then my next burning question would be... "For the love of God, why?!"  Although I love to fly (simulated that is) I have to admit I am first and foremost a graphics geek, so my eyes tend to bend that way immediately and on first inspection of CFS 3 I was struck by the lack of  "pop" CFS 3 offers visually, sure the aircraft skins are top notch, but beyond that the textures are flat, the sky looks as if someone simply scattered a handful of cottons balls over a blue field, the menus look like something pulled off the shelves way back in the mid 90's (remember those days) matter of fact CFS 1 was a stellar achievement compared to the milk toast drabness of Microsoft's latest "combat" outing.  And oh yes did I mention the panels, cockpits and pathetic gunner views of the fighters and bombers are so dated visually that I thought at first glance my graphics settings were on low?  NOTE ON MY SPECS (for reference): Compaq Presario 8000T, Pentium 4 - 3.20E GHz processor, Windows XP Home Edition, 1 GB DDR / PC3200 Ram, 160GB 7200 rpm Seagate Barracuda hard drive, 16X max. DVD-ROM Drive, 256MB DDR ATI Radeon 9600 (Direct X 9), Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (needless to say I had the offender in question maxed out!).  The poor visuals inside these buckets of bolts only compound an even greater problem... playability or flyability (are those real words?).  The heads-up targeting display is arranged at such an awkward angle that training your sights on the enemy is like navigating a high-wire on the tip of your tong, you can't see where you're going and trying to think ahead of your enemy's AI is near impossible because you can't see him and the oldest trick in the book of leading your target simply doesn't apply here because your forced to blindly spray a line of bullets somewhere into space in a direction you think or hope your quarry might be headed!  I could go on and on but I simply don't have the mental strength or enough negative adjectives to describe the horror that is found inside such a pretty box.  Hopes were high, then crushed by nothing short of an amateur offering by an industry giant.  It makes me wonder, does the design team responsible for this flagrant act of shoddy craftsmanship still have jobs at Microsoft and if so are they wearing gray uniforms and carrying buckets and mops?  Microsoft should be nothing short of embarrassed by CFS 3, it's a tremendous set back for the true innovator of flight sim technology.  Look out Microsoft UbiSoft's on your six with IL2: Forgotten Battles (which looks better, runs better and feels better), they've got four gold stars stenciled neatly on their fuselage and they're looking to make that five.	-1
Combat Flight Simulator 3: Battle for Europe is a great game. Its only fun when you have the joystick. You can pick from German, British and American planes. Its more realistic than Combat Flight Simulator 2. You can even fly bombers and be a gunner. The missions are alot harder than the ones in Combat Flight Simulator 2. Most of the time you get shot down by flack. Now you can crashland. It was anoying when you crash landed and just stayed there forever in Combat Flight Simulator 2. You can get medals. Its easy to get them. Its hard to live through bombing misions because the flack and the blast from the bombs make you crash. If you liked Combat Flight Simulator 2 you will probably like Combat Flight Simulator 3. Its impossible to shoot down planes with the amount of amo they give you but you can go to settings and put unlimited amo on. The fuel is very annoying. You allways get hit in the fuel tank. You allways lose all you fuel. Theres 3 bombers and alot of fighter planes. You can get topedos now. Theres almost no ships so there useless. Theres even multiplayer and campain mode. Theres also alot of locations to fly in. Combat Flight Simulator 3 is the best.	1
This game is a current champ and an instant classic!!  The environments are enormous and beautul, the gameplay is tight and simple for a first-person shooter.  The enemies are back, with new twists and frills- and your power-ups come with thermal visors, x-ray visors, spider-ball and phazon beam.  What more can you ask for in a game?  Another thing:  compared with Halo (which has loading times) Metroid Prime wins big-time with wonderful graphics Halo wished it had and 60 frames per second with no loading time!  Shoot and go- fast action!  You must buy this game!!!	1
Not since ICO has a game hit me in the gut like Metroid Prime. The sense of isolation on Tallon IV is so strong it almost hurts, and really bonds you to Samus and her quest.  And yet, discovery is around every corner, underneath every stone, behind every door, urging you onwards.  And of course, you're not alone.....but you'll learn that soon enough. The scan visor is pure genius:  reading the scattered documents speaks volumes, despite there being no voice acting at all.  You'll get chills reading discarded files of the evil Space Pirates' terrible experiments, and feel sadness at uncovering long-lost writings of the vanished Chozo race.  There are literally hundreds of items to scan - I mean, you can scan the GRASS, for goodness' sake.  In spite of this, there's no shortage of running, gunning action:  Metroid Prime is equal parts 30th-century Indiana Jones and Doom. The details make the game:  tilt your visor upwards on the Tallon Overworld and watch the rain splatter on it.  Tilt it downwards, and the rain runs off....and splashes off your energy cannon.  Run through lava-filled Magmoor Caverns and watch your visor fog up.  Detonate a bomb close-by, and Samus' eyes will reflect in the visor.  There's so much to see, you can spend hours just fooling around taking in the sights. Metroid Prime is a master creation that will be remembered for years to come.  It's technically brilliant on all fronts, constantly rewards, innovates and surprises, and is always coaxing you onward just...a little....longer.  Combat is perfect.  Control is perfect (once you get past what Halo and Quake may have taught you).  The map won't let you get lost. Nintendo and Retro have not only created the best game of 2002 in Metroid Prime, they've crafted one of the best ever.  Not much left to be said....highest possible recommendation - do yourself a favor and don the suit of Samus.	1
Metroid Prime turned out a lot better than I expected, and I had high hopes for the game to begin with. It doesn't feel like an FPS at all to me (which is what scared a lot of fans), but strangely enough it somehow manages to capture the classic Metroid gameplay- find powerups, unlock and explore new areas, and defeat minibosses. The controls are unique, but they're going to take some getting used to for old-school Metroid gamers. They aren't very intuitive- for example, you can't aim up or down while moving, so you have to stand still while you look around. This is perhaps one of the few games where the simplistic nature of the Gamecube's controller does a game a disservice- the PS2 controller, for example, would have been well-utilized for Metroid Prime.  But you get used to the controls after a few hours of play. Combat is pretty simple, the lock-on system of the newer Zelda games has been adopted. Combat isn't as much about dodging and being a good twitch player as much as it is about finding your enemies weak points. That's good and bad, but intense combat has never really been a part of the Metroid games, its always been about recognizing patterns and weaknesses. The levels are all huge and gorgeously detailed. There are a bunch of different environments, and the tried and true Metroid method of doubling back once you have the rockets, bombs, grapple beam, etc. to reach previously inaccessible areas is very enjoyable (well, to me at least). The special effects- humidity on your helmet's visor, flashes reflecting your face off the inside of your helmet, great looking explosions, all add a lot of detail to the game. The sound effects are wonderful, and the music is a mix of some new tracks and updated of the classic Metroid tracks. The plot is played out mostly through your scan visor- you can scan enemies, both living and dead, and objects to see what the nefarious space pirates are up to. Fans of the Metroid universe will probably enjoy the many revelations about Samus' past. The game isn't without its flaws, however. For example, Metroid games have a pretty basic formula- land ship, find out what the space pirates are mutating this time, escape before base/ship/planet explodes. It wouldn't have hurt the designers to do something different in terms of plot this time considering the ever-growing breadth of the Metroid universe, but the sheer playability and atmospheric detail of the game help overcome the paper-thin, overused plot. Definite Game of the Year contender.	1
Smooth and seamless, the game transitions from one stage to the next without a single second of load time at all.  The game graphics are without a doubt one of the best to date, with several million polygons used for every character you see... all fully 3d, and moving well above a constant 60 frames a second without any signs of slowdown.  It's obvious that the developers put an incredible amount of work into the detail of the environment- easily the most atmospheric of any game i've played, there isn't a single corner that hasn't been intricately hand crafted to perfection.  The game play is surprisingly smooth and unlike any first person shooter, but instead plays more along the platform genre where jumps are done easily and the controls are fairly intuitive without much of an emphasis on shooting skills like your typical doom game.  Definitely a top notch adventure game that I will continue to be glued to for the next two weeks.	1
Metroid Prime is amazing in the way it completely captures the feel of the originals for NES and SNES and translates it into 3D. But even though the gameplay feels familiar, it's a totally new experience. First, if you've played the in-store demo, don't let its ease fool you. For one thing, I think the enemies in the first level actually hit quite a bit harder in the final game than they do in the demo. For another, it gets harder shortly after that level. Second, like others have said, this isn't a shooting game where your only goal is to wipe out anything that moves. It's mostly about exploration, figuring out what to do and how to get to the places that seem out of reach. Along the way there are plenty of enemies to get in your way, from hunched-over space pirates with decent AI (not as good as some dedicated FPS games, but they'll duck and cover, and hide behind things) to swarms of insects to enormous beasts. Third, the little details in the game are really something special. When you look upwards in the rain, little water droplets land on your visor, and when you jump out of a pool, your visor even fogs up briefly! I just got it and can't put it down. If you don't own a GameCube, you need to get one so you can play Metroid Prime. If you do own one, why are you reading this instead of playing?	1
Samus Aran has finally returned after a eight year hiatus and boy, was the wait worth it.  Metroid Prime is a first-person adventure game. Don't get it confused with a game like Halo or other first-person shooters because the emphasise of this game is on exploration, like in all Metroid games. Yes, you'll still be shooting at things but you'll also spend an equal amount of time running through the interiors and exteriors of the world of Tallon IV, which brings me to my next point. A game such as Metroid Prime wouldn't be as convincing if the game didn't have surreal graphics. Guess what? It does. The graphics are extremely detailed and the texture work is crisp and clear, which is a good thing as the game will pull you out of reality and into the world of Tallon IV. The sound in Metroid Prime is extremely well done as well. Although it lacks voice acting, the game makes up for that through the intense sound effects. Everything from the changing of weapons to the enemies on-screen is eerily convincing. Also, the music in the game is done by the original Nintendo development team that worked on the original Metroid games, which means that the music will definately live up to the Metroid name. Many people believe that graphics make up a game but I stand with the others that believe that gameplay does. Metroid Prime has excellent gameplay mechanics and the controls are easy to learn too. No, the controls are nothing like typical FPS games which require you to manipulate two joysticks at the same time. This game uses a control scheme similar to that of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. This control scheme is really effective for an adventure game such as this. Metroid Prime is the game to get for Nintendo GameCube! It packs about 20 hours of gameplay on the disc, and that's just the amount of time you'll spend beating the game. Add on top of that the special features that become available when you have both Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion for the Game Boy Advance and link them up. Get this, one of the extras is the original Metroid game... The original that started the whole Metroid saga. Metroid Prime is a really great game and it doesn't hurt that it's also one of the highest rated GameCube games out now. One should not miss the chance to own this for its appeal has no age limitations. Five Stars!	1
This game alone is good enough reason to buy the GameCube, if you don't already have one. I myself consider Super Metroid one of the greatest games of all time, and I was wondering all these years when a follow-up would arrive. After eight years, the wait was finally over. Mertoid Prime isn't really a sequel, since it takes place between the events of the first Metroid and Metroid II. Basically, Samus lands on a frigate in high orbit over Tallon IV. She realizes that the Space Pirates are up to no good, so she (for anyone who didn't know, Samus is female) investigates, and when the ship is about to explode, she sees an old nemesis. Upon landing at Tallon IV, she investigates further, learning more about the Pirates' plans, the Chozo, and other things. The Space Pirates' master plan: to use a mutagen called Phazon to enhance their ranks and create stronger forces. The Graphics are so polished and so good that you'll think it was Metroid all over again. It's only up close that the quality falters, but it's negligable. The game also supports Dolby Pro Logic II, which is as good as its Digital counterpart, and also supports progressive scan. The control mechanics aren't hard to master, and are somewhat based on the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. You'll be using the Scan Visor a lot. You have to in order to get the best ending. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City needs to step aside. I can understand why it and GTA III were so successful, but, was anyone even paying attention to the graphics? I've seen graphics like that on the N64. This game is an instant classic, and has the potential to be the greatest game of all time.	1
If you are a World War II buff and love flight simulators, Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator - WWII Europe Series is for you. Using the same attention to detail as in its Flight Simulator series - indeed, you can import "worlds" from the civilian game to this war one - Combat Flight Simulator allows you to fly in two Campaigns, The Battle of Britain and The Battle for Europe, as a pilot in the RAF, Luftwaffe, or USAAF (U.S. Army Air Forces). Combat Flight Simulator - Europe lets you fly many of the famous fighters in service in those three air forces. If you fly as a British pilot, you can expect to be at the controls of a Hawker Hurricane Mk. (Mark) I, a Supermarine Spitfire Mk. I, or a later variant, the Mk. IX.  As a German pilot, you'll fly either the Messerchmitt Bf 109E or the Focke-Wulf Fw. 190A fighters.  Finally, as a Yank in the USAAF, you'll man either the sturdy P-47D Thunderbolt or the sleek P-51 Mustang.  All of these planes have their strengths and weaknesses, so try to read the manual (or the Help files) and do a bit of research before you hook up the joystick and take flight.  Particularly challenging are the ammunition load limits to each plane; each plane has its own ammo load capacity, and players more familiar with fighter jet simulations (such as Microprose's famous F-15 Strike Eagle series) may find themselves shooting away all their ammo at one plane (if they choose realistic presets) and then being unable to shoot at anyone else because they have no bullets.  I would advise rookie pilots to use Unlimited Ammo settings until they have had enough practice to shoot down enemy bombers and fighters without wasting precious rounds. The simulation not only has the two Campaigns I mentioned earlier, but it has Free Flight, Quick Combat, Single Mission, and Training modes.  Quick Combat, particularly, is good for players who like both flight simulations and arcade games.  This option lets you choose what and how many enemy planes you can face off against, where the fight takes place, what weather conditions are like, time of day, and tactical situation.  The enemy comes at you in waves, like in an arcade game, and as soon as you dispatch one wave, another appears.  The challenge here is to shoot down as many planes as you can before you either run out of gas or are shot down. (Unlimited Ammo should be your choice in this sort of game no mater how good you are, unless you can shoot down one plane with one bullet.  Here, skills learned in a jet fighter simulation will not help you!) For players weaned on jet fighter games, it would be advisable to use the non-1940s HUD (Heads Up Display) view option.  I (since I am new to this game myself) still use it in the Campaign mode since the "Cockpit" view option, while more realistic, is still a bit overwhelming to me.  Purists and/or experienced pilots can set realism to 100% to their heart's content, but casual players or rookies should start out easy then gradually increase the realism settings. The graphics are excellent, even for a 1998-era game.  Being a Microsoft game it runs on most Windows platforms except 3.1, and I am sure no one reading this review still has that operating system.  I particularly like the "worlds" depicted: you actually get a sense of flying over 1940s Europe.  The sound is also good, and you can even hear your fellow pilots' radio calls. (Like the more advanced flight simulations, the Single Mission and Campaign games are very realistic in that you fly with a squadron, something I never experienced in F-15 Strike Eagles I-III.  I did once own Microprose's F-14 Fleet Defender, a game that had AI wingmen, but I could never get it to run on any of my machines!) Microsoft also offers a Pacific series counterpart, which I am hoping to get soon.  Check to see if they have expansion kits.  Many simulations ranging from flight to Star Wars starfighter games have them, and I believe Combat Flight Simulator is no exception. Oh, yes. Good luck, happy landings, and good hunting!	1
Metroid Prime is a AWESOME game to play on the Nintendo GameCube ***THIS IS A MUST HAVE GAME TO BUY*** I give it 5 Stars "Highly Recommended" REALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO BUY and play this game on Nintendo GameCube	1
It appears that the evil Space Pirates are up to their devious ways once again, only this time something has gone horribly wrong. Samus was called in to investigate and she arrives on the scene to find a disabled Space Pirate ship floating above the planet Tallon IV. With little to go on, Samus must venture forth and attempt to get to the bottom of things. Her adventure begins as she enters a mysterious derelict spaceship. Traverse a crippled spaceship and explore the vast worlds of Tallon IV in an all-new first-person perspective! Take advantage of Samus's many powers using new suits that enable her to gain new abilities and revisit earlier worlds to uncover many hidden secrets. Master Samus's combat, scan, and visors -- elements crucial to your success. Explore each area to find many familiar weapons, such as the Wave Beam and Freeze Beam, and some all-new ones as well. Choose the right weapon or ability carefully for the situation at hand. Samus will need to use all of the suit and visor abilities as well as many specialized weapons to navigate deadly Tallon IV.	1
I had the priviledge of playing a couple of hours of Metroid Prime, and I liked what I saw. The game began with Samus on an outside platform. Thousands of asteroids were flying across the sky, and she could go to a clear spot on the platform and shoot them. Ultimately, however, she needed to search her surroundings for hidden devices that would open the doors of the structure. The adventure doesn't really begin until Samus enters the building. This game has all kinds of terrain to explore--including some very Turok-esque jungles. These are huge places.  I have no idea how long it will take people to finish the game, but I'm betting better than 60 hours. Seen through Samus's visor, Metroid Prime is every bit as much about exploration and puzzle solving as it is about shooting. Samus's visor includes a window that exposes hidden signs and symbols. Once you uncover these clues, it is up to you to figure out how to arrange them to unlock door and find hidden items. Metroid Prime's camera shifts to the third-person perspective when Samus curls up in a ball and rolls places. She rolls through tunnels that are otherwise too small to explore. By placing explosives on the ground, she can bounce her balled-up self to reach elevated tunnels. The game also has these really nifty half-pipe areas.  Once you find the right explosives, you can launch Samus over the top of the half-pipes to reach otherwise inaccessible ledges. Per past Metroid games, Metroid Prime has plenty of creepy vermin to kill. Thanks to the first-person perspective, Metroid Prime does not suffer the irritating camera problems that have plagued so many of the latest 3D games. You are inside Samus's helmet, so you see what she sees. Better look quickly, though. When the action gets going, outer space thingies will come at you from all directions. The art direction in this game is excellent beyond belief. I doubt that any PlayStation 2 game will ever reach this level of graphic quality. This even rivals Halo--and that is saying a lot. The big complaint about Metroid Prime is that played from the first-person perspective, it cannot possibly have the same search-and-explore feel as earlier games--particularly Super Metroid for the Super Nintendo. This was a fair concern--but Nintendo guards its franchises carefully and Retro Studios has been true to the original vision. Metroid Prime does have that perfect blend of explore and shoot. Actually, for those of you who play PC games, Metroid Prime feels a little--and I did say a little--like System Shock II from Looking Glass. If you played System Shock II as a naval officer instead of a spy or a marine, it was about exploring and setting traps and hacking into systems. The weakness in this comparison is that the navy guy in System Shock II could not strap on anti-gravity boots or swing across ceilings--Samus does. System Shock II was brilliant in its sci fi reality and its feeling of danger. Metroid Prime has a more powerful fantasy element. I, obviously, have not had the chance to finish the game, but I love this game. I absoultely love it.	1
Although there are a few glitches with some systems (a patch is due in February) this is a further joy if you liked CFS1 and CFS2.  Be aware though that this is tactical air war, your job in this sim is to terrorize the ground.  Dogfighting is still there but it is secondary to the main mission, destroying the enemy with tactical air support. The aircraft are beautiful and the personalized nose art and squadron letters is a nice touch.  Ground targets, pre and post destruction, are the best ever. There are a few tantalizing too late in real life but intriguing historical planes such as the first jets.  ONly the Me262 actually got into combat but the unbelievabley advanced Gotha jet is in here as well as the British Vampire and American P80.  The sim allows you to try and find out 'what if' these aircraft had shown up a little sooner. The CFS tactical display is still the best way to 'see' what's around you without a lot of view shifting and it's there again.  CFS just gets better and better.	1
Things are often very relative in the gaming world. If CFS3 was actually Microsoft's first shot at a combat sim, it probably would merrit much higher reviews from the simming community and myself. After all, the game does boast an interesting campaign engine, a good variety of different planes to fly, including bombers and prototypical aircraft, some nice atmospheric effects, and the ability to man different positions on the bombers. Of course, many of these pro's have already been implemented in other WW2 combat sims of years past. Unfortunately, this is not Microsoft's first shot and those of us who have loyally followed their series of flight sims, both combat and civilian, expect a certain progression with each new release. I, myself, was extremely pleased with said progression in both FS2002 and CFS2. Both games, I felt, learned from the mistakes of their predecessors, but at the same time, remained faithful to the series. And both greatly enhanced the look and feel of flight simming while not expecting too much from the machines they ran on. This is where CFS3 fails in my eyes. So here are my major beefs. Graphics: Where did they dream up this graphics engine? It looks and feels more like a first-person shooter than a flight sim. Is this really CFS3 or am I playing Counterstrike on a very wacky map? Sure it has nice clouds, but this game just does not have the visual cohesiveness of FS2002 nor CFS2. The virtual cockpits just don't look as good as in CFS2. The ground objects are also out of proportion to the aircraft. Do a little low-level strafing and things just don't look right. Performance: My biggest gripe. If this new graphics engine was supposed to provide better performance by utilizing the video card more, they blew it. I have a P4 1.9ghz, 512mb rambus, with a TI4600 128mb Geforce4 and, with NO programs running in the background, the game stutters - especially when firing the guns. UNACCEPTABLE. The game just doesn't look good enough to justify such a drop in performance. Damage models: These were supposed to be greatly improved. If so, I don't see it. Every plane I have shot down follows the same annoying pattern: pour tons of rounds into any part you like and eventually the whole plane blows up. No pieces of wings falling off, no tails detaching, no engines blowing, just one big boom. Would someone please go back to 1998 and look at the damage models in Activision's Fighter Sqadron? They did it right. AI: I am getting so sick of computer pilots that have the uncanny ability - even as novices - to maintain control and maneuverability of their aircraft when you have damaged them, when one little hit on your alieron from their guns renders your aircraft unflyable. Selection of aircraft: It was very thoughtful of Microsoft to include some oddball prototypical aircraft in their selection, but why oh why, at the expense of planes like the B17, Do17, He111, Ju87, and ME110? This is Europe, right? Oh, and thanks for the lack of compatibility with CFS2 aircraft. Yes, all my griping makes the game sound a lot worse than it actually is, but with all the used copies of CFS3 I've seen on auction sites and the number of bad reviews it's gotten from other users like myself, I think it's obvious that Microsoft has made a boo-boo or two on this one. Let's pray they don't use this graphics engine on FS2004.	-1
One star is generous.  This sim, and I have them all, is a travesty to the genre.  After 4 long days of tinkering with this sim I finally gave up and took it back.  I so wanted this game to be a worthy successor to the CFS franchise but it would seem that they have taken a step backwards.  With sim's like Il-2 Sturmovik out there Microsoft had there work cut out for them.  Over at the message boards for the flight simulation community this "game" is taking quite a bit of heat.  For the time being I would hold off on purchasing this title and wait and see if they develop a patch.  Not Recommended!	-1
This game is great its fun and easy to get into graphics are really good game play is hot ground level is amazing trees are not 2D thank you now the bad this game take a really good pc to run it lots of ram and a geforce 4 ti or something to get the best graphics and performnce out of this game if u get this game or have this game turn down the graphics to 2 and see if it looks differnt then when u have the graphic at 3 if u get or have the game u will know what i mean but other than that the game is hard core sim fan might not like it as much cuz it can feel like an arcade game at times but who care the game is fun i think u should use a 1.2ghz or higher	1
While games like WIPEOUT FUSION try to get it right, QUANTUM REDSHIFT nips it in the bud and nails WIPEOUT FUSION to the wall(in every aspect). The GRAPHICS, GAME PLAY, FRAME-RATE(not a lick of slow down @ 60 FRAMES PER SECOND), WEAPONS, CONTROL, TRACK DESIGN, are all better than WIPEOUT FUSION by a country mile. The graphics are simply amazing, the explosions have awesome shock waves(which don't create any slow down) and the buildings, water and surroundings are all beautiful. There is this amazing water effect when you're in 1st person mode that is darn near 'STATE OF THE ART'. There is a couple of games that come close to this 1st person-water effect, one is EXTREME-G3 on the PS2(it's a harder-later race at night and it is raining. Really cool water effect in 1st person mode)and the other is TEST DRIVE on the original playstation(I believe it is the 'Russia' track and it too is raining, again, really neat water effect in 1st person mode. BY THE WAY, that game has awesome crashes!) Other than that I haven't seen any really neat water effects in 1st person mode racer games like QUANTUM REDSHIFT has.  You'll see what I'm talking about, it's AMAZING! There is also a really neat effect I noticed while watching my replays. Some of the stationary cameras shake violently as the racers are blazing by. I love that touch and this game is full of little things like that. I can't really say enough about how pleased I am with this game...HOWEVER, there is a couple of NEGATIVE's though, but really don't take away from the game play itself. One is that the tracks seem a little short for my liking. I wish I could adjust the number of laps in QUICK RACE mode to make up for that, but there is sadly no option.(but, in it's defense, the harder the race you choose the more laps there are, but I still have no control over that PRE-SET number). ALSO, I don't think that the track "IN REVERSE" should be counted as a "SEPERATE TRACK". It says there are 16 tracks, will really there are 8, in both directions(8X2=16, NOT! It's really 8 tracks FORWARD and REVERSE. But, in it's defense, I haven't completed the game and there may be surprise extra tracks, but that's not likely the case). ALSO the short skits when the rivals are squaring off with each other are, for the most part, pointless and a waiste of valuable storage space(perhaps more tracks could have been added?). Other than that I LOVE THIS GAME. Heck, I can't emagine any race fan NOT liking this game! But some people like to sleep during their racing experience and...that's okay, however, if you are into SNOOZER race games like PROJECT GOTHAM(which I actually like, it just gets boring, very fast), or SEGA GT(no comment) this game may be too exciting for you. But if you like FAST PACED, HIGH SPEED, SHOOT'em UP, FUTURISTIC, COOL WEAPONS, COOL EXPLOSIONS, FLASHY TRACKS, ANTI-GRAVITY-POD RACER TYPE racing games then this game is for you.  To put it simply...THIS GAME IS A MUST!!!	1
The graphics are excellent. An extremely fun game to play. The bad part of this game is when you're racing at high speeds and wander off the track the game automatically resets your craft,very irritating. Overall I would prefer Extreme G3 on PS2.	1
Quantum Redshift starts off hard--almost frustratingly so.  It took me nine or ten races to even get out of last place (although I started at the second difficulty level, not the lowest).  Once you get a feeling for the speed of the game, which is almost dizzying at first, you improve rapidly, but I've never found myself dominating a race as I can in so many other racing games (where you eventually get so good, you lap the other cars five times before the race ends).  QR also keeps a carrot dangling in front of you--as you win, you get money to upgrade your car, and you unlock other pilots/cars (you can't mix and match different pilots with different cars, though), new difficulty levels, and new tracks.  Also, a selection of easter eggs opens up as you win, including my favorite, which turns off the weapons and forces you to win a race on your driving skill alone.  You can pick and choose among these easter eggs at any time other than during a specific race (so even between races in the tournament mode). Contrary to some of the other reviews here, this is a very pretty game, which uses the power of the Xbox quite well.  The tracks are varied--some are fairly level, high speed tracks, others are bumpy and set your car bouncing up and down until you learn to control and take advantage of the bumps and jumps.  The cars also have a very different feel to them: some are nimble and agile, but not speed burners, others are fast but difficult to handle, others are ponderous but powerful, and others are a mix.  I believe I have unlocked all the cars, and have a choice between 16 of them. There are some problems, but these are manageable.  Loading times for the tracks are too long, and compounded by the fact that a cut-scene featuring your character and the home pilot of the track you're on always comes up first (and takes a while to load itself).  The music is also bland, uninspired techno, but QR does support the Xbox's custom soundtrack feature, so you can use your own music if you want. Quite simply, this is a wonderful game that hasn't gotten a lot of attention.  Once you push through to your first victory, you'll be hooked.	1
The legend continues as Activision brings out it's newest installment in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. Unlike it's predeccessor (don't think I spelled that right), the latest installment has a HUGE gap between #4 and #3. In this version, when you start career mode there is NO time clock what so ever! You are free to roam the level as much as you like, but when you stop and ask or talk to someone, they give you an objective to complete, THEN the time clock starts. The goals varies, sometimes it's to stop a security guard from busting all your skate buddies to copying another skater's tricks to the infamous S-K-A-T-E or C-O-M-B-O goal. And the level design is VERY realistic. no more is there a perfectly smooth sidewalk, now you can see that there are scratches, bumps and even scrapes and openings in the sidewalk. The levels also are very realistic as well. There won't be halfpipes and ramps all in the middle of the road. For example, in the College level, there are no (like I said) halfpipes or ramps or rails right smack in the middle of the street. The game is based on real life. And when you get all level goals for a level with a character, they bring in their own ramp or halfpipe or object to add to the level. And the cheats...well you have to find them out yourself. To sum this game up, a perfect ten, no flaws what so ever. If you want a good sports game this year for Christmas, this is it. Strap on your helmet and pads, it's gonna be a bumpy ride...	1
I bought it to go with my complete set of Tony Hawk video games for the PS2. It went well with my set.	1
Well, people expect too much of this game but i can say that it is a huge jump from the classic 2 minute mode where you've to do tasks to an open escenario where you've to find the tasks to do (21 on every level) and every skater has his own final pro challenge that makes the game longer 'cause you want to see the other skaters "ending".  I can say that this game is just part of the history of TH, if you look back to the amazing and incredible THPS 3 you'll see a great game, excellent graphics and incredible soundtrack, but it has the simplicity of the old TH games from PS1, but the game received the score of 10 over 10 in most magazines and game websites, you can check gamespot or ign if you don't believe me, 'cause when the game came out it was like the most incredible game ever created (and i found that only 4 or 5 games on all the history of PS2 have received the Perfect score), and this game is no exception, of course that if you've played TH underground 1 or 2 you'll find a lack of history here, but the game is great anyways and is a step on the ladder, but it has a lot of challenges and tasks to do, and i can assure you that after you play this game a lot, and after you beat it, there will always be something that you couldn't do and you'll find yourself playing this game after years (it happened to me) 'cause somebody told you that you have to bother the elephant to open the aquarium in the zoo (i replayed it after beating TH underground and in the middle  of TH underground 2 just to open the aquarium and it was incredibly satisfactory to do it).  This is part of the ladder of TH, part of the history, if some people think that this game is over rated or it isn't a good game, well, i think they don't see the true value behind this title, but as a collector and a huge fan of the TH series i can tell you buy this game before you see it in a friend's house or in a rental and with a great desire check to buy it and see the terrible world "unavaliable", i think you can trust me on this. I almost pay 80 bucks for the collectors item "THPS3" just when the gentle people of activision put the game again on the streets for 17 bucks, you can check my review on THPS 3 for the whole story.	1
Tony Hawk 4 is the best PS2 game I've ever played. It's about a million times better than Tony Hawk 3 and Tony hawk 2. I've had this game for 2 years and I just can't stop playing it. Even though there's Tony Hawk Underground, Tony Hawk Underground 2, and American Wasteland, I haven't bought them I know they can't beat this game.  Graphics: I know everyone says the graphics could be better, I still think they're great, especially for a game made that long ago. I probably think this because alomst all of my 52 PS2 games were made at least a year ago. These graphics are better thanthose in sly 3 and thats a brand new game.  Multiplayer: Good enough. Horse is fun and playing online is too. King of the hill is my favorite and trick attack is good also.  Cheats: If you type in watch_me_xplode at the beginning it will give you all of the cheats, levels, and skaters. Most of the cheats stink but Perfect rail, manual, and skitch, cool specials, hoverboard, flame, and stats 13 are really useful. I beat the game the first time without cheats and then I beat again with cheats, the first time took me a month. I think I beat it the second time in 2 days.  Levels:  Colledge: a fun and easy level with lots of vert and street stuff  San Fransisco: Bleh. I don't like this level because it has way too many open spaces and street stuff.  Alcatraz: My favorite level, cool challenges, high rails, it's a vert level  Kona: Better than San Francisco, very street, hard challenges, an ok level.  Shipyard: ohhh this level is so bad it hurts to play it. impossible challenges and way too much water.  London: a good mix of street and vert, pretty easy.  Zoo: I love zoo. My 2nd favorite level. fun challenges, another great mix of street and vert  The levels you have to buy  Carnival: Some fun challenges, otherwise a lot like shipyard  Chicago: this level is so hard you cant even do it with cheats. Otherwise pretty fun.  Characters: Most of them are pretty good. Unlock Jango Fett and they'll all seem like toddlers that are desperatly trying to skateboard. Created players are fun to use because you can give them any tricks you want. Even Jango Fett's. Even though Tony Hawk is the best skater you can use (without cheats) his pro challenge at the end of the game is pretty hard, just a warning. Jamie Thomas's pro challenge is so easy a 2 year old could do it, no offence to those of you who are stuck on it. There are different names for created characters that will do different things to them. One of these names is kraken, try it out.  Create-a-park: So fun, so addicting. I spent all of today building parks. If you are going to play against your friend, you can make the park so you have the advantage. Better than playing at a normal park, especially shipyard.  If you want to buy this game, I encourage you to because it is truly a great game	1
This is the newest Tony hawk Pro Skater game (Not counting Tony Hawks Underground) In this game you get to play as one of the following: Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Glifburg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska,  Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer, and they even brought back Bob Burnquist! You can also play as a custom player. (My personal favorite is Rodney Mullen) Unlike the first 3 THPS games, in this one you don't have a time limit to do the objectives! Instead, you just skate up to people and press circle around them and they will ask you to do something. If you don't complete the objective you just press start and choose "Retry Last Goal" and you can try it again, saving time and not having to restart the level. I really like the levels in this game. they are challenging and fun. I love the music in this game too, in fact, one of the songs is by my favorite band!  There's not much they could do to make it better. It's got great replay value, because you'll want to beat the game with each player! And you could just go for a free ride if you don't feel like doing objectives. I think this is the best THPS game so far. 10/10	1
Well... I like this game unlike these other people who just don't know what the heck they're talking about. It's better than THPS3 and I like THPS3 alot. I hope this review was helpful.	1
Let me start off by saying that I love tony hawk video games.  Ever since the first came out i had practiced at it and got really good.  I had tony hawk 2 and 3 on reserve and got them the day they came out.  It got better and better.  Then came 4....  Well the graphics are good, but that is NOT everyting.  I hate the fact that there is no two minute runs.  I like that because i would love to try getting as many objectives done in the time given and even if i did no objectives, i would love getting a high score.  But in this one u can do all the tricks u want and it will not matter.  And u have to find people to do your objectives.  And i heard it was rediculously hard at some points.  A challenge is good, but a game like this is about having fun getting high scores and opening cheats and hidden characters, not getting pissed off at a dumb objective.  My advice, if u have a ps2,gc,or xbox buy tony hawk 3, u will love it.  And if u have an older system, then buy tony hawk 2.  Don't waste time buying tony hawk 4, its not worth it.	-1
This is a very cool game I would have rated it 5 stars but I played it after underground. And undergound was better but this is still a sweet game. It's coooooooooooooooooooooooool!	1
The levels are awesome and so are the graphics. Better goal set up and the goals are funner and the minigames are addicting. Very unrealistic, but it wouldn't be fun if it was realistic. Very hard and the additions make the game worth a look even if you hated the first 3. good sound trak. I hate that you have to find the people to do their goals.	1
this game is good i have had this for xbox and i think the ps2 verision is much better than xbox so get this game if u love skating	1
Very cool game, and I'm not a skater. A little frustrating at first, but you'll be doing fine in no time. Recommended.	1
On the surface, THPS4 seems like a perfect sequel to a series widely regarded by skaters and non-skaters alike as one of the best in all of gaming. There's a huge slew of changes to the formula that aren't really evolutions in the vein of the revert and manual, but slight touch-ups on a formula that nears perfection. No longer do you have to repeat the same goals with all skaters: completing a goal with one pro completes it with all. Meanwhile, pro challenges, which are goals specific to each skater, will ensure you take all the skaters for a spin. Add in the elimination of the dreaded clock, an improved create-a-skater mode, and one of the best soundtracks in recent history, and this game seems like a sure bet, right? Well, yes, but it's not as great as all the hype and praise may lead you to believe. The biggest problem with Tony 4 is that the career mode, with 190 goals, is a great evolutionary step in the way of Aggressive Inline, but many of the goals have little to nothing to do with what made the series great to begin with. While the other 3 Hawks were more or less action games, this one seems more like a "sit back, explore, chill" kind of thing. It's still a good game, but I went in expecting a continuation of the series, and found instead a title that seems almost like a different one all together. One more thing of note is the intro of the spine transfer: there's no real use for it, and it seems like the move was thrown in along the "we have to have a new move in this sequel, too" line of thinking. Since this game is multiplatform, the differences should be discussed: While XBox does have cleaner graphics and custom soundtracks, the PS2 features tighter control and online play. It's up to you to decide which of these features is most important. No matter what version of the game you opt to buy, THPS 4 is a worthy sequel to a series that has stood the test of time. It just happens to be a lot different from the other entries.	1
I couldn't believe it until I saw it.  The THPS series had managed to add new stuff to an already overloaded series as it was.  This is a major improvement over 3, despite the fact that all THPS games are great.  I found that the first 3 games were insanely easy, but this one, barring the first 3 areas(college, San Fransisco, and Alcatraz) was at least mildly difficult.  And once you got 90 Pro Points after completing tasks, you got to do pro challenges, possible the hardest objectives one could concieve(with one or two exceptions like the Chad Muska objective, etc.)  Then, after beating your first Pro Challenge, you get to really put your skills to the test with the red objectives.  These things can get insanely difficult, but all objectives are rewarding as the give you cash as you work your way to new skateboards, secret skaters, and secret locations.  It was also a good thing that they took away the option to buy special tricks, as I always found that to be somewhat annoying as you wasted money on a trick, then it turns out to be a total dissapointment.  You also no longer have to buy stats, as some objectives reward them to you.  The usual options are great, and they added a multiplayer free skate along with the other usual goodies.  This also has to be the greatest soundtrack ever to grace a videogame, even beating out Midnight Club 2.  Simply put: buy this game, or at least rent it.  You won't regret it.	1
Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 is an awesome evolution of the series. It is probably the most complete of all of the TH games. The newest feature is online play. You can play online in many different mini games. The one player game has been changed as well. Now there is no timer on the goal and missions. It is similar to the format used in "Agressive Online". The goals are also more inventive than in the past. THPS4 has added features like street luge and car skitching, and even tennis with a skateboard. The skate park editor makes a return appearance as well and does not dissapoint. You can also upload and download skate parks with other people on the website(if you have a PS2 internet adaptor). The graphics, gameplay, and physics are all pretty much the same as past installments of the game. The reason I don't give this game 5 stars is my tilt. I have simply grown tired of the series. When me and my friend first played the original Tony Hawk I was blown away. Since then each sequeal, while improving greatly in each installment, has jsut been less and less magical to me. Some series I never tire of but this one I do. They should wait longer before making the sequeals in my opinion. Nevertheless it is a great undertaking for skateboarding fans and regular gamers. If you loved the TH series and want another sequeal then you will love it. If you have grown tired of the series like me, you still may want to pick it up for the online play, and skate park swapping. Either way you will not be dissapointed.	1
Put simply, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 gives you more freedom than ever before, wild mini games, extreme objectives, and full Online Play.  Definately worth buying.	1
This game is very nice to look at; the skaters all handle in a realistic manner, and the levels are pretty large and varied. There's a nice all-encompassing 'unlock all' cheat (watch_me_xplode) that makes all levels and skaters available without actually completing all the challenges. One thing that nobody here really mentions is that although skating about trying your hand at a series of small frustrating challenges is fun for a while, the main attraction for me is the 2 player function. There's a wealth of different game modes, but for me the most entertainment is the simple game of chasing (called Slap) which is great fun once you've become familiar with the skate parks (although the collision detection is a little iffy.. "Got you! Whaaaat?!? You got me?!?") Anyway, top purchase and the best of the series.	1
I had played a demo of this game, that offered about half of the first level.  And having been a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater fan since the very first game came out on Playstation 1, I didn't know what to expect from the new career mode.  After playing the demo I was a little disappointed.  Sure, the skating was as wonderful as ever, and the level design was still pure genius, but there was something about the new career mode that bugged me.   In case you did not know, the career mode for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is much different from the first three games in the series.  It is basically a Free Skate until you talk to one of many characters in the levels that will give you goals, lots of which are similar to goals in the first three games, but many of which are new.   Anyway, after renting the game and playing through it I am pleased to say that the new career mode is awesome.  Once given a chance, it is truly amazing, and almost all of the level objectives are extremely entertaining.  The objectives do get incredibly difficult about half way through though, and it'll be tough completing all of them, but hang in there, because its worht it.  A gem.	1
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is awesome. The gameplay is cool. The graphics are realistic. It's extremely challanging and very addictive. It features plenty of neat stuff such as cheats, tricks, hidden skaters, different levels, and more. Unfortunatly, as good as this game is, it does have its cons. For one thing, the music soundtrack is awful. Also, some of the goals are extremely difficult, even if you have all the cheats in the game. The time is a real thorn in the side. Infact, speaking of time, there are some goals in the game that must be completed in a matter of 10 to 20 seconds, or else you'll fail it. That stinks! But most of the time they give you 2 minutes. Plus, this game should've had more levels and cheats than it did. Where's the Level Select code? And where in the heck are the special 2 player challanges? Anyway, this is not a bad game. It's very hard at times, but is still cool. I recommend this game for experts only. It does require a lot of patience and intellegence. Instead of collecting tapes you're having to collect money. You use the money to buy your way through the game. That's the object, and it can be exhausting.	1
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is the 4th title in this amazing series. The game features full comppatibilty with Sony's Network Adapter, allowing you to play online againist other skaters. The mission style is al together different that the previous games. This time around you explore the level and meet up with people that assign you goals, instead of the goals being preassigned. Overall it is an excellent game, except for one some-what serious flaw; why in the world are the graphics still the same as they were in in Tony Hawk 3? I just do not understand this. Other than that it is an excellent game that should keep you entertained for quite some time.	1
This title is better than Tony Hawk 3, but alot harder. Activision 2 should have added a two player career mode. It would have made the game alot more fun. The tricks are awesome, alot of them are from the original Tony Hawk's. I am mostly a street skate boarder, I hate vert. I can't get a good 100,000+ combo with vert, with grinding and using manuals I can. Once you get to the shipyard the game gets hella lot harder. Shipyard suxors too. Some "missions" in the game are too hard to accomplish, with which I've tried over and over. If your new at this type of gameplay, it will take some time to get use to it. I would reccomend this to anyone of any age (Parents cough) Soundtrack needs ALOT of help (cough activision). The only bands or groups I have heard of on there is System of a Down, AC/DC and Iron Maiden.	1
With Tony Hawk's 4th game, Neversoft realized that enough people have been playing thier games to take the difficulty a step up. Thats definately what they did, this game is much harder than THPS3, it was obvious Neversoft did not take the extra time to make sure this game was newcomer-friendly. Other than that, the game was quite good. I want to start off by saying I think that the soundtrack in THPS4 is pretty bad, the problem is that it does not have a lot of punk rock, which is, in my opinion, true skating music, I really don't like rap, and I think skating rap really don't mix.  It seemed that after the first game, the music got really bad. I still think that the first had the best music, it featured some music from some really great skater-punk bands, and had no rap. Soundtrack aside, the graphics are pretty good. They are a little different than THPS3, not much improvement, but they are better, the skater animations have a bit of a noticable change, there are some new animations for landing tricks. Depending on what the trick was and how well you landed, there will be a different animation. The tricks all look smoother too, grind balancing looks more realistic as does spining, and flip tricks look more natural. The biggest refinement would be in the career mode, which has been improved a lot. The two minute timer is gone, and goals are now done by traveling around to different people in the level. They will ask you to do specific goals which will usually have thier own time limit. Some of the same goals from the last game are here too, like high scores and collecting S-K-A-T-E.  The rest of the goals are much harder for the most part, I often found myself have to retry a goal over 15 times. But the goals are usually really fun, so it won't get too frustrating. The control scheme is a bit different as well. At the core it is the same, but new tricks have been added. In THPS3, pressing the flip button twice or three times while doing a kickflip, heelflip, or shuv-it would multiply it by 2 or 3. This time, that is also effective with Hardflips, Varial flips, and inward heelflips. This can also work with grabs, giving you many more grab tricks, which makes for many more trick variations. So all in all, another solid addition to the already great series. Would I reccomend this game to newcomers of the series? No. This game is stictly for the veterans, as it's goals are much harder and almost demand prior knowledge of how the game plays. Newcomers, you should go with THPS3, that is the best game all around in the series so far, its goals are more simple, and it offers a tutorial. But long-time fans of the series should definately pick this one up, it will keep you satisfied and you should be welcome to the challenge.	1
This Winter, two games were released I had been looking forward to; Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (of course), and this, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. After playing Tony Hawk 3 over and over and over again on Free Skate (I had beaten everything on Career), I was getting pretty sick of the same levels. FINALLY, number 4 has come. The second release of this series for the "new generation" systems, Tony Hawk 4 once again expands itself seemingly as far as it can go; at least until 5 will arrive. A few minor additions have been made; stiching cars, busses, ect, massive, literally massive levels, new secret characters (such as Iron Maiden's Eddie and a "hot chick"), a few new moves, and more. The most noticable change, however, is on Career mode, and I'm sure you've already heard about it. NO MORE TIME LIMITS. You now have to go and find people and they will give you missions to do, and you are usaully timed on just those mission in particular. And another thing: once you have 90 Pro Points, you have a Pro Challenge to complete. I have reached mine with Bam Margera, and on his you have to skate down Alcatraz Island in a shopping cart. Sounds easy? It's not. Hard. Frustrating. Tiring. Good words to describe it. Anyway, moving on... The game's system is like the second game; you get cash and spend it at the skate shop. You can buy hidden players for 9,000, secret levels for 1,200, boards for 400, movies for 400, and so on. Once you have gotten every piece of cash and completed every single objective, you have enough money to unlock the "hot chick". I'm pretty far from that. The levels are: 1. College-FUN FACTOR-5/5 2. San Francisco-5/5 3. Alcatraz-3/5 4. Kona-5/5 6. Shipyard-1/5 7. London-5/5 8. Zoo-5/5 9. Chicago* 10. Carnival* *=You must buy these levels for a great amount of money Now, to end my review, I will list some of the songs off the soundtrack, as I am always curious to hear the new songs off games like these: 1. Iron maiden: "The Number of the Beast" 2. The Offspring: "Blackball" 3. Sex Pistols: "Anarchy in the UK" 4. Run DMC: "My ADIDAS" 5. NWA: "Express Yourself" 6. AC/DC: "TNT" ...and there's A LOT more, more than 30. But I don't want to waste room. Hope I was helpful. Later.	1
In each of its four Tony Hawk titles, Activision has brought something new and innovative to skateboard games. Like many others, I was wondering what this company that revolutionized skateboarding video games could bring to a fourth title. There are three things I have to say about this game that make it such an awesome game. First, although the gameplay and controls of THPS4 are the same as the previous game, you will notice a change in the format of the game right away. Instead of starting a level with two minutes on the clock to complete as many goals as possible, you start the level with no time limit. You can skate around freely, collecting cash, loooking for gaps and cool places to skate and when you feel like completing some goals you simply skate up to a person with an arrow above their head. They will give you a goal and a time limit. You will find that this format of gameplay really gives you a lot more freedom. Second, the creativity of this game is just amazing. There are mini-games hidden in some of the levels that allow you to earn extra cash. Some of the goals were so crazy they left me staring at the television in awe of the coolness of the game. Also, you are now forced to perfect every type of trick in the book. There are many goals that force you to use a certain type of trick. For example, there is one competition where you are placed on a floor with no ramps to do tricks off of or rails to grind. Your entire run will consist of manuals. Third, the amount of gameplay in this game exceeds any of the previous games by a great deal. THPS3 was short and simple. Once you get the game down, you can beat it in less than an hour. The gameplay hours were extended by being required to beat the game with all 21 skaters in order to unlock everything available. THPS4 is much longer. There are 190 goals total, some of which are insanely difficult. And you don't have to go through the monotony of beating the game with every skater. As you progress through the game with one skater, you progress with them all. These are the three things that really make THPS4 stand out as the best skateboarding game ever.	1
The good: -You are not going to get bored in this game world -New way to activate codes The bad: -Unfortunately, you are trapped in this world forever The strange: -What's with a couple things in Create-a-Skater mode The awards for: -Best new move: Skitchin' The overall: -WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNTIL YOU HAVE FULFILLED ALL OF YOUR IMPORTANT TASKS. WHY? BECAUSE THIS GAME IS TOO GOOD, ONCE YOU ENTER THIS GAME WORLD, YOU WILL BE TRAPPED, FOREVER(unless you know you have to go to bed, etc.; or if someone<your parents> makes you)	1
When I bought Tony Hawk 4, all I was expecting was more of the same exciting formula I had loved with 1, 2, & 3, which would have been fine. To my surprise, this sequel turns oiut to be as innovative as the original one was. The new Hawk features a much greater quantity and variety in the way of level goals to keep things interesting. Plus, now there are different types of competitions included in every level instead of a couple of levels dedicated to competition. Best of all, this one has a fully fleshed-out online mode (as opposed to THPS3's prototypical one). Hilarious characters and in-game gags are all over the place, and there is even the addition of the "skitching" move, pioneered by Michael J. "McFly" Fox in Back to the Future (latching on to a moving car). Top it all off with better graphics and level design, and THPS4 is a definite winner and a must-buy.	1
Everything was in its original case and it was sealed with all the original stickers and brand new unopened and untouched  Thank you very much. Amazing transaction and very good seller.	1
GREAT game and great gameplay! My xbox thanks me for this bought!	1
nice game worked right out the box	1
I'm in love with this game! Plus there was nothing wrong with it, it worked fine!	1
Shenmue II is a phenomenal game. If you're a gamer and haven't played it, you don't know what you are missing.	1
I haven't played it as much as I did the first game but I do like it!	1
I continuously go back to this game, when I'm tired of all others I recently played or purchased.  I could re-explore the game hundreds of times, and never have an identical experience.  I still haven't completed a couple of the hidden scenarios, like Fengmei's birthday party or the Duck races, so I'm looking forward to that!  Even if you didn't play Shenmue, this is still an excellent game, and deserves a third installment!!!!!	1
I'm not a huge gamer but i am really enjoying this game. You can walk around and explore the world, go into almost all the different shops and restaurants, gamble, play video games in the arcade, etc. It reminds me more of a sims or story game than an action game.	1
The game contidition is great and it was recieved earlier than expected which is awesome. This is not the first game i've ordered here and certainly won't be the last!	1
Shenmue was an amazing and rather underrated game, especially considering how nice the graphics are looking back even now. Shenmue 2 I think really should've followed up on that and added a ton more, and I was a little dissapointed to find that although Shenmue 2 is just as good as the first, it didn't really add much to the series. There was a lot I think they could've added to make this game even better then what it was, but they mostly just stuck to their guns. However this is STILL a great game, and anyone who likes Shenmue 1 owes it to themselves to get Shenmue 2.  The visual is great, the story is I think considerably better then the first- (except for the confusing and I think unneccesary end 'scenes')and the fighting system definitely upgrades with its tie-in to virtua fighter. They also added a lot of stuff to be done AFTER you beat the game, which considering the replayability of Shenmue, is definitely a good idea.  I think the biggest flaw of this game that drops the fun factor from 5 stars to 4, is the crappy money requirements they force on you in the early game. The 'work' that you did in shenmue 1 was fun and invigorating, and you made more money the faster you worked. In this game, you end up playing a lot of 'lucky hit' to make money, a game I hope in my wildest dreams doesn't actually exist in hong kong. It's entertaining on it's own, but sticking in the game to play 2 hours of lucky hit isn't exactly something that makes me think "i want to play that game!"  However, even lucky hit really isn't that annoying and it goes away after a bit and you can go back to enjoying all the other crazy mini games and storyline and QTEs that Shenmue has to provide, which is what it's really all about. Definitely a cool game that is worth owning.	1
While Shenmue 2 never sold well on the Xbox,it sold quite a lot on the DC. This was due to people being outraged that a completed DC game got canceled at literally the last minute and moved over onto the Xbox for a North American release (Shenmue 2 was supposed the DC very last game,think of it as going out with a bang) So a majority of people ignored the Xbox version completely and imported the English subbed PAL version. Anyway enough with the history lesson on with the review.  Shenmue 2 takes place right after the events of Shenmue 1. Shenmue 1 only contained 1 chapter of the Shenmue universe whereas Shenmue 2 contains 3 chapters. One thing that people will notice right away is that there was a whole chapter dedicated to the ship but it is only mentioned in the game near the beginning in one sentence (you can unlock a few books that tell you what happened on the ship) A nice touch that was done for Xbox owners who purchased the game was that Sega decided to included a 1hr 30min DVD on the events of Shenmue (it's just a DVD with every cut scene in the game). I can tell you right now if you didn't like Metal Gear Solid because of all the story telling. Then Shenmue 2 is not for you,it is basically just an interactive movie. I found that there was not as much fighting as the back of the box makes out to be.  The graphics of Shenmue 2,while beefed up a bit for the Xbox,Shows it was essentially a straight port from the Dreamcast with a few extra features added in,there is now a camera option in the game witch lets you take pictures of people in the game to unlock a whole lot of stuff.  Overall Shenmue 2 is a great game if its your kind of thing. Its just very sad that we are most likely going to be stuck with the cliffhanger ending that ended Shenmue 2.	1
This was a great RPG game.  This is the only kind of RPG I can play. I really don't like most other RPG's requiring you to learn a new language, fight every other scene, etc. etc.  Its like playing Starwars, without any weapons.  (I hated all the Starwars movies!)  I do, though, enjoy this type of game though!  I love the games that give us a beautiful, well known city as the backdrop (Max Payne, Fear Effect 1 and 2, Spiderman, Shenmue 1 and 2, etc.)with a great mix of gameplay, and exploration.  This is my favorite type of RPG style game.  I give this game two gamer thumbs up!!!  Awesome!!!  MC White said:  Check it out!!!	1
At first i was unsure about this, but after playing the first game on the Sega Dreamcast i was hooked. The game is simply huge, there is so much to do and see and the story is very engrossing. Of course you don't have to follow the story. The game gives you the chance to explore the vast city and indulge in such past times as darts and even gives you the chance to play some of Sega's classic arcade titles. This game won't be to everyones taste however, it can take up alot of your time and moves at quite a slow pace. So anyone looking for fast paced action look elsewhere this game requires alot of patients. This being a convesion of the original Dreamcast game, the graphics do look slightly dated and the voice acting is terrible. Still if like me these things don't bother you that much and your after somthing with an epic feel then i highly recommend this game, but if shooting things and big bangs are your thing then i think you would be much better off sticking with the Grand Theft Auto games. But if your willing to open your mind, you might find yourself hooked just like i was.	1
I'm starting this review with a plea to Sega, you have to release Shenmue 3, how can they leave the series dead after the ending of this game.  The Shenmue series are among my favourite games of all time, I finished Shenmue II and immediately wanted to play the next episode in the saga.  Sadly it seems at the moment this isn't going to happen, which is a crying shame, but I can only hope Sega change their mind.  As for my review of Shenmue II, it like it's predecessor is a classic, in fact I think they even outdid the original with this.  It is a much bigger game, taking place over 3 large areas, including Kowloon in Hong Kong.  The scope of the game is massive, there is so much to see and do, and in Kowloon there are 40ft scyscrapers to explore amongst other things.  The only drawback from the original is that the online features are gone, in other words you can no longer set high scores for the mini games and put them on the world ranknings.  This is only a minor compaint however, the fighting is as slick as the previous Shenmue game, with numerous moves (taken from the virtua fighter engine) to master.  There are now more arcade games, with classics like Outrun added, and more slot machines and even more toys to collect.  If you wanted to you could waste days on this game, there is just so much to see and do.  As with Shenmue I, it's a classic, I only hope Sega get it together and Ryu Hazuki's adventure ends properly.	1
Now THIS GAME I COULD NOT WAIT FOR!! LOL. Seriously after I beat Shenmue 2 I was like looks like im going for Lan Di on part 2. So I was really hyped up about this game. The graphics are better than ever. Alot more people you interact with, and alot more fighting scences. This game is off deeeee H0000k.	1
One of the Greatest Dreamcast games ever made is finally making it's second appearance...ON THE MICROSOFT XBOX.  Shenmue II not only out does the first one in every way but surprasses it even more, this game is unbelievable.  It is handsdown, my favorite Xbox game ever...EVER.  The story continues with Ryu Hazuki on the journey to find his fathers murderer and to meet a man who may know alot of things about his father then he'd imagine.  Now the game takes place in Hong Kong, and Ryu is still on the hunt....get ready because not only are playing one of the best sequals to a game ever..but you'll be having one of the greatest video game experiences....ever..  Shenmues Graphics are just amazing, As you've already notice I'm not going to give it a negative on visuals since it's not fair because this is a DIRECT PORT from Dreamcast....Those idiots like IGN and gamemagazines should of known this is a direct port and that the visuals were going to be bumped up, hell it would take poor suzukie EVEN MORE YEARS to make the visuals amazing....but who cares cause this game is still AMAZING.  The sound/music is just as beautiful as the original Shenmue, sometimes I'd just stand at one area and listen to the music..it's just so brilliant..  The level desighn for Hong Kong/Kowloo is just incredible, especially one the final chapter of the game, which I won't spoil.  Something I like Shenmue II more then Shenmue I is that Shenmue II is just one of those flat out "Sequals that didn't fail one bit" as I can see alot of people love this game but are dissapointed compared to the original...I'm not one bit, Something that Shenmue I had that made me fall in love with the game was the FREE BATTLES and QTE'S....Theres even WAY MORE of those in Shenmue II, and they've never looked so good on the Xbox.  Other then the sequal having more action then it's predecessor, something that I loved about Shenmue is that it got you all pumped up all the way to the grand finale...THIS DOESN'T FAIL AT ALL.  Especially the Yellow Head Building part, which is by far one of the greatest moments in Video game history..  Everything about Shenmue II on Xbox is amazing....It's just so Brilliant!!!!!  Now for anyone who hated Shenmues Slow paced gameplay DO NOT GET THIS GAME, Shenmue II is just the same(but a lil better) as it's predecessor.  It will take awhile to get to the action....More like when you're at the end of the first chapter which by the far longest in this game..  Did I mention this has a very good Length..If you skip all the sidequests and just beat the story for the first thenmue, it would take about maybe...10 to 14 hours...It took me about 13 hours and 45 minutes.. Shenmue II takes about 20 to 30 hours of just playing the story mode of it and skipping some side quests....It's just bigger, better and longer...  The Good  -Superb Visuals and got a bit bumped up on the Xbox  -longer then the original  -the voice acting got a tad bit better but not by much  -Theres more character development and we finally know what SHENMUE means!!  -An amazing scenarion that has to do with the Yellow Head Building and LAN DI!!  -More FREE BATTLES and QTE'S  -More clues to find and people to ask, for me it was fun  -The Music is beautiful  -IT'S Just better then the original...that's all I can say about that....  The Bad  -The controls are TERRIBLE, I had to adjust em' before playing the game  -It got a lot of bad review on lots of sites about it's visuals...they should have known it's a straight port from the Dreamcast  -Just like the Dreamcast...Poor Sales for Shenmue II means NO Shenmue III in the future  -Some like myself were left wanting more after Shenmue II's Ending...amazing though..  Shenmue II on the Xbox is one of the best games ever made, and one of the most overlooked xbox title ever..period..  Just like every other Sega Game on Xbox...  Please if you liked the original you will LOVE Shenmue II, it's just better, longer, better looking, more action, MORE EVERYTHING!!  Why the perfect score?..Because on like most of the idiots who gave it abad score cause of Visuals, I'm being mature about it, so what if it's a direct port from DC, The visuals are still amazing even if it's no Doom 3 or Ninja Gaiden....Other then that, Shenmue II is just a beautiful game and that is why I give it a.......  5 out of 5 stars...  Brilliant game....	1
i agree like others shenmue 1 and 2 are among the greatest games alltime great story amazing graphics and mix of movie like cinemas with a deep easy fighting engine in shenmue you're looking for the man who killed your father youll travel around asking questions fighting buying grocerys even working all to help you on your ultimate goal in shenmue 2 u arrive in hongkong to keep on the trail of the man who killed your father theres so many cool things you can do in this game buy diffrent cassetes to play even play old 80s games in an arcade inside the game that has all segas arcade games they had in 1987 the year this games based in this game time matters and it goes from day to night seasons change and youll interact with hundreds of people and do hundreds of mini tasks as u look for your fathers killer when u fight its like an action movie only it controls perfect and its deep fighting u have over 50 moves buy this game while they still make new copies its got a cult following for a reason the game teaches u to exhaust all options before fighting respect the ederly feed the hungry and animals its a really cool smart game the ending is amazing and cost 5 million just to make the final scene theres no other game like it youll become addicted to the minigames and shed a few tears over the games artistic beauty i kid u not we are all waiting on yu suzuki to announce a third and final shenmue	1
This is my first RPG I played and rented and this kept me hooked with the storyline. This isn't very linier because if you mess up on an important job you'll do something different. Once I had to meet the boss to find out about RYO'S father and I had to fight a gang of thugs and I failed because wave after wave of them beat the crap out of me. Then I was healed and I met a gang and I had to ow em 400.... There's loads to do, fight with diferent moves, arm restle, play darts, spar with someone, do jobs and many more and most of those listed above is to earn money.	1
For anyone who hasn't played any of the shenmue games then pay attention, this isn't like any other game you can explore the cities talk to people and even fight some of them. it has a great story line and game play and this time its only one cd unlike the dreamcast one which was three. the graphics are still like dreamcast but  its still great, i cant wait for shenmue 3	1
I can't really explain why I fell so deeply in love with Yu Suzuki's first console release, the Dreamcast's original Shenmue. Perhaps it was the sense of complete freedom, which allowed players to spend their income however they saw fit, completely disregarding the story in favor of video games and little toy capsules. Maybe it had more to do with the utterly enveloping environment, which went further toward becoming a totally immersive scenario than any other game in history. Who knows, maybe it was the game's setting in mid-80s Japan, two cultures I've always found fascinating (80s pop culture and traditional Japanese culture). One thing's for certain, it wasn't the emotionless, deer-in-the-headlights expression constantly sported by the story's hero, Ryo Hazuki. Regardless, I was hooked on this story of revenge, reality, and the kind of awkward relationships characteristic of our teenage years. Though the Dreamcast sequel never arrived in America, Sega revamped the title, added a few new features and finally released it on Microsoft's Xbox. Alongside Halo, it was my first purchase for the enormous black and green machine. Bar none, the coolest thing about the Shenmue series is its outrageous attention to detail. There exist hundreds of storefronts, people, objects, games and environments that don't have any impact whatsoever on the story itself. They could've just as easily been left out, yet their inclusion broadens the game's scope substantially. Almost every doorway can be opened, every object, from the fliers hanging in a popular street corner to the televisions hidden away in the corner of a pawn shop, can be examined in detail. Sega even carried on the tradition of including emulated versions of Suzuki's arcade hits, this time packing in Afterburner II, Out Run, Hang On and Space Harrier. There's no such thing as a cut scene in Shenmue II, everything you see is live rendered. And, while that was a real feat for the Dreamcast (producing graphics on the fly that rivaled those of the Psone and N64's pre-renders), it's not as impressive on the Xbox. Though it gives it the old college try, Shenmue isn't as visually impressive as Rygar: The Legendary Adventure on the PS2, Metroid Prime on the Gamecube or even Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee on the Box itself. Honestly, though the visuals are improved slightly, this still looks, feels and functions much like a Dreamcast game. The water effects, especially, pale in comparison to what we've already seen the Xbox can do. The game looks above average at best. Not great, but still good. As I mentioned earlier, the real strength of Ryo's world is the tremendous variety in the storefronts, environments and various items, and this is something that helps set it apart from the pack. Occasionally, Ryo will be drawn into a fight scene, which functions like a strange blend of Final Fight and Tekken. Visually, the transition between "wander and talk mode" and "fight bunch of guys mode" is almost seamless. Very rarely are these fights one-on-one affairs, and you're usually called upon to take down upwards of a half dozen guys at one time. You've got an impressive list of moves at your disposal, with more available as the game progresses, but really only utilize about ten or eleven on a regular basis. The musical score to Shenmue II follows in the footsteps of the original; it's epic. Every one of the arrangements in the game serves to broaden the scope of this already impressive, expansive title. It truly feels like you're playing a character in a major motion picture, and it invokes your emotions at just the right moments. Near the game's conclusion, when Ryo stands atop the roof of the tallest building in town, staring into the sunset, you really feel as though you're coming of age along with him. When he first rides into port aboard an enormous ocean liner in the game's opening scene, the music further emphasizes that this is the beginning of a tremendous journey. It really is that solid. Pity I can't say the same about the voice acting. Every one of the characters is just as wooden and emotionless as Ryo himself, which is one of the dark clouds that seems to have followed this series throughout its existence. Though everyone in town has a distinct voice, they all share similar traits; nobody gets excited about ANYTHING, and they all place intonations on the wrong words with frightening regularity. Ryo himself is one of the least appealing characters I've ever played, and nearly everyone in the world seems to share this disposition. It's hard to get excited about the revelations involving Lan Di and his relationship to Ryo's father, when those making the revelations are themselves completely disinterested in the proceedings. Included with the Xbox version is a DVD containing the majority of the cutscenes from the original Shenmue for Dreamcast. I found this to be a great, somewhat quick, refresher course before diving into the new events. It'd been years since I last ventured into this world, and I was reminded of several small threads I'd have otherwise forgotten. On that same hand, I can imagine how much the inclusion of this disc would have aided players with absolutely no experience with the Dreamcast. A great idea, and something I wish more gaming dynasties would consider. Overall, I found myself enjoying the first Shenmue more than I did the sequel. This is still a series I'd be interested in seeing pursued, but no matter what you may have heard... it HAS taken a small step down with this release. While the first game focused much more on Ryo's inability to relate to his peers, his awkward social life and his pure intention to avenge his father's murder, the sequel delves more into the spiritual and political ramifications of his actions. It wasn't quite as much fun as the original, though the overall feel was very similar.	1
This game is a beautiful sequel to the epic Shenmue: Yokosuka. I loved this game because it had the good things about Shenmue 1 incorporated into Shenmue 2. The plot,the free battles, the GTE's(quick timer events)and the constant search for the truth. Although there are flaws in Shenmue 2 they do not affect the gameplay. The backround music is beautiful, the graphics are extrodinary (based on the first Shenmue)and the story plot and events are addictive. You cannot put the controler down!!  Also there is much more of the city to explore instead of the small city in Shenmue 1. This game is great because you are in a different city, and you need to fend for yourself. Instead of getting money everyday from Ine-San, you must work and make a living. You can also gamble and use pawn shops. Although the gambling is fun, you might lose all your money. Also I don't recomend pawning you toys in until you get the higher paying collections. Also use a second person to help with arm wrestling. Have the person tap the A button fast while you press the left, right,up,down buttons (as shown on the screen).  Many people aren't playing this game, so there might not be a chance for a 3 chapter of this epic journey. So please everybody out there play and enjoy Shenmue 2!!!	1
I was a fan of the original, but just barely bought the sequel because I had Metroid Prime... Metroid will always win out in priorities, but Sega fans and Xboxers should buy this game without hesitation.  Shenmue 2 is the sequel to the sleeper Dreamcast hit that debuted at the end of the Dreamcast's life, in fact it was the last Dreamcast game I bought, and it is to this day my favorite DC title simply because this game is a very versatile title. There is no genre that this game series does not cover at some point. Ryo has to learn new skills, and master them, like RPGs, he has to gather clues and information collect items, etc, like RPGs, there's a deep and compelling story, like RPGs, there's mini games galore, exploration, adventure, fighter game type action (similar to the Virtual Fighter Engine.) There's so much going on in this game, its part sim, part RPG, part adventure, part fighter... How could someone not enjoy it? Especially since many of the flaws of the original game have been fixed? Lost? You can easily find someone to show you around. Broke? Part time jobs, though I don't recommend gambling... I lost over $1,000 that way, ironically right after I had won that much! All this in the midst of what is at its core one of the most comprehensive and beautiful epic stories of our day. I've been enthralled by the story of the game, but sadly sales of this remarkable game have been less that stellar. The game is selling so poorly that there may not be a Shenmue 3, and the story is far from over. It isn't fair that such an artistic and beautiful game like this be passed over without so much as a second glance. I implore all Xboxers out there, please save Shenmue and at least give this game a look. There's a movie included with the game that summarizes the plot of the first game, although the movie does not do justice to the original game itself, which has a great deal more to it, it will still let you know what you need to know to get by story wise in Shenmue 2, and in all honesty Shenmue 2 has far fewer flaws. Many people found some aspects of the original tedious, like having to wait around for hours on end for an event, but thankfully this one allows you to fast forward to the appropriate time, rather than seeking out stuff to do. Because Sega and AM2 addressed so many of the flaws of the first game it is well worth it to pick this title up, even if you haven't played through the original. Just watch the movie first and you'll be fine. PLEASE BUY THIS GAME! Don't let this masterpiece fade into oblivion... imagine if 24 were cancelled midseason and you'd know how I feel about there not being a Shenmue 3.	1
This game is one of the worst tycoon games I have ever played, and most of them are terrible to begin with. What is the point in adding on to an already terrible game?!	-1
Shenmue and its sequel are like having a real job...but even less fun. If tedious wandering and horrible dialogue are your forte, you might dig it. Everyone else: Save your money. Not even worth renting.	-1
Yea, this game is gorey.  Once you kill (many different ways to kill him/her) a terrorist, you can basically, at your leisure, just shoot the crap out these enemies.  Once the limbs are eliminated, you will begin to see their lungs--no lie.  It's that gorey.  But it is great fun to watch!  Just like Soldier of Fortune 1, you will explore levels situated from dense Vietnamese jungles to a remote ship out on the Atlantic Ocean, from the Airport Terminal to Japanese urban streets.  From mantions to massive mantions.  Lots of variety.  Also, for each level where you combat outdoors, it's either raining/snowing or just plain clear.  In the beginning of one level where you enter the large virus-producing (discuss later) lab., it's like 50 degrees below zero, and terrorists aren't expecting you.  I love the music in this game.  When on the main menu, you're greeted with orchestrated music, that sounds very suspenceful but critical music.  You'll know what I mean when you hear it.  Also, each level has slow-paced and fast-paced music.  Each pace changes when the mood changes--what I mean is:  fast, suspenceful music when you're in danger, and vice versa.  I love the mantion level music, probably the best orchestrated music--kind of sounds like Medal of Honor, WWII type music.  Weapons range from a sidearm to the UZI, to an AK47, to an ultra-powerful shotgun.  Grenades are awesome.  Choose from either phosphorus (eye-blinding), stun (loud/bright) or flame (destroys objects and flames up stuff)grenades---and then you have your regular explosive grenades--NOT that the others DON'T explode also--they do explode.  The story is about John Mullins trying get face to face to Promethius and his connections with the illegally-operated labs that are producing a fatal virus that will kill everyone, which you will notice after the Vietnam level, where you're in a small city with sick people regurgitating.  Taylor, a partner of John Mullins, and Sam, John's advisor, are in the game.  However, later in the game, after the ship in the ocean, when you fly back to the "the Shop" or headquarters in outskirts of NYC for a mission breifing, the 2-storey building partially explodes because of an "inside job".  There's a fire, and must rescue Sam and bring him to the awaiting ambulance.  I liked that part.  I have a GeForce FX 5200, 768 MB RAM while playing SOF2, and there are instances of slow-down, but not drastic but somewhat noticeable.  However, that only occurs if there are many objects and buildings in the background, of course.  You can also adjust the graphics settings to make it faster.  There are many reasons why you should get Soldier of Fortune 2.  Excellent, driven plot; realistic graphics like eye-candy; sounds great on my computer; gameplay is excellent with unlimited gorey scenes; there are also great scenes of destruction, too.  Jeff	1
In comparison, this game is like Jedi Knight 2. The singleplayer is a fun and interesting expierience. The main characters are incredibly alike, and the graphics are alike. The multiplayer consists off pushing guys over and doing backslashes in jedi knight 2. That was a fault in jedi knight 2 that led alot of people to different games. This game has a problem with multiplayer as well. Namely... the people. There are so many little kids that believe themselves kings of the online gaming world that it is pathetic. The multiplayer brings nothing new to the table except when you play the outdoor maps. Namely the large ones with weeds and houses. Those are the best maps as you can hide in a house and guys are hiding all over the place. There are people hiding in the grass sometimes ambushing you or people in buildings waiting behind doors. Other than that, most of the levels get boring. Most of them. The single player is truly an expierience. Jedi Knight 2's was fun, but this game has a great thing going with the GHOUL II engine. You basically dismember your opponents. Sometimes it's fun, others it can be a little gruesome. Namely guys falling over holding their arm sockets. On one hand though, it does make the game feel real, and fun. I The single player also has stealth. It's okay. There are some problems with steath that make it kinda boring. The weapons are pretty cool too. The shotgun is fun, but what's cooler is customizing your pistol with laser sight and silencers. Now, the light attatchment would be cool if the editors made the light a little less bright. You can basically illuminate the land for a mile and have no enemy realize your existence. There's also some nice nades that are fun to use. The singleplayer portion is the reason to buy this game. Multiplayer is rather dull and feels meaningless most of the time. That's why there's counter-strike. If you are expecting anything really new about multiplayer.... It is too easy. I haven't played multiplayer in a year or two. I logged on a big sniper server yesterday and was 58 17. It was almost laughable at how veterans of cs will excel in Solider of Fortune 2. If you haven't played cs than SOF2 is a fun multiplayer expieirience I would say. There are also some bugs in the game. You may shoot a guy and bullets will go through. This is extremely rare and sometimes happens when he is running. There are also other things you'll see that don't crash the game, but they certainly tell you alot about SOF2's testing team. In one part a prisoner is holding an uzi, then he kills the guard and picks the uzi up again. It looks really stupid because the testers should of caught that. Anyways, this game is a solid investment. If you enjoy the ability to fully dismember your foes then get this game.	1
SOF2 is what soldier of fortune 1 SHOULD have been. All the unrealistic sci fi weapons are gone. Gone is the stupid Comic-book villain wanna be bad guys. And finally we have a selection of REAL weapons to choose from, complete with selective fire, alternate fire modes, and some other nice touches. SOF 2 definatley improves on the first. Based on the quake 3 engine, the graphics are pretty good, though not always great (by modern standards). There is an abundance of bland textures and less that perfect character models. Over all though, the graphics are pretty good, though in some places the detail is definatley lacking. The infamous GHOUL engine form the first game, which allows for dismemberment and all sorts of gruesome graphical effects is back and much improved. Bullets holes and even throwing knives will now show up anywhere on a model where it is shot (the first game only had pre ploted points on models so you might shoot someone somewhere and have the bullet hole show up 2 inches left of there - but no more). The gore is more detailed and grittier than ever. More precise damage effects are obvious - shoot someone in the face and you can blow of thier jaw, or rip part of thier skull off. Really nasty stuff. Occasionaly a grenade will leave behind a dark real pool of sausage meat looking stuff that actually gave me shivers. But somethings are missing here... there are no more intestines hanging from the belly like in the first, which I thought was the nastiest effect in the game. There is also no graphic deption of brains either. Though what was done is surely disturbing enough. You'll want to keep this one away from the kiddies. The weapons are fairly accurately modeled - much better than the first, but there isn't enough of them. Nothing like in Counter Strike or other games. Nor are there any varients of the main weapons, and the ad ons like laser sights are VERY few. The guns don't feel very different either. The game is still an action game and I suppose it plays the roll well - though more attention to realism here would have been good. Gameplay goes from great, to disapointing. The story tries to use some "half life" tricks, but it ultimatley fails. And many of the missions and levels are pretty poor. The character AI is also pretty sad, and not believable - also the gameplay is completely linear. The environments aren't very interactive, and the game feels old by the time you're half way through it. Online multiplayer is good, but not great... I still prefer counterstrike. The random mission generator is a GREAT addition - atleast on paper. In practice it creats bland, unintriguing missions and maps, and creates the same ones over and over. THere is no real pressence of urban combat or interesting environments. and in general I feel disapointed. The game is fun, and a VAST improvement over the first, but gameplay needs tweaking and the developers should both focus on detail and realism (this game needs polishing) as well as get a little more creative. No doubt though, many SOF fans will be MORE than pleased with this game as it fixes the most obvious faliures of the first.	1
This is very good game but the graphics engine is a little iffy with shawdows getting stuck inside of people sometimes.  The grapchis are great however, you just have to crank them up (I heard some people complain that this game is ugly, not the case if you can just learn how to up your graphic settings.  There are a great deal of fun weapons in this game as well as varied levels, although some of them are a tad annoying (one mission if you wonder too far from your squad you get shot from your team)  The gore in this game does add a level of specialness with a geomod engine for bodies basically. Suggested for any fps fan.	1
I played the first Shenmue over 2 years ago on the now dead Sega Dreamcast.  I am convinced that Shenmue was the ONLY reason to own a Dreamcast and I anxiously awaited Shenmue II.  But then Sega announced it would discontinue the DC and that eventually even Shenmue II was cancelled for US release (though Europe and Japan did get it).  Luckily for us, Microsoft kindly picked this title up for it's XBOX and gave us US gamers hope that the series would continue on! It was a long wait, but finally the definitive version of Shenmue II has arrived!  XBOX owners truly benefit and to reward us for our wait and loyalty, Microsoft included a full length DVD movie of the first Shenmue game (awesome!!) and they went back and improved the game by improving the textures, adding voice dubbing (I hate subtitles) featuring the same voice actor who did Ryo's voice in Shenmue 1, and added hard drive support, faster load times, a rock-solid frame rate, and so much more!  And it's all on ONE DVD disc!  No need to swap discs during play like we were used to on the Dreamcast versions (the DC version of Shenmue consisted of FOUR discs!).  Needless to say, Microsoft and Sega did a fantastic job making this the definitive version for the true Shenmue fan!  They could have done a quick and dirty port and just called it a game, but they wisely chose to improve it! The game is great...a strangely addictive mixture of Virtua Fighter-style fighting, 3D exploration/detective work, and some QTE events. The world you interact with is a true living/breathing world complete with clock and common people who follow schedules and daily patterns!  It's so much fun just to walk around interacting with everyone and seeing how people react.  This is as close to a virtual world as you'll find!  The fight scenes are great and there are also full versions of classic Sega games like Hang on/AfterburnerII/Space Harrier!! Whether you're a true fan or just looking for a great adventure with plenty to do, buy Shenmue II today.  You will not regret your purchase!	1
A year ago, I waited and waited for Shenmue II to come to the Dreamcast, but after I heard that it was cancelled because Yu Suzuki decided to port it over to the XBox, I was all but angry at Suzuki-san ! If it hadn't been for the cancellation for the North American DC Shenmue II, then perhaps the Dreamcast would be a more memorable machine before it died out in 2002. Now in November, Shenmue II is about to hit the shelves for the XBox only. And you can bet, it will be one of the greatest Sega titles to hit the XBox...of course, Sega will be making mostly XBox titles than just PS2, GC and GBA games ! From what I've heard from all of you, the game still retains its realism from the prequel and the QTE still exists ! And as always, Shenmue II's visuals will be served as eye-candy to the gamers who have stuck with the prequel and the European version of Shenmue II. This is yet another preview that I'm giving out ! When it comes out, expect an immediate review from yours truly ! Can't wait 'till it comes out !	1
The Zoo Tycoon series is one of the greatest thing to happen to RTS (Real Time Strategy) since the invention of the optical mouse! Marine Mania offers a new twist with the introduction of animals that must have aquatic habitats. This game also comes with the "Dinosaur Digs" expansion, which is frustrating if you have already purchased it, and great if you haven't The combination of the games gives you a ton of challenging scenerios and batch of animals to keep in your zoo. I only wish you could pick up unhappy guests and throw those whiners in the lake like you can in Roller Coaster Tycoon! Overall, this is a fabulous game with tons of replay value. It is a good, non-violent game to add to your collection.	1
This is a great add-on to the Zoo Tycoon series.  The animals and the buildings are really slick and can add a lot to your zoo.  However, I can't think of anything else they can do for this series to keep it running....	1
This game is great! I am 13 years old and my three brothers, who are 10,7 and 4, love it too. My 4 year old brother needs a little bit of help when he plays it, and my 7 year old brother just needed a little bit of help the first time he played it. And my 10 year old brother is really good at it(except on his first try, six walruses climbed out of their tank and scared the pants off of all the people), and of course, so am I. We have just the trial version and it's really good but it will be even better with the real Zoo Tycoon(it needs it to run completly). The animals are SOOOOOO cute! Especially the orcas and polar bears. You can even name all of them, too. Its like you're running your own zoo! You have to keep all the guests happy by supplying hamburger stands, drink stands and restrooms. You can even make your own orca show and you can put which tricks you want to be performed in the order that you want them to be in. It's a little tricky to keep the Allosauruses and the Velociraptors happy, but you'll soon find out that they like half of one kind of terrain and half of another. Get this game! It's GREAT! P.S: Whatever you do, DON'T use concrete walls for an Allosaurus! It'll break right through them. :)	1
Again, this was purchased for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas.  It was to go along with the original Zoo Tycoon that she received for Christmas.  She wanted Dinosaur Digs as well but I wasn't about to buy all 3 at one time and since she is so into dolphins I figured this expansion pack would be worth it.  And boy was it!  I was pleasantly surprised when I received my shipment and it said it was a "double" expansion kit and included Dinosaur Digs as well!  That alone was worth the price!  When you put this double expansion kit together with the original Zoo Tycoon you can't go wrong!  It made the whole "building your own zoo" come alive!  The sounds, the people, the animals, everything is just thrilling about these games!  And it is very educational for children as they have to keep the animals and zoo visitors happy at all times, whether it's with feeding the animals, feeding the visitors, lowering the price on the food and gift stands, putting up more restrooms, adding more foliage or animals to an animal cage, sending maintence workers to clean up an area, etc.  Children will learn about money, responsibility, and so much more with this game without even realizing it! This is a wonderful expansion pack to add to your original Zoo Tycoon!	1
Like i said in my title, the original Zoo Tycoon did not thrill me.  Just when I thought I had wasted ...Marine Mania came to the rescue.  It took me a while to finally decide: what the heck, I'll get it.  I was not dissapointed.  I mean, great whites and T. Rex's, who could possibly pass it up?  With almost 80 new animals, this game is vastly expanded.  You can build tanks that actually have depth (unlike the previous water terrain tool), and house animals such as orca whales, giant squids, and many different kinds of sharks.  Plus, certain animals can put on shows!  You can impress your guests by having your orcas of dolphins do amazing jumps and breaches, play with balls, and many more amazing tricks!  THe great white shark can even perform in shows; you can have your sharks do breaches and feeding frenzies!  You can hire marine specialists to train, feed, and doctor your marine animals.  You can even put marie plantlife and sunked ships into your tanks to make your animals feel right at home.  Many new scenarios and freeform zoos are also available, includinga Kids Zoo, in which everything is unlocked!  Plus, this expansion includes the Dinosaur digs expansion as well!  Finally, we can turn our zoos into Jurrasic park! You can house dinosaurs such as fast and lethal velociraptors, the huge Apatosaurus, and of course, a T. Rex!  This is definitely everything I hoped for in an expansion, even though the original was pretty unsatisfactory.  Also, here is a little cheat: Hold down Shift, then 4 too get lots of money, but be careful, it could delete some or your fences, so do it early in the game!	1
I was quick to get the first expansion pack (Dinosaur Digs) being a fan of Jurassic Park...how could I resist building my own Dino adventure. After playing with Dinosaurs....how could I see feeding fishes in this 2nd expansion any fun?  Well, I'm happy to say it is...and this pack adds a LOT! I admit, I only got this game because it was on sale....and I am glad I did!  First, if you don't have Dino Digs...do not worry, because this pack comes with it included! That's right you get Marine Mania and Dino Digs both at the same time!  For those previous owners of Dino Digs, there was a rebate available for buying this reduntantly. (check with Microsoft for current availbility and details). So, the Dino Digs part....ya, its cool. You get dinosaurs to add in (which are violent and expensive as you can imagine) along with other ancient ice-age friends and some great prehistoric theming elements! The Marine mania adds a lot to the gameplay.  First, you are able to now think on another plane of building as your tank displays can be tall and deep opposed to the just the X & Y layouts of your other creatures.  Second, some of these animals like to perform...not only do you custom build their show tank and arena for guests (unlike the other 1 click drop and place bear insta-shows in the game)...but you also customize the show "script" (ie: what tricks they do and what order) A neat little income aspect to control.  Thirdly, there is of course a great variety of new animals ranging from dolphins to eels to squid along with a few amphibic animals...and of course the great marine life themed shops, statues, and attractions. Everything else I've said about Zoo Tycoon in another review stays the same...the game is a bit challenging of a sim. There are tons of factors to control while building and caring for your park.  If you enjoy Zoo Tycoon, you will absolutely love what this expansion pack opens your game to become.  This adds so much that it'll make the game playable countless times (did I mention the wonderful "freeform" sandbox modes!?)  All I have else to say that if Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 and this Expanded Zoo Tycoon were all one game...I would never have to open my CD tray!	1
Zoo Tycoon is loved by me. It is a very fun game. I hope to own it this christmas. I own both the original and Zoo Tycoon Dino Digs and they both caught my attention. If i could meet the creators of the game I would say thanks because it is amazing how an animal reacts. Sometimes it even gets funny when you lets dinosaurs out. They eat up the people! Here are a few pros and cons of Zoo Tycoon Pros Very funny and amazing Over 150 animals to choose from with all expansion packs Cons After 5 hours of playtime it gets more boring, but it will always be a beloved game.	1
I have been a huge fan of sim type games for literally yeras. I mean I have loved these type of games since the very first sim city on Super Nintendo. I picked up the first Zoo Tycoon on it's release date and loved every aspect of the game. Knowing, pretty much what I was getting into before I even played it, this game absolutely did not disappoint.  I also picked up Dinosaur digs on release date and got everything that I expected out of it. Although a bit smaller than I had hoped. This did not surprise me however because I have bought many expansions and many of them have been smaller than necessary.  Marine Mania is as good as expansion packs can get. Not only does the expansion pack include Marine Mania, but it also includes Dinosaur Digs, which kind of made me upset me because I just purchased it a couple of months ago. Anyways, I don't care too much for reviews that ramble on, but Marine mania is well worth the purchase, because not only do you get the one expansion, you get a full two expansion packs. So for those of you whoo liked the first Zoo Tycoon and have not picked up Dinosaur Digs yet (or even have picked it up) I suggest that you buy this expansion, it is seriously much fun. Pick it up and enjoy!	1
This game is a total disappointment. Gameplay is relatively simple, moves are limited, and the characters don't seem to move right. In addition, the character's skin has a shiny "Barbie Doll" surface look to it (just doesn't look right). This game gets boring fast. I don't recommend it unless you can pick it up really cheap.	-1
Kakuto Chojin is a Microsoft game that tries to fill the many empty spots that X-Box has for fighting games.  Is it successful in its attempt? Well, let me tell you the pros and cons of this game. Let's start with the pros.  The brightest star in this game is its really simple control scheme.  You can pick up the game and start winning fights right away even if you are not used to playing fighting games.  The graphic is decent - it's nowhere near Virtua Fighter 4 in its quality, but it is pretty good in its own right.  The color pallette used here is darker to fit the storyline.  You have two meters combined, one is your energy and the other one is another meter which when full allows you to execute super moves. Now its time to talk about the cons.  This game is definitely no Soul Calibur, Tekken, Virtua Fighter, or Dead or Alive in regards to graphics.  The characters' moves are basically clones of Tekken and Virtua Fighter, especially the Capoera using character (like Christy Montiero and Eddy Gordo of Tekken) whose moves are almost exactly like those Tekken characters.  Also, if you play a lot of fighting games, this game may be too easy for you, as many moves can be pulled off quite simply. Right now the weakness of X-Box is in two categories: Fighting games and RPGs.  This game is definitely not going to help the X-Box much in the fighting arena. Definitely a rental if you're still interested in trying it out, but don't say I didn't warn you.	-1
Ok. Let's start with the "official" game reviewers shall we? One reviewer said that Vexx aside from modest cresendo's has very little music in it. Ok, that is a laugh. The soundtrack alone is almost worth the price of admission (if you love enchanting flowing musical opus's that is). Graphics. One reviewer said the graphics were about a 6/10 and are "fair". Ok, that's a laugh, at least on the Xbox. This game is just as incredible as any I've seen. Yes, I had Halo and got rid of it. Was it amazing? At times. Was it fun? No. Vexx is the most fun I have had this year, even more fun than Panzer Dragoon Orta which is also an amazing game. Control. Ok, here they got it right. The control varies. The control is only as good as the camera lets it be, which isn't always everything you'd hoped it WOULD be. Big problem on narrow ledges. Be patient and you will be rewarded. You can work with the camera and I swear it does take some tweaking but you can almost always find the sweet spot. Trouble is YOU have to find it yourself, which is time consuming at times. Character. Here's another area that is hit or miss. Vexx is cool, but doesn't say much ... or anything, so far. The story is "there" if you look, but since when do perilous platformers need to win Oscars? Not in my lifetime. Summary. This game is fun, has a touch of humor, it is HUGE, and is worth every last nickel I paid for it. And those are the highest marks any game can achieve. Just rememeber, this platformer will give you a new reason to yell out a four letter word, just make sure when the camera fails you in your moment of need, that the four letter word is VEXX! :)	1
This game rocks! The controls are simple along with the game play! It is very addictive, and the plot is awesome! It runs along the lines of Donkey Kong 64 and Banjo Kazzooe, but much better! Graphics are simply one of the best. I highly recommend it. BUY IT RIGHT NOW! I  MEAN COME ON, YOUR ON AMAZON.COM! BUY IT	1
VEXX is a great a game. It rivals any of the action/adventure platform mascots to Jak/Sly/ & Mario. Unfortunately this 4 year old game that came out back in 2002 didn't seem to receive the attention it deserved. No game is ever perfect and this game has its minor flaws. It's also beautifully constructed & there are other games that came out the same year & their visuals never looked as beautiful as this game. Give it a try. At this point it's most likely under 20 bucks and a few retailers still carry this title. It's such a shame and most likely Akklaim Studios won't be making a sequel to this game. Give it a try & you will love it as much as I do.	1
OK, I admit it - Vexx is a severely ugly character, and the box art is some of the worst I've ever seen.  However, beyond that, the game itself is the best next-gen platformer I've played yet. The combination of incredible levels, skill-based exploration and platforming, enjoyable combat, and addictive riddles are unmatched so far.  And all this from Acclaim?  Great job! Vexx himself is an awful-looking character (although he is wonderfully animated), and the plot is disposable but the game itself is actually quite impressive. Combat doesn't get old, and is rarely required, but it can give you advantages. Vexx has a variety of moves that power up his Talons. The analog control is responsive and accurate, whether Vexx is jumping, climbing, or swimming. The levels themselves are probably the best thing about the game: they are huge, gorgeous, and packed with objectives, hidden areas, and secrets. Here's the thing: there is a series of warp gates to the different levels, powered by a rift device. The more Wraith Hearts you find and feed to the device, the more powerful it gets, and the more levels you can access. This makes the game rather non-linear, as netting five or so Hearts unlocks three entire levels to explore. You can switch between worlds whenever you want, or can try and locate every Heart in a certain level before moving to the next. Each level has ten or so hidden Hearts, clues to which are given to you in the form of a riddle. The platforming is fun and inventive, and challenging. Navigating a certain tower's obstacles in the first world gave me more trouble than anything in Rayman 2 or Klonoa 2 - and not because of the camera. Certain sections of the game are really tough to get through, but are always worth the trouble by leading to a hidden Heart, extra life, or simply another section of the beautiful levels (one has you creeping along the backbone of a gigantic dragon skeleton; another has you trapped inside a giant's mansion, exploring along a huge piano). The camera is a little unpredictable, but you can re-center it, move it with the right stick, or place it over Vexx's shoulder, so finding the perfect angle isn't too difficult. Vexx doesn't really add moves as the game progresses, either - you're quite versatile from the beginning. This cuts down on backtracking, as you're not forced to revisit worlds after learning a new move later on. This keeps the game focused on exploration and platforming. The game is also long, with nine or so gigantic levels. I think Vexx is really worth a look. It's not perfect, by any means. The camera's twitchy, and it sometimes takes a little extra work to see where you're going, but it's a small price to pay for how grand the rest of the game is. The soundtrack is also well-done and diverse, ranging from chorus-backed orchestra to jazz-rock fusion, believe it or not. It helps create a majestic mood to go along with the visuals - thankfully there's little techno. I'm constantly surprised by how versatile and inventive the levels are - it pays to explore every corner. Vexx reminds me a lot of Fur Fighters, in design, concept, and ingenuity. As a side note, I don't think Acclaim quite deserves all the bashing it gets. The Burnout series, Aggressive Inline, and now Vexx are all well-done, enjoyable games - maybe not the most original or polished games on the planet, but each is fun on their own merit. I'm afraid that many people passed on Vexx due to Acclaim's perceived poor status - it's their loss, frankly.  Despite its sometime-cliched content and slightly annoying tech issues, I am very surprised at how addicting and enjoyable Vexx is.  Take a chance on the ugly lil guy, and I bet you'll agree.	1
This game would get 5 *s if it wasn't so...hard!  You see, there are 10 goals that need completed in each level, in any order, but they are by no means easy in any way.  You can just do the easy ones at first, to get to the first couple boards.  But then the goals just get difficult to the point where playing any longer becomes a horror.  Plus, you have to start over from the very beginning every time you complete a goal.  It is also tough to figure out what the goals actually ARE.  They are stated in the form of 4-line "poems" that can be accessed at any time by pressing the BACK button. This game is not racy in-and-of itself, but is rated "T" because of the extreme plot line.  You are a young bat (stay with me) whose parents were killed by a king, so now you vow deadly revenge on the ruler, and I'm guessing that your quest is to kill him and take over as king. It's a fun time, and a recommended title; if you are willing to devote a WHOLE lotta hours on it.	1
This game is great.  The gameplay is slick, the visuals are over the top and the user-interface is effortless.  You can pick this game up and pop it in the console...no reading of the instruction book required.  Plug-and-play at its finest.  I will not delve into plot details here, you can glean those from the editoral reviews and synopsis placed on the site , but I will say that this game is awesome! I like platform games, and I am particularly taken by those games that give me my money's worth.  I want something that won't take me 8 hours to finish.  I want something that gives me 100 dollars worth of effort...based upon the 50 dollars that I shelled out for it on release day. This game does all that and more.  As mentioned earlier, this game is easy to play and requires no learning curve to be mastered.  As far as presentation is concerned, we are given a deep and immersive enviornment fulled with lush visuals and some great effects.  The lighting and changing of daylight vs nighttime cycles are great.  The enemies become more challenging and agressive as the day wanes and night takes hold, so keep looking for those handy sundials to help tame the nasty beasts! The camera can be frustrating at times, by using the right analog stick however, you can alleviate this problem and most often place it in an optimal position.  Filled with hidden secrets and riddles to decipher, this game will keep you occupied for quite some time.  I know that it will be in my PS2 for the next few months and I strive for 100% comletion and the unlocking of all its secrets.  Fans of platforming...get this game!	1
This is the first online FPS for the PS2 system, and it turned out pretty good.  The gameplay is loosely based on the PC version.  It's similar to paintball or capture the flag, as the purpose is to divide into teams that try to capture the flag from the other team and return to their base.  It differs, however, because you have jetpacks, hovercrafts, and jets.  You have bases and a decent selection of weapons at your disposal as well.  This is one of my favorite games for the PS2 right now. The only downfall, and it is a big enough one to keep it from getting five points, is that you can't communicate with other players.  While I never expected something like SOCOM with the microphones, I would have at least expected keyboard support.  The problem is that this is truly a team game, however it is impossible to come up with a strategy because you have no way of discussing it with your fellow players.  The end result is that you have a bunch of people all independently running to capture the enemy's flag, but without support from their teammates or being able to use a frontal attack decoy while you sneak up from the rear. All in all though, I like the game.  I am looking forward to the next online FPS for the Playstation 2.  I hope they learn the importance of communicating in that one.	1
Is this the same GBA "Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by "Jack of All Games". If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not.	-1
Game Boy Advance players get a treat with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The game is gorgeous. That is, when it runs properly. By now, anyone who doesn't know at least the basic story of Lord of the Rings must be living in a cave. Hobbits. A Ring. A Quest to Take the Ring to Safety. Evil Riders. This game has them all. The graphics are really pretty stunning. The little Hobbiton village, the forests, it all gives you a real sense that you're in Tolkein's world, interacting with the characters. Combat is simple turn-based stuff. You do a lot of message-delivering and mushroom-gathering. Now, for the bad part. First, the game is very directional. You must get Item A from Spot 1 to Spot 2. Receive a coin. Take a message over to Person C. Get a cabbage. You gather a few coins by raiding your friends' homes and then steal their crops! Not very nice. And when you've found these few items, you're stuck. There's no way to find more. If you want a third dagger for your party, sorry, the vendor only had 1. If you want to kill more Big Dogs to get your characters better at fighting, nope, you killed the only Dogs in Town. You roam the area looking for more things to do, but you are forced to trudge along to the next area. Which leads to the REALLY bad part. Just about every single person I've talked to about this game has complained of severe crashing problems. The Mines of Moria are particularly notorious for crashing a lot, but crashes happen elsewhere as well. A crash can easily destroy hours of very tedious back-and-forth plodding. A good game to borrow from a friend to see if it's your type of game, but be prepared to save early, save often as you get into it a bit.	-1
This game was fun until I got to Rivendell and I couldn't find Gimli. I had read this was a bug and I thought I was prepared because he was supposed to be in a certain location that I read about online, but he wasn't there! I could not leave Rivendell and then I found another bug where if I dropped items and left the room they simply disappeared in Rivendell. I couldn't continue and was very frustrated. Up to then I thought the game was cool. Now I'm very unhappy.	-1
First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven't played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I've ever played and is a prime example of a  licensed video game gone awry.  You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies.  While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished.  All in all, this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings series and they, along with any self respecting GBA owner, should avoid this at all costs.	-1
With.. Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, Star Fox, Zelda, & Wario World who's going to have time for this? Please ~Acclaim~ no sequels. Truthfully the first level was so boring I didn't care to go further. I know it reeks that you may have payed ~x~ amount of $'s for this game , but don't beat yourself up. Just brush it off and buy one of the other games I mentioned above. I can only give a few nods for good graphics, sound and idea. Hence the 2 stars.	-1
[...] System Specs P4 1.9 256MB Ram GeForce 4 64MB IT Cable Internet Not exactly top of the line but I had to turn all of the graphical options to very low or off. System Specs P4 1.8 512MB Ram GeForce 4 IT 128 MB Cable Internet This one has a better video card and more ram but I was able to bring the settings up to High. In group combat (9 players vs. NPCs) however, server lag kills. Pros: - Breathtaking graphics - Monthly updates - Able to unlearn spells Cons: - No real content. Story quest limited to 13. After which you can get a scarce quest here and there. - No NPC venders. NPCs are only there for quest. - No use for money except learning smith and whatnot. - Breathtaking graphics if you have a 128mb video card (Radeon 9700) - Monthly updates are always an anticlimax. - Authentication problems when logging on. - Massive lag if you are fighting with a group of 9. - Groups are limited to 9 players [...] - PKers are able to camp zone spots. - MOST of the game's population has a character at level +40 - The level cap is limited at 50 and will not be removed until September at the earliest. - Lack of In-Game Admin support. - No point in towns because there is nothing to do there. - NPC mobs all look the same but are given different names and strengths. - Waste of [$$$]	-1
In a nutshell this is not what I expected after playing AC1 for quite sometime. Granted the graphics are outstanding but this does not make up for the lack of gameplay. Basically there is nothing more to do than run around, hack and slash, run around then craft some items to break the monotony. Thats all there is to the game.	-1
As a 5 month beta tester I expected more from the game upon release.  Here are the problems I find and I'll try to be as impartial as I can. * The chat interface is still bugged. * The user interface is sub par. * Pack space issues are a problem. * PVP and character balance are non-existant. * Lack of "content" which does not require constant monster killing. * Crafting system is tedious, gives little reward or desire to even participate in it.  Seems to be a money sync for gold attained while hunting monsters. *  Level advancement becomes very slow and tedious after level 20.  You must fight monsters which are your level are much higher which is often quite difficult, and you get little experience for doing so. *  Spell trees are limited since many of the spells just don't work correctly, or are so unusable because of their duration/refresh time.  Many spells are just prereq's on other trees, and often spell effects are not even known since their effects are not displayed anywhere. * Vaults are very simple, and the movies which are their 'rewards' are equally as simple. * Map areas are level restricted, items are level restricted, dungeons are level restricted, even lifestones are level restricted.  Equivalent of forcing "zones" on people. * Game is very repetitive, mostly because players little other than kill monsters. * A majority of the beta testers did no feel the game was ready for release because of the list above - but was pushed out anyways due to the common practice of companies releasing unfinished games and expecting the players to recoup further development costs.	-1
Like some others I bought this case as it was the only one available. Once I snapped it on I could see how things were going to go. the sides of the case are stiff and the Vita is held inside by a plastic bracket that snaps into the holes created by the lower loops on the system. At first the rubbery section holding them together was stiff making the system bulky to hold and maneuver. I tried using the velcro strip to hold the flaps together as they dangled off the bottom of the Vita and that worked for a while, though the system was still heavier than was comfortable, especially when trying to play sitting down (which is going to happen a lot with the short battery life and short power cable provided.)  Also, unless you're going to leave the case opened, you cannot charge the Vita while it's in the case.  The problem was that the case only did a mediocre job of actually protecting the Vita. The bracket is held to the case by a strip of cloth that has a bit too much play in it, so snapping the case shut and fastening the velcro strip still leaves some wiggle room. The best way I can describe the setup is it's like holding an ice cream sandwich which has started to melt. The Vita shifts all over and has a tendency to flop out the sides a little bit, which makes the case useless if you happen to drop the system. The bracket itself - which the whole assembly hinges on - is anchored by two tiny clips that can be popped off easily enough, but either one breaking will render the whole case useless.  Also I should add that the semigloss rubbery leather texture of the case is nice to look at but is like a magnet for fingerprints and any grease on your hands. The material lining the inside of the flaps tends to pick lint off of any other fabrics it touches, so if you're wearing a colored t-shirt and playing with the system on your lap, it's going to get some lint on it.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this case. It looks very nice when the system is placed inside it right and I'm sure the hard flaps on the case can take a beating, but there's virtually no protection from the sides, which is bad for drops, and if you happen to spill something on the Vita while it's in the case it's still going to get damaged.  I returned this case and got the Travel Pouch which is MUCH more practical. Honestly for the difference of better protection, decent padding, game and cable storage options all at the same price there is NO reason to go with this carrying case over the travel pouch or even the sleeve included with the First Edition bundle.	-1
It doesn't fit new PS Vita model. So it's a waist. Will be returning!	-1
It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that it doesn't work with the newer vita. Where it's meant to snap in is to small and it's a little bit longer as well. I was very happy with the style it would had worked great for me. Game Stop only had two other cases and they both covered it up. I didn't get the aqua vita just for it to be covered up with another color.	-1
Looks bad, functions bad.  Cant charge while in case.  Does not protect sides of vita during a fall.  Hangs off awkwardly while playing games.  Extremely ugly.  Pros: might protect front and back of vita.  Looks good in garbage can, might be biodegradable.  Wow, this thing is really bad.	-1
Look, I get that you want to let the vita swing lose to allow access to the back for use with the camera and whatnot, but this is not a CASE.  A case implies protection from the elements. I would be ok with (and expecting) a case that I had to take my vita out of to use, but when not in use, would afford my device some level of protection from things like rain, and children, and droppage.  This thing does none of that. What it does is expose the entire device on the sides to everything near it. This is literally two pieces of hard leather padding, roughly oval shaped, with the clip in the middle to attach the vita. So you have a leather/vita/leather sandwich. That is not an exaggeration.  Seriously. This thing sucks. You're better off with a fanny pack and some foam peanuts.	-1
Echoing the complaints of others here. The sides of this case are left completely unprotected, which is disappointing considering it wasn't abundantly clear on the box. Leaving it on for gaming is also terribly inconvenient considering you're left with two flaps dangling from the bottom of your Vita during gameplay (and if you fold them to the back, the rear touch pad is obstructed...).  I later went to Walmart to pick up the traveling pouch instead. Sure, it isn't very pocket friendly, but if you're going to be throwing your  Vita (gently) into a backpack it's padded enough to give you peace of mind.  So basically either be very careful with your Vita, or get a different case. This one isn't worth the trouble at all.	-1
As Penny Arcade put it, Halo has become a "cultural phenomenon", perhaps of a level nearing the phenomenon that was Half-life/Counter-strike. When one is confronted by a game that consistently scores 5/5 on most review sites one would expect the game to be revolutionary. Halo is, however, anything but. The enemies are stupid (i don't mean that their AI is lacking, but rather, that they are programmed to be invalids and cowards) and excessively numerous. There were many times where I found myself in a gun turret, with my hand off the keyboard, holding down the fire button and leisurely offing fifty or sixty enemies. After you've gunned down about a thousand incompetent fools who yell "run away, he'll kill us all!" things start to get a little boring. Halo lacks interesting level design, an interesting story, interesting weapons, or even interesting gameplay. The things that would be "revolutionary" about Halo would be the use of vehicles during combat, and the occasional squad-based skirmish. However, Battlefield 1942 has both of these factors, and in greater amount. There were about five different vehicles in Halo, and there are forty plus vehicles in BF1942. The worst part about Halo was the massive onslaught of weak enemies. Instead of battling a few, well trained enemies that would offer some kind of challenge, you fight against seemingly endless waves of pitiful enemies. Perhaps the only thing I found of value in the game was the tactical use of grenades, and the ability to only carry two weapons. The latter would have been much more limiting and interesting if there were more than seven or eight weapons to begin with. Bottom Line: Halo leaves much to be desired. If you're looking for a first-person shooter with a variety of vehicles, look to Battlefield 1942. If you want squad-based or tactical/realistic action, Counter-strike will leave neither you nor your wallet hungry. And if you want an action packed blow-em-away multiplayer game, they you should look no further than the Unreal Tournament series. If you want unispired level design, a weak story and microsoft (re: really, really bad) physics, than grab yourself some halo.	-1
I am a big fan of Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine and I was excited when I picked this game up in the bargain bin. I installed the game with no issue and I started playing it. The first thing I noticed is they got rid of some of the fun things from the original, like the lighter and the chalk. The inventory system is quite clunky and I found I had to stop everything just to change weapons or get the canteen. Speaking of the canteen, I thought that sort of a ridiculous way to get health. I much preferred finding medkits or medicinal plants and having the choice of buying them at the end of every level. The combat is a lot cooler, at least hand to hand, than in Infernal Machine. I like that there are punch combos and such. The way that the enemies can withstand about 15 slices from a machete is pretty incredible to me however and it got really tedious after the first few guys, especially after they began to have guns more often. The controls are really clunky as well, especially when you just want to adjust yourself a tiny bit. You would tap a key and Indy would swing 90 degrees. The graphics are pretty good but other than that it is not that great of a follow up to Infernal Machine.	-1
The game play for Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is very poor.  As others have said, there is no save option in this game, and the exit and loading screens are very confusing and unnecessary.  The camera panning is horrible. You have to move the mouse and the keys to control the character and it takes a lot of getting used to.  Although the sound and graphics is excellent, and I had some fun with the fighting, it's too much of a hassle to control the character.  I will echo what someone else said about the tram sequence being one of the most pointless in PC gaming history.	-1
I'm sorry, but when a game says it is WinXP compatable, but you have to modify it to make it run on XP, then it isn't compatable.  I had 2 of the original games, and had to do a lot of work to get them working.  I can live with that with the originals.  But I got the platinum version because it implied that it worked, out of the box, with XP.  It doesn't.  To the reviewer that said that you can troubleshoot it, why should we have to?  Since just about everyone is using XP, stay away from this, unless you like messing with it.  Even IGN sites don't have a "this will make it work on XP" patches or fixes.  Great games, if you can get it to work.  If you aren't computer knowledgable enough to get them going without worrying about grabbing virus laden programs, stay away!  I have it 2 stars, because if you can get them to work, these are great games.	-1
Live just keeps gettin' worse and worse and worse.  That's why Sega's 2K saga is the new and better generation of baskerball games.  Live's last greatr game was 2000.  Ever since then, it's been getting worse and less realistic.  To me Live 2001 to 2003 are the same game just a diffrent title and new ranks and changed teams.  I highly recomend 2K3 rather than this garbage.	-1
Once again, EASPORTS had promised me a completely new game and once again, I am left wondering why I even believed the hype.  NBA Live 2003 is at it's core, nothing more than the same game as its predecessors.  However, one thing that is new this year is the hyped Freestyle control.  Though gimmicky at first, it becomes surprisingly intuitive as you try to pull off the variety of different offensive and defensive moves it allows.  For instance, by tapping the right analog stick on the controller, you can pull off a string of killer crossovers or spin moves to shake the defender.  On defense, you can reach for the steal while in an intense defensive crouch and raise your hands to defend against a shot without the threat of a ticky-tack foul.  Without this new feature, NBA Live has nothing really new to offer. The graphics are clean and smooth, but are overall generic.  Stadiums and crowds look the same and the players cartoonish with exaggerated body sizes and large heads and hands.  Some players are hard to distinguish from each other unless you recognize their tattoos, hairstyle or playing gear.  The cut scenes in-between plays are amusing at first, but quickly become tiresome as they are repeatedly played over and over.  How many times do I need to see my bench react as if I had been shot and beheaded after a foul?  Luckily, you can turn this feature off.  Nevertheless, I did appreciate the humor and the playfulness in certain cut scenes that really captured the essence and feel of an NBA game Regardless of the graphics, the player animations are smooth and quick.  I don't think I have yet to see the same dunk twice.  Seeing Iverson perform a crossover dribble is pure beauty.  Watching Garnett back down an opponent felt like a battle of epic proportions.  There are also a variety of shots to and from under the basket.  Players will either perform a nifty lay-up or change their shots in mid-air depending on the location of a defender.  Gone are the days of the two foot jump shot that clanged off the rim. Game play is my biggest gripe.  Though the CPU AI is greatly improved this year, there is such a thing as being too improved.  The opposition hardly misses a shot.  Three-point bombs are almost a given and there are way too many dunks as opposed to outside shots.  In fact, it is common to see field goal percentages in the 70's and 80's during the course of a game.  Though I love how the CPU now runs the fast break consistently as opposed to the previous games in the series, the result is almost always a score for the opposition.  Transition defense is practically non-existent since the CPU seems to always make the correct passes that lead to open shots or dunks.  A little humanity in the CPU could have made things more realistic and less frustrating.  Steals and blocked shots are also too plentiful (Sigh.) The franchise mode is incredibly bare bones.  There is of course, the standard player retirements, re-signing, free-agent signings, team lottery and draft.  Player scouting and evaluations would have added some dimensions to the draft as in Madden 2003, but they are sorely absent.  (Double Sigh.)  Game options are also pretty bare.  There is the usual one on one game we have seen in previous games and a tutorial explained by panty-fetishist Marv Albert using grainy video game footage, but that's about it. EASPORTS really needed to up the ante this year to compare with the mighty Sega NBA 2k series.  I was pretty optimistic, but again EASPORTS resorted back to bad habits by releasing the same game with an added feature here and there.  Though the Freestyle control is, dare I say, revolutionary, the problems greatly outweigh the benefits offered by the feature.  Again, they have released a game that is too arcadey and not enough simulation.  Though I have no problem with arcade-type game play, at least give me the option of enjoying a game with realistic shooting percentages, balanced game play, and the challenge of having to work for a score.  Now excuse me while I go play NBA 2k3...	-1
NBA Live was a great title while it was on the Sega Genesis, but with the PS2 and Xbox and G-Cube, EA Sports has lost their minds. In all the Lives they have made over the years no matter the system, old or new, they have used the same engine for all the Live titles. This takes away from what the Live series could be. NBA2K2 and hopefully 2K3 will continue to bring realistic gameplay along with graphics and controls. I urged anyone reading this to play Sega Sports NBA2k from any year 1,2 or the original, and then play NBA Live2003 or 2002 and I will guarantee that you will disown Live and fall in love with any of the NBA2k's. Better graphics, control, and gameplay makes the 2K series surpass anything EA Sports has done for basketball video games.	-1
Can you take on the leage and be one of the strongest? Pros: Great Gtaphics Great Music Finaly got the point of fast break back in the series Cons: What the heck, I hate the analog control Now defensive rebounds are automatic(In 2002 it was offensive, which was better) 3 pointers are almost impossible to make you pick up way too many fouls(offensivley, defensivley) Computers(basicly on superstar)just make me wanna punch my T.V. It's almost impossible to get open Sometimes, I end up throwing the ball out of bounds EA just took another big step back There is hardly any way this game improved on a bad live 2002.  they shoulda sticked with the freaking D-pad, instead of do analog, because now, I just aint good at the game no more.  If you want an EA sports masterpiece, go pick up Madden, NBA Street, or live 2000. Final Words:After all the much better reviews from sites, I wanted to play this game so badly, only to be dissapointed.  Live just went bad when it came on next gen consoles.  Let's just prey to god that somewhere along the line EA will figure out there mistakes, and bring back the good ol days where live was the top basketball game. peace	-1
Fav wrestling game is HCTP. I can't play that on my ps2 cuz i don't even know why. so i thought id buy this to try it out. The controls are crap. Graphics are okay. Game play is pretty crappy. It was a mistake to purchse. The service i got was quick however. that's the only good thing. the game itself... sucks.	-1
This game is a SLIGHTLY better game then Just Bring It.  The superstars do look awfully like the real-life wrestlering stars. There is finally a diffcultly setting, although it doesn't seem to work while you're doing a "Season"   The voice acting is a slight improvement, although it's J.R. and The King except for Tazz and Cole.  The story lines are realistic and sometimes interesting.  The only gripe I have about the game is an effective COUNTER system.  The CPU is as relentless as in Just Bring It.  The controls are easy to pick up, although you have to mash buttons to see different moves.  I still think the best WWE game is WWF NO MERCY for the Nintendo 64.  Shut Your Mouth does have more Wrestlers in it than Just Bring It did.   A slight improvement over Just Bring It, but only slightly.	-1
how bad this game really is.  The controls are absolutely horrible.  I was unbelievably upset that I actually spent $4 to rent this awful garbage.  The only good thing about this game was the many different characters and different types of matches you could play.  It nowhere near makes up for the lack of a decent control system.  The people who made this game need to take lessons off the old WWF games for the N64, because this one is horrid.  Don't waste your time or money, people.  Please!!	-1
Trust me this game will be a stinker. I bought live 2002 last year. The graphics (stink) who cares about coaches or player reactions. That's there problem they spend too much time on reactions and not enough time on gameplay. Get NBA 2k3 Not live 2003. Get real this game is really bad bad and more bad. It is not going to improve unless they get some better graphics in there. The PS1 games of live are better so listen up and stay away. The game will be better then street hoops but not 2k3. I have to say they shure did a better job on madden.	-1
I applaud the effort that went into building this game, but they really needed a few more months on it. The graphics look kind of blurry and some of the textures just don't fit right.  I liked the sound effects...particularly the cabinet doors opening and closing in Frodo's home, but the singing from Tom Bombadil was pretty awful and Frodo's clumsy dancing made it even more ridiculous. The problem is the combat, the stupidity of the enemies and the unforgiveable load times. The enemies move in ways that don't make sense, can't seem to see you unless you strike them, and get trapped by little knee-high obstacles that they should be able to walk over or around. Ring Wraiths just aren't scary at all when a two-foot hedge prevents it's efforts to grab Frodo.  They sure don't seem very motivated. But the load times are very long and jar you out of the experience.  I took this game back to the store and exchanged it for Dynasty Warriors 3.  Dynasty takes about five seconds to load a level or scenario that is about a mile across and has hundreds if not thousands of soldiers and horses in full battle. You play from one end of the map to the other killing hundreds and hundreds of soldiers and even big boss captains that have their own fighting skills.  And ALL of this happens with that one five second load time.  You run inside of a castle, you fight your way down the stairs, you jump on a horse and gallop a half mile to the front lines...ALL of this without a single load time. In Lord of the Rings, if Frodo is the only character on screen and wants to walk into a Hobbit hole, it loads for a good fifteen seconds, then you want to leave...well there is another twenty seconds of load time.  If you accidentally hit the wrong button and walk back in a door you just came out of...it's gonna take you a minute before you get your character back again. This is really unforgiveable with the hard drive on the Xbox being not being used at all.  Even when Gandalf is in Moria, he would stand at the door of a room and wait for it to load, so it would be black until the graphics loaded. The game is also very short...too short for an epic.  It took me five hours to get to Moria and I was just walking around alot, taking my time. Any game that costs $50 better give me alot more gameplay than 10-12 hours worth.	-1
When you first here LOTR Fellowship you think that this would be a good game. Well, you would only be able to think. This game is atrocious! As Frodo, you're running around with a stick(later becomes a migit sword, and then Sting), and rocks. Puny, pathetic rocks. Once you get to the forests you have to fight these spiders..well using the stick is pretty much suicide, so u have to use the rocks. In one place, if u keep throwing rocks, they don't move and they get pounded! o ya....about 250 rocks for one spider...... 1 spider down....159 more to go. TOO LONG! Once you are Aragorn, which is about 10 minutes long,(Frodo about 3 hours and Gandalf about 1 hour) and yes, 10 minutes, you can use good weapons and kill these drunk lunatics, which isn't the most exciting thing to do with a Ranger. You would hope that the cool guy would be longer to play as... with fire arrows and a sword that looks cool, but its just about 10 minutes. With Gandalf, which is the only reason that i gave this 2 stars, you at least fight things that stand (which are orcs and goblins) and you can use this powerful magic. Well here are the major pros and cons. The beautiful graphics are the only good thing in this game that give Lord of the Rings a bad name.  PROS: - Play as Gandalf and he has magic -Long game -Good Graphics  CONS: -  Loading times between EVERY DOOR! Each loading time is about 45 seconds to 1 minute. - too many rocks to kill 1 darn SPIDER! - Frodo is the player the majority of the time   For you people who don't care about the loading times and love frodo and roaming in the shire for 2 hours trying to pick mushrooms and feed pigs, this game is for you. If you want real LOTR Action, and if you want to be able to choose your character between different times, then get Lord of the Rings: Two Towers  because that is just a beautiful game. *Note*  as Frodo, you can use The Ring, but it isn't too great unless you like to run away (which is almost impossible in this game).	-1
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings brings us ever so deeper into the world of Hobbits and wizards. The game is design to be a RPG, but doesn't deliver. The game lacks aside elements that make a complete RPG. The game could of use more interactivity with the environment, more things to do(the game will take you about three hours to beat!) and the graphics are not up to X-Box par. With that, it does include the adventure with Willow and Todd Bonbadil which is a little good addition to the game overall, but is forgotten later in while you progress. Although it may lack in dept, it makes up with a fun engine, supposily a RPG, it reminds me of a  platform: Worriors of Might and Magic, a good game, but not great.	-1
I was one of those people who saw and loved "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring!", the classic movie.  I thought the video game would be much of the same.  Fun, great story, good graphics and overall just something to spend time playing.  Well, I was wrong.  This game is nothing like the movie, and in my opinion was a very over-hyped game.  "Why?" 1. The gameplay: It's just boring.  You start off spending an hour in the Shire, trying to do various tasks, which are rewarded very lightly.  For example, you have to give the lady who's buying your house a letter, which takes 15 minutes to find (usually more).  There is no map of the Shire, no hints of what to do.  Everything has to be figured out by yourself.  So after you find the little paper or letter, you walk back to give it to her.  But nooooooooo wait, you have to find another item without any help and ring a bell because she believe there are "Wolves" in the shire.  That's another 15 minutes if your lucky, 30-45 minutes if your not.  You also have to complete  close to a dozen tasks to get your "Corruption" rating up.  If you become to corrupted (it's a second bar above your health), you just die.  I had to start over several times because of that.  So say that somehow you do get all this done, get stocked with supplies, talk to everyone, and are ready to go in less than 2 hours, you must escape the black riders.  I did this, and it is extremely difficult, and yet in parts so easy it's stupid.  There is always a certain area you can go where the black riders can't get u.  And yet at the end, u must make a run for it.  No where to go, no where to hide.  And the black rider you must at the end escape from, is on a horse.  Well, if you get past all that in 3 hours, without dieing, your lucky.  Most people don't.  And the whole process is just boring.  No excitement, no real rewards.  I hated the first part. Well, once your out of the Shire, you head into a forest.  The forest is full of creatures, which are all so easy to kill.  You must find your 3 companions who came with u, who somehow git lost in 4 different parts of the forest.  This alone took another hour, and if your not lucky, you'll get lost forever (literally).  Once past that, you are caught by a willow tree, when u are suddenly saved by a fat, short man named "Tom Bambaldi" or something like that.  You must then find 15 lilies, which takes another 30 minutes.  At this point, I had died 5 times, had not found anything I liked, was bored, and was just sick of the repetitiveness of the game.  That was my wonderful experience playing this game (luckily I rented, and returned the next day). Graphics: This would get probably 4 stars.  The graphics are pretty goood, but are PS2 graphics.  It wasn't what it could have been.  For example: The black riders are in total 3D, and look really cool.  But their capes for some reason are flat and are in 2D.  Very dumb.  You can't go in the water, which once again, looks very bad.  The leaves you can quote "Run through" you can only run through once.  And they are very are, only a few for each part of the level.  But in many aspects, the game was good.  You can break many things, and that's always fun as they fully destruct.  The Shire is brought to life well, and in many ways, this game was fun to look at.  But with the horrible gameplay, this game could not be saved. 3. Sound / Lasting Appeal: Well, the voice acting was fantastic, and the one point where this game was 5 stars.  It was always fun to listen to people talk, and the cut scenes are very well done.  Unfortunantly, this was the only fun part of the game.  As for the lasting appeal, none.  It takes 5 hours just to get a chapter into the story, and the whole thing, I'm afraid, just bored me. If you think you can stand all this, then this is the game for u.  Persounally, I think a game should start out easy and become challenging later on, and let u do something cool and interesting within the first hour.  Some may like this game, but I sure didn't.  Over-hyped, and over-bought, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the XBOX and PS2 was a disapointment in my mind. Oh, the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is coming to the XBOX on January 1st.  I'd go for that, as it's by EA Sports, has a lot more action, and you play through both movies; The Fellowship and the Two Towers.  Thx!	-1
I admit that I haven't gotten very far in this game.  The reason is that I don't like to play this game.  When I turned it on during the day, It was fun when I was helping the hobbitt village people with the little tasks they needed, but then night fall came and I couldn't see jack.  So I thought I would put the game away and play it later that night.  My place was black as pitch except for the light coming from the television and I still couldn't see a thing.  I'm supposed to be avoiding those black riders, but I couldn't see anything.  Somehow I got past that part.  Then more helping villagers.  That's the best part of this game.  I don't remember exactly where I'm at with this game, but I doubt I'll go back. There are far better games to buy for the XBox than this one.  OddWorld, Blood Omen, and Enclave just to name a few.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this...	-1
Wow, what a let down.  I was looking forward to this game for a couple of reasons. 1.  I love the books 2.  I love 3rd person action/adventure games 3.  Surreal had something to do with it, and I loved Drakan, the Ancients gate (which this engine obviously shares a lot in common with.....well, except for most of the good parts.) Where to start on this turkey..... A:  Graphics.  Very very similar looking to Drakan the Ancients Gate, but no where near the size/depth of the environments in that game.  The game looks passable, and that's the most favorable word I can use, but the maps/environments are very very small for the most part, and you are more or less on a very narrow *track*.  The graphics in general have a sort of cartoony, empty feel.  The game lacks much mood from a visual standpoint, and that's a shame given the source. B:  Gameplay.  1 word...horrible.  All the problems that plague bad 3rd person adventure games are here.  Camera panning/orientation is one of the worst I've played in a long time, which again is a real shock, as Drakan the Ancients gate is one of the best in that regard I've ever played.  Weapon selection (not that there is much/any) is clumsy, and it's a real problem when using Gandalf especially, not that it matters much as the fighting is so simplistic.  In short, just about everything that can be annoying about control issues in games like this, is.  I really don't understand what happened, as the engine is obviously by and large the same one used in Drakan, and it's fantastic in that game.  Perhaps this game had a different team of people, or was actually in development before Drakan was. Whatever the problem is, it sure is lousy. On top of those two things, the gameplay being the major flaw, the game is shockingly short.  I finnished this game in 5 hours, with no cheats, no online help, no guides, it's laughably short/easy.  Also, the game just feels thrown together.  The cut scenes seem very rushed...it's hard to describe this unless you play it, but it really seems very thrown together. In summary.  I wouldn't buy this game, and I have a hard time even recommending that you rent it.  I'm not sure it's even worth the 6 bucks or whatever your local rental place charges. Avoid at all cost....what a shame, such potential to make a truly great game, and from (at least in part) a company that has made a fantastic game with more or less the same engine.  If your looking for a good 3rd person action/adventure that you may not have played, check out Drakan the Ancients Gate.  It's a much much better game than this, in every way possible.	-1
I returned this one two days after I bought it. The game is an interesting concept.  And it's fun for a while.  But even though there are quite a few characters, weapons and power-ups, it still won't hold your attention for more than a day in single player mode. In Xbox Live mode it will keep your interest up for a little longer (not much). The core problem is that the action is so fast that you feel like success has more to do with luck than any skill or strategy.  Although your skill will improve, you still never really get to feel like you're in control of what's going on around you. Also, it is totally inappropriate for kids (kids under 21 in my opinion).  Not just the topless character, but the language and movie clips are also often in poor taste. Fuzion Frenzy is a better party game. Halo and Unreal Championship are (by far) better action games. I think you'll only like this if you use Xbox Live (which I did) and enjoy a sense of panic, confusion and irreverence at every moment of a game.	-1
I'll admit it.  I was excited to play Summoner 2 at first, it being recommended to me by my cousin.  After the first time I failed the first mission, I decided that I didn't want to admit that the camera angles sucked[were bad]attempts later, i was incredibly frustrated that I had died so many times due to simply the jerky camera.  This aside, the anime like graphics and unrealistic attacks, I almost felt forced.  And I thought comboes made you vulnerable for a moment!  The final guy on the first level with the flaming sword attacks me with a double combo and pauses so as i go into attack he unleases the third part of the combo.  The game is jerky and inconsistent.  Summoner fans, I beg you not to play this game, or you will be spending the next few weeks in a dark corner of your room, wondering where your game had gone.	-1
I Got this game thinking ohhthis is a shrek game it will be good! WRONG!! If you want a Shrek game thats not filled with farting and burping and pointless missions get Shrek Super Party!	-1
Words cannot describe how bad this game is.  I can't tell if it is the design of the game to not actually be able to accomplish anything other than running around farting and burping, or if something is wrong with it!  What a disappointment!! PLEASE, moms and dads reading this, do not waste your money on this poorly designed, silly, horrible game.  Find something your kids can actually play!!!	-1
My first objection is it's too easy to die, and you die without any warning. So I got a Game Replay and programmed infinite life. Then the camera angles are very difficult. It's not easy to see up, and sometimes up is where you need to go. And it's not easy to turn around and position yourself to jump. Then jumping is really hard because Shrek sort of jumps backward. He has to hurl himself in not the opposite but a slightly angled position from where he actually wants to jump to and bounce off something. This is just a pain. Then the final deal-breaker is you have to complete five or six tasks on each level. Two of them, catching fairies and finding Easter eggs, you don't need to complete to move to the next level, but all the rest you do, and if something is very difficult for you, then you're stuck. I am not good at time trials, and each level involves doing something really fast and perfectly, and as it got progressively harder, I had to quit and get rid of the game. My Achilles Heel was the time trial in Molasses Sewer where you had to speedily run to a switch in 30 seconds, and the run involved those dreaded backward jumps. And the visuals are kind of dark and dreary. The game is a real cheap-o considering how much care and excellence went into the movie. Why did they allow this to get made? And where's Donkey? And all that gas passing and lighting your own gas, how stupid. And some of the hints are misleading. Like you get a hint to light your own gas to blow open a door when you are standing next to a door which even has an onion so you can get more gas, but that turns out not to be the door you need to blow open. It's way somewhere else. That door does nothing. Why give it an onion and a hint?	-1
Stop making "Medal Of Honor" games. They have the same stupid A.I, and the same idiotic story. The gameplay just gets OLD really fast. Please, don't even rent this game, spend your time just playing great games, like "Halo", or "Final Fantasy X", and "Star Wars:Battlefront."	-1
Let me say, my grandfather fought in WWII, he voulenteered his life to save our freedom, he's still alive today and we both despise this game, you have the first level of Normandy, ok, probably the MOST famous battle (next to charge of stalingrad) in WWII, it's pathetic, you single handedly take over 2 mg42 nests. the game mentions about fighitng with fellow soldiers which you NEVER EVER EVER EVER do! this game is an outrage, pathetic AI, you single handedly take down a german submarine by yourself, infiltrate a nazi headquarters and somehow get promoted to sargent who really just gets [himself] thrown in 1/1000000 odd missions, just STAY AWAY, now if you were to ask me how is call of duty? then take every word i've said and do the opposite, buy COD. NOT MOH!	-1
Here are the pros and cons of the game; I'll discuss each after the list Pros Above Average Graphics Many different Weapons Large Game play Cons Linear game play Save feature is also BS Unrealistic game play at times Difficulty settings are BS  Pros From the start, this game looked good.  The first mission is awesome; you hit the beach and have to fight though the chaos of the situation.  The next pro is the number of weapons was great.  You get to use several different weapons for each war situation.  The sniper rifle is a personal fav.  The last pro deals with the size of the game.  From what I have read; there are 19 missions, so this is not a game that you can finish in an afternoon. Cons The first con is that this game is that it does not allow for you to do anything other then the list of chore list from your mission list.  So it becomes like a list of chores.  The game even has a list of chores that get checked off as you complete them. Next, there is no in level save feature.  So in the longer missions you have to be careful not to die at the end of the level, or else you have to do the whole level over again. SO you can spend hours doing the same thing over and over and over again.  I understand that this is suppose to make the game more challenging, but if I have to do a level over 10 times, I will not think, "Boy that was challenging and fun."  I'm more likely to think, "Boy, this game ... ."  The X-Box has a 10 gig HD, why do developers not create in level saves?  It is not like we will run out of HD space!!! Unrealistic game play takes away from the game.  You can have the shot gun and sneak up on a Nazi.  You then shoot him in the back of the head.  And guess what!!!  He gets up and starts shooting at you!!!!  I understand that one shoot-one kill would not work in a video game, but what the hell!!  A shot gun blast in the back of the head does not kill a Nazi, UNREALISTIC!!!!!! Ok, my last complainant, The difficulty level in the game is total BS.  I was playing and came upon a mission entitled, "Arnhem Knights".  After 5 times of dieing in the middles of this level, I switched the difficulty to easy.  But guess what, I died another 5 times.  Let me give a bit of background to this mission.  You have to fight Nazi's through the streets.  You travel along with a platoon of British soldiers.  First, one would think that having computer led friends shooting at the Nazi's would be helpful, but you would be wrong.  The Brits more or less get in your way and never seem to do anything but die.  So this leaves you to kill the over 150 Nazi's plus the two tanks that are on this level.  I hate to complain, but I do not know of many foot soldiers in World War II that killed over 150 Nazi's in one street battle and also took out two tanks in the process. All in all, I give it two out of five.  So rent if there is nothing else at the store to rent and you need a video game fix.  Shame on you EA for releasing this game	-1
The idea of this game is to go around and collect funk records. Yup, that's about it. The game is simplistic and, although it does have some nice graphical effects, it is, overall, rather bland (and the funky music gets old rather fast). With that said, the game should keep the younger crowd occupied for a while, though. Although I would rate the game on the lower end of a Teen rating (i.e., closer to an E), I fail to understand why Sega would create a game obviously intended for the 10 and under crowd, and then put elements in it that give it a Teen rating. In this case, it is the standard "comic mischief" and some  wiggling.	-1
I can't beleive this game was so poor. The missions were lame. The multiplayer was so annoying. The weapons were poor. And lastly the graphics were so dark I couldn't see the buildings I kept running into. I'm not going to adjust the brightness setting on my T.V. for one game! Forget about trying to scope someone out or using any kind of skill to kill anyone. Its pretty much fire your weapon at will and hope for the best. After playing the pc version online of this game, xbox shouldn't have even bothered putting it out. I would say rent this and find out for yourself before you buy it considering the hype.	-1
What happened! ToeJam and Earl was an awesome series then this POS came out and totally shot the series to death with cheesey looking characters. The new female character is a stupid joke, a true Toejam and Earl fan would wanna play Lewanda or maybe Sharla instead, or heck even Peabo would be awesome. This game should be banned from the Xbox library it is seriously that bad! The game for one thing is totally pointless, and the gameplay sucks, and the graphics aren't much better than N64 or playstation, maybe worse. Its a bad game that really taints an excellent and unique video game series and also a good system.	-1
A clear [similarity] of the already crummy Mario Party series. Maybe it's entertaining for small children, but I doubt anyone else on the face of the earth would enjoy it.	-1
This so-called halo-killer was sad in comparison. Lame graphics, pathetic story, & characters no one cared about. Worst game Ever.	-1
To everybody who wrote a review before this game came out, a heartfelt 'bleep' you.  Wait till you've played the game before you review it.   Brute Force is boring.  Plain and simple.  Despite some very well thought out ideas employed to control a group of characters and a mulitude of different weapons, the game has almost nothing in the way of a storyline, mission briefings are just intermissions between shoot outs, and weapon effects are painfully lacking; especially for a game on the most powerfull console on the market today.   Enviorments are good, occasionally very good, but they are constantly re-used and get old real fast.   Do yourself a favor, save your time and money and skip this one.	-1
the only conclusion that i can come to is that some of the rave reviews of this game were written by those who have a vested interest in you buying Brute Force.  this game is nothing special.  i swear. the graphics are ok.  they're not at the level of Halo, Splinter Cell, or Orta (or Ghost Recon, or Tides of War, or... ok, most x-box games).  i would say that this game looked pretty good if it was on the PS2 (which isn't really saying much).  the environments are kinda bland and the particle effects (gun fire, explosions, items shattering, etc.) are barely there.  the only time i thought the game looked good was using the rifle zoom and during the intro to each level.  the character movement is smooth, but they look like knuckleheads and the enemies are just goofy. you've seen better, much better. the gameplay is about as straightforward as it gets.  it's a third-person shooter so the rules are simple = if it moves, shoot it.  the path before you is totally linear, which means you'll be running along from point A to point B to point C without being able to deviate and explore the environment (which looks weak, so i guess that's not so bad).  you have objectives to complete, but those are to either to reach a checkpoint or blow something up.  sound familiar?  all four characters have special abilities, but they only use them when you're in control of the character.  so, if you're playing as the guy who gets extra adrenaline to kick some tail (which is the lizard-looking creature), the character that can cloak herself to sneak around is getting shot up because you have to switch to her to use the invisibility cloak.... and when you switch, the lizard guy will stop using his boosted strength to kill because you switched characters.  in other words, the special abilities are ok when you're facing only a few enemies, but when attacked by many, they become useless.  this became one of my biggest issues with the game because the special abilities could have been much more useful. another thing that drove me nuts was that the position of the character on the screen (the one you're controlling) is all wrong.  if you're shooting at someone above or below you, the camera angle is ok.... but if the enemy is straight ahead?  you character's body gets in the way and you can't see what's coming.  sometimes you have to run to the left or right just to see what's in front of you = poor game design. the rest of the game is about as mediocre as what's already been mentioned.  the weapons fire and voice acting are ok.  the weapons offered are nothing new (the rifle zoom and targeting reticule are taken directly from Halo).  nothing about this game is really inspiring and i found myself wanting to sell it about half way through as nothing new was coming along. ...	-1
If you own a PS2, there's only one wrestling game out there and that's SD4. There's no excuse on the planet for anyone who owns a PS2 to purchase this title. Yeah,  LoW2 is improved from last year's...but that's not saying much at all. It's still complete trash. I made the mistake of taking my optimism from the awesome Smackdown 4 and somehow hoping beyond hope this game would be good, too. I really thought and hoped maybe they'd make this a decent game. It isn't. Yes, the gameplay is a little better. But again, that' really not saying much. You're still randomly crushing buttons hoping something works. The graphics are cartoonish but decent enough. The whole thing still feels...choppy and uncertain. The logic behind the gameplay just isn't that well done. Supposedly a lot of it is based on timing, but after being spoiled by SD 4 smooth and fluid controls where you can actually get something done, this hails from the Stone Age. The sound? Well, at least on the Xbox can you do a custom soundtrack. You'll want that, believe me! Can't do that on any other console, unfortunately. It's mostly annoying rock music that you would never spend a cent on otherwise. The wrestling intros look and sound a lot better than the first one. That's about the biggest improvement overall. The premise behind this series is amazing, but I guess the age old adage is still true: If it's from Acclaim, steer clear. What an unacceptable, squandered opportunity this game is. I wish Acclaim would give it up, because I just don't think they can make a really good game. Mediocrity has always been the Acclaim way. Oh well, at least I can use SD 4's CAW and make all these guys anyway. The heck with this! SD4 is your hook up! Holla if you hear me!!	-1
I bought this game & have been kicking myself ever since. How do you play this stupid gsme?The controls are awful. Unless you have REAL fast hands{I don't}save your money. Oh,graphics are ugly too. You've been warned.	-1
Just a friendly warning to all CDR/CDRW/DVDR/DVDRW drive owners.  UBI Soft as a "feature" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that's a valid anti-piracy measure, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in "some" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination. UBI Soft's tech support has said that this "feature" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  "Flawed" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller. I'm certain this game deserves more than 1 star, and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install, but I can't give it more than a single.  That's a commentary on UBI Soft and their "feature", not about the game itself.	-1
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Jack and Daxter, Chrash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet and Clank, Zapper the Cricket, Frogger (the recent ones), and the list goes on. They are all the same! Sure there may be a few differences in style and gameplay, but its all the same thing, find the items, save something, collect coins, jewlels, or whatever, and use the same basic jump and attack on a bunch of the same enemies walkin around. Ty is simply the new addition to this little family, and quite frankly, it has gotten very old. The minor inovations aren't near enough to put this one up and away from the rest. But if clich adventure games are your thing, then  have a blast. But for the rest of us, something new please.	-1
the game came completely unplayable. i put it into the game system, (not saying brand names) and the game plays up until it shows the main character before the opening cut scene, then bam! cannot read disc. buffing did not help. neither did washing the game. so long story short the product came unuseable.	-1
i never recieve this product and i order this for my daughter b-day and i was mad it never came im glad i got my money back	-1
This game is extremely bad. The graphics are bad and after you beat it once you don't want to ever beat it again. You are in 2nd person shooter which is bad and your enemys dissapear after they die which is unrealistic. The multiplayer is the only thing that saved this game from getting a 1 star. Even then the multiplayer mode is mediocre. Borrow this from a friend. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY	-1
Shame on everyone who gave Nightfire 5 stars.  This game has the feel of the playstation one.  The gameplay is identical to Medal of Honor (Frontline), which was released some 1 to 2 years ago.  There are no fantastic graphics.  I bought into all the hype the reviewers were giving.  This does NOT contain the quality that Halo, Ghost Recon, or Splinter Cell type games have.  I almost feel that they should give Nightfire away free as door prizes at the cinemas.  This game will quickly be on the 20 dollar game shelf along with bloowake and Munchs Oddysee.  Do yourself a favor and do some research.  There are some GREAT games out there.  Thank goodness for XBOX!	-1
'TY the Tasmanian Tiger' is not only the birth of this new hero, it is also his death. When a character debuts, there's certain rules you need to follow. EA sure thought 'TY' would be the next big thing. Instead they get nothing but a waste of plastic shoved in a DVD case. I have several gripes with everything related to this game. First of all the ad campaign which the game completely undoes. It pictures TY walking through a hospital bedroom where Spyro, Crash, and Sonic are in body casts, suggesting that TY is so tough that he can break every bone in these famous and much more loveable character's bodies. RULE 1: Make the character cute...FAILED. Secondly, the game itself is terrible. The camera could easily give you motion sickness. Many platformer games these days have camera problems but this is ridiculous. It's zoomed in way too close to TY and it insists on keeping itself stuck to him. The character designs are nice, but they move terribly. TY and his enemies are stiff and rigid and not when you take time to look, just obviously. The story is weak: "Find your family", wow. Haven't heard that one before. The controls are evil as well. You have to practically break off the control stick to move sometimes. RULE 2: Have a good game...FAILED. Finally, this just doesn't compare to any other platformer game because it is so subpar. Spyro, Crash, Sonic, Mario, Sly Cooper, and Blinx are all much more challenging, and fun. RULE 3: Be at least even with other games...FAILED. In conclusion, I think we know why the Tasmanian Tiger is extinct.	-1
First of all, I got really impressed with the ratings and reviews this game got. But when I play it, I always double check to make sure its the same game!.  First of all, I live in Kuwait where pirated copies are only a few bucks and you find them everywhere. But I respect the time and effort put into the game, so I ordered it from outside. Original are hard to get in Kuwait. I received a box with plain two CDs without a proper pack or even a manual. Its like when you receive a free CD with a magazine. Thats really a shame for a start.  Second, I started playing the game and not so impressed with the graphics resolution and neither the animation. But thats OK I said, its kinda old game perhaps. The mysterious story may be the good thing about it. The cursor itself, environment movement, and overall playing experience is one of the worst I have faced in adventure games.  Third, the unlimited bugs who are seeming to be more difficult to beat than the game it self. I am only in the second chapter and this is the second time I am forced to repeat from an old save. The first save for some reason is not loading. The second time I moved on, I got stock somewhere where I can only move my cursor, and can click nowehere else. i.e., I have to close and repeat.  Despite our all hopes, it seems adventure gaming ages are really over. I rarely accept any single hint in an adventure game, but with this one, I already started reading hints just to move on and see where I end up... and then there was the bug that stopped me. I really doubt I will ever continue the game, and even though its only 10$, I regret them.	-1
Dont buy Nightfire. It is very boring. The missions are long and stupid. I hate all the bond games especialy the new one. The colors in the game are really bad. And the guns are stupid and not real in real life. Theres a automatic gun with a scope and you cant look trough the scope. Unless you love bond games don't buy this. The grafics suck.	-1
I had heard such great things about this game but in all reality I found it very boring.  WAY too much talk, most of it irrelevant.  I finished the game, but skipped most of the really bad dialogue.  I would recommend Syberia and Syberia II instead.	-1
Some Windows XP systems (such as mine) will experience constant crashing. As in every couple of minutes, or every time you save. I can still manage to play by saving (it usually crashes after you save, luckily), quitting if it didn't crash, and restarting, but that gets old after a few hundred repetitions. Funcom doesn't seem interested in releasing a fix for the problem or acknowledging that it exists.  It also sometimes stops responding to the mouse if you switch to another application (such as an instant message popping up), and the textures always get hosed if you switch, so that also is effectively a crash.  Also, saved games in the first slot cannot be restored, so you may find yourself confused at the very beginning.  It's a bit long-winded... sort of the longest-winded journey, and you may want to use subtitles so you can read parts and then right click in the dialog or hit escape to skip to the next audio segment. Similarly, you'll want to use escape frequently to run instead of walking, or double click to move to run.	-1
Don't be fooled, this game sucks.  I got it for my birthday last year, and it doens't match up to 007: Goldeneye (one of the best games ever made), so don't be fooled	-1
This seemed like a good game at first but later it became clear that it's more like a boring movie. Conversations are SOOOO LONG that I wanted to tear out my hair - and I like the more story-oriented games; but this is waaay too much. It starts out pretty interestingly but slumps down quickly and never returns. Graphics and music are really good (that's why I gave 2 stars instead of 1.)  The game is also unbelivably unstable - it crashed so many times that I stopped counting after 50. I must admit, I haven't finished it yet, so it may even turn into the best games ever evetually, but since it crashes all the time, I just don't see that happening. The patch is worthless, I couldn't even get it to install (I'm not sure if I have the latest version and cannot find out.)  Avoid it.	-1
(...)P>I've played some god-awful adventure games in my day, but I've got to say that without a doubt, this is perhaps the most unplayable I've ever attempted to endure.  Game of the Year?  Best adventure game ever?  I'm boggled by the reviews.  I'm a world-class cheapskate, and I'll finish any game just to say I got my money's worth, but this thing is just insufferable. Let's take a look at the blow-by-blow: 1. But it's got gorgeous graphics -- Ok, the scenery's pretty.  Know what?  So was the scenary in Myst, and that suckers a good 5+ years older than TLJ.  And let's keep in mind that when people are raving about the graphics, they're referring to the SCENERY; if it moves in the game (i.e. the characters), then its blocky and clunky.  I've seen better quality in full motion video games than the character models in this thing. 2. The voice acting -- Yeah, it's good, which indeed is a rarity these days.  I must confess that I found the main character annoying after a while, but the voice acting was certainly top-notch.  But what good is voice acting when . . . . 3. They never shut up -- That's right.  Never.  Never ever.  And every time you meet a character, you're going to find these enourmous dialogue trees, with layers on layers of their childhood, their sexual proclivities, their hopes, their dreams, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.  And, in true adventure game style, you never know which little bit is going to yield that crucial bit of information that you need to progress the game.  So you sit and you listen and you pray for death to come. 4. The story is just lame -- Maybe I just have a chip on my shoulder, but what kind of hippie, new age, gobbledy-gook is this?  What was the writer smoking?  I'm quite forgiving, particularly in the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, but this thing is just trite and uninspiring.  My favorite thing about the game is that it'll put some outlandish rule out there, which normally I'd just accept without thinking, but then they try and EXPLAIN it, and it makes no sense.  For example:   * Crazy outlandish rule -- So there needs to be a new Guardian every 1000 years.   * Me -- Gotcha.  1000 years.  New Guardian.  Check   * Expository character who can't stop rambling -- Oh but there's a good reason for the 1000 year cap: the soul can't be separated from the body for longer than that.   * Me -- HUH?!?!?! 5. It's still all the annoyances of adventure gameplay -- To top it all off, you're still going to be bogged down in the apparently unbreakable rules of an adventure game:   A) If you know what you need, but you can't find it, examine every stinking thing in your inventory 'cause it's probably hidden inside something else   B) If you know you need to use something in a specific way, but it just doesn't seem to work, you probably simply haven't placed the object in PRECISELY the right spot to trigger the action   C) When all else fails, spend half and hour blindly trying to combine items in your inventory, and waving inventory items across the screen.  With any luck, you'll stumble across the completely unintuitive Rube-Goldbergian contraption/technique that the game's designers decided was the only possible way to open a window.  If you're less lucky, it means you don't have the right item, so go revisit every location and try to pick up everything you can.  Once you've got something new, repeat blind inventory combining and/or waving until you're allowed to proceed to the next 20 minute monologue on the Balance and the Disc and the Key which is the Disc which has been broken into four which are the keys of the Disc for the Balance. (...) I hope so so that I can run out and enjoy that root canal I've been putting off.	-1
I got this game thinking the multiplayer would be like Agent Under Fire's, only with bots so i could play alone or cooperatively with friends.  What I liked about Agent Under Fire were the following options in multiplayer:  speed adjustment, gravity adjustment, Q-jet, Q-claw.  All of these things have been left out of Nightfire!!!  Granted, some of the new options are kinda cool, such as the remote-controlled helicopters and tanks and especially the guided missiles, but these things lose their charm pretty quickly.  I am VERY disappointed.  The movement in multiplayer is EXTREMELY slow, which is just accentuated by the fact that many of the levels are impressively large.  Aiming is awkward.  In general the gameplay pales in comparison to HALO or Timesplitters (1 or 2).  The single player levels are larger and better looking than AUF's, but I'm not really into running around trying to find computers to plant Q-worms on and such, so I lost interest fast.  This is a rental at best, since even if you enjoy the missions you can finish them all in a few sittings.	-1
Nintendo has shafted me again, first with a n64 that had no third party support. Now the same thing has happened with my Gamecube. I own all three new systems plus 5 older systems and I work for software etc. I know my business and our sales speak volumes. XBOX sales have picked up while Gamecube sales have dropped. well there is always the next system. For Gamecube I had to buy memory cards, a keyboard, an ethernet adapter, Then I bought an XBOX. Unlimited memory, and the only thing you might have to purchase is a dvd playback kit(which is cheaper than a Gamecube memory card). I own a real dvd player and im not stupid enough to use my console as a primary dvd player. Gamecube doesnt even have this option. This is 2003, 99% of the world doesnt have to use their game console as a dvd player. I found that most of the games on Gamecube are on XBOX except on XBOX they contain extras, far better graphics, sound and some even add online play. While online you can chat in every game, no need for a keyboard. Gamecube only offers 1 game with online play(shame on them). XBOX has over 235 games available and over 250 for this year alone, so games is not an issue. Finally someone has built a better system then ps2 and Gamecube. ps2 is good, gamecube is better, but the loading times, muddy jaggy graphics, no dolby digital,and now its losing all its exclusives to xbox. ps2 & gamecube exclusives are getting fewer and the ones they have are seeking ways to get their games on other systems. GTAVC for example, rockstar is planning on releasing a side story to gta only for XBOX, so you can expect great graphics and much better gameplay on xbox. With games like Halo 2, Tao feng, Project Gothom 2, Dino Crisis 3, UFC Tapout 2, Dead or Alice Chronos, Brute force, Rallisport 2, Mech Assault, Unreal Championship, Panzer Draggon Orta, and many more exclusives, the proof is there if you look, developers are putting their best games on XBOX and then dumping the left overs on ps2 and gamecube. The XBOX exclusive games put anything the ps2 or gamecube has done to shame. Halo was released over a year ago and there still has been nothing from ps2 or gamecube that even comes close to the graphics, sound, story and even the online play rocks even though its not offical through xbox live, you have to play through gamespy. The new 800 pound gorilla is here, and its name is xbox.	-1
While this is a good game it dosen't compare to the PC one, MOHAA.  Go buy MOHAA and don't waste your money on this one.	-1
Get the Xbox version, which has better graphics, Dolby 5.1 surround sound (makes a HUGE difference), and easier controls.  Even the controller vibration seems a little more engaging on the Xbox.	-1
I highly suggest that you do not buy this game. The first level is far out cool, but the rest of the entire game is you, a lonesome soldier against hundreds of Germans. The weapons are not cool, the game is too easy, and the storyline does not follow World War 2 at all. The graphics, are...eeh... okay, but could be much better. I had this game for about a week, and already I got bored. Plus, I beat the game in three days, flat, so that kinda tells you that it's a [bad] game. And the controls! JEEZ LAWEEZE!... They're impossible! The aiming system is terrible, and the guns are completely inacurate. Don't buy this game.	-1
Cumbersome, awkward controls. Stiff, robotic and unnatural animation. Sub-par graphic design. It reminded me of a 3rd person version of the 1997 N64 game Goldeneye, more than anything else. I read a comment in 'The Official Xbox Magazine' in their review of the upcoming Metal Gear Solid 2- Substance: "It's good, but it's no Splinter Cell." I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. They're acutally 100% correct, but not in the way they meant it. The demo made it painfully obvious that Splinter Cell isn't worthy to scrape the grime from under MGS's toenails. If you want to play a quality stealth/action game, skip this weak attempt and go for the King of the Genre, MGS.	-1
There are a few things this game does right, but one of the most important things it does wrong. The world that you are supposed to be immersed in is a failure. It's very robotic and way too simple. I guess the best way to put it is that it just feels fake. An example of a well done world is the game Fable. Now these 2 games are very different but my point is, when playing Fable, you kind of believe that this place could exist, if only in fantasy. But with Splinter Cell, this world could never exist, fantasy or no fantasy, because the overall execution is just plain crappy. I would look elsewhere if you're looking for a really good game.	-1
Splinter Cell is one of those games I wish I could finish. The graphics are so beautiful that my friends and I have spent hours just playing the lighting engine, the way curtains flow, the way you can interact with objects... that much is masterful. The gameplay, however, can often be the opposite. There are a lot of reviews, and a lot of ground to cover, so I'm only going to address some key points here. My first draft of this review was also way too long. Trust me, this is the bare bones details of my review. My beef starts with Sam's weaponry. Sam's standard pistol is the most useless pistol I have ever encountered in a game, especially because it's this game. In most conditions, the pistol is so wildly inaccurate that by the time you've moved into killing range you might as well just make the effort to go for hand-to-hand combat. Other times, for no apparent reason, you can take down a dozen guards with as many shots. However, the game tends toward the former most of the time. This is critically saddening because it ruins so many moments. For example, the game's lighting engine means shooting out a lamp will darken the room. To get the jump on some enemies, shoot out the light and when they come to investigate you'll have the upper hand (night/thermo vision... engage). But have fun trying to shoot that light. Your wildly inaccurate pistol and quirky game physics mean it might take you anywhere from one shot to a dozen and agonizing moments of aligning your crosshair until you manage to take out the lamp. My personal record is wasting just under 2 clips before a ceiling light FINALLY blew out. Keep in mind, it only takes one hit to shatter any glass in the game. His other "tools" would require some spoilers to cover and are thus omitted. Mostly, the other weapons and gadgets are excellent. Adding to that, the game revolves around a Metal Gear Solid style alert system which ranges from brilliant to unforgivable. Sometimes, saving yourself from game over is a matter of being quick and making sure guards don't make it to alarms if they notice you. Other times, it's walking around a corner only to not notice the camera setting in the dark until you hear a blaring alarm and "Game Over". Restart, be more careful, lean around the corner to spy on the action... oops, you caught the camera when it was looking in your direction. Game over. Retry, sneak up, whip out your pistol, lean around the corner, camera's facing away... okay now shoot. Miss. Again. Again. Three more. The rest of the clip. Oh joy, Game Over again. And therein lies the big problem for me- having to restart so much. At times, you'll breeze through whole sections of levels with smooth spy precision as though it was second nature. But unless you're very lucky, 90% of your gameplay time will be retrying the same hallway over and over and over because of any number of problems. The game relies on a "checkpoint" system where you only get to save when you accomplish certain goals. This means, unfortunately, you may spend ten minutes stealthily clearing one section only to open the wrong door at the wrong time and get Game Over before your save. Sorry, Charlie, do it all over again. When you're "in the groove" with this game, it's sheer heaven. The technology is fascinating, the story is enveloping, and using your array of moves and tools is a blast. However, even for a gamer as patient as I am, you're going to need serious dedication to finish this game. As it stands, this game was utterly unplayable for me past the first few levels- one of which took on the order of a full day filled with cursing and various ill-natured gestures toward my television to complete. And in the end, I will only ever touch this game to play around with the gorgeous graphics and gizmos.	-1
I was hearing sooooo much about this game and all my friends were saying how great it was so foolishly I just went out and bought it...bad idea. Don't get me wrong i do realize why many people like this game, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. I like games like halo where you can go rampaging , but in this game you barey get to shott its all about stealth and sometimes you have to cross a like ten foot room but it takes you like 20 minutes because you can't have sensores see you, im just not that patient. Although I absolutely hate the gameplay, the graphics are amazing.	-1
They give you a stealth suit, map, pda, laser microphone, night vision goggles, fiber optic camera--but they don't give you a friggin' compass. It's real helpful when Mission Control says "Your objective is to the East", and you have zero ability to determine just where that direction is. Without a reference/compass, the map is virtually useless. Run out of bullets? Too bad. While neatnick Sam can pick up and throw bottles and other trash, he is inexplicably unable to pick up or use enemy guns. I bet you feel pretty safe hiding in the dark, down a 100' pitch-black corridor. Safe enough to shoot an enemy at the other end of the corridor. Good for you, he's dead. But--oops--his buddy just ran around the corner, and inexplicably starts tagging you with every shot. Nevermind that you shot your target with one bullet from a silenced pistol, you're in pitch-black darkness, and the enemy tagging you with 100% accuracy has no way to see in the dark. This game prides itself on realism. It's a real shame that the game itself actively works to destroy suspension of disbelief. I quit after the first mission.	-1
What a disappointment.  This game just isn't what you expect.  I purchased this game for my young daughter, thinking that she would enjoy playing a game that included all of the characters she enjoys watching on the Nick channel.  Guess what?  She played it for all of ten minutes, found that she couldn't control her character becuase she couldn't follow the action and hasn't touched it sense.  That was worth forty dollars! Simply put, the game has too much activity for younger children...heck who am I kidding, even I had a hard time trying to figure out who I was, where I was, and what I was doing. If your looking for something enjoyable for your youngster, try the Rugrats Royal Ransom game.  That's much better for little hands! Bottom line:  D-	-1
Here is a case of a great game gone bad to the console.  At least you can choose from 5 different boards or themes.  However, the game quickly becomes redundant watching your piece move the alloted squares.  Even though you can speed through the walking it still is quite boring.  Trading and building are almost impossible as you can't read the streets on the screen that allows you to do that.  Overall, spend your money on something else.	-1
Personally I think this game isn't as good as it could be, I'd suggest buying Mortal Kombat instead really. g!	-1
Was not able to play it.  It was my mistake I though it was for xbox 360, did not realize it was not, my mistake	-1
I'm a huge Superman fan. You know the bit read the comics since I was a kid, absolutley love the movies, watch the TV series etc. That's why downing this game is such a let down. This game is only for people who won't believe anything with the "S" can be bad until they try it...like me. First off I wouldn't recommend this for the younger audience namely because of the difficulty. The game pretty much just throws you in the game and gives you quick messages like "Oh yeah! Here's how you do this!". The controls are controller breaking frusterating. You confront ten enemies at once and find yourself getting shot by all while trying to manevuer to get a lock on one. Unlike the PS2's Superman: Shadow of Apokolips flying isn't half as fun. I.E. no cool Christopher Reeve arm movements, no loops, no 180 degree fly-rounds...you fly forward...real fast...sometimes you turn. The character models are terrible...people in-game look like bulky blobs with little expression. And who did the dialogue for this game? I don't remember Superman ever shouting "Holy Krypton!"...if he did I'm sure he was under the influence of something. Honestly unless you love Superman and just have to find out yourself don't buy this game. If you want to play a good Superman game go check out the PS2's Superman: Shadow of Apokolips. Sorry Supes...but this game was a let down.	-1
this is the most broken fighting game of all time, but it has namebrand characters so i can see how it got popular...as a fighter is it worthy? not really..it survived on names only..if it were generic characters it would be a low rated game.	-1
First of all, let me say that I've never played any other Mech game, but I'm sure most are better than MechAssault. The game has some good points such as the graphics, which are very good, and the animations of the Mechs exploding and the buildings collapsing, but that's basically where the enjoyment ends. The single player is frustrating. You have to earn your mechs and you can't custimize them one bit. The best way I found to kill opposing mechs is to run around in a circle around them and keep shooting. The jump jets last too little to be effective and the online gaming is boring. You could litterally hold the trigger button and fall asleep and still have a very high chance of winning. You're initial ammo is infinite but you can pick up power ups to get stronger finite ammo. Health power ups rarely fill up your health bar the whole way and you have to find 4 or 5 to get back to full health. Basically the game is shallow and boring. Its just pretty graphics. You run and shoot. You cant custimize you cant stratigize or anything. Not to mention the people online are [bad]. If you want real strategy and real fun, pick up ghost recon or Halo and if you don't have xbox live, use XBconnect (look it up on google). It works for almost any game that has system link compatibility and its free.	-1
What were they thinking? It has little next to nothing to do with the Red Faction, which what was the original was all about. There is no real POINT to the game. and with all the twists and turns, you don't know if you're the good guy or the bad. And if all this isn't bad enough, they make it short. you can beat it in a two day time span. This is not worth [$$] I can assure you that much. While the game is somewhat fun, it is basically a different game. It only slightly mentions Red Faction a couple of times. You see a character or two of the Red Faction, and that's about it. The game doesn't take place on Mars either. That was half the thrill of the other one. You don't really know what your going to run into in mines that are underground in Mars. The geo-mod in this game is okay, but there is a lot of mesh wiring under most surfaces, making it impossible to pass through. Rent this before you consider buying it. It will save you a heart attack wallet wise.	-1
I got this gadget dingydoo for 5 bucks at Blockbuster and thought it would be a good deal. I figured out why this game was only 5 dollars. I didn't get a complete set of the Donkey Kong thing. I got 6 cards but 2 were just dang repeats. So, I can't play that. The cards can't be scanned easily and often take about 10 tries to make it actually work. The Pokemon cards you scan through only gives you info you already have on the card and the Animal Crossing cards are useless if you don't have a Gamecube. Manhole stinks because it is no fun. And yes it does work on the GBA SP, some people say it doesn't, but I guess they just don't have an SP or used it on their Gamecube without one of those link cables. So, you either can't play something, can't play something fun, or look at information that you can get by looking at the stupid card. But, with a price of $5.00, (at Blockbuster) I have no choice to give this stupid piece of junk a worthless 2.	-1
Superman The Man of Steel seemed like a super game at first. It controls well, has decent graphics, and has all of Superman's powers. However, I didn't even finish this game, since it got so boring and repetitive. It had great potential, but every misson feels the same, and they all are. They are all basically "go to point a and destroy those robots". And after you destroy those robots in point A, it makes you go to point B,and over again. You can fight villans though. If you are a hardcore fan of Superman comics and stuff, you may enjoy this. But I can say that I didnt. It could have been so good too. Its the most authentic Superman game i've ever played, and probably the best one ever. Thats not saying very much though, considering Superman's dark videogame history...	-1
I first rented this game before I had Live just to see how it played, and I was dissapointed. There were no midlevel saves and it was long and tedious to destroy enemy mechs. Now that I have Live, I decided to rent it again since almost all critics seem to praise this title as the best Live game available. I can honestly say that these folks have never played anyother Live game such as Ghost Recon or Unreal Championship!!! Though online is better, it does suffer from the same aspects as the single player mode, it is way to hard to destroy mechs. It is a good idea to play through the single player campaign to unlock the stronger mechs and so you can see the stats of other mechs available, but it will end up being more of a stuggle than fun. Also, the enemy can always hear what you say on Live, which elliminates a large amount of potential strategy, but does allow for stronger communication to others. You can press a button to talk only to teammates, but very few bother with this. This game isn't compltely bad though, playing mutiplayer and watching 8 mechs explode in your face is quite entertaining. And there is alot of potential to this title. Some improvements I'd like to see in MechAssault2 would be 1st person perspective (sense of size would be better), a health bar over opponents so you can see how much life they have left, midlevel saves, and voice chat switched so you always talk to your team and have to press a button to talk to enemies. Eventhough if you ask people online which XBL game they feel is best 99% say Ghost Recon, many people here seem to enjoy this title. So maybe I'm not seeing what they are. I reccomend picking up GR with your Starter Kit and if you have a few extra pennies, go with Unreal as well. But at least save this one for a rental.	-1
This game is HIGHLY flawed.  There's a HUGE misktake with the game: this game is on the blue-bottom disc format (CD-Rom). If you are unsure what that means, let me explain.  Playstation 2 games are on two different formats: DVD-rom, and CD-rom.  On a CD-rom, the bottom of the disc is blue, and the CD is lighter than a DVD format. When ANY Playstation 2 game is on CD-rom format, the PS2 WILL have problems reading the disc.  This is because the disc is lighter than its DVD counterpart, causing the disc to wobble when spinning in the PS2.  This causes loading problems, game failing to start, and often, damage to your system.  You read about this problem A LOT in game magazines. It's unfortunate Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 is on the CD-rom format.  The gameplay is great actually.  However, 75% of the time when you turn on the game, it won't start, guaranteed.  It says "Disc read error."  Unless you want to restart your PS2 four or five times just to start the game, this game isn't worth the money. I know what some people would say: there is a solution to this.  There is a solution actually, but it's risky.  One solution to make the CD-rom disc heavier (for PS2 to read it properly) is to put two equal pieces of tape side by side next to the center hole.  There's a risk to this, though.  What if the tape is too light?  That means error on PS2.  What if the tape is too heavy?  That means an error also.  Besides, who wants to put some tape on their games?  It's not worth it! Look in the lower-left hand corner of the game's cover (the picture on Amazon.com).  There's a tiny "DVD-rom" logo.  Unfortunately, this is misleading.  The game is NOT on DVD-rom format.  I don't understand why there's false packaging labels. I know all this because I ordered the game off Amazon.com (brand new).  When the game arrived, I put the game in my system.  Guess what?  The PS2 wouldn't read the disc!  My PS2 is fine--all other games work properly.  I had to restart my system around five times to get the disc working. If you must buy this game, but it on Dreamcast, or Xbox.  Please, stay away from the Playstation 2 version, unless you are tolerant of restarting your PS2 four or five times just to get the game started.  Be warned.	-1
I remember before I actually bought this game, I had only played it a couple of times at a movie theater. When I got the PS2 version about a month ago or whatever, I was really excited. I popped it in, loaded it up, I tried to find Mega Man, ... 24 characters huh? Looks like 24 to me! I [felt disconcerted]. Then, after a while, I discovered an option called "Secret Factor". And I saw Mega Man in thar, and went "Huh? He's a HIDDEN character. Funny, because I could've sworn he was ready to access in the arcade version. So I had to beat the game, get some points, and I bought Mega Man. I was happy for the moment. Then I was able to get Captain Commando and M. Bison and Cammy. So I played some more, got some more points, I went to try and find Felicia and Morrigan, and they don't show up. I play t some more an hour later.... They still aren't there. Another 5 hours later.... Yawn... I'm going to bed. On a final note:This game {isn't necessarily the best} Why settle for this game when you can just play DarkStalkers or Power Stone??? Anyone that says this game rocks [could be mistaken].The original is a little better and more fun than this [one]. Please do me a favor people, and [reconsider if you should so desire]	-1
What are the chances of having 4 friends with a copy of a GBA/3DS & zelda? None This game isn't made for one person & 1 bot is not good enough Also this is not zelda Its a generic treasure finding game with zelda slapped on it	-1
The one I received was very clearly pirated as the moment you turn the system on you are prompted by their pirate call signs before it even shows the Nintendo logo.	-1
The game works half the time. Its loose in its cartridge and will freeze the system if you touch it slightly while playing. Other times it won't load at all and requires it to be removed and reinserted several time for it to load.	-1
I rented JetX2O with the hopes that it would be essentially another SSX Tricky, but this time on water instead of on snow. ...and I was severely disappointed :-( For a game which combines speed/placing and tricks, SSX Tricky is definitely the pinnacle of the extreme games genre.  SSX Tricky also has numerous characters with a great variety of personalities, plus a massive number of customizable features for the characters.  JetX2O, on the other hand, has fewer characters, fewer choices in equipment (jetskis compared to snowboards), and a far less interesting array of personalities among the characters. In its favor, JetX2O does have some intriguing courses.  There are pop-up ramps, trick bonuses, numerous obstacles, blind and semi-blind corners, and a good variety of scenery and locales.  This certainly helps to draw the player into the game, but only to a certain point. Where the game TRULY lacks is in the ability of the player to identify with the characters, to find points of interest with the characters, and to essentially WANT a particular character to represent her or him in the game.  A large part of this "lack" is due to the voice acting, which is certainly not impressive by any means. Ranking above the game's characters, the announcer (emcee, narrator, sportscaster, or whatever) is not really at all interesting during the events themselves.  The introduction to the different event venues is definitely interesting, and seems to be somewhat improvisational (almost in the same manner as much of Robin Williams' voice acting performance in portraying The Genie in Disney's Aladdin) - and this works rather well in the venue overviews - but this same "inner fire" seemingly disappears once the events get underway.  This is unfortunately in VERY sharp contrast with the announcer in SSX Tricky, who is seemingly very much into the many events and is just as much a part of the game as the obstacles and the ramps and the trick bonuses themselves. Another significant drawback to JetX2O is that the game's menu interfaces all seem rather "clunky" at best.  Obviously, extremely little time and thought was afforded to the menus, as there is no apparent fluidity when progressing from one menu screen to another.  The character selection menu and the jetski selection menu are definitely better than the rest of the menus in the game, but even these do not convey the feeling of an extreme sports game; certainly, the characters move about and chatter, but something still seems to be missing which almost prevents the player from wanting to continue on to the events themselves. Overall, JetX2O is truly left to only those few diehard jetski fans who are also diehard console gamers.  Whereas SSX Tricky (and SSX before it) was able to easily draw in a vast array of gamers - including those (such as myself) with no experience in snowboarding or any extreme sports - and present a beautiful mix of events and characters and venues and "extras" (such as the announcer), JetX2O fails in almost ALL these aspects.  This game is worth a short rental, but is certainly NOT worth buying for the majority of potential players.	-1
anno 2004, this game is depressingly ugly to look at, so ugly that it hinders my gameplay experience. the ratings for THIS zelda are far too high and imo only based on nostalgia. I have played (u)moria for hundreds of hours, so i'm not the type that sees graphics as the most important aspect, but come on, zelda, no. link moves waaay too slow, the selection system is unintelligible. it may be that is was among the first rpg's but that does not mean it is one of the best! The story may be great but playability is too low to grab me at once (in contrast to phantasy star, which is really far better and about the same age). my advice : borrow it, and if you have no friends with gba, rent it. do not fool yourself and pay >$5 for it.	-1
THis is one of the werst games i've ever played. the game play is horable. o man...(sry to the fans of this game this is just wat i think) i would not sug jest you buy this game it is a waist of money. Thats all for me.	-1
First off,I want to say that I loved wild arms 1 and 2;as such I was expecting to love wild arms 3....WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT! One extremely annoying new "feature" was the random battle encounter gauge. Unlike 2 where you would get a "!" above your head so that you could run away from a random battle,WA3 only lets you do this 10 times,then you HAVE to fight. Another bad feature was the fact that everyone uses guns;you can hit with your fists(when your out of ammo)but it does such lame damage that it's not even worth trying. Also the personal skills system was changed for the worse(having to equip an item,fight so many battles and then having the item dissapear after you've learned the skill) The characters and the story were also short of my expectations for the series. While janus & co.(bad guys) were sometimes funny and sometimes despicable,they were nowhere near as great as say liz & ard from part 2. The game also felt like it was TRYING to make a story just to give you a point to do things,whereas the previous two installments had great stories to them which also just happened to be games. The only good thing about this game is the graphics;not the ahh and ooo 3D type,but the fact that all of the characters looked like they were hand painted with water colors,and that was impressive. The only noticable music in the game was the traditonal wild arms opening that's heard during the train scene after you play all four character intros. The very start was sung in voices with a hymn-like effect;very nice. Everything afterward is just hum drum,average run-of-the-mill. All in all Wild Arms 3 is just another video game sequal that bombed!	-1
Well I am very disappointed...very. Here are the bad things. - Horrible graphics - corny storyline - no real voices - same old battle system. what else? Well for one the graphics repeat, the music is very annoying..it just keeps playing over and over the same part, and they don't even explain the complicated menus..you have to figure it out for yourself. The graphics are flat, and more like cartoon characters..obviously the creaters tried to make it look "cute" and save some time and $$. There is a reason it's cheaper than the other games..because it is cheap. it isn't worth the rent money either..	-1
I love RPGs. The PS2 has produced some really excellent games for the genre including Final Fantasy X, the Shadow Hearts series, and Disgea: Hour of Darkness. Wild Arms 3 is not going to be joining this list of RPG awesomeness any time soon. It's not even going to be joining my list of decent RPGs. This game is terrible, and I just could not finish it! Trust me I tried and there was a period of two weeks when I couldn't bring myself to even turn the game on.  I thought a western-themed RPG would be something really unique, but I was wrong. This has got to be one of the most cliched things I've ever seen. It's the third in a series that appears to be rather popular. I did end up hating this game, but strangely I'm not totally put off from playing a Wild Arms game ever again. Maybe since this is the third game, it's just an unfortunate casuality of sequel-itis.  The Good:  The music's pretty good. It's appropriately whistlely and twangy like the fare you'd find in most spagetti westerns and really sets the western tone.  Fighting on horseback! This only unique from a visual point of view. The game still plays in exactly the same turn-based Final Fantasy-esque way as if you were on foot, but it looks really cool as you race across the desert fending off creepies.  Save Anywhere! You can provided you have an item called a Gimel Coin, but luckily those are easy to find.  The Bad:  Cliched plot. It starts out with promise. Your four heroes meet up during a train robbery when some burly gunmen try to steal an artifact belonging to this Indian Shaman tribe called the Baskars. Classic Western! Then the adventurers, called Drifters, team up and take an assignment from the Baskar's head Shaman to awaken the four guardians of the planet Filgaia so maybe the desertification of the planet will stop. It's down hill from there. Suddenly, instead of a Western game, I'm playing a cliched find the four scared elemental crystals/dragons/betamax VCRs quest.... but with firearms! Soon our foursome discovers that this weird demon cult is out to infuse the planet with evil energy and transform it into a demon world or some other rot by using guardians and ancient artifacts. So they set out, to discover why Filgaia is dying and play follow-the-bad guys. It's almost like playing Final Fantasy VII over again, and I never liked that game much in the first place.  Characters that come right out of anime central casting. The characters are very archetypal and never try to break out of their mold. You have Gallows, a ne'er-do-well Shaman, who learns some bland lesson on freedom, heritage, and self-actualization on the journey. Brainy, tough guy Clive, who might have been a better drawn character if his marital troubles were explored in more detail. Jet Enduro, surly anti-social amnesiac, and worst of the bunch Virginia Maxwell. For some reason they make her their leader even though she is the least expirenced of the bunch. She's naive, gulliable, and not all that smart trusting people she should know better than to trust and walking into obvious traps. She's one of those annoyingly perky types and her "Come on guys! Let's do our best for Justice, Truth, and blah blah" is more Big Bird than Clint Eastwood. She's also looking for the dead-beat dad she hasn't seen in 10 years. The anime feel is helped along by the video sequences (complete with corny songs) that sandwich the game when you begin and end it during each period of play. Trust me. It's frickk'n annoying after you've seen them ten times.  Sandcraft battles. During the game you get a sandcraft vehicle. If you run into a monster in this thing, the way the battles plays out is very different than on foot or horseback. That's not good because they battles are so bloody slow that they can last for over five minutes each!  The Ugly:  Healing Items are hard to find. Healing Items are scarce, so it becomes neccesary to ration stretigically. There are some sections of the game that are so hard that having a big cache of heal berries is the only way to stay alive. It adds challenge, but since I didn't enjoy the game it just it that more annoying.  Search system. If you want to find something on the map, you need to get directions first and move slowly across the map sending out some kind of sonar to make the ruin, town, or whatever appear. It's time consuming and also makes the game extremely linear.  Boring Level Design. You'll send more of you're time trekking through the various ruins that litter the landscape. In the ruins, you solve various puzzles ranging from easy to what am I supposed to do here? difficulty. A critic once said level design was key, and Wild Arms 3 makes me see how right he was. All the ruins look exactly the same. I know I'm throwing a switch in the ruin in the North, but I did the exact same thing in the ruin to the South which also had a box puzzle like the ruin in the West.  Get my point? It feels like I'm doing the same thing over and over again. I'm not traveling to a Forest of Doom or a Cloud City of Eternal Happiness. It's just ruins and towns, and they all look the same!	-1
The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring was a wonderful idea.  Black Label games has a good reputation and their game the Thing seems to be one of the reasons why.  This game however is a definite pass.  You start the game as Frodo which would be fine except that you aren't given any real sense of what to do.  There is no map of the shire so all the quests you need to perform mean that you have to wander around to complete them rather than going straight to where you need to go.  Also the load screens are many and take a VERY LONG TIME to get through.  Maybe a mini game during them would help...  I've heard that there are more errors and problems in the Xbox version so I decided to leave the game at the fact that they should have taken more time with this one.  The game's graphics are not what they should be.  The cut scenes are more what the graphics should be.  Gandalf has been rendered very poorly in this game.  The game could have been SO MUCH MORE.  Hopefully the Two Towers which comes out on Thrusday will be better.	-1
I'm about 40 hours in to the game. Graphics are HORRIBLE, you have to read ALL the dialog, there is no dubbing of any kind...The areas you explore are linear.....a 5 year old could navigate these areas. Whoever developed the maps should get fired. The story is excellent, but they make you go through it 3 times! Gets boring. This is one of those games that I had to put down and come back to out of boredom. I would not reccamend this game to anybody...	-1
i really liked how they did it based on the book and the movie it was fun to see the shire and the local pub.  i thought the graphics could be alot better. rivendale was a rippoff because the water didn't move 3 demensional  they threw in random levels and charcters which i didn't like. i hated the fact their voices were not the actors in the movies. spoiled it. but it came very fast nd well packaged!! i would highly recommend this seller. just not the game. (oh nd there were glitches at the end)	-1
When the ps2 was first released, this was one of the very first games to hit the shelf, because at the time ps1 was still booming, so there weren't many ps2 games. I got this game hoping it would be like Big game hunter ultimate challenge for ps1. Cabela really should have took the time on this game. but they didnt, they seemingly just made it and threw it altogether without a thought but to gain profit. Now i aint downing Cabela because they make the best dad gum hunting games. but this was just horrible. I love to use the bow on hunting games, and the bullistics on this game are just impossible and make the game horrible. You have to get within 70 yrds with the compound for a clean kill, 30 with the recurve in real life. Sadly, they didn't seem to realize that the stealth meter is so lame, It was obviously made to be hunting with firearms. Rifles to be specific as the shotgun is about like shooting a handgun on that game. So let me refrain, give you a little idea of what your buying.  First gun i used to go hunting was the 223. handgun that shoots rifle loads. i crept up on a blacktail and glassed it with binoculars, at about 180 yrds. I was crouched, which is supposed to up your stealth meter, but unless you don't move, it drops real low even while crouched, so you'd be better off running. the Buck was laying down with its back to me, i pulled out my pistol and realised i was too far away for a decent shot, i sprayed scent cover and crept forward. As soon as i pushed the analog stick the stealth meter dropped down and the buck up and bolted. Frustrated i fired a shot at it with the 223.and bullet cam was on, so i got to watch the bullet go straight to the ground at the bucks feet as he bolted over the hill and into  the blue. Leaving me to think how bad the ballistics on the game sucked and how that should of hit him. a 223. doesnt begin to drop until 250 yrds. i was well within the range of a straight shot but failed, due to bad ballistics. The bow is impossible, you'll never get close enough to actually hit your target, the game aint designed that way. Finally after too many failed shots to count, i began to just chase em' down with the truck or atv and jump off right by em' and pluck em' like a madman with my 357. which if thats cabelas game designers idea of close range hunting, thats extremely funny. However the 270. rifle and sly planning led to me nearly beating even this impossible caper of a game. It was designed for hunting with the rifle, But people want a variety of firearms so Cabela thought, Hey, Bows and handguns! well, they don't work. They will kill, its just you better pray for a lucky shot. However<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cabela-s-Dangerous-Hunts/dp/B0000B0MN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cabela's Dangerous Hunts</a>&nbsp;definately corrects the stealth and ballistics problem. you can actually Bow hunt and enjoy it. I was stalking a Whitetail with the recurve, and i stopped to scope the deer with the binocs, when all of a sudden from behind i heard rustling leaves and by the time i turned i became the hunted by a 1,000 pd Grizzly. i try to shoot it but it was right on me so i pulled out my knife and attempted to fight it, only to end up retreating to the water, waiting for him to charge again... PURE ADRENALINE THAT GAME IS! Cougars, to wolf packs to Rhino attacks in africa. Your definately on edge. Dont buy this big game hunter, it stinks. But if you want to see a better of cabelas works, buy dangerous hunts.	-1
I recently borrowed this game from a friend. While I don't like first person games I'd heard that a little ways in it became mainly third person and had some awesome battles. I thought "Okay I'll suffer the first few levels and then be treated to some great action.". Well I was wrong, I was tortured the first few levels and then only somewhat amused when the switch happened. I hardly even play 1st person games and can tell a good one from a bad one and this is bad. Also the controls in both perspectives use the control stick and the D-pad heavely. How on earth can I use both at the same time!!! This ones for Star Wars fans and FPS lovers only. Despite some cool battles in 3rd person it just wasn't that fun.	-1
I made a terrible mistake and bought this game for $49.99 the day it came out. If I waited a month (which I wished I did) I could've bought it for $20. This has to be by far one of the worst games I ever played. Needless to say I played it for about 45 minutes and quit, I never played it again. I thought it was boring, graphics and movement were terrible. Honestly if someone gave me this game for free I wouldn't take it. I love the books, all 3 movies were great, this game shouldn't exist. I wasn't too impressed with the other Lord of the Rings Games either but this one is definately the worst out of all. Try to avoid this one at all cost.	-1
The story is interesting enough I suppose but do I ever hate the battle system and the forced camera angles as you move around.  The battle system and the camera angles ruined the whole game for me, I couldn't play it...and having a donald duckesque character as my body guard really doesn't help me take this game any more seriously.  I am a huge fan of Suikoden 1 and 2 and this game ended up disappointing me to the point of wanting to stay far far away from any new Suikoden releases.	-1
To me, the appeal of Suikoden 3 to so many people is one of the world's greatest mysteries, right up there with Roswell, Stonehenge, Easter Island and JFK's assasination.  Why did so many people enjoy this game so much?  My theory is that someone switched the discs in my game when I bought it, and that I was actually playing a fake version of Suikoden 3 that really, really, REALLY sucked.  Well at any rate, I'll review the game that *I* played.  Suikoden 3 is terrible.  It is one of the most boring games I've played in my life, and I played all the way through it.  Up to the very end, I kept telling myself that the game MUST get better (based on the reviews I read).  Yep, right up to when they started rolling the credits I promised myself the game would get better.  It didn't.  Elizabeth R. Powell's review is actually a pretty good description of my experience, though I would disagree with her contention that Hugo's plotline was worth playing.  It wasn't.  The worst part of the game hands are the game triggers (those events that happen when you enter a certain place that "triggers" the game to progress).  Some of the game triggers are so random it's ridiculous.  Sometimes, the game doesn't even tell you what you need to do next (like the chapter you spend recruiting people, and you have to talke to EVERYBODY in ALL the towns you visit).  I spent countless wasted hours running from screen to screen trying to figure out how to progress that damn game, baffled because apparently I was supposed to know I to go to some remote corner of the castle to speak with some character I've never even met before.  How in the world was I supposed to know to do that?  And of course the overly high random encounter rate, coupled with the boring terrain and terrible music made the whole experience dreadful.  The story hardly makes up for the game either.  In fact, if the game had good gameplay, I'd probably complain about the boring storyline.  The uninspiring characters make you think Konami game designers flung darts at a personality chart to come up with their characters.  All in all, not even worth a rental.  But I do implore you, if you are the least bit curious about the game based on the other reviews (reviewers bribed by Konami no doubt, CONSPIRACY I tell you), RENT, don't buy, the game.  Don't worry, I'm sure you won't mind if you don't finish it in time.	-1
This is absolutley terrible, what were they thinking? The graphics alone rank! I shouldn't even refer to them as graphics but rather "cartoon" graphics. The mission and storyline are bogus and lame. I dare anyone who says this is a great game to play EA's Two Tower or Return of the King then play this one. If you don't mind wasting your money, then go for it and buy it, but if you want great games that enhance the LOTR book and movies, go and buy EA's Two Towers and Return of the King.	-1
I hate this game. The only reason I have it is because when I bought a Spyro game it was free. I played it probably 8 times before I found out its was boring and impossible to beat. I have never been a fan of Lord of the Ring but i thoght the game would be ok. I was wrong. It was horrible. I have never played it in over 1 year. Even if you are a big fan of Lord of the Rings I think your going to find this game boring and stupid. Please tell me if my reveiw was helpful or not.	-1
to sum this up quickly, this is one of the most bland, boring, slow, and inspirationless RPGs i have ever played in my life. the battles reach a new level of monotony and the EXTREMELY stiff animations, bland backgrounds, and a total lack of texture variety contribute to this. the hugely frequent random battles are a huge turn-off, as you'd think RPG designers all realized that random battles are not fun. the story is absolutely ridiculous and in the five or six chapters for all the characters that i trudged through, nothing happened that was at all interesting. nothing. of the three main characters, only Hugo is worth playing, since he's the only one that EVER shows emotion or does ANYTHING worth watching. Chris and that mercenary guy whose name i forget are complete jokes. they're the most pointless character designs i've ever seen. their stories are absolutely NO fun. don't even get me started on the secret chapters that you can unlock. Tom's, for example, is a quest across the same three towns where you recruit people. you don't know who you can recruit, so you have to talk to everyone in every town, and sometimes buy an item for them to convince them to join you. Fun. as for the music and sound, they're just as sub-par. sound effects are SPARSE, and the music is as uninspired as it gets. i actually kept this game thinking it would get better considering the raving reviews (and the awesome intro), but it's absolutely pathetic. a massive tarnish on the suikoden series.	-1
Common sense to me in making a good video game sequal,would be sticking to what made the previous installment/s great...NOPE! That ain't gonna happen in this age! For some reason game developers are almost sadisticaly compelled to add "new" stuff and completely throw away the tried and true elements that veterans of a series have come to know and love.  Suikoden 3 is the fourth RPG that I have played for the PS2 which originated on an older system. And like the other three(Wild Arms 3,Legend Of Legia 2 and Final Fantasy X)it [bites] because they change way too much;almost to the point of feeling like an entirely diffrent game instead of a sequal.  I hate to say it,but I think the death of good rpgs is upon us. Fun and traditonal gameplay is being replaced with eye candy and foreign concepts. I'd rather play good ol' dragon warrior on the 8bit nintendo than these peices of junk!  I STRONGLY advise lovers of the first two installments of suikoden to rent this game before buying it.	-1
Actually, rent two games, because you'll finish this one in under 3 hours, and won't want to play it again (NO REPLAY VALUE WHATSOEVER!!!).  There's enough to keep you fairly entertained for that time period, but boring battles, lame bosses, and an overall lack of challenge will make you wish you had looked deeper than that "official" Tolkien product.  Another complaint that I have is the lack of autosave at the end of each mission.  The fact that this game so religiously follows the book and works some of the minor passages into entire levels saved me from rating this game a 1. This game is perfect for people too lazy to read the first book in the trilogy, but who want to see all the stuff that got left out of Peter Jackson's first LOTR film.  Even so, my advice to you is this: save yourself [some money]by going to see The Two Towers instead of buying this game.  You'll be far more entertained.	-1
Well, I'll be honest and I haven't even been able to get out of the shire.  THE *bad word* BLACK RIDERS ALLWAYS CATCH YOU! I gave this game a two simply because it might've gotten better had I not given up after 20 tries, but trust me, don't get this game if you're like me and have no patience.	-1
This is a very mediocre game based on the book.  You will probably enjoy reading the book much more than playing this game.  If you want a "Lord of the Rings" game, I highly recommend "The Two Towers" which is much better.	-1
With the looming release of the blockbuster in the making next installment of the Lord of the Rings film series, it was inevitable that the license would be delved into video games.  The recent wave of LOTR licensed games have ranged from great (LOTR: The Two Towers for PS2) to godawful (LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring for GameBoy Advance), and here we have The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring for the PS2.  Contrary to what you might think, this game has more to do with Tolkien's first installment of the books than it has to do with the film.  You can control Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf at different parts in the game; each of which has similar regular abilities and some special exclusive ones as well.  Graphicly speaking the game is half decent, as is the sound, but the control is so frustrating and the camera angles are outrageously bad.  Half the time you'll get killed just because the camera angle wouldn't let you see the enemies right.  Not to mention that once you strip away the Lord of the Rings license you'll find that the game is really a simple hack & slasher with a hot license attached to it, and nothing more.  All in all, even hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings will find something to be disappointed about with this.  My recommendation is to skip this and pick up Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers for the PS2 for some real fun.	-1
Wow, what a let down.  Here's the short version. 1.  Horrible control.  Very awkward, especially the camera.  Worst camera I've seen in a game like this in a long long long time. 2.  Short/small/linear.  Laughably short.  I beat this game in 5 hours.  No cheats, no hints,....so short, so easy, just.... laughable. Go buy/rent Drakan the Ancients gate.  Uses a similar engine (the good parts done by surreal), but just a much much much better game, in every way imaginable. I certainly wouldn't recommend buying this, and I be hard pressed to even recommend renting it, it's not even worth the 6 bucks it cost to rent....what a let down, avoid at all costs.	-1
I loved the Shinobi series, and its games were amazing thus far, but this one doesn't really live up to its predecessors, and on top of that, its difficulty can rip a metal grinder into shreds. I liked the fact that the main character spoke in Japanese, but anyways, to the important part here... Most enemies are exaggeratedly hard to defeat, and not even the original arcade Shinobi from 1987 was *this* punishing when it came to defeating enemies, and that is saying a lot, since I actually like the original Shinobi arcade game and the Revenge of Shinobi Sega Genesis installment. While I don't mind a bit of challenge, I definitely don't find being ripped to shred every time I play the game in seconds with that obnoxious game over screen my idea of fun. No thanks, I think I'm going to just replay Super Metroid, thank you very much.	-1
About a year ago after hearing loads of repeated mumblings concerning this titles difficulty and as someone who loves a challenging game, I decided to purchase this. Boy was it waste of my 6$.  I'm not really much of a stickler for graphics but I will say the games graphics were decent. In terms of presentation, this game fails at everything environment-wise. To go into the previous statement a little further, I will say that the games environments are all VERY shallow and lacking in creativity. I can't tell you how many times I saw the exact same dull environment design throughout my limited playthrough.  The subject of gameplay is the sole reason why I gave this game 2 stars. Devil May Cry debuted on the PS2 in 2001 with hack and slash gameplay that was engaging, deep, and rewarding. Fast-forward to close to the end of 2002 and we have Shinobi; a game with an inexcusable extreme lack of depth and repetitive soulless gameplay.  I can't tell you how fast this game bored me with the SAME 1-2-3 combo combination; Unlike Devil May Cry, you can't vary your slashes or work your projectile weapon into your "combo." I could even accept that the sword constantly drained my health as I idled, but that fact added nothing in terms of feelings of tension or incentive to keep playing. In addition, it was kind of cool to pull of those multiple kills at first, but after I did it the 20th time in one level, that feeling of excitement lost its luster FAST.  Now, I played about 6 levels, but after that I could go no more. I must again reaffirm it has NOTHING to do with difficulty, but this gameplay just led me to keep asking myself, "..so does it ever get deeper? Does he get newer abilities as he progresses? Does it EVER...?" and it hit me like a rock when I realized the answers to all my questions was this: NO.  It's for this very fact alone that I really don't think I'll ever beat this game.  And that's it, a very short review for a very narrow game. So, as a recap for interested parties, this title is for those who don't notice gameplay that never varies and never gets deeper as well as those simple minded enough to be wowed by 60fps graphics. For the rest of us however, there's to many games out there are ACTUALLY fun to play.	-1
I remembered playing Shinobi (the original arcade version) when I was a kid and it was the first game I ever beat. That was a great feeling and I'll never forget that. I was really looking foward to this and I bought it the first day it came out. All the other reviews are correct, after level 2 it got repeative (even the graphics)and really difficult. If anyone decides to play this I recommend gameshark codes, you'll need them. I like challenges but this was more frustrating than a challenge. I was very dissapointed with this, they could've done so much better. This game I wished I waited till the price went down, definately not worth the $50, but I went ahead and bought it anyways; bad mistake on my part. Some will like this and some will not.	-1
From a long time Shinobi fan, I am very dissapointed in this game.  Its a pure action game with some cut scenes to highlight the hacking and slashing you will do throughout.  Combos are intresting way to rack up points and power up your sword, but when you fight so many enemies at once and they block all frontal attacks, its gets very annoying.  You end up jumping/dashing around everyone to try and get behind them but then the camera only does an adaquate job of keeping up and you lose half the enemies behind it - meaning attacks from the side you can't see. Graphics are pretty nice for the PS2, but its definetly showing its age.  The textures do get pretty bland and unimaginative though.  Running through a city with pale purple neon lights and almost non-existant signs or moonlight or interactable objects besides a few boxes and vending machines is boring. Sound is average, no tunes stick out in my head and I usually forget its even playing after ahwile. Story is medicore at best - not really even worth mentioning. Controls get the job done. Even though I own all the other shinobi games on home consoles, I would have to recommend this as a rental.  Go pick up one of the genesis titles for some better platforming action.	-1
This game is way to hard and repetitive. Your sword eats away at your health if you don't feed it. The graphics aren't that good. The levels look alike. Hard to master the controls. The story is stupid.	-1
Beware!!!! i watch all the reviews and thought it was a good game WROGGGGGGGGGG i played for two stages and that was it for me. lost all interest right away. so BEWARE this is a waste of money. im not going to waste writing more because it doesnt ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzZZZZ sorry i felt sleep, i try to play it again zzzzzZZZZZZZ	-1
Whatever happened to the Shinobi plotlines in the old Genesis games such as Shadow Dancer, Legend of Shinobi and Shinobi III? What happened to Joe Mushasi and his faithful dog sidekick? What about the evil Union Lizard Corp? None of that is in this. It's just generic hokum and the Ninja dude is the only one to save the day. The graphics are very cool and the soundtrack amiable enough but the gameplay is so boring and gets very old and tired even by the second stage. It was cool slicing the bad folks in half the first few times but when the game takes time out to show them spurting blood for the fifty-millionth time it seriously gets on your nerves. There's no variance or long-lasting appeal to this. It makes me long for the old-school Shinobi. Side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as Shadow Dancer are still better than this. It's very dull. It looks good but it plays poorly.	-1
If you want to play the ultimate Shinobi game, go to the used game store near your house and pick up Revenge of Shinobi for the defunct Sega Genesis.  Believe it or not, this game has more depth and... dare I say it... better graphics and sound (!...) than the new PS2 version. I never got past the second level of this game, not because it was too hard, but because the game is insanely boring.  Every bad guy in the first stage is exactly the same, and there are no other challenges except to stab and slash your way through them.  The first boss is ridiculous, and you don't even get to [dispose of] it before some woman comes and helps you out. Then when the second stage started, and it looked exactly the same as the first stage, with the same enemies and backgrounds, I said, "Enough with this." Revenge of Shinobi had creativity, unique challenges, well-thought-out levels, good music, excellent graphics and more... none of which this version has.  Perhaps if the creators of PS2 games would spend more time on gameplay and less time on cinema-style scenes between levels (that no one ever watches anyway), we'd get better games.	-1
After seeing this game on TV commercials & on GTV (Games TV on Digital Cable CH.136) I decided to BUY this instead of renting first which you should not do. Anyway, The graphics are looking 32 bit (Genesis) and the gameplay is just like a typical sega genesis game! I agree with the guy below, Falling in a pit is gaurenteed more than your satisfaction with this game. You can tell this was a rushed project! The cutscenes are the highlight of this game, they were cool but the graphics during gameplay ....! The enemy AI is worse than Ninja Turtles & GTA, They might as well be mannaquins! The obstacles were harder than the enemies. The first boss is a helicopter which is lame! I highly recommend Way of the Samurai & Devil May Cry 2 instead if this game. Dante will be able to run along walls in the upcoming sequel! Rent this before buying!	-1
Graphics 9/10: This game has great graphics but it doesn't use the full power of the Xbox. Gameplay 5/10: If you want a good FPS then just get Halo. If you really want this game get it for PC. If you get it for PC, my friend says you can get third-person for guns and everything. If you get it for Xbox, you can only get 3P mode for the lightsaber. Sound 0/10: You don't really hear much sound except for the gunshots and lightsaber swings. Replay Value 0/10: Their is pretty much nothing to make you play this game again except multiplayer. The multiplayer is pretty boring. BTW I have never gotten the internet to work. Overall 3.5: Gets old after a while.	-1
I won't go into the games other aspects as the other reviewers have done a good job desbribing the story, controls, and overall gameplay. What I will touch on is the AWFUL character animations and overall mediocre graphics. Maybe I'm just jaded from playing Splinter Cell but the characters here are laughable, especially the death animations. The AI is also pathetic. More than once did I have at least 3 to 4 Stormtroopers run from me in terror. Add in the frustrating puzzles plus repetitive music and you have a game that (i found to be) barely playable.	-1
this will not be a comprehensive review, kids.  i just wanted to throw a few things out there that were, unfortunately, not included in video game mag reviews (but then again, no one from Lucas Arts is paying me for ad space, ya dig?). i played the PC version of Jedi Outcast at a friend's and really wanted to pick up a copy on my way home that day - it played well and looked sweet!  that didn't happen due to work and school schedules and by the time i had any time to play a few new games, this puppy was out of the x-box = woo hoo!  i was stoked that i could play this game in the comfort of my living room using a controller that works with my larger hands. another bonus was reading several publicized reviews stating that the x-box version was every bit as good as its PC partner.... nope. the graphics for the x-box version are kinda sad.  no, they're not Atari 2600 bad ("Go little yellow dot, go!!"), but both Lucas and Gates should be smacked silly for not utilizing the graphical prowess this machine has.  the only conclusion i can come to is laziness and the assumption that hard-core fans will buy any game with the Star Wars license (which seems to be the case if you're played many of the early SW PC games.  ech).  if you ever saw the difference between the PC and PS2 version of Max Payne then you know what to expect.  it's a shame, really. the gameplay is not so great, either.  for a big chunk of this game, you're playing a lackluster FPS, at best.  i really wanted a fast and furious shooter that took place within the Star Wars universe.  what i got was a lame FPS with goofy "puzzles" that annoy more than entertain (such as: just trying to figure out where you're supposed to go, finally figuring that out, but now you can't open the door you know you have to go through, and then spending too much time backtracking to find the switch that you wizzed past that opens another door somewhere else that leads to yet another panel that allows you to finally move on.  this would be more interesting if there was action involved to break up the hunt for the hidden switch, but you killed off everyone on this part of the map within two minutes.  snooooooooze).  i really, really wish that someone in the various reviews i read had mentioned that there was a large puzzle element involved... and that they're pretty lame.  if this game had been released on N64 way before GoldenEye, it would have been pretty cool... but we're way past that, now. ((and good luck if you get stuck with a friendly character that is tagging along for that level/map.  they're really good at getting themselves shot and if you try to run ahead to protect them, you either get wasted or they run in front of you and you waste them = game over. repeat.)) making it to the point where you can use a saber is really not worth it, imho.  i only made it that far to try and justify that price of buying this game new = waste of time and a big mistake on my part.  the multiplayer is kinda fun b/c you can throw a ton of bots on the map with both weapons and sabers.  it's chaotic, but pretty much any other game with such options will blow this one away.  there are a lot of maps and game types to choose from but, again, the game doesn't look that great and you always have the feeling that you should be spending your time on something more deserving (like pulling nose hairs or waxing the carpet). if you're a diehard fan, this game may still be worth it.  you will see familiar characters and the sounds are all the same, but you should demand better.  this is a licensing deal and not much more.  the x-box port was either rushed or no one cared - either way, we lose.  please, RENT this first if you're still curious... or, if you live in Cincinnati/N.Ky, there will be one more used copy on the market very, very soon.	-1
If you buying this game hoping to play it on an XBox360, don't bother.  It will not play and there is no update to make it play.  I can't really rate it because of this problem.	-1
I've observed lots of mixed feelings for this game. At the end of the day, I think there's some confusion over the target audience for this game. Details shall be discussed under the Gameplay heading.	-1
Graphics don't make a game, they merely add to the enjoyment of the game play and interaction. This game is ridiculous. The volleyball portion it basically a cpu controlled mess that involves more luck than strategy. What's fun about a game in which you have to constantly bribe girls to partner with you in matches you have a better chance of losing that winning? Plus the real rules of volleyball aren't even applied to this game. And what's up with the weird deuce rules when there's a tie score? But honestly, this game isn't really about volleyball. It's digital Barbie dolls for guys. You earn cash to dress up the girls in outfits your girlfriend would never wear on the hottest day of the year in private.  The totallity of this game feels more like a collection of bad mini games rather than one cohesive one. The fact that this game is getting 5 stars from consumers saddens me, because it proves that T&A, cgi or not, is enough to get people to by something, and enjoy it somewhat. I don't mind the digital skin..I'd just need digital substance to go along with it. I'm glad I didn't actually buy this crap.	-1
This game gets a star because it proves one simple point customizing video game women is more fun than customizing video game cars.  however both can only hold ones attention for a limited time cars for about 2 minutes and women for about 5 minutes.  anyway down to the game play.  there is no story at all.  the "story" was definately an afterthought so im not going to even consider it.  If you have really poor reflexes enjoy playing handheld games or are a fan of computer games you will really enjoy playing the actual volleyball matches.  people who like portable gaming will casue it involves smashing buttons and people who like computer games will cause you really only need to use 3 buttons similar to using a mouse.  the computer seems to fluctuate randomly between one computer being incompitent and the other being proffesional which is the most fun to play against to both computers being lousy which is ok or both being so good you can consider it cheating which is no fun.  that about sums up this game	-1
This is volleyball? The actual volleyball part of the game is When I hear the title "XTREME" Volleyball, I want solid gameplay, but you get none of that. And what makes it extreme anyway? Sure the bodacious babes are a big plus, but the gameplay relies on just hittin the ball over the net with 2 buttons and hoping you get points. I just felt the lack of interaction. Heck, Tecmo didnt' even bother to apply the scoring rules to this volleyball game.  Only A and B buttons are used.  There are basically only 2 things you can do on offense, hit the ball up in the air for your partner, then spike it over the net. Fun? Um, not hardly. The computer basically decides the matches and who wins. There is no strategy involved, it's just game for looks and busty babes, nothing more. This is Tecmo, the makers of Ninja Gaiden and DOA Hardcore? Anyway, then after a boring day playing volleyball, you have to go back to the lame Island mode and waste time going through useless and boring places on the island. You try to earn the love of other girls by buying them swimsuits and gifts. Why would one find this enticing?  I'm sorry, this game sucks. Sounds like a harsh description, but if it wasn't the redeeming factor of the sweet graphics, this game would be a total disappointment.  Is it the worst volleyball game ever? No. But when you pit it against the quality of Sega's game on the Cube, it's just further proof how bad the volleyball engine really is.  The graphics are amazing though. The ladies look better than ever and if they were real I'd defintely want a few dates. It's actually the same engine Tecmo used in Dead Or Alive 3 for the XBOX. You'll recognize one of the beaches being taken directly from the 3, and it looks amazing. Seagulls flying in the background, warm sand curdling your girls feet, and the ocean hitting the sand over the horizon. There are also new beaches, jungles and islands to play volleyball. Once again, lush scenery, fantastic animations and great graphics are nice, but when the gameplay sucks, who cares? For the guys that bought the game strictly for the babes, they might appreciate the "Gravure System" as Tecmo calls it. On days when you want to be alone with your girl, you can take her somewhere alone on the island and just look at her basking in the morning sun. You're thoughts of being there with her might be fun for awhile and mind you it is ultra realistic. You can zoom in on her, change the camera view and take her to different locations. For added visuals, you can also give your girl a nice tan and hook her up with countless bikinis. You can buy tanning oil in the accessory shop and you can watch them over time get a lush golden tan from the sun. If you want to keep them healthy, you can also buy sun block. Sigh. This sucks. I'll say it once and I'll say it again, visual splendor alone, this game rocks, but the game sucks, it really does.	-1
Dead or Alive Volleyball, is a pretty weak game. It does has beautiful graphics; the women wearing bikinis and sun bathing or playing volleyball. ... The backdrops are beautiful as well, with nice beaches and island spots. I also had a bit of fun with the casino mini games included. When you gamble and win at the casino games, you earn money to buy gifts for your girl/characters- buy them a new swimsuit, candy, flowers. It tries to simulate interaction with a virtual girl, but it is very limited. The volleyball game (which is the whole purpose of the game) lacks responsive controls, and has very bad camera angles. The bad camera angles ruin the whole game because when you are playing volleyball, either your character or ball will leave the play screen and then you end up losing points! Terrible. The music and sound effects are generic but they can be turned down. Pros: +beautiful women +beautiful back drops +casino games Cons: -junk controls -camera angles sucks -you cannot adjust camera angles -generic music -weak sound effects -not very exciting Overall this game is below average, it tried to implement lots of good ideas, and the casino games was a nice bonus, but the negative points affect it badly.	-1
This game is boring .the volleyball is just way too weak to keep your attention for more than a few hours.   the girls are beautiful but they all speak japanease(which really gets annoying). its more of a game of dress up the ultra hot dolly than a volleyball game.the most nudity in the game is the thong bikinis that you can make them wear.   The casino is also quite boring youve got poker,blackjack and a host of similar slot machines.   The consensus between me and everyone i have let use or play this game is that the chicks are hot but how long can you look at a pixelated hottie before you realize the game has no substance.	-1
I'm about to commit an act of treason against men everywhere. I'm about to give DOA:EBV a negative rating. But I honestly need to. This game, as advertised, only serves as eye-candy for perverts and a waste of money for gamers everywhere (much like the XBox system itself). Now, don't get me wrong, there are definitely some good things about this game. The disc makes a nice frisbee and I'm sure there are some great posters out there, but beyond that, it does little in the way of providing a good gaming experience. But then again, so little of the XBox games do, anyway. I suppose "Panzer Dragoon Orta" will probably be their one and only breakthrough, but beyond that, they have little to offer and will thus go the way of the Sega Dreamcast. There is one truly great thing about the XBox, though: it makes a truly excellent doorstop. Happy playing!	-1
This game is only marginally entertaining for about 2 hours.  The volleyball "gameplay" is only two buttons.  The casino is incredibly boring.  The graphics are nice, but so what?  How long can you look at cartoons in bikinis?  The HUGEST, most GLARING failure of this game is that there are NO character endings, i.e., there is no goal to achieve in this game.  You don't even have any real incentive to play volleyball at all, except to break up the monotony a little bit.  I can't believe this game was actually made and marketed.  Mine's going back to Best Buy immediately.	-1
This game is only for hormone-raging 13 year old kids who can't get their hands on actuall pornography so its aimed towards their hormones. The game is actually not a good game. If one of your "not-as-smart" friends has the game you might want to try it, but its not worth the money nor time to rent or buy. The ONLY other reason to buy this game is IF you are a DIE HARD Dead or Alive "collectors" fan.	-1
Without a doubt, this is a very beautiful game. Great graphics. However, what I really expected from this game was not just spectacular (and sexy) graphics, but a killer game engine that would overshadow other Beach Volleyball games (on any system), just like Dead or Alive 3 had excellent gameplay for a fighting game (and spectacular graphics). Unfortunately, this is not the case. The gameplay comes down to pretty much push one of two buttons. Even the camera isn't up to the task. More than once did I have to dive for the ball off screen... If you are a fan of the characters: Get the game. If you just want to look at half-naked girls: Buy a magazine or look at the screen shots here. If you want to play good volleyball: Look somewhere else...	-1
Boring	-1
Really disappointed to receive a completely scratched up copy when it was suppose to be in "very good" condition ! Game does not play at all! Hoping I get my money back or a copy that works!	-1
Where to even begin... The graphics lag often. The story is far, far, FAR too short. It feels like fanfiction written by a fourth-grader. The controls are slightly wonky, especially if you've been playing Spyro on the Playstation all your life. Unless you have plenty of money to throw around, don't purchase this game NEW. Purchase it USED, preferrably for no more than $5, because that is all it's really worth. If you want it for game-playing purposes, you will be sorely disappointed, especially if you are a fan of the previous three games.	-1
This is just not a very good game.  It's something to do if you already have it, but if you don't own it, don't buy it.  If you want something like this, I'd suggest getting "Spyro: A Hero's Tail".  It's similar, but they did a better job.  The story involves Ripto taking all the dragonflies and scattering them all throughout the different levels of the game, and Spyro must get them back.  I'll admit, the game can be a little fun at times.  There are a lot of dragonflies to find, mini games to play.  There are also a bunch of gems to collect if you're in to that sort of thing (though, I don't recall ever actually needing them except once in world 1).  Spyro also has a variety of different breath attacks, like ice and lightning, which is nice.  And there's a variety of levels, like the jungle or the thief hideout or the cloud level.  My biggest problem is this game doesn't seem very well-made.  It just feels at times like the people who made it didn't care.  And if they didn't care, I don't really, either.  My first issue is really more of an annoyance.  I don't get why the dragonflies try to escape from you.  You're trying to help them, and Spyro must chase them down and use his bubble breath to capture them.  It can be quite annoying trying to catch the darn things and take a while.  Did Princess Peach run from Mario?  No.  Did Princess Zelda try to escape from Link?  No.  Why do the dragonflies feel the need to fly away from me!  The game can also be glitchy.  I heard the GameCube version isn't as bad (and the loading, while slow, isn't as slow as other versions), and I never had big glitches, but I had them.  Once Spyro got stuck up against something and kept moving like he was running, and he wouldn't stop.  I pressed different buttons, and I tried to pause the game and leave the area, but couldn't.  Finally, he suddenly stood still.  I think there was another time he did something similar when I tried to get him to talk to someone.  Often times, the ground disappears in one part of world 2.  They're not a really big deal or anything.  It's just these things should've been fixed.  And maybe I'm nitpicking, but I think the voice acting is often not that good, and the character design seems just odd.  The characters are just always moving and bouncing and looking all over.  They almost look like they're stretching sometimes almost.  It's just bizarre.  It almost feels like they were left somewhat unfinished.  So while this game can have its fun moments, I really wouldn't waste any money on it.  There's just a lot of little things that add up to me having a big problem with it.  I just really get the feeling the developers didn't care, and I don't want to play a game like that.  I will admit something, though.  I think this game's version of Sparx is adorable, despite not being able to understand him.  If they could've shown the same creativity and thought as that, maybe it would've been a better game.  Like I said, get "Spyro: A Hero's Tail" instead.  It's similar, but nearly everything is done better.	-1
After the other 3 Spyro games on the PS1 and how AWESOME they were, we got this one after. When I was younger I was excited, but now that I'm a lot older, my opinion has changed about the game.  Pros +Still the old school Spyro gameplay - collecting gems, collecting a key item (in this game it was dragonflies) +Can shoot bubbles, ice, and thunder (my personal favorite) instead of just fire now. +Has all the abilities from the past Spyro games so you don't have to necessarily reobtain them.  Cons -Only one world, with 8 levels (9 if you count the 'home' world) -The 8 levels can get dull and hard to find, especially if you're missing 1 gem. -The minigames are kind of boring and repeated over the course of the 8 levels, except in the luau level with the drums, and the jungle where you had to climb that massive tower. -The game gets laggy in a speedrun stage. -The bubble breath is really useless, only used for catching dragonflies. -The 'wing shield' is also extremely useless, used in one level to get one dragonfly, plus the hit redirection is backwards. -Moneybags is only met ONCE in the entire game, and it's in the first level. You only need to pay him 200 gems and that's it. Gems aren't used in the rest of the game except for 100% completion, and you don't get the gems you paid back like you did in the other games. -The final boss is kind of hard at first but really stupid once you figure out the pattern (or just go on GameFAQs and find out how to kill him) -The game took less than 10 hours for me to beat. It is really short.  I honestly thought this game could've been a lot better being on stronger and better hardware than a PS1. They did pretty good with the GBA version that came out BEFORE this one. I don't see why they couldn't follow it. In conclusion, don't bother with this game unless you are a major Spyro fan, or if you can snag it for $5 or less.	-1
As you guys probably know, I am an avid fan of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.  The PS1 enries were really enjoyable for all ages and helped define my childhood and preteen years.  However, as usual, when a franchise is given over to different companies, there is always a dip in quality and this is a prime example of a game that the developers didn't have that much time to work on.  This is the same case as the first Rocky game for the same console generation along with Sonic 2006, Tomb Raider: The Angels of Darkness, & the NES version of Action 52, and it, beyond any doubt, shows.  Here are the aspects were I feel this game could have improved on had the developers been given more time to refine it.  Graphics:  I know this is more like a personal preference thing and it matters the least, but to quote the Angry Video Game Nerd to some degree on the transition to 128 bits, the graphics are even cheesier and more cartoonish, but not the worst I have seen.  In contrast, take a look at the original PS1 trilogy; 96 bits less but 100x more appealing to the eye.  Controls and Gameplay:  I admit that it is nice that Spyro has virtually the same moves as its predecessors with a few new ones such as wing shields and different breath abilities and it isn't the worst controls I have experienced, but it feels a little bit sluggish while the original PS1 games feel more fluent.  Plus, using the bubble breath to get the dragonflies is more tedious than using your ice breath to get fireflies in Season of Flame.  Load Times (PS2):  Just like Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, the load times are pretty long considering that they were released when the PS2 was in its earliest years.  At least the Gamecube version and the Greatest Hits revision sped up the load times though maybe increasing the disc speed on the PS2 may help but I haven't tried it yet on this game.  More Levels and Worlds:  They planned on having more stages and worlds for Spyro to traverse in and retrieve the dragonflies but they really had to cut corners due to a very short amount of time to make this game.  Because of this, it is really short and only worth it for a rental out of curiosity.  Glitches:  As you guys probably know, every game has glitches, no matter what.  Sometimes, people like finding glitches because of what the Nerd pointed out in his Game Glitches video, such as finding errors that the developers missed or exploring outside the rules.  However, it becomes a problem if the glitches get in the way of the gameplay and not activate upon command, which is what the PS2 version suffers from.  For example, the Cloud 9 stage crashes and the Jurassic Jungle layout may disappear, just to name a few.  At least the Gamecube version fixed the fatal glitches and left in the harmless ones like swimming through air and phasing through the gate Shadowcat style, for example.  And last but not least: Resolve the cliffhanger from Year of the Dragon about Gnasty Gnorc and Ripto teaming up on another attack against our main heroes.  Just solely adding Ripto on stealing the dragonflies doesn't have that much dept in execution and isn't worth it in the long run.  Here is another nitpick that I want to point out.  Even though Pamela Hayden returns as Bianca, is it me or was her microphone messed up during recording?  This is because her voice was a little bit squeakier than its predecessor for some reason.  Here is also a saving grace.  Once again, the Stewart Copeland music was excellent as usual.  I recognize his signature music style anywhere.  He is well-known for being the drummer for the band known as the Police and did a fair share of film scores and the first four console games of this series during a hiatus with some notable examples being Rumble Fish and TV's The Amanda Show as well as a few mistakes like Good Burger and Highlander 2: The Quickening.  In conclusion, it isn't the worst game I have ever played, they at least tried with that amount of time they were given, and the Gamecube version is an improvement over the PS2, but it still makes you wish you were playing the PS1 trilogy instead.	-1
Enter the Dragonfly has good graphics and fun gameplay, but it is not going to be a challenge for experienced players. The characters are often fun and silly, and they constantly bounce up and down in an annoying manner. There are nine levels, and each one has some sort of challenge portal(driving a tank, racing against the clock or rivals, sliding down a slide, etc.). Spyro uses fire, ice, elctric, and bubble elements. He also can use wing shield, charge, and horn dive. For those that do not know, it focuses on puzzles and challenges, not on combat like the Legend of Spyro series. Overall, while it is relatively fun, it will probably be short-lived entertainment for experienced players.	-1
after renting this game to my dismay i found ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING new or different about this port.the graphics are the same as it was 3 years ago on the defunct sega dreamcast. what's worse..no online option and you can't play your own souindtracks to replace the horrible jazz ecentric BGM during the battle stages. the music was MUCH MUCH better on capcom's previous efforts I.E. MARVEL SUPER HEROES, MARVEL VS CAPCOM OR EVEM XMEN VS STREET FIGHTER (heh, no wonder why i still have my SEGA SATURN as well as my DC) but if the XBOX is your only system then your'e left with only one option buy it, otherwise avoid..btw where's the gamecube version...oh you mean there isn't one for the lamecube??...oops!	-1
I mean look, Spyro was good in his early days, but now, he's garbage.  The spyro saga has took a turn for the worst.  I mean this game grows boring reel fast, and I'm glad I rented it.  Spyro was one of my favorite games, now it's one of the best games that can spell G-A-R-B-A-G-E!!  Do not enven spend ur money 2 rent or spend ur time 2 borrow, this is the game that tarnished the shining saga.	-1
If your looking for the old Spyro you won't find it here. Vivendi Universal has totally trashed the Spyro legacy. Anything that can be wrong with a game is in this one. Looks like Vivendi Universal released this game before they even tested it because as far as I'm concerned this game is unplayable. Long load times and frame rate problems are just a few of the problems. I played this game for 10 minutes and I could not play it anymore. Don't waste your money. Buy Insomniacs new game Ratchet & Clank. It's 10 bucks cheaper and 1000 times better. FYI - Insomniac was the original developer of Spyro.	-1
I was so elated to find out Konami was releasing a new version of the SNES classic Contra 3 for the Gameboy Advance.  To my disappointment, I didn't find myself having as much fun with this version as I did several years ago on my old 16 bit machine.  My biggest gripe is that the game walks the fine line between excessively challenging and unenjoyably frustrating.  What were the developers thinking?  You can no longer toggle between weapons; rather whatever you pick up is what you shoot with.  This wouldn't be a major issue if certain weapons weren't useless in certain situations.  There are also no more bombs so you better pray you have quick reflexes to get you out of those super tight spots.  Aside from the difficulty issue, the only other major flaw is the archaic password/save feature which is totally inconvinient for a portable game.  Everything else is actually O.K.  The game looks just like the old SNES version and has aged quite gracefully making for a really nice looking portable game.  Controls are tight and alleviate some of the stress from the frantic learning curve.  If your looking for an insanely hard shooting game (and I mean INSANELY HARD) for those long car rides, by all means Contra Advance is a perfect choice.  For those looking for a game that is a little more enjoyable and rewards skill rather than luck, you should go somewhere else; and for the old Contra fans, pick it up used for some old thrills, then pull out your SNES and really put some time into the old game.	-1
Like the headline says, but the fact that I have been playing this story for over 8 years now makes this a waste of time. I turned it off after an hour. Enough said. Buy Resident Evil 4, its the best one since the Original. Maybe the best of all.	-1
After playing this game, I was left with the feeling that they are running out of ideas. The fact that you are forced to control two characters is innovative, and at the same time detracts from the Resident Evil experience, because you are no longer alone, which is part of what made previous titles in the series so scary. All around it's just an uncreative game. They attempted to make up for lack of good puzzles by throwing tons of enemies at you, which you of course don't have enough ammo to kill them all, so you're going to take a lot of damage. Rent this one at the most.	-1
I see a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews on this game. I don't know maybe there playing another game because from what I see from this game is not at all impressive. While the concept and graphics of the game is good, the control of this game is where it falls way WAY short. Controlling your characters is a task in itself and are too cumbersome, simply walking/running in narrow areas can get frustrating, I won't even going into aiming to kill birds that fly off the screen only to come back and attack you from the entirely other direction. I don't know if this was done intentially to make the game harder than it really is, but it works!! On top of that the characters seem slow to respond to your actions, when your trying to pick something up, you have to press the button and wait to see if it responds, you press the shoot button, and your characters just stand there while getting attacked, when your attcked by something an get pushed to the previous screen, you can still be attacked even though you can't see where it is so you can shoot it. Top this off with barely enough ammo to kill the cheesy zombies that grab you and take 7 shots to kill with the pistol. I'm sure the controls take some getting used to, but this game is just too boring to want to learn the controls. The game it self moves entirely too slow and it littered with too many useless and corny cut screens. Cut screens when you pick up something, cut screens when you walk up or down stairs, cut screens when you climb a ladder, cut screens when you open a door, cut screen when you switch character controls. And if the game wasn't already SLOW enough, text goes across the screen slooowly and there is no way to make it go faster. "A..R..E.T..H..E.......F..A..I..N..T......S..O..U..N..D..S......O..F.........F..O..O..T..S..T..E..P..S.....T..H..O..S..E.....O..F.....S..U..R..V..I..V..O..R..S.?" is NOT something I want to sit through EVERY SINGLE time I load a game.  I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this game....If this game had fewer cut screens was more faster paced and most importantly, had controls like Xbox's Splinter cell, then maybe this would be a very good game. But as it stands, my second GameCube game is a waste of my time and money. I guess I was spoiled by my Xbox's splinter cell and even my game cube's Metroid Prime. And to think I thought splinter cell was cumbersome when I first played it. HA! Don't waste your money unless you absolutely LOVE the resident evil series.	-1
I've been a on again off again fan of RE for some time now. I like the concept of the games, but I just don't like the games. RE 2 and every game after it was just too boring. Code Veronica for Dreamcast was the best of the lot in my opinion, so that upped my memories of the games a little bit. Sadly, upon playing RE for the Gamecube, all the truth about this series came flooding back. I rented it for five days, played it for two. First off, this game just isn't scary anymore. RE2 could creep me out like nothing since the original Alone in the Dark. This game however, just feels so "been there, done that.". The first zombie I met I tried to shoot and kill, big mistake. Surprise, it killed me despite being pumped with several rounds from my handgun. So, annoyed, I restarted. This time I ran and that worked. After reading up in some walkthroughs, I found out that you spend the vast majority of your time doing just that, running. "Survival Horror". I was depressed. None the less, I figured I'd give it a try. For two days I ran from everything in sight. I tried not to chuckle at the "horror" of it all, and kept running. Even when I finally got the firepower to fight back a little, the game had lost appeal. And of course I use the word "firepower" very lightly, ammo is rarer than gold in just about any RE game out there, and of course you'll never get a useful unlimited hand to hand fighting tool except for your worthless survival knife. Why can't your character effectively shoot them in the head? Just give me some dang weapons and the ability to use them! I really can't see why anyone would enjoy a game of this type. I can't see the appeal to anyone but the most casual gamer or hardcore horror fan. My advice, avoid this one completely. If you're a big RE fan, rent it. But don't buy it without trying it first or you may regret it. - Rirath_com	-1
All that I really have to say is are there not enough wrestling titles??? I mean seriously there have to be at least 20 wrestling games from the past 5 years. Sick.... No seriously I think I might throw up. :( Hasn't WWF made enough money on all of their sell-out items yet?	-1
This game was one of the worst I've ever played.  The graphics are decent, but they just can't match the old Contra from the NES.  The day that they realize this, and stop making stupid games like this one, the better.	-1
It has a co-op mode, but neither of us were that into it. We played it for a little while, but just gave up.	-1
I was addicted to Contra as a kid.  On the old NES, there was hardly a better game, and I spend hundreds of hours on each one, fighting, shooting, blowing stuff up.  I was so excited for this one I could hardly stand it, and I didn't care if it was 2-D.  In fact, I WANTED the game to be exactly the same as the old ones. I bought the game, put it in, and started to play. Then I got bored.  Fast.  I couldn't believe it.  I played for about 20 minutes and couldn't take it anymore.  I shot some stuff, but it just wasn't fun.  One of two things happened.  Either this game is horrible compared to the old games, or I just plain grew out of Contra.  I hope it's the former. This game is hard, but in a frustrating way.  I don't recommend buying this game--rent it once and you will be sick of it before it's due back, even if you're a die-hard Contra fan.	-1
Panzer ORTA is yet another game release from the "new" Sega, and like many of Sega's new releases, this game was hyped beyond belief before its release, but ultimately PDO turned out to be mediocre at best, much like Toejam & Earl III, JSRF, Gunvalykrie, etc. The potential for this game to succeed was staggering.  WIth the fine legacy left by the Sega Saturn trilogy and hot off the heals of the fantastic PD Saga, I expected PDO to turn out at least on par with what the Saturn versions had to offer.  Instead, we get gameplay very reminscient of the early PD games, basically linear excursions through graphically impressive levels, with mind numbingly lengthy boss battles.  The desire to replay the stages just isn't there and when they constantly throw boss battles that take up to 10 minutes to complete (I'm not exaggerating here..there's a timer counting down your boss battles), PDO just gets old and stale rather quickly. Yeah, yeah...Sega threw in a host of challenges and unlockables in teh Pandora's Box including the full version of PD1, but I didn't buy an XBOX to play 8 year old Sega Saturn games I've already played to death. THe story is rather bizarre and the mini-games you play in the Pandora's Box at first seem to have no connection whatsoever to the main game (it gets clearer as you go on), but the trial and error nature of these challenges will turn off MANy gamers.  Instead of turning out to be an epic game on the XBOX..one that would be talked about for years like the Saturn games, PDO has basically become one of those games that only the hardcore players will flock to and has quickly fallen out of sight and has rarely been mentioned since. IF this is what Sega has become today, then I'll be very wary of any new releases from them in the future!	-1
Ive been waiting two years for this? This game is a joke. The graphics are nowhere near what the claims are. It was like steppin' back into the seventies and playing defender or something along those lines...Only it wasn't that fun! If you want killer graphics get Enclave...Every game should look that good. There is no excuse for grainy or childish graphics,in this day and age...It's just plain lazy.	-1
THIS GAME IS STUPID ITS SO INCREDBALY BORING I PLAYED IT FOR LIKE 5 MINUTES THAN I COULDNT STAND HOW STUPID IT WAS. ONE OF BIGGEST DISSPOINTMENTS OF THE YEAR.MAYBE RENT BUT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT BY BUYING IT.NO WONDER THIS GAME IS BAD ITS ON XBOX	-1
The game is a very slow. My 4 year old granddaughter gets really upset because the arrow moves so slowly. I guess that what you get when you buy a playstation game	-1
Game got here with the case as described but the game did not play i guess because its resurfaced but they issued my refund and i got too keep the game and the case but ima have to order the same game from a different seller hopefully it works  and plays	-1
the game diden't play at all very disapointed feel lied to about condition waste of money so unhappy with this.	-1
More sonic re releases.  I think we've played Sonic 1,2 and 3 if we wanted to by now.  Same with Sonic an Knuckles and the rest of the junky games you get on this disk.  It's not worth the money unless you see it for 2 dollars at a garage sale.	-1
The developers of this game dropped the ball like a ton of bricks.  Don't get me wrong.  The idea was cool: Four characters, each with their own technique and weapons, trying to rid the world of zombies and other possessed creatures.  But, believe me, that's where the excitement ends. From what I hear, playing this with 3 friends is where the fun lies, but if you're going alone, the only reasonable character choice is Duece.  He is the strongest and has the most reach with his axe.  You'll find that he is the ONLY one capable of handling the endless amount of enemies that appear out of nowhere, which is one of the game's biggest problems. The enemies keep respawning.  What's the point of killing tens of monsters, if they're only going to respawn seconds later?  It's repetative and pointless.  There's almost nothing worse than fighting through an area only to find that the same people you killed a moment ago keep coming back. Another HUGE problem with this game is the camera angles.  You have zero control over it.  All this game allows you is a zoom in feature, which only serves to make your experience worse.  Countless times I found myself turning a blind corner and having to actually walk a few seconds before the camera allowed me to see down that path.  That's the kind of thing that gets you needlessly killed. Next, we have the bosses.  Okay, so who's bright idea was it to make bosses so cheasy?  The first boss I fought had a horde of monsters helping him kill me, and none of them were moving slow enough for me to think too hard.  The second one, a Teddy Bear, wouldn't stop chasing me.  I had to literally run around in circles, avoiding killer spirits, while occasionally jumping to avoid Teddy Bear induced earth quakes and vomit, all the while trying to get a shot with my special weapon.  You literally only have seconds to get that one shot off.  By the way, if you run out of ammo for that special weapon, just restart, because you will not defeat that leader with anything else.  Sound like fun?  I didn't think so. The next problem is the cycling of the weapons.  During the game, I found that it takes certain weapons to destroy certain creatures.  For example, the spirits and gargoyles cannot be killed with guns and the spiders and alligators cannot be killed with blunt strikes, unless you want to die, of course.  I've tried and it resulted in either my death or a huge loss of energy.  It's a nice concept, but you'll find yourself running back and forth as you try to cycle from one weapon to another as you attempt to rid yourself of deadly spiders as the spirits are coming at you simultaneously. The final problem is the need to reload your special weapon.  Okay, I understand this concept, but then ammo is not easy to come by.  Why couldn't they just make this like Blood Rayne and give you the chance to reload when you kill someone who has a gun?  Also, why does the chainsaw have such a short limit?  It's not like it does any more damage than your regular weapon. So basically, the game sucks. One more thing.  The guy that does the voice for the mysterious dark creature that tells you why this happened sounds like the Mayor of Grant City in Dead to Rights.  They sound exactly the same, in fact, only this character is overly melodramatic.	-1
I am thoroughly confused as to how this game rates so highly. I recently saw that it was up for "Game of the Decade" at one of my favorite gaming websites, and was utterly flabbergasted.  ---Story--- ~2/5 Stars For a GBA game, it's a fine story.  For a Metroid game, it's awful.  There is no sense of isolation, a key factor of the franchise.  Samus is following non-sensical orders from a computer, with zero effort to justify them.  The entire game, the player is told to slowly traverse seven various areas of a large space station, each time allowing your enemies to further infiltrate the station.  And, why?  FOR NO REASON.  A quick boil-down of the premise:  (1)There are parasites on board; they are incredibly dangerous and cannot safely be interacted with.  (2)Go run around with them, reacting to their presence on the ship and helping them spread.  (3)Uh-oh.  Things aren't going well?  Why, how did that happen!?!?!  The only reason this story gets a second star out of five is that were one to take the Metroid logo off of it, slap new names on the characters and pretend it's a new franchise, it would be slightly less intolerable.  ---Gameplay--- ~1/5 Stars The worst comment for a Metroid-style game: It is unbelievably linear.  The player has zero option as to how to proceed.  Doors are locked or unlocked for you, and you cannot get around them until the very end of the game.  What's worse, you are forced to hold poorly-written, one-way conversations with the computer character between every action.  Enter a new area: Talk to the PC.  Find a power-up: Talk to the PC.  See a boss off in the distance: Talk to the PC.  I found this absolutely inexcusable.  Samus is simultaneously over-powered for some enemies and wholely defenseless against others.  The vast majority of enemies, and most bosses, take two shots to kill and don't cause any damage when they hit you.  Several other bosses and a hand-full of general enemies can kill Samus with three or so hits, and require all your missiles to kill.  There seems to be no logic as to enemies' difficulties, and you will often find yourself frustrated by situations where you can only succeed if very lucky.  There are so many power-ups as to make it completely unfulfilling to collect them.  Furthermore, while most are lying in plain view and the player walks into them as a matter of course, others are so meticulously hidden and require pain-staking, repeated effort to collect as to be intolerably frustrating and not worth the effort.  The casual gamer will be bored, and the completionist will be frustrated.  It's just awful.  ---Replay--- ~1/5 Stars If you can actually bring yourself to pick this game up a second time, you'll find both the linear-ness and the forced conversations with the computer character even more mind-numbing.  There are few things worse than a forced cut-scene, which you cannot skip, slowly explaining something you already know.  There is simply no point in replaying this game.  ---Overall--- ~1/5 Stars It's just a bad game.  And it's absolutely awful for a Metroid Game.  I greatly regret this purchase, and, for the life of me, cannot understand how it gets such good reviews.	-1
Metroid Fusion is a classic 2D side scroller adventure. You walk around a maze and jump up and down to complete each objective, on the way blasting away aliens/mutants/ugly videogame characters. I appreciate its ease of controls vs. Castlevania, the latter requiring you to press all the buttons at the same time.  The graphics is also among the best I've seen, and finally visible on the sidelit screen of the SP. But games like this are pretty boring after a few minutes, and if you are good you can beat it in a couple hours, with little replay value.  Try renting first.	-1
If you have an action replay, you can play the story through quickly. Otherwise, you will have to spend forever leveling up and trying to get cyframe parts and upgrade kits. The battles become tedious very quickly, as do the dungeons. The worst part, however, is that you can continue with a "new game plus" option, but you lose all of your stuff and all of the levels you gained. So, you'll have to go through the entire process again and again without gaining anything for your troubles. I can see why Amazon will only buy the game back for $1.00...	-1
Well folks, lets lay the facts out on the table.  Evolution Worlds seemed promising from the start.  The characters were pleasant to look at, and they each had a unique and interesting personality.  The plot seemed intriguing enough, and I was happy to go explore Mag Launcher (the main character)'s house and Pannam Town.  Everything went well until I actually had to go to a dungeon to do some adventuring.  GAAAAACK!  It was very monotonous and annoying!  Each floor of the ruins looked the same and all the baddies on each level were (yes you guessed it) the SAME.  Believe me, whoever created the floor plan of that place had NO imagination at ALL!!! After I completed my assignment there was another extensive cut scene which once again drew me into the plot.  I thought "Maybe it isn't as bad as I think.  Probably the next dungeon will be totally different".  WRONGO!  The next place was even worse than the last (considering there were 19 more generic floors to visit than the last place).  I'd say to you "Don't waste your time on this game.  If you want a good RPG to snuggle up with on a cold winter's night, you won't find it here!".  However, if you must, go out and rent the game (you'll regret it very quickly).  But... Heaven Forbid... DON'T BUY THE GAME... you'll soon find yourself crying next to your gamecube yelling "why.. WHY??!!!!", and I'm sure none of you feel like having a mental breakdown this early in life.  Trust me.	-1
When this game came out, I was a little wary...not sure if i wanted to be disappointed, but unable to NOT rent it. Sigh. Difficulty confirmed. Even when you get the hang of things, you never really do. Everytime you think you have it, the next scene has MORE and bigger, badder enemies. That would be fine if there had been some training in the beginning, something to tell you how to fight combo, sneak successfully. It's pretty straight forward; you follow a path, climbing and burning your way to your goal. Which of course you can't see very far ahead. That's everything wrong without the stiff, mechanical gameplay, nothing new story, and speedchanges.  Really if you must try this as a fan, rent it. By the time it's due back, you'll be plenty frusterated. It's games like this that make GOOD "games like this" never get made. I guess we'll never get Veronica Mars the game?  I recommend the BUFFY game instead! -major Buffy fan	-1
This one I don't get.  The developers of this game took the time to license the actual theme song of the sorely missed TV series, got the actual actors Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly to do the voices for the characters, which lends a great degree of authenticity...and managed to come up with a horrible, horrible game.  There's nothing wrong with the look of the game, and the Dark Angel franchise fits the popular genre of stealth/espionage games quite well.  But I noticed one thing amiss right off the bat:  Where's the tutorial level?  Every game I've ever played which involves stealth, like Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter and Splinter Cell:  Pandora Tomorrow, gives you a tutorial mission because in a stealth game, not only do you have to know the controls, you have to get familiarized with them within a gradual learning curve so that movement of your character becomes second nature; in a stealth game, no good player ever "remembers" the moves -- he feels them.  But Dark Angel has chosen to forego this step, and the result is that the controls, already not hugely responsive, are all but alien to me.  I figured out some things on my own -- the manual is scanty and poorly written -- but nothing can replace the all-important tutorial.  There's also no radar, a must in a game of this type, and looking around is laborious and risky.  Most of the time the camera prevents you from seeing what you need to see to sneak through the missions effectively.  No maps, either -- and added to the fiddly mission layouts, I spent so much time running around missions trying to find things that the gameplay just slowed to a crawl.  To slow things down even more, the loading times on this game are incredible.  Even the "Replay Stage" command, when you're trying to stop your current mission and start from the top, takes about a minute to load.  Awful.  I don't like the proportions of this game -- too much environment and not enough of the character.  It makes moving around seem more sluggish than it should be, and when you're fighting, it really spoils much of the fun factor.  I'd rather have had a character-screen proportion closer to Syphon Filter or Jet Li's Rise to Honor.  And whoever came up with the idea of using a Matrix-style "bullet time" while you fight obviously doesn't know how to design fighting games, because it makes fighting a bore.  You can't control when the slow-motion occurs, so you end up having to wait before you can execute the next move.  This feature basically takes your in-game control of your character away from you randomly -- something that should *never* happen in an action game.  I am tremendously disappointed, because the TV series, the wonderful character of Max, the setting...everything was just perfect for a video-game translation.  And they had taken the effort to get Alba and Weatherly, put James Cameron's name on the box, and get so many of the stylistic touches right (good one-liners in the dialogue) that it's a shame that the game is mechanically unplayable.  Seems like they spent all their money and time on aesthetics and forgot to test out the mechanics...no wonder this game is now widely available second-hand for less than six dollars, less than a year after I first saw it available.  I will probably sell mine soon.	-1
Pros: - Fancy Matrix-style moves. - The game is severely discounted. - Voice talent is from the TV series. - Frequent save games. - Simple controls to pull off a variety of moves. Cons: - Very very repetitive. - Uninteresting storyline between sequences. - Pulling off the fancy moves doesn't really get you much new. - AI is poor. Far too easy to stealtily take down the enemy. - Game world is far too constraining. There is far too little to do. - When fighting the boss you lose the ability to use your weapons and health packs.	-1
worst game i have everplayed, wasteoftime and of money.	-1
I'm pretty open to most games... in fact, I don't find too many shooters that I don't enjoy, and to top that off, I really enjoy more "realistic" games. Unfortunately, Ghost Recon fails in nearly all environments excluding online play. You see, in single player, you run around, mostly in forest type terrain (you can't actually SEE any enemies because there are too many trees and the graphics are so poor that you can't barely distinguish a bush and an enemy). Now here is the HUGE problem, you have 5 other teammates all controlled by AI (unless you switch to them specifically)... they 3 of them run through the level on a predetermined path and easily kill all their enemies without stopping.  The 2 guys that run with you, are gauranteed to see the enemy and kill the enemy before you ever even realize they are there (remember you can't see anything). This game has a superb concept, but just completely lacks in its actually gameplay, its annoying and boring. If you are an intense online player, this game will provide tons of action packed fun on xbox live... but by all means, avoid it for the single player missions. If you are looking for realistic-semi-realistic shooters, try out conflict desert storm I and II.... both very fun squad play in first person.. stealth, action, great weapons, great squad dynamics, etc.	-1
i thought this game would be good but i was very dissapointed when i played it cons:terrible graphics,enveriments need worked on,cant see your gun,cant tell if enemy or on your side pros:coop mode,you can pick what type of soilders you want with you	-1
If your looking for a good simulation of a military force moving around under your control and killing bad men, then do yourself a favor and buy Socom Navy Seals.  There is nothing this game has that Socom doesn't (nothing you'd want anyway) In ghost recon your always in 1st person.  That's fine, but show me a gun and a couple of hands at least!  When you shoot, bullets come out of nowhere and move in the direction of your target.  Absolutely no sense that your the one firing a weapon. To boot, the gunshots sound horrible.  Again if you've played Navy Seals or Medal of Honor you WILL be disappointed. The whole thing of being able to jump from one man to another is only confusing at best and lends nothing to being able to control the group. While Navy Seals had some flaws like the fact that your other team members are completly incapable of throwing grenades(in single player mode anyway) and you sometimes have to repeat commands twice or even 3 or 4 times, it is still a far superior game in every sense. I would give Navy Seals 4.5 stars. Ghost recon barely gets away with 2	-1
Please don't buy this game my husband played it twice and both times in different areas the game just locked up. We tried getting another disc and it did the same thing halfway through and in different missions the game once more locked up.  Rent it only that way you are saved from the locking up.  I believe that UBI Soft put alot of bad discs on the market and yet we haven't found one that didn't lock up.  RENT DON'T BUY!!!	-1
This game is quite well done, but I did not enjoy playing it because it is so slow-paced. Gameplay: In the game's campaign mode, you have two teams with 3 members in each. There are 15 missions you have to complete, and three different difficulty settings. There is nightvision, and lots of different weapons. The problem I found with this game, is it is way too slow. You spend a lot of time just running around, and not actually shooting anyone, which I find boring. I have not played it on LIVE, but that may make it better. Graphics: THe graphics were a huge dissapointment, especially on the XBOX which is supposed to have superior graphics to the other systems. Sound:THe sound is quite excellent, but sound alone is not something to buy a game on. Replay Value: I think this game might have pretty good replay value, but I can't say  because I haven't had it that long. The capability of playing it on XBOX LIVE will definently add to this replay value, but doing the same missions again and again could get boring. Overall: I was disappointed with this game, but that is probably because I'm not a fan of slower games. If you are someone that really likes something very realistic to the military and don't care that there isn't much shooting involved, this game is probably for you. If you don't like slow games, or games with little action, I wouldn't reccomend it, but you can always rent it to try it out. I hope this helped you out.	-1
joystick broke	-1
Controller joystick stopped working literally after 3 days of opening the package	-1
The cord broke from the top of the controller in the first week of game play.	-1
BEWARE of this controler!! The wire on the top started separating and became exposed from the controler within 2 weeks after purchase. I tried to duck tape it, but had no luck it still kept falling apart. The rubber on the C stick and thumbstick also feel off not to long after that. Go spend the extra money for a real gamecube controler it's worth it in the end.	-1
This is a decent controller, but with problems. The feel is alright, somewhat cheaper plastic than the original controllers, but that is expected for the price. It works fine with GameCube and Wii, and I've been able to play my games with minimal issue. The biggest con for me is the fact that on the controller I received, the left trigger does not register a full press. It will register when you hold down the trigger halfway down, but does not register when you press it all the way down. While this hasn't affected the game that I bought it for (Star Fox Adventures), I can definitely see this as a problem if I wanted to play something like LoZ: Twilight Princess.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this controller. If you have the money to spend on a slightly better one, do so. If not, you can take the risk and get this one. It's a decent controller, as I mentioned, but the production is half-assed and you might end up with a defective unit like mine.	-1
Broke the minute I plugged it in. Didn't stop vibrating, nothing worked. Opened it up and couldn't find anything out of place. Just poor design not worth the money. Have to actually buy a Nintendo brand controller.	-1
First off where to begin, this product is absoutely fake. Its NOT a gamecube controller its a fake Chinese knock off. The Z button was broken when i got it, it clearly doesn't say ANYTHING about being a knock off, like it should and it doesn't even at least say its a 3rd party. They (and by they i mean the sick company that made them) are smart enough to never say Nintendo on the packaging or even the controllers themselves. They work (like crap anyway) but they have a lot of flaws. DO NOT BUY THIS! >:(	-1
Well all the hype on the demo disks made me go out and buy this Xbox live.  It looks like a pretty good product, but when I went to set it up, nope, couldn't connect.  When I visited the Xbox Live website, I was informed that it will not work with AOL Broadband.  I thought since I could use my playstation network adapter that AOL had also allowed Xbox Live.  Guess I assumed incorrectly.  The headset is a little tricky to put together, but everything seems nice.  Playing the demos included with the Xbox Live disk are fun, but they are only demos.  I do wish that for the cost of this, you would have gotten a full version game with it. Unfortunately, I'll be taking this back or selling it, since my pleas to AOL to allow Xbox Live are answered with "We're aware of this situation and are working on solutions to allow this"	-1
sure, xbox live is very nice, With all the acessibilty and freedom the product gives you, but lets go into how much it used to be, This item was 50$, yes it still is, but before you woild have a free game with the package, along with the headset and cd, now you get a demo instead of the game, A DEMO, the game made the price,to prove that, lets add things up. You woul;d get a headset (Lets price that around,say 11$) adn a geame, (lets make that 39$) and the live cd, wich shouldnt cost anything because thats the service, but microsoft didn't want to lose to much money so they changed ity too a mere demo, and I close this by saying, don't write a letter to microsft if you are anoyed by this, they will only send you a recording.	-1
Slick exspensive joystick. By the way you have to make sure the scencor reads the joystick for it to work. anyways I had the battery's go out on me in the middle of a flight. so my tip to you is either have back up key board keys for flying or get a new joystick.  Good pc games:halflife    C-strike    Battle field 1942 (the ultimate war game)    You can drive tanks boats, jeeps, motorcycles, planes carriers etc. helocopters too.	-1
The first thing you will notice about the game is how ridiculously disproportionate the characters look. Wow, in a world of Dead or Alive Extreme Volley Ball, couldn't UBI Soft do better that this? Okay, but you get to beat up on Apollo Creed and all the other antagonists from the Rocky movies, so maybe there is something here. Not so. I was bored in minutes. With so many excellent fighting games out, how can one endure repeating a few simple moves? (Punch, punch, jab . . . jab, punch, punch.) It's pretty bad. And when you get hit hard, little blue start appear above your head. Once I got hit with a jab the stomach, and the character flipped up and around, and landed facing down on the mat. It was more like a move in professional wrestling. But hey, if you really want a boxing game, you might like it.	-1

And when you get hit hard, little blue start appear above your head. Once I got hit with a jab the stomach, and the character flipped up and around, and landed facing down on the mat. It was more like a move in professional wrestling. But hey, if you really want a boxing game, you might like it.	-1
The images are bad, the way to fight too.  This is not a good game, is bored.  is better the Super Nintendo Myke Tyson Game  in 1990.  Don`t waist money.  Choose another option.	-1
I have played just about every morg out there and can say that this game has its moments. The graphics and music are excellent.  The leveling system is novel, you do not lvl like most morgs.  Instead you train up skills over time, even while your offline.  Some skills take only hours (real time not game time) to lvl up and others take days and weeks.  Only one skill can be trained at a time. I am not sure what the end game is though, I'm not sure they know what it is.  For the player that likes to mine and manufacture this is the game for you.  The travel can be tedious and finding good hunting spots can be difficult. Death can be rather expensive.  You can lose very expensive ships very fast.  In addition to the monetary loss you lose skills even if you have a clone set up.  Without a clone prepared you can lose even more of your skills. Most games that launch these days seem to have their share of bugs and this game isn't any different.  I am not as concerned about the bugs being fixed as I am about the ultimate end game.  What is it??	-1
I bought a Nyko Worm Cam a while ago and I am really disappointed. It advertises that it takes great digital pictures but it really doesn't. It is very slow and hard to use and the color is always grainy and dull. If you try to print your pictures they always come out blurry if you print them any bigger than wallet size. It is also hard to aim your picture, it doesn't have any sort of view finder or anything like that. And if you take pictures outside and it's a cloudy day you STILL have to use that small easy to lose sun filter. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this lousy piece of [junk] and I hope you don't either...	-1
I play alot of the ATV games and this one just stunk! one thing: camera angle, BAD. I bought this games for a $1 at a store brand new, I understand why it was cheap because people kept on returnig it. so use your mouse and click on a differnt ATV game because this one is BAD!!!!	-1
First off, I know this game is great and please buy it! My review is based off of the sellers. This picture doesn't even demonstrate the horrible quality. I can tell the game had an awful attempt of disk cleaning used on it. LvlUpGaming assured this game was tested and worked fine. I tried it on two different ps2 consoles and it couldn't even load as far as the title screen!! So disappointed.... I know this game is great. But the seller is not. I recommend buying it new since LvlUpGaming lies about the quality of their games.	-1
As the title says, I do hate being a critic because I couldn't even make a game in QBasic but... This game is annoying, it will tick you off. First of all there is no "Fury" or edge to this game. The soundtrack is awful and doesn't go with the game at all. There are flaws to this game with are rediculous! First of all, if you hit a rotting wood crate going 52MHP it will not cause you to go flying 400 yards, it will break. Second of all, you get a pixel off the track and this annoying screen comes up and tells you to get back on the track in 5 seconds. It will distract you, it will tick you off. This game could be great, but it needs work and I hope version 3 corrects these problem. Please, spend you money somewhere else or at least buy this used!	-1
I expected this game to be a fitting sequel to Dark Cloud which was repetitive but fun overall but it isn't It's just repetitive. The graphics look amazing but that's the only plus. It does use the same dungeon crawler style but the enemies are downright pathetic, you're weilding a wrench as a weapon, not a sword. You pretty much die the moment you get hit. I recently put it back into my ps2 because I'd decided I never really gave it too much of a chance but it was a big mistake. It made me hate myself even more for wasting all that money and time. You'd be happier if you threw your money into an office shredder.  A giant elephant and a big fat clown with dynamite strapped to his half-naked body  (It's not the psychotic kind of clown you see  in horror movies either.) is hardly worth  fighting if at all and the story is utterly ridiculous. By the time max actually saw the outside world I expected the problem and solution to be explained but all we get is "A bad guy destroyed the world and we don't know why." They never even explain where the characters are going and why.  The races in the last game (Though underdeveloped as characters) were loads more interesting than anything I ever saw in this  poor excuse for a sequel. I played long enough to encounter the "firbits". Rip offs of the seven dwarves from snow white. (They even have you keep an eye out for a woman who appeared in their forest one day, made their lives better and mysteriously disappeared.) NOTHING about this game keeps the player interested. You don't know why Max does anything when the adventure starts Or how Monica supposedly came from the future when the first time we see her she's in a castle  fighting stupid looking monsters and the next time she's a boy  with an oversized shirt on who apparently has a knack for  transmitting telekinetic messages into Max's mind.  I got hours in and nothing makes sense. Nothing. I think they  just drew the scenes and characters from a hat and patched them together at random. You'd be better off buying a product called "Heart -attack in a can."  Don't  buy this.	-1
A lot of people are going to disagree, and that's fine. This is simply my opinion, based on 40+ hours of game play.  This game is horrible. The first few hours are awesome, and you'll think it's fun. That charm soon vanishes, and all you're left with is a boring, older, duller version of Kingdom Hearts - as far as gameplay goes anyways.  Throw in some cheap watered down version of Sim City, and there you go. Oh, and the building of towns...yeah, mind numbingly boring.  Everybody says this is like Zelda for PS2? I say they must be smokin something awesome, because this is nowhere near Zelda.  Don't buy into the hype, it's false, and you'll waste money.	-1
First off, I appluad infro games for making & great career mode. I love the different options & stats. It keeps you in the game. You really want to get that top spot. Your name in the paper is nice too.. The downfall is the gameplay. It severly lacks. The cars have no sense of speed which translates into a boring game. Going 70-80 isn't fast for a race game. How can a group so focuced on realism not add more speed is beyond me. The sounds [stink] & the crowds cheering sounds muffled. The worst part besides the lack of speed are the graphics. They look like a PS1 game. That wouldn't be so bad if the game play was tight. I agree with another reviwer about the analog controls being slow & sluggish. Buy this game used if at all. It's not worth the [money] by a long shot..	-1
this is the kind of mindless violent idiocy that people who have never played videogames think all videogames are like. how crappy is this game? let me count the ways. it is crappy in the way it's a third person shooter and weapons automatically lock on. it has crappy camera positioning. the animation is jerky, and looks like something for nintendo 64, not xbox. anderton's face is a mask of brutality. the premise is cool, the way you can throw someone through a plate glass window is cool (but the execution is nowhere near as nice as spiderman), and the heat-wave effects in the stun weapon is cool. all that adds up to is about 1 hour of basic training and gameplay and then utter disgust.	-1
Ok the graphics for the game are killer! no doubt about it top notch pretty cool.  heres the bad..... no health meters, you cant punch anybody, (only pistol whip), your charcter is arrested way too easyily.  The controls of this game really suck!  and you cant adjust them to make them the way you want them.  i really cant belive they made a game look so cool have such great feautures then make playing the actual game suck!! there are movie sequences that you cant fast forward threw and they take litterly forever!!  i wish they had kept working on this game it had so much potential but it fell flat on it's face!  This game take forever to play.  it's extremly boring.  lots of driving and stupid police chases that start for no reason.  Sorrry getaway but you no good :(	-1
One of the most eagerly awaited games came to our screens and consoles not with bang but with a burp. It seems that 'Team Soho' have decided to take a few steps back in the modern day 3D action/shoot-em-up/driver/drama by releasing something that is more than a few notches down from what they should be capable of doing.  First of all there are NO camera angles in the car other than 3rd person driver view. No rear view or side views or interior views which is a total shame since it seems like the game engine could actually handle it. Why bother creating a realistic map of London if we can't look around a bit or even SEE the police cars that are chancing us!!!... Seriously!  So okay we will forgive it maybe if something else happens like the ultra cool combo movements we have been hearing about but alas Max Payne style character animation has been thrown out the door for something that looks like it has just popped out from 'Afraid of the Dark 1'. The character does two cool movements period. These are.... breaking necks and..... acting drunk when all shot up. Okay... very cool... but I think I paid some money for a GAME here?  The cut scenes, story and character animation are NOT BAD at all but I would rather watch 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' than this. I really wanted to play 'The Getaway' and when the action starts and you begin driving you have about three minutes fun and then it all starts to get very repetitive. The car smash physics, controls and damage are great but it is still a few notches down from what you expect (don't expect any stunts or overturning in The Getaway either) because it is simply a bit boring. A few ramps here and there would have made all the difference.  Okay so we drive and then we reach the place where we are supposed to do some shooting with sort of 'around the corner' style shots and taking hostages as bullet shields before capping them because they have served their purpose. Cool!!! for awhile and then you find that the actual control of the character is like a 50/50 bet. Sometimes it works and aims and you can shoot and sometimes the enemy is running through a wall or you seem to have targeted him even though he is standing behind a wall and then someone you where aiming at vanishes into a wall and then you say to hell with this someone get The Getaway into product testing fast!!! AND THIS IS THE MORAL OF THE STORY.  Team Soho have clearly put themselves under pressure to release a game for that Christmas period. Well that is fine with me and if product stability is put second to XMAS sales figures then fine... but to be quite frank I feel that I will use caution with Team Soho releases. All it would have taken is a little more testing, a few fixes here and there and then we would have something to boast about!  Driv3r and Vice City had bugs but where playable... this one is totally not.	-1
Game developers are constantly trying to make games more and more "realistic."  Now we have action games that are more like watching movies - cheesy B-movies - but they're just not fun, and they slow the pace of the games to a crawl.  This insatiable quest for realism is even bleeding over into simple games like "Wheel of Fortune," where your game is interrupted every other second by computer contestants spouting stupid platitudes, or by Vanna White appearing to grin at you and show off her necklace, which looks like a belt buckle on a chain.  And what the heck is Vanna White doing *hosting* the show?  Where is Pat Sajak?  Vanna sounds like she's reading from a book titled, "Things Pat Sajak Might Say," and her inflection gives us a clue as to why her acting career didn't take off.  The game play is tried and true, but it does seem like you spin more bankrupts and lose-a-turns than the computer players do.  I was also infuriated by the way the computer players constantly buy vowels as soon as they have the money -- just like the real show!  Thankfully you can play with one or two players and no computer contestants... a *very* smart move from Atari.  The graphics are fine, nothing too flashy.  I like how the camera is constantly zooming in and pulling back on the wheel or the board.  The sound is adequate and, as previously noted, annoying.  Some of the other options included are useless.  I tried to take the "contestant exam," and after a 30-second load time, I was presented with a puzzle.  I solved it and was told I had gotten 1 of 16 correct; then I had to wait through another 30-second load time before puzzle No. 2 came up.  Intolerable!  I also noticed no differences between the "quick play" and the "normal game," except the fact that my name was "Player 1" instead of "Dennis."  Overall, if you're a "Wheel" fan, you'll like this version.  Believe it or not, I had a version of this game in the 1980s on a floppy disc that played better than this one -- but as I've said before, simpler most of the time is better.	-1
I bought this game at Target along with my X-Box unit. I played approximately an hour and a half of thie game. I don't recommend the game for beginning video players and for those who like good graphics. First, in the second section of the Ceylon portion of the game, the Indy character enters a pool of water. He is expected to find his way into the ruined temple. I spent considerable time attempting to get the character to move past this point without success. I believe a more experienced gamer may have better luck. I know the reviewers at GameSpot could pass this point. (They rated the game a 6.6.) Second, the graphics are bad. I have seen instances of Indy's arm, leg, or torso enter a wall or a plant. Tomorrow, I am exchanging my game for a better game.	-1
Vanna talks way too much, most of it useless commentary, even AI player voices are rediculous. Loads very slow between rounds. Many of the small failures of this game will make you not want to play it. They took a relativly simple game and made it slow-paced and annoying. I don't see how so many people gave this game a high rating. Clearly they don't know anything about video games! Just like the people who creating this one...	-1
I should have really given this game one star, but as my tag line reads the cut scenes are top notch.  Well acted, well written, and a fantastic view of the world the game is trying to illustrate, these cut scenes are some of the best I have ever seen.  However if you buy a game for the actually game playing, avoid this one like the plague!  The character animation is really poor, it is too slow, the player has no control over the tempo of their character, and the on screen information is nonexistent. I read the PS2 Magazine write up of the game and the designers were talking about how they thought that this game both provided insights into the world of crime found no where else, and brought a level of maturity to gaming that has not been seen before.  In my opinion, and the opinion of PS2 Magazine, these were slights against the Grand Theft Auto series, and in this case they were slights that do not reflect reality.  This game may, and let me emphasize may, be better than Grand Theft when it comes to cut scenes, but when one looks at the rest of the game the Getaway is a sad pretender to what its designers hoped it would be.  If you are looking for a game to buy go out and buy GTA 3 or Vice City, do not buy the Getaway, you will be very disappointed.	-1
Look, if you're looking for a game that's fun to play, this isn't it! I waited like the rest of you for it to come out. I've played it for countless miserable hours, screaming and yelling at it because the controls are absolutely terrible and there are no saves! So, you play nearly to the end of a level and die, Bingo! You have to start all over again!!!  You don't agree with me? Fine. Wait till you get to the last two levels and you'll be singing a different tune... It's not too bad in the beginning, but it gets progressively harder and with no saves and no health, you're destined to play the level over and over and over and over and over and over again... Don't waste your money on it! Play a game that's better designed and fun to play!	-1
PROS: 1.  GOOD FIGHT ANIMATIONS-really captures Indy's wild, drunken fighting style.  I also loved how Indy's hat would fall off after  he would get punched many times. 2.  GOOD CHOICE OF WEAPONS-a nice touch is the ability to use weapons dropped from your enemies. 3.  MUSIC-John Williams' classic score is integrated well during key points of action. CONS: 1.  MEDIOCRE GRAPHICS-the textures are muddy.  So much so that I had to increase the sharpness level of my TV just to make sure it wasn't causing the problem.  Again, XBox owners get leftovers from a PS2 ported game. 2.  HORRID FRAME RATE-the game stutters all over the place when there are more than two enemies on the screen at once. 3.  HORRID COLLISION DETECTION-Indy and enemies will magically teleport through walls and floors 4.  BLOCKY PLAYER MOVEMENT-despite the good fighting animations, Indy's movements tend to skip a few frames. 5.  UNINSPIRED CUT SCENES USING IN-GAME GRAPHICS-the cut scenes would have been negligible had the graphics engine been more than decent.  Whatever happened to CGI, movie-quality cut scenes? 6.  RIGID VOICE ACTING-the actor playing Indy sounds exactly like Harrison Ford's tired drawl.  However, he also sounds like he's reading the script rather than acting it out.  The same goes for the other voice actors. 7.  REPETITIOUS LEVEL DESIGN-there's too much emphasis on jumping from ledge to ledge and swimming. 8.  BUGS, BUGS, BUGS, I HATE BUGS!-the game tends to freeze every once in awhile which is inexcusable.  Lucasarts' quality assurance department should be fired. *1/2 OUT OF ****	-1
I will list the reasons why this game doesn't add up.  First and foremost, controlling the character (Hammond) is almost impossible.  He runs slower than my grandmother, and as he loses health, he runs even slower.  He cannot run up or down stairs-- he tends to prance up them-- not kidding.  The characters use the F word in every cutscene, which is just stupid.  When your player gets in a car, he cannot drive more than 40 mph for some reason, regardless of the type of automobile.  You cannot shoot weapons out of cars while you drive, yet other gang members can shoot at you from their cars.  In out-of-vehicle gun battles (on foot) auto aim is sluggish and often unreliable.  When you get shot, you have to limp to a wall and lean there for 60 seconds to regain health, which gets annoying when gang members are shooting at you.  controls are HORRIBLE, and the weapons selection is very limited (shotguns, MP-5's and AK-47s are the most powerful weapons. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:  The Getaway has incredible graphics and takes place in a virtual London (downtown area) that is almost a replica of the British city.  Real brand names exist-- you can see popular fast-food places and clothing stores, which adds a lot of realism.  All the major London landmarks are in the game, Buckingham Palace, Trefalgar Square, Big Ben/Parliament, Tower of London/museum, London Eye, etc.. The traffic AI is very impressive, and there are many more cars on the streets than in the popular GTA3 games. Summary: Graphics and cityscape are very realistic, but the sluggish play control makes the game very annoying.	-1
Okay, MAYBE my view would have been different had I not played Vice City beforehand, but I have and so the Getaway gets a poor review.  The cutscenes are top-notch, almost Hollywood quality, and I hate to say this, but having the f-word just makes the game cooler.  The pros stop there though! Gamepley is awful.  The main character moves slowly and awkwardly.  Cars handle realistically, but that doesn't mean they handle in a playable manner.  I do like how the cars run poorer and poorer as they get more and more damaged, but the damage itself is unrealistic.  The camera is awful, never in the right place.  Controls are bad as well, sure you have autoaim, but you basically just have to hold down R1 until everything is dead, because there is no telling what it is you are shooting at.  I could go on and on, but the fact is that I don't care enough about this game to put it down, I just want to warn you gamers out there.  I'm going back to Vice City!	-1
First off, this game features the most downright ugly hero you'll ever see. The controls are sluggish and annoying. 'Ammond runs like a Thunderbirds puppet and it becomes a feat in itself to simply move about. Can't run and shoot. Very innovative. When you stand still, the baddies shoot you. Go figure. In this realistic game, our gormless hero can't open doors, jump over foot-high blockades (or jump at all) and recovers from shotgun blasts to the face by leaning against walls. The game isn't 'fun' in the same way GTA is- the car chase bits are deathly dull, due to the fact that you'll crash into a car or pole every ten seconds. The cops can't pull you out of your car either, so it's more of an endurance test than a challenge, just keep ploughing along. The regular cars barely move at all, only the Lexuses and sportscars are worth jacking. No camera angles in the car sections, so mission briefs like "Bring the triads to our HQ, and make sure that they follow you" are nonsensical as you cant look behind you. No onscreen maps or info either. Or ammo counts for that matter. Everything is so big on the screen- compare the feeling of space that you have around you in GTA with this. In GTA, traffic and baddies can be seen approaching, whereas in this they appear right on you. Again, the 'lean-against-a-wall-to-gain-energy' system. Even the non playable characters comment that you're standing around like an idiot. Sorry love, can't help it. Glitchy graphics. A friend of mine encountered a horde of giants in Hyde Park who shrunk to midgets once neared. Is perspective reversal common in the UK? Negotiating stairwells cause 'Ammond to perform a very camp jig. Can't the man just bound up them with dignity? And so on and so on...	-1
The camera angles in this game absolutely stink. They remain fixed and do not follow you around as you move through the game. This method of gameplay worked pretty well in the hit series Resident Evil, but plays out very poorly in this game. It's difficult to maintain fighting sequences with bad guys and to see exactly what you're doing. The fighting sequences are very frustrating and the punch and kick combos look terrible (Batman kicks low, to the shins! now that's low for the dark knight). The tools also stink. The batarangs and smoke bombs are awkward to use, and pretty much unusuable during combat. I do have to give this game some props for the music track and style - both of which are very good. But the gameplay is awkward. This game is difficult, and not in a good way. Huge batman fans, prepare to be disappointed.	-1
Is it possible to produce a good game based Batman?  I can't remember ever playing a good one, going all the way back to the old "Batman Returns" on the Sega Genesis.  And this game is even worse than that.  It features the worst camera angles I've ever seen on a game (while moving, the camera suddenly shifts, and you find yourself going in some other unintended direction).  The graphics are sub-par.  The only good thing about this game is the cutscenes - they're first class.  But apparently, the budget for the game was spent on this feature alone, because the gameplay and graphics are awful. This should give you an idea of how bad it is.  I bought it yesterday, and attempted to trade it in today.  The guy at EB was so ashamed of how bad the game was, he refunded me the full price.	-1
Batman: Dark Tomorrow is a study in poorly conceived, aggravating gameplay and marks yet another failed caper for the caped crusader. Even die-hard fans will want to tie the disc to a Batarang and hurl it out the window. Just hope it doesn't come back.	-1
It's not every day that I advocate video games becoming more derivative, but in the case of "Jeopardy!", I'll make an exception.  I've played a lot of video-game versions of "Jeopardy!", which has gotten easier to adapt as video game technology has improved.  In the early 90's, the Sega Genesis version was a nightmare to play, as you had to spell out answers in their entirety with just a D-pad and three easily-confused buttons (for "select letter", "delete letter", and "accept").  Games took well over an hour to play and punished players who accidentally submitted incomplete responses by pushing the wrong button.  Worse, there was no way for the cartridge to remember which questions had already been used, so you always risked getting repeat questions, which killed the fun and novelty of the game.  The CD-i version (of all things!) in 1995 was a breakthrough by substantially solving these problems.  First, it had a list of "completions", so after entering a few letters of your response, you could see it matching an alphabetical list of possible answers, and just arrow over and pick the completion.  This dramatically sped up game play.  The other fix was that the game could use the small (8KB?) built-in memory of the CD-i player to log which questions had already been used, effectively eliminating repeat questions.  With the copious CD storage, it was also possible to read the questions aloud -- while not necessary, it was a nice touch.  The only flaw was that the controller 1 had a clear and obvious advantage over controller 2 when ringing in.  The PlayStation "Jeopardy!"s polished the "completion" system of the CD-i version, and saved the question usage stats to the memory card.  In other words, it didn't fix what wasn't broken... it just took "Jeopardy done right" to a wide audience than would have seen the CD-i version.  And now, the PlayStation 2 version arrives with this history of "Jeopardy!" video game evolution behind it... and promptly proceeds to ignore it.  While it uses a sensible completion system for entering answers, it makes the stunningly boneheaded move of NOT saving stats about question usage to the memory card, allowing repeat questions to appear at potentially any time (at least the Genesis version allowed you to reject categories you knew you'd already seen - Atari's PS2 version isn't even that smart).  What the heck were the Atari engineers and producers thinking?  Apparently, they were too focused on features nobody really needs, like having CPU contestants answer with actual audio replies instead of on-screen text (memo to Atari: nobody cares).  Increasingly powerful systems should allow "Jeopardy!" to become more like the actual game show with each generation -- eventually, the game should be able to use a microphone and speech recognition technology to let players speak their answers aloud.  But more important than the technology is a basic competence and awareness of gameplay issues, of fun, that this game screws up with the single avoidable mistake of not logging question usage to avoid repeat questions.	-1
We've had enough of these kind of games already.  Buy Def Jam Vendetta instead.	-1
I ordered Activision Anthology for PS2.  I received Atari Anthology for XBox.  When I opened up the XBox game case there was a music CD inside.  Basically I was robbed or these people are completely incompetent.	-1
I grew up playing games in arcades, and at home on my Atari 5200.  I thought buying this game would bring me back to the fun I had as a kid.  It didn't.  The game itself is fine, however with the upgraded technologies (graphics, sounds, controls) of todays games, these just don't seem fun anymore.	-1
The game itself isn't bad.. But the fact that this was a boot leg is the problem.. It takes over a minute just to get to the starting screen cause they have some garbage atnthe start that you can't skip.. Then the worst part, it took over 2 months to get here.. Want more? The game resets your saves so it's nearly impossible to beat unless you play nonstop..	-1
I'm sure it's a great game, except the fact that I never received it!	-1
What were they thinking, porting one of the Greatest NES games of all-time Kirby's Adventure to the GBA!!! The music is wrong, the sounds are wrong, The gameplay is wrong, and the difficulty is easier! It coundn't have gotten worse than this. If your gonna make a port atleast leave the game as it was and try to get the name right or it will ruin the game for everyone!!! They shoud have came out with a totally new Kirby game for the GBA and brought this one to the GC in mayby something like a Kirby Collectors addition with games such as: Kirby's Dreamland 1,2,and 3, Kirby's Adventure,Kirby Super Star, Kirb:The crystal Shards, and more!!! Now that is a great idea!	-1
I knew this game wasn't worth table scraps and I was right. The game is way too short! The bosses are too easy, and the ability to have combination copies is nowhere to be found. The only credit I could give this game is the nice graphics. Evrything in it doesnt even come close 2 Kirby: Crystal Shards. I'd recommend Kirby: NiD for kids 7 and under....	-1
I 'm sorry, but this game was one of the worst games I have ever played.  You just start the game by going through levels using the powers, but your not as aggressive like in Kirbys Super Star, now that was a game!  Every time you get hit, you lose your power!  It is mad annoying.  The story of the game isn't explained until you beat it which doesn't take long at all if your good at adventure games.  This was a poor excuse for a Kirby game.  There was no story and Kirby's powers weren't the same and cool as Kirbys Super Star.  So I don't reccomend this game, I had to find out the hard way how bad it is.	-1
LOOK.....DID MICRO NOT LEARN ANYTHING FROM FROM THE FAILURE OF THOSE RIDICULOUS [EXPENSIVE] XBOX BUNDLES TRYING TO MAKE YOU BUY ABOUT FIVE GAMES WITH THE SYSTEM? COME ON.....I LIKE THE XBOX BUT I AM NOT GOING TO SPEND [A LOT] ON A CONTROLLER THAT LOOKS LIKE IT CAN A WHEEL BLOCK FOR A BULL DOZER. ITS ALSO A LOT BIGGER THAN THE XBOX TOO TAKING UP SO MUCH SPACE THAT I ALMOST HAVE TO GET A TABLE TO MAKE IT GET USED CORRECTLY. "IF THE XBOX IS SO POWERFUL WHY DON'T THEY MAKE A CONTROLLER THAT IS LESS EXPENSIVE LIKE SAY THE FORCE FEED BACK CONTROLLERS?????" I LIKE MECH GAMES BUT MICRO HAS TURNED ME OFF FROM THIS ONE. I'LL SAVE MY MONEY FOR "MECH ASSAULT".	-1
In the begining I was having a blast! I loved the game. Then it got boring. The load time was making me impatiant and I coudn't figure out how to do a couple of things. After playing this game for hours everyday this game ended up on the bottom of my stack of games. If you want to play this game I would suggest renting it first and if you are that into it than maybe buying it, but I wouldn't waste my money.	-1
I bought this brand new and after about 1 weeks the up on the directional pad started giving trouble. I love the pad for my N64 but I didn't like the poor quality.	-1
I returned the Saitek P3000 Wireless Gamepad because the batteries not working, and random glitches due to the wireless connection during game play. It was consistently a problem.  I decided, to keep with Saitek, but to buy this controller, so i could keep my profiles, and i wouldn't have to send a weekend programming it.  Right out of the box, i discovered the shift button did not work. So now i have to send this one back for a return.  Another weird thing is, when i loaded my profiles with this controller, they were blank. When i open the file, the data is still there. Instead of reprogramming it, i have decided to get the Logitech. I use their game-pads for my XBOX and have never had a problem.  I am convinced the Saitek just makes mediocre sub standard products. Its a name i will stay away from in the future.  Conclusion: I just bought the , Logitech Wingman Wireless Rumble Pad its by far a better gamepad. Its 2.4GHZ, so it has distance. The software to program custom scripts is miles ahead of the Saitek SST software. When you load the profile, it automatically loads the game which it corresponds with.  Please, if your looking for a game pad, get the Logitech. Save your self the 3 weeks on pain I had to go through.	-1
This game looks weird without Mario. Besides your doing what wario allways does. Stealing treasure. I bet this will be hard.	-1
My 7 year old is mario crazy and wanted this game, worked fine, just not sure it really compared with some of the newer Mario games and he lost interest quick	-1
i purchased this game because i am a fan of the Wario World games and sadly this is the only one that i will never play again.	-1
This game is one of the shortest games I've played - for those of you who like to play a long game with a lot of worlds - this game is not for you at all. But for those of you who like a really short game - hunting for treasure chests - and some comedy that rolls through out the game - then this is probably for you.	-1
But perfect for the inexperienced gamer, or a little brother or sister. There are puzzles and bosses that are super easy. I rented it, but i wouldn't buy it. Rent it and see for yourself...not too challenging.	-1
I do not like this game because its hard depressing and not fun. As wario you look for lost treasure beat bad guys so on. Bosses super hard THIS GAME IS FRUSTRATING!	-1
Watio World is effectively a throwback to the 16-bit era of 2D side scrolling platfomers. Unfortunately, it is not a patch on any of them. The emphasis is on tedious button bashing. Instead of quickly dispatching your enemies as Sonic might do with a quick bounce on the head, gland-challenged Wario has to knock seven bells out of them first, which makes the pace slow. With the much better Viewtiful Joe out on the shelves, Wario World is the worse platform beat-em-up by far. Strangely, its' fans seem to really like it. I can only think that they haven't played Streets of Rage or indeed any 2D platformer of the Megadrive/SNES era.	-1
Unfortunately, I can not share the enthusiasm of my fellow reviewers. The game has a lot of good sides. The graphics are beautiful. Asides from the character interaction with the plants (brushing up to plants or pushing them out of the way), this game features some of the best plant, jungle, and mountain settings I've ever seen in a game. Mission design is also OK, although not great. THIS GAME HAS ONE BIG PROBLEM THOUGH: Gameplay! I do not consider myself the world's best FPS player, but I also ain't the worst. Normally, I play FPS games on the hardest possible setting. This one, I played on "hard", which is the second hardest setting. And still, I was so frustrated by this game that I decided not to finish it half way through (which is a first for me). I mean, don't get me wrong: I like that there finally is an FPS game where it is not unrealistically easy for the player to kill the enemy and where the enemy doesn't have an unrealistically hard time to kill the player. But in this game, things are outrageous! It is almost impossible to kill with one shot, while the enemy seems to be able to do that all the time! To give you an idea of what I am talking about: I am in a scene where I need to enter a tunnel. I have a machine gun, and I already know that there are several vietcong just beyond the tunnel entrance. So I beging to lay down fire, and empty the whole magazine on the 4 of them. And guess what: At least 2 of them survive entirely unharmed every time! And not just that! But they turn against me, run towards me (while I am still firing), pull up their guns to aim (I am still firing), and kill me with a single shot! After a number of attempts, I finally make it into the tunnel, clear out everything that is in there, and pick up a semi-stationary machine gun. Since I have played through the scene several times already, I know that more VCs will be waiting for me at the tunnel entrance. So I position myself close to the entrance and ready my stationary MG. I hear them talking and come closer, so I begin to fire. The 3 of them run into my fire. I hit them with all head and body shots. A whole amo belt worth of heavy fire. Yet not a single one of them goes down! Instead, one of them raises his gun and kills me with a single shot! And I am even in a prone position and mostly taking cover around the bend of a tunnel! Give me a break! Vietnam certainly was tough, but I refuse to believe that a VC walks away entirely unharmed after taking 50 or more bullets to the head! Oh, and what makes things worse is the save-game system, which only allows a small number of saves (around 4, typically) in each level. So you will play through the same stupid situations over and over again. Also, the team mates are just plain dumb. They are OK when it comes to fighting the VC, but they move around like complete retards. In a game that features a lot of tunnel-fighting, it just isn't OK that your team mates block you from moving back or forth. This happened to me a number of times. All you can do is go back to the previous save-game. Argh! Thanks, but no thanks! This could have been one awesome game. Technically, it certainly is. But play-balance-wise, someone took a lot of shortcuts. A bit more testing and fine-tuning would have turned this into a 4 or 5 star game. I play a lot of FPS games, and gameplay-wise, this one comes in dead-last!	-1
Not worth spending time or money on! I would rather buy G.I. Joe game than this sorry rip off the original!!	-1
This game was really fun at first.  Barcelona is fun like the city of Amn in Baulder's gate...but that's all that there is to this game.  The people that join you just follow you around.  You can't interact with them or control and develope them like Ice Wind Dale or baulder's gate.  If you want a hack and slash, get Dungeon Seige...if you want a real rpg with a plot, get BGII.	-1
I'm at a lull in between playing the newer releases, and decided to pick up Lionheart on a whim. Even at a fraction of the original cost, I found this game virtually unplayable. While the premise is original, I found the subject matter distasteful (too much focus on the inquisition), and the graphics tiny, outdated, and the character avatars really, really ugly. The game had an unfinished quality, and I found the combat at the beginning way too hard. Entering into dungeons my character was immediately mauled and killed. There is almost no tutorial, and no learning curve for new players, and hardly any place to get money or weapons. Also I chose and built a female character, I was surprised to discover that her voiceset sounded very male! Err.... I'll have to give this game 2 stars. The game had promise, but needed about another year of development. Black Isle has produced better.	-1
I bought this game and was hoping for a fun RPG experience.  I thoroughly enjoy almost every RPG type game I play, and I was really excited about this one.  My fiance and I both bought copies so we could play the multiplayer version as well!  We instantly had problems installing and loading the game, we each had to uninstall and reinstall it once in order for it to work.  We have high-end systems, since we both work in the computer game industry. We finally got them both working and we started playing.  The character generation is pretty fun - I give them points for that.  It's complex and interesting, I enjoyed making my character.  So then we do this getting out of jail quest, and get a spirit and that all is interesting too.  Finally we get unleashed in to the game and that's where it all goes downhill. First thing is you're in this gigantic town and you basically have to talk to everyone.  I enjoy this part of RPGs, but in moderation.  We spent about 30 minutes talking to different NPCs, then decided to go find something to kill.  We immediately got our butts kicked by some critter, I can't remember what.  My fiance quit at that point and I decided to go back to the town and talk to more NPCs.  I get one to give me a quest - Go find this guy and talk to him (yippee!).  So I go find the guy, he immediately calls over a bunch of thugs, they kill me, game over. At that point I quit, because playing a game is supposed to be FUN, not frustrating.  I don't recommend this game, I think it's a waste of money.  There are so many good games out there!  Try Dungeon Siege for a much more fun RPG, or even the D&D games like Temple of Elemental Evil and Pool of Radiance.  Also, Morrowind is much better than Lionheart.  Any of those would be a better choice!	-1
When I first read about this game I thought it would be one that I could enjoy. I am an RPG addict. This game, however, was not the RPG it promises to be. Very boring, mini map has no waypoints to help you along, and some of the quests appear to be broken. This game no longer spins in my disc tray.	-1
Dull, dull, dull...  This game is really not up to the standard we have come to expect from Black Isle and Interplay.  Primary Headaches:  Inability to pause and target enemies during combat. (Makes archers and magic users just about useless), Boring quests - the kind we expected in the early days of roleplaying.  Games is not the most stable I have seen either.  All in all, you are better off going back and paying an earlier Black Isle game.	-1
I love history, and I love RPGs, so it goes without saying I was anticipating "Lionheart" for a long time. The game has an interesting premise, and it uses Fallout's "SPECIAL" system.  I thought that Reflexive and Black Isle could not possibly screw up this great combination.  Boy was I wrong.  "Lionheart" is poor in every category.  This terrible game simply does not have one redeeming quality about it. To start off with, the 2-year outdated graphics are mediocre, creature and character animations stink, and the artwork is nonexistent.  Every screen is covered end-to-end in grey or black and has the visual appeal of an IRS 1040 form or a dirty ash tray.  You can let your imagination run wild with how exotic and cool Medieval Europe could have looked after a great big cosmic magical rift.  I say "you" could, because the designers for this game obviously didn't.  Where are the snow-capped mountains, exotic palaces, beautiful forests, and lakes?  They're in "Divine Divinity", that's where.  "Lionheart" looks more like Wyoming after a great big forest fire.  "Divine Divinity" is but one game puts "Lionheart" to shame in the graphics department (and everything else as well).  All of the recent Dungeons and Dragons games look better than this, because of their exceptional artwork and creativity.  Even the flop sci-fi "Harbinger" looked better than this. But graphics don't really matter that much do they?  I guess not - I could easily ignore them, but the gameplay is terrible too.  The way that the turn-based SPECIAL system has been butchered in this game is inexcusable.  A real-time game that uses a turn-based system can succeed if you can pause the game to issue orders.  That is why real-time Dungeons and Dragons have been so successful.  However, this game has the mind-bogglingly stupid feature of NOT letting you do this.  You can pause the game, but not to issue attack orders.  There is no autopause feature that stops the game for you when someone rushes onto the screen.  The tactical genius and elegance that made Fallout's combat great is nonexistent.  That leaves you with a real-time, extremely low quality Diablo clone, complete with a red bulb for health, and a blue bulb for mana.  You left-click to attack, you use a hotkey to select your active spell, and then right-click to cast the spell. How groundbreaking. "Diablo clone" would be a compliment for "Lionheart" though, because the combat engine is pitiful otherwise.  Enemies are unoriginal and poorly animated.  You reveal the fog of war by exploring ugly areas and run into ugly, repetitive enemies bit-by-bit.  They simply yell out a "raawwrrr!" and rush at you at light speed, before you can cast more than one spell or fire an arrow from your useless bow.  If you specialize in ranged combat or magic, you literally will not survive the first area of this game, no matter how many times you reload.  This game is more unbalanced towards melee characters than "Arcanum" was. The game's intrusive interface blocks your view of the world by taking up almost a third of the screen, but it somehow still manages to be functionally inadequate.  (A dubious accomplishment).  You only get 7, that's right, 7 hotkeys for spells, and other actions.  Compare that with games like Neverwinter Nights, which made full use of the "F" keys for 36 total hotkeys.  Expect to find yourself casting the same few unimpressively-animated spells over and over. Needless to say, I did not finish this game, so I cannot comment about the story from start-to-finish.  However, I can say that the portion of the game that I played through offered no indication that it would be special.  "I am some sort of mysterious chosen one, and some bad men want to kill me because of it" is the basic premise.  A cliche storyline is nothing new, and some games are still great in spite of it, but it's not enough to make you want to toil through a game that is just plain bad. I wanted to love this game, but I can't.  I tried to like it, but I failed.  Reflexive alienated hardcore RPG fans by screwing up the "SPECIAL" system, and then screwed up the mindless action so that "Diablo" fans could hate it too.  I wish that I could say that it's a simple hack-and-slash adventure, but I can"t, because the hack-and-slash aspects of the game stink.  "Lionheart" is by far the worst RPG that I have played since before Baldurs Gate, and I am thinking it might be the worst I have ever played.  A trashpile like this doesn't even deserve the bargain bin.	-1
This game is pretty annoying in many ways. The combat is simply clicking on people and watching them unil they die. The magic system is poorly thought out and playing as a mage is very tedious because the simplest spell costs too much mana, yet spending massive spellpoints barely increases their power.  Heal heals 4-5 points of damage at level one, and 12-13 at level 81!!! NPC tagalongs are useless in combat because they are destroyed with amazing ease by enemies and there is no way to bring them back, and worse than useless since they like to run around and lure lots of monsters to you. Once you get out of barcelona, there is really no questing just more hacking and slashing.  Even this might be ok if it was more involving; you just watch you guy hack them to pieces and occasionally run away.  The spells are pretty useless in combat and hard to select anyhow so you do not end up using them much. There is no marking of exits/entrances etc. even after you have been through them, so that walking around is VERY tedious and annoying at higher levels, especially since in the first half of the game you will be going to the same places in the sewers OVER and OVER.  Finding all the entraces to the various levels takes careful attention to detail, too. Anyhow, I think this is the last black isle game I will buy; maybe I will get Baldur's gate III if such a thing is ever made, or fallout 3, but only from the ten dollar clearance rack....	-1
I remember buying this game and thinking, "this is going to be another cool shooting game, kinda like Max Payne."  Well, I was completely wrong on both accounts.  This game is terrible, and it is NOTHING like Max Payne.  The graphics are some of the worst I have ever seen in a video game, even for the time period that this game came out in.  The controls are also some of the worst I have ever encountered.  The worst part of this game, however, is the plot/gameplay.  In short - there is no plot.  This guy just runs around killing things while his stupid pet does dumb tricks that a real dog would never do.  This game is a cheap knockoff of Max Payne, and it performs poorly.  I would recommend sticking your head in the toilet over buying this game.  At least you can take a shower afterwards.	-1
I wasn't a big fan. I love all the Super Monkey Ball games, but with this particular one, just like in the very first game, it is to focused on the playing levels (that don't give a lot of time), and not enough of the story line. Just "play this level in the sky then in the water then in a volcano" no story behind it like most of their games have. It's to just have in your collection then to have fun playing.	-1
Sometimes I wonder about video game reviews. This is definitely one of those times. Maybe it's just me, but this game was horrible. People say it was fun, it was cool, and it looked great. And it might have been all those things....but it wasn't enjoyable. In fact, it was hardly understandable. There was very little story to the actual game, and when it does rear it's ugly head, it's only strength is the graphics. The story is presented in such a way that every scene seems to be intentionally ambiguous, to the point where you begin to wonder if there's a large section of the game you may have missed where they actually explain the story rather than present more questions. No explanations are given for anything, short of 'there's a princess that needs saving and you're stuck with the job'. The voice acting is just horrible, and the game play isn't even all that fun.  Much like the popular Onimusha series, this game features customizable weapons, the Diskarmors, each with different magical abilities and elemental alignments. There's even an optional dungeon nearly identical to Onimusha's Dark Realm, but I'd discovered it by accident, and found no reason to actually go through it. I beat the game within four days with no difficulty, and even after beating it I still didn't understand what was going on.  If you're that drawn in to playing the game, look it up on Youtube or borrow it from a friend if you can first. Don't be fooled by reviews...this game is hardly worth the $8 I paid for it.	-1
Rygar the Legendary Adventure is a very fun game with beautiful graphics and a vast variety of attacks, but unfortunately, those are the only real positives.  First of all, the game is just way too short.  It can take under four hours to beat it.  Because of that some of the adventure elements don't really fit in.  You have to play the game four times in order to get all the mystic stones, which isn't really worth it considering that more than half of them are useless, and that it really isn't as fun to play the game four times as the designers hoped it would have been, despite the different difficulty levels in each replay.  Among other problems with Rygar, one is that the story and voices are just awful.  Of course not every game takes itself seriously when it comes to story, but the atrocities in this one are just too much.  What's also lame is that from the middle of the game on most of the environments look more or less the same.  You're always around some red or brown, hot mountain, lava field, or something else reddish or brownish.  The final area was also way too short and pathetic, and aside from the bosses, there are only a few kinds of enemies, most which are smaller than you are.  Numerous things could have increased the value of this game.  First, they just should have made it a lot longer, preferably at least within the 8-10 hour range keeping the difficulty around the game's "HARD" level.  This would have allowed for a greater variety of environments and enemies, and it would have left room for all the mystic stones to be in.  Many of the mystic stones also should have done cooler things than what they did.  There actually is an interesting back story to the game if you read some of the texts you pick up, but the current story is executed just too poorly to accept even for a game you know won't take itself seriously.  The presentation could have used vast improvement.  In short, Rygar the Legendary Adventure is a disappointment because it had stunning potential that just didn't have its best brought out.  Lack of ambition most likely held it back.  The negatives outweigh the positives enough for me to only be able to recommend it as a rental.  Hopefully the tentative sequel, if made, will be better.	-1
this game is awsome!...devil may cry 1 was very good.and number 2 is even better.its just the right amount of difficulty.and loads very fast.u can even buy tecneques[.]I would of gave this game even more stars if I could but it only let me put 5.this is the best game ever![.]	-1
I bought this game knowing that it was bad. I read the reviews, I watched gameplay videos, and I thought I was prepared. I wasn't. Besides the improved graphics, there is nothing about this game that makes it better than the first. In fact, I'd say it's worse. The camera is absolutely awful. You can't move it manually and it doesn't eve move to focus in on whatever you're targeting. The targeting system itself is atrocious. You cannot turn off the auto-targeting which makes missions where you have to hit targets while enemies infinitely spawn quite difficult as the closest enemy is automatically targeted, not the target you need to hit to get to the next area. Dante is also a ridiculously slow runner which makes the speed based missions in the game harder than they really should be. The swords are almost completely useless. For a boss fight you'd be better off shooting for ten minutes. Weapon collecting has become more of a side-quest unlike how it is in the first game where it's more integrated into the storyline. Overall this is a bad game and I would not recommend playing it ever. If you really want to go through that storyline like I did, just watch a play through or read a synopsis.	-1
What was Capcom thinking when they said THIS would be a GREAT idea!? Everyone must have been having a bad year to have created this monstrosity. We left the world of Dante with high hopes for the next installment of the DMC (Devil May Cry) series. We knew there was going to be another game and we welcomed it with open arms. Until we got it. This game is downright bad. Though the first game had hokey dialogue, just like this one, it made up for it in the level of excitement and badassery that was Dante. Now we got a Dante that has a slightly longer coat, the ability to run on walls like in the Matrix and a nonexistent level of cockiness.  Dante, as a playable character, is not alone. We are forced to use a separate disc with this Lucia woman to get the grand scheme of the story. Each disc, individually, can be played through in about four hours (eight total), but the creators of the game expected you to switch back and forth between the two to understand what in the world was going on. I value my PS2 tray too much to be switching between the two like that so I played them separately and stitched together what I didn't know without a great stretch of my imagination. Simply put: the story was awful. Why Dante would even get involved with the young Lucia and the ancient Matier is reduced to the simple fact that demons are running amok. At the very least, in the first game, Dante was interested in participating in Trish's request because of her resemblance to his mother. There is only a promise of a story from Matier. So I have to run around battling demon tanks, buildings, helicopters, monkeys, aquatic tendrils, and a boss fight that is as easy as eating pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving for a story? ...I'd rather waste my time watching paint dry.  If you're hellbent on playing it, play the Dante disc and just assume the storyline. There's no other reason to play this game except for a lingering sense of pride in the DMC series.	-1
I cant even describe how bad this game is, compare it to the first one and you have a choclate poopy mud stain in your PS2 collection. gameplay is repititive AND TOO EASY! dante never talks, and i liked him in the first and in the 3rd. if you want to get all devil may cry games do your self a favor and pick only 1 or 3. I have the game guide in may bath room...  but not for reading.	-1
Not even close to the original Devil May Cry, this one really lacks story. After you beat the game (which took me 3 days, not even playing it alot during that time) you'll be thinking "that's it"? The camera angels pretty much suck, that seems to be one of the main problems with all of the DMC games though. I should've waited till this dropped to $20 but I liked the first one so much I figured it would be worth the $50 but it wasn't. This is definately a prime example of a game not worth the hype.	-1
Devil May Cry was a classic with great gameplay and had lots of style...This...doesn't!  I will make this a short review... The game had good visuals like the original but was lacking on good story and was waaaaaaay too short and too easy.  Devil May Cry was easy to learn and was a bit of a challenge but this was just complete bull..  Too easy and waaaaay too short.  This is nothing like Devil May Cry 1.  Overall I have to give this..  2.2 out of 5 stars  Game is lacking in a lot of places and is just painfully bad.  No were near the original Devil May Cry..This game has lots and lots of flaws..Just wait for Devil May Cry 2 comes out cause hopefully it will be waaaaay better then this (...)..  (...)	-1
Let's be honest. Judging by the trailers and magazine ads, the sequel to the PlayStation 2 smash hit, Devil May Cry, it looked very cool. And it was the day I got it and the strategy guide. Wall flipping and multi-directional shooting was very fun and easy to pull off. Unfortunately, it wore off soon enough and after a few months( and beating the superior first one on both difficulties ), I realized how shallow and disappointing DMC2 was. Ignoring the confusing and laughable storyline, even the gameplay is watered down. The game plays likes it on the Easy Automatic difficulty of the first. And don't be fooled by the other difficulties. The only real challenge lies in the Dante Must Die or Lucia Must Die, and even so, it's nowhere near as challenging as the first. You get 3 different swords, but your first one serves a better purpose than the other 2, despite what the guide says. And they lack any kind of personality and level of coolness like Ifrit or Alastor. Guns consist of your trademark pistols, shotgun, sub-machine guns( which is, in my opinion, the worst set of weapons to have on here ) and a rocket launcher. Now, due to the open levels, which are pretty dull most of them, you'll practically be using your guns a majority of the time instead of the swords, and that sucks. The 2nd disc is the other character's story, Lucia, who is almost like Dante, but a little better, a little worse in some aspects. She doesn't have any guns, save for the bowgun. She carries swords, sticky bombs and throwing daggers. The best thing about her is you actually have to use her melee combat moves over her projectile weapons, unlike Dante, which is the opposite. Like I said earlier, wall running and jumping is cool, but it serves NO purpose whatsoever. It just there for decoration. Voice-acting is even worse than the first with Dante spewing out the most generic one-liners I've ever heard. Now, for all the horrible things I've said about this bland sequel, there are a few redeeming qualites. One is the graphics are quite good and the CG is great. There is a ton to unlock like secret characters and an endless dungeon. And both Lucia and Dante aren't all that bad to play as. Hopefully, they'll get it right in Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, which looks infinitely better that this, and reclaim the fun and cool factor of the first. I give a terrible 2 out of 5. Tis a sad day indeed. This is Sean David, signing off.  Until then,  Semper Fi, Carry on.	-1
Good lord, Capcom, what were you thinking when you released DMC2? I can't believe how dumb someone could be. Almost everything sucks, Dante isn't very hardcore anymore, the levels are too open(you can use guns to beat the game, seriously), it's too dang easy, and it's too dang stupid for it's own good. Capcom should be tortured for this. Devil May Cry 3 WILL be better than this. Believe me, I'm a big DMC freak.	-1
First of all it keeps repeating itself, and it never stops. You keep killing the same creatures over and over again. This is a boring game, their is really no point in making this game. Dante bairly says a word for the full 6 hours. That right folks, this game is 6 hours long. Most of the best gamers in the world will beat it in 3 hours. The story is terrible and I am not looking forward to the third installment, if there is going to be one.	-1
When the first devil may cry was released, the public was blown away. Dante was cool in everyway, he had bad ass moves, even more bad ass weapons, and just new how to give the baddies a hard time. Devil May Cry 2 was looking to be the breakaway hit that surpassed the first in everyway. However, it almost falls short in evry single aspect form the forst game. There only two points that have improved in Devil May Cry 2. the  first being the controls of the game, they still say much the same, very fluid and easy to adapt to. I also found it a nice change to have a second playable character. The problem with this character is that her moves are almost exactly the same as Dante's she just moves a bit faster. As for the storyline,...well there really is no storyline. The first Devil May Cry was great because not only did you get to obliterate hoards and hoards of baddies, but it was all packed to gether with an excellent storyline. Once you finish this game, you feel like you actually know less about who Dante actually is, because the storyline is EXTREMELY confusing. Another adition, which could have come off as either a good or bad thing, is that the level size is MUCH bigger. Unfortunately in this game, it is a very bad thing, since you spend most of your time brainless tapping the button that fires your guns. As a matter of fact, when you get to the flying bat on the roof top, the only way to hit it is to continously mash the fire button, and since the game has auto aim, there is no strategy! The whole point of having both a sword AND guns is so that you can use them both, and in this game you will find yourself using your guns MUCH more than your sword. This also makes leveling up your sword with red souls pointless, since most of the time your not using it! I'm not saying this game is completely empty of any entertainment, there are shining moments when you find yourself creating huge combos, and yes you still feel like a bad ass, SOMETIMES. If your looking at this game because the first blew you away, you may just want to rent it, because the game is EXTREMELY easy, and you will probably beat it within five hours of picking it up. If you haven't played the first one and your thinking of buying the second. DON'T! Buy the first one, rent the second, believe me its not worth your money to buy!	-1
If you loved the first DMC, then stay clear of this stinking attempt to gobble up your money on the success of the first.  The balance of weapons is off, the difficulty is a joke, and there is no real reason to want to play further than an hour into it.  No attention to detail, basically it falls flat on it's face.	-1
At one point in Devil May Cry 2, Dante tells another character, "Devils never cry..." However, if Dante laid the money down to buy this game, The "coolest character ever made" (said Playstation Magazine) might actually cry. The saddest part about this game is that Capcom took a sure winner with amazing potential and took a HUGE step backwards with this sequel. To fully see why this game is literally so-so, you have to look at the positives and negatives. The Bad: Beyond the horredous story (Never truly fleshed out when it is and why Dante showed up), the biggest fault with this game is that it is extremely short and way too easy. I sat down at 9 in the morning on a day off and by 10 PM, with a few breaks, I had finished every nook and cranny of the game, including the lame Diesel costume changes. (Perhaps Diesel gave Capcom money to help finish the game). That's about 10-11 hours of playing (without cheats) to find everything...on two discs. With the gameplay dumbed down and with a story of almost porn quality, you would think other aspects of the game would make you happy. Unfortuantely, you'd be wrong. To begin with, there's the blasted camera. Many a time I cursed Dante as I could not see the action since the camera would not move. Capcom, please, make the camera moveable with the right analog stick. In one level I got stuck behind a pillar of light and could not see where the enemies were or what I was attacking. Ugh. The enemies: Not much variety here and you know there's something wrong when they bring back baddies from the first game (that was annoying). The graphics: They are exactly the same as the first. Barely a step up. That's weak. Also the Music is monotonous. Except for the "power up screen", the musis stays the same for the whole game. Again, I have to emphasize: The script and the voice acting are very bad.....and somewhat rehashed from the first game. Where are the awesome weapons from the first game. I loved upgrading the gloves and cool sword. In this one, you can upgrade, but it doesn't really do much. Is there some good: Yes, but not much. This game is great for blowing off steam since all you do is blast baddies the whole game. While there is alot to be annoyed at throughout the game, it can be fun, especially trying to build up to "S" level combos (the ONLY place I found something challenging was trying to get the combos). Some of the bosses are well designed. Not necessarily difficult, just pretty to look at until the level ends. I was a huge fan of the first DMC and I thought this one would be great, but I have been very disapointed by this game and Capcom should be ashamed for putting out what feels like an extremely rushed game that takes a great character and premise and sullies it. Poor Dante is probably sobbing somewhere. Bottom line: You can RENT it if you dare, but DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.	-1
This game is one of the reasons why I don't even own a PS2 anymore so jus hear me out for a minute! When the first came out I bought a copy and I was lucky to find out that the first game had alot to do and the physics of the fighting moves you unleash on enemies was fantastiv but this game was a total BLAARGH! First off the graphics look worse than the first! It has only been proved with PS2 that they have some out of date game engines that they recycle for PS2 games! Thus making the game just look like a horrible demo. I don't like this game, in my opinion just concentrate on the first!	-1
The Gothic thriller taken to new hype. And in that last sentence there is one word that does not belong: Gothic. DMC 2 is essentially Shinobi Redux. There is no story, no mystery, and little more than pressing the buttons to acheive moves. Pros: I strain to find any. But, Disc 2...Lucia's quest is a little better than Dante's. Still has all the cons, though she reminds me of BloodRayne. Cons: 1. Lack of a storyline, of any kind. 2. The camera angles are so bad that most of the time you are lost or don't know what you are fighting. 3. Dante's modeling is from a far distance and the combat is rhetorical at best. 4. It mimics Shinobi in most aspects. There's the empty city, deranged tanks and even copies of those hated dogs from Stage 3-A. 5. The swordplay was taken directly from Onimusha & Onimusha 2, it's that obvious. But, in this game...the sword will get you killed. It's all guns, no glory. 6. Dante is slow. He runs through the city in a crawl-like way and it takes forever to get from one place to another. 7. The beginning takes a lot from Tomb Raider and is quite pointless. You don't know where you are in this game and there's nothing to find. 8. It takes forever to power-up and there's not enough enemies in a single mission to get you the orbs to power-up. 9. The attack method is not similar to the original and The Matrix stunts won't get you the high demon rank. 10. Graphics. Twice the graphics, huh? The graphics can't hold a candle to Onimusha 2 in gameplay. The cutscenes aren't anywhere near Onimusha (1 or 2)and there is a scene where Dante slides down a pipe - similar to Final Fantasy X, though far less impressive. The main gameplay is reminiscent of BloodRayne...though...not in its league. Ok, I gave you 10 reasons for the my point. Capcom has been in a frenzy to produce so much this past year and ahead with Resident Evil Zero, RE 1 remake, and RE 4. The company has given us high quality games such as the Onimusha series, the original Devil May Cry and others. This leads me to believe that this DMC was overhyped and underdeveloped. This wasn't intended as a bash review and I didn't want to write it in that way, honestly. I looked forward to this game for so long. My suggestion is that you rent this one first, see if you like it, and during that week rental...surely you can pick up the game if you are into it. I'm sorry fellow gamers, but the hype doesn't fit the game. This is not Devil May Cry...it's a confusing mess. It is not Gothic, not dark, and holds no bearing to the namesake. I'll probably get a lot of unhelpful votes from the hardcore, but I'm in the top 5000 reviewers (feel free to check my rank) and I won't steer you wrong. Robert Eldridge (...)	-1
Devil May Cry was hailed as one the best action games of all time when it was released. It combined detailed 3D graphics with the frantic action of 2D platformers and topped it all off with a sinister gothic theme. Unfortunately, Devil May Cry 2 is only a shadow of those things. The gameplay remains very similar to the first game...but the story, enemy design, dialogue, and weapons all seem slapped together without much thought. The main character is still Dante, but he is also accompanied by a female playable character named Lucia (whatever happened to Trish?). The areas are now much more wide open...which is fitting for a urban setting, but most enemies just let you pummel them to death from afar. It lacks the sense of urgency and danger that was present throughout the first game. Everything just has a rushed and unbalanced feel to it. It's a shame Capcom let this happen to a series that showed so much promise. If you are looking for a good 3D action game, I suggest Rygar or Shinobi instead (or the first Devil May Cry if you don't already own it).	-1
I got Dead to Rights hoping for some great shoot-em-up action. And while I got that in bucketloads, it's only rarely engaging. The story plays out like film noir and has a hardened cop called Jack Slate (who really belongs in an 80s action movie) investigate his dad's murder only to end up being framed for various crimes and in the middle of huge conspiracy.  And so the game has you blast and fight your way through prisons, mines, air-force bases, dockyards, factories, cliff-sides, nightclubs, construction yards, hotels and out of control airplanes all while accompanied by your faithful dog Shadow, the game's best feature. It feels like a cross between&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Die-Hard-Vendetta/dp/B00007E1OG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Die Hard Vendetta</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Resident-Evil-4/dp/B000P46NKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;as you seem to do nothing but shoot generic bad guys from start to finish. It becomes incredibly boring and is only slightly redeemed by a few intense shoot-outs. There IS the occasional fisticuffs but the mle system is poor to non-existent and there is no skill involved in defeating your opponent outside of button mashing.  Plus, the graphics are rotten. The cut-scenes look right out of a mid-90s CD-ROM and the gameplay graphics may look adequate but have a very jerky habit and the camera system will drive you crazy. And the voice acting is quite bad too with the exception of a few lively characters. The guy who plays Jack Slate sounds as bored as a living human can possibly be.  I can't rate this game particularly high. Find it somewhere cheap if you must, otherwise it's not the best shoot-em-up out there and I suggest you invest your time and money in something else. The series took-off however and was followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dead-To-Rights-II/dp/B0002CTTQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dead To Rights II</a>) (sadly not available on the Gamecube),&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dead-To-Rights/dp/B00092A6ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dead To Rights</a>) and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dead-to-Rights-Retribution/dp/B001URRH0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dead to Rights: Retribution</a>.

It's supposed to be really hard.  If you're up for the challenge then try it but if not then FORGET IT.	-1
If you like wimpy over-head view games you'll like this one. The characters are so small they are almost undistinguishable from each other. The worlds are hard to find your way through. Unless you have a walkthrough it would be nearly impossible to find your way through this game. And even then it's still almost impossible not to get lost. I quit after only a few sessions. Because the fun level is almost zero. You can play with a friend. And then both of you can get lost and not have fun.	-1
this a horrible game. theres more bad stuf in the game than good.first off i did think that being able grab people as hostages was great.i also liked that he was alowed to say [profane words]. but if you ever notice most people face look the same in this game. also if you ever shoot at a window it doesnt break no sound nothing. the graphics are horrible they look like n64 graphics. and in some parts of the game u have to go jumping off edges and stuf com on thisis a shooting game not and adventure. also you cant really explore or go in another direction its just one way. everythings scripted and the peolpe know your here right away. like they know your supposed to go that way. the frame rate in the game is excelent cause the graphics [are bad]. and for a game that has great frame rate they should of atleast put a multiplayer like 007 cause its smoothe like this game. but they didnt. justsave your money its not worth it.	-1
*Die Hard Vendetta seems like a cool idea at first: a game based on the "Die Hard" movies as a first person shooter with an entirely new storyline. However, it ends up as a disappointment to anyone who has ever played superior first-person shooter games like Timesplitters 2 or any of the James Bond games. *The graphics of this game are the worst I have seen on the Gamecube. Gameplay graphics are "ok", but the cut-scene graphics are absolutely terrible. Why even bother with the cut-scenes? The storyline is ridiculous, but that wouldn't bother me if the game offered more in the gameplay department. *Controls can be very frustrating, falling from what seems like very short distances can take away more life than you expect. But even with these frustrating controls, the game turns out to be very, very easy. You could beat it in a day if you want. *However, there are some cool things. Talking to individuals you come across can be very entertaining and helpful. Some of the objectives you pick up on your missions are actually pretty fun. The "auto-aim" is not as annoying as it can be in other first-person shooter games. *In short, I'd advise you to rent this game first. It is certainly not the best, or most entertaining, shooter on the market. The language in the game is very strong, as if they added many excuses to drop the "f-bomb" just because they could. If you're a die-hard fan of the "Die Hard" series, then you might want to check it out. If not, you probably shouldn't bother.	-1
This review is not intended to thoroughly downplay the qualities of this game.  The graphics are stunning -- unlike anything I've ever seen before.  The music is great, especially the opening sequence which would have worked magnificently on the silver screen.  (I won't go into story details; you can get that easily enough.)  But, fellow TRON-fans, this game just isn't worth it.  The gameplay is fun only to a degree.  It's addictive, certainly, but only in so much as you keep on wanting to see that pay-off cut scene (which sometimes come and most of the time do not) or that grandiose image or situation that has a big connection to the 1982-hit film -- which, let's face it, is the whole reason why we're playing this game in the first place.  Also, there is no payoff at the end.  I watched the ending animation clip and thought, "That's it?  That's all you're going to give me for all this trouble?"  For, make no mistake about it, this game is a lot of trouble.  I played it on "Easy" (there are also "Medium," "Difficult," and "Insane" levels) and it was tough.  After awhile, I felt like I was just being challenged for no reason and my character was wandering around.  It was like reading an 800-page book that could have been condensed to 300 pages.  I think most people who bought or will buy this game are doing so mainly because of the unique opportunity to explore the TRON universe.  The gameplay is just an added bonus.  Unfortunately with this game, the universe you're exploring occasionally looks like the film you saw as a kid, but overall it's been revved up with extra icing and eye-candy and less actual substance.  I think the game could have been a lot better if it had looked much more like the movie.  Or perhaps if there had been gameplay scenarios like the movie.  Yes, there are a few.  For instance your primary weapon is the memory disc (that frisbee-looking thing) and there are light-cycles galore.  (These things earn this game two stars from me instead of one).  Perhaps we just weren't ready to jump immediately into the 21st century.  Maybe they could have divided the storyline into segments: one key chapter of the game taking place in the 80s (perhaps right after the film takes place), one in the 90s, and a climactic finale present day.  Those are my two cents' worth.  And I hope for the sake of a possible sequel that they echo many of the desires of other fans as well.	-1
Man I've been waiting for games with this concept to be done really good. I wish I could lament the praises of this game as so many other b-movie monster fans have here. But I just can't! Because WOTM fails! It's not a very good game! The concept is there and good. But singing it's praises stops there! The Graphics are okay. But the big problem is that the gameplay absolutely stinks! The controls are clunky and non responsive, the camera is bad, and as many other people have said; the AI for one player adventure games is way too over the top in difficulty, even on easy mode. You'll find yourself tag teamed to death by the computer without any slack, just too damn often! I just had enough of this title after trying to give it a fair chance off and on over the last few months... It makes a much more enjoyable coaster. ::sigh:: I've given this game plenty of opportunities. Challenge is good... Feeling time and time again that it's better to be lucky than good to pass a level = Bad Game! Mmmmmkay! I was neither too thrilled with the multi player gaming. Godzilla Destory all Monsters makes for much better multi player game! I can see why most hardcore gamers dislike this one.... If your an overzealous B-Grade movie monster fan you may be able to forgive the definite problems with it. But definitely a rental first IMO.	-1
Incog was in production of this game, and true, this game does have some good graphics.  True, the game includes several different monsters with different abilities.  However, many faults lie in this game.  The single-player is dull and tedious, where the computer AI is cheap and very cheap.  True, this cheapness may work in Twisted Metal: Black in single-player, but then again, you have shields that surround the car as you escape whereas in this you don't.  You can get stabbed in the back quite frequently with an antenna.  In terms of multiplayer, it's okay, but then again, Twisted Metal: Black is far better.  Overall, this game is a weekend rental at best.  Incog, please stick with Twisted Metal for the sake of your fans!	-1
Being a huge fan of Twisted Metal Black, I could not wait to purchase and play War of the Monsters (both games are made by Incog). I was ready for another highly creative and fun game that I could not put down. Boy was I disappointed. The controls are frustrating, the camera angles are EXTREMELY frustrating and confusing. Two buttons are used for attacking and your monster has the ability to grab various objects and use them either to throw or club an opponent, which is at first interesting, but soon becomes boring. I was hoping that the game would somehow incorporate the TMB's scrolling of various weapons (do I want to blast the enemy with zoomy or use environmental to zap him with a blimp?) but I found the attacks and fighting aspect of the game to be boring and routine. Even the monsters super attacks are uncreative and bland (where is the creative attacks like SweetTooth's Special Attack?)The environments are cool, but not as large, interesting, or moody as TMB. The gameplay quickly becomes monotonous and routine. The bottom line is that it contains none of the fun elements that Incog's previous game, Twisted Metal Black had, and I found myself bored with it after a day and a half of playing.	-1
Avoid this one...I wondered about this game because I saw it cheap in a lot of shops. It looks like it could be interesting & fun. It's just a bunch of chaos. Pointless, random chaos all around you is not fun. Trust me. Whatever the "mission" was at the time, the fact all these mindless "AI" (I use the term "AI" loosly here) are running wild in seemingly infinite numbers ruins the point of gaming. I got rid of it & the folks at the store I took it back to were like "I feel you".	-1
i liked the first red faction alright.  it had a lot of things going for it.. while the story may not have been the most original, the way the story unfolded was fun to watch and participate in.  the geo-mod technology was fine, and it provided several options in most areas as far as how to get to the next room.  the multiplayer was a blast, and all the mods people were coming up with were fun to mess around with.  it wasn't the best game in the world, but it was better than most, and it had heart.  but this.. this game is an insult.  the story is nonexistant, the A.I. is terrible, the weapons are unnecessary (it's not too difficult to kill anything with any gun), and it is one of the most linear games that i've played in a while.  everything that happens in this game happens because it's the only way it CAN happen.  there is no room for skill, strategy, or fun in this game.  it's truly nothing more than a mindless "bullets and blood" shooter.  that's fine and dandy.. but the way the developers have tried to pawn this off as something else is ludicrous.  first off.. there is far LESS use of the geo-mod system in this game.. not MORE, as the pre-release reviews stated.  and what little use of it there is, is completely pointless, because there aren't very many hidden areas or alternate routes that can be found by "geo-modding" through the walls like there were in the first game.  secondly.. the box hints (in rather dodgy language) that there are multiplayer type games to be found here.  but there are NONE.  sure.. you can play Deathmatch and Capture the Flag with RF2.. but not online.. you can only play it with a bunch of poorly made A.I. bots.  what a gyp!  why bother including a multiplayer part of the game IF YOU CAN'T PLAY AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE?  Ridiculous!  if you're wanting nothing more out of a game than pointless blood and gore with a plethora of huge honkin' guns to kill enemies that move with the intelligence of the old Contra enemies, and fake multiplayer against bots that either run around like idiots or camp like boy scouts, then this game delivers in SPADES.  if, however, your taste in games is a little more, shall we say, refined, then wait.. please wait.. there are a few titles coming out this year that seem promising.. most notably Deus Ex: Invisible War, the sequel to the most intelligent action game ever made.  heck.. anything would be more thought provoking and challenging than Red Faction 2.  it's not worth the plastic it's pressed on.	-1
Better than Unreal? Maybe. As good as a current FPS title? No way. The game is too short, and blowing holes in walls gets real boring after a while. This game looks good however and the parts where you get to pilot tanks and hovercraft is pretty cool but the first game had a better, longer story.	-1
I have owned this game for 3 days now and even though I'm told it's a short game, I can't get through it. I keep getting killed and instead of starting over from my own save spot like most other games, in this I have to start the whole chapter over again. This sucks as some of these are long and take a while to get back to where you were killed. This is more then just an annoyance but should be outlawed in game making. This does nothing more then frustrate and make a gamer angry. And if the game is a good one, it's bad enough but this is a lousy game to begin with and just makes me much madder and much more frustated that I ever bought the stupid thing to begin with. The graphics are terrible, the artwork is amateur, the story lame and the sounds, well, terrible!  This game is so forgettable and such a huge waste of time that I can only kick myself over and over for being stupid enough to buy it, but I, like many others, was thinking that it would be a decent game like it's predessor.  Red Faction, the first, was not a great gane but it was fun and worth playing. It was not even close to being a favorite or even worth playing again but the price was right and I felt like it was a fair deal. This one feels like I got completely ripped off! I was cheated and I have nobody to blame but me for not reading the reviews first. Live and learn. Just because the 1st game is good, don't figure the 2nd one will be as well.  You would think the makers of this would have wanted to keep the buying customers happy and make sure the second one was a good one. They blew it! And now they have their new one coming out. The Gorilla and I will be reading alot of reviews before plopping down my money again. Don't buy this one and check the next one real good.	-1
Resident Evil 2 is easily one of the most fun and enjoyable games that has come out in the past decade. It scares you enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, but the difficulty level is set exactly right so it doesn't get you frustrated. Not to mention that both of the playable characters have two missions, and once you complete those, there are several different gameplay modes rewarded to the player for completing the missions. This enhances the game's replay value quite dramatically.  So assuming that you have played this game on the original Playstation, I bet you're wondering what is different about the port offered on the Gamecube?  Well, disappointingly enough, not much. The RE2 port is just that - a port. Naturally, however, the Gamecube is a much more advanced system capable of handling much faster polygonal rates, shading, texture, and load times. The overall look is a bit smoother, but not enough to make you say "wow!". More like "hmmm...interesting". The blood is not so polygonal, and the characters are a bit smoother. If there really is any difference in the load time, it is minimal. The controls are about as good as the original - pending that you can get used to the game on a Gamecube controller. The CMVs are not changed at all. Nothing smoother, nothing overdubbed, nothing brighter or duller, not faster or slower. This can either be a curse or a blessing for you, depending on how devoted you are to the original CMV's, as the CMVs are identical to the Playstation's in every way.  So while I can't really justify owning a copy of Resident Evil 2 for the Gamecube, I would recommend it to anybody who has never played the game or does not have access to the PS version of it. Resident Evil 2 is a great game, and it continues to hold its value even to this day. If Capcom would have just done the same thing for RE2 and RE3 that they did for the original, I think we would have probably the best series in history on our hands. However, CAPCOM got lazy and decided to port the rest of the titles. Too bad, so sad.  So to sum it up, if you currently own Resident Evil 2 for the Playstation, save your money because the Gamecube version is really not all that much better.  Original game rating and contents = 9/10  "lazy" Gamecube port rating = 2/10  final score on the re-release for the Gamecube = 4/10	-1
Ridiculous...you can buy a Playstation for 15 bucks, and a RE2 game for only 7 or 8 bucks at any store. This is a pathetic attempt to capitalize off of idiots. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!You can buy it for N64 for a very cheap price as well, and the graphics are the same. As far as I know they didn't really change anything about this game. I just cannot believe they are chargine so much money for this, RE3, and code veronica-X, unbelievable. This is a great game, if you buy it for PS1/PS2, or N64. I would rather play it on PS1 anyway, it has a more classic, old school feel to it. Anyway, if you are dumb enough to actually dish out 55-200 bucks for this game, be aware you are ripping yourself off.	-1
There was like a million resident evil games and which more are coming out. What's the concept. Go around kill zombies, Takes forever, and don't be goin over your friends house to watch him play this because you'll fall asleep after your tenth heart attack after drinking soda. We were at my friends birthday party and all he did was sit there and play this until we flipped out on him and begged him to do something more social.	-1
I am really very disappointed at the poor thought that went into designing this game. I was really looking forward to it, having for many years owned Chessmaster II for the Playstation One. I was dismayed to discover that in many ways the Playstation 2 version is a step backwards. The graphics and interface of the Playstation One version are far more user friendly, with many more options for customization.  The most irritating thing about Chessmaster for Playstation 2 is the size of the chess board, which is tiny. This means you have to strain your eyes to make out the pieces, which all look alike - unless of course you like sitting 10cm in front of the screen, which rather defeats the object of using a game console rather than a PC. It is as though the designers thought of everything except the one thing that really matters: the comfort of the viewer. I find myself using the 2D display, ignoring all the 3D options, simply because it is easier to make out the pieces, but even on the 2D display they are uncomfortably small.  What's so frustrating is how much space is pointlessly wasted, which means that the chess board could easily have been twice as big if only the designers had given the matter of viewer comfort some thought. For example, the designers included displays of the pieces that have been captured. Now how pointless is that! As if it isn't obvious which pieces have been captured simply by looking at the board.  The overall interface isn't much to shout about either. For example, you might have thought that taking back a move would be possible at the touch of a button. But no, you have to bring up a separate menu, scroll down it and only then can you take back your move. There is no way to reset a game to the start, so analyzing finished games can only be done by taking back each move (which means bringing a new menu up each time, remember). If it was a rated game, the computer won't let you take back moves even when the game is finished.  Certain preferences, such as your preferred time controls, do not appear to save, which means that you have to reset them each time you load the game. Don't even get me started on the controls for playing through master games or browsing the list of opponents, which are so confusing and unintuitive it is almost a joke.  Of course, at the end of the day chess is chess, and once you get used to the irritatingly small board and clunky interface then this game is obviously enjoyable if you enjoy chess. But it is so frustrating that this game could have been so much better, if only a small amount of thought had been given to addressing the issues above.	-1
two was enough	-1
First off: The Gamecube ports of RE2, RE3 and RE Code Veronica are not meant for vets who played them already on Playstation or Dreamcast. These are for newcomers to the series, Gamecube owners who started off with the REmake and RE0. Ignorant vets will be disappointed at the lack of new content.  I became an RE fan in the spring of 1996 when the first game in the series was new. I loved it and I couldn't wait for the sequel. When RE2 was finally announced, many fans were disappointed that it had two entirely new characters instead of reusing the characters from the first game. The director explained that every RE game had to have new characters, because the previous characters had already been through their share of horrors and were now hardened by them. I agreed with him 100%. So later when RE3 was announced and Jill from RE1 was the main character, that seeded my disdain for the game. It disappointed me that the creator didn't have the balls to stick to his guns, because he was right. Later I came to accept the rehashing of previous characters in RE games, but this was the first one to do it, and it annoyed me.  Eventually the game came out and I bought it. Another irking detail niggled me right out the gate; RE3 has no "normal" difficulty setting, which is what I always play my games on when given the choice. In this game, you have to choose between easy or hard. Easy is insultingly easy and hard is harder than I like. However, RE3 does have some great gameplay innovations such as the gunpowder based ammo creation system, and the defensive dodge move, which I really wished they'd put into all following games in the series. There are also several points where you have to choose between two possible actions, and the choice you make does have an effect on what happens next. The puzzles are fairly standard for an RE game.  RE3 does nothing to further the storyline. It's a complete sidetrack. I've always personally considered Code Veronica to be the true sequel to RE2, and RE3 to be a 'gaiden' (sidestory). Recently it's come out that this is the official truth, and the only reason Code Veronica wasn't given the title RE3 was because of the business relationship (or perhaps even actual contractual obligations) between Capcom and Sony. In some cases I would argue that if the gameplay itself is good, the story doesn't matter. But the fact is, RE1 set up Umbrella as the ultimate evil jerks who needed to be taken out, and RE2 did precious little to bring us closer to that goal. By the end of RE3, you're in exactly the same place RE2 left you, no closer to taking down the bad guys. Code Veronica, on the other hand, does indeed finally take the fight directly to Umbrella. And while I'm on the subject, I really have to question the wisdom of having RE4 take place in a world where Umbrella has already been taken out completely. That's one pleasure that DEFINITELY should have been given to the player.  To sum up: I'm an RE vet of eight years and I don't recommend RE3.	-1
this game is for children who are 10 years old or less. very boring for people who want a challenge.	-1
I have written and rewritten this review, and this is my final offer. Any would-be buyers of this game, PLEASE take this as a caveat; I really want to convey just how lousy this game is. Any comparison of this game to the rest of the series is ludicrous, but anyway... As I said before, you play the game as the character Ryu, a government grunt. Mankind has been forced to live under the earth due to reasons lost in antiquity, and the citizens are placed into their positions via a rating system (a ratio - the closer the ratio is to 1, the more potential a person has, and thus the greater station this person is allowed to have). Surprisingly, the higher your ratio, the closer to the surface you are allowed to live, despite the conviction that the outside world is poisonous. Anyway, the purpose of the game is to climb out from the bowels of the earth in an attempt to reach the sky. This is the story. If you find it excellent, well, to each his own, but personally,I don't think this tale stands up to the likes of Xenosaga, .hack:infection, Suikoden III, FFX, etc. However, complicating matters is the D-Hunger gauge, against which I have railed in the past. As you progress through the game, this gauge constantly rises (increasing about 1/100 of a percent every 2-3 seconds on its own). SHould your character transform into a dragon (or use other special abilities), the rate of increase rises dramatically. Assuming you never use ANY of these abilities, however, you essentially have 20000-30000 seconds to finish your game (or about 6-8 hours). Failing at this, it is game over. In fact, you have to restart your game from the beginning. There is NO carrying over of statistics; what CAN be carried over are the weapons and armor you have equipped, any items you have stored away, the skills you have learned and "party experience", which can be used to boost your characters upon the replay. Furthermore, if you are considering beating the game on your first go around, don't. It is physically impossible (I know, I tried it out). I have a lot of words to describe this atrocious system, but "realistic" isn't the first to come to mind. I believe in innovation, when it makes a game more fun. However, this is absurd. You want the trick to beat the game? Simply play through as far as you go twice, remembering to store all of your acquired items and NEVER use party experience. That way, on your third time through, you can buff up your characters so much that they will destroy any enemy they come across (yes, I decided to go back and finish the game). Hence, an 8 hour game becomes a 24 hour game, since every scene is seen three times. The fact that you can't save often is a blessing in disguise - saving doesn't really help you anyway (the D-Hunger gauge isn't going anywhere). Oh, and for a more "realistic" gaming experience, notice that you have a "quit" command. This command essentially allows you to save at a certain spot, and then use you dragon abilities to try to acquire certain skills and items you might not otherwise be able to acquire. Oh sure, you'll die, but you can start over at the save spot, with all of the abililities now in your repertoire. In fact, the guide (which may be the most useless instruction guide in all of gaming, oftem times confusing me more than instructing me) tells you to use this strategically. The realism is overwhelming. The moral is: if you try to beat the game on one walkthrough, forget it! Instead, the system rewards ineptitude over ingenuity. If you are one of those (sad to say many) people who simply cannot stand the mainstream, and would sooner gouge out their eyes than play a game everyone else is playing, this might be for you. To be sure, the system is innovative, and I am sure it will never rear its ugly head again. However, if you enjoy fun game, or if you simply don't want to waste fifty bucks on a stinker, stay the hell away from this abomination. Play Xenosaga (another innovative game), or .hack, or even Final Fantasy X for the nth time. This game reeks...	-1
the only thing good about this game was the staying power of nina and ryu. this game was awful from start to finish. as a HARDCORE "BOF" fan since the first game back in the 90's i can say this is by far the worst they have ever made and its no wonder this game was the ending of the series. they should have kept a good thing going while they had the chance. anyone who plays this game before any of the others will most likely never choose to play another BOF game again	-1
Pros:  Interesting battle system, interesting story  Cons: SAVE COINS, SAVE COINS, SAVE COINS  You know, I was enjoying this game.  It's not the greatest game ever made, but it has an interesting battle system and a goal to look forward to.  But there is a terrible flaw: in order to save the game you must use a save coin.  These save coins are not buyable items - you randomly stumble upon them through the game, and they are scarce.  How scarce?  I played through five hours of the game, defeating five of the main bosses near the very end, and then died against the next boss.  I was unable to save any of this progress because I did not find one single save coin during this time.  I think I should repeat that.  *I was not allowed to save the game through five boss fights and five hours of gameplay.*  I don't know what kind of clown thought this was a good idea, but they should not be allowed to work on video games anymore.  I don't have five hours to piss away, just to lose it all because of absurdly poor game design.  My point is: Don't play this game unless you think you can play an entire game without dying once, because you cannot count on being able to save your game.  Total BS.	-1
Despite teasing players with potentially intricate themes, such as political subterfuge, rebellion, and betrayal, the story - lynchpin of any great RPG - of Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter never strays too far from its premise. Where plots are generally uninteresting, it is left to the characters to enrich the experience by allowing players to identify with them through the course of their development. Unfortunately, beyond the fact that Ryu actually has a personality in this installment, the characterization is as shallow as a wading pool. Once each of the three characters has established their role (and you guessed it, there are only three), the story drags towards an uninspired conclusion...  Players will reach that ending in 15-20 hours, or perhaps twice that amount, depending on their tolerance for repetitive dungeon crawling and agonizing play mechanics. If innovation means taking traditional turn-based combat and throwing most of it out of a window, including all of its good qualities, then Dragon Quarter has accomplished just that.  The combat system is very limited. Ryu can only do sword attacks, none of which is anything spectacular; horizontal, vertical, and diagonal slashes, some enhanced by fancy effects, comprise his entire repertoire. Nina can only do magic; the usual arsenal of fire, ice, and lightning spells. Rin can only do gun attacks that with the exception of a few, all look the same, but have a variety of strategic effects.  Roaming bland dungeons and engaging in tedious battles comprises the whole of Dragon Quarter's gameplay. Still, there a few details that need to be mentioned. One of the defining elements of the Breath of Fire series is Ryu's ability to transform into a dragon. It is also often the most exciting part. Unfortunately, consistent with the rest of Dragon Quarter, that ability is watered down, unimpressive, and does very little to ease the player's suffering.  In terms of visuals, the game's objective seems to be adequacy, but never to venture as far as to be awe-inspiring. The character models are bland and, the animation isn't even noteworthy. The backgrounds are either sterile corridors reminiscent of hospitals, gritty metallic platforms, or at their best, lavish medieval-style halls. This lack of diversity creates a feeling of insufferable redundancy.  Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is one of the most boring, trite, unfulfilling gameplay experiences in recent memory. Beware of a game that advertises "healing potions" on the back of the box; it may just be that such a trivial element is actually a highlight next to the rest of the features.	-1
Capcom had a good thing going with the BOF franchise. I never played the first 2, but III and IV were great games. This last installment all but killed it. First and foremost, the BEST thing about breath of fire {any of them} was the main characters ability to transform into a dragon. Its what set the BOF games apart from the rest. Is it present in Dragon Quarter ? Well, yes and no. Its there, but you definately won't be using it. Theres a gauge, everytime you use the form it drains the gauge. Theres one BIG problem. The gauge CANNOT be refilled. Nothing ..... and yes I do mean NOTHING will refill it. When it drains completely, you die. When you think about that, along with the fact that the last boss can only be defeated in dragon form ....  Well, what we have here is a BOF game without dragon transformations. Theres a ton of other things I hated, such as the gameplay, game flow, story etc. But the dragon thing ticked me off the most.	-1
the bof series has always been good...UNTIL IT HIT THE PS2! this game is flat out horrible.  the battle system is not only difficult to get used to, but when you finally do get used to it, it's NOT FUN!!!  the storyline is complex to the point where it's confusing and just too much work to try to keep up with.  the dialog being boring doesn't help much. so avoid this like the black death.	-1
I am a huge RPG fan and there aren't many games that I haven't played. I am also a quite a fan of BofF but I was very disappointed. I had to restart from the beginning of the game 3 times because I couldn't find any save token for the last 1/3 of the game.  I had to let the PS2 run for 3 days because I couldn't find any save tokens. It Sucked!!!!! Especially when your girlfriend tripped over a power cord and had to restart again!!!!!! Although Capcom had newer battle tactics and different try out for this game, you were limited with only 3 characters through out the game and you had to finish the game with a charcter who kept dying on every boss you face. If you are a truly huge fan of BofF and have to play this game, it's an interesting game. However, if you just want to try this game, please don't buy it. Just rent it...	-1
The concept had seemed interesting ever since the first Dynasty Warriors game hit the shelves, but it wasn't until now that I tried actually playing this game. As with all other one-against-many fighting games -- like Final Fight or the granddaddy of them all, Double Dragon -- the computer basically keeps trying to get at you from the back to disrupt your moves.  That's fair game and to be expected.  What I hadn't expected was that you would have a game camera that steadfastly refuses to look where you want it to.  Sixty per cent of the time, I'm swinging at enemies behind me when I can't even see them, because the camera idiotically stays in its own angle, so that when you're battling a particularly powerful enemy, he could all of a sudden land someplace you can't see and you'd have to run around begging for the camera to go back to a 3rd-person perspective behind you so you know where you're going.  Also, the 360-degree pan when you execute a super move only serves to disorient your controls.  Maybe these camera problems serve to fulfill the game designers' feeble fantasies of being filmmakers, but in a game, it's just irritating.  The fighting "system" is pathetic -- lots of button mashing in all directions.  Most of your combos are useless because you're receiving attack from all sides, so you end up using one combination over and over because anything else would be suicide.  So I played through the entire "Shu" story by doing one combo.  Yeah, I'm passing levels, but it's monotonous as hell. As the Amazon editorial review noted, there's also a lot of running around in this game.  The programmers love designing level maps chock full of dead ends, forcing you to run all the way around to get where you want.  Even on horseback, it takes friggin' forever.  And then there's the game's charming tendency to magically make three powerful enemy platoons appear right beside your commander whom you're supposed to protect...if you happen to be launching an attack against the enemy base at that time and can't find a horse, good luck.  Oh yeah, and the enemy can do the ol' "block you to death".  I had Cao Cao cornered with only 5 per cent of his health left, and all he did was put his back to the mountain, hold down block against all my eight bodyguards and myself, and waited for five minutes straight until troops from his side appeared right beside my commander and took him out in a flash.  This was 95 per cent through the level.  Call this fun? I've been able to advance very well through this game, but it's really not a good gaming experience.  And I'm willing to bet Dynasty Warriors 5 is just on the horizon...with the exact game mechanics.  Koei has made it a habit of releasing the same game over and over without making any real improvements on sequels, so I seriously doubt I will ever play another Dynasty Warriors game again.	-1
The graphics aren't bad or anything. This is actually like a mod and not a new game. You'd rather be better off without this game. It has a few extras and minigames, improved graphics and fixed bugs. Overall, it's just the same game. Don't buy it unless you got some green to burn.	-1
This is a pointless release. The VR Missions aren't even fun. There's not much to say about Substance other than that it's...pointless.	-1
I loved MK, and wanted to love this, but sadly I was disappointed....  sorry fans, but I must pass on Tao Feng.  it's sad since SO MUCH work went into this title....  hope the next one goes better....	-1
Tao Feng is a below average fighting game. It's best feature is the limb damage and nice graphics, but everything else in the game is a miss. the controls are sluggish. You'll notice a slight delay when you press the buttons to the character on screen responding to it a second later. Sound effects are weak and you can barlely hear the smacks. The novelty in this game is that when you block attack too much you can have limb damage in your arms or legs. You'll see the characters limping and do less damage when they attack. But they can repair their injuries when they do combo moves on you, which defeats the whole purpose of "limb damage". The fighting techniques are uninspired and lack that extra -oomph-. The character's animation look a bit stiff and lack fluidity which other fighting games have. In addition to the stiffness, the characters are very ugly looking. They look like platic action figures and have a bunch of tattoos on their bodies. There are only a few fighting arenas and they are mostly dark settings. There is only a few unlockables and they are not satifying. There are better fighting games out there, save your money for those. Pros: +nice graphics +good sound effects +limb damage Cons: -ugly character designs -uglier music -unresponsive controls -combos are hard to pull off -difficult to block attacks -short game -weak animation -dark looking arenas -lacks intensity -fighting techniques look generic	-1
I rented this game a decade ago and found it random and frustrating; I bought it a year ago and then played it again a week ago, and still find it random and frustrating. It just plops you as a random character in a random world with nothing tying it to Silent Hill's universe except the backdrop, gameplay, and disturbing monsters. It's like pulp nightmare. I wondered why as a teenage girl I had a knife, a pipe, a handgun, and a machine gun in my inventory (a prior save of some sort), surrounded by rusty metal fences and gigantic faceless monsters with rubber fists; even though she may be delusional, so many other things happen in the game that are just random and overly difficult that it's hard to keep me playing for long. I do want to get through all of the games since the first one is my favorite terror game, but I wonder if the rest will just be regurgitations of bizarre nightmare scenarios strung together with a thin thread of past storylines.	-1
I loved Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 4, I didn't mind Silent Hill at all either but this one just seems like Konami was trying to get male fans and give them something they want - an ugly chick in a miniskirt going around in a dark grousome atmosphere and find it 'sexy'. I disliked this one for this reason. The gameplay I didn't enjoy either. So this one was out of me. I own the game and prefer the other 3, this one was the crappiest of the lot. Don't bother with it.	-1
What with all the excellent reviews of SH 3 floating about the web, I decide dthat my previous 3-star review clearly didn't take all aspects of the game into account. So I went and bought a walkthrough guide, took three days and completed everything. And I'm sorry to say, I now think less of Heather and her ensemble cast of cliched characters than I did before. SH 3 is a game only to be played by fans of the series, and even then, only if those fans can get it cheap. It follows the story of Heather, a young girl thrown into a nightmare world of androgynous, ambiguous creatures and hellish ocations, in the search for who killed her father. Of course, there are plot twists, but only those of us that have completed SH 1 will understand them fully - and even then, they're about as predictable as a wino with a $10 bill outside a liquor store. This game is all mouth and no trousers - or, in game terms, all graphics and no substance. I guess that criticisms against the PS 2 are fairly levelled, then, when people say Sony's developers aren't concentrating on originality anymore. SH 1 (on the PS 1) is a magnificent title, and, despite the now-poor graphics, still packs a creepy, dramatic punch, full of melancholia and tense atmosphere. Silent Hill 2 (PS 2) is an Opus, going far deeper into the psychology of fear than many films and novels do, and show exactly how affecting a Survival Horror game ought to be. It wasn't action-heavy, but was all the more affecting because of that. SH 3 does none of the above. It takes some highly-accomplished character models, throws them into anonymous backgrounds that lack character and originality, poorly-designed, and rehashes some of the best-loved levels from the prequels (as I remember, SH 1 had 2 hospitals listed on the map - why are we still stuck in the same one now??) and really pointless characters. Where are the endearing, innocent Cheryls and Lisa Garlands? The morose, powerfully enigmatic Angela Oroscoes? The magnificently disturbing James and Marias? Missing. And what we're left with is Heather (consummately annoying), Douglas (hopelessly underdeveloped as a character) and Claudia, a cult member whose total lack of reason and sense of purpose is matched only by the weakness of the game's 'explanation' of her raison d'etre. Controls do nothing new, Survival Horror in this incarnation will always be a slightly flawed system, but does the job just fine. Sound is good, too, with the voice acting being of a slightly higher standard than before. Shame the script is so awful, then. I have played Silent Hill 2 repeatedly. I will not play Silent Hill 3 again. Five times through this mess is enough for anybody. If you're into gorgeous graphics without any substance or atmosphere, knock yourself out. If you're looking for something a little more mentally challenging, get Fatal Frame 2 or wait for Silent Hill 4. Very poor indeed.	-1
I was looking forward to playing this game because I greatly enjoy the TV show. But like someone before me mentioned, it was too easy -- I finished playing it in about 4 hours. There are too many hints and the clues are blatantly placed (even if you aren't into the game and you just want to win, all you have to do is drag your mouse over various areas and wait for the mouse pointer to turn green, collect the clues, and then it all comes automaticaly together). Spoon fed. I do think, however, if it was too hard, people would get frustrated with it. But for fans of forensic shows, or even someone who has basic knowledge, this game is a breeze. Which is frustating in itself, because you play the game, anticipating it getting harder with each level, and that just doesn't happen. Hopefully if they make another version of this game, they'll take some time and think up more complex plots that require greater deduction in order to win.	-1
I got this game as part of Neverwinter Gold.  I have heard nothing bad about Neverwinter and with a second expansion coming out I bought Neverwinter Gold since it was the same price as Neverwinter.  I finished Neverwinter Night last weekend.  It was a great game.  I love every part of it.  It is the best representation of D&D in a computer game since the early days. But....Shadow of Undrentide is seriously lacking.  First, you start out being "trained" as an adventurer.  My character was twenty second level by the time I start this add on so I would hardly say that a player of that level would be in that situation.  It seemed like the creators wanted this to be a separate game using the same game engine, but decided on an add on instead.  This can be the only reason for the next flaw, which is they dump the hench men from the original for a new set which are seriously lacking the depth of the original ones.  I only raise this issue b/c Bioware brings back the original Henchmen for the next add on; Hordes of the Underdark.  So why else would they make this change in the middle? So in short, this is a fair enough game if you buy the Neverwinter Gold edition, but do not waste you money on buying it on its on.  It is simply not worth the money.  I gave it two stars since this add on has my favourite prestige class, the Blackguard.  Buy it from the bargain bin.	-1
This expansion will give you A) five new classes, only two of which are worth playing (the Blackguard and the Arcane Archer are fun). The other classes are inferior to most others. B) A handful of new monsters. The madusa and the basilisk were a good addition, but I was hoping for a lot more. C) A handful of new spells, most noteworthy are the bigby's giant hand spells. When will prismatic sphere be added? It's the best spell for wizards and sorcorers! D) A few minor rule changes, such as the removal of level requirements for the use of magic items (This never should have been added into the game in the first place, and is right out of Diablo 2). E) A new campaign, which is much better than the original campaign. If you like playing solo, it's fun, but not as fun as playing online. F) The editor has been upgraded. Secret doors, and simular objects, are much easier to add into your dungeons. It would be nice if these fixes and add-ons could be gotten in a free patch, rather than a $... game!	-1
Bad Old and Slow	-1
Do not trust madcatz memory card! It may seem like a good choice at  first because it is cheaper, but this is one of those rare times that u should pay more for the brand name.  I know because i had to suffer at its hands! *wipe a tear*  I should have been warry of it when i discovered some memory from a different game on it when it was fresh out of the package, but i wasn't.  Foolishly, I moved almost all of my games' memory onto this card, big mistake! Then when i tried to play one, the system told me the memory was corrupt and I checked the other games on it and the majority of them had become corrupt! I lost years worth of memory because of that memory card! It even had a guarantee not to lose memory, HA! LIARS! Supposedly you get a bonus free case, this would be great except you wouldn't need the case if it had just matched the standard memory card size, then it would fit in the memory card holder, located in every game's case.  Its a miracle that I did not put "super smash brothers melee" onto it or I would be suicidal. The only purpose of this memory card is to retain memory and it can't do it!  buy the safer nintendo brand memory cards for an extra few bucks, you'll save yourself a lot of heart-ache, you can get your money back, but there's a lot more effort to get your memory back!	-1
Stay away from this game. It is poorly coded, patches are worthless and the price tag is [too much].  It's a perfect example of what EA Games does. They buy good companies with good products and destroy everything they had good for profits that they should not be awarded. The game has continous serious errors which occur randomly and that is the worst experience I've ever had with any games. Just that this one is a lot worse.	-1
This is 2003, and I for one have completely had it with Westwood's ridiculously bad AI.  We took this kind of unit stupidity in 1992 with Dune 2 when the RTS genre was new, but when is Westwood finally going to wake up, smell the coffee, and realize that they can't just keep putting new graphics on the same game, give a minor gameplay tweak here and there, ignore the AI and corresponding strategy elements, and expect us to dutifully keep swallowing it and shelling out the bucks? What was the original C&C's gameplay like?  Click click click click, build build build build, then click to attack (or defend) with your hundreds of units.  Repeat.  And repeat.  Until someone edges out a win because they clicked slightly faster, or the tiberium is done and a victory is squeaked in via attrition.  Now fast forward to 2003 and C&C: Generals.  What's the gameplay like?  Click click click click, build build build build, then click to attack (or defend) with your hundreds of units.  Repeat.  And repeat.  Etc ad nauseum. This isn't strategy.  In fact the so-called "Real-Time Strategy" has never been about strategy at all...it's just a marketing term to give a very rote, very brain-numbing kind of gameplay more of a cerebral spin.  Well a lot of us tolerated that lack of strategy and AI, with the hope that as the genre matured, Westwood would have enough vision (if not common sense) to finally put in a worthy AI and make these games a truly fun, strategic challenge to play.  Well they never did, and with what we're seeing, it doesn't look like they ever will...all they do is spend all of their resources - ALL of them - on graphics.  The computer "opponents" and units are all as stupid as ever, and once you learn the units and the rote action, gameplay is also just as coma-inducing.  :P Save your money and your time.  You haven't just seen this before, it's practically all you've seen if you've followed Westwood games, and anyone expecting this game to finally start using the immense amount of potential computer intelligence available to us with modern PCs, will be very disappointed indeed.  "C&C: Generals"?  More like Mindless Clickfest 2003.  Pass.	-1
Warning! Even though you're a matrix fan, and want more matrix action,just watch the movies,don't get this game. It's a total rip! The action is soooooooooooo boring, and the car driving parts of the game is just lame,very lame. But there's a bright side to this game,and it's the movie clips.	-1
Everyone has their own idea of tasteful and tacky. Rundown, shabby, lacking style, dowdy. The developers of this game took a great idea and made a few bucks off it.  Had they put a little more effort into the look and feel of the game, and possibly the story, they could have made a lot of bucks off it. As it is, it looks like a console port and plays like a console port.  The graphics, for all the hype, are hardly cutting edge, and the gameplay is buggy. Halfway through the game, instead of asking "What is the Matrix?", I was thinking "Why am I bothering?"  The only reason I kept playing was to see the filmed cutscenes, and even they were lifeless. Get this game when it goes in the dollar bin.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.	-1
A huge production budget couldn't save this abomination.  For one thing, the game feels cheap and there are very very few variations in gameplay.  for all it's vaunted separate campaign paths, it's still linear and moreover... BORING. Get Deus Ex or Max Payne.	-1
If one good thing can be said about Enter the Matrix, it's that the Wachowski Brothers were a major creative force behind the game. A 244 page script and an unprecedented 60 minutes of original cinematic footage was produced so gamers and movie watchers alike could learn the story of Ghost and Niobe (played by Anthony Wong and Jada Pinkett Smith.)  Their time on the big screen was limited, but their experiences in the game supplement the Matrix story and fill in gaps the movie left out.  The concept is pure genius, but the finished product ends up a failure because it's just not fun to play. From the start of the game, you get this unnerving feeling that developer Shiny Entertainment was in over their head.  The game engine itself has sub-par graphics considering its high system requirements and the number of bugs are atrocious (more on that later.)  I knock off another star for the bloated 3.6 gigs of hard drive space this game requires.  Running music and cutscenes off the CD's could have saved a lot of space, but we're not given this option.  Hard drives are cheap, but this is ridiculous. After spending the half-hour/hour necessary to dump this behemoth on your hard drive, you'll find yourself starting out watching a movie clip involving Ghost, Niobe, and their cynical ship dwelling sidekick Sparks.  The clips are faithful to the movie and, to their credit, Shiny added well done computer animated cutscenes of their own.  Your first mission involves infiltrating a post office to pick up an important package.  From this point, Sparks whines about the difficulty of the mission (as he does throughout the game), you choose whether you want to be Ghost or Niobe, and the game begins. As you proceed through the post office, prompts flash on the screen which provide "tips" on performing various functions such as controlling character movement and performing special fighting moves.  It would have been nice to simply hit a function key instead of Esc, select option, scroll down, select tip, etc... An extremely linear game, you're subjected to following a green arrow at the top of the screen which points which direction you should be headed, punching and kicking cops and security guards along the way.  After reading twenty tips and punching and kicking 100 security guards as you follow your little green arrow, you find you have returned right back where you started.  In fact, you'll run in circles three times just to complete the first level.  In another level, you run from one end of a level to another to flip a switch and turn a conveyor belt on.  Halfway back, you get a prompt saying someone turned the switch off.  As a result you have to retrace your steps and repeat the process all over again.  Other levels have you climbing staircases all the way up to the top floor of some factory, running to the other side of the room, then climbing staircases all the way back down again.  This mind-numbing backtracking is a persistent problem throughout the game. Character movement is mostly annoying.  Yes, you can slow things down to the now famous bullet-time and hit special key combinations to perform cool moves, but here's the problem.  It takes a lot longer to perform these moves and you're subjected to so many faceless, nameless cops and security guards that it's quicker just to run up to them and mash buttons until you knock them out and move on.  Considering lost health restores automatically by standing still long enough, it's easier this way too.  Even more problematic, the game tries to think for you when you've got your guns drawn and you end up firing at stuff you're not even aiming at.  In one level, I was supposed to destroy three control panels.  I stood pointing directly at them at point blank range while my bullets were wildly firing in every direction other than straight ahead. Bugs are prevalent.  You'll run into clipping problems (heads and arms appearing through walls) and unrealistic gameplay issues, like a door or elevator not working until you've killed every guard in the room.  In one level, I got to my objective (a telephone) before everyone was eliminated and found myself completely unable to continue the game or even move away from the telephone.  Best I could do was shut down and start over.  Sound issues are a problem for those with EAX and cutscenes are lower in volume than the sound effects.  You'll find yourself playing with the volume knob a lot.  At times, the game muted my sound card for no apparent reason at all.  A patch addresses some, but not all of these problems. Most laughable are the so-called driving sequences.  Pretty much the only difference between playing as Niobe or Ghost, completing these levels is an exercise in frustration.  As Niobe the driver, the view is limited and the controls are sluggish.  As Ghost, riding shotgun with a shotgun, Niobe's driving is so bad you're safer keeping yourself inside the vehicle.  Strangest of all are the other cars on the road, violently gyrating left and right even at a complete standstill.  You'd think they were filled with horny teenagers. After about an hour of this inane running, killing, running, killing, and following the little green arrow just to watch the next cinematic, it dawns on you that that's all there is to this game.  Out of sheer boredom, I entered a cheat so I could avoid the guards and get through the cinematics.  Even the current Hollywood fad of girl-on-girl liplocking (Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett Smith) couldn't keep me interested. All this said, I still think the Wachowski Brothers had the right idea.  If the right developers (Id, Valve, EA, Monolith) were involved, this could have been impressive.  Unfortunately, Shiny Entertainment couldn't hack the Matrix, and neither should you. Hope the review helped.	-1
this game had a lot of potential. i was ravenous as i tore open the packaging, only to find out that i had spent 50$ on a subpar game. while at first the martial arts and gunplay was exciting and hooked me, it quickly got repetitive and boring. how many times can u watch the same animations over and over before it gets dull? Plus, there are glitches aplenty. deleted games and hours spent stuck in walls are rampant. i give it a 2 because of the first few hours and because of the real cinematics incorporated into the game.	-1
Some of the graphics and character modelling look great, but that's the best the game has to offer.  The gameplay is uninspired: you run through a level, fighting guys, until you get to the end of the level, then you go to the next level.  There's no strategy to it and nothing to think about.  You just tap keys a lot.  The game levels are interwoven with cut scenes, both animated and filmed, which is actually annoying in practice; you want to play the game and you have to stop and wait far too long to do so.  Plus the inflexible game save system forces you to watch the same movies over and over again for difficult levels.  The controls are awkward.  The story, such as it is, is unnecessary, and anyway if they wanted to tell a story they should have just released it as a video like The Animatrix.  The saddest thing is that they wasted a great opportunity to make a mind-blowing game; the game is sadly conventional.	-1
Should you get this game? The best answer is yes and no. For a Matrix fan this is a no brainer ~ your going to force yourself to put up with all of the game's faults. Not a die hard Matrix fan? Then your not going to miss much here. Some things to consider... 1. This is a bad version of Max Payne. I had a lot of difficulty adjusting to the gun fights, the movement and aiming felt very jerky and unprecise.(You also have to run everywhere for some reason) This is quite the opposite of Max Payne, it only took me a few minutes to become quite good with the gun fighting. 2. The hand to hand fighting is done quite well, but hard to incorporate into large battles.(Like when mobs of guards are in your way) 3. The game can be played from the point of view of both characters, Ghost and Niobe.(just don't expect a huge difference, its just the same level from a different angle) 4. The driving sequences are, well, not my favorite. Some people may find some joy to them, but I found them rather boring and poorly done. Overall the action was put together pretty well, I'm playing through the game since I'm a big Matrix fan, but I dont' think i'll do it a second time. Ok after finishing the game I'm going to give all you action fans a little advice out there - save your money.  The videos are nice, but not incorporated very well and they are..well the only reason I would see anyone forcing themselves to play this game.  Every department needs help in a major way.  Graphics have bluring and see through polygon problems, the sound is not very well done in EAX, even with the new patch.  I found myself driving and make huge turns at just the slightest movement, taking huge jumps off small bumps and landing smack into a wall-aggrivating.  And this was supposed to be directed by the brothers?  There is no real "umph" to the story, you just run around and shoot guards most of the time watching parts of the movie you could have guessed happened if you had just watched it in the theatre and the animatrix already. To sum it up, I've already uninstalled it and and reinstalled Max Payne so I could remember how a real game is made.	-1
did not like this game and removed it from my computer as fast as i could	-1
I could not make this game play.  On an old Intel P4  at 3 ghz and Dell integrated graphics the game would not load.  The comp met the specs.  DO NOT buy unless there's some kind of guaranty just in case this happens to you.	-1
After the game installed it wanted me to register it.  At that point Windows Defender popped up and said it was known to be harmful so I closed the registration box.  I was able to open the game and proceeded to play the tutorial.  It seemed like a pretty fun game.  After getting through it I closed the game only to find another window had popped up.  This time it was my firewall saying it had blocked a transmission and did I want it to continue blocking.  I did.  At that point I just restored my computer to before the installation.  I hate it when you buy a game and then find out that it installs spyware or malware onto your computer.  I don't have enough tech knowledge to know what sort of program is embedded with the game.  If anyone has more info I'd certainly like to know about it.	-1
The good point is that the concept is not bad but the actual game is. Bad controls, glitches in the program, bugs make this game frustrating to play. Very disapointed with this game.	-1
Purchasing Gladius, I was under the impression I'd be getting an RPG based on Ancient Rome, dealing with building a Gladiator school and the likes.  First off, despite being called "Gladius" and dealing with Gladiators, it was completely ahistorical, with the brilliantly named "Empire of Imperia" apparently taking the place of Rome, and some generically "Naundark" or whatever named Barbarian kingdom perhaps taking the place of some Germanic tribes.  Aside from a ridiculously stupid storyline which takes liberally from every random generic magical fantasy story having to do with constellations of the bear's womb, the magic of the Gods, enchanted items and broad sweeping remarks by old people about "prophecies" and "destiny" and all that boring noise, the sentiments of Ursula's (one of the main character) brother mirrors much of the players' sentiments as well: "More talk... when are we going to get to some action?"  If you like Pokemon games for Gameboy, you'd likely love the battle system here.  It consists of taking very slow-to-pass turns walking on paths which render the field into a grid with big squares and limited movement.  Attacks consist of selecting the enemy, hitting "Strike", then playing a mini variant of something like "Mario Golf" with trying to hit a little bar right when it lands on red for a critical strike, or settling for the far larger part of the bar marked yellow.  This goes back and forth until someone wins.  This makes up the action combat of the game, while the background economics are a complex sort of deal that is difficult to keep track of in itself.  I had no idea I had only hired a gladiator for one battle, and couldn't even check on her until I started a battle to select my fighters.  This was a debacle of a game, and absolutely no fun at all unless you're willing to pay for a 3D highly stylized version of Pokemon...	-1
Hey really, how many basketball, football and baseball games are we going to have in the X-box format? If you haven't found one you like yet, try getting a REAL basketball and head down to the court for awhile. The electronic game industry really should get back to being innovative and lets explore some new venues. This stuff is really stale and I'm hard pressed to imagine who even buys it.	-1
In this game you play as Jen, a heavy metal girl who's boyfriend has been kidnapped and taken to the "demon realms".  Jen is taken to these realms by Scree, a gargoyle, and told that she must restore order to the realms in order to save her boyfriend.  There are four of these realms, and the graphics are very good, the environments are very creative, and there's a lot of exploring to do.  The first realm is mostly a forest at night, though there is also a city, coliseum, underground caverns, etc.  I didn't care for this realm too much, it's very maze-like and I spent the whole time having no idea where I was supposed to go or what I was supposed to do when I got there.  The second realm is underwater, and you'll spend the whole time swimming.  It's also very tough to navigate as you have to go from place to place and it's a big puzzle as far as how to get there.  At least the mission was straightforward, you have to achieve a number of objectives one after another.  The third realm was by far my favorite, you travel through an incredibly gloomy village and eventually wind up in a marvelous castle.  It was worth it for the scenery alone.  The fourth realm was so-so, it's a bunch of underground volcanic caverns and you'll spend a lot of time trying to get from one place to another.  The challenge in this level is fun though.  Probably the biggest problem with the game is the combat - it's the most basic button mashing imaginable.  Just press R2, over and over and over.  By the end of the final boss battle I though the middle finger on my right hand was going to fall off.  You basically get one weapon on each level and use it throughout, so there's absolutely no strategy when it comes to combat.  Though to be fair, in the third realm you could run away from your enemies, then get a powerup from your gargoyle pal, kill one enemy, get another powerup, repeat until they're all dead.  The story is another problem - you start out trying to save your boyfriend, but spend the whole game trying to restore order to the demon realms, which doesn't seem to have much to do with the original story setup, and left me feeling totally uninvolved.  They should have just ditched all the boyfriend stuff and instead come up with a different setup that would have made more sense and been more relevant.  Overall, good graphics and characters, lots of (often frustrating) exploring, and repetitive combat.  It's a pretty game and some portions of it are certainly quite fun to play, but overall the bad outweighs the good.	-1
The gameplay is the worst I have ever experienced. That is what totally ruins the game. I had to use the gamepad since there is no mouse control. And the reason why I purchased the game for the PC instead of the Playstation was to use the mouse. Anyway the control is terrible with the gamepad. The character does not point in the direction of the joystick movement, making it a pain to navigate. I made the mistake of purchasing this game based on reviews. I played this game for about 20 minutes before calling it quits.	-1
Folks, if you were going to purchase Primal to fill that adventure/exploration gap in your PS2 life, save your time and money.  While Primal did add some interesting twists on explorative/gothic gameplay, it still falls short of being a title worthy of hard earned cash.  Interesting and often beautiful environments are a plus here... but the figthing system is lame and repetitve, and the puzzles hardly merit mention.  There is no sense of addictive fun or excitement in Primal. - The stop and start brawls with easy-to-kill monsters gets old really fast.  This game is mostly comprised of clever cut-scenes and too much walking around. ...	-1
When I bought this game I was like cool its a game about a pirate controlling an island. Its got ok graphics. I never played the original Tropico so I couldn't tell you the differences. I played the game for about 5 hours. The only exciting part I found was sending the ships out to raid areas (when i played there was only one place to raid) Funny thing is they would never run out of people or be smart enought to move to another place (means not realistic). You would never see these raids. If you build too fast you would run out of captives. Very annoying. The whole fear thing on the captives doesn't mean anything. I never lost one captive. You could buy it or not its up to you!	-1
First off the good things. The game is very involved. Graphics are fantastic. Depth of game is second to none. OK, now the bad stuff. Lose the incessant chatter of the announcers. Its the same stuff every game. (Do you want to be reminded every game that Marquis Grissom's dad named him after a car he was working on?)Half of their babble about the play of the game is actually wrong. Secondly, AI needs major work. Runners will go with the pitch much too often, especially on short pop flies that you know will caught. Baserunning is near to impossible to control. I've had a situation occur several times where I end up with two runners on one base. Guess what? You can't make just one runner move. So they both go and there's a double(triple)play. I've played 14 games, using "easy" batting control on rookie mode. I've been no-hit 4 times and have homered once. The instruction manual is less than incomplete. It gives NO instructions on how to hit properly, field correctly, or run the bases. I've played HH2004. Its exactly the same as 2003, and I mean exactly, with the sole exception of updated rosters. But at least I can hit. I'll be playing High Heat from now on. I'll use the All-Star 2004 disk as a coaster for my beer. Acclaim should be ashamed of producing such a failure.	-1
Acclaims latest try at a baseball is nothing great or even average. The game had plenty of bonus features and special teams, cards etc. but misses on basic pieces to sports games that make them fun. Acclaim has always been somewhat of an overacheiver when it comes to games. They always seem to focus on one or two things and then miss the simple basic elements to a game that make them fun. The reason why many of us bought SNES and Genesis games when we were younger was not because they were realistic and full of features but because they were so basic that they were fun and exciting. SImply put ASB2004 is not exciting or fun, but becomes quite boring at times and makes you want to take it back to the store you got it from. There are plenty of other baseball games out there to fill your needs, this isn't one of them. ASB 2004 is weak in one particular area that bugs me. The gameplay. While the chracter faces are done very good. The bodies have no texture to them, abd the physics in the game are very much laughable at. Sometimes when a great diving catch was done you may see it in instant replay. However when you see it, the outfielder or infielder may be 5 feet from the ball but somehow someway they are able to rob you of a great bloop single or a supposed to be double. This bothered me alot. It seemed like every hit i got was robbed from me and in a split second I could find myself looking at no hitter in favor of the cpu. Another bad thing about the game is the franchise mode can be a little annoying. Lets say you happen to lose a player to an injury and you want to add a minor leauger onto the roster. It can be very tiring just to add a minor leauger onto your team. Not to mention the fact that you have to add a new free agent to your team. Now this all may seem easy but trust me it's not. You will constantly be told that you have one too many player on the 40 man roster. You take that free agent off the team and now you have one too many! Ugh this got me mad enough to turn off my ps2 and go play something else. The only way to avoid this is taking injuries off or letting the cpu do it for you. Unfortuantley if ou let the cpu do it for you they most likely will change up the roster. Like if you had an AL team with a DH the DH may be changed because hes not hitting as well as a bench warmer when in reality you want the bad DH to hit so he can get experience. Or if you have 2 good 2nd basemen one lefty, one righty you may want to have the lefty to go up against right handed pitchers and the rightys vice-versa. All of this can be changed if you let cpu do things for you. It becomes very tiring and very boring at times. Even though ASB 2004 has its annoying moments it does shine at times. The commentary is done well, there aren't alot of repeats whisch is great. The special features are also excellent, there's plenty to do (it'd be even better if the gameplay was better but oh well) if you don't feel like playing a whole game or going into franchise mode. Sceanario mode is very good giving you actual games to change like a game where Piazza went 0-4 and his mets lost after being in a 4-4 tie, change that by getting the mets a win. All in all ASB 2004 is very much worth a rent but not a buy. Try it out though (especially those who have been into the franchise for a long time.) It's not exactly a bad game just  game that needs alot of tweaking.	-1
After buying nearly every BB game on PS2 in 2001/2002 i was impressed with Acklaim ALLStarBaseball , ASB2002 was good, ASB2003 was great so of course i bought ASB2004. How dissapointed i was. The players don't look lifelike (cartoony) infact this aspect has gone backwards. The fielding is off the mark and overall things just don't "feel" right, batting, pitching and baserunning are weaker than previous versions. Im into the whole Management side anyhow, and was impressed with the concept more than the end result. Very indepth but poorly presented. With old fashioned style screens, handwritten fonts that cant be read(and i own a 46" TV), i was dissapointed. And if you don't understand the Rule 5 Draft don't switch on FULL management mode. Things seemed a little slow and it had a PC feel more than a console game, especially in Manage Mode. If you have ASB 2003 , keep it, its the best of this series. If you want what is the best baseball game on console, get EA Sports MVP2003, it rocks (check out my review of that game).	-1
Whew, what can I say? This is the first Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG),  to be on any home console and I have to say it is one of the worst out there. As with any other MMORPG you create an account and pay your monthly fee. Next you create a character and log into the huge massive world. Perhaps the massive world is the only thing I liked about this game, as it was always a pure joy to just walk around and seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldy go where no other Everquest nerd has gone before! Honestly though I did find it fun and enjoyable to walk around the world. Anway, once you make your character you do missions or "quests" in which you complete tasks and are awarded Experience Points (XP). XP points get your character levles. Once each new level is obtained, it takes more XP to get to the next one. The advantage of getting to a higher level is that you can: 1. Wear new armor, get new weapons, kill bigger animals, and do new and repetitive quests. The max level you can obtain is 50, and to give you an idea of how long this will take to obtain Sony says the following: 500-600 hours! WOW! I can tell you for a fact that it will take around 1,000 hours for most people. In order to get that valuable XP you have to kill animals and fantasy monsters. You do so by endlessly typing into your USB Keyboard (NEEDED ITEM!) asking for a group. Once in your group, you walk to an area to kill go kill these monsters. You kill monsters by pressing the X button. Each monster takes about 20 button presses. It takes about 500 kills to level up. To most sane people this is just too much. To top it off, if you cannot find a group, you cannot kill these animals and so the game becomes usless if there isn't anyone else playing. This game becomes very, very, very, stressful in the later levels, which is why I canceled my account just days ago. As icing on the cake, the game graphics are very poor. I do not recomend this game at all. Graphics: 1/10 Sound: 1/10 (Hardly any sound at all) Replayibility: 10/10 Online: Yes (Only online) Multiplayer: No	-1
Ok folks. Listen up. This is a hardcore PC gamer talking to ya: I have been playing EverQuest for about three years on the PC. It's a great game and still has newcomers and serrious players that join in the fun. I personally am not a huge gamer, so i don't spend THAT much time on stuff like that, however I know a good game when I see one. I harassed my friend for ages when he first bought the PS2 version of the game, and then I went over to check it out for myself. Most of what I found was devestating. They've had, what... four or five years to make the graphics BETTER for this game, the worlds MORE expansive, the connection compatability better, yet all they do is an immitation of an otherwise great PC game! Face it, EQ is four or five years old! During that time span, they could have DEFINATELY improved the game instead of using the same engine and making different quests. If you own the PC version, shun this game forever... Most console gamers probably wouldn't enjoy a game like this, anyway.	-1
how else can i put it?  it just sucks.  of course if you want to find out for yourself, feel free to play it and you'll probably feel the same way.	-1
For starters, this is my brother's game, but I tried it out for like, fifteen minutes, before I got so bored I turned it off. This game is a pointless shoot 'em up where all you do is run around shooting this or sawing that. It's entertaining for a little bit watching the zombies fall apart at the hands(or blades) of Ash's chainsaw. But it's only a matter of time before the gameplay becomes so redundant you have no will to continue playing because all you do is chop stuff up(and what's with the strip clubs everywhere?!).There ARE spells that attempt to add some depth to the game, but when the day is over, you're left with the same shoot and slash garbage you started with when you turned the game on. Anyone into these kind of games should check out the Hunter games instead. They have better variation in weapons, and you can play with a friend. I would not recommend this game to ANYONE unless they're a die hard fan of the Evil Dead series.	-1
Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick is nice looking game, with some great lighting effects and extra touches like leaves blowing in the wind.  Downside.. it's really, really dark. Bruce Campbell voices Ash's dialog, which should please fans of the Evil Dead movies. This game is boring, so boring that it's hard to play long enough to get to some of the game's more interesting elements like the selection of different weapons or the ability to cast a few spells. If you want to play this game, I suggest renting it first.  Shooting and slashing zombies can be fun, but after a while it gets really boring.	-1
Before actually playing it, I was planning on buying it anyways, because of all the good reviews it had gotten, but thank God I played it at a store because it really didn't please me at all.  In the stealth-action genre, no game, and I mean no game at all, can even come remotely close to the entertainment that the Metal Gear Solid series provides.  The gameplay in Splinter Cell is quite unique, but there are weird things that you have to do like when you pick locks, you may be stumped, sitting there for 30 minutes trying to figure out how to pick the thing. To say I've seen better does not do my feelings justice.  In fact, I think that I'll go dig out my copy of Metal Gear Solid (the first one!)	-1
I was looking forward to this game.  I absolutely loved Lords of the Realm 2.  I can pick it up and even play it today and enjoy it greatly.  Part 3 however is awful.  All of the fun parts of 2 are gone.  The battles are boring, and the graphics are really dated.  The game is full of bugs and is just not fun to play.  Playing the game once feels repetative.  This game has no replay value at all.	-1
I didn't believe the awful reviews this game recieved.  Unfortunately I just wasted 20 dollars. Please DO NOT BUY this game.  It really irks me that other people will waste their money on this title.  The gameplay is incredibly slow.  It is sometimes impossible to beat the AI because of the slow speed and endless battles.  The game has features worse than titles from the 90s.  One of the absolutely worst I have ever played.  I can hardly express how truly terrible this game is.	-1
This is unbelievable. All the great things about the Lords of the Realm II have been removed and nothing good has been added.  Gone is the management of the territory resources, instead you simply assign a vassal to an area and they produce just one type of resources.  To make matters worse, you armies are produced automatically so you don't even get to choose your army types.  The battles start automatically but you are not even taken to the battlefield automatically so you can ened up missing the battle if you don't go there right away.  I read the other reviews but I thought the sencond one was such fun I should give this one a try.  Big mistake  save your money.	-1
After a LONG wait and much excitment, Lords of the Realm III did NOT live up to the hype.  It has none of the personality that II did, and is a shabby game over all.  It certainly doesn't compare to Medieval Total War.  Skip it completely, save your money, and buy a copy of Medieval instead.  MUCH better game.	-1
This game was on my top 10 wish list for games I wanted. I could not wait for it to come out. Now that I have it, how dissappointing it was. When I first got Lords of the Realms 2, I played it the first day for 15 staight hours. It was my first taste of real time strategy and started my conversion from puzzle games to RTS and FPS games. With Realms 3, it took all of the good things from Realms 2 and got rid of them. You can no longer control the resources you collect like rock, trees, and your food. You now place a vassal on a vacant plot and you get either gold or food. Thats it. You also can't raise an army. The only way you can get an army is to place a Knight on a vacant plot or buy mercanaries. But if you don't own enough land, you can only have so many Knights or you will not have enough money or farms. If you are short on farms, your army will abandon you. The longer your Knight is on the board, the more men he will collect, but it takes a very long time to collect a very small amount of men. You used to be able to control your lands easier and make your city grow, then raise an army. But not now. The most irritating thing is fighting. If you go to an enemies lands and take out his farm, if you don't leave an army back, they will instantly place another vassal for a farm. Even if you take out their castle, you still can't take over their land until you do more damage to their land. The next irritating thing is the armies. You can kill all of the enemies armies which leaves his plot open. He will then place another Knight to replace his beaten Knight and then attack you and somehow he has an army twice your size. I beat one enemies Knights completely 3 straight times and he still came back with 2 large armies and force me from his land. Not sure how that happened as I went through every Knight of the Realm and never found a large army once. When an army takes damage, their color changes. When they get to red, they are discouraged and they disband during the fight. So how he can keep coming back is beyond me becasue your army needs time to heal. And the last irritating thing is the battles. It seems like every time I go to the battle screen, another army attacks my lands. That is because there is no pause in the game when try to fight the battles yourself. If you let the computer do it for you, you lose alot more than you should plus you don't get to play the game. There needs to be a pause during battles so you can enjoy the game more. You also can't build siege weapons. You have buy siege mercanaries. Not cooll at all. The games doesn't totally suck. It is challenging (although very repititious) and the graphics are pretty good (although I haven't been able to see the intro movie or any other cutscenes even thought I downloaded the patch. not sure whats up with that), but that is about it. If they plan on making another, they better go back to what worked for Realms 2 & 3 and incorporate it in Realms 4, otherwise this franchise is dead if it isn't already.	-1
As reflected in other reviews here, Sierra took out all the best parts of this series: managing the economy, delicate balancing of army, and even basic interaction with your cities.  They took out the castle choices and the cool little videos.  Even though the battle graphics were pretty basic in the prior games, it was unquestionably more engaging than the 3-D graphics but dull and incomprehensible battles in this game.  In addition to the inability to control individual troops, I have had fighters attacking the air and other clipping issues. This game is simply not fun, and made me want to fire up Lords II to remember what this series used to be about. Get Stronghold or Lords II for a much better game.	-1
I've been with this series since the beginning. The first one rocked, the lands were huge you got to do so much stuff. The second one blew, you played on itty bitty lands and it blew. So I figured that the 3rd would be a return to the first, man was I wrong it was like the 2nd but more land, but as a price taking care of your towns was gone, you just threw servant down on a land and boom your done, what the hell, then to top it off when you attack ajacent lands you can basically destroy the crap out of it but you can't take control of it, that's not cool. The only reason why I give it a star is because I like the graphics in the battle screens, but other than that this game belongs in a bargain bin, and the places that have it should pay you to pick it up.	-1
I bought this game one month ago, together with "American Conquest Fight Back", if I liked the last one as top of the bunch, LOTR III is bottom. I'll try to sell my copy, and desperately look for an used copy of the first version.	-1
I was happy to see LORII was being made when it was first announced way back in 2001.  As soon as I heard the developers were going to defect to the RTS craze, I knew it was a lost cause.  There has been more RTS crap churned out than ever before..RTS SUCKS because you don't have time to strategize.  It's the same old boring repetitive crap.  Yet developers keep making the same garbage. LORIII was supposed to be realized in christmas of 2002, then spring 2003, then winter 2003, ugg, I can't remember how many times it was delayed.  You can tell the project must have been in total chaos. Word to the game developers...try making a game that actually requires thought and strategy.	-1
I don't know what is going on.  I wrote a review for this game yesterday and checked to see if it was up today and there are now zero reviews!  There were about 2 dozen 1-star reviews and a smattering of 4-5 star reviews from ppl who hadn't played the game yet but were sure it would rock.  Amazon are you caving to vendors now? Anyway, here is my review...again. This game is a complete ripoff.  LOTR2 is one of my favorite games of all time; if it ran on win2k I'd still play it (tip: it runs on XP in compatibility mode).  LOTR3 is nothing like it.  In fact they seemed to take everything good about LOTR2 out and replace it with ... nothing.  Specifics: 1) Terrible documentation!!!  The booklet that came with the game is completely insufficient and online/on cd docs are almost identical to the printed one.  This is a recurring theme in my review.  You are basically sitting there looking at stuff you can't click on wondering what to do. 2) All micro-management of resources is gone.  You assign a peasant to a parcel of land and then ignore it completely as he makes food automatically.  Same goes for soldiers and money.  No ability to change what type of soldiers or food.  Or maybe there is but there is NO DOCUMENTATION!!! 3) You can't conquer pieces or territory anymore.  You can only devastate them and you have to take out the main castle and then you get all of the territories at once.  This took a large part of the strategy out of the game. 4) Hiring mercs is a gamble because you only see their title like "siege engineer" and a tiny piece of info, which didn't include the cost of hiring them.  Maybe there is a way to find this info, but there is NO DOCUMENTATION!!! 5) You can't upgrade the castles except in your main province.  Read that line again.  They took out one of the most fun aspects. 6) Upgrading your main castle is a crap shoot since you have the option to downgrade, but still pay money to do so.  So you have a level 5 castle and can buy and build a level 2 castle thinking you are getting an upgrade.  The in-game descriptions of the castles consist of the castle name (ie "strong stone castle") and a really small picture - nothing else.  NO DOCUMENTATION!!! 7) You upgrade castles by saving money and buying the upgrade.  After about 30 real-world minutes of saving someone steals my money every time.  I have no idea how or how to stop them because there is ... (boy I'm getting tired of typing this) NO DOCUMENTATION. 8) During battle scenes you can't zoom in or out which makes it difficult to manuever your forces or even tell what troop types you are facing.  The graphics are not that good despite being *very* hardware intensive (more on that coming up). 9) The graphics are *very* hardware intensive (told ya ;-)).  "Recommended" specs are 1.5GHz, 256RAM and if you use ATI, a Radeon 8500 or later.  I have a 2200+ CPU (clock speed ~1800MHz), 512MB DDR 400 RAM, and a Radeon 9700 Pro.  During sieges I got to watch arrows fly at my troops *frame-by-frame*.  That was with 2 enemy units vs 3-5 of mine, not a massive battle at all. 10) After allying myself with another county I accidentally clicked on that county while controlling my army.  I was automatically at war despite being 2 counties away and immediately clicking somewhere else.  Lame. 11) Sieges.  The crowning achievement of LOTR2.  They suck in LOTR3.  Instead of attacking the front of a castle where the defenders are massed, I went around the side.  The defenders didn't reposition themselves.  So I climb the walls, get all my guys on top of the wall and they ... mill around randomly.  They almost completely ignore my commands, and the worst part... I CAN'T TARGET THE DEFENDERS!  So I sit there gaping while 2-3 archers (not 2-3 units of archers) mow down my 3 units who are standing right next to them.  I repeated this experiment several times with same results. 12) Attacking an army on the field is lame.  If you set up two units to attack one unit from different angles, both your units just bee-line right for the center of the enemy unit anyway.  Not anything like the cool tricks you could play with the Total War series.  No usage of terrain or weather or anything. Summary: This game is actually *less advanced* than LOTR2 in a lot of ways.  The only advancement I saw was in graphics, which were sub-standard anyway.  If you cherish LOTR2 like I do, AVOID THIS GAME! As for you amazon.com, I check my reviews periodically.  I'm saving this one in a text file and I will upload it as needed from different accounts and IPs if you erase it again.	-1
I pre-ordered this game the day it was posted based on how much fun Lords Of The Realm 2 was.  Unfortunately, everything that made LOTR2 fun wasn't in here.  The territory values, the farming, the battle sounds...all gone.  The siege system is laughable, and the AI for both your own unit movements and the enemy movements are terrible. Now I know why the price was $19.99...not worth it.	-1
If I could have give it negative stars I would have. Expecting an upgrade to Lords of the Realm II, what I/we got was a totally different game. IT's an RTS POS. Gone is all the fun of turn based micromanaging and playstyle. All that is left is what the Siege Pak of LOTR II gave us, battle battle battle, boring. There's lots better RTS games out there, heck you can get EMIRES DAWN of the MODERN WORLD for less than $20 on ebay now and it's 1000x better than this game. No demo, and I surely can see why, nobody would have bought it, except a few clicky babies maybe. I'm glad I had a seven day return policy, I only needed ONE though! This isn't even worth bargain bin $5 to me. I have too many GREAT RTS games than to play this. Heck MTW (Medieval Total War) is better. It's $20 or less also on ebay and probably here at Amazon.com also. This one's a dud. It's so much of a dud they won't let you say anything bad about it over at the official website forums. If you think I'm kidding go try. ;)	-1
LOTR2 was a classic game. LOTR3 should have expanded on the things that made LOTR2 good, but strangely removes all the interesting bits in managing your lands, and leaves you with kind of a weaker version of a "Total War" title. Everything happens in real time, which means armies *crawl* across the global map far to slowly. This would have been better handled as a turn based element. Not fun. Individual parcels of land don't seem to be anymore valuable than any other parecls of land. You don't seem to get invovled into that "damn I really need that mine/deposit/wood". No choke points on the maps either. Not fun. Actual battles are frenzied, quick, and extremely hard to control. Calvary types can get arcoss the battle maps faster than I can even select my troops and get them into some sort of logical order. Not fun. There are many possible formations and stances for individual troops, but no logical formations for groupings of more than one troop type. I.e. if you select a troop of archers and a troop of pikemen for instance and tell them to march to a location, they march off as if the others didn't exist.  That means the faster moving archers arrive first and get wasted by melee types, then the pikes arrive, who engage the enemy melee types, but get mowed down by the enemy archers. Lightly armored ranged troops should fall in behind melee troops. Other games have been doing this for years now. Whats the problem? Not fun. Not too much point trying flanking with calvary either. The lighter faster troops arrive first, so you may as well just plough straight into them. My battle tactics have simply been to pause the game, select all troops, and direct them all to attack en mass at the center of the enemies ranks. Mindless. Not fun. Attacking castles is painful. You can't seige them as in LOTR2, you just attack with your current troops straight away. Troops scale the walls etc, but this combat seems buggy and confusing. Units appear to get get trapped up on the walls, and no quick capture the flag to end battles. LOTR2 is *much* better in this aspect. No skirmish mode. Yep. NO SKIRMISH MODE. Not fun. I'd suggest looking around for "Kohan Immortal Sovereigns", or a "Total War" game over this one.	-1
The graphics are improved, the engine is improved, the game play sucks.  No longer are you thinking about what to build, how to maneuver your formations and where to have them focus.  This is bigger picture, and I honestly think it takes most of the fun away from the old one.  If they only improved the originals graphics and added a few more ships and another great story.  This story is terrible, and almost non existent.  No book breaking down everything for you like the original had, no feeling of discovery, and none of the personal attachment or feeling of control you felt in the first one.  Formations have been replaced with types of doctrinalish tasks like Frigate Screen.  Instead of building your own formations out of whatever you liked and moving it how and where you liked, now you build fleets you have little control over.  Not gratifying.  You don't build individual units like you did in the first one, except on the frigate and above level.  Now you build little wings of 3 or so that do your bidding.  The worst thing they screwed up was the research.  No longer do you research for you fleet in general, now every ship must have a research facility installed on its actual superstructure (read: money invested in worthless technology you already own on another vessel to move on to the next stage...).  Lots of money spent on the R&D.  Nothing was simple about this game, and Sierra let us all down.  Great ideas like upgrades and disabling specific portions of enemy capital ships sound great in theory, but fail to turn into fun once the gaming starts.  If you never played the first one, maybe this will be satisfying, but I have my doubts.  Look elsewhere.  If you enjoyed the first one, don't bother with this one, look elsewhere.  Or stick with the original.  Think of it like the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies that you wish never existed.	-1
I'm not an expert of Homeworld series, I've never played any of the games other than this one, and I know nothing about the storyline.  The intro video for Homeworld 2 really told me nothing more than these people called Hiigarans have found these things called "Cores", which an evil man wants for himself, and so he attacks and destroys many colonies of the Hiigarans because they won't give them up.  I wish I could tell more, but that is literally all that the intro movie tells you.  Leaving it to more Homeworld-literate and informed reviewers to point out the flaws more in-depth, I'll simply tell from my point of view.  The User Interface is an utter mess of details and menus and submenus and obscurely shaped objects without labels that you have to figure out what they do by clicking them.  It's incredibly difficult to deal with, and you have to figure out what the wire-frames of each individual ship is, otherwise you'll never figure out what ships you've selected in space, because they aren't labeled unless you hover your mouse over them.  The gameplay is terribly uninvolving.  Due to the clunky controls, sight is a luxury not well spent on your own forces.  Scrolling tends to go either too far in or too far away.  You're either watching the ships too closely, or so far away you can't tell what they're doing.  Another irritating feature is in cases of emergency, when you have to rush your ships over to enemies, is that you must click for them to attack the enemy as they zip past, because if you miss, your cursor will get stuck in a two-dimensional movement circle which essentially forces you to move the ship somewhere on its same plane in only two dimensions.  Pressing escape resolves this, but it's still a severe deterrent in emergency situations.  The tutorial goes from baby-easy, to completely batnuts insanely difficult, as you go from one mission where you fight off a few enemy bombers pestering your Mothership, to fending off meager attacks on your transports, to suddenly encountering a fleet of several frigates, dozens and dozens and dozens of fighters and bombers, and only seconds after you're supposed to destroy the enemy half the map away in a resource field.  As the final sampling, the voice acting.  Aside from the female voice of the Hiigaran leader, it seems they only hired one man to do the voices for all the ships and characters.  And he does all of them in the exact same voice, lazy and monotone, even when his characters are about to die, sacrificing themselves to save you.  All in all, I couldn't believe how intolerably flawed this game was.  It's just plain... bad.  I've never played any of the other Homeworld games, but I hope the first is better than this one.	-1
I bought this game for my xbox and I put it in the xbox and it didn't work. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone and I Will never buy anything from this seller again	-1
I really can not believe the 5 star reviews for this game.  I can only assume that it gets an extra 3 automatically for being the sequel to the "1999 Game of the Year" (as Sierra is so fond of advertising). I'm a big fan of the Homeworld series and enjoyed the two previous installments greatly, so needless to say I was quite looking forward to cracking open HW2.  The demo wasn't exactly inspiring, I wasn't really fond of some of the modifications that were made to the game's basic formula.  Namely the inclusion of unit "squadrons" and a more emphasised "paper-rock-scissors" balance scheme.  Even so, I managed to talk myself into shelling out 40 bucks for the game... d'oh! Despite all the "its too hard!" comments floating around, I was undaunted, I don't mind a challenge.  Unfortunately, the challenge in HW2 is afforded mostly by a test of how fast you can click your mouse and navigate around the (nicely updated) interface.  A typical campaign mission in HW2 consists mostly of you constantly trying to repel a ceaseless barrage of enemy ships... while trying to complete both your mission goals, AND without sucking up every single resource unit on the map before you get there. I'm giving it 3 stars, for the following things:  Graphics, Sound, Design, and an at least moderately fun Skirmish mode.  Everything else, in my humble opinion, is just nonexistant.  I shudder to think how well a newcommer would fare in HW2, I consider myself a pretty decent RTS gamer and I still find it a frustrating experience. Not to mention, there is only a single campaign, rather than one for each faction... I hope this doesn't become the next RTS trend. In short, HW2 has everything going for it except what matters - gameplay.  I play games to relax and enjoy, not to be irritated and driven out of my mind.  Very disappointed, I hope Relic lets Barking Dog Studios (who did HW: Cataclysm) handle the next installment of this series.	-1
I bought this game the day it came out i think, i played it for a while that day, and stopped playing it for about a month.  Just today i started playing it again, and i remembered why i stopped playing. I guess the biggest flaw is this game is HARD.  For some reason it seems that pc games only have two settings these days: easy and impossibly hard.  This game is definatly the latter. The units in this game are evolved around the old silly theory that one unit is strong versus an other type of unit, but completly helpless against some other type.  Which always seemed rather stupid to me.  A .50 m2 machine gun was designed to be an anti-vehicle weapon.  Does that mean it's completly useless against personnel?  Uh no...it just happens that it's MORE effective against personnel, because of its obvious over-powerment. So In the game you have to figure out what the enemy's strengths and weaknesses are, and exploit them with the appropriate unit.  However...the enemy rarely has just one type of unit, in fact it usually has a pretty well rounded force.  So you have to create a well rounded force yourself to deal with them.  However the enemy is much faster than you, and can pick and chose your ships while you're trying to make sense of the battle.  It amazes me every time how surgical the ai is when it comes to wiping out your force.  You'll have a large, well rounded group one second, then notice the enemy is targeting solely one type of unit of yours.  Once that unit type is gone, you're force is essentially crippled as it now has a large hole in it that can be easily exploited.  It amazes me how the enemy can target those single unit types in a group of 50 other ships, when you can barely even SEE what types of units are in their groups. Add this to the fact that the enemy also has unlimited recources and ships, and you have a rather frustrating puzzle. Every mistake you make is cumulative as well.  You cant just barely win a battle.  As you'll go into the next battle with basically no units.  You always have to find a way to win the battle without crippling your chances for the next battle. The battle really does not give you much time to think either.  You have a research capability to improve your units...but you're rarely given a single uneventfull minute to figure out what you want to research. The graphics in this game are pretty stunning...i guess.  I run a high end computer (2.6 p4, 1 gig ddr ram, geforce ti 4600 128 mb ddr ram) and the graphics are still EXTREMELY choppy in parts. It's ok if you zoom all the way out, but if you zoom close into the ships everything becomes choppy and the game slows down significantly. The story completly escapes me.  I read the little overview of the story in the manual, and i still have no idea what the game is talking about.  I never played the original homeworlds, so sue me. Overall...it's just another game i have around that takes up space.	-1
While a lot of effort was put into this game's graphics, stop-motion animation and story the game play is very dull. Cars are slow.  The fighting controls are weak.  Even civilian AI is screwed; they kept driving through the streets like normal despite the fact that a massive gun fight was happening.  Overall it just wasn't fun.	-1
Half of the time your A STUPID TAXI DRIVER  CARS ARE REALLY SLOW LIMITID WEAPONS LOAD TIMES ARE SLOW A WERY BAD GAME	-1
I loved the show,so I got the game. It is funny for awhile,but the same moves and one-liners quickly wear on your nerves. The game ends very quick,but what's really bad about this game is  the so called unlockable "bonus" characters to play as! I was under the impression that you would unlock more celebs to play as;that is NOT the case at all. You just unlock stupid fantasy characters like frankenstien,werewolf,mummy,alien etc. Also the material they used to poke fun at the celebrities seems dated,as if this game was meant to be released a couple years back. Gotham Games could've also added better celebrities to play as and mutilate. I think it would've been funny to see someone like Brittney Spears or Eminem getting impaled or beheaded. But instead they give us Busta Rhymes and Carrot Top!? Take this one for a rental if you are really bored,but PLEASE do not buy this one!	-1
wasn't interested	-1
Defective game does not function not work properly no picture, not as described by Seller. Refund pending	-1
I don't know why but I've gotten 2 of these things now (both used) and neither had the ability to hold onto a save file after the first 5 seconds of gameplay. I'm going to half to save my money and get a new copy for over $100 if I ever want to play it.	-1
This product was a waste of my money as it did not work properly. It deleted my saved data all on its own. I am not happy about it.	-1
This game is horrible. Im basing this off of actual gameplay. Since I am anbiased gamer, I can say that this game series needs to end! The creators think that adding new PokeMon will save the series! Well it can not and will not. Adding new Pokemon, and a few new perks just is getting boring. Also there is basicly no stradegy whatso ever! Its like the stronger of the two will win, and nothing else. Its sooo boring looking for people to battle and just walking around getting badges is old too!!	-1
Enough with the Pokemon stuff already.  It's a fad that died out a few years ago, yet Nintendo's making a sequel with some of the most dated graphics I've ever seen.  The series hopes to get young kids into the RPG genre, which is fine, but for them to keep at it this long is abseloutely pathetic.  They should have scrapped this project and focused on the new Golden Sun game, an RPG series that's actualy GOOD and requires DEEP THOUGHT.  I doubt anyone over 10 is playing pokemon anymore.  But those who are should try to expand their intrests.  Maybe try a "T" rated RPG and see how much more comlex and interesting it can be.	-1
this is obviously fake. For one thing, it says "GamGameGame" not "GameboyAdvance". It's also missing the nintendo logo. Please save yourself from buying this. I will say though, whoever is selling this got the fonts right, something apparently very hard to do	-1
Received a fake cartridge from VideoGaming4U, so... Ya know yay.	-1
I'm not a big fan, it's too childish and the graphics draw distance is all fuzzy and looks bad. It's very immature game and I rather the old Nintendo version	-1
Ruby really disappoints me. The game is boring and has NO replay value. Don't get me wrong; Leaf Green was SO much better than this. You'd probably have more fun playing the other games, just skip this, you won't be missing out on much.	-1
This game is boring. You can onlty expoler Hoen and there's not a lot of Pokemon form the other games. You can't connect to the other games and after the elite foure thres nothing for you to do except cath all the pokemon. You can't even travel to fight people in Jhoto and Kanto. Thats why I liked Gold and Sliver but this is stupid. You still have to make due with only Four moves not six or five, but only four moves. and some of the new pokemon is ugly and even some look alike. Also in the Pelterbug forrest cath two Slakouth because you can trade one for a pokemon I can't pronounce in Peltaburg city. In Peltaburg city you have to fight roxanne. She has a Lv. 15 Geodude and LV.14 Nosepass. Nosepass uses a attacked call Rock to mp it reduces your ablie and doese Damage!!! Use berries if you have them. If you have Treecko there is a guy in route 104 that gives a TM called Bullet Seed. teach that TM to Treecko. Bullet Seed is a Grass move that attacks 2 -5 times. It doese crital damage to Rock and fighting pokemon. If you don't have Treccko, another good poke for the gym leader is Dustox. Level up a wrumple to lv. 10 and learn confusion. and Gust at lv. 13. At slateport, if you defeat all the trainers in the shack you get six Sodapop!!!	-1
The greatest bait and switch betrayal of a fanbase in videogaming history and most hated game of all time.  To begin I will provide Amazon's customer base the "tale of the turd" as I call it in relation to this abomination's "quality" or rather lackthereof:  Gameplay: Utterly challengeless. A lobotomy patient, a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort. Just mash buttons or "spam" the controls as PC gamers would say and you'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.  Graphics: Hideous, vomit inducing, ridiculous, teletubbies-esque, bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 (realistic style epic, cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release. Oh what a shame.  Sound: The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo. The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel. Soccer moms and grandparents should approve. Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.  Theme: Near total rip off of Kevin Costner's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired. Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game. No, what we're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper, not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker. I've said it before and I'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.  Commentary: The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda: Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.  This was Nintendo, Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma's Vince Mcmahon esque "Screw you!" to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.  Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series, this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.  To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott's Gladiator: "Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it, THIS IS NOT IT!"  We were lied to and led to believe that the epic, cool, badass, Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo's way (before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they haven't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda's true fans.  Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora's Mask.  Aonuma's first game "Marvelous" failed (MARVELOUSLY!) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he's been driving Zelda along with it's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.  When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.  Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.  In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more: Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient (as is typical of Aonuma offerings).  Conclusion: My rating of this turd is 1 star since I can't give it lower due to how Amazon's system is set up.	-1
Pokmon has come a long way to here, but it's losing its touch. In 1995, a popular trading card game was brought to America from Japan.  It wasn't until 1998 a game for Gameboy was released, a game similar to the trading card game, become the greatest Pokmon master ever.  Soon 1999 was here, and to go along with Red and Blue, Yellow.  Then later on down the road in the new era of the 21st century, 2000 and 2001 came Gold, Silver, and Crystal.  The storyline was exactly the same as before, with wierd twists.  Now, we have Ruby and Sapphire.  IT'S THE SAME!!!!!!!  Don't waste your money.	-1

I had loved the Zelda series, but was dismayed when I saw Wind Waker. The cartoonish graphics look childish and amateurish. I nonetheless decided to rent the game and give it a shot. However, I gave up after a half hour or so. It just wasn't fun and wasn't worth my time.	-1
Reading some of the reviews posted before, I got the feeling a number of these reviewers didn't actually finish the game. I agree with them completely about the first half of it, it's fun, it's pretty. The graphics, control system, and gameplay are all very good. And for the beginning, the story is excellent.   Where I disagree is in the rest of it. The second half of the game involves amazing amounts of guesswork, and very little encouragement, making the game lose most all of it's wonderful momentum. I started out overjoyed and having fun, then it all drained away.   Every time I started really enjoying myself - in a fight, a jumping puzzle, a dungeon crawl, I ran into something that just got in the way of it. Most often, it would be something that was tricky to figure out, and then you get that proud feeling when you do, but then doing what you figured out proved tedious and aggravating. I was ok with the sailing, I liked the graphics, I liked the story, and I liked the controls; but this game was designed in large part by a sadist. I've heard reviewers say it was easy, a lot of it is, but the parts that aren't are not difficult because the puzzles are complicated, they're just designed to be just hard enough that knowing what you have to do was less than half the battle.   I've played every Zelda game made, they've all had nasty tricky puzzles, but this is the first one where the puzzles are harder to complete than to figure out. Last time I checked, the point of a puzzle was solving it, not writing down the solution.   The story is all right, most notably because it is different from every other Zelda game made before. The unique flavor adds a lot to it, but the story remains pretty sparse considering the amount of leg-work between plot moments.   I have to say, having played through the entire game and gotten through every side quest, that it's good aspects are seriously hurt by it's overly irritating nature.   (Plus, one of the characters you have to rely on very heavily not only empties your purse, but is just damned obnoxious, good old pal Tingle!)	-1
Think back the fall of 1999 when "The Blair Witch Project" was released.  The elitist movie critics were in a full-fledged campaign to convince the public and themselves that the movie was the best thing since "Citizen Kane".  Back in 1999 so much praise was showered on the film that the voices of dissent were drowned out and ridiculed.  Then a funny thing happened: time passed.  Like the rest of the superficial Hollywood crowd, the elitist critics have moved on and this has allowed people to freely rethink the movie.  Now it's hard to find anyone who's filling to admit they liked the "Blair Witch Project".  Why do I mention that?  Because the story's nearly the same when it comes to the near universal praise of Nintendo's "Wind Waker" game.  Since "Wind Waker" is a Zelda game, and since the Zelda franchise is amazing, the "Wind Waker" must be amazing too, right?  Right? Unfortunately, no, but equally disturbing is how the gaming community answered "yes" to that question.  They went into a full-fledged campaign to convince themselves, and the public, that this game deserved a pedestal next to "Link to the Past" and "Ocarina of Time".  Only now, years after its release, do I hear consistent complaints about the game.  Below is a list of problems with the game:  1) The sailing aspect of the game takes up at least 50% of the adventure and it is extremely tedious.  Nintendo didn't even attempt to streamline this process.  You can literally set your direction, put the controller on the floor, and sit back and watch the minutes pass as Link sails along to your destination.  In order to further extend the playtime of sailing, the user is forced to embark on numerous mini-quests where many must be performed numerous times through the game.  The most annoying are the "fetch quests" where you dredge the ocean floor for items.  *Yawn* Are we having fun yet?  2) The game consists of only a few dungeons, and some of them are extremely easy.  Important aspects of the game were replaced with time-consuming fetch quests from the ship.  3) The game has an unexploited storyline.  I can think of numerous examples of storyline elements that seem like they should conclude in something big, but completely fizzle out.  (Between this and the lack of dungeons, I am convinced this game was rushed to market)  4) I might as well say it: the graphics are terrible but otherwise fit the overall-quality of the game.  The Link model is the worst: a massive head, massive eyes, and eyebrows that somehow float over his hair.  At least you spend most of your time staring at the back of Link's head.  5) Before release we were told that the NPC (non playable characters) were going to be far more advanced than others we've seen in the past.  I have no idea where Nintendo got off promoting that idea because they are identical in sophistication to those in OoT and just about every video game I've played.  They certainly aren't as interesting as those from Majora's Mask.  6) And I've just grown tired of games where you must constantly switch between the game and an item selection submenu.  Metroid didn't need this and neither did Star Fox Adventures.  I'd love to see Nintendo incorporate something that would minimize this behavior in their Zelda games.  The problem is especially bad in The Wind Waker because an entire item slot is wasted on the sail.  7) Fighting non-boss enemies is extremely easy.  Just Z-target and swing your sword for a few moments and the green A button icon will change to a green star and flash.  Press the button when this happens and Link does an incredible feat of acrobatics and destroys his foe.  It looks awesome, but you quickly learn that this ability makes it extremely easy to fight nearly anything.  It also makes the game feel like its playing on autopilot and you are just a bystander watching.  So this is a review for those interested in Twilight Princess.  Whether your itching for a Zelda fix while waiting for TP or have played and enjoyed TP and want more Zelda, I've just gotta warn you that Wind Waker is not worth the trouble.	-1
Unlike a lot of people, the new look of Link in Wind Waker didn't really bother me.  Actually, I thought it was a rather cute idea.  The real problem of this game is the fact that Link doesn't stay on solid ground!  There's too much sailing that goes on in the game, and it gets old fast.  It takes forever and is just all around tedious.  Also, I found the frustration level for this game to be quite high.  It's to be expected that you'd have to repeat certain spots of the gameplay in order to get it right and move on.  However, there were certain parts where Link had to be angled *just* right.  Which sometimes took an hour to accomplish; that is if I didn't just throw the controller at the screen first.  I just gave up and stopped playing it because my anger level was just getting too high.  No game is worth that kind of frustration.	-1
This is the worst zelda game of all time for all nintendo systems.  It just doesn't have the charm of the other zelda games.  It gets really old and tedious spending all that time sailing across an ocean. Somehow sailing across an ocean and Link just don't match up. It doesn't stand the test of time like the other zelda's.  I played through all zelda games all the way through.  Here's my favorite zelda games in order.........  1.  Link To The Past - snes  2.  Ocarina of Time - N64  3.  Legend of Zelda - nintendo  4.  Majora's Mask - N64  5.  Legend of Zelda 2 - nintendo  6.  Windwaker - gamecube  Sorry folks nintendo got it wrong with windwaker.  Hopefully they'll redeem the magic of zelda with twilight princess.	-1
A long time ago when Zelda first came out, it was a lot fun.  The graphics were really cheesy but still a good time.  Now, the graphics are still cheesy but the game is terrible.  There's nothing worse for a game when you can't speed up the conversation; and there's a lot of it in this game.  It is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.  I think this is one game you should rent first before buying, because it really is frustrating.	-1
I don't mean to crash anyones party but this game sucked... Its nothing like the other Zelda games.... I LOVED the origenal Zelda the best... And I liked all the others because they where based on the origanal, but this one is a totally diffrent story... it shouldn't have the opertunity to be have "Zelda" in its title. If they would change the green outfit (the only thing linking it to any of the other Zelda games) No one would even know it was sapposed to be a Zelda game.	-1
Pathetic and unworthy of the name "Legend of Zelda."  When I saw screenshots for this game prior to its release I was up in arms, as were many people, and ready to avoid this game like the plague. Unfortunately, many people seem (for some unknown reason) to have been won over by the game after its release; I, however, found the disappointment of playing this game to be exactly commensurate with my expectations.  I decided to give the game an honest chance; I thought, "Just look at it as Ocarina of Time with different graphics and different levels." Sadly, the only thing carried over from OoT were the horrible controls (funny how technology advances and Nintendo still can't manage to achieve correspondence between controller inputs and character actions; oh well...), though one could stretch a point and say that OoT did introduce gratuitously bizarre new elements to the Zelda world (the Goron race comes to mind), but TWW takes this to such an extreme that I cannot forgive it for its eccentricities as I did OoT.  TWW is boring and embarrassing. Boring because the story has virtually no connection to the prior Zelda games, so the hardcore fan really has to make a mental leap to even consider this as continuous with the other games. Boring also because the game starts out with sheer tedium; it took what seemed like forever to get the sword, only to lose it in the first level. And the game actually starts out with a Gerudo Fortress-like level where one must evade detection. One would think that Shiggy would start the game out with the most fun and pleasant puzzles he possibly could, to encourage immersion in the game before challenging the gamer's patience, but the worst trials of my patience came right at the beginning of the game.  The game is embarrassing because it is extremely immature in a way reminiscient of Majora's Mask. I'm not sure if it's just the way the Japanese design games, but the bizarre childish characters and graphics were very off-putting. While I'm on the subject, the graphics are terrible. There is no sense that this is a Zelda game; it's a cartoon. There is certainly no sense of darkness in the game either, something every Zelda game before this has had. The game is very lighthearted and giddy and yet tedious. Excellent combination for boring me to death.  I kept playing, hoping for a break to the boredom, but it never came. I stopped playing this game and have no intention of coming back to it. Adventure of Link was good enough as a game that I finished it, but this game is just terrible. Stay away unless you want to be a Miyamoto-barning fanboy.	-1
Zelda is the most over rated game series ever made. And Wind Waker is the worst Zelda game made. First of all i will just start talking about how bad the graphics are. What we are looking at here are 2D Pixel Shaded Graphics. I can possibly understand these graphics for a racing game, or possibly a fighting game. BUT NOT AN ADVENTURE GAME. Yes Ocarina of time was OK, but not good enough to save this series. Wind Waker completly destroyed it. Link looks and talks like a complete loser. But you may say graphics aren't everything. I can agree with that SOMETIMES, but when they are as horrific as these, i cant even play the game. Now the story and gameplay. Can u hit Z and press the A button multiple times? Well then you can beat Zelda Wind Waker. The game is meant for kids, no doubt about that. There is a talking Ship FFS. What is going on here nintendo?!?! I think you get my point on why windwaker sucks. The main things are that the graphics suck, and the game is easy, boring, and just plain stupid.	-1
I decided to pick this game up, but was disappointed. I was expecting alittle more action death coolness, but it wasn't there. It was pretty little link prancing around with a little dagger "getting the bad guys." If your over 11 years old i wouldn't even bother. Though the fact that it is link with a sword, and a well made battle mode i give it 2/2 stars	-1
For anyone who didn't go to E3 This year well I have big news! THERE WILL BE A BRAND NEW ZELDA GAME(STill in the works) Comming soon!  I witnessed it and was just plain SHOCKED! 1. This was no Wind waker 2 I can tell you this 2. The graphics looked unbelievable! 3. This will be an entirley different zelda game and will not have anything to do with Wind Waker 2.  I don't even think there will be a WW2! I cant even describe How incredible this game looks, this game was only a minute and 7 seconds!!!! The game has ubelievable graphics. Its Soul calibur 2 but with steriods!  What most people referd to ww was UNREALISTIC.  WELL GUESS WHAT...THIS IS!! Dont believe me??

THIS IS JUST FLAT OUT AWSOME....I AM STill shocked even after May 14th...... Go watch the trailer now!!!	-1
What happened to Zelda?  Where did it go?  What am I babbling about?  Well, I'd love to explain to you all the problems I had with this game, but unfortunately, I can only use a certain number of words for this review, so I'll cover all the main problems I had with it. First and most important is the ending.  The ending was depressing for anyone who's ever played a Zelda title.  Changing the ending alone would have been enough to make the game about 5 times better.  I won't tell you what it was, only that it was TERRIBLE. Secondly, the Gameplay barely existed.  I found that half the game was spent doing NOTHING.  I just set up my sail and waited for five minutes while the game propelled me to my next destination.  The other half of the game was spent fighting battles and solving puzzles that were so easy, no five-year-old would fail at them. Storyline-wise, this game is a flop.  It contains only one realistically-behaving character; Ganon.  The rest of the characters are the product of plot holes, and are moved along BY the story, not the other way around.  Big problem in any game these days. The graphics annoyed me, but only because the character models were very ugly.  And as for the music, it just seemed incongrous very often. Plus, none of the characters talk!  On the GCN!  That's laziness to the umteenth power from a game-design perspective. Still, although I thought this game was a piece of garbage, there are those who found it fun, so I would be being unfair to say it is IMPOSSIBLE to like this game, despite all the huge, gaping flaws and mindless tedium it showcases.  To make everyone happy, I reccomend that you rent this game once to see whether or not you'll like it.  Don't make the mistake of buying it right off the bat like I did.	-1
I borrowed this game to try it out. I had never played a Zelda game before and had heard that they were really good. But after I played it awhile, I found myself incredibly bored. I got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already! And although Link (the main character) has a sword, he rarely uses it. Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again.  Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a "puzzle" game. I call it a BORING game. I suggest you buy a Mario game, which cleverly combines puzzle with action.	-1
Alright, let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved Ocarina of Time.  It was one of the best games I have ever played.  But what happened here?  Its like a wanna be paper Mario, or something.  The new graphics all the magazines claim are "revalutionary" are really really sad.  The puzzles and stuff in Wind Waker borrow too much from OOT.  They basically took the old ones and stuck them here in the hopes that noone would notice they are the same.  The fighting is all right, but it wasn't as satisfying as previous titles. Overall, its not that bad of a game.  Its zelda, so its got to have some value.  However, it just wasn't the old run around with Link and kick butt feeling.  It was more of a ride a boat with a geek and hit people with a stick feeling.  Rent it, don't buy it.  That's my final advice.	-1
i am pimp daddy king of all that's good and nasty! this game sucked i barely see the point of this game. o u rescue your sister  whoop de freaken do. i wouldn't rescue my own sister[i'm just kidding about that i think] the graphics are awful like construction paper. DO NOT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TRY THIS GAME.	-1
Ugh, that is the most dumbest game! I loved Zelda: Ocarina of Tim and Majora's Mask. They looked great for the N64. But I was also baffled by the myster pick they showed in magazines. When this cartoon load ...came out, I screamed and hid under my bed. Link (the real one) was supposed to be in it. Not some bobble head little thing. The graphics where good, but I wanted Resident Evil looking Link and Ganondorf. Oh, Ganondork looks like he is 6000 years old, not hip and 30 like the older ones. The King of Red Dragons mouth was dubbed badly it looked dumb. STILL NO VOICE TALENT! I could understand why on the N64 they couldn't talk. But on the GCN, look at the other games! They talk! Why can't Link?! Oh and don't forget that bobble-head can't say a sentence. ...	-1
Like many people, I was skeptical about the new graphics. But when i bought the game, i went into it with an open mind. everyone said "give the gameplay a chance to speak for the game!" and i did. the gameplay is as bad as the graphics.  starting with the basics.. graphics were bland, the characters and backgrounds had no texture or detail, everything was flat, and smooth.  the sound effects were good, but the music was not exactly involving.  the real downfall of this game is the gameplay.  90% of the enemies you encounter on this game can be defeated by pushing the attack button over and over again, you could literally do it blindfolded. some of them took strategy, but not enough of them. the game was too easy. i beat the last boss on my very first try, and i don't claim to be an especially skilled gamer.  the thing i hate most about this game is the amount of time you spend doing NOTHING. the game is set on many tiny islands over a wide ocean. in order to get from island to island, you must sail there on a boat. every time you want to change directions more than 45 degrees, you have to pull out your magic conductor's baton and play a little song... this is too repetitive. and any time you want to go from island to island, be ready to spend from 5-15 minutes just watching your boat moving through the water, i fell asleep many times waiting for the next island to show up on the horizon!  this part may just be me, but i found the graphics actually irritated my eyes after a few hours, which i haven't experienced with other games.  i played this entire game with an open mind, hoping for things to improve as i progressed, but at the end i regretted spending the money, and my time on it. after beating it, i never wanted to play this game again. considering i beat it in 3 or 4 days, this game is definitely safe as a rental only. you may want to rent it just to see how badly wrong a good idea can go...	-1
The game is great. The PRODUCT is not. The CD was not recognized by any CD drive I had available. I purchased my copy through Bananzathon. I Recommend buying this game any day of the week. I recommend avoiding that particular vendor more.	-1
This was listed as a new product, however I received it and it was not in factory packaging.  It should have been listed as USED and not NEW.  I didn't want a "like new" product, I wanted a factory sealed copy.	-1
Seeing the incredible reviews here I went ahead and bought the game to satisfy my sci-fi gaming urge. I was like the game is older but has great reviews and the screen-shots/videos looked good enough. But I should have listened to my inner voice trying to warn me that there must be a reason that this game never got a expansion or sequel. Even though I got the game at a really low price but after playing it for few days I regret even spending that money. Anyways here is what ails & doesn't ail me;  CONS  1)Repetitious to the nth degree. You do get to visit different worlds but other than a scenery change the missions are the same over & over. You pretty much fly to a way-point; dog-fight with pirates or attack other ships, maybe destroy a space-station sometime, you can also mine or destroy a derelict ship to get upgrades for your vessel but in the end all these missions are just variations of the basic premise of a space-shooter on rails.  2)If you want to be a trader, or pure mine or find some other non-combat way to advance your character that is not really possible. The game is designed in a way that for you to progress beyond star systems you have to complete part of the required story-line as well as have certain threshold of money. That is only possible via doing combat missions of the main plot/side-quests otherwise you will not have enough money or enough progression to move to the next zone. So in all this is at-heart a pure action space rpg.  3) They are also 4-5 npc's at best in the game who you will meet all over the galaxy saying almost the same dialogue and handing you over essentially the same missions just worded differently.  4) Even though you will be visiting different planets, sectors etc. you really can't travel anywhere other than pre-assigned rooms where the above mentioned npc's gives you newer missions making the game feel confined rather than open-world.  PROS  1) Graphics of space-ships, stations, planets etc. are impressive and holds well even to this day.  2) You can upgrade your ship with armaments, equipment or buy better ships over-time which gives a decent rpg feel to the game.  3) The cut-scenes (though repetition abounds here too) helps propel the story and gives the game that quint-essential rpg feel.  In the end this is a ambitiously conceived sci-fi rpg yet a poorly executed game. I actually came here expecting a Eve offline but alas it's more of a action rpg that is designed for people looking for immediate gratification.  EDIT: I got my hands on X3:Terran Conflict and it's the space sim that I have been looking for a long time. If you are looking for a open-ended, single player space simulator rpg with incredible visuals or essentially a Eve Offline than check out Egosoft's X-series games.	-1
...and that gets old pretty quick with the relatively small universe. I think everyone should just face what this game is. It's a repetitive, boring, gameplayless wreck. You spend more than half the game flying from place to play hitting the F3 key to jump in trade link after trade link. Calling this open-ended is a total joke. There really are only three things you can do, you can be a fighter, trader, or pirate. The most interesting, of course, is the fighter. You get missions to do, but unfortunately, every. single. one. is go here, and fight these ships, and possibly a base and turrets. You can always buy better ships and the ludicrously powerful hidden ships, but doing missions nets in a pitiful amount of cash, so you'll be forced to start the game being a trader. Being a trader defines mediocrity. You travel from place to place clicking buy, then clicking sell at another place. This nets the easiest cash so you can buy a better ship of your choice later. The next step up to a flying joke is being a pirate. Choosing this occupation serves no purpose. The point is to destroy other ships, preferably trading ships, and taking their cargo. The cash you can receive this way is pathetic, and if you choose this, everyone will hate you and you won't be able to dock many places. Since the whole idea is to destroy trading ships and hit that button that tractors in cargo, this gets old reeeaaaal fast. You can't even dock on the other ship and hijack it, even when disabling them. If they decide to make a sequel, there absolutely HAS to be a more personal ship, something you can wander around in, and for heaven's sake it has to be bigger than the teeny-tiny ships you get, even the supposedly massive trading ships are pathetically small. I would also love to see multiplayer done better, it would be a godsend if you could board and hijack other ships as a pirate, or just to climb aboard someone else's ship or dock on a trading ship to get a free ride somewhere, and to act as a deployable fighter escort. Rather than acting as a ship, it should be more as acting as a player, one that can contribute to other players. Anything would do. Being able to assign roles to people on ships, particularly trade ships, would be wonderful. A deeper systems management would be great, someone to worry about the engine powers and to fix any malfunctions, someone to worry about the weapons and the power they sap up, and someone to worry about steering. To think about the huge amount of things they could've done with this game, it's sorry to see how short they sold themselves, particularly considering the development time. Next to worthless.	-1
Freelancer can't seem to figure out what kind of game it is. The marketing says it is a game directed by the way you play. In practice, it has a very linear plot that you are railroaded into following. If you want to play as a trader or miner, the marketing says it will support you. In practice, combat is thrust upon you so freqeuntly that you have little choice but to get a ship built for war. The marketing says it has role-playing elements. In reality, it is an action game with cut-scenes showing the plot. It is too simple to be a great space combat sim, but the combat is too hard for it to be an RPG. The choices are few and usually binary. I wanted Morrowind in space. I got frustration and disappointment.	-1
Kung Fu Chaos is the game where there are really weird characters fighting each other. I got bored of it in just a few months. Basically, the game is about when you are trying to get a position of a fighting actor or actress by the director who has been a complete failure.  The GOOD THINGS about Kung Fu Chaos:  The selection of things to do- Instead of just fighting, you have adventure mode, and also a fighting time where you fight about 15 minutes and see how many people you have killed for the last 15-30 minutes.  The creativity- The creators did a great job of making up places where they would have auditions. Falling down a escalator then explodes and all of that kind of stuff. It is very cool what they did with that.  The BAD THINGS about Kung Fu Chaos:  Replay value- Basically, replay value means how long you will be willing to play it. This game has a bad replay value. I stopped playing it in a few months. I found another game and started playing that instead.  The controls- When you first play, it should be a little bit diffucult about how this game is supposed to be played. Instead, there are so many controls that you don't know what to do. It took me a good week to understand the controls.  This game is alright for the price. So if you like to play a good fighting game for a few months, go right ahead a buy it.	-1
Kung-Fu Chaos has you fighting in arenas where you can ring out, or use objects like tables, chairs and even people to toss at your opponent. Up to four people can play simultaneously or you can play by yourself one-on-one. You can also team up with BOTS to fight against the cpu. The game has very cartoonish looking graphics, the sound effects and dialog are corny like an old Kung-Fu movie. In fact, you are playing inside a kung-fu movie. You'll hear the director telling you what to do and making snide remarks when you make a mistake. The whole game is silly and feels very childish. Not my cup of tea! I'm shocked that it got lots of good reviews here. Pros: +funny +instant replay +up to four players +play with BOTS +okay for kids Cons: -unresponsive controls -cheap sound effects -thinks it's funny -BOTS are stupid -nobody ever dies -limited attack moves -gets old fast -stupid music -retarded and pointless gameplay -small fighting space I feel sorry for the people that bought this game for themselves and lost money. I was smart enough to just rent it.	-1
This game is pretty silly. I mean its alright to rent to kill time or something, but other than that this is for the younger kids around ages 5 to 13, I'd say. Or if you have a bunch of family members in the house that are in to gaming its something you can all get into, but other than those reasons there is no reason to buy this game.	-1
Amazon US doesn't list the PC version of this game. But it's pretty much exactly the same anyway.  First off, I hated how hard it was to stay alive in the first level. I went searching for codes on the Internet and surprisingly there is no codes, F.A.Q's, walk throughs, help guides ...nothing! (Ignore a code that says if you pause the game and type "best kept secret" it makes you immortal. It does not work at all)  I managed to find a site that had a download to run during the game that gives you max energy, power and ammo (invisibility). Found at [...] download that trainer thing. I give it 5 stars for working flawlessly.  Now that I couldn't be killed (except when I got squished in a thing) I was free to test out Robocop. I thought the game was pretty good. I played a level each day cause I'd have enough by the end of each level. I loved getting to level 3 and confronting ED-209. the graphics are decent 3D stuff. The quotes are amusing for a while, especially when you kill a good guy and Robo says, "sowwwwwwreeeee"  However, a few of the levels I really grew tired of. Playing out like a Duke Nukem/Doom kinda game, it kinda got annoying on a level down in a mine where you have to destroy all the boxes before a certain door will open. A map would really help navigation out instead of wondering around till you wing it. The levels are too big to become instantly memorable so that you know where everything is in future. Sometimes they're just confusing as hell or annoying.  CONTROLS The controls aren't that bad. You use your mouse to aim and shoot. The right button can be changed; I used it to open doors. You use your arrow keys to move. And various other keys do different things; Like a zoom feature. Or press 1 on the num pad to make Robo twirl the gun around.  "Can you do that, dad?"  GRAPHICS Compared to similar sort of games like Duke Nukem, GoldenEye, Wolfenstien ect... this ones nice on the graphics in its own way, the 3D graphics look awesome on some stages, others there quite boring. Tho, some stages have had more time and effort put into them. In some stages sometimes you can shoot various things like lights, signs, cars and things, but on other stages there just a graphic. Ed-209 looks great, but there are some things added for the hell of it I think. I didn't understand what a giant rat in a sewer was about. It's like someone developed a rat on their computer and decided to put it in a game just to see what it would look like.  The videos look dodgy. I'm ok with it that they're just to tell the story. But they looked like they where made and then there was no room left to add them to the game after it was completed so they got compressed to hell to fit on the disc.  SOUND A lot of people complained about the sound of this game. I didn't complain about much of it. I didn't take much notice of the music, the quotes where amusing for a while. But in the end I was just playing without the sound on. It doesn't help with anything you need to do.  LEVEL 9 Overall the game was OK until the last level. For starters, it took me a few minutes to work out what the hell I was supposed to be doing. It seems Robo freezes in spot while you wait for the bad robot to climb into his diplodocus neck, robotic machine. You cant skip this bit which sux for this reason; Once you've killed the robot by standing in the middle and shooting at the red things on the neck when it's shooting its lasers at you; the robot dies, it plays a video and then you have disarm the bomb going off in one minute. You walk to 8 different machine's and choose which code you think de-activates it. If you get 3 wrong, the whole lot restarts and you have to do them again. I thought I might find the correct codes out first, write them down and then restart the level and get them right. But nope! After waiting boringly for the robot to start up, I finally got back to the bit to disarm them, and what do you know, codes aren't the same! That really sux when you can't finish the game without LUCK on your side. There is no skill I could find to it other then a good memory, you just have to be lucky to get through it. Other wise the clock runs down and Robo says, "OH, S###" and the whole city blows up. Yet some cop is still alive to say "I wouldn't want you on my team, go back to the police academy" then you have to wait too long for that robot to start up again when you start the level again and for me, I have no patience, i want to get into these things instantly, not be made to wait.  OVERALL: The game was fun to begin with. I thought it was cool. That was until I clocked it. And realised it has no replay value. Once you beat the game there is nothing to do. Why it lets you save it after you've beaten it is beyond me, cause all it does is lets you see the crappy 2-second ending of a TV report and then goes back to the main menu when you load your saved game. What's the point of that? You can go back and re-do missions you didn't get all the stuff for, and maybe when you do that and get them all 100% complete it unlocks something? But quite frankly I don't care if it does or doesn't, I'm done playing it. Once I beat it, I had no desire to play it again. It was cool while it lasted, but nothing to redeem it like other shoot em ups have had. Plus, something other then walking around shooting would've helped the game a bit. Like driving, boating, flying, something other then 9 levels of the same thing.  Something that I heard about this game was that they had ignored the movies part 2 and 3 and said this was like they hadn't existed. This was the follow up to the original movie. Honestly, I couldn't tell AT ALL. I didn't see anything that looked familiar at all apart from ED-209 and Anne Lewis of OCP. (so ignoring the fact she got killed in the sequel is reason enough to say that stuff is it?)  PROS - Decent graphics - fun quotes - huge levels - good controls  CONS - sux without the cheats to stay alive - levels can be too big to be bothered navigating - no replay value - no ending after completion - no multi player mode - not enough levels - needed something other then just walking and shooting all the time - Needs more guns - No spike (that thing in Robo's hand)	-1
This game has nothing to do with Robots and Cops. Besides, Robots and Cops do not mix. Plus, if it's a game, then it's a bad game. I hate getting taken by cops and I hate kiddish robot toys. And this is a flawy game.	-1
Oh, where to begin. This game is rotten to the core. Everything that can possibly, literally go wrong with a game is crammed into this mess.  It's nothing to do with RoboCop. Nothing. This game seems like an abandoned Wolfenstein or Duke Nukem game from 1995 (the dated horrible graphics indicate this right away) that has had a tiny, tiny bit of RoboCop pasted into it order to repackage it and get it out there are soon as possible.  It should never have been allowed to get out there in the first place. The game is absolutely RIDDLED with bugs. There are dozens of things that RoboCop needs to do but the programming won't accommodate. Such as getting stuck in a location or walking up stairs or opening doors. The bad guys have no AI at all and end up firing at walls most of the time. They all look the same (guy in shirt with gun) and are really boring to shoot.  RoboCop's gunfire sounds like a Commodore 64 sound effect. And since when did Robo say 'Oh yeah!' or 'Bullseye' when killing someone? And why oh why is a giant mutated rat in a supposed RoboCop game?  The gameplay is terrible. The targeting system is rubbish (Robo will automatically target energy/ammo pick-ups and bad guys at the same time. Which is which? It happens too quick and it is useless too). I would have preferred the targeting system Robo has in the movies but here we get rectangles highlighting the bad guys. It looks stupid.  The music is trash too. I would play with the volume turned down. Or not play it at all. This game should never have been allowed out. Shame on Titus and Virgin Interactive for producing such a travesty.	-1
I dunno, I don't wanna sound harsh but I've played better games.  It seems like the path of the Superhero games. You read some great pre-release articles, then when the game hits the shelves it's a major disappointment.  - The gameplay is difficult to get used to, it's like you're in Murphy's head and you got this gun sticking out from the bottom of the screen. You pan back and forth and when your sensor picks up a bad guy, even if he's in a building, you gotta aim pretty fast and waste him before he shoots at you or someone else starts shooting at you, otherwise your vision turns into a bad TV Channel and you're toast. Keep this with the Batman Dark Tomorrow game.	-1
Its just a useles game disc but a nice frisbee. The game needs an xbox live gamer tag to play, plus this game won't work on the 360 and if your aware there is no way to make a gamer tag on the original xbox so this game is obsolete. But you can get the gamecube version which is alive and strong. DONT buy this from any seller. I found this out the hard way and its my own fault.	-1
ce jeu est pas mal ressemblant a la version de dremacast , pas grand amelioration graphique. aussi le probleme est que l on dois payer 9.99$us par mois pour jouer en plus de devoir etre inscris a xbox live. ca fais cher pas mal pour un seul jeu. je ne le recommande pas a moins que vous soyez un grand fan de ce jeu.	-1
Wolfenstein is a legendary frachise. First appearing on Apple before the time of the Mac...then Atari, DOS, Commodore64...ID software picked up the ball and Wolfenstein 3D became one of the first FPS (first person shooters)...leading into Doom, Quake, and the rest is history.  Tides of War is an incredibly ugly, flat, lifeless, colorless and borish game. The graphics relative to other xbox games of it's era simply do not measure up. Very dissapointing.  Quake3 Engine. Not the best.	-1
This game has way below average graphics and sound.  It has no real storyline.  It's like an old doom game which were alright then, but should be much better now.  The replay value is nothing great.  Avoid this and go for any Tom Clancy stuff or Halo or many other shooters over this one.  What a dissapointment.	-1
The game was a complete disappointment. Maybe I had my expectations set a bit too high. All the landscapes seem similar and like one of the other reviewers correctly pointed out, the controls make your head spin. Very difficult to figure out where you are on the map and where your partner is (if you play the co-op mode)and the colors downright suck	-1
Didnt turn onn after chargeing.	-1
way to short	-1
bought as "good", came less than acceptable. love the electronic itself but I had to return due to poor quality of item.	-1
product came damaged in a way that was not listed in the description. I didn't have the time or effort to spare in order to handle this at the time and so the useless device gets to stay.	-1
I've only played the first 3 boards so far.  However that's enough to know this game is worth only $..., not $.... The shooting action and killing action are fairly [bad].  When you shoot, you don't get the sense that your doing the shooting.  It feels more like your pushing a button on a controller which is activating an animated gun on your television screen.  The same is true for when you hit someone (shooting them).  When you hit a bad guy they just fall-no dust blowing off of their jackets or blood. If you played and liked Medal of Honor or the oldies like 007 goldeneye(N64)or Perfect Dark(N64), then you will be disappointed.  I consider realistic gunshots(a sense of recoil and power coupled with good sound effects) to be the most important element of a good 1st person shooter, if that [is bad] then there is not much worth playing for. Otherwise the graphics were just OK.  Nothing to right home about.  Controls were decent, learning curve pretty short (10min). Overall this game brings nothing new to 1st person shooters.  It would have been better if released in May 1995.  If your thinking about buying this I would definately rent it first or just dig out Goldeneye from your archives. I'm assuming the PC version is a whole lot beter because I keep seeing rave reviews for the PC.  If you play this on PS2 and are raving then I would guess your only about 10 or 12 years old and never played the games mentioned above before.	-1
I admit, I'm not really all that interested in first person shooter, so I don't play Medal of Honor or any of those games, but I was a huge fan of the original Wolfenstein games that came out centuries ago, and I am also a big fan of Duke Nukem games, even Golden Eye on 64 etc... so don't let my lack of interest in many first person shooters make you think I am just being nostalgic.  This game didn't make me feel like I was returning to Wolfenstein at all. Sure, the original was a bunch of pixels and mazes with nazi's to kill and dogs coming at you, but the feel of this game doesn't feel the same at all. I felt more like I was in some movie starring Jason Stathman as he is sent in to kill nazi's and protect India Jones as he looks for ancient treasure. The first thing I noticed the moment I started playing was the computer AI is horribly programmed. The first nazi I come by ran right up to me, past me, then ran behind me somewhere, like he was looking for a good place to sit down to take aim, and before he could, he was shot dead. Then I noticed things around the place that is there for no reason. I come across some motorbikes, they make noises... do they do anything? No, can you ride them? No. Can you blow them up? No. Why are they there? At least in Duke Nukem games if a useless object is there, say when I found the Delorean from Back To The Future, in Time To Kill (or Land of the babes? one of the two) Duke quote's Biff Tannen and says, "Hello, McFly, Anyone home?", it's pointless, but none the less humorous. Where Activision trying to copy that by just adding random things trying to be funny? Or did someone just say, "euhh, there's too much wall, put a bike in-front of it."  The second thing I really don't like about this game is the controls. They work OK for what they are, but what they lack is any control over aiming where you want to shoot. A lock onto enemy button would have been nice, or at least auto aim or something, because I don't know how tired I got of coming down stairs and someone is shooting me, and I have to look down in order to shoot them... it sounds like something you could get used to, but it feels like you are armed with a sling shot, while a mouse is running frantically between your legs in circles as you try to look down and maneuver around in circles yourself trying to get a lock on them. That's another thing... you only need to hit an enemy close enough to kill them, don't worry about aiming for bodies or head shots, just fart in their general direction and they will eventually smell it.  In the original Wolfenstien there was a tonne of great array you could choose from. In this one, there is barely a decent weapon to be found. Most of them are hand guns, sniper rifles and single shot pistols. There is only a couple of machine guns, most of which are semi-automatics, and from what I can tell, only one decent rapid firing machine gun. However, there is no big cool gun... the original version of this game you had a cool mini-gun, why wouldn't that be included in the sequel? Maybe they wanted to go a bit more realistic, as it is supposed to be set in the 1940's or so, but hey, they had bazookas, hand grenades, molotov cocktails and what not back then too... couldn't those have been integrated with the artillery of this game? God, anything to just blow up a bunch of people at once would have been nice. Maybe that's just Duke's thing, I dunno, but this game needed more, MUCH more.  The levels all seem too alike. Do you really need 10 levels per episode or the same damn thing over and over and over again? Your mission, find something, get out. Don't get killed. Next mission, find something, get out, don't get killed. And so on, and so on, and so on, and so on... YAWNNNNNNNNNNNN.  What else surprises me about this game is there is no cheats. None without a action replay device or something. Now, before you say something about real gamers don't need cheats, let me remind you, Wolfenstein was pretty much the inventor of God Mode. Remember that name? Whether you would use it or not, why would you make a sequel like this and not include what made the original so damn popular in the first place? Come on, how many of you played the original and never once used God Mode??? Or the All Weapons cheat, or even the All Keys cheat??? Come on, raise your hand. How could they forgot to include these things in this version?  I only got through about 20 levels of this game before I packed it in out of boredom or having to do the same thing over and over and over again. I really don't care how the game ends. Obviously Statham and Indy beat the bad guys, the proof lies in history, because the Nazi's where all taken out when Luke Skywalker blew up the Death Star II.  The last thing is the sound, or should I say sounds. The sound of weapons and everything is fine, but the sounds of the Nazi's is what puts me off. They all speak perfect English! One of the coolest things of the original game was the sounds of the Nazi's saying things you had no idea what, unless you spoke German, but come on, why do they all speak English and say, "There he is, get him"... not even in a German accent???  One last thing, it's not a biggie... but remember the cute pitbulls in the original? I would have liked to see them return and come running after me for a bullet to the forehead... unless they are somewhere later in the game, they don't make a return. Damn FCC and PETA. Cruelty to animals in the real world is wrong, but in video games it should be OK. It's not like anyone who played Mario Bros went out and stomped on a turtle and kicked his shell into a sewer pipe.  ____Overall____  Gameplay  : 3/5 Story  : 2/5 Grahpics  : 2/5 Controls  : 3/5 Sound  : 2/5 Replay V  : 0/5 Extras  : 0/5 ________________ Total  | 1.7	-1
This game is terrible.  I rushed out and bought it on release day.  If only I had a time machine....  I only played about 15 minutes of this game and turned it off.  I got rid of it as fast as possible.  The graphics are lame and the gameplay is not much better.  The controls were confusing to say the least.  What bothered me the most, however, was the glitches.  I repeatedly witnessed enemies getting "hung up" on things in the game, thus allowing me to wail on them while they could not chase me or attack.  Overall = Terrible  The PC version of this game is much, much, much better and I highly recommend it, especially compared to this pathetic attempt at gaming.	-1
this Game Boy Advance doesn't work correctly! the buttons are worn out, the shell is scratched, and there's a spot on the screen, and there's small dirt on the top right corner of the screen.	-1
Of course, I should have read the description but I was excited to be getting an sp. Wtf would anyone buy an unworking gameboy?	-1
Item was advertised as being very beat up. So I didn't have a problem with the cosmetic condition of it. However, when I received it the game boy itself was not working. I had multiple games and tried every one of them, but still no luck. I took a look inside of the catridge slot and noticed some sticky substance covering the last 4 prong. About 15-20 min later I removed the substance with a tooth pick and then it loaded the games fine. I thought I was all set. I them noticed that the r shoulder button did not work properly and eventually stopped working all together. My solution to solving this is blowing as hard as I could into the slot where the button was located 10 or 15 times. This solved the problem for about 5 min then would it would happen again. So I had to repeat the process about every 5 min for it to work. The games I played use the r button regularly so I was pretty annoyed. None of this was disclosed to me and I felt the seller was very dishonest and trying to take advantage of anyone that bought it. He should have told me about these conditions and if he was unaware of them it was his fault for not testing the system to determine if it was in proper working order. I would give him zero stars if I could. Very dissatisfied and will never buy from him again.	-1
I've got a real bone to pick with EA. They just keep giving the Xbox wavw after wave of games with poor graphics and less features than on the PS2. Now, I am real close to dumping EA and begin playing Sega Sports games (which has some very sold games) PROS: 1. everything Triple Play wasnt 2. some original spots (throw meter, franchise momentum, etc.) 3. commentary is decent CONS: 1. lightyears behind the other baseball games 2. yet another case of PS2 graphics syndrome 3. Faces look pasted on 4. controls are confusing 5. there is no point to Pitching 6. Franchise mode is all hype 7. cannot control fielding at all 8. impossible to get on base 9. beginning trailer is a real turnoff FINAL VERDICT: do not waste your time and money on buying this game. If you think I'm wrong, rent it first, then well see whos saying, "why didn't you tell me this game stunk?"	-1
what i liked:  at least the graphics were good what i disliked:  where's the fantasy draft? i can't edit players (which is particularly  helpful for young prospects). thus, hank blalock's ratings will stay around 50 (in other words, he's useless) while blue jays ss chris woodward has a power rating of 88 (he may have 20 career home runs). a player will either post ruthian-like numbers or he will be completely inept. with the devil rays, i played about 30% of my games up until the all-star break and aubrey huff posted .420-38-97, while the rest of my team managed a batting around .260 with only 10 more home runs. try to create a player and you quickly realize that there is a 7 character max. for first and last names, i was left with rocco baldeli. the dynasty mode could be more ambitious. within the dynasty mode there is a rookie draft where the only power hitters are second baseman and the center fielders are slower than the catchers. when pitching, the fastball is rarely effective unless it is out of the zone. this is quite an anomaly considering many pitchers can touch 104 mph. i recommend renting the '04 version before buying. i certainly will, as this game sucks.	-1
I HATE IT! Broken L button, no games work on it, could not use it. i am returning it	-1
I'm flabbergasted for two reasons:  First, how did Activision manage to make a PS2 sequel to a PS1 game that's actually WORSE than the original??  It defies logic! This game has the absolute WORST CAMERA ANGLES OF ALL-TIME!!!  To top it off, the character movement and combat is "wooden" at best.  I have better games on my friggin cell phone.  Second, how in the LL Cool J did so many Amazon users give this a good review??  Argh!  You'd be better off playing PS1 'Tenchu: Stealth Assassin' again than wasting your time on this stinker.  Seriously.  ADDED: Playing Wrath of Heaven is like playing the unfinished test-version of Stealth Assasin.	-1
Good graphics, great concept, great story, immersive gameplay - ALL of this completely ruined by terrible, uncontrolable camera angles. To me it wasn't worth the 5 dollars I paid for it on eBay. All they had to do was fix the camera...unbelievable.	-1
I've played all the other Tenchu games to date and this one is definetly better than the second one they tried to pass over as a game ahwile back.  But it stops there - there is nothing really new here at all.  This game is very similiar to the first Tenchu in many aspects but not new in many at all.  Controls and sounds are pretty close - with some new power-up moves and ways of rewarding the stealthier ninja players. One thing I can not stand is the fact that there is no savepoints in the game.  You screw up in the middle of a level, or how about falling off a cliff at the end of a level, and you can just kiss your 30min of perfect stealth kills goodbye, cause you get to start over from the beginning, oh what joy. If you liked the first Tenchu - this has the same basic formula and will not dissapoint.  If you like for developers to expand on ideas and actually try to improve their games, look elsewhere.  This is a graphics update and story change from the first Tenchu in a nutshell.  Decent game, great idea with the stealth kills but bad design descisions for the player to enjoy themselvs.	-1
This game is hard. There are 30 missions, which are bland. As for replay value in single player mode... It really isn't there. "But you can stealth kill!" There is little motivation to stealth kill once you get 10(then you get a new ability). There is really no story what-so-ever. It also gets a little moronic when you have to fight a bunch of undead. Pretty soon you just stop fighting real people. It is kinda retarted. As I said just now, enemys are stupid. The AI is terrible. Then the monsters... my gosh the creativity partment is lacking. Demons are terrible at doing anything. Then there are a bunch of wooden robots. What? Wooden Robots? Apparently wooden robots die when you slit their wooden throats. It's almost as if the creators got bored, because I did. The stealth kills are alright though. Environments suck. The game is pretty much stealth kill ahoy. Sometimes it is a little moronic when enemys give up after 3 seconds of searching. Seriously. They will literally stop looking for you after a couple seconds. After you do some bland areas the game isn't so bad. It is still not a worthy investment though. Let me break it down. Pros: Stealth Kills Ninjas Cooperative mode Cons: Bland levels Pathetic story line Horrendously moronic AI Stupid bad-guys.	-1
The guy says this is new but it is old,and the on and off swictch is broken and shuts off by itself. It was 2 weeks late. When I recieved it, was dirty. Do not trust this person.	-1
Okay I just tried playing the demo of this game because someone advised this. I couldn't play it. It took like 5 minutes for him to close the door. Why do they move so slowly? I couldn't stand it. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. If the game is slow like this demo I will not buy this.	-1
Save your money, (even if it goes on sale) this is the worst game I have ever played. If you want to play a fun game play Longest Journey or Syberia or Dark Fall, Post Mortem is the most boring game ever and the music was lousy, interaction was awful, and the characters have no personality. The puzzles are almost non-existant. Sorry, but I wasted my money so save yours.	-1
I was captivated by that game for a couple hours when I started playing, then I merely played it because as an adventure games fan, I had to finish it, and at least see the end. The atmosphere is pretty good, and the story is OK (If you're not sick of games involving the Templars). If it weren't for the canned, unskippable dialogs, I would have given this game 3 stars.	-1
didn't work on my ps3	-1
I am a huge fan of the first and second sequel to the Matrix. This game was almost a complete disappointment. The first thing that really sucked is that you don't play as Neo or even Morpheus or Trinity!! Now, you tell me how you can make a half-decent Matrix video game without our favorite characters!!! The slow motion features were pretty cool. Some of the levels were really bad but some were alright. The game is pretty fun to fool around with and beat a few times but the storyline is terrible. It's like a little bit of Matrix Reloaded but changed around a lot to make it bad. I thought it was very disappointing but if it wasn't called the Matrix video game and it was another whole thing I would like it much more.	-1
To Ataris credit, this game was a bit fun.  You could do neat little tricks like cartwheeling while blasting away your enemies, cool hand to hand combat moves, and of course, do it all in slow motion.  But the fun ended shortly, just like the game.  The game quickly got repeditive.  There was only a small number of moves in your aresenal, and once you used them a couple of times, it got boring.  And, like the fun, the game stopped as abrubtly.  I finished the game in one afternoon, then found out you could play as another character, which was stupid anyway because the gameplay with different characters was only MILDLY different at best, usually only a different setting, and then beat the game again the same afternoon.  The multiplayer was boring because it was only hand to hand combat which got old fast.  Overall, the game is somewhat amusing, for about a day.  Not much more fun after that.  There's no replay value iun the game, not an ounce.  And to top that off, the coolest thing you can do is run on walls at r e a l l y s l o w s p e e d s.  Honestly, Atari can do a little better than that.	-1
Used Acceptable is debatable. The casing was so trashed it had to be replaced the screen has a dead pixel and was also scratched so badly it effected gameplay. It also didn't come with a charger. Buying it from Amazon Warehouse I had higher expectations.	-1
Don't get me wrong, this game is great.  But the game could have used MUCH more tech support before release.  It wasn't THAT important for it to come out the same day as Reloaded, was it? You can't even beat the XBOX version, as a bug freezes the game right as you go through a vital door.  The PS2 version freezes during loading, and the GCN chase sequence at the end?  I hope you don't run into the walls, as you'll get stuck in them...  I guess the Architect crashed the Matrix, cause this is UBERREALISTIC to some of the stuff Neo and crew go through in the movies...	-1
At first, I found myself throughly enjoying enter the matrix, but after just 3 or 4 missions, I realized that gameplay consists of a simple pattern: walk into a room, kill everyone there, next room, same thing, end level.  Sounds like alot of games, but enter the matrix really just doesn't have enough to it.  The cutscenes between missions use the actual actors, so the game is really good for filling you in on the parts we didn't get to see with Reloaded, sadly though, thats really the only thing the game  has going for it. If you really like the matrix, its deffinetly worth a rental, but a purchase?  I'd have to say, no.  It gets boring very quickly, not worth your 50 bucks. PROS: Engaging, fun, cool looking combat. Sweet weapons Cutscenes with the actuall actors CONS: No real substance Lags at times on PC, and even on the consoles. FAR too short. way to linear, no real environments.	-1
