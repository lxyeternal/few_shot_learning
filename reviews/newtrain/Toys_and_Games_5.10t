This is a good toy for an older toddler/small child - the age recommendation is 6+ and I think that is because it has a bigger stomp pad, you need a little more weight (and both feet) on it for the rocket to go far (although my bigger 4 year old enjoys seeing it go even a few feet in the air).  I stomp on it to make it go super high - and it does.  This is our go-to birthday gift right now esp. in the spring/summer months because you really need the outside space (limited trees & roof tops) to have fun with it.  It is a little tough getting the rocket portion to stay straight up & down but overall this has been alot of fun for both myself and my child.  It comes with 4 total rockets in case you lose a few.  This one is not the whistling version (there is a different version or brand that has rockets that "whistle" on the way up or down).	1
My 4 1/2 year old daughter loves this toy.  So far it has held up to her stomping on it as hard as she can to see how far she can make the rockets fly.  I'm glad it came with 4 rockets as she has already lost one up in a tree.  The stand is kind of flimsy and keeps falling apart, but she likes to hold the hose and aim the rockets anyway.  My 2 year old twins also think it's great fun.	1
We first got one of these as a gift for my 3 year old, who loved it both indoors and out. We repurchased it for a space themed 5th birthday party and the kids had a wonderful time playing with it. Very durable and straightforward. The rockets do go very high but a very enjoyable toy to encourage outdoor play.	1
So fun, works great, my nephews (8 and 9 yo) loved it! Buy extra rockets because it comes with 2, but they quickly get lost!!	1
The rocket was a big hit with its 6 (and 3) year old recipients. Performed just as I remembered it & the kids love it.	1
wonderful toy	1
The kids love this toy! So simple but hours upon hours of fun! So easy to use for my 3yr old and my 8 year old enjoys it just as much! It's made pretty durable and works great! Shipping was fast and on time! Thanks for entertaining my kids!	1
It was a gift, but my son has played with others and he enjoys it!	1
Got as gift, as expected	1
all kids love this toy	1
I wanted to love this like so many others do, but it fell apart way too quickly.  This was a toy that my kids enjoyed for approximately 48 hours before it broke.	-1
These are just fun!	1
very funny rocket for my 6 years old son!	1
Cheap	1
A great gift...buy this a keep your 5 year old occupied for hours...we stomp and see how high it will go, who can make the rocket go higher, and on and own. I was concerned when I got it out of the box that it looked cheap. I thought one stomp and this thing is gonna break. I was wrong...we have been stomping now for a week and he is still entertained and it's still working without fail. Word of advice....buy an extra set of rockets because you will need them!	1
This is so much fun for my 4 and 6 year old. I would be lying if I said my husband and I don't have competitions to see who can get it to go the highest. It falls apart easily, but does not break. Great for the price.	1
Very fun for kids and parents. Would definitely recommend buying extra rockets as they will crack if you step on them.	1
Super fun for the kids. They loved it. Lasted quite a while too.  You can make these from 2 liter bottles, rubber hose, and a piece of pvc pipe.	1
Useful in my classroom!	1
I got several sets of magnets to teach my grandchildren science this was one of them. The quality is excellent and they will be around a long time. The floating magnet really shows how a maglift train system works and other things we use in modern life.	1
Good and tons of fun for my son.	1
Great purchase. My kids love this and enjoy playing with it.	1
My nephew absolutely loved this. It was the one toy he picked out to play with from a whole bunch of toys he received at his birthday party. He was having so much fun I thought about bullying him out of it so I could play with it lol.	1
Best toy EVER! Every kid and dad loves this. It 8s probably our most played with item even months later. Plus, it doesn't require parental involvement. I can play with my kids, but they are content to play on their own too - and that seems rare these days!	1
This product was fun. I enjoyed watching my husband and daughter play with it.	1
These were cute. Kind of flimsy, but the ides played with them a few times before we gave one away and threw the other away	1
My son has enjoyed this since Christmas. We've had a lot of fun with it. It really will go quite a ways into the air! Well worth the money spent! My advice is to order an extra set of the rockets so you don't have to retrieve them as often!	1
So much fun.	1
Im just a big kid, so whenever I visit my family, I enjoy seeing what toys and books my niece loves to play with.  Yes, we had several tea parties while I was last there.  But a trip to the park introduced me to the absolute fun that is the Ultra Stomp Rocket.  My brother and I had just as much fun with it as my niece did.  The idea is so simple its hard to believe this hasn't been around for a long time.  Several metal bars create a stand.  Attached to this stand is a hollow tube that is attached to a giant soft plastic box.  I really don't know how else to describe it since the outside is plastic and it compressed as you stomp on it.  Once this is set up on the ground, you slide a rocket on the tube.  When you're ready to let it fly, just stomp on that plastic box and watch the rocket shoot off into the air.  You can adjust the angle of the tube, so sometimes it will shoot out further and sometimes it will shoot up higher.  And right there is something that will help kids understand physics.  No, we didn't try to understand anything but having fun playing with it, but you can easily see how the angle of the launching tube greatly affects where the rocket goes.  Whether you discuss it or not, I'm sure this will click with kids when they study that in school.  It definitely goes.  My brother and I were able to launch it pretty fair and pretty high.  The rockets themselves are a light plastic with a rubbery nerf like material on the end.  (No, this is not an official nerf product.)  They land softly, although I wouldnt want to have one shot directly at me.  With the force they launch, Im sure that would hurt.  The box recommends this for ages 8 and up with supervision.  Im sure one of the reasons is to make sure kids don't get hurt shooting these at each other.  Another reason is that the launching stand takes a bit of work to get together.  Its just a matter of screwing a few pieces together, and my brother did it in a few minutes.  Im sure an 8-year-old could handle it on their own.  But heres the thing  my niece is 3 - obviously, much younger than the suggested age.  To make the rockets fly, she had to jump on the plastic box instead of step on it, and she doesnt have the weight to make it go as far as my brother and I do.  And yet she was having a blast with it.  She'd launch one and then run and get it and bring it back, grinning the entire time.  Would I recommend leaving her alone with this?  No.  But with adults watching closely, I think this could be enjoyed by younger kids.  Adult supervision is the key.  The Stomp Rocket comes with the assembly to launch the rockets and four rockets.  They seem bit flimsy, but so far none have broken.  This might not be the most durable toy, but it is fun.  Obviously, youll need a large tree free area to launch the rockets into.  Since we played with it at the park, that wasn't an issue at all.  So I recommend the Ultra Stomp Rocket as a fun toy that will entertain kids of all ages.  Its so simple and yet loads of fun.	1
Gave as a gift for a 3 year old boy. He has no trouble making it take off and loves it.	1
Fun, Fun, Fun !!!!	1
The doors fell off the houses the first time we played with it.  I could understand if my boys were tossing them around the room, but they were actually playing quite calmly with them.  The concept of the houses is so much fun. Sadly, it's too frustrating for a toddler to have the toy fall apart every time they want to play with it.  I tried to contact the company, but so far, no response....	-1
We bought this for our toddler son since he loves, loves, loves to play with our keys and try to unlock doors and such.  He will play with this little set for quite a while and he talks about the piggies and the "woof."  We bought this in conjunction with a book about the three little pigs.  The doors do pop off but are easily fixed and the keys store right in top of the chimney of the biggest house (the other homes & animals nest inside).  It's great!	1
Great gift for growing children who are still learning to draw and color within the lines.  The little girl I got this for loved it!	1
Looking for sturdy paper (more than regular coloring books) to use with my kids dot markers.  My 2 year old loves the book and the pictures.  Simple and gender-neutral pictures to color.	1
The pages are so thick, lines are big and thick enough to see and easy for young ones to stay in lines.  Can be used both with Do-A-Dot Art paint and crayons.  These should be recommended more than regular coloring books for young children.	1
This book is overprice, It is JUST A SIMPLE COLORING BOOK!!Nothing special about it. It is not a dot a dor art book...it doesn't have the circle in the pictures to use dot a dot art. I am very disapointed!! It is just waste on money and time. I am tired of being lied as a customer. If I want a coloring book I can get one in any store in town for less than $3. I was lloking for a dot a dot art book not for a simple coloring book! I went online and find cool printables for dot a dot art activities for free. Im sending this COLORING book back!!	-1
Got this for my grandson for his Easter basket.  It was a hit right off the bat!  Not only with my grandson but my grand daughter and the adults also.  Everyone was seeing how high they could make it fly!  Our only complaint is (and it is a minor complaint) is that the stand kept (keeps) falling off) but it can be fixed in a jiffyit is just a hassle to have the kids stop playing with it so we can put it back together.  Considered gluing it but then it won't fit back in the box for storageThe kids love it and have a great time with it.  I highly recommend it!	1
My students love these rockets and they are easy to put together	1
Great fun. Low quality the rockets break quickly but for the money it lasts plenty long enough and the kids went nuts over over it.	1
good for a 3 year old	1
Grandson is enjoying this!	1
nice big space to color	1
fun coloring book	1
Excellent book, heavy gauge paper.  Kids love it!	1
GREAT!! they actually fly pretty far, 6 year old has a great time	1
Great toy for ages 3 and up.  The Easter bunny brought this for my 3 and 5 year old and they love it.  I've been buying it as a gift for kids.  I would recommend duck taping the plastic together b/c it does come undone.  After the third time of putting it back together I had to tape it.  Now I can just watch.  Don't play near the roof of house or trees.  The arrows get stuck.	1
Great pictures,  but very over priced for what you get.	-1
Received as expected in a timely fashion.	1
it really is just a glorified coloring book. BUT.. it's worth the extra money for the thick pages and because the lines are, in general, big enough to fit the dot a dot markers. If it were a real coloring book, the spaces might be smaller and frustrating for kids.	1
Great for teaching your little one to color in the lines. Our son loves these books! We recommend them. They are great with crayons too!	1
Good quality paper so the do a dot markers don't leak through.  It would probably be a better value if there were more pages, but hey, there's a page count in the description. I knew what I was getting.  Cute pics for kiddos.	1
I found this a nice variation from other ways to color and just know my grand daughter will love this new way to her of coloring	1
Three year old loved toy.	1
Like most toys now-a-days don't expect a ton of quality, BUT... this toy seems to have a good combination of quality and cheapness. It is worth the money and we had fun for hours.	1
this was a gift for my Godson	1
5 Year loves this product, its highly rated for a reason	1
Very entertaining for the 5 yr old i purchased them for.	1
My grandson two grandsons play with this toy a lot.  I would recommend it.	1
great	1
I use them for my RC model aircrafts	1
I use it on my Balsawood planes	1
One of my sons bought this for his air burst rocket.  They worked well and he was happy with the purchase.	1
I teach science and use the air rocket as a prop with my students.  In this unit they all want to "blast" or launch the rocket.  We use lots of the white boosters and when we purchased a new air pump have started to use lots of the red.  As they usually shout when the rocket takes off...WOW!!!	1
These are fantastic for Air Burst rockets.  I like that you can decide what kind of power you want.  These rockets get amazing distance and don't require any type of ignition.  Fantastic for kids or adults!	1
Great for modeling	1
Does delicate planing of balsa and basswood very well.  It doesn't use standard single-edge razor blades so you should get a spare blade when you get started or invest in a soft honing stone.	1
good one.	1
I have no idea how this product got 4 plus stars out of 1,000 plus reviews. And I only give it 2 instead of 1 star bc of the fun factor. It is soooo poorly made, a piece broke (part of the flimsy base) when my husband was putting it together today.  You literally have to sit and hold the base and hose for it to work properly. My friends son had one that was WAY better so shop around, there's better out there. I was hoping this one would be the same but was extremely disappointed. It should cost $5, not $15. It was really a waste of $ but not sure I'll return it bc the kids are having fun with it. DO NOT BUY.	-1
I bought this for my 6 and 4 year old grandsons. They had a blast with it. It's not something I expect to last a really long time but was worth the price. I probably will be buying another one.	1
Works well.	1
rockets!	1
Excellent	1
Ok. If you're buying (or have bought) a William Mark Corporation Air Burst Rocket, buy these. This toy is so awesome you'll want to launch it over and over and over again. And you need these boosters to launch your rockets. Cheap fun. But quality fun.	1
Kids love these. They are easy to use. My 2 and 4 year old sons have tons of fun with this and don't need my help. Even if the stand isn't always working, they just use the tube and shoot the rockets around the yard.	1
Worked great after we zip tied the base together. Before that we had trouble getting it to stay together. The rockets shoot very high and even my two year old can get them to shoot	1
bought this for my sons 3rd b day we all love it my 3 year old can not get it really high but he does not way that much but my 4 year old can get it up there pretty good and me and my husband jumped on it and it did fine we all have a blast with it	1
Kids have a blast with this!	1
Best toy ever. My kids play with it indoors and out and so far it hasn't broken. My 3 year old even figured out how to use it.	1
grandkids	1
Stand stinks! Really it sucks! This rocket goes NOWHERE NEAR 200 feet! I'd say 20 feet at most!  What peeves me most is the kiddo saved his allowance for this piece of crap and he's really disappointed.	-1
Lots of fun!  Our kids are always dragging it out into the yard and have a blast trying to catch the rockets as they come back down!	1
I have bought several of these as birthday gifts for my kids friends and they really enjoy playing with them.	1
we have had these for years. The kids all love to play with it.	1
Kids love it	1
A definite attention grabber at the park.	1
Hours of fun!!!	1
The fins fell off after a month or so but that was due to constant usage. Kinda cheaply made but decent and the kids had fun with it.	1
My sons and nephews loved these. If you have rough boys, they won't last long but are fun for awhile :)	1
For my Grandsons 4 year birthday.  He loves it.  Empowering	1
Gave this as a Christmas gift to a 6-year-old neighbor. He and his sisters and my daughter played with it for hours - even though they all had received various electronic game options for Christmas. It's a blast!	1
Do not buy this.  They do not work and are cheaply made	-1
How could this not be fun for any kid?  This was given to a 6 year old and he had tons of fun playing with it and played with it outside and inside his home.	1
This thing will not stand up unless you modify it some. It's been in the closet since the week after we bought it in December. My grandson is just not interested. Save your money	-1
What a great outdoor toy - even in-door if you don't mind getting your ceiling marked up.  My grandson is one and a half and about 22 pounds and even he was able to stomp and get the rocket to fly.  We've had a lot of laughs with this toy.  I just wish the base was a little more stable.  It can easily fall over which makes it a little difficult for the little ones.  But overall, a great toy.	1
was fun while it lasted. kids got a few stuck on the roof. probably on purpose. they loved to bring it to the park and challenge other kids to see who could get it the highest.	1
great fun for young and old	1
great toy. I have ordered these before and the kids (of all ages) always likes them.	1
Fun!	1
Was a gift	1
Cheap, hours upon hours fun at the park. Very easy to use. My kids are 5 and 8 and they both love it.	1
Because if you can only buy ONE Star Wars figure, THIS IS THE ONE!!!!! This is a VERY hard to find figure. I found only 12(nine since I bought three) in my local Wal-Mart. The Clone Commander(Clone ARC Commander) has to be THE BEST figure ever. The Clone Commander has 20 POINTS OF ARTICULATION!!!!! The Clone Commander can be put in ANY pose and is VERY durable(some say that his hands can come out, but if you are lucky, you will receive one that has its hand firmly in.) The Clone Commander comes with a rifle(that stays in his hands), two blaster pistols(both of which stay firmly in his hands also), a removable waist cape/belt, a visor that swings 180 degrees, holsters on his belt that HOLD THE PISTOLS FIRMLY,  a string that can be attached to any two items, and a hook shaped club (that you place in one of the Clone's hands and place the hook part OVER the string to have him swing down the length of the string.*pant* *pant* Did that make sense?? You'll figure it out.). The Clone Commander has very detailed paints and is A MUST HAVE for ANY Star Wars fan.	1
This is a fabuluos toy!  A must have for collectors who want to complete their clone army!	1
my nephews LOVED THIS. It's the one christmas present they are still playing with at least once a week. It works well and provides entertainment for the whole family. Even the adults want a turn. Plus it makes them run and burn off energy.	1
Part of gift for 8 yr old boy	1
11 year old loved this.... Keeps him & his friends entertained!	1
Absolute blast! Pun intended. Truly fun for all ages. My 2 year old daughter loves this as much as my 6 year old son. Older neighbor kids flocked to it and were not delicate in any way, shape or form, but the stomp rocket survived and is still in great shape!	1
as expected	1
Works well, can be a little wobbly but still loved by my kids.	1
A fun, little last minute gift for Christmas.  It really gets up there!  Fun entertainment for the kiddo.	1
a super toy	1
This is a great gift; however, as was warned by previous reviewers the base needs a redesign.  Worry not, with some Duct Tape you can fix it yourself. It simply needs further reinforcement to stay together during stomps.	1
My son loved this when he got it. He is 12 years old and enjoyed playing with it. I only give it four stars, because the newness seems to have worn off. It hasn't been played with much again since he got it.	1
a lot of fun	1
These are great. Came pretty much as you would expect for this product. I was worried the foam rockets would show up bent but they did not. This was a big hit but definitely needs to be used outside.	1
Wish it was a little sturdier construction but love it.	1
gift for grand sons said they are having fun with it.	1
I have never seen any toy that all ages liked I got this for my Granddaughter for Christmas And my other Granddaughter ,my son ( THIER FATHER ) my husband ( pop- pop ) took this down to the park late Christmas Day , and all four of them where having a great time Also there were some older boys ( my granddaughters are 6 & 8 ) at the park and they saw them playing so then there were 6 of them having a ball I was very happy I picked this gift It is a big hit	1
This is a great toy. My grandchildren  (ages 3 and 6) both enjoy making the rockets fly indoors and outdoors. Since the rockets are made of nerf-like material, they don't hurt anything.  Would  give it 5 stars, but the stand that comes with the stomp rocket is a pain.  It falls apart way too easily.	1
My 5 1/2 year old son loves this. I've watched him adjust the angle, the force, etc. He's learning physics and doesn't even know it. Awesome.	1
awesome, shoots high, kids love it, buy more rockets for ones that get there fins broken, great price, and it gets you outside	1
My son who's 9 got this for his bday.  He loves it. And on a nice weather day, on a beach or at a park, he can play with this for quite a while without getting bored. In the yard where we have trees, he gets frustrated because the rockets keep getting stuck in trees or on our roof (we have a split level).  My daughter who is 4 also likes it, but can't get it as high as my son because you need a bit of strength to get it to go high.	1
This is a gift and it has not been given.  It will be a birthday present.  Will write more after it is given.	1
This is the best!	1
I purchased this figure for my little brother and he simply loves it,I also enjoy using this amazingly detailed figure for my stopmotion video. I love this figure he is really nicely made and comes with alot of blasters. thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
So much fun with grandkids	1
Loved this!  Adults had so much fun with the tou.  Will need to get another for the kids to play with!	1
I didn't know they still made these, but I was so happy to see they do...and that they still have the original design. I cannot believe how far they can fly: 400' if you throw it well.	1
We were missing some piece to snap the base together but we were able to play with it without it.	1
kids loved them	1
It's an x-zylo with tiny glow sticks.  X-zylo is a cool toy, this is lame.  I thought it had LEDs or something.  There was nothing in the description at the time I bought it to make me think otherwise.  Still, as a throwing toy, it's fun.  Id recommend the original though, as this has tiny holders for the glow sticks which could disturb flight.	-1
Great fun for all involved, we used some heavier duty tape to really secure the launching "pole" piece together just to be on the safe side with all those small feet stomping and not the best aim ;)	1
This is the second stomp rocked we've owned.  The first one was the standard and my kids used and abused it for a year before it finaly broke apart.  So far so good with this one and the rockets go pretty high.	1
Great	1
As a kid, I made "chinaberry shooters" (PC for guns).  This works on the same principle (air pressure projectile).  It, however will not 'put somebody's eyes out'.  It is actually fun and safe for this old man, the Grands the kid next door (and her mother).  Because of weather, I have allowed limited use indoors without any damage.  Go with the LED refills because the non lighted become useless as dusk approaches.  I have one 'con'.  The launch tube holder is not very good (it was better when I staked it).  Thanks to indoor use, we have found holding and pointing the launch tube both safer and more fun.  WILL BUY AGAIN!	1
I bought two of these for two boys, one four years old and one seven years old. They both loved it, and the adults had fun with the rockets, too.	1
I bought this for my 3 year old great-grandson for Christmas.  His dad set it up for him at our New Year's Eve party since I couldn't give it to his son until then.  It was the perfect toy that night because there were 2 other boys there, one was 4 and the other 7 and they all loved playing with it.  It shoots very high and the nice feature is that it is soft and won't damage anything.  They had fun stomping on the pump.	1
So cool!! My grandson's love this toy.  They play for hours with this one.	1
Thank you!	1
the stomp rocket was a great hit with my grandsons, they can play in and outdoors with it	1
It's a good toy.  But what they don't tell you is unless your kid weighs 120 lbs he's not going to get this very far in the air.  I really wanted to like this too.  But by the time my son is big enough to get the rockets up high he'll outgrow it,  it just isn't that interesting to watch the things fly up 15 foot.  Other than that I like it	-1
I gave this to a 9 year old boy who loved it.  And, his father loved it too - in fact, he was the one who stomped the first two rockets into the air (and promptly lost them in the snow, we never found them, they went up super high and we didn't see them come down.)  So, it's a good thing I bought the set with the two extra rockets.  This set delivers what it says it does - the rockets soar amazingly high.  I think any kid would love this.	1
kids love it	1
This was a gift for my 7 year old nephew. He loved it. As did all his uncles. I'm not sure he got to play with it much at the family party. But I'm sure he loved it once he got it home and all to himself. :)	1
Returned it. Lame toy.	-1
GREAT PRICE	1
Very Happy	1
good quality,	1
Children and adults enjoyed these!  Big hit!  Nonna buys the coolest stuff was overheard.	1
This was the hit of Christmas for the whole family.....2 year olds, 4 year olds, 6 year olds, 16 years, and even the adults!!	1
My son ... and dog loves this ... well, they loved it ... well, my dog loved it too much.  :-)	1
Fun	1
A real hit at Christmas.  I just wonder how long they're going to last .....	1
I bought this for my son's 6th birthday. Everyone (young and old) LOVED it!!! We bought a few more to gift at christmas, and we received the lightup rockets for christmas! Yay!	1
Happy with purchase. Great product.	1
Not the best quality but it didn't matter. The kids loved it and it worked great. Didn't measure if the advertised "200ft" was accurate...but who cares the kids love it!	1
Kids loved, very durable, even at the beach	1
My 7 year old still plays with this. Only have had one rocket break due to hitting an electric line.	1
Got a pretty good reaction from my 10 year old niece. She was excited to open it up at our holiday gathering and play with it on the spot.	1
Works great, and I sent a couple out as gifts.	1
make sure you play with this rocket in a large empty field, it really goes up.	1
Super gift for any child over four.	1
Great outdoor activity.  Very good quality.	1
Fun toy, kids love it!	1
We love these but they never last	1
Sent this to my 6-year old grandson and he loves it!	1
what I expected	1
My 9 year old grandson loved it--tons of fun!	1
cant wait to use it this summer!!	1
Kids FAVORITE Present of the year!	1
the kids love to stomp and see who gets the most distance-  has to be used in open area cause it gets caught in trees  a great toy	1
great present for my grandson	1
3 year old loves it.  lots of fun and easy to use. Do need to tape the stand so it stays together.	1
Fun! No bells or whistles. Kids love it and take turns! It flies high and even little ones can make it work, if they have enough weight behind the stomp. But they love trying, all the same, and usually get it to fly eventually!	1
This present for our 4 and 6 year old grandsons was a huge hit!  In fact, the adults at the party also had a great time "stomping" the launcher to send the rockets into space.  I was impressed that Amazon added the refills at such a great price and loved the fact that it is a toy that does not require batteries/  I'd recommend this to anyone.	1
Didn't get to actually see this in action but my daughter in law said the grandkids had great fun with this and it really did go WAY up in the air!	1
Quick and easy assembly (2-3 minutes). Easy to use right away. Even our tiny 3 year old was able to make the rocket shoot a tiny bit into the air. 7 year old boys jumping onto the pump had the rockets soaring! :)  Quality wise, it seemed to hold up to birthday party use very well, even with some exuberant children. The materials, however, are a thin plastic (and, of course, foam for the rockets), so I'm not sure how long it will last. My guess is given the amount of use, even though it's not incredibly sturdy, it'll last quite well.  UPDATE: 6 months later, kids still LOVE it! It's holding up to typical play. My only complaint is the tripod that it rests on. It seems to be lasting well, but it sometimes pops apart mid play and I have to put it back together. Makes for compact storage, but I wish they'd add a more substantial option so my kids wouldn't need to get me to fix the tripod for them before they play.	1
One of the best boy gifts you can give.  Stomp on the plastic pillow and watch the rocket soar.  See if you can catch it on the way down.  Easy to use and loads of fun!  Make sure you invest in extra rockets in case they get stuck in a tree!	1
Love this thing	1
I very rarely give 1 star reviews, because usually there is something redeemable about it. Unfortunately, not in this case. I had an original stomp rocket back when I was 13 that was produced with high-quality materials. This is made of INCREDIBLY CHEAP plastic, tubing, etc. This may be one of the most disappointing products I have ever seen, compared to what it used to be. Ironically, I contacted my mother and she had the original one in her basement. I had her ship that to me, and it still works as good as it did 15 years ago!  The version that I just purchased through Amazon is a complete waste of money.  Before my mom told me she still had the old one, I seriously contemplated going to Lowe's and building my own. I strongly suggest buying the rockets, but building one yourself. It will be a fun project for you and your kids, and it will be a far superior product for not too much more money.	-1
Gave it to three nephews. Big hit with each!	1
Kids love it just wish the base was more sturdy but besides that they spend hours outside	1
love it	1
My children love this chipmunk along with the barn owl and guinea pig.  They have others but these three are their favorites.  My only complaint is the chipmunks nose is sunken into it's face.  I have tried to manipulate it to get it out but it will not budge.  My children haven't noticed so this is only a small defect.  Very cute otherwise.	1
I purchased four Folkmanis finger puppets for my little boy when he was about 2 1/2 years old and now he's almost 4. We have the white mouse, the brown mouse, the chipmunk and the barn owl. The white mouse and the brown mouse are our favorites. He loves these little animals. They come out for bedtime stories and special occassions. They have helped with counting and other things as well.  The white mouse is great when reading the book "Goodnight Moon" which has a small white mouse in it. The brown mouse was his version of Remy after Ratatouille came out on video. Both have held up to many hours of fun and play. These little finger puppets are well made and so adorable.  If you have yound children or work with young children, any one of these would make a great hit with the them and makes story time really come to life.	1
Good toy for little ones	1
Kids loved it, played with it for hours. Don't know how long it'll last under repeated use, but it's served its purpose this summer.	1
Great birthday gift	1
very cute made finger puppets	1
Looks exactly as shown. Life sized. Good educational toy for tots!	1
Kitty loves carrying it around, kicking it and tossing it in the air. We call it his 'kitten'. Always know when Smokes has it in his mouth as his meow is muffled. He also loves his squirrel.	1
CUTE	1
All children need a stomp rocket.  Great toy!	1
fun!  the kids loved it!	1
Kids love it!	1
Great to Have such a Toy ..So Much Fun	1
A lot of fun and very cute.	1
This was given to my son last summer (he was 2) by a family friend. It quickly became one his favorite toys and had to be with him for napping or sleeping. I should add that my son is and never has been very into stuffed animals. He has about four stuffed animals (including this one) that he likes and that sleep in bed with him and the rest he never even looks at. When he's awake, he doesn't even really play with his favored stuffed animals much, but they do sleep with him.  We recently lost this toy (he is now 3) and he missed a couple naps because he didn't have his toy. I was so glad to find it on Amazon and to be able to have fast shipping with Amazon Prime.  I would agree with other reviews that the picture attached to this listing is not an accurate representation of the toy, but the user photos are.  I think I'm going to have to buy another in case the new one gets lost.	1
Bought this for my grandson who is an infant. He absolutely adores them! Took a cardboard box and cut out a puppet theater, added curtains and bought seven puppets to start this off! Great gift and entertaining! You can teach them so much more with puppet shows then reading books or audio video cd's and dvd's!	1
Simply adorable for the grand kids.  If it is not on a finger we are hiding and seeking in the house.  The mouse us especially cute too.	1
Fun for my granddaughter and our puppet collection. Helps great imagination play time. Great for story telling. Easy to pocket and pop out for play.	1
All Folkmanis puppets are great.  My kids especially like the finger puppets.  They are made to look realistic and they always use quality materials.	1
Great!	1
My niece loves animals and wanted some little critters for Christmas.  I ordered 7 different Folkmanis animal finger puppets and they are all very cute and great quality.  She will LOVE them.	1
I bought these for my 2 grandsons. They love them. For the money its a great outdoor toy. Lasted much longer than I thought they would. They been shot on the roof and into pine trees. Some we had to wait for the wind to get them out. When they visit they play with them.	1
very unhappy defected product	-1
Take it to the park and play with your kids for hours. This is a great  product and pretty durable. The rockets lasted longer than we thought they would.	1
Even my grown kids have fun with these.	1
We love our Rocket the base needs to be super glued to stay in tact but over all a cool rocket.	1
product is difficult to put together...even for an adult.  the stand pieces don't really fit together and then fall apart very easily so it ends up taking two people to play (one to hold the mechanism and one to stomp on it which is really only fun for kids with great gross motor skills.	-1
My 3yr old loves it	1
Lots of fun.  Kids LOVE this.	1
Nothing quite like family time together, going outside and stomping on this thing!  Lots of fun.  Even my husband enjoyed it.  We took it camping and it was very entertaining.	1
Cheap Plastic.  Rockets don't lsst long.  Be careful pointing this thing, can take an eye out!	-1
Concept is great, but the apparatus that frame that holds the the rocket for take off is soooo flimsy. We've gone through 3 of these now.	-1
grandson loved it.  worth it!	1
They had a lot of fun with these, however the rods fall apart really easily. We had to duct tape one of ours together and the other one that we bought we will possibly glue. They don't stay together well.  They were extremely fun and the kids LOVE them. We got around the fact that they don't stay up by having the kids angling and shooting them in different places while trying to hit "circles" or targets. It was fun.  I don't know if it's just mine that were falling apart or not, but they were still fun.	1
ALSO MORE JUNK!!	-1
Ultra (200 ft) or Jr (100 ft) Stomp Rocket? I went for the Ultra for my kids and it was such an awesome experience. None of us have a clue if it shot up 200 feet. But it did shoot up and went really high. Great toy that caught everyone's attention and had everyone wanting to try it.	1
these really fly	1
Not the best quality, but the kids LOVE it! It's always the hit when we're camping.	1
I did not get to try this product because I sent it to my granddaughter. Her and her father love this toy. I would recommend it to others who like to see things propelled into the atmosphere.	1
three year old grandson LOVE it.	1
Awesome toy for my 5yr old.  They shoot easily 30 ft high.	1
Fun	1
What every boy needs! :)	1
Entertaining for my 3 year old (for about 15 minutes). Worth buying	1
This is a great game for the around-K age group and kids have a lot of fun and a great workout launching rockets in the air and then collecting them. However, I found the plastic connect-3-legs base to be very flimsy and the launch pipe is held supposedly straight up by a single screw - and with just a little bit of a pull the kids can move it from vertical to an angle and launch the rocket into the neighbor's fenced yard. So, one star off because I had to employ duct tape liberally to strengthen the base connections and make sure the launch pipe stays vertical at all times. I wish they'd ship a more substantially weighted base.	1
Grandson stomped and stomped on the air chamber. He really enjoyed the rocket. He played with it for hours. He only stopped playing because it got dark on our camp out. Would recommend very enjoyable	1
My grandson really enjoys this toy.	1
This is a Great present for Boyd or girls at any age. My kids are 7 and 10 and still like playing with it.	1
Hours of fun for my kids.  I highly suggests that you purchase the extra rockets!  A few got stuck on our roof!  It's amazing how high hey go.	1
These are so much fun we've bought them again and again to give away as birthday presents.  My son played with these for the first time when he was 2 and he's continued to have a blast with them ever since.  We bring them to the park all the time and All the kids come over and join in the fun.	1
Great fun for the money!  Yes, they are flimsy and will need replacing after a while, but they are really fun.	1
My grandchildren loved this toy, and when I checked back with their mom after a couple months, she said it was sturdy!!  I would recommend purchasing extra rockets as they do sometimes decide to land on the roof, but considering they live in tall, two story condos, I'd say that's a positive factor!!	1
This is a great toy.  Not very expensive and the kids loved it!	1
One of the two Stomp Rockets I bought was terrific. No complaints, it was a hit with the Grandkids. The second kit was a disaster. The RED AIR pouch that you jump at to make the thing fly was completely closed up. A manufacturing defect!!!!!! It should have been noticed at the factory if they had a quality control person but I am sure they do not have enough 13 year olds to do that job. I had to use a drill bit to make an air passage into the RED POUCH. I will say that was a bad experience.	-1
Hours of fun, kids loved it. I bought extra rockets with LED for night use.	1
All the grandkids love it.  The extra rockets with LED lights are worth buying as well.  Every adult in the family tried for highest launch honors and it has so far held together perfectly.  Instead of using the lightweight plastic base I drove a wooden stake in the ground and screwed the launch tube to that.  Perfect!	1
We have tried several stomp rockets and my kids love this one the most. The rockets are lightweight enough to blast high into the air, and the foam red tips make them fun and less painless to catch on the way down (or they bounce instead of getting ruined). If left out in the sun too much, the yellow shaft part becomes brittle and will crack or break, so I recommend getting plenty of refills. Four rockets lasted us about 2 years, with lots of friends and neighbors having fun with it too. Even kids who are rougher with the stomper never managed to break it.	1
Lots of fun but be ready for it to come apart easily.  I bought if for my grandson who is going in 2nd grade. He does fine with it.  Just falls apart easily	1
My 4-year-old son is obsessed with this thing and has been for a couple years now.  It's brilliant.  The only downside is that the launcher itself is very, very flimsy.  Do yourself a favor and build a launcher with some PVC and elbows from a hardware store.  This has provided endless hours of fun for my twins (boy and girl alike).	1
What a great toy. My 2 year old grandson loves it. Heck, I love it. The rocket will go as high as they claim. The good news is that a toddler can only launch it about ten feet. At his age this is still an inside toy.	1
I got this as a gift for a 5 year old, but it was an object of fascination for both his 3 year old sister and my one year old son as well. The base kept coming apart, but a little duct tape fixed that. The rockets get some serious distance, often landing on neighbors' roofs. Better to be used in a pretty wide open space.	1
The rockets fire high, however someone has to hold the base because it won't stay together AND the fins on the rocket began to break on the first day.  Great concept.  CHEAP DESIGN.  Recommend another brand!	-1
My sons (as well as my husband and I) LOVE our stomp rockets! Everyone between the ages of 2 & 92 who comes over loves it too!	1
The grand kids really like this and enjoyed it very much. It was a good idea.  I am so glad I got this because did not think they would like it but they did.	1
The tripod won't stay together. Assemble it and it falls back apart. The fins come off of the rockets after not too many launches. It's a shame it wasn't better engineered it was fun while it lasted (10 minutes).	-1
My whole family has a great time with this toy and we have given a few as birthday presents.  The rockets do fly amazingly high.  The negative about this product is it is cheaply made.  But it does not cost much so you get what you pay for.  The stand is annoying and falls apart easily.  I have tried another type of stomp rocket and also a different brand, and all have terribly designed stands.	1
The Stomp Rocket has been a hit with all of my kids (7,5,2).  The toddler can set it up by himself and when he stomps on it the rockets don't fly too far away.  It can keep a toddler occupied for a long time!	1
A couple years ago, my boys got a different version of one of these for a birthday present and even the adults were entertained. Eventually, the parts broke/wore out so this year, we ordered this one for our son's 5th birthday. The 2 extra rockets are definitely worth it as these things fly high enough to wind up on the roof at least once a day.  My boys (ages 7, 5 & 2) and their friends have endless fun with these! The rockets are more durable than the older style ones and the fins stay on them better. The soft rubber tops are soft enough to not hurt at all when they inevitably come down on someone's head (like... say... a 2 yr old brother who wants to get in on the action). And, it's easy enough to use that even said 2 yr old can stomp on it enough to launch it a few feet in the air.  The one con is the stand that hold the rockets. It comes apart way too easily so I just duct taped it together - problem solved.  For the price and durability, there's nothing out there that can even come close to holding the boys' attention like this can!	1
My grandsons really wanted them for his birthday, He said it was the bestest birthday gift, Grandma did real good.	1
We graduated to the Ultimate Stomp Rocket after kids out grew the Stomp Rocket Junior.  A really fun toy, the kids burn a ton of energy blasting them off then retrieving them.  Even the 'big kids' like these.	1
My kids can spend hours playing with this thing. Not many more words to say about it beyond their enjoyment.	1
This is the kind of toy that a kid will really like for a little while - but after 'stomping' for a fairly short time - maybe 15 or 20 minutes, it's time for the kid to move on.  This is easy to set up - a little flimsy to use, but doable, and is durable enough for a number of uses.  Better used with a little supervision.  Use it for a little while, and then back in the box.  But just as much fun a couple of weeks later for another 15 or 20 minutes.	1
I got this for my 2 boys- ages 7 and 4.  For the first 15 minutes it was a lot of fun, then the stand kept coming apart and the boys were getting frustrated that they had to put it back together all the time.  Then 2 of the rockets landed on the roof (they probably should have launched away from the house in a clearing). By the end of about 2 hours the stand was apart, all the rockets were lost or broken and the kids totally lost interest.  If the parts were of better quality it would have been a great toy.	-1
I wish you could have seen the smile on my great nephew's face when this gift arrived.  I got a special message with a picture.  He couldn't wait to get outside and try it out.	1
My four year old rambunctious grandson can't seem to get enough of this safe outdoor toy.  A handful of parents have asked me where I got it :)	1
My nephew thought it was the perfect gas tank. He wanted to fill up everyone and everything. His cousins loved aiming at everyone and shooting the "rockets" at their grandma, grandpa, etc. No one was injured. They're soft. It's hard to hit a target. They get stuck on the roof. We bought extras. It was fun to see who could launch them the farthest. The little ones (two and three year olds) jumped it but got it to work.	1
Got this for my grandson, he works very nice, him and his dad love to go out into the meadow and blast the rockets off.	1
These rockets are cheap and they provide plenty of entertainment for my two kids. My only complaint with it is that the launch legs are poorly designed. They rarely stand up and they constantly fall apart. I ended up super gluing the legs together and they work slightly better now.	1
Gets kids outdoors, exercising running to fetch between launches. Fun for kids. Keeps them entertained for hours! Teaches them science.	1
gift	1
We "stole" this idea as a go-to boys' birthday party present...they all seem to love it.  I'm sure some girls would too, but in my anecdotal experience, the boys love jumping on the "launch" part and watching the rocket go flying!	1
I couldn't really get the stand to stay together so I just sat there and held it while the kids, 3 & 6, stomped and chased the rockets. Hours of fun and daddy volunteered to be our target. The rocket soars nice and high and pretty far when aimed forward.	1
Lots of fun for my 9 year old.  Only complaint is that the screw to hold the rocket to the launcher comes off easily and can get lost:)  A spare nut and bolt would be perfect!  Great toy!	1
These are great being that they can also safely be used in water. They are small enough to bring a few in the diaper bag. My son likes them, not his favorite but if it's the only toy around, he'll play with them. He got them just before turning 1, now 16 mos, hasn't been particularly attracted to them. Though my dog has. My biggest complaint is that the plastic is very thin and soft like so the second my dog puts it in his mouth just to carry around, it's been totaled.	1
Got these for my 21mo son.  He has a field day with the cars and trucks and train and train attachments.  He isn't too keen on the 2 boats that make up the #14-#15 of the chubbies set.  I got the mini one which is smaller in length.  The plastic is a soft plastic like the soft rubbermaids for ice cubes.  True it's kind of thinner than I expected like previous reviews, but I'm glad he hasn't chewed through it yet. And he loves to chew. Its plain, no noise no sound so he uses his imagination to make sounds.  He has matchbox cars and other Cara but he loves these best. He is a plane fanatic, so he hasn't played with e planes or helicopter much.  He has a daron southwest planes that flashes lights and sound and a green toys huge plane, so he plays with those more.  But at least once a day, he brings out his planes to play front the Viking box.  That's good enough for me.  He will probably play with them till he is 5 or goes to school, but it is all worth the while seeing him happy. The wheels moves quickly and smoothly over my hard wood floors so, that's a plus.  The soft plastic prevents too much pain when he bangs his cars on the poor doggie or his own head.  So all in all, it's good.  Attached is pic of 3 Viking toys, his mutchkin snack container and 2 caterpillar toys and green toys plane for size.	1
they are played with and holdup well..	1
Very durable products, but kids aren't interested in playing with it. Too bad.	1
I bought the regular rocket kit for my 5 year old nephew and the junior glow kit for my 3 year old nephew, but they ended up just both using both of them apparently. They LOVED them according to the video my brother sent me of them stomping on them and watching them fly :)	1
We had Easter at our house with 6 grandchildren under the age of 8.  When I gave them these Stomp Rockets they loved them and the children were kept busy competing with each other all afternoon.  I did not think they were flimsy like some of the reviews say, if the kids had an afternoon of fun then I think the toys are great!	1
I get these as a present for any boy about ages 5-7. Always a hit. And the parents love to play with it too!	1
My toddler loves them and separating the kinds of transportation. The other good things I have noticed they are different main colors and different quantity like 1 front load, 2 boats, 3 helicopters and 4 for train with wagons, 5 cars. Boats float in the water, the special spacer for cars wheels, which would last for long. In general good quality toys.	1
Especially given the steep price, I do not recommend this set of vehicles. They are OK-- colorful, diverse pieces, but why would any one child need 15 of these??? If you have twins or triplets or run a daycare for 1 year olds this is the perfect item. Otherwise no need for this!	-1
Okay for a 1 year old or under, but older than that ...... Boring.  They can be chewed on since they are dishwasher safe.	-1
Our 15 month old grandson loves this little bucket of boats, trucks and cars!  Good as bath toys as well!	1
This is a really nice little set of toys and I love that its a simple toy with no bells, whistles, music, or lights. Just plain fun. My son has been playing with these for months (he's now 14 mo) and I'm glad I bought them despite what I considered to be a pretty steep price tag. These are definitely an investment as they are pretty indestructible, can go in the dishwasher, and hold up well to heavy toddler abuse. A great buy considering you get a lot in the bucket too!	1
I bought this for my son for his 4th birthday and he absolutely loves it.  We bring it out to the yard or to parks and he loves launching the rockets as high as they can go.  Becareful, on windy days they have a tendency to drift.  I've lost a few rockets to the roof of our house already (they go very high).  The rockets themselves are very soft and well made.  This is also a great gift for Birthdays.  I've bought this for several birthday parties my son was invited too and the kids all love it.  Hours (seriously hours) of fun.	1
After reading the reviews, I bought both the Stomp and Ultra Rockets to compare them. In each case, as others have stated, they go about half the advertised heights. About 50 feet and 100 ft actual height, respectively. I also found the launch pad to be flimsy, but it works. I ended up laying logs on each leg of the launch pad to keep it steady. Besides the rocket shapes and materials, the only difference in the two sets is that the launch tube for the Ultra Stomp is a couple of inches longer than the Stomp tube. That's why the Ultra goes higher. The Ultra Stomp launch tube is black so you can tell it from the Stomp launch tube which is blue. You really need the weight of an adult to get it to go the maximum height. My 2 1/2 year old, 38 pound grandson could not get a rocket from either set to launch with one foot. It was still fun using these sets and will suffice until  the kids are a little older and can use the Estes model rockets with real rocket engines that go 1000 feet.	1
I bought this toy 2 years ago and my kids still play with it once in a while.  They like it and all their friends always think is really cool	1
Lots of fun. Gets the kids moving around. Our base was bent and could not be put together. Called the number on the slip in the box and they sent 2 replacements super fast.	1
I got this for my son for Christmas and it was probably one of his cheapest gifts, but all of the cousins had more fun playing with this than with any other tech toy they received. It is well worth the money, and the adults had some fun with it too.	1
This is great! I bought it as a gift for a friend's son. She sent me a video of him opening the bucket and exploring the contents. It's made of good quality plastic and just great for a 2-year old with a great imagination.	1
My 2 1/2 year old played with these once and that was IT ! He prefers the hotwheels and matchbox cars much MUCH more. This product is better suited for kids under 2 years of age IMO.	-1
Kids of nearly all ages love this. Easy, the only skill required is the ability to jump onto a cushion-like launching pad placed on the ground. Great fun.	1
Bought this for a toddler's birthday party, all of the kids loved it! Even the grown ups had to take a couple of turns on it. One is on the roof of the house and the other two landed at the he neighbor's house. I would order extra rockets if you plan on using this for a birthday party, just in case some of them get misplaced. I think this is the best purchase I've made on amazon.	1
This was given to a 10-year-old autistic boy who absolutely LOVED IT! Easy to use. Great, sturdy product. Great price.	1
With two kids we go to a lot of birthday parties and many times I don't know the kids personally.  I have one in preschool and one in grade school and this is my go to gift for girls and boys in both age groups.  I usually purchase 3-4 of these at a time and keep them on hand for gifts.  So far everyone has loved them. They don't last forever, so even kids who have had them before love getting a new one.	1
I bought this for my nephew's birthday, he and all the kids at the party has such a blast with it, I ordered one for my son too.	1
I bought this for my sons birthday, and my son was so excited that we opened it up and all his friends wanted to play with it, except that it came with the wrong pieces to put it together. Sending back. Bummer.	-1
My grandson loves this toy, and I bought the refills in case he loses one to the roof or a tree!!	1
The frame to hold the launch tube is cheesy.  The launch tube connection to the frame is cheesy.  My kids end up having wars with these things holding the launch tube horizontal since it works so poorly as designed.  Still great fun.	1
These are a cool toy and a great gift for 4 year olds. It is one of my go to birthday gifts.	1
I have bought these a few times for six year olds and they love it!  It's super fun to play outsdie with and every kid I have bought these for loved them.	1
I first purchased these around 1 year old.  They couldn't do much on their own of course, but they enjoyed others in the family playing w/ them & making noises.  What child doesn't enjoy cars, trains & airplanes!  As they grew they were able to start rolling them themselves/etc.  One of my favorite things learned by this toy is "hook" & "hole".  These vehicles click together by what we call pushing the "hook" into the "hole".  The cars & trains have a hook on one end & a hole on the other - I will admit there are a couple that have holes on both ends & is confusing & frustrating, but I try to put those to the side.  There aren't many at all so really I shouldn't even bring it up.  They have to learn which ends are hooks & which ends are holes & then developmentally (note: this will take awhile, but is amazing to watch) learn to put the hook in the hole & push/click them together.  Yes, they will get frustrated b/c they want to be able to do it on their own, but when they do finally do it on their own it is very exciting!  Also, these vehicles are the primary colors so it is a good tool to teach colors.  Vehicles are always fun in general.  These are easily washable in the sink.  And, we've had these for over a year & are still played with.  They aren't a toy that holds their attention very long, but they are cute & fun.  They are also good to put in the bath, but be sure to dry them off as the metal can rust.  Overall, highly recommend.	1
My son has had this set of vehicles for over a year (he's 2.5 years old now). I really debated back when I bought these if they were worth the price. I'm so glad I believed the other reviewers and gave this adorable vehicle set a chance. These vehicles have been in the bath tub, the sandbox and all over our house. They are incredibly durable and clean up really easy, in fact they still look new even thought they've been played with on and off for a year. As a bonus, I don't mind him using them on wooden furniture because the wheels don't cause any damage. I also think it was a great idea by the toy maker to allow all of the vehicles (except the boats) to connect together. My son is just starting to do this on his own and enjoys making long trains. This is a wonderful, simple, durable, non-electronic and open-ended toy that my son has definitely enjoyed.  UPDATE: My son is now almost 3.5 and still plays with this set regularly. We still have our original set of 4 inch vehicles, and have purchased a few more 4 inch vehicles as well as a couple of the 5 inch ones. These are used in his rice box during the winter and out in the sandbox in the summer. This is definitely one of the most long lived and best toys I've purchased for my son.	1
My daughter's been loving playing with cars and trucks at her daycare so I bought her these - I chose this bucket for the many items included (see other review for the different types) - white wheels that won't damage floors, and great price.  Another plus is that the cars, trucks, train, etc all connect together to form one large train set.	1
My 18 month old daughter loves these cars & trucks.  They're great for both boys & girls.  I love the soft, rubber wheels.	1
I just received these today.  My son hasn't played with them since they are for Christmas, but my husband and I opened the bucket to check them out.  There were a couple of things I wanted to mention: I've come to the conclusion that the sets come with random pieces, which is not an issue at all to me, and, quite frankly, I like it that way.  My son's came with: 2 wagons 3 planes 1 train 1 train car 2 boats 1 bulldozer 2 trucks 3 cars, one of which is a completely different style from the other two  The toys seem very durable and roll very easily.  The bucket is a heavy duty typed bucket, not one of those flimsy paper thin plastic buckets, which is a big plus, since part of the appeal of the product, to me, was that it came in its own container.  The only issue that I have with these toys at all is that, though you can attach the train car to the train, etc. the peg/holes that they attach with attach a little too well.  They were very difficult for me to pull apart and I know there is no way that my (at Christmas time) 11 month old son will be able to pull them apart.  It will be awhile still until he understands the concept of attaching the cars together anyway, but, when he does, I don't believe he'll be able to pull them apart once he gets them attached. That, however, is not a deal breaker to me at all, and, so far, I think these are fantastic toys and I am very happy with my purchase and I know, come Christmas, my son will be too.	1
This youngster doesn't agree on anything.  Doesn't like anything.  Very hard to please.  But with this purchase - believe it or not, no complaints.  He's happy and I'm happy!!!	1
We ordered this box of toys for our son's 2nd birthday.  He already had one Chubbie car, and loved it.  We love the bright colors and vehicle variety.  They are quite durable, roll very easily and smoothly, and are easy to clean (hello dishwasher!).  Our one misgiving with this box is that a few of the vehicles have no moving parts; ie no wheels or propellors.	1
This bucket is great! I used to work in an educational toy store and these were always a best seller for us. When my little one turned one I immediately got this set and have been so pleased. The helicopter and airplanes are great because he loves to spin their propellers. The boats are nice because as bath toys. Also, he loves to put his Cheerios in the boats when he's playing with them during snack time. The cars are wonderful because as others have stated, they roll so well and so quietly and most everything can be linked together to form one long train.  Best of all, when he gets his toys filthy,(which is often)I just pop them in the dishwasher. I checked out the Viking web site and they say the paint is non-toxic, the plastic they use does not contain phthalates or any substance which can be considered carcinogenic which makes me feel assured when I give these toys to my son.  Definitely reccommended and I see these being played with for years to come.	1
Both of my boys love these.  As another reviewer said I took a leap of faith based on the reviews that my kids would like these.  I thought they were somewhat expensive (I paid $39) but they have been totally worth it.  The cars/trucks are a perfect size for their hands and it is pretty impressive how smooth they roll.  We have had them in water, sand and all over our house.  I was glad I bought the 15 piece bucket as there is such a nice variety.  They also work with the Megablocks car transporter truck, which the boys also love.  I am always finding these cars, airplanes, helicopter and trucks in it.  They only thing they find difficult is hooking the pieces together, which is a task I sometimes find a little tricky myself, but is a cool option (especially with the train).	1
After 3 years the plastic on the rockets got brittle and cracked and the rockets weren't any good. We absolutely loved it all that time though and replaced it with the stomp rocket jr. glow. I actually think I prefer this one though. I was hoping the foam would last longer (and it might) but the rockets are harder to place on the shaft (odd, since it's supposed to be for younger kids) and they don't go as far.	1
I bought this toy for Christmas for my toddler.  Since it came out of the box almost three months ago it has been hands down his favorite.  The pieces are sturdy and take being thrown, chewed on and sat on.  They are fun as individual toys and linked together.  The plastic box and lid that holds the toys are often as much fun as the toys themselves since you can put things in and take them out and bang on it, put your foot in it, etc., etc.  All of his battery-powered toys bore him in a matter of hours because he figures out that if you push this, that happens.  With this, the entertainment has been endless.  I highly recommend this.	1
Fun! Fun activity year round we get outside and play. The simple things are always the best. Thank you ultra Stomp Rocket.	1
Great outdoor toy for 2 and up. The adults even enjoyed playing with it. I like the rockets that come with this one the best because they don't float away in the wind as badly.	1
All our kids (boys and a girl, ages four to eight) enjoy playing with stomp rockets. When we set it up in a park, other kids come over to take turns, and it becomes a social center. Great value for the money. Four stars rather than five only because the base is inadequate. It falls over, falls apart, etc. We end up having to station a grownup holding it.	1
Your kid will love it. My 2 year old can stomp the crap out of it and it won't break or anything. It goes about 40 feet high, I can stomp it higher, went over to neighbors roof.	1
We bought these for the younger (<5 yo) kids at our family Christmas dinner.  When we got them out, and started playing with them, at first the young kids were having a blast.  We had purchased extra rockets, and I'm glad we did, because that way everyone got a rocket, and they could take turns. After about 2 minutes, the older kids started coming over, they would run and jump and launch their rocket, and then try to catch it before it hit the ground. Soon after that, as you'd expect, a number of the adults were putting that extra helping of turkey to good use, and we all were launching these things.  The unit held up extremely well for getting such heavy use.  The only downfall is really more of a watch out.  We broke a couple of the rockets when they landed on the concrete instead of the grass.  They didn't shatter, they just cracked, so we were still able to use them, but they didn't fly quite as far. Overall, a great toy for all ages.  Everyone that saw it wanted to take a turn, and once they did, they wanted another.	1
My son got this as a gift and LOVES it.  He's 7.  He got extra rockets, too, which was a plus.  We gave this to our neighbor who is a girl as a bday gift.  She was turning 8.  She's an "outdoor girl".  She loves it too, so I recommend this for kids from age 5 or 6 to maybe 10.  Although I ended up playing with it by myself too, so perhaps there's no real age range.  It's really fun.	1
VERY fun toy for even the grown-up men!  The whole family loves this - just wish we had a bigger yard...hahaha!	1
My 5 year old and 7 year old both love this.  We like that you can angle the rockets different ways as well.	1
My nephews were OBSESSED with this toy!  It pretty much ruled our Christmas.  It's easy to assemble, easy to use, and basically indestructible.  All the kids in our family - age 4-12 had a blast.	1
These are fun for even younger children. They say 16, well I believe any age can have loads of fun with these. They say they go 200 feet, well maybe, but they do go far and they sure have a lot of laughs running after the rockets. It's nice to see the kids off the computers and outside having fun. Keep away from the house, or you could lose them on the roof.	1
Oh my goodness! We had a ball with this outside on Christmas day. It soared just as high as the picture on the box displayed. My nephew loved it!	1
This toy is great.  The pieces are very sturdy and easy for little ones to grasp and stack.  This toy is very safe for babies to use.  There is no choking hazard.  You can use this to help with shape and color recognition as well.  It even has a rattling peg, which even the youngest babies would love to hold and shake.	1
This was an instant hit with my 1 year old. Four months later it is still played with daily. He loves to stack the pegs and knock them down. The pegs are large and fit into his hands perfectly. He can stack them 10 high before they tip over. It's also nice for helping him learn his colors.  Overall, a great toy for a one year old!	1
My son loves this toy!  He started playing with it when he was about 8 months old and is now 18 months old and still uses it.  He loves to see how high he can stack the pegs or watches me stack and then takes them down.  It is also great for teaching colors.	1
This toy has been my child's favorite for nearly a year now.  She generally moves from one toy to the next very quickly.  However this toy holds her attention the longest.  It has nice large pegs and is easy to stack.  It is also good to learn colors, counting, sorting, and patterns.  My older child also showed me that you can play a game with it.  I am uncertain of the game's title but it is played like this.  You fill the board with pegs.  Remove one peg anywhere on the board.  Then you use one peg to hop the one next to it on any side, you must move in a straight line (up, down, or diagonally).  When peg is hopped remove it from the board and continue this process.  The object is to have only one peg left.  Who knew this toddler toy could also be enjoyed by older kids.  My children have also played their own made up game my older child tries to build a tower before my littlest one knocks it down.  Each time the challenge is to get the tower taller and taller before it is knocked over.  Fun to watch!  Great toy!	1
I'm not sure how such a simple toy became such a fan favorite, but all my kids seem to really enjoy playing with this! The base is a hard plastic, and the colored pegs settle into holes in the base or on top of the other pegs.  There is one peg that has balls in the middle, the kids love to shake that one. This toy is most frequently made into "birthday cakes" here, and my kids love baking their cakes for me.  So simple, but definitely a keeper!	1
Fourteen month old grandson enjoys playing with this.	1
Great toy for my 1 yr old grandson...he is in between the 'taking things out' stage and the 'putting things together' stage. This toy is great for teaching these skills.	1
Bought the SR for my 6 year old (Christmas 2013), he loves it.  Shoots it in the house and outside.  Lots of fun.	1
It is basically a plastic thing you stomp with tube that goes to yellow sticks that help point the tube to the plastic and foam rocket. The yellow launch pad is flimsy and will fall over but kids can hold the tube, or a grown up can man the launch pad and let the kids stomp. The rockets still launched after being stepped on by kids. My roommate stomp launched it into his head and had it hit my car just to play test it and it turned out fine and due to the foam tip no scratch on car paint and I do not recommend hitting faces on purpose but take comfort in knowing the world does not end if it happens.	1
These were a gift and kid loves it, it could be a little more durable as the base is broken but the rockets do fly!	1
My 14 month old daughter liked these a lot! The pieces are easy for her to grab and stack.	1
My son got this for Christmas last year when he was around 18 months old.  At that time, he just enjoyed trying to put the pegs in the pegboard and didn't seem interested in stacking.  Now, a year later, he stacks the pegs, builds huge, perilous towers and laughs hysterically when they fall down and the pieces scatter.  He now organizes the pieces by color and shape.  He also does a lot of make-believe...he'll pretend he's making ice cream cones or hot dogs.  It's very cute to watch.  This one is well worth the money because it's something my son keeps coming back to and discovering something new to do with.  We love it!	1
It's pricey for a simple toy......but simple toys are the best.  Truly.  Studies have shown that the less bells and whistles, the more a child learns.  This is one of those toys hat starts out simple ( baby chews on pieces) and gets more and more sophisticated.  You can help fine motor ( stacking) gross motor ( tapping the lies together), sorting by color, creating patterns, etc.  really a great toy.  My two year old still likes it.	1
Seems like we received an opened box. The peg board was bent out of shape and the box was simply taped shut with a small piece of tape. All the pieces were loose inside the box. Was very surprised to get it in such condition	-1
My 18 month old daughter loves this toy.  There is not a day when she doesn't get the box and dump all the pieces out for us to play with her.  She enjoys knocking the blocks down more than stacking them, but I'm sure that will change.  And she enjoys it so what the heck - let her knock 'em down!  It's good to help with motor skills as she occasionally will stick a peg in a hole and try to stack one on top.  It is also good to teach colors as we're constantly telling her - "grab the red one" or "get the blue one".  It also has one special block with some beads inside that she loves to shake.  Overall a good buy as she plays with it often.	1
I bought a second Geokid Daisy Maxi for another client.  I find it easy to work on "put in" type tasks, the "pegs" are nice and large (necessary for little ones who put items in their mouths), and the board is flexible.  It is a lovely beginning toy.	1
I bought this to give to a 1-1/2 year old girl that has cerebral palsy, along with other numerous disabilities.  She just loves it!	1
She is very happy to see her new toy. I saw this set in my daughter's daycare and she played it every time we visited the daycare, so I decided to order one. She plays with it for a long time and really enjoyed.  but it is loose. so I give 4 stars instead of 5.	1
Excellent quality, perfect for toddlers, they have fun stacking them and knocking them down. I only wish there was more clear pieces.	1
My daughter had one of these at daycare so I bought one for Christmas and she has a blast stacking these things. its one of her favorite toys.  I was so happy to fine one for home!	1
My daughter has been into sticking things into each other and putting covers on bottles and jars since she was 10 months old.  So we thought that a toy that requires sticking pegs into holes and into each other would interest her - and we were right!  She really likes this toy.  She doesn't spend long stretches of time with it - maybe 5-10 min at a time - but that's ok for a young toddler.  And she keeps coming back to it.  Stacking pegs is almost as much fun as knocking the towers down, and the brightly colored pegs will sure help in color recognition.  I think we have many months, maybe even a year or more, to go with the toy, so I feel it's a good buy and would recommend it to others.	1
My 4 and 6 year old and my 70 year old Motheer all had a lot of fun with this toy! Until ALL the rockets were on somebodys roof or stuck in a tree. :) I see why they sell the extras. Is a great toy but you need those extra rockets.	1
I purchased this for my boyfriends nephew for Christmas. They had so much fun I got one for my nieces, and the super high performance stomp rocket for my boyfriend.	1
This is a wonderful peg set for younger children.  It's very colorful and eye catching.  Because we use it so frequently, it is often in the background of our photos and people are constantly asking what that fun looking toy is.  My son (10 months old) loves to grab the pegs and knock down towers I make for him.  As he grows I know he will enjoy building designs of his own.  The rattle peg is a huge hit and is usually the first thing he goes for in the morning.  We love it!	1
We use this as an alternative to a peg board for my son's speech therapy. My two year old loves it!	1
We have had them for a few years and both of our boys love them. BUT word to the wise do not let your kids play with them in the bath! Our younger son (one year old) Liked to take them in the bath.. This was fine till a few fell in to the potty and we thought we got them all out.. Sadly we missed one and after one flush our potty was killed. Plummer did everything he could to get it out of the S bend but it was not moving. We had to buy a whole new potty. On the bright side it got stuck there and not in the pipes. That might have run us in the 1000's to repair!  So great toy, but keep an eye on where your kids play with them!	1
my 2 year old received this as a xmas gift. I like, and she likes it. Sturdy and you can teach and learn many things. Colors, numbers, sorting etc, also helps to build fine motor skills.	1
My granddaughters at 18 months needed help with their fine motor skills. I was advised to find pegboard or Lego.  I had no idea how hard it is to find either of these for children under two years. However, Italy to the rescue of the pre-twos!! Quercetti GeoKids make a fine circular board with holes and different color pegs to insert and build with. From there you can build up!  The girls love it and play with it often. The pieces are large and colorful, easy to clean and the number of pegs in each color is on the box so you know when to move the sofa and search for missing pieces!! As mentioned, the pieces are large and easier to manipulate than Lego and the girls, now have been able to graduate to Lego which they also enjoy but they still remember and use their GeoKids.	1
My son loves this toy.  It has keep his interest since he was 1 and is now 1.5.  He loves to stack them and knock over.	1
My girls love this, they use it at the park when we go and have a blast with it. Simple but fun. It shoots up about 60+ feet in the air if you stomp correctly. Fun!!	1
This is a great toy to send the kids to play outside the house, in the country or on the beach. Easy to use.	1
My 12 yr old nephew loves it! It was easy for him to set up and it is pretty powerful. He and his friends have a lot of fun with it.	1
Love this toy! So much fun and even easy enough for my 3 year old to use. The stand is flimsy though - we duct taped ours to a batting tee we weren't using so it would be more stable.	1
Everyone loves this stomp rocket both kids and adults equally. It's fun to see how high you can shoot the rocket up in the air. The rockets themselves can break easily so be careful to not step on them. I think we only have 2 rockets remaining. They also teach kids a bit of physics too:)	1
Opened Christmas morning and both kids and adults were in the yard seeing how far they could shoot this thing. This is a great toy for boys and girls, trust me, I observed everyone having fun with it. Very easy to set up and take down and it doesn't take up much room for storage.	1
Everyone in my family loves this.  I have 2 boys, a 4 year old and a 9 month old, and when the 4 year old stomped on it to shoot the rocket,  the 9 month old would cracked up. It is a little tricky to get together,  and the stand does come apart fairly easy,  hence the 4 stars.	1
these work really well I would guess we could easily get 100 feet out of it easy enough that once assembled 4-5 year olds can use it w no issues	1
The price is right and my 18 month old son loves it! When you stomp on this thing it comes out fast. Be prepared to chase these rockets all over the neighborhood cause they really fly.	1
A HUGE hit!! Both my three and five year old love this!! Its always a competition to see who can stop the highest!! Even Mommy and Daddy join in! We have had so much fun with this!	1
My young grandkids had a ball with these on Christmas Day.  Aim them away from roofs so they don't get stuck up on them.	1
This toy is so awesome; my whole family has a great time playing with it! It's easy to operate so even my 2-year-old understands how to set the rocket on the post and stop to set it off. I love how simple it is; no batteries or complicated buttons or parts, but we have tons of fun with it out in the yard. Mom and Dad even get anxious for a turn! :)	1
Gave this to my 12 yr old son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. I really thought maybe he wouldn't like it thinking it was a baby type toy for his age but I was wrong. He really seems to enjoy laughing this thing into the air. Not a bad price for some laughs and giggles on Christmas morn!	1
My son loves this.  We all enjoyed playing it.  So much fun and it goes really high. Definitely recommend this.	1
This is very cheaply made, but it functions pretty well, and my grandson loved it!  It was the most played with toy of the day.	1
Nice little 13 x 21" parafoil nylon kite.  Fabric and materials and stitching are fine. Comes with 500 feet of 50 lb control line. This one does great on a beach breeze or from a boat, and 500' is a lot of altitude.  At $20 shipped, this is a bargain. It's a good kite to introduce a young person to kite flying.  Parafoils do not have any type of rigid frame, so one of their advantages is they compact into a soft drawstring bag. These are easy to toss in a daypack, car trunk or picnic bag.  Portable, cheap and fun. What's not to love?  Hope this is helpful. Happy kiting, everybody.	1
We got this kite at a store by the beach because it was cheap. It is really small and very hard to fly it up. The threads kept tangling and spinning. I have spent most of my time fixing it under very strong wind and hot sun which made it even more difficult. I own 2 others kite and regret buying this kite so I gave it away. DO NOT BUY THIS. If you want to have fun with your little kids, get something simple	-1
My 6 year old grandkids LOVE LOVE LOVE this toy. They shoot a humdred feet or more in the air and land softly and safely !!!  Suggest you find open park area for launching as they really fly high. BEST toy money I"ve spent in a long time. Buy some extyra rockets for non-stop firing.	1
I bought this for fun but also as an emergency signal if I am out hiking and need to signal someone it can serve as a high flying signal.	1
I have never seen my grandchildren (ages 7 and almost 4) have so much fun with a toy!  I thought they'd have to wait for warmer weather to play with it, but with the soft rockets, the Stomp Rocket can be used inside, especially in a long rec room.  The two actually played together, with one aiming the rocket attached to the hose and the other jumping on the air "bladder."  (No batteries!)  They haven't tried the rocket yet using the stand outside.  I warned my daughter to be sure they keep it away from the house and trees or they'll lose a lot of rockets.	1
My son (12) and his friends really enjoyed using this until one of them stomped so hard he broke it.  It's really not tough enough for 12 year olds.	1
I gave this to my son for his fifth birthday, and he LOVES it!  He always wants to take it to the park to use it.  It says it's for older children, but I think it's just fine for his age group.  As a warning, this will attract a crowd at the park, so don't get it if you don't want all the other kids coming to play and wanting a turn.  ;)  The kids love to run and jump on it, and never get tired of seeing how high they can launch the rockets.  Definitely has given a lot of fun for the money.  Other parents ask me where I got this all the time.	1
kids and adults had fun launching and then catching the rockets.  it's not great quality, but we had fun with it for several days and gave it pretty hard use.	1
My daughter and her friends have been playing with this for almost 6 months now and it is still holding up! Good quality! They love to see who can make the rocket go the farthest!	1
A simple toy that is good for hours of fun.  Although rated for older children, I personally let my two-year old use this when supervised.  Although just two, he's able to launch and reset the rocket himself, and gets a big kick out of flying it.  We've been fortunate not to lose any rocket to trees or roofs as yet, and haven't used any of the spares that came with it.  And believe me, if an adult stomps on the air bladder this will really go!  It's relatively robust, and safe to use as the rockets are foam tipped.  It's good, inexpensive, fun for kids.	1
This was a gift for my four-year-old grandson.  He and his brother (8) and parents have had great fun with this rocket which goes really high.  It is defintiely designed to be  used outdoors.	1
Great grandson loved it. This was a birthday present that was well received. Blake loves it and uses at a lot.	1
Very cheaply made would not buy again. The kids liked it but did not last very long! Would not buy!	-1
This is a great toy. I love that it encourages my kids to get outside and be active (chasing the rockets). My two year old is too light to make it go far, but it's still cute to watch her. My five year old loves it. We work on aiming at things or trying to run and catch them. Quality seems good--has held up to my husband (over 250 lbs) jumping on it so I can't imagine my kids ever breaking it.	1
These are fun any day...our new bday gift for all kids 3 and over...girls and boys, everyone loves stomp rockets!!	1
Too fun, really does launch the rockets way up there. I would suggest buying the extra rockets, as unless you are in a very open area, plan on losing a few.	1
the kids love it thanks :) david from lancaster pa :) hi bye see yea out 1234 123 111111 1	1
I bought this toy for my grandchildren ages 2 - 9 and they all loved it.  Even their parents and I had a good time.  The only problem is that you need a big open space to avoid losing the rockets on rooftops or in trees.  I'm hoping the next big wind storm will retrieve our lost rockets.  Great item, lots of fun, good exercise chasing the rockets - and no batteries or electronics!	1
The stomp rocket is our favorite toy.  It keeps our entire family entertained.  This is our go to toy for birthday presents and is always a hit.  The little red wings can fall off easily and the rockets don't fly as high but otherwise, it's a solid toy.  Our boys even launch them at each other and with the foam tips, they don't hurt.  So much fun!!!!	1
I give this as a present often. I like that it doesn't need batteries and gets kids outside to play. The price on Amazon is good as well.	1
My son had one of these (he got as a birthday gift) so we thought we would buy one for my nephewed.  Worked like a charm and something he didn't have!  I would buy again for a birthday gift!	1
The Ultra Stomp Rocket is a phenomenal toy. My friends children loved trying to see who could shoot the rockets higher up in the air. We brought it to the park and all the other kids gathered around to have a turn. Easy to assemble, relatively inexpensive and provides hours of fun for all ages.	1
My girls have loved this. It seems sturdy and as long as you don't play with it in the trees, should last for quite a while. :)	1
See my review on the National Geographic Kids First Big Book of Space (First Big Books) - this Ultra Stomp Rocket was the perfect birthday gift pairing for my 8 year old nephew. Easy to use and tons of BIG fun - it was great to know that even though we are many miles apart, that he knew his aunt and uncle took time to find and send the perfect gift.  We will likely be buying refills for Christmas and are considering the glow-in-the-dark version as well.	1
I bought this for  my son but so far, my husband and his friend have been playing with it more. It's pretty sturdy and worth the price!	1
I received the Ultra Stomp rocket with refills as a gift for my 3 yr old son and have since purchased two more for his friends.  This toy is fantastic and the kids absolutely love it...and the adults too!  You have to take care handling the rockets; if they are bent in any way they might stop working. The tails on the rockets do fall off after some use but it's an easy fix...it's a cheap toy so don't expect it to last forever. But it's definitely a great toy to enjoy and give as gifts. We recommend it!	1
After getting the Ultra Stomp Rocket we put it together in about 50 secs. and started playing with it.  It goes quite high in the air, so best done in the middle of the park or the driveway..	1
I bought this for my great nephew for his 10th birthday.  He seemed to be having a blast playing with it with my 6 year old grandson.  I was surprised that the rockets did not seem to get stuck in some nearby trees.  Don't know if it was just luck or rocket design.  I plan to order another for my other great nephew for Christmas and maybe for my six year old grandson too.	1
my boys and all the kids in the playground just love it, even my 11 year old daughter plays with this!!!	1
Three year old and all her friends loved this at her birthday party. Great toy to use over and over.	1
These are soooo much fun.  My four year old son loves playing with these.  Buying a few extra "rockets" is not a bad idea.	1
This was a gift for my 9 year old and my 5 year old, we went to a parking lot to do this and we had such a blast! they flight really high! We loved it!	1
My 2 year old son and his little friends LOVE this toy. They play with it nonstop. Im going to have to buy another one because they are wearing it out fast!	1
I always wanted one when I was a kid, and never did get one. Now I have a kid and I get to live through them. Thats good for the both of us. Awesome toy!	1
We ordered this product for our 3 grandsons for Christmas. Little boys love things that can be stomped on and shoot. This does both and they are having fun.	1
This rocket was a gift for my son.  He liked it very much.  The harder you stomp on the launch pad the higher it goes up In the air.  This item arrived quickly.	1
granddaughter loves it...outside warm summer days blating it up as high as her pine trees..very innovative product good price  quality made..i wonderful choice for ur young kid..enjoy	1
Who had the most fun?  The 4 year old? The 5 year old? The 7 year old? The 38 year old? The 55 year old?  Never thought we'd be downrange from an artillery station.  The roof of the house quickly became a target,. But, no harm done-just fun.................  Just a great toy! Hilarious.	1
Bought for a 5 yr old played with it for 2 days before he broke it. The toy is good quality but not good for a rough 5 yr old boy, lol	1
I bought this for my 4 year old grandson.  He loves it!!!!! He can shoot it off in the house or outdoors.	1
My 4 year old got this for Christmas. It has been one of the best toys we have had. Every kid that comes to our house loves to play with this (as well as adults.) They like to shoot it up as well as at an angle to try and catch it. The foam head is soft so it won't hurt if you get hit. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a fun gift for kids 4 years and up. It is a great outdoor toy that gets kids outside and running around.  Do note that the plastic base is cheap, but so far has not broken. The rockets are also made of thin plastic and therefore will break if they are stepped on. We've had a few that have broken because of this, but I don't hesitate to replace them because of how much fun they get out of this toy.	1
My grandson loved this rocket which was a birthday gift. He has had a blast with it, playing with it with his friends. Would recommend this to friends.	1
Has held up to several days of abuse,  Kids are having a blast!  I commented to the neighbors how a simple inexpensive toy can be so much fun.	1
ok so one of my daughters for her birthday asked for "different" gifts... the kind that are not main stream. I looked high and low and spent many hours researching gifts for her...she turned 11, and this is what I decided on. Not only did she love it but it was a HUGE party hit as one would stomp and all the others would try to catch. Much more fun than a piata. Just give prizes for who gets it up highest and who catches it. Actually this should be listed under party games because if you are a parent thinking of good party games this is all you need. This will give everyone a turn and is way more fun than being the tiny kid behind the biggest kid in line on the piata .	1
My daughter fell in love with stomp rockets when she was around 2 years old, when some older kids at the beach let her help chase their rockets. I wasn't sure she could operate the stomper so young, so we waited till she was about 3 1/2 before getting her a set of her own. They are a hit! The rockets launcher is great fun to jump on, and chasing down the rockets is a good way to get the electronics generation running around outside. Every time we take these to the park, we end up sharing with a crowd of other kids who want to check out the fun -- I suspect lots of other families have gone home to search out stomp rockets like we did that first day after the beach. (There seem to be lots of choices in that research. I picked one of the cheaper options with good reviews, but I suspect they're basically all the same thing.) Marking down one star because the plastic stand is poorly designed and drives me crazy. And FYI, don't let your dog fetch them -- tooth punctures will let air out the base and they won't fly anymore. Learned that one the hard way!	1
What can I say...this is what the boys wanted for Christmas, and Grandma bought it...of course.  Lots of fun for them, and product seems well made and safe.	1
rugged, reliable, simple fun.  The stomp rockets we've had have stood up to being stomped on.  That doesn't seem too much to ask, but these days it seems to be something you can't count on. I haven't run into anyone of any age so far who doesn't think these are lots of fun.  I'd say they are one of the best toy values.	1
This is always a great hit with little boys for birthday presents. My kids have been through a couple. If they held up better I'd give it five stars but I just figure its worth replacing after a while.	1
5 y.o daughter and 3 y.o. son have a lot of fun with this outdoors. Have eve used inside [nutty]. Appreciate low tech [and soft] design for safe play.	1
Our grandson turned 4 and he loves rockets.  He has several rocket books he reads.  We thought he would like this toy and we were right.  He first used it the traditional way by launching the rockets.  He then decided to carry the launcher and use it to shoot at targets by holding, aiming and then stomping to shoot.  That kept him busy for hours.  It was a great gift for him.	1
My grandson called us (age 5 1/2) telling us that he LOVED this toy!  I don't know the difference between the ultra stomp rocket and the jr one, but I heard great reviews by him and that is all that matters to me! Highly recommended.	1
GREAT fun for the kids and they LOVE to stomp the rockets as high as they can go. Plus, it gets a TON of energy out of the kids when mom and dad shoot the rocket even further and get the kiddies all tired out chasing them (extra bonus).	1
This rocket goes so much higher than the other stomp rockets sold in stores.  Adults will love this just as much as the kids.  Be prepared to lose some rockets...in the trees...on the roof, etc unless you go to a wide open area.	1
Good grief, who knew something so simple could keep a child so engaged! Just have to be careful the rockets don't get stuck up in the trees! The rockets could be more durable as the fins break off easily but made new ones from index cards using original ones as a template and they work great.	1
My two rowdy boys loved it, they were amazed at how far the rockets flew!  One would stomp and the other would fetch, they worked toghether perfectly to share, which is sometimes a struggle for them!	1
Highly entertaining for kids of all ages...but my elementary school age boys really seem to have a blast with it. Great idea for a birthday gift!	1
These are a simple, relatively safe that keeps my kids entertained for a long time.  The only complaint I have, living on a quarter acre, just a small gust of wind and we lose the rockets in neighbors yards or on the roof.  If they had some kind of weight that would bring them straight down, they may not fly as high, but we wouldn't lose them at the current rate of one per playtime.	1
Without a doubt one of the best Christmas presents received!  My 4 year old LOVES his stomp rocket!  We can't wait for Spring so we can go outside & see how far it'll fly.	1
We bought this as a gift for a 7 year old and his mom told me it was a hit!	1
These things are simple and spectacular. My boys are merciless in their attempts to achieve the best launch and it holds up fine. The squeals and laughs per minute are definitely on the high side. Highly recommend.	1
back when this first came out in the 90s me and all my friends had these. they were awesome and they still are now. i bought this for a friend and he loves it. we shoot it all the time and the rockets are still in tact. did i mention the awesome price?!?!?!  buy this people	1
I got this for my son's 5th birthday party and it was a complete hit.  Seeing the reaction of the other parents and kids I imagine a number of them will be buying these very soon.  It's such a simple concept yet completely entertaining and can also be used to teach basic principles of physics.  The age on the box is 8+ and I think older kids might be a bit bored with it.  I'm not sure why it is rated for such an old age because there are no small parts (except a screw assembly) and the rockets are very soft even when they land on heads - yes, my kids tested this.  The little kids need very little strength to get it to work.  My 21-month-old was able to get it to go about a foot off the ground and was absolutely thrilled to be able to play with the bigger kids.  The heavier the kid, the higher the rocket goes which is an excellent way to start a conversation about science and get kids curious.  And, seeing the rocket launch and figuring out where it's going to go is an endless source of entertainment.  All in all, the best money I have spent on a toy in a long time.	1
We take this to the local playground and every one comes running. Size makes a definite difference in how much force you can apply to get the rockets to fly higher. It's fun trying to watch the little kids get all excited as they try to match how high I can get mine.  We've taken the whole set out several times and all the pieces have held up really well. One kid actually tried to eat one of the rockets so it has a nice set of teeth marks and still works!	1
So much family fun.  This is a real "blast". Smaller kids will need a little help to put the power to get the height.  Hours of fun, best used in a beach (at low tide) or open field.  Kids of all ages LOVE the fun of seeing just how high you can launch using people power.  GREAT	1
gave to 11 year old twins as a gift and was told the brothers love it! the gifts had a 'rocket' theme, was great addition!	1
Bought this for my just three year old daughter. She LOVES it. She can play with it for an hour. I will buy this as a gift in the future.	1
Kids love these indoor toys.  Lots of squeals and laughter when they play with them.  Leaflet comes with it so you can order more rockets, which you will eventually.	1
My kids had one of these and loved it so I bought this one for my nephew. It also a good way to get the kids out of the house and away from the tv.	1
the grandson had a great time playing with this rocket set. i did find the parts were not well built, but i give it four stars for the fun the grandson had.	1
excelent quality and all is complete, this is beautiful and cool, all the specification is really, thanks i recomend it	1
I have one of those kids who loves the computer and it takes bribery and cajoling to get him to play outside, or at least it did.  He loves this toy and will ask if he can go play outside just to play with it, which makes me a very happy mom.  For a toy that was less than $15 he has already gotten hours of enjoyment and I am delighted with his enthusiasm for his Stomp Rockets.  This is one of those toys that if it breaks, I will happily replace it because I am so happy that it is considered to be more fun than a video game.	1
was one of her favorite gifts for CHristmas.  Easy to put together and works well and does not have any partsd that would hurt her. The rockets fly really high.	1
This is so simple I bought it for all four of my children for Christmas. Even my two year old girl loved this one.... literally for hours. I would buy this one again.	1
This toy is simple to use and easy to set up.  My 3 year old was able to use it, but her older sister (and grandparents and parents) had fun playing with it too.  This toy needs to be used outside.  If you have energetic kids, this toy encourages them to yell, run, and have fun in the yard.	1
We thought this might cause a riot with only one child lauching a rocket at a time. (We refuse to buy three identical toys for siblings.)  However, the kids quickly made it part of the game to catch another's launching rocket.  Worked well even in the snow!  It was fun for all!	1
Got this for my 5 yr old daughter from Santa.  Not only did she have a ball with it, myself, my brother, sister in law and my parents had a blast!  This thing really, really flies high when stomped on.  What is also cool is that you can aim it in different directions.  We shot it up in the air, at targets and so forth. AWESOME PRODUCT.	1
We bought this for our 7 and 4 year old nephews,and it was a hit with them and my 10 and 12 year old son and daughter! The rocket goes very fay in the air, is fun to use, provided exercise for the kids, as they have to run and chase the rocket, and overall is a great product. The toy itself looks a bit flimsy, so we were all surprised when it did exactly what it was supposed to do.	1
Bought this as a Christmas present for a very active 5 yearl old boy!  I don't know who has had more fun with it...the boy or the dad!  Great fun and lots of creative energy used trying to make it go as high as Dad.  You do need an area with lots of open space as the claim of going 200 feet is definitely true, especially for older kids or Dads!	1
Took only 30 minutes for my grandkids  to lose all the rockets.  Now it just blows air.  Maybe next year if they get another they won't use it in a 20 knot wind.  It really shoots the rocket high, then it just blows away, into trees into rivers, etc.  Nice while it lasted though.	1
Not sure about the proclaimed 200 ft in the air but it does go pretty good with little weight or effort.  For the money it keeps kids moving and not sitting in front of the tv.......and yes the adults had a time with it too!	1
Didn't get to see this rocket in action but from what I hear, it's really cool.  Hopefully I'll get to see the grandson blast this off soon!	1
Purchased for 4 and 7 year old for Christmas - they absolutely love it.  The stand comes apart every few "stomps" but not enough to stop the fun.  I would recommend it anyone interested in a simple, fun toy with few breakable parts.	1
Got this for my 4 year old nephew's birthday. We all had fun playing with it, and some 11-yr old neighbor boys had to come over and try it too. When putting my daughter to bed that night, she sweetly asked if her cousins could come over and play again real soon - IF they bring the stomp rocket :-)	1
I purchased this as a gift for my almost two year old boy and a three year old boy.  At this age it requires some minimal supervision, but it keeps them entertained for a LONG time!  Just love that look on their face every time they launch the rocket.  My five year old daughter and seven year old son also love it.  The older kids always want to get in on the action, but it does not hold their attention quite as long as the younger tots.  We have had other rocket sets in the past and this is comparable, but something we have done different this time is use it INSIDE the house instead of out.  We hooked it up in the family room on Christmas day because it was raining outside and the kids had a blast.  Darts are so soft that they don't hurt the ceiling, plus they don't get lost like they do outside, landing in a tree or on a roof.  Kids were also having fun trying to find the right trajectory to make it fly down the hallway toward a target.  We will eventually take it outside so we can get some really good height, but so far it has been fantastic fun indoors.  You can not go wrong with this toy for boy/girl or any age.  Even parents will want to get in on the action.	1
I bought this for my grandson on his 5th birthday. He enjoys it lots especially because he can jump on the "stomper" as hard as he can without damaging it. Even grown-ups can stomp this toy to make the rockets soar really high.	1
I ordered for my grandsons, but they won't be here until December.  I will have to wait and see how it works after they try it out.  I needed to update my toy closet and thought the boys would get wome enjoyment out of this rocket kit.	1
I gave this to my 10 year old grandson for his birthday. His Dad, his 2 yr old sister, myself, as well as my grandson all had a blast with this.	1
This rocket is easy to assemble and has been well used all summer long.  My only complaint is that the tube for the rocket needs to be reset each time as the screw in the plastic does not hold fast.  I use this opportunity for the kids to sound the all clear before they stomp it.  Recommended.	1
I got this toy for my youngest boy and he just loves it. His favorite thing is watching how high the rocket will go and trying to make the next one go higher.	1
We were honestly shocked by how cool this toy turned out to be.  Very easy to setup, the rockets launch a good 50-60 feet into the air at least on a good stomp and the launcher and the pad are built well enough.  It's garnered LOTS of attention from the neighborhood kids who are all asking where we got such a thing.  Our only complaint would be the durability, or lack thereof, of the rockets themselves.  If they land hard or on the wrong spot, the red tails will split. This doesn't completely ruin the rocket nor the experience, but some didn't make it through two launches even.  That said, we ordered the launcher kit and replacement rockets and will be buying more.  We're very glad we purchased it, the boys love it as do the neighbor kids and we'd of course purchase it all over again, easily.  Fun toy!	1
Each year we send a box of goodies to or son at camp, with enough stuff to share with his cabin mates. We put stomp rockets and refills in the box this year, and he said that they were a blast!  Yes, fairly cheap so they don't last forever, but were tons-o-fun while they did. Good clean fun... tough to find these days.	1
We purchased this for our 5 year-old's birthday gift.  After reading the reviews, I was worried that the rockets would get stuck on rooftops or in trees.  The five year old is able to make the rocket go up 40 feet and his three-year old brother can make the rockets go up around 20 feet.  Not quite sure how some people are seeing 100+ feet.  The rocket launcher is easily manipulated to aim towards open areas.  In fact, they were able to make it horizontal and aim at passing cats.  Before PETA gets on my case again, no cats were harmed or even hit.  After the novelty of making the rockets had warn off, they started to play a game where one kid would launch and the other kid would catch the rocket.  This rocket is not recommended for indoors.  As long as the kids are not aiming it towards the tv or other breakables, there was not an issue of playing with it indoors.	1
My grandsons love this rocket.  Bought one for their house and one for mine.  Right now it is the favorite thing to do!	1
My son received this from his Aunt Holly for his 7th birthday. IT IS SO MUCH FUN!!! Buying one for my nephew. The rockets really sore in the sky! Buy one!!! This toy would be great for picnics, church picnics, or any activity outside to keep the kids entertained. lol it will keep the parents entertained too!	1
I have four active boys and this was a huge hit (ages 6, 9, 11 and 16). The littler ones liked it best but cute toy overall.  We liked it so much, we bought it for a boy for his 4th birthday party.	1
My kids love it. Not as big as I thought it would be, the rockets are small, but they do fly very high with the right person stomping on the pad. My 2.5 year old can get it about 20 ft. I am worried the stop pad will pop or wear out with larger people stepping on it, but time will tell.	1
I bought this before a family reunion at my house. It is not easy to find a toy that is fun for kids across a wide age range but this did the trick. It kept an 8 year old, 5 year old, and 1 1/2 year old entertained throughout the afternoon.  Did I mention that even the 30-somethings had fun stomping on it?  My 1 1/2 year old pulled off some of the plastic pieces on a rocket but it still works.  Also, after one day of use one rocket is stuck in my rain gutter.  It might be a good idea to buy extra rockets right away.  Overall, great inexpensive toy!  One of my better toy purchases.	1
It says it's for 8 year old and up but I bought this for my son for his third birthday and he figured it out quickly and was having a blasted playing with it. He was so amazed and just blown away at the height the little rocket that he set off went. Great toy for little ones!	1
My 4-year old loves these rockets. He and his friends have a great time playing with them. Sometimes the stand is hard to keep balanced on the grass, but on a hard surface it works great. These rockets are better than the rocket jr version. The rockets and fins are more sturdy and can fly higher in the air, but can still be damaged if handled roughly. Ultra Stomp Rockets are a hit with all of the neighborhood kids.	1
This was a major hit at my sons 6th birthday party!! Had the kids going wild running around and jumping trying to make them go higher !!! You won't be disappointed !	1
I got this to play with my boyfriend's kids, a 5-year-old girl and 7-year-old boy.  It was super easy to set up, and fun to play with.  The rocket shoots super high!  Although the age range on the box, I believe, is 8 and up, everyone played with it without problems.  The 5-year-old probably wasn't able to stomp hard enough to get it to go as high as everyone else, but it was fine.  Word of warning: don't aim for the trees or the roof of the house!  LOL.  An added bonus is that the kids get quite a bit of exercise chasing after the rockets.	1
I bought this for my 6 year old son, he loves it and says it the best gift ever. Such a simple toy with no batteries, noises or any flashy gadgets, but so much fun. Easy to set up and easy to use.	1
This is one of the best purchases that I've made on Amazon thus far. It was easy to set up and it doesn't take much effort too launch a rocket. The amount of effort that the kids put in , determines exactly how high the rocket goes. And boy does it go! I think we achieved the 200 feet marker many times during play. The rockets follow a basically set trajectory due to it spinning motion whilst traveling upwards and the nose is foam tipped, which it always tends to land on. As for the durability, well it outlasted my kids for about 3 hours, with all 4 rockets still accounted for and launcher intact, and that in itself is a record for Guinness. My kids had a lot of fun trying to outdo one another with the rockets' trajectory. All in all , an excellent product!	1
Gave to son for X-mas, gets lots joy.  Nice fill in toy for when want to do something different.  Toy is very durable	1
Kids love it, they get good excercise as well jumping and running. Fun for the whole family. I do recommend this product.	1
I trusted other reviews in selecting a gift for my 9 yr old nephew and I'm glad I did.  He gives it a thumbs up...says it goes really high!!!	1
My 3yr old daughter saw this toy at the park and loved the older kids playing with it so I bought one for her on line.  She only weighs 25lbs so she had a hard time launching the rockets until she started to jump on it with both feet very hard.  She loves it.  well worth the $12 bucks I paid.	1
I bought 2 of these as stocking stuffers for my boys, ages 4 and 6. I wasn't expecting too much really given they were about $10 each.  Boy was I wrong!! This was literally the most popular toy my boys opened on Christmas. They were simple to set up (6 year old put his together himself) and completely simple to use. My boys took these outside and played for about 2 hours. Bundled up, ski pants, mittens, the works my kids couldn't get enough.  I will likely need to buy more of the rockets soon, but they are so inexpensive I will likely stock up to carry us through the summer. I also plan to keep this in mind for my boys friends birthday parties.	1
WOW!  Santa brought this toy for my kids today and we ALL (kids and adults) love it.  It really goes high; buy the extra rockets just in case one gets stuck in a tree.  This was played with for hours today.  Really great toy and a great price.	1
Really, who wouldn't love these?  It was perfect for my 'Rough Playing' nephew, he had a blast seeing how far up he could get them to go.	1
On the fun scale, this is a 10 out of 5.  The kids love it.  Don't let the age recommendation fool you, when we bought our first one (I'll get to that later), my son was 3 and loved it.  He had no problem jumping on the pump with 2 feet and getting a good launch.  The base of the product is a bit of a pain.  It doesn't stand up on it's own very well, and I like to secure it to my lawn with a few landscape stakes.  The wing nut that holds the launcher up is also annoying as it's constantly loosening and the launcher keeps falling to a lower angle.  I recently took the advice of another reviewer and tied a rubber band around the launcher and the base to help hold the launcher in place.  It's works well.  The biggest issue I have with this product is the quality of the rockets.  They are VERY flimsy.  The tubes are very thin and easily breakable and the fins at the bottom are also very thin and not secured well to the tube.  After a year of occasional use, our first stomp rocket had no useable rockets left, so we had to get another one.  If this was more expensive I'd have a big problem with the quality of the rockets, but given the low price, I had no reservations about just buying a new one.	1
Ordered for our grandsons, ages 4-6.  All the neighborhood kids lined up to take a turn, too.  They had a blast and it's still working a month later.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but it received rave reviews from their mom - kept them busy for quite a while.	1
My kids got 2 of these - it took the little guys (ages 6 and 9) about 1 minute to set up the bases, and then it was stomp fun.  The rockets stand up to a fair amount of abuse (being stepped on, etc) - they are made of durable, rigid plastic.  Three little fins at the back of each rocket lead to better flying.  The adjustable  tube means you can point this where you want it.  It's fun to take these out as a family - Daddy likes to send the rockets flying and let the little ones run to retrieve them.  You need a pretty big space - we go to the nearby park.  An adult can get the rocket to go really far - even the kids can send the rockets 100 feet away.  I recommend this for its durability, its fun-ness, and how easy it is to set up and put away.  This toy is a winner.  (we paid about $15 each for two boxes, and bought a couple of sets of extra rockets at about $5 each.)	1
We got this toy last spring.  It was the hit toy of the summer.  My boys (5 and 7 at the time) loved taking turns shooting the rockets up.  And they loved when my husband or myself would do it too and make it go really high.  Given the toy is light and the tips are soft and rounded, they would chase the rocket and try to catch it.  Excellent toy.  While it comes with several rockets, I'd recommend getting a spare packet of them... the one flaw is that for kids who are not as kind to their toys, the flaps at the bottom of the rockets pull off - and once they are off, the rocket flies weird.  (One guest of ours ruined the rocket in minutes... after months of my boys playing with them without issue).	1
I bought this for my two-and-a-half year old son to use at a vacation house this summer.  Based on the previous reviews, I didn't see any reason to go with the "junior" version, even though his age would suggest otherwise.  I am so glad I made this purchase.  We took turns stomping the rocket - although he couldn't get them to go as high as I could, he still really got a kick out of stomping the rocket.  I had to beg to take my turn!  The rocket goes really high!  Cheap thrills, for sure, but this is a legitimate educational tool as well (once he gets older).  We used it all weekend long, and again several times at home outside before the weather got cold.  I am certain we'll bring it out again in the spring.  This seems as durable as you could reasonably expect, and I won't hesitate to replace it if it breaks.  Great for kids of all ages, I would say.	1
I'm amazed that anyone would give this toy more than one star. We received it as a gift. It is very poorly designed, awkward to assemble and flimsy. We received it as a gift and within about a month every piece of it was broken in some way, including the rockets/arrows (the cheap plastic cylinders on them cracked and the fins/fletching on every one of them had broken off). The "pump" part started out with a lot of force, but after a few weeks didn't work well anymore. And the "stand" snapped apart.  We once had a similar kind of toy made by Air Hogs that was MUCH better made with higher quality, thicker plastic. It required no awkward assembly, was easier to aim and lasted about 3 years. My kids love playing with this type of toy, and I am going to try to find that brand again.	-1
We had kids from age 2 to age 7 in the community area going crazy with this toy for a couple hours today. I know the age range is listed higher for the Ultra Stomp Rocket version but I don't see why considering a 2 year old can use it. The bigger you are the higher it shoots. Lots of fun!	1
This toy shoots extremely high, it is really fun and my 7 and 10 year old love it. I bought extra darts and I'm glad I did because we lost a couple on the roof and in the trees.  It has held up great and is extremely fun for the whole family to watch. Well worth the price.	1
We got this toy for fun in the sun, and also to teach kids the science behind it.  It is very well received and provides continuous fun.  My son asks for it whenever we go out to play in the backyard.  His friends line up to take turns, too.  We haven't lost any foam rockets yet, either!	1
We bought the Ultra Stomp Rocket with refills for our 2 year old along with the Glow stomp rocket junior for the younger ones.  It is alot of fun--something dad likes to do with him.  The rockets interchange with the ultra stomp rocket kit and the glow stomp rocket junior kit.  The Glow rockets don't go quite so high but seem more durable.  The hard plastic on the ultra stomp rockets does tend to break.  For the value, I would recommend getting a second kit rather than buying the replacement rockets. This will allow you to "compete" when blasting off.  Additionally, we bought the super high performance ultra stomp refills (for dad mostly).  These unfortunately do not fit either the ultra or stomp rocket junior kit so we are unable to use them.  The diameter of these rockets is more narrow--wish the add would have explained that.  Load of fun!  The durability in the stand could be better as it often comes apart but due to the cost, it is not unexpected.	1
I was looking for some fun outdoor toys for my 5 year-old daughter that we could enjoy together.  This fits the bill.  It has been a lot of fun.  I also have used it to teach her about taking turns so that I can make sure I get a chance to stomp. My one year-old boy also likes even though he can't make take off on his own--we just jump on it together.  I would give it five stars but the stand keeps coming apart so it is a little annoying.  Otherwise great toy.	1
This is an awesome toy.  It keeps the kids busy and allows mom to sit for a awhile. My 3 year old has no problem reloaded and launching.  Even my one year old loves to sit on it and watch the rocket go.  Very happy that it came with 4 rockets.  I bought two one for each, but dad seems to like as well.  They like to have a contest of who's rocket can go further.  The only issue is that I would like the base to be sturdier.  But I would totally buy another for the kids and for gifts.	1
This is my go-to gift for 4-6 year olds.  I originally bought it for a little boy's 5th birthday, but my 4-year old daughter liked to so much, she had to have one too.  It is simple enough for younger kids to use, but just as fun for older kids who can stomp the rocket much higher!  Highly recommend it!	1
We had another rocket launch toy that my son (5 and a half) loved but was just about worn out.  We got this as a replacement, but it is VERY hard for even me as an adult to get good height because the "pillow" you stomp on is very large.	-1
My son who is 4 and daughter is 5 loves playing it.  Worth the money.	1
The base for the launcher pad is a little flimsy, but it is easy enough to put back together when it comes apart. Other than that, the toy is great. I debated whether or not to buy this set or the junior set for my three year old son, and am happy with my purchase. My son is able to get the rockets pretty high, and loves to watch me send them flying over the roof of our house.	1
I purchased this toy for my son's 4th birthday.  He and his brother play with it a lot.  They just don't seem to get tired of it.	1
Prior to purchasing, I searched all over to try and figure out the difference between the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ultra-Stomp-Rocket/dp/B0006O8Q7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ultra Stomp Rocket</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Junior-Stomp-Rocket-Kit/dp/B0006N6UQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Junior Stomp Rocket Kit</a>.  Both products list for a similar price. The Junior version advertises that rockets will soar up to 100 feet in the air and the Ultra version lists a slightly higher height of up to 200 feet. But the age ranges for the 2 products are substantially different with the Junior Stomp Rocket recommending ages 3-8 and the Ultra Stomp Rocket recommending ages 8+.  For my 4yo son, we started with the Junior Stomp Rocket. He LOVES it! When/If going outside is not possible, he holds the stomp pad under his arm and points the rocket and shoots the missiles around the house. Because the rockets are all foam, they do not do any damage to walls, furniture, (or mom and dad, thankfully). When outside, my son literally plays with this toy for hours, adjusting and playing around with how hard you need to stomp to get the rocket to go really high.  Both the Ultra and the Junior Stomp Rocket kits come with a plastic rectangular "stomp pad" connected to a flexible tube. The end of the tube connects to one of the plastic/foam rockets (4 are includeded in each kit). There is a small plastic stand that you can put together to use as a launch base. Snap the plastic tube onto the base and stomp on the pad. Air is shot through the tube and propels the foam rocket up into the air.  We now have both the Ultra and the Junior Stomp Rocket kits and the only real difference I found is in the size and shape of the rocket missiles.  The Ultra Stomp Rocket missiles are larger in size and shape. They have a plastic shaft with small plastic fins on the bottom and a large foam head. The junior stomp rocket missiles are smaller and made entirely of foam.  Other than that, the launching equipment for both are exactly the same.  Refill Rockets for both the Junior and Ultra models come in varying colors and sell (at least on Amazon) for under $[...].  Whether you buy the Ultra Stomp Rocket (listed here) or it's sister product Junior Stomp Rocket, you will be getting a fantastic toy! This toy is so simple - no assembly required, no batteries, just easy to use and loads of fun!  I do have a slight preference in favor of the Junior Stomp Rocket, only because I like the missiles that are all foam if you are going to be using the toy inside. Also, the junior version has glow in the dark refill rockets. Really cool for night time use&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Junior-Stomp-Rocket-Toy-Glow-in-the-Dark-Refills/dp/B000Y887XK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Junior Stomp Rocket Toy Glow in the Dark Refills</a>.  For some reason, you can only get the glow in the dark refills in the "junior" size.	1
I bought this toy for my son last year and as presents for other children this year. When the kids opened the gift I was almost as excited as they were, we played with it for several hours...one child would stomp and someone else would try to catch it.  It is simple and fun; if the child is old enough to stomp their foot, they can get a reaction from the rocket. I would give it an age range of 3 - 13 and when your child is playing, it is both entertaining to watch and participate in the fun.  It's educational and fun, but not durable enough for older children. It has foam tips that can tear when kids use the toy as a cannon (you know who you are), but launched in a clearing it will last a long time. And my husband adds; "They go super sky high".	1
We all love this toy! It shoots high and even our 3 yr.old can get it to go high! A lot of fun!!!	1
I bought this toy after our extended family (kids ages 2-20) enjoyed playing with the one that was in the condo we rented on the beach.  That one had clearly been played with a lot and was still in good shape.  Haven't had the opportunity to use ours yet, but I expect the same results.  You do want to have a good sized open area to play with it as even our youngest one was able to stomp it hard enough to make it go a distance.  Like nearly any toy, it could be dangerous if misused...you don't want to be launching the rockets right at someone or looking right into one when it launches, but even if you did it would likely hurt but not cause serious injury.	1
Big and huggable	1
Oh. My. Goodness. Our 4 YO son is absolutely in love with this animal - whom he has named "Fluff Fluff." When we purchased this for him as a Christmas gift, we were hoping it would alleviate all the requests to get a dog from both our children and it certainly has! Fluff Fluff is the best pet - easy to care for, super cuddly, and a great friend. :)	1
My Grandson loves cuddling with his dog!!!	1
My daughter made a bunch of bracelets with this.  She is 10 and I had to help her a lot with the first one to figure out how it was supposed to work, but then she could pretty much roll with it and made four more basically on her own.	1
a friend of mine who is native american and she like it.	1
This was a birthday gift and the young girl loved it.	1
My daughters are having fun!	1
Fairly easy to manipulate and stretch the frame to make larger pieces Yet sturdy enough to not bend when you tighten down the strings. It was a bit off balacne but again easy enough to twist it a bit and make it more stable.  The wooden rollers and the screws that hold them in place on each end are a bit finicky.. you have to set them and make sure it dosnt slide out when you tighten it down.  The thread included I can't say much about as I used some string I had on hand already, same with the beads.. although I did look through the beads and they seem to be decent.	1
really liked it. wanted something that requires no batteries !!	1
granddaughter loves it	1
This was a gift for my mom.  She has dementia and lives in a adult care facilty.  She always loved dogs and is always happier to see our dog when we visit, than she is to see us.  (She doesn't really know who we are anymore.)  So, I thought she might enjoy having a big, fluffy dog for her bed, and she did!	1
My godson love his new puppy.	1
Great	1
It was delivered fast and packaged well! I love crafty stuff and tried this bead making kit out. It's worth it for the price but this is definitely not made for kids! Took me awhile to figure out how to set it up and it's very hard to use.  But the bracelets turned out beautifully!	1
for my daughter.  she likes it.	1
Lots of fun for a beginner.	1
Basic but works just fine! Threading it up was the most difficult but I solved that but using one continuous length of thread.	1
My sister in law loves to do crafts especially with beads.  I noticed some of her beadwork and decided to purchase this as a Christmas gift.  She loved it and should be making me a bracelet very soon.	1
wonderful	1
too stiff for a pillow. am returning it for a softer dog.	-1
This is a beautiful large stuffed animal. It is plush and cuddly. I think most kids would love it.	1
The kids ride him like a pony. He gets a lot of love in our house.	1
I gave this as a Christmas gift and it was a hit	1
This stuffed dog is adorable. Good quality, it doesn't look like a cheesy toy you win at the carnival. We bought this for my 3 year old for his birthday and he absolutely loves it. He wants to take it everywhere with us, but we always have to make an agreement that "Fire wenchen" (Fire Engine) stays in the car b/c he's too big.	1
This is a hit with my goldendoodle puppy who loves playing with it. Unfortunately it lasted only 4 months but I think I will buy another one for my goldendoodle puppy.	1
Its big, soft, squishy, loveable, and kids love it! Sleep with it, sleep on it, play with it. I've thrown it into the washer after it was dropped in the mud, and it came out good as new, with very little lint left in the dryer. It doesn't shed, eat, pee, or poop! Can't get more perfect. Buy this!	1
This plush dog was a hit wth my animal loving granddaughter.  She will get her real live puppy in a couple of days but she can snuggle and cuddle this one now.  The puppy is soft and well made.  Worth the money.  ;)	1
THIS WAS A VERY NICE GIFT AND I THINK IT WAS DISCRIBED ACCURATELY.	1
LOVE this dog! We ordered this for our daughter since we no longer have our yellow lab/golden mix. This dog is HUGE! Daughter loves to snuggle up next to her, almost like a big body pillow. I'd say if you make this pup sit, she's about the size of a 4-5 month old puppy. Such a sweet face, totally looks like a lab. We love this stuffed animal!! The fur is SO soft, doesn't tangle or get the little fuzz balls.	1
I love my puppy's a lot they are right next to me	1
Best. Stuffed. Animal. Ever.  I got this as a gift from my best friend when I was 14. I am not 28 and have slept with this evert since then. I know you're thinking wow, a grown woman sleeping with a stuffed animal. It's super soft and it makes the perfect pillow. I actually decided to look for another one just like it because I like it so much and I worry about not ever being able to find one just like it, if I ever should need a replacement. I absolutely love it.	1
Loved the dog for the bed.  Really large just wish it was a little more softer than it is.  Pretty face.	1
Great quality and color	1
This is the cutest, most well made puppet I have seen in awhile. It's much cuter than the picture. I'm so glad I made the purchase.	1
Great little puppet and inexperienced!!	1
This is very, very cute and big. It wasn't what I expected at first.. A lot larger then I thought but our little guy loves it and lays on it to watch TV.  Very soft and plush.	1
excellent	1
My dog loves Giraffe Puppet	1
A giraffe puppet is an unexpected treat. This giraffe will fit adult and children-sized hands. The puppet is nicely made and engaging.	1
MY HANDS ARE TOO BIG	-1
didn't buy.	-1
I love the other puppet that we got from the same store (the frog) but this one the giraffe's eyes look weird and slanted it makes him look very mean. My daughter does not like this one very much but loves the others!	-1
For THE SECOND TIME, I got a giraffe puppet different from the website description. Not only it looks different -smaller ears and horns, black and cheep hairs-, but most of all the eyes are in plastic and GLUED, totally unsafe. Returned it for the second time!	-1
Buttons are very difficult to push.	-1
I got this for my almost 3 years daughter's Christmas present. First of all when we wanted to assemble the chair, 2 of the screws were missing. My husband managed to somehow make it happen since the kiddo was really excited. Now after less than a month I can see the the wooden part on top is a little inflated!!! we live in LA not even a humid area which may affect the quality of woods. Anyways.... not happy with the quality. But the design is nice and can make your kids happy	-1
I was so excited about this for my little ones. When we opened the box the toxic fumes were so bad that I had a headache for hours. Everyone in the room got sick and we had to take it outside immediately. I have no idea how this company can live with themselves to sell such toxic toys to little children. It is such a neat piano and they could choose to do the right thing and use non-toxic optionsbut made in China and knocked everyone out in the room. Returning it and actually so upset about it I am writing reviews everywhere. Toys won't make your children good at music if it is wrecking their brains with toxic formaldehyde, benzene, lead or other chemicals terrible. Children should under no circumstances be subjected to the kind of chemicals emanating from that toy.	-1

The best thing is, it is cute and it's red.  The quality is not the greatest.  Don't expect it to last forever, but it is darling.	-1
The first time we ordered this piano, we waited until Christmas Eve to take it out of the box to assemble.  The first thing I noticed was the bag of screws was already opened, so I'm pretty sure it was already returned.  The next thing I noticed was the parts didn't match the manual that came with it.  The major problem with this piano was the legs didn't match.  Only 1 leg fit the piano, and the screws to the rear leg's base were missing.  Returned!  The 2nd piano we ordered was a bust too.  The keys stuck together.  When they finally would depress, they had to be manually be forced up into the rest position.  Returned!  Although this would have been a wonderful piano, I'm not going to take my chances with a 3rd order.	-1
bottom base did not have colors on it....white paint....looks like they didn't finish it or something.	-1
After two months of excessive mouthing and chewing, the wood bases are splintering and falling apart. Keep an eye on this toy if you have a chewer.	-1
Do not like the clothes very much.	-1
The package was missing a leg (no small part to miss) and some of the needed special bolts.  Result was no toy for the birthday party...........  Some of the embeded bolts were not well set making strong assembly impossible.  All round I would never order something like this from these folks again, and recommend others beware.  A couple of weeks later........ I upgraded this to two stars after getting the replacement parts.  I am still not happy with how some of the embeded bolts work and there was obviously a quality control problem with the original shipment.  But now that it is together with all the pieces my granddaughter seems to really like it.	-1
Returning. The inside of the mouth is rough plastic, very hard to maneuver, can't fit hand in well, and just difficult overall. Disappointed	-1
I hate writing reviews that aren't 5 stars, but nothing sticks to this =(  I'm so bummed because we purchased many felt figures to do interactive stories and this board doesn't work =(  My 2 year old still tries, than of course the animal or person falls and she gets so flustrated.  I haven't had the heart to throw it away, I paid to much just to pitch it...but is there some sort of trick????  Is mine defective?  Yesterday I put Velcro on a few of the characters, than the back of the vecro on the board just so it's getting some sort of use.  I could have done that on ANYTHING.... also I don't know if I was supposed to receive what was in the picture, but we received what looks like the big blue board in the back, we did not receive anything else.  Just a folded blue board that does not work.  I planned on using this for a class I teach, and no way... it will just aggravate the kids.  has anyone else had this issue?  I'm wondering if I somehow got a broken board, I don't know if its too late to return, but the actual box is long gone...	-1
The fabric seemed more synthetic than most felt boards.  It pilled and pieces of it clumped together and drooped.  I expected more than a year out of it, but we are ready to toss it.	-1
yay. you too can birth innocent minds and feed them with completely false information and just witness the INCREDIBLE results! ignorant misguided little ones that will grow up and run for office-poo one day. they won't know what hit them and neither will planet earth.	-1
awful	-1
The crayons looked like someone had used them...	-1
These crayons are washable and rich in color but they break easily.  My 2 year old daughter has broken each one with just regular use...not pressing too hard or throwing, etc...just with simple scribbling.  Plus these flake, leaving small particles everywhere.  Would not purchase again.	-1
My one year old received this as a gift for his birthday . But 5 min after opening the box, the magnet came off one gear and within the next 2-3 days, the magnets started falling off all the gears . I called the company twice, because the moment I started talking, they hung up. Then I called again and asked not to hang up , finally they agreed and sent me a shipping label for replacement, but as another customer has pointed out, there was no guarantee that the new set would not have such cheap magnets. So I never sent for the replacement, instead put a scotch tape on the magnet and stuck it to the gears and they seem to be working. I have regualr magnets the same size for use on fridge, but they never came off in the last 4 years .   This is a highly priced toy for a very cheap quality item. The gears are so light weight that they keep falling with just a touch , not much fun for  my little one. My 6 year old enjoyed it for a day or two . Also the motor does not move very well .   Overall you would be better off buying some other type of magnetic gears than spending so much money on this product.  For anyone wishing to contact the company, the Computer Gear Inc  ph# : 800-373-6353 .	-1
We ended up with Cluedo (???) instead of Clue Jr. No idea what the difference is. But it is really cheap. I was hoping for a better quality product.	-1
I loved Clue growing up, so when my mother asked me for gift ideas for my 8-year-old son, I suggested Clue Jr.  Among other board games geared to his age, he received Clue Jr. as a Christmas present and was THRILLED. (He likes mysteries just like his Mom!) Unfortunately, our glee was short-lived.  My brother's girlfriend, her 12-year-old son, my son, and I sat down to play this game. My brother's girlfriend read the instructions, and we tried to figure out what to do with the color coded stickers--and how to even BEGIN play. Now, let me just say that both of us are board game aficionados who played zillions of games of Clue in our day. I have a genius IQ and she's a pediatric nurse. In short, we ain't stupid.  Yet, even mid-game, we had a hard time figuring out how to move the game pieces, how to discover clues to mark off the checklist, and so on. You see, each player does NOT have a specific game piece as in regular Clue. Instead, you peel off small stickers to place under the white bases (the green "crumb" label indicating the culprit and five time labels) and yellow drink labels to the five yellow bases.  Then, you roll a color-coded die to determine if you should look under a yellow furniture pawn, under a white character pawn, or move ANY CHARACTER forward up to the number rolled on the dice. If a character lands on a yellow space, look at the bottom of the furniture piece that's in the room (for example, the plant on the patio). Then, secretly look under the furniture pawn that's next to that room.  Even now, as I'm re-reading the instructions, I'm having a hard time understanding what to do! (So it doesn't make for easy reviewing, let alone playing!) Not only that, there's not a lot of room on the game board for putting furniture pieces BESIDE a room...let alone IN it!  We were so frustrated and bored that all four of us agreed to quit--and play Pictionary Jr., instead.  If you're feeling nostalgic and are tempted to buy Clue Jr. for a child, RESIST THE URGE. You'll be wasting your money and time in my opinion. (We're returning the game this weekend, in fact.) The pieces are chintzy, the game play is confusing, and it doesn't even come with pencils!	-1
This is literally a dumbed-down version of the standard Clue game. Basically, one needs to determine which animal has taken which toy to the dog house (which stands next to the board.) Players take turns to toss the die, which determines how many steps to take. The characters in the game are the younger versions of the same characters in the regular Clue game: Mr. Green is Johnny Green (a cheerful kid). And these characters are cardboard cutouts that fit onto white plastic pieces (people movers). The bottom of the white pieces have different pictures on them (clues). But the characters themselves actually play no part in the game. There are several pieces of furniture (also cardboard cutouts) that fit onto white plastic pieces. Under these pieces are other clues. During the game, one must travel across the board (which does not take many steps) to check under each clue piece in order to determine which two pieces are missing. The good part is that one does not need to be able to read in order to play this game: the detective's note pad uses pictures instead. So if you know the dog is not missing, you can place a mark next to the picture of the dog. The bad parts, and there are many, include: the pieces are made top heavy, and they have to, due to the nature of the game, often occupy the same spot. But, there is little space on the board for pieces to occupy the same spot. As a result, they fall easily and reveal the hidden clues. This happens very often with young players (and this game IS made for the very young ones). The way this game is designed makes process of deduction appear rather haphazard. If you have a kid that can read--even if s/he is only a beginning reader, even if your kid can spell enough to figure out a word, I suggest you move right onto the standard Clue game. Yes, at the beginning, the standard game may be a bit hard to master. But it offers enough intrigue that most kids will grow to enjoy it.	-1
Poor quality, does not really work	-1
I still haven't managed to produce the rainbow effect. Tried all possible angles and followed all the instructions. This should be brain dead simple but didn't work.	-1
Waste!	-1
Could not get a rainbow from this prism from sunlight, flashlight or room light. Also plastic box was pretty scratched up, not like a new product should come in. Get better refraction from a variety of household glassware. If you want a rainbow, you will be dissapointed.	-1
I've had prisms that worked far better than this.  I don't know why, but it didn't work too well for us.	-1
It isn't very bright at all and makes a loud humming noise when turned on.	-1
My husband bought this at Pinch a Penny without reading reviews.  This thing was awesome for a month and then boom--the blue posts became lax from spiking the ball maybe and no longer stay upright.  You can even place something underneath to keep posts upright.  Since spiking is something normally done in volleyball this should have held up for more than one month.  I just ordered a different set and hope that one will be better.  I could also see how this would break just by dunking a basketball.	-1
Hard to play. Bought it for my 8 yr old. Thought it would be good as he got older too. We rarely played it and then gave it away.	-1
The age on my box says 5+. This game is for much older children or for very advanced 5 year olds. If you're looking for a learning resource to teach younger children to read, then this might be good for you. If you're looking for a fun game to play with your child, don't buy this game; you'll be disappointed.	-1
Got this in a white elephant exchange, and I can see why the person who gave it up didn't want it. I don't remember all the rules anymore, but basically you stack the cards according to whether the item on one card will fit inside the item on the top or bottom card in the stack. But you can be creative. Does an apple fit in a car? Yes. Does a car fit in an apple? Sure, if it's a toy car, of if it's "the big apple." That kind of thing. Which basically means any card can go anywhere, and the whole game is pointless.	-1
Too open-minded in my mind. I tried using it in my classroom with my gifted/talented third graders and we all just found it too vague and confusing.	-1
VERY boring game.	-1
The concept of the game is easy enough, players attempt to place cards in order of either greater or smaller sizes depending on a particular stack. One could argue that the concept of the word "love" is bigger than a parking lot, so a parking lot could fit within the scope of love. The point is anyone is capable of arguing their case, but when it's put to a vote, unless it's an extremely solid argument, players vote on whatever benefits themselves. where this game fails is in it's lack of anonymity. When something is put to a vote that could tip the game one way or another players will always vote for whats best for them. "In a Pickle" attempts to be both competitive and engaging. It's overambitious which leaves it wanting in every aspect.	-1
I got this game and had high hopes for it with my Wednesday gaming group. But the rules leave room for interpretation and we had several disagreements with each other as to what goes in or on something else. We did the democratic thing and voted to solve disputes, but still this game left a bad taste in some peoples' mouths. As a result, I stopped bringing this game and gave it away at a Christmas raffle. It's intended to be fun, but be prepared for some disagreements among players.	-1
This is a very boring game.  I find that the rules leave so much to the imagination that there really is very little boundaries or structure.  I do not recommend this game.	-1
magnets were not strong enough	-1
Lame cheap game	-1
Could be better.  There isn't much to it.	-1
I bought this for a tree house and took it down after I saw how difficult it was for my kids to climb up. I had a hard time climbing up it.	-1
Not quite a kit when they tell you to supply 5 pounds of screws. Aside from that this kit is NOT worth $70 at all. The seats and rings are light plastic and the brackets are thin at maybe 20 gauge steel. The instructions are in like 4 different languages so it's annoying to read. I'm not impressed with this "kit" Only good thing about this is it may last 2 years. If it does I'll be back to rate this one star higher.	-1
This is made of yarn. Not a real net as it would break easily. Not worth the money paid thinking it was real netting.	-1
once assembled it's very nice, square head screws are the worst invention on the planet get 10 or 12 drill bits they will strip out fast. I put mine together alone after work in 3 days and just during that 3 days unpacking as I go, one of the swings melted in the bag	-1
Good Product, installation instructions are unclear.  Missing the wood pieces shown in the picture.	-1
Wonky and the wooden bars make it awkward. It doesnt come with wood ends just four long screws to go in the top end of your swing set. The bottom MUST be attached to something you can not let it just dangle or it becomes a hazard. The wood dowels also have aquired mildew or mold on them after being outside for only one fall and winter. I wish we would have just added a 4th swing instead now we have an empty space where this was soon to be a new swing.	-1
The kids liked it for a little while but being in the sun quickly broke the plastic down and now every time it rains it fills with water, very disappointed it barely lasted 1 summer. Seems like almost all toys these days are made very poorly bad quality.	-1
Doesn't work, very hard to operate	-1
Horrible gun. The fake marshmallows do not work. The real marshmallow minis do not work.  The tube gets sticky and the marshmallows jam. The tube doesn't hold enough pressure to force a marshmallow out of the gun each time attempted. When the gun does operate correctly  a single marshmallow might fly two to three feet. Terrible product. I wasted my money on two of these guns for Christmas!  That is right! Neither gun works well.  These should be in a dollar store and not worth the price.	-1
Hasn't worked for us. Won't hold a vacuum. Getting the tube back in place in tricky and caused the end to break off. Tried super gluing that back on and I'm getting vacuum now, but the marshmallows just keep getting stuck and jammed. I have cleaned it multiple times. the manufacturer says to use fresh marshmallows (which I have) and to try cornstarch in the bag of marshmallows (which I haven't tried because it seems to me that would make clean up more challenging. )	-1
This gun does not work as advertised.  I bought three blue/red (original?) shooters and they seemed to work okay.  This pink one simply didn't create the vacuum or whatever it uses to force the tiny marshmallows out.  My little girl was very disappointed when the other 3 shooters worked for our guests, but her very own failed.  I haven't taken the time to explore a return as the holiday season has just been a bit hectic, so I can't comment on customer service from Marshmallow Fun Co yet.	-1
Worked 1x	-1
Gets jammed ALL the time!	-1
I bought 3 of these.  One grandchild tried the first one. It worked great for the first few shots. Then the marshmallows jammed.  I tried everything. Finally washed it and let it dry overnite. Tried it again with the same results. The marshmallows seem to melt inside the unit and stick to the sides. I asked to get a new one.  The seller was amazing and sent a new one. Unfortunately the same thing happened with the new one and the other two I had bought. So they were a total waste. I never bothered returning the other ones so threw away all of that money.	-1
Extremely frustrating marshmallow gun..... constantly gets jammed with marshmallow's, even if they are fresh and not sticky.  My 8 year old used it once and has not asked to buy marshmallow's again for it due to how disappointing it was.  Waste of money.......	-1
TERRIBLE! The thing would not work! The marshmallows got sticky  I was going to buy this for each of my children Thankfully I only got duped on this one.	-1
Didn't work for us. Marshmallow don't come out	-1
This new would shoot the marshmallows.  They always got stuck.  However I ordered 2 in the blue color and they worked fine	-1
Just got this as a gift for my son, we can't get it to work. At first I bought vegan non gmo marshmallows, they didn't work. So I bought $1 bag of chemical crap, didn't work either. He was so disappointed :/	-1
I purchased three of these. None of them would shoot more than one or two marshmallows before jamming. None of them would shoot the little foam pellets, either. I was so sad they didn't work.	-1
Broke after 5 minutes of play.	-1
Meh.  Does not shoot straight and too hard to keep pumping.	-1
This gun broke the first day we had it.  I purchased two of these for my son and his friend to have a Marshmallow gun war....it was a major bummer!	-1
First of all, these are adorable. The pink cheetah print for girls is pretty cute. These guns are easy to load and really easy to use. I got 2 of these for my little girls thinking they'd have a wonderful time playfully shooting each other with marshmallows, but I was wrong. What makes these guns a waste of money is the fact that the suction doesn't work half the time, and the plastic chamber gets clogged/jammed occasionally. Mini marshmallows have to be sort of stale if you want them to move through effortlessly providing the actual suction works.  If they are remotely fresh and soft, they don't seem to move... like AT ALL. This is without over stuffing, and proper direction following. Another thing.. do NOT leave marshmallows in the chamber for a long period of time.  My daughters did overnight and by morning they were sort of gooey and stuck. This was a pain to clean out. Way too time consuming. They became very quickly disinterested and decided to sit and eat their marshmallows instead.  I would NOT recommend these to anybody.  Despite my sour review, I'm including a cute picture of my girls posting with their guns for your viewing pleasure. Enjoy.	-1
Not impressed with this marshmallow shooter. It gummed up almost as soon as we got it. We were not abla to shoot more a tube or 2 through the unit. It may be just picky with marshmallows, but I would not recommend as a gift unless you enjoy frustrated children (who doesn't right).	-1
My son and I were disappointed to learn that this particular marshmallow gun would not shoot a single marshmallow. We tried everything to make it work but no luck. NEXT!	-1
I bought this for my 14 year old and it was a major fail. He was excited at first, but it was kind of cheaply made and we couldn't fit any marshmallows in it. The instructions I feel were not really clear for someone who has no experience with something like this. I saw another gun similar and they have little marshmallow looking bullets. Was I missing something? I would not buy another one of these.	-1
these things are worthless,,, the marshmellows keep sticking in the gun and make a really big mess,,, they break easily also... not worth your money	-1
I want to love this but the marshmallows easily get stuck.  :(  Christmas day my kids were already complaining about not being able to use them.	-1
Doesn't work, do not waste your money. You will have disappointed kids.	-1
What a disappointment.  The opening was to small for the marshmallow to shoot out of.  Will be retuning this one!  Good thing I bought the bow and arrow for the other Grandson, which worked perfectly.  Only problem being was that they had to share on Christmas morning!!!	-1
Gave this to a 10 year old for christmas.  I bought store brand marshmallows and they seemed like they were too sticky and wouldn't shoot.  So---we cleaned the gun out--and went to get some "jet puffs".  They were a little better.  It shoots about 1 out of 10.  This works by pumping a chamber with a marshmallow inside it.  Then when it gets high enough pressure it shoots.  HOWever, many times the marshmallow just gets larger by the pressure and the middle starts to stick to the sides of the gun and it makes a mess.  The idea is good, the way it gets accomplished is not good. RATINGS:  ABILITY TO SHOOT MARSHMALLOWS---1 MESS MAKING ABILITY  10 FUN  2 DISAPPOINTMENT  10 VALUE FOR MONEY  1  In otherwords, don't buy this thing.  The child is very excited until they go to use it and then they are very disappointed.	-1
Did not work well. Somehow could not pump up enough pressure to blow out the marshmallow. Worked sometimes, then there appeared to be some kind of leak so could not build any pressure. I could not fix the leak	-1
You really need VERY stale marshmallows for this shooter. Even then its not great.  Often shoots either none or multiple marshmallows. Not easy for a young kid because the have to tilt the whole thing down to get the marshmallows into the chamber and little ones don't want to be bothered by such things.	-1
It doesn't shoot 25 feet. More like 25 inches.  For the design, it's basically a blowpipe with a pvc barrel that's too big, filled with curves and jagged edges.  You will be lucky if the bullet even falls out the end.  You will get better results from a drinking straw.  I'd like to give this product zero stars, but it's not an option.	-1
Grandkids had trouble keeping the marshmallows hard enough to shoot!  Kept getting stuck in the shooter! Not a good idea to use below 50 degrees!	-1
This should be called a "marshmallow mangler,"  not a "marshmallow shooter."  Every marshmallow I put in this thing became a sticky, gooey mess as it tried to exit out the poorly designed hole in the front.  Don't waste your money, or get your hopes up.	-1
While this toy seems like it would be great fun- its a big disappointment!  The marshmallows get stuck in the tube and then it won't fire.  For this to work you really need to leave your marshmallows out overnight to let them harden up a bit, which makes them hurt if you take a hit.  Also- they turn to mush in your yard and then your kids will drag sticky spots all over your house. Oh yes- the dog will throw them up.  Save your money and buy a Nerf!	-1
I saw these and my first thought was, "WANT!" I bought two as a Christmas gift. Used name brand mini-marshmallows. Maybe it will fire, maybe it wont. Maybe it'll fire three in a row then stop altogether, meaning you have to take it apart, fix the jam, put back together, and go again. And there's no guarantee the next one will fire. Maybe it will, maybe it will jam again and need to be fixed. There is no reliability with these things, and I recommend you not bother. Very disappointed.	-1
Within five seconds, it jammed and all of the marshmallows were stuck inside.  What a joke of a toy!	-1
8 year old thought that this was junk and the tricks made no sense.	-1
Maybe if my son were older he would have been more interested. He's six and the tricks weren't interesting enough to sit down and learn them.	-1
missing 6 multiplying rabbits	-1
VERY cheap!!  Garbage!!	-1
The directions consist of a booklet with many magic tricks.  I'm sure the DVD will be helpful, but I was disappointed at the amount of stuff in the box.  Many of the tricks describe using things that are not included in the box - a deck of cards, coins, hankie, etc.  There aren't any clear directions on where to put stickers, other than looking at the picture on the box.  Disappointed.	-1
This set is cute and fun for my beginner engineer. The trains are well made. And I got the set for a decent pre-Christmas price, and getting a battery powered Thomas with it makes it a pretty good buy for a starter set. I don't even mind that the battery powered Thomas typically eats an AA battery every day or two. Here comes the big BUT other reviewers have mentioned. For the amount of money you pay for Thomas items, these tracks do not hold together well. And the battery powered Thomas is constantly tipping over on the curves, or if it's pulling other trains they tip over on the hill. My son loves this set but gets very frustrated when his trains keep going off track. I won't be returning it because he has loved playing with it daily since he got it. But really, I'm going to try another brand of track for expansion. Most of the off-brand tracks aren't made with traction to supposedly improve the performance of the battery powered trains, but I'm willing to give them a shot, as you get a lot more track for the money, and the performance of these is not impressive. I also just ordered the track locking clips sold on amazon, which I hope will help. I knew I'd have to spend more to expand our Thomas collection, but I didn't count on having to spend more just to get good performance from this set.	-1
didn't work for the car	-1
This was a 2nd order to find out the right charger for my son Power Wheels and it didn't match either. Not sure if it is or not a good product.	-1
it didn't fit the power wheels vechicle so needed to be returned!	-1
The movers lost our original charger. This charger doesn't work. Very disappointed.	-1
If I buy a battery for a power wheels car I should very well get a free charger with it, the whole world of electronics works that way, this shouldn't be any different	-1
When plugged in, the indicator light didn't light up at all and it didn't charge the battery. As I can see from other recent reviews in the last week or two, I am not alone. Must have been a bad production batch?? Thankful for Amazon's excellent customer service and the quick sending out of a replacement one, which hopefully will work.	-1
I think I have spent over $250 on Toy chargers only to find out they do not work.  I could have saved  money by just purchasing a NOCO Genius charger.  Note:  You would need to do some modifications to use the Genius charger, but worth it.	-1
The back of the gold and silver coins showed wear and tear along with scratches	-1
I ordered this coin set for my son's birthday. The coin case came very poorly wrapped inside a dilapidated shipping box that had clearly been used before. Perhaps because the coin case was shaking around in the box, the coins were completely loose inside the case, and the enclosed Harry Potter plaque was also loose (with a lot of sticky glue residue in its back). Unfortunately, the edges of the coins are scuffed.  I placed the coins back in their proper place, and have tried to glue the plaque back as well, and I think my son will like the gift because he's a huge Harry Potter fan. I'm hoping the scuff marks on the coins won't bother him, but they do bother me a lot. When you pay $25.95 plus shipping for a brand new item, you expect it to arrive in pristine condition.  On the plus side, the seller shipped the item very quickly, after promptly responding to an email inquiry from me about whether it would be possible to get the item in time for my son's birthday.  Overall, it was very disappointing to open the shipping box, and see the case in the state it arrived. If the item had been shipped properly, with an intact case inside, I would have rated this item 4 stars (taking away 1 star because I think it's overpriced).	-1
Not what expected	-1
Multiple missing parts!	-1
did not realize snap together	-1
Very small and not very interesting toy	-1
Great idea, poor execution.  Very difficult to see a thing and keep it in focus, and the lighting function for underwater, which is why I bought it, doesn't really work unless you're in pretty clear water.	-1
Kids showed no interest in the workings of this toy. Kids just remove flashlight from it and use that for play.	-1
This was supposed to be a child sized hat. It's huge, it could fit an extremely fat man's head easily. It's sewn very poorly so it just looks like a big lumpy mess. The bow tie is uneven with the right side much larger than the left. It's just a hot mess.	-1
Kids find it interesting but it is expensive for what you get. You need to buy ants and sand separate.	-1
I bought this with fond memories of my childhood lightbright.  I honestly thought my 5 year old son would love this.  First, it's really cheaply made.  Thin plastic junk, typical of the toys coming out today. The drawer is convenient, but sticks.  Almost every time we've opened, pegs have gone flying everywhere because of the difficulty in opening the drawer. It is battery operated.  You press the button and it automatically shuts off after 3 minutes.  I'd prefer the electric type to this. It doesn't stand up well, if at all. You can't push a peg in without holding it or propping it against something.  It's just not the toy I remember.  I wouldn't buy this again and I definitely would not give this as a gift.	-1
When you open the tray to pick out the little pebbles the whole tray spills out the little pieces all over the place.	-1
I believe this is the same lite brite I have.  In any case, it required 6 D batteries and to buy that many batteries is about $18, so I am no amused that to play with this you need to spend 2x more.  I have never put any batteries in it and it sits in my closet.  Not worth it.	-1
This is not the Lite Brite I remember. The basics are the same, but the details of this new version are very irritating. First of all, the light has no "off" button, so once you push the button that turns the light ON, it stays on for 3 minutes, whether you want it to or not. So if you like taking a quick peek to see how your creation is coming, but then turning the light off so you get that "surprise ooh ahh" moment in the end when you finally illuminate your picture, you're out of luck. The light goes on, and stays on. (Unless you remove the batteries from the back, which is hard to do without making the pegs fall out.) Also, the handy-dandy peg holder is almost impossible to open. My 3 year old can't make it budge, and I can only open it with difficulty. Bad design. Also, be sure to have 3 D batteries handy (ka-ching!) when you open this up, or your kid may be disappointed. I personally would prefer a plug. I wish these "improvements" actually improved this toy, instead of making it more frustrating!	-1
I bought both this and a companion super size bubble machine from the same manufacturer. This one worked the first time used, but never again. The tubing was no longer sucking the fluid from the resevoir. I tried everything to fix it without results. To the trash.  The other super-size bubble machine NEVER worked from day one. We tried every which way from Sunday to get it to work, but to no avail.  Waste of good money on a very poorly designed and unreliable toy.  Won't ever spend money with this manufacturer's items again.  STRONGLY DISCOURAGE PURCHASE!!	-1
We have a set of American-made corrugated blocks, and we love them. We wanted more bricks for more fun. I bought these thinking it was the same set, but it's not.  These are Chinese knock-offs (as are the Melissa & Doug), and the quality is inferior.  (Amazon should really list country of origins just as packages are required to do.) The cardboard is lighter quality.  Worse, the printing is glossy, not matte, which sounds like nothing except that the added smoothness destabilizes a kid's construction. The block mix is HEAVILY skewed to the small blocks, which kids don't really like or use anyway, so the block count is a bit bogus. (Honestly, kids only use the small ones when they're out of the big ones in my ample experience.) My advise is to look for the real ones. I think ImagiBricks is the US-based company, but it's worth double-checking. You could do worse than these bricks - even bad blocks are better developmentally than no blocks at all - but you could do a whole lot better too.	-1
It came all broke in the box. Had to glue it back together myself.  Was a Christmas gift so I wasn't sending back.	-1
Honestly, I'll say it...these are not the funnest blocks in the world.  I personally find them frustrating, unforgiving and rather limiting.  I don't find that they help to spur the imagination much.  Give me and my kids plain old blocks any day, or a nice construction toy like K'nex to play with.  These are an okay block if you don't mind precision fidgeting and constructions that fall down like dominoes, I suppose, but neither me or my kids enjoy that.	-1
We just received this and could not wait to put this together. The instructions were easy to follow however you will need to convert the water amount.  It tells you to mix but it does bot tell you that you only have 15 secs to mix before it hardens.  The stick was flimsy and I could not mix well. By the time the top was a paste as instructed, the bottom hardened.  What a freakin waste of money.	-1
I didn't follow the directions so o failed to create the volcano. I guess that's what I get for trying to rush through the project. I'm gonna order my fighter another one and retry because I really feel like this kit is good quality compared to others I've seen	-1
Cheaply made.  Don't recommend.	-1
Buy some pop and mentos and forget this.  How disappointing for the child who just painted this thing to watch it NOT erupt.	-1
the cast was so coarse, and the plaster was very hard to mix and pour.  I got bunch of waste instead of mountain.	-1
We got two of these for our girls.  We doubled checked to make sure all of the sides were nice and tight yet when we poured in the plaster, it leaked all over the place.  My girls were very disappointed.  They ended up just painting the plastic pieces and using the little plastic tube to make the volcano in, but I wouldn't recommend this.	-1
not what i expected....  does not  look like the picture when flames go up.... save your money.... my kids did not enjoy it at all...	-1
Not only did I end up throwing everything away after 10 minutes, but I got the whole kitchen dirty with plaster, a good spoon covered in plaster, and threw away a good bowl covered in plaster.  They warn you lots about painting, but say almost nothing about the mess about working with plaster.  I measured 280ml of water per instructions and the paste was too thick.  I tried thinning it with water but it was too late.  It was hardening very quickly.  I tried pouring it as is but was too thick.  Got plaster everywhere.  Forgot that it can't go down the drain and got the sink clogged up.  Good thing for Draino, which cleared it up.  This product isn't what I thought it would be either.  I thought they would provide some chemicals, but they just provide the mold making materials.  Go get vinegar and baking soda yourself.	-1
Stamp ink was almost dried out when I got it. It only lasted 1-2 uses and officially dried out of ink. Dissapointing	-1
Received as a gift and all the ink was dried out. Not much fun when it doesn't work out of the box.	-1
The ink pads were completely dry	-1
Great price and great product. I see this around other shops for triple this price. I can say I have a happy daughter!	-1
Good toy.  Wish it had a better storage message - just a box, no lid or anything to help keep items together.	-1
The ink on both sets ordered were DRY!!! Did not work at all and very disappointed with it. My kids were sad they couldn't play with them right away. Have to wait to go get new stamp ink pads :(	-1
the ink pad is dryed out. waste of money.	-1
The stamps come out REALLY light. So light that my daughter basically never uses this. And the wooden box is cute but as other reviewers mention it doesn't have a top so the stamps fall out, get misplaced, etc. Skip it.	-1
The stamp pad was dry! Tried to wet it, and it made no difference. Kids were yet again disappointed with a product like this. :(	-1
They were and still are dry. We tried to moisten them  and were unable to.  The biggest surprise is that they are Melissa & Doug.  Check, over the years I buy everything Melissa & Doug promote because of the quality.  Why didn't I send it back.  She's been complaining since Christmas.  Today I finally got to see firsthand.	-1
So disappointed in the Melissa and Doug stamp sets I bought for my daughters arts and crafts for Christmas. I am now going to have to purchase an additional stamp pad for her to get any use out of the stamps. The color pencils were a nice addition to this set, but I have yet to try to sharpen them. My guess is that they are going to break while being sharpened. Will update.	-1
Really, your gonna give your child stamps and ink? My wife is crazy, but if you don't care about ink and stamps getting on everything, including the nice floor that you spent hours sanding and putting a nice finish on, then go ahead. Really, I shouldn't care, they're only little once and kids really enjoy this stuff. I'd give it 5 stars at the kids point of view, but I don't like the mess and it's a parents review.	-1
The ink is awful!! Plan to buy refill ink immediately. The stamp shows up so light on the paper it's really hard to even see it. The stamps themselves are adorable and the only reason we didn't return it!	-1
Disappointed---and huge let down. My daughter was so excited to open this up and start stamping...Unfortunately it had 2 dried out stamp colors. For the amount of money it would be expected that a stamp set has working stamp ink. Since we opened it we cannot return it.	-1
While the stamps themselves seem very nice, I was disappointed by how poorly the ink pads worked.  I have been trying to find a new ink pad that my daughter can use to replace the one this stamp set came with.  The colored pencils seem fine though.	-1
UPDATE: I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE TO ENGLISH ON WEBSITE. COMPANY RESPONDED TO MY COMPLAINT AND PROMPTLY SENT A FREE REPLACEMENT. VERY GOOD SERVICE  My daughter loved this ball so it was very disappointing when the handle broke in half down the center!! She only had it for 9 months. I am unable to contact the company because everything is in Italian on the website. I tried to send an email, however, I am not sure I will receive a response. There is no telephone number listed either.	-1
As a school counselor I teach career lessons. I use these cards to help with my career lessons.	-1
Extremely small. I was a bit shocked. Quality is that of something mass-produced. Would not recommend. There are better options out there.	-1
I was sent the spanish version of this game, and no where did it indicate this.  I didn't realize it until after it was opened and all packaging was thrown out so I could not return it.  Be careful who you buy from - you never know what you might get.  I hear this is supposed to be a great game too.	-1
Cute idea but house is poorly made. Won't stand up unless propped and falls easily when trying to play with it.	-1
After a few weeks the chain became loose and after tightening the chain it just will not keep tension on the chain. I was one day late on reterning it so now i have to go thru The Bike Company. G.L	-1
Worked once and will not charge or tun snymore. Just purchased for Christmas 2017. I cannot get any details for contacting seller, extremely disappointed!	-1
Bike only worked for two weeks. Im not sure what to do about it. I got it for my son for his birthday and its already not working.	-1
I purchased this bike for my son's birthday.  It broke the next day.. gears would not engage.  Amazon was kind enough to replace it.  A month after I put together the second bike this one also stopped working with the same problem, gears will not engage and this time I could clearly smell something burning.  My son weighs 80 pounds, well within the weight limit and I supervised him and he was not doing crazy stunts on the bike... just driving around.  VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  Obviously there is a serious defect in the manufacturing because this kind of thing should not happen.	-1
product arrived in perfect condition .  I would definitely not recommend this seller to future customers and would purchase items from them again.  I was very upset because this item wasn't cheap and my child found a pink one and decided she wanted a pink one so since Santa cant disappoint we got the pink one  We didn't even have this product 2 weeks and called to send it back and they wouldn't let us they said because of the battery acid well we were very confused because they shipped to us.  Also they were very rude and informed us that we need to learn how to read the fine print of course we didn't because we had never had a problem returning to anything to Amazon before.  So if you aren't sure this is exactly what you want or it comes damaged you're stuck with it so be aware	-1
Customer service wouldnt warranty a bad rim for us, so I had to buy one...which was out of stock. So was every other part for it.  I get the rim with tire, and THAT TOO bends the first day. I was watching my son on it, he's inder the weight limit and never hit anything on it.  Next, the charger stopped operating. I'm an industrial electrician (same schooling as construction but more intense in motors and controls) so I checked it out. The battery wouldnt hold a charge and the charger doesnt output anything. so, its wheelless and in the corner of the garage.  Total run time: 5 hours.	-1
Improperly cut sleeves made it pretty hard to double sleeve, and yet only one out of the first 100 pack actually fit nice and "perfect". (Yes, my cards are considered standard size.)	-1
Very thin. Penny sleeves for $4 ... Not worth it.	-1
Waste of money.	-1
Broke way too easily	-1
These cars are really cute and are fun but only lasted ONE hour before breaking. The spring in the seat that ejects the drivers are stuck or broken down in the toy so they don't eject at all on either car. Each car takes 3 batteries and each remote takes 2 so that's 10 batteries for one toy.... I could look pas the batteries if this  product was good quality and my boys could actually use them, but that's not the case. Very disappointed.	-1
Very disappointed in this purchase. My kiddo was so excited when he opened it on Christmas and was so disappointed that the orange car didn't work at all. It's such a cute idea, just not sure that it's very well made.	-1
A blast for a couple days, then quit working. And we weren't rough with it. Too late to return.	-1
This was a birthday present for my 5 year old grandson.  Right out of the box the the screw to open the battery compartment on one of the cars was stripped.  We had to use a special tool to remove it.  That should have been a hint at what was ahead.  Next a single controller controlled both cars at the same time.  We tried everything to get it to work.  There is an on/off setting with a 1 or 2 choice also.  Like I said, we tried everything.  He was having fun running both cars so oh well, fun was what they were made for, right?  Within two or less minutes, one car would not hold the "driver".  It was constantly releasing it, even without hitting.  So he removed both drivers and continued to play with the cars and one controller.  Then one care just started spinning around.  There is a little button to adjust the direction of the car manually on the bottom so we tried resetting that with no effect.  By the end of 30 minutes, it was so frustration that we made him put them away.  I would send them back but as they were purchased a while ago to have on hand for his birthday, it is now too late.  It was a rather expensive 30n minutes of fun.  My recommendation is to not waste your money.	-1
Broke first time Kr was used	-1
It does work as advertised, but the cars are too difficult to control, they won't go straight, and the turns are way too sharp, Even adults won't be able to control them, not to mention kids. Good concept, bad execution.	-1
Really cheap.....missing parts, poor packaging.	-1
Did not work.	-1
Kid Galaxy makes awful RC toys.  Bought this and another product on a really good deal $6-8 each.  About what they are worth, considering the car moves an inch and stops and repeats when you push the button to make it go.  My tolddlers lost interest quickly.  back to amazon they go.	-1
Fun for an hour or so until they break.  Very poorly made.	-1
I bought it for a gift for grandkids. They took it home and live 3 hours away. They said it wasn't working well. They will try it again, but if not, it was a waste of money. I should have tried it before they left because now I don't know how to return it since I don't have it.	-1
These cars were defective from the get-go. Did not get a single play out of them. Disappointment!	-1
This is very hard for a young child to maneuver. I was expected it to be much easier to operate.	-1
There isn' enough variety of peices in this set. my son tried to build stuff with it, but there aren't enough roof peices or smaller peices. Just tons of big peices. I tried gettting creative and playing with them with him, but I soon realized that you just really can't put anything creative together with the lack of peices. I ended up donating the whole set to good will.	-1
Never really worked that well.	-1
Chino crap, doesn't work on carpet.	-1
I purchased this is a Christmas present for my son, and thankfully I took it out to put batteries in and test it before Christmas morning because it barely worked and I had to send it back. I made sure that it had new batteries of the same brand as the instructions said, but the car would not move unless you got about an inch or two away from it, then it would only go for about a foot before it stopped and you'd have to get real close to it again. As you can imagine, it was pretty frustrating! For a toddler it would have been basically useless.  I'm not sure if this is a design flaw (I didn't see anyone else complain of the same issue) or if I just got a defective unit. Either way, I'm not terribly impressed.	-1
Tried several times and it didn't really work all that well, let alone with the kids trying to drive it. Controller wasn't all that easy, on/off hard to see/ use and eventually broke off and I had to cut away a piece of the car to access the stub that was left. I'd skip this brand, or at least this model. I eventually just threw this (and the amphibian one) out.	-1
Not even a year old and I've thrown them away.  Hard to use.  Seldom worked.  My son lost interest each time they'd break down.	-1
arrived broken!  Threw it away because we were out of town at the birthday party.  So mad!	-1
Worked for about a month.  Then one of them stopped working.  My husband tried fixing it, but no luck.	-1
The remotes operate both cars.. the switch doesn't work.. kids quickly lost interest.. plastique	-1
Terrible.  One does not work at all.  So not happy!	-1
The cars move pretty fast and are very sensitive to the remote but unfortunately they're not as durable as I hoped. Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.... the kids played with them for a few hours, bumping them into each other until the orange car broke.	-1
Let our kid drive it in about 3" of water and it stopped working. Took batteries out, let it dry out, still won't work. The alligator one we ordered kills batteries in 2 hrs. Do not recommend.	-1
I bought a couple things like this a few years ago for my sister's kids and they were awesome.  So I got these for my own kids, and thought I had found the same toy.  But this is not the same toy.  They are cheap, poorly put together and break easily.  They are hard for little kids to drive as it takes some coordination to use the controllers that adults would find challenging at first.  Maybe if the toys worked right my kids would have got it, but early on one of the wheels did not respond to the controller's commands, and soon one whole side stopped working.  I think the original toy that I bought for my sister's kids was made by Fisher Price and was solid.  But they discontinued them.  This is some knock off, not a recognized brand.  They came in plain cardboard boxes with instructions in English and what I think may have been Chinese (not sure).  If you can find these made by a recognized vendor, get them.  They are awesome.  But this knock off version does not last. :(	-1
Needed too many batteries for each piece to work. Children could only play two days with toy set and it was done in. It was cute and gadgety ish but not sturdy enough for my rough gang.	-1
you need batteries for every single part of this toy.  lots and lots of batteries	-1
I hate to write bad reviews, but I don't want anyone else to waste their money. This is horrible. My 6 year old granddaughter wanted an RC car that was hers to play with. I thought this would be tough and go on grass and gravel as well as working in the house. It would barely run on the cement driveway downhill. It acts like the batteries are half dead when they are brand new. It will not go even in short grass or gravel. It has no power and you have to be right behind it or the controller stops working. These are not expensive, but don't waste a dime on it. It's a piece of junk. DO NOT BUY.	-1
This broke almost immediately after my son opened it on his 4yr old birthday. I did get a quick replacement but that one also broke after a handful of uses. The problem is the car can be driven in water (we have a pool), which is very cool, but the remote can not get wet. This concept is a bit difficult for toddlers and preschoolers. It's a poor design. The entire thing, including remote, should be water proof. My son did love playing with it and was quite disappointed that it continues to break.	-1
Such an awesome idea -- if only they actually worked!  I really wanted them to, so I ignored all the reviews that said they broke quickly and ordered them.  My kids had a fabulous time with them for one night -- the next day one of them was broken.  I am returning them.	-1
Nice toy, but the battery does not last.	-1
they did not last to long and they gave out.	-1
They loved it!  Unfortunately, it lasted ALMOST all the way through Christmas Day the one stopped working.  Wouldn't buy it again.	-1
This was a gift and truely enjoyed. The boys barely had the toy for a month and already one of the cars won't go despite new batteries being put in..., i guess it's the motor that went. Will try to call Kid Galaxy to see if they can replace.......	-1
OUT OF THE BOX, THE STEERING GEARS LOCKED UP AND THE PART THAT TURNS TO AIR FLAPS WAS BROKEN OFF.  SO I DID SOME RESEARCH AND IF THE TOY IS DROPPED FROM EVEN A FOOT OFF THE GROUND, AND IT LANDS ON THE TAIL END, THE FAN FLAPS CONTROLLER IS PROBABLY BUSTED.  ITS A SHAME ITS SO FRAGILE BECAUSE I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING WITH THIS TOY WITH MY SON ON COLD RAINY WINTER DAYS... I ALSO READ REVIEWS THAT YOU MUST HIT THE BUTTON ON THE SIDE WITH A GOOD PERPENDICULAR ANGLE IN ORDER FOR THE DRIVER TO POP OUT. SO HEAD ON CRASHES IS NOT THE GAME, ITS ONLY VERY VERY PRECISE SIDE IMPACT COLLISIONS THAT WIN THE GAME.  GREAT CONCEPT, NEEDS BETTER ENGINEERING.	-1
I own a lot of radio control devices, the concept is GREAT, these little things are quick and can scurry all over the place...BUT YOU CAN NOT CONTROL THEM worth a darn; they don't track straight and the little adjustment/alignment dial does nothing, it actually broke with a bit of pressure. The kids still loved it but with my not being able to control the direction it was aggrevating. GREAT concept but once again China screws-up in delivering a quality product. I'll let the kids play with it a couple weeks and send it back!	-1
This product is of poor quality and my son never plays with it.  I wouldn't  buy it again.  It's just a piece of junk that takes up space.  It uses a lot of batteries.  Overall, it's a good idea poorly executed.	-1
Maybe it's just us, but so far these are crappy.  Can't get them to consistently work or even get the signal from the remote. Still playing with them, but was a waste IMO	-1
Very unhappy with this purchase.  Lots of problems and they never worked properly.  Very frustrating for my kids.  Ended up in the trash.  Don't waste your time or money on these.	-1
Most boys in the 5-7 year group (and some girls) love the idea of bumper cars, and also things flying off when things crash together.  On the face of it then this would seem to be good toy for that.  However... the steering is quite tricky for youngsters (think a steering wheel would work better than double joy stick), they only crash when you hit the buttons on the side just so, and they just aren't very durable.  We've had ours for about 6 months and they are both already done... controllers and cars just don't work (I think the plastic gears buried inside have come unseated).  For $30+ this seems like an expensive proposition for short lived toy	-1
Bought this for Christmas and after two gleeful play sessions one of the cars was broken (flimsy gears) Three college educated adults tried to rebuild...and were unable to fix it. This toy is very poorly constructed despite it's price.	-1
Returning this toy today. I should have listened to the other reviews - it's such a cool idea, but a low quality product. Not only does it take 10 aaa batteries, but they were all used up after only a few plays (and with a 5-yr-old's attention span those weren't long plays). The characters are tricky to get into their cars, and the release buttons work inconsistently. Even my husband and I had a hard time learning to steer the things. Still looking for a good quality remote toy for our son. Don't waste your money, time or batteries on this, keep looking!	-1
Fun idea, however 1 of the 2  bumper cars didn't work well at all--wouldn't move either on floor or carpet or moved only very slowly on floor although we couldn't figure out why.  Great concept but unfortunately, not consistent. Wouldn't recommend.	-1
This is a laugh-out-loud fun toy, BUT, be prepared for the fun to end abruptly because the toy is poorly made.  Our blue car quit turning left after just a few play sessions.  Also, the toy gobbles batteries, using several at a time--some in each car and some for each remote.  The batteries in the cars only last through one playtime.  It is lots of fun while it lasts, but I wouldn't recommend it, nor would I have bought it knowing what I know now.	-1
I hate the fact that I ordered a this transparent Blue accordion and received a solid blue one. Worse than that it has scratches and something in it sounds loose... Argh annoying.	-1
It is wayyyyyyy toooooo big who can use 14 feet by 10 feet and it is very light. I purchase a 48 peice that was 2 ft x 3 ft and wieghed more. Better look at measurements first	-1
I got this for my daughter and she loved it for a few weeks.  She took good care of it and it worked great for around a month.  Then it fell apart.  The mechanism inside came loose and it turned into a rattle toy.  I called AND emailed HOHNER with no response from the company.  TERRIBLE customer service if they don't return emails or Phone calls.  PIECE OF JUNK.  It scratches really easy and the vinyl trim comes loose as well.  It sounds good until it falls apart....  ;(	-1
Used to love this brand.  Our last dog puzzle had a missing piece, and customer service was great about replacing it.  With this one, the picture is tearing from two or three pieces,even on the first use.  It is hard (especially for young ones) to put together as it requires more pressure than usual. The pieces do not lay flat.  The finished project curves inward despite piling on heavy books overnight. I recommend Ravensburger-a bit more pricey but much higher quality.  Honestly, our last $1.00 puzzle from the discount store was far superior.	-1
This product was in terrible condition.  Some blocks were chipped and the printed butterflies were either mis-printed or were terribly faded.  It was sent back.	-1
This wooden bead set was confusing and if somebody buys this item than they wouldn't like it.	-1
This is a pretty good toy, and lots of fun for a three-year old, but the showcase items, the butterflies, are too wide for the string! What this means is that the string to put through the beads has a stiff plastic coating on the ends about an inch long to help push through the beads. However, the butterflies are longer than the plastic segment, meaning you cannot push the string through. The solution is to find something small and pointed, such as a jewelers screwdriver or a safety pin, to get it all the way through. Needless to say, this is a little time-consuming for both parent and kid, as well as meaning that kids cannot solve this safely on their own.	-1
My daughter is really enjoying stringing things these days and I thought this would be a great next step for her.  The reviews were all great except about the paint smell, which I wasn't worried about.  My daughter was so excited to try these and I thought what great string it has plastic ends which will make it very durable and easy to string...until I tried one of the butterfly beads.  The string goes in fine, but there doesn't seem to be anyway to get it all the way through the bead.  Once you don't have the plastic to push on it get stuck 3/4 of the way through!  So frustrating!!!  Now I have to go through the trouble and expense of returning it...maybe I'll just throw it away!  Very disappointed and especially in Melissa & Doug products not being cheap to begin with I expect better design and quality!	-1
The design is outstanding, but we bought it without checking the specks after being spoiled by and having high expectations for anything with the M & D brand stamp (no matter what the price, high or low), so I was disappointed to lies over that all m & d products are not of the highest quality and that now: The buyer must beware of average materials sold at premium prices.	-1
Ok, but the IDEAL my first magic set was so much better & had better tricks as well as some of the same ones. Just my opinion...	-1
I was disappointed in this product. My kids enjoyed two tricks but it is simple it lost attention right after.	-1
ehhh... cheesy tricks. doesn't really "teach" much of anything except maybe vaguely showmanship.	-1
Not great my son lost interest very soon after opening. There are better sets out there.	-1
Great quality, but my daughter lost interest fast	-1
My daughter was so excited when she saw this gift. She had been asking for a magic set. I had high hopes for it. To be honest we found this quite boring. My daughter played with it probably a handful of times and that's it. Kind of disappointing.	-1
I was looking for something easy that my 9 year old could do that wasn't too complicated. This claims to be for over age 6, however, the 'tricks' are WAY to easy. Seriously, a four year old could do these with no prob. Also, the quality is terrible. The first time we used the sword in the stone the wood piece that holds the metal piece inside (that releases the sword) came off! Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this at all, too cheap.	-1
Too many tiny pieces. Gets lost in the carpet.	-1
Way too big	-1
Ordered addition wrap-up, but received multiplication. Product itself is great, but not what I ordered.	-1
Sent these back. They are connected at the top. I wanted a set that was separated out, so multiple students could be working on them at one time.	-1
Ink ran out very fast. Poor quality, will not buy again.	-1
I don't know if mine was old and dried out but it was the worst ink pad I've ever used.  Waste of money	-1
Colors aren't very vibrant.  Some of the colors barely show up when stamping on paper.  Returned...	-1
Title says it all. Complete waste of money.	-1
Dried out pretty quickly	-1
The ink squares are too small for most of my stamps and cannot use with my alphabet or number printers I use at school.	-1
I really wanted the other reviews to be wrong but they aren't. These just don't cut it- I need to find better ink pads for kids stamps.	-1
The individual squares are small. Very few stamps would fit on them. Also the ink does not wash out.	-1
These are terrible ink pads.  Very dry.	-1
Really bad ink pad.  Not worth buying.	-1
The entire pad was dry.  Wasn't worth the shipping to return it.	-1
Great colors, big stamping squares, but bad idea due to the non-separation feature. Inks flow onto each other and mingle easily. I'd say this will work better for older kids who know they should stick to one color at a time OR clean out the stamps after each color use before stamping them on the colored squares. For most younger toddlers, in their excitement, they just stamp all over the squares hence it won't be long before you find a big mess on the neat stamp pad. Haven't used them a lot for this reason. Sitting on her toy shelves collecting dust. Wouldn't buy again/recommend to anyone.	-1
The ink beds are dry. Save your money and go buy stamp pads at one of the office supply places.	-1
I usually read reviews first but bought this hastily since it was so cheap.  I'd say I got what I paid for but basically its a coaster since there is no other use for this.  The ink is completely dried out.	-1
This product sucks, high price foracrappy product. The doesnt work well, seemslike its way to dry. Day one it was not a good ink pad. Ibought generic cheap offbrand ink padsat joann fabric for half theprice and those oneswork great, DONT BUY THIS	-1
I bought this pad for a christmas present for my 4yr old granddaughter. She loves craft items. We were very disapointed with the ink in this pad. I was going to return it, but before I could my grandaughter added water to the pad. Well, adding water was not the answer at the time. Still dry.  A couple days later she wanted to play with the pad and stamps again. The water helped for that afternoon. A couple days later the pad was a dry as a bone. Ending up just put them in the trash. I also bought the stamp and pad kit too.	-1
There wasn't enough ink in the ink pads. My 2-year-old couldn't press hard enough to ink her stamps and even I had to exert a lot of pressure to get any ink at all. We returned it.	-1
We only used this once and the ink then wasn't very wet, kind of dried out already. I stored it in a ziplock bag and the 2nd time we used it the ink was no good at all, bone dry. Waste of money :(	-1
This ink pad is old or manufactured incorrectly. There is almost no ink in the pad. We returned it for a replacement. The replacement was also defective. We know it is not working as it should because we have another of the same brand that came with stamps that works perfectly. Very disappointed.	-1
I opened it, hoping to use my new stamps with it when I am grading papers, and none of the ink shows up on the papers! it's the worst one I have ever seen. I thought maybe it was just that color so I tried some of the other colors, but nope, it's all of them. I don't recommend this pad at all.	-1
I'm not sure why I got suckered into buying another Melissa and Doug art product since the children's watercolors were such garbage, but I guess I thought it would be hard to screw up a stamp pad. I was wrong. The colors are incredibly weak (which incidentally is the same problem I had with their watercolors) and don't show up when stamped. If the kids (aged 8, 6, and 4) pushed HARD they would show up faintly, but otherwise we might as well have been using invisible ink! I love the wooden toys by this same brand but I will never buy more art products from them. We are all very disappointed with this product.	-1
If you're looking for something bright and colorful that resembles a stamp pad, but won't allow your child to make a mess, then this is the product for you. If you're looking for a product that actually works, keep shopping. We've now purchased two of these duds, one on Amazon and one in a retail store. Neither one had enough ink to get a stamp dirty. I should have learned from our first purchase, but really didn't want to believe that Melissa & Doug would put their label on such utter junk. (They did.) I thought perhaps the one we ordered from Amazon was old stock or dried out while being shipped in 100-degree weather ... until the one we got from our local toy store proved just as bad as the original.  I'm still looking for an ink pad my 4-year-old can actually use.	-1
Three of the six colors were completely dried out upon opening the product.  Adding water to the pads did not help. Junk! **Update--Amazon sent me another one of these ink pads to replace the dried out one originally sent. The replacement ink pads were dried out, too. If I could give this a zero star rating I would.	-1
Although we usually have pretty good luck with Melissa & Doug products, I have to agree with the other reviewers: this ink pad is not worth the money. We were so excited to open our brand new ink pad today and guess what? It had already dried out. No ink at all. My toddler was very disappointed.	-1
Dried out, no ink, expensive, a complete waste of money. I tried adding water to it, to make it WORK, but it didnt, and it was done in two days. Dont waste your money	-1
I read the reviews, but gambled and ordered anyway, hoping all the complaints of dried ink pads were a fluke or a problem that's been addressed.  Unfortunately, nope. That's a big disappointment since our experience with Melissa & Doug products has so far been pretty solid.  Of the six pads, three were completely dry -- no color whatsoever. And yet the other three remained moist, and left vibrant imprints. Too bad.  I did try to revitalize the dried pads with a small amount of water (these being water-based ink pads. That didn't do anything but make the pads into soggy, colorless sponges.  It's frustrating to have to send a ten dollar item back, but I'm going to just on the principle of the matter. My recommendation is to hold off on purchasing this product until you notice these one-star reviews begin to "dry up." I'm hoping the company will reformulate or repackage these sets to provide a better product.	-1
I ordered this pad from Amazon to replace a Melissa and Doug stamp pad I had ordered from another retailer. The last pad I received arrived with dry ink. My new order from Amazon also arrived with dry ink. I am not sure I'll be ordering this pad ever again. Sadly, there aren't too many other options when it comes to washable stamp pads, but I can't stand spending $10 on another dry ink pad. Melissa and Doug should maybe double wrap their pads in plastic (or better yet, foil). Quality control on these pads seems to be non-existent.	-1
Only good as a party favor. No educational value what so ever. Dried within 5 days of being opened, even though the case was kept closed and in cool, moist environment.	-1
I may have just gotten unlucky, but the shrink wrapped stamp pad we received hardy puts any ink on the stamps. We had a 5 year old pad that was starting to dry out we wanted to replace and it works better than the new Melissa and Doug one. What a bummer. Such a pain to return. Just loss of $. :(	-1
I am not a fan of Monopoly at all.  Theres too much chance involved.  Once you learn a couple basic strategies that never change, you can win easily as long as you get good dice rolls.  With that being said, this game is way worse.  Created by a university professor, the goal of the game is to show how destructive real life monopolies are.  Its more of a statement on the economy than a real game.  Its highly unbalanced and pretty boring ultimately.  If someone tries to subtly inject their philosophy into something, I don't necessarily like the idea.  But its a while heck of a lot better than putting an idea out with a very lame and flawed game attached to it.  Two thumbs way down.	-1
Purchased for a 6 year old.  It worked only once.  We drained the little amount of water after the first use and dried it off.  Unfortunately, it didn't work the next time we tried to use it.  We returned and replaced the item.  Once again, it worked for one time only.	-1
Garbage.not what they say it is	-1
My daughter, a huge princess fan, got this when she turned 4. She loved the jewelry. Unfortunately, she didn't want to play the game. We tried it once and she was so bored, we couldn't finish it. In fact, the playing pieces got lost pretty quickly, but we do have the jewelry and she loves playing dress-up in them. The game is just not for every princess, but all the kids seem to like the jewelry.	-1
was bent out of shape not very real looking poor quality would not buy again	-1
It's a nice enough puppet that I bought for the Tucker Turtle training, but I am quite disappointed in the product description. It clearly says 10 inches and it doesn't even measure 9".  I'm not a happy camper because there are different sizes and I chose this one based on the written description.	-1
It's a good value given the price, how're the stitching isn't the greatest, there's dried glue on some parts, and the eyes are actually a little scary.  Not my daughter's favorite puppet.	-1
Paint is peeling from all card	-1
ordered 2 got the same cars in both packs	-1
2 stars because it's still cheaper than buying single hot wheel cars. See photos for the product condition of just one car	-1
I bought two sets, needless to say styles don't vary they were identical	-1
I'm in shock my packages were not present and Christmas present my 5 years. I need to know to do!	-1
Plastic feeling,looks like very cheap with bad quality,and package was damaged : (	-1
I was told these would be manual transmission style but they are in fact AUTOMATIC transmission style. Will return promptly as these are literally ruined.	-1
Their marketing guru did a great job to mislead customers, 60 ball (12/pack)  means 12 balls. If you think it is ok, ignore my post, otherwise be careful.. awful customer service ... they are sorry but can help you only for extra charge ...	-1
I ordered a pack that said it can in a bucket. mine did not!	-1
About 1/3 of the balls are dead on arrival. They do not bounce as high as the rest 2/3. I recommend Penn instead.	-1
not what they seem.  the seems r 4x wider than an normal ball and somewhat softer than Penn Green Dots.	-1
Break too fast. I have a German shepherd, and when he goes to fetch them they snap in half.	-1
I thought it was 60 balls.  Bought it as an xmas gift for my lab.  They are nice though we haven't had one ball go over the fence yet.	-1
This product title is intentionally misleading.  The impression is that you are buying 60 balls in packs of 12.  Another, similar product is correctly listed as "Gamma Quick Kids 36' Tennis Ball (12-Ball Pack, Yellow/Red)".  This product should be listed in the same way as "Gamma Quick Kids 60' Tennis Ball (12-Ball Pack)".  Further, the description is, I believe, intentionally propagating the misconception that they are selling 60 balls... The description uses the phrase "60 Balls" twice... No where does it EVER say that there are only 12 Balls.  It only mentions that there are 12/Pack, and with the constant emphasis on 60 Balls, the implication is that you will receive more than one pack.  Current Title "Gamma Quick Kids 60 Ball (12/Pack, Orange/Yellow)"  Current Description "GAMMA Quick Kids 60 Balls (prev. First Set Balls) are low compression, medium bounce soft training tennis balls designed for beginners. The slower ball speed provides more time to react and set up each shot for more consistency and control when learning. The softer feel makes learning more fun for children who may fear harder regulation balls. Quick Kids 60 Balls conform to the USTA QuickStart Tennis format standard for ORANGE tennis balls on a 60' court. ITF Stage 2 specification."	-1
My daughter was very disappointed as this product is small, seems to be cheaply made and barely does anything. Save your money	-1
My husbands parents got this for our son this chirstmas and he had wanted this toy soooo bad. My mother-in-law was able to get it for around $60 because she had some gift cards etc. This toy was not even worth that and the actual cost is way more. It barely walks much less trying to get the dumb thing to run. It supposedly has the speeds: walk, gait & run. It also supposedly has "sensors" that keep it from bumping into things. This thing is junk, it wobles and looks like its about to fall over any minute. It will not walk on ANY carpet (I have a very short tight weave burber and it won't walk on that) and my in-laws have hard-wood floors and it doens't walk good on that either. When standing still it does have some neat movements with its head and tail that are realistic but other than that its junk! It doesn't gaurd, or move on its own or any of the things its supposed to. Save Your Money!!!	-1
I saw this at Radio Shack, and thought it looked like a cool gimmick for a teenager...I wanted to choose between that and Robosapiens and asked for a demo.  The manager kindly opened one up and put the batteries in. That took about 20 minutes, pliers and a screwdriver. He had planned to repackage it if I didn't buy, but gave up on that idea halfway through; the packaging was pretty much destroyed as he got in. (Be warned if you buy and try to return this...)  Then he handed me the toy and the controller. The toy felt flimsy, as though made with a cheap plastic. I put it down carefully on the floor (commercial grade flat carpet).  I put it into demo mode. It waddled off, roaring occasionally. Then it fell over. I righted it, and set it going again. It fell over again. The movements were all slow and clumsy, and didn't look realistic. It reminded me of a large version of the inch-high wind-up toys. The carton description led me to expect much better.  It lacked the "cool" factor I was looking for. Rather disappointed after all that effort, I decided not to buy it. With the set-up time for a demo being so long, I didn't wait to see if Robosapiens was better.	-1
eeh!	-1
This was way too expensive for low quality pants and a tunic so dark you can't differentiate between the colors. The only reason he looks like a jedi is the light saber I bought separately!  Don't waste your money,  you're better off with some brown pants and shirt and a belt.	-1
As the size is 4-6 it is really small for this size, it fits to 3 years old.	-1
It's shorter than my kid's original arrows, thus it didn't work with her bow and arrow set. It's 6" shorter. So for buyer who's looking for a replacement arrow, this arrow may not work for you, as it is a very short arrow, may be designed for a small bow.	-1
The arrowheads - the suction portion was bent out of shape so they don't really stick properly when shot. It maybe just our package though. If the suction heads were not distorted, these would be great.	-1
Bought these with the bow.  Does not work well and would not recommend	-1
I purchased this as a gift.  This game is so fun and the grandkids love it, but  this particular one is toooooooo large and heavy.  I even had a hard time wrapping it.  There is a much smaller one that locks and can carry like a briefcase.	-1
Was very disappointed in this .It is very flimsy Don't think it would hold up very long .	-1
Boring toy...doesn't really do much and hurts when kids swing it around. I bought it for my kid's Halloween costume, but he didn't want it and doesn't play with it. Good quality and more "real" looking lasso than a lot of others out there, though.	-1
performs no tricks except getting me to buy it	-1
My daughter loved it but it broke within a few days. The Velcro piece broke off.	-1
We got a defective one - the one velcro loop still had some of the un-sticky paper on the inside of the loop, so it wasn't positioned where it needed to be.  Looks like a manufacturing issue.  Anyway, I noticed this was probably the case, and tried to fix it, but it still didn't work.  It was just for a halloween costume, so we looped it up and just attached it through his belt.  Could have done that with $2.00 rope from Walmart, though.  Pretty disappointed we wasted money on this!	-1
It broke in less then one day. My 7 year old daughter wants to be a cowgirl. So we got this for her birthday. I didn't even make it 24 hours before it unraveled and the Velcro fell off.	-1
Hard to use and understand for a child.	-1
Annoying rope. Didn't do a great trick, I was disappointed with the product. 5 family members worked with it, all disappointed.	-1
the velcro end came off after 2 days, so its a good rope to play with but i could have went to lowes for 3 dollars and got a piece of rope. the handle came off after 7 days and has a small copper crimper that is a choking hazard. I managed to glue the Velcro back on with gorilla glue but I took it back off because it sticks to hair to easily and is hard to get out. This is a DON'T BUY !	-1
This is nothing more than a rope with velcro and leather on the end so save you money. No other trick is possible	-1
There isn't much deluxe about this game except the increased price. The non-deluxe plastic tokens have been replaced with dumb semi-flexible figurines. The game board folds into six sections (instead of in 1/2) so it doesn't lay flat unless played on a flat hard surface. Forget playing it on the bed as nothing will remain level. The two plastic bridges and castle have no way to insert into the game board and tend to move around and get in the way of game play. If only the game pieces had been magnetic, and stayed where they were placed, then I'd consider this to be deluxe. There isn't even a card holder/discard holder. The cards have the word "Deluxe" printed on them, oh whoopy doodle!! The playing board is loaded with busy graphics detracting from the simplicity of the game. So if you like this game, save your $$ and get the regular version.	-1
My son does really like this toy and once we got it working right it was fun, but it's way too loud when the cars get launched.  My son is very sensitive to loud sounds and holds his ears every time he plays with this, but he does enjoy watching it and playing with it.  It could be a bit more sturdy than it is, but we don't really have a stable playing area.  Plus, this thing is huge, why does it have to be so big and cumbersome?  It takes up a lot of room in my sons bedroom. He has only played with it on for about a week, but he now just plays with it manually and likes to have the gorilla eat the cars and put them in the cage.  I know he's played with it, but not with the launch function.  Overall, don't expect too much out of this toy.	-1
My 5 yr old son thinks this toy is great, but after only 30 minutes of play the force of the Gorilla falling over backward had pulled the base apart to a point where the Gorilla only works now if I sit beside it and hold the base together while my son plays with it. He also got a set of strait Hotwheels track for Xmas like I had when I was a kid. He has alot more fun with that: putting books under it to make jumps; seeing how many cars can go down the track at once, etc... More entertaining, more imaginative, more durable. Sometimes simpler is better!	-1
I bought this toy thinking that my children would love to play with it since one of them LOVES mazes, the younger one (4) could learn tracing and having better coordination, but as for now, they saw the toy, tried to play with it and left it on the table. I insisted they play in another ocasion, but my younger one thinks is too hard and the oldest(5) one thinks is not fun.	-1
What happened??? I received this today and it looks old and used? The box I'd dented and mudtyy. The inside looks like this has been played with and put back.  I am sorry for the negative review, but I feel cheated .	-1
The instruments don't always make the noises when they are placed in.  You can't just pick one up and then place it back and have it work.  Often times we have to dump all of the pieces out, and only then, when putting each back in its place, do they work.  There used to be an older version of this puzzle at a play area my son used to go to, and that one worked like magic.  Even if the pieces were put back before the other songs finished, they would all start, so they could even play at the same time, which my son loved.  I don't know what they changed but I hope they go back to the way they used to make these.	-1

It's my first one so please bear with me.  The sound isn't as good as I would like it to be but I feel I can still be understood.  This should help you decide whether or not you should purchase this item for your child.	-1
it's a sound puzzle but there was no sound.  I gave this as a gift to my 2yo niece.  There was no sound because the battery was dead.	-1
Sounds like crap.  I plan to return it and buy a better brand.  Some of the keys sound OK but most of them sound very flat and some of the keys were sticking the first time we tried it.	-1
Trying to fix broken leg and lost screws and round silver disk that tops them.  tried to call 3 times to their service center, 1st time was told they would call me back with info...they did not.  Sent email, they said to call again & they could help me.  I called again and was told they were the manufacturer but did not supple any parts.  Told them I would be happy to buy them..They said NO they didn't do that & they never give any info about the company or their people in China?????  Why?  they have about 30 employees here in the states..over 1000 in China.  I have brought many of their products....I will no longer...what are they trying to hide???  Could there be lead or other band materials they are using for thier toys?	-1
Okay, so my 1 year old son was facinated with this piano. But it sounds horrible. I mean Awful. In fact, we were afraid that the sound, which is very and very and VERY off tune, will ruin his musical inclination. I don't mind the chime - but its too off tune. So we packed it up and back it goes.	-1
returned it... big and stiff and boxy.	-1
About >2.5" tall puzzle pieces where a letter matches with a real photo picture, which is why I chose it. The very first piece I pulled out to separate, the paper backing ripped off...and it continued to happen or for corners to bend. Actually quite typical of flimsy puzzles you can buy at the drugstore for a few bucks..and who cares since they're super cheap and generally made to be put together once! NOT what I expected for $12.55 total activity that's meant to be put together and taken apart repeatedly. Actually, my local drugstore has a nice flashcard set of real pictures. I could have bought two sets and glued them to cardboard and cut them out and still come out much cheaper. For $10 more I could have gotten the Lauri alphabet set and gotten a nice sturdy foam, and then just used the drugstore flashcards for seeing real pictures. I'm dissatisfied...I hate wasting money!	-1
when I first bought this i was really excited because i like to buy educational toys for my daughter, this puzzle is not worth the money its very cheap and breaks easily.	-1
Pictures are not vivid and appealing to 3 yr olds learning and poor quality.	-1
The product made terrible static, winding and grinding noises upon delivery. Had to return.	-1
Do not buy it arrived broke and dirty i go to put batteries in it and it doesn't work all i can hear is stuff rattling inside the globe part	-1
I can't believe this toy is being sold in 2016. It is not teaching your children about "the world," it is covered in viscious stereotypes about people of color.  The South African is a brown person carrying a diamond and smiling. How many black South Africans died in diamond mines? This is beyond insulting.  The person representing an Indian has a turban and is playing a flute for a snake, the stereotype of the "snake charmer" which should have been last seen in Indiana Jones 30 years ago!  This was given to us as a gift and my children won't be using it.  This should not be sold anywhere.	-1
Despite my admiration of the educational concept of the product (which is not bad,actually), my child would start hysterically crying when I tried to introduce him to this toy. When it moved, it was slow and loud. Bottom line. If freaked my kid out,so I had to return it. I was excited about the idea of my child learning about the world, different continents through such a creative way, using the controller (stick), watching pilot flying across the globe,but the noises that the toy made turned out to frighten him, so he didn't really care about any other features of the toy.	-1
I think I've had enough of VTech's toy products.  This Fly & Learn Globe toy is another example of VTech's good idea, poor execution business model.  The toy looks attractive at first glance, with a joystick, five playing modes, and several countries and cultures to explore and learn about.  Unfortunately, the joystick is awful and hard to use even for an adult, let alone a small child, and the content is very limited, providing little replay value once a child has played through the five modes, which takes no time.  The toy also feels flimsy.  There's so much VTech could done to make it a worthy toy, but once again, they seem more interested in getting your money than providing a useful toy for kids.	-1
First off, this toy is LOUD. I am not sure if other parents have noticed a disturbing trend in the loudness level of toys these days. This toy falls into this category. I have resorted to placing tape over the speaker holes to mute the loudness of the sound. I fear for my son's hearing.  Second, my son quickly played out this toy in about 20 mins and know shows little interest in it. And at $25, that's not good.	-1
When I first heard of this..I thought it sounded great. As a mother and teacher, I couldn't think of a better toy. However, I did learn some new things. For example, the Pacific Ocean is right next to Europe (Asia doesn't exist unless you are lucky enough to hit the 1mm spot that the globe will register as Asia). There is only South Africa..the rest of the continent...nonexistant! I expect better out of Vtech! Oh well..another toy that looks great, but is a waste of money!  Update: While in the store, I saw this again. I played with it while in it's box and it seemed to be great. Much more accurate. So, I returned my defective one for the new one. We've had the newer one for about a year now. It's great. My children like to toy..and it's educational. The toy registers the correct locations now. I guess we just had a defective one before.	-1
BOUGHT HER ONLY FOR THE COLLECTION. BORING. WOULDN'T BUY IT IT. NO FAKE FUR! TELL ME WHEN THEIR ALL STARTING TO LOOK THE SAME TO YOU??	-1
Most of the smell was gone from all of the sheets. It defeats the purpose to be a "Stinky Sticker" if there's no smell. Only the peppermint ones had any smell left.	-1
The honey, caramel, licorice smell HORRIBLE to kids so they never take those stickers. Avoid this multi pack and get only bubblegum, strawberry, apple and chocolate; those are the only smells from this company that kids like.

Our three year old loves his Shake and Go cars, so the Raceway seemed like a no-brainer for Christmas.  Unfortunately, this playset just doesn't live up to its promise and as a result, it's already collecting dust while the more engaging toys (Geotrax trains) get all of the attention.  Now, every child's tastes are different, but I can really see his point in this case.  The cars themselves are battery-operated and you rev them up by simply shaking them.  This is great for younger kids because it eliminates the hassle, mess (cords) and risk of electricity.  The longer you shake, the farther/faster they'll go - just set them down on the floor and they're off.  The Raceway guides them along an oval track, tallying how many laps each car has completed and even which car is in the lead.  The critical flaw here is that with just their own internal power to go on, the cars only race for a few short laps before your child has to pick them up and repeat it.  Also, it's very likely that one car will konk out before the other one does and since the track is configured for the cars to switch lanes each lap, this means that rear-end collisions are inevitable.  These collisions are loud, they potentially damage the cars and could even pinch your child's fingers if he/she isn't careful when reaching out for the stopped car.  Even without any collisions, the Raceway is possibly the loudest toy we've ever owned.  The squealing-and-clacking noise that the wheels make on the tracks is unfortunately so loud that it drowns out the cool engine sounds of the car themselves.  The Raceway has a nifty finish line that announces who's in the lead and how many laps are left, but it's useless since (1) the track noise drowns it out and (2) the cars can't possibly finish an entire 10-lap race.  Simply put, the Raceway actually limits how much fun your child can have with Shake and Go cars.  We enjoy them so much more out in the open - racing across the floor and driving around (and through) obstacles that we devise out of household objects.  The Shake and Go Raceway is a great product idea, but its poor design completely stifles that idea.  As others have accurately stated, just get the cars and avoid this waste of space and money.  PROS  * Sturdy construction and quick, easy assembly  * The cars themselves are a great toy - kids love shaking them, the real sounds that they make and the way they take off  CONS  * Self-powered cars need to be continuously recharged mid-race  * Exceedingly loud even when the cars aren't crashing into each other	-1
My 2 1/2 yr old son got this toy for his first birthday and has NEVER played with it. I like all the educational thoughts put into this toy (such as the shape sorting etc)....but even i'm bored by this toy when I try to get him to play with it.  There really isn't anything catchy or special about this toy to keep him interested (even now at 2 1/2). With Christmas coming up I think I may donate it to someone less fortunate.	-1
My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday. She is now two and a half, and still does not play with it. Going to get rid of it. Shapes don't stay in holes and fall out easily. Personally, not sure even what the point of this toy is. Loud and obnoxious.  Junk. Don't waste your money.	-1
I have seen some photos of this toy that have small curly strings holding the shapes onto the toy. The version we have the shapes are not attached to the toy. The toy itself seems fun my daughter does like it. The problem I have is that the shapes are small enough that she tries to put them in her mouth and they could be a choking hazard. They are also very easy to lose, and if you lose one the ladybug on top cannot come off. This said it was for 12 months and up on the package but I believe with the small parts it is not appropriate for this age group. I ended up taking the shapes away and they are pretty much useless.	-1
This is an obnoxiously loud toy.  Only purchase it for a kid if you no longer want to be friends with that kid's parents.  It is extremely loud, even with tape covering the speaker.	-1
We got this as a gift when my child was around 2, so 2013. It lasted about one month of non heavy use, and the music stopped playing, which then you really can't play with it anymore. You can push the shapes in and hit the lady bug to make the shapes pop out but that is about it. My husband took the whole thing apart thinking a wire was loose, and he could not figure out why it doesn't play music. I have put new batteries in, turned on and off, nothing. No sound. So we got about 1 month use out of it. During that month I will say the music was way too loud. Now that it is gone though, there is no purpose, because everything you push or move plays a song or has instructions. Otherwise it is cute and sturdy. Wish it worked. I have to add too, my kids are NOT rough on toys, we have had many that look brand new after 3-4 years off play, so it wasn't how it was played with. I have heard that company made a new version without the attached shapes, so maybe the music breaking will work again (seems to be common complaint at vtech) but I would not risk buying the version that is advertised currently with the attached shapes.	-1
My daughters (three and one years old) received this as a gift from their grandmother, and while I appreciate the thought this toy had to be the most useless waste of money that has ever been spent on them. Even with the volume at it's highest setting you can barely hear the voice, making it's educational value null, and the since the shapes stick into the side of the bug rather loosely they're constantly falling off and becoming lost. My daughters played with this a combined total of about ten minutes before it was thrown into the toy box abyss, and after six months has now made it's way to the donation pile. Vtech makes many awesome toys- this was just not one of them.  For infants and young toddlers, we recommend the Vtech Sit to Stand Learning Walker- it has survived four years in our household and is still holding up strong for baby number three. Well worth the money!	-1
My daughter received this as a 1st birthday present.  She is totally uninterested in it.  I keep it out, just in case she changes her mind, but so far it is a fail.  Save your $.	-1
This toy is so obnoxiously loud it's not even funny. There is no way to turn it down. I had to take the batteries out and let my son play with it without the lights and sounds. I don't mind toys with sounds but I don't like it when my sons toy screams at me.	-1
Someone offered this toy to my daughter about 1.5 years ago. She started to get a real interest in it around 18mo (before, she would just try to make it sing some songs). At that point, the toy broke -after little use- and would loop repeat an annoying music. Amazon had a great policy and exchanged it for free. The updated version does not have the links to the shapes. So the shapes got inevitably lost. The fun part of succeeding then pushing on the ladybug to free the shapes has been completely lost. So she lost interest very quickly although she was so happy to see we got a new working one. I felt so sad for her...	-1
We received this for a gift. What a waste of money; please save yours and buy something else.  The picture has a pull string, well ours didn't come with one. The main issue for me is that shapes...since they don't fit securely in the toy, they are just asking to get lost. The shapes don't "stick" in the shape spots very good, I'm always looking for something to grab on the toy to hold it steady so my daughter can pop them on, but i always grad the thing on top, which makes all the shapes pop out. Ugh. There are way better shape sorters out there -- check out tolo and battat. Forget this one.	-1
These sell new for $20 at Wal-Mart, Target, etc. Why would it be listed at such an outrageous price?  Am I missing something?	-1
When I first received the Crazy Legs bug, I thought it was great...colorful and clever. I loved that the shapes were attached so that you could never lose a piece. As my little guy got older, I released the string from the compartment that hid it so that he could use the string to pull the toy. Shortly thereafter, I learned a lesson...this is not a toy that you would ever want to leave your child alone with when the string is out of the compartment that hides it. Right before my eyes, my little guy rolled over twice and wrapped the string around his neck. It scared him and it scared me. Thankfully, it happened while I was in the room...I can't imagine what could've happened if I'd walked out of the room for even 30 seconds.  I was happy the toy had a string, but even before he wrapped it around his neck, I was surprised at the length. It's 27 inches and can stretch to 29 inches. Other toy companies' toys have strings so short that you can barely use the string or the part of the toy attached to the string.  I'd recommend that if you're going to purchase this toy, either don't use the string, or clip the sting to a length that makes it impossible for your child to wrap the string around his/her neck. If it weren't for the string, I'd be giving this toy a high rating.	-1
Most. Annoying. Toy. Ever.  My son is 10 months old, and I bought this toy and gave it to him about a month ago.  I was immediately sorry.  When you turn it on, it automatically sings this song super loudly about sorting shapes to the tune of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat," then sings it AGAIN before asking you to "follow" it in doing something or other.  It is the most annoying song known to man, sung in the most annoying way possible.  I know I'm overusing the word "annoying," but there is just no other way to describe it.  Granted, my son is too young to really do any of the things you are supposed to do with it, but when he hits the bug on top, all it does is say, "Uh oh," then repeats what it wants you to do and sometimes even sings that awful song again.  So I shut the sound off.  He does like to play with it without the sound on, but the switch turns on so easily that occasionally he turns the sound on, and I die a little inside.  I really should just take the batteries out.  Also, the toy at one point yells out in a kid's voice, "Let's sing, Mommy" in the most annoying way possible.  I find it somewhat insulting that only "Mommy" could be playing with this toy with her child.  What about Daddy?  Or Grandma?  This is not an equal-opportunity toy, I daresay.  Perhaps the sound on mine is messed up, but it's really hard to hear what it is they want you to do on each mode.  (Trust me, I do not have hearing problems.)  I even tried to figure out the tasks, but the toy would tell me I messed up and sing the stupid shapes-sorting song again, which did not help matters.  I think this would be difficult and frustrating for a young child.  Maybe I can re-evaluate this toy when my son is older, but when I think about his older cousins, it seems that by the time he's old enough to play with it, this toy won't hold his interest for very long.  I may also have buried it in the backyard and sprinkled it with holy water by then, anyhow.  Thank God I bought it used and didn't pay very much for it!	-1
My son got this toy for his 1st birthday (he is now 18 months).  He does enjoy playing with it because it sings and he dances to the music.  However, this toy is confusing because it does too many things at once.  If you push the top down, all the shapes pop off and she asks to help find the shapes.  If you put the square back into the square, it says "square." That is, if the toy doesn't roll at all.  Every time it rolls it starts singing "come along, let's play along, let's take a learning journey..." So, the learning experience is actually over.  I have tried to play with it and can not manage to put all the shapes in without it starting some other annoying song.  It also has a lot of buttons and each one does a separate thing. My son ends up getting overstimulated and throwing the toy.	-1
For my son this was an over-complicated and exceedingly annoying pull toy. That's all he ever used it for. A couple of months ago the battery cover and batteries disappeared at some point. This was very odd since we keep tings tidy and don't lose the little pieces to almost any toy. Especially ones that need a screwdriver to be removed. I may have removed it and thrown it out the window in the middle of the night while sleep walking in a desperate attempt to eliminate the evil sorting song from my life forever. I should have noticed that the song stopped and life was brighter, but I can still hear it in the back of my mind. Sometimes I hum it in the shower. It sticks with you forever...you'll never forget it...I'm warning you now. Don't let it into your home.  I came online looking for a replacement battery cover. After all, my son is now 2 1/2 and perhaps now he can get the unnecessarily complex shaped pieces to stay in their delicate holsters and use this toy for that which it is intended. But sadly, the Vtech website says they're out of stock. Then I checked out Amazon and came across this product page, noticed the 2 star rating and was comforted to see that I'm not the only soul tormented by the sorting song that has come to this planet to destroy civilizations and implode the sun. Then I thought, "What on earth am I doing???" and threw the stupid bug with it's stupid baby in the trash outside of the house where I never have to look at it again and am finally free of the catchy and pervasive chanting. YES!!!!  Sort, sort, sort my shapes...whoops!	-1
This toy is obnoxious, uninteresting to my child, and a nuisance to our household! And yet we got gifted with it TWICE. We never asked for this toy, but we got one for my daughter's 1st birthday a year ago, and then another 6 months later for Christmas. Thaaaaanks.  My daughter is two now and has never found this toy fun or interesting. The songs & words it sings are hard to understand, the buttons and legs are difficult for her to understand, it's bulky, and loud. Because of it's design, it's always on the floor, and my daughter leaves it in various areas. I can't tell you how many times I have accidentally tripped over it or knocked into it with something - each time it starts blasting, "SORT SORT SORT MY SHAPES, CIRCLES, HEARTS, AND SQUARES!!!!" - sometimes waking my napping daughter up and sometimes tempting me to pick it up and throw it through a window.  It looks like a clever, unique toy, but once you get it home it really is just a nuisance you can't wait to be rid of.	-1
I wish I would have read the reviews for this toy before I bought it.  It was an impulse buy from a local store.  Anyway, I agree with what some folks have been saying, it's very annoying.  It only has 1 song "sort, sort, sort my shapes..."  I never really gave much thought to the "whoops!" part when the top button is pushed but now that I think about it, it is a little harsh telling a baby "whoops!" for doing something that he's supposed to do.  But then again, he's only only 6 months old and I really don't think he cares what it says, just that it's a funny voice.  It is kinda cute, I like the bright colors, but I do wish it had the other three (red, orange and purple.) I noticed the string is a hazzard.  My son puts everything in his mouth and he could actually swallow the string (like a spaghetti noodle)which wouldn't be good.  I had to put it back in the battery box for now.  It does seem durable and with as much as he has drooled on it, it still works.  Overall, I would spend the money on something else.  I'm disapointed because Vtech usually has better toys than this.	-1
This toy is cute looking but the sounds and interaction are annoying.  The little intro song is a little creepy sounding and not fully understandable, and you have to listen to the entire thing before you can play with the toy.  The shapes are difficult to "sort" onto the body of the toy as well, because they have to lock into place, and the strings attached are a little tight.  In addition, the pull string is a little long which may scare some parents away.	-1
My mother-in-law bought this for my 1 1/2 year old daughter to play with when she came to visit. It was fine for the first hour or so, but after my daughter dropped it one or two times, the bug would not turn off, even when the switch was put to OFF, and it got stuck in one mode and would not go to any other mode. My daughter lost interest with it quickly after this happened. If this toy is designed for infants/toddlers, it should be more durable because lets face it, little ones drop things. My daughter has plenty of other electronic toys that have been dropped that do not damage like this one did.	-1
My 9 month old received when he was 5 months. It is not entertaining at all. My 2 year tried it out and was easily bored. Did last five minutes with the toy. The String is too short to pull on it. It not educational or exciting and it's annoying. My husband and I did not see the point of this toy we returned it within two days of receiving it.  There is no value in having this toy. Neither one of my boys were interested in the toy.	-1
I bought this toy a few days ago for my one year old son and just finished repackaging it to return it to the store.  We gave it a good try for a few days (I'd rather keep a toy that atleast has some potential than return it), but it was just too frustrating.  It seems they were trying to do too much with this toy.  Is it a pull toy, cause/effect toy, or a shape sorter?  Well it doesn't do any of those things well.  It doesn't roll well, the buttons are hard to push (probably in part because it is on wheels, but also even if you push the buttons all the way, it may or may not activate it), and the shapes come out when the wheels roll or the top button is pushed - accompanied by an annoying "WHOOPS!".  Part of the programming, but the "WHOOPS" & "shape-sorter" song is too frequent, seemingly random (you can't cut off the song with the push of a button) and very annoying.  I thought maybe my  son just needs to be a little older (he loves cause & effect devices & toys (remote controls, push button phones, dvd player, etc), but the "effect" part of this toy is way too inconsistent.  I think the most enjoyment he got from this toy was picking it up and tossing it.  I gave this toy two stars for the cute design & good quality - it's very solid & well made, but it is too annoying & I think you're better off buying some other toy(s) instead for your little one.	-1
My 22 month old had put his foot into the bottom right opening on the dinosaur 4 times in the last 2 days.  His entire foot has been stuck.  He is unable to remove his foot out of the hole.  It has taken both of his parents working together for several minutes to extract his foot out of the hole.  He became very upset and slight bruising to his ankle area where he has tried to remove his foot from the toy.	-1
My 7 mos. old daughter received this for Christmas (2006).  There are several flaws.  Although it is big and kind of wraps around the baby, her foot is right by one of the trap doors where the balls come out and so it gets blocked.  Also a big flaw is the center of it.  The ball sometimes gets stuck in there.  It needs to be more of a slope because the balls sometimes stop rolling once they get to the bottom.  And... the dinosaur head does not always go back to the "upright" position and so the ball sometimes gets stuck.  ALL IN ALL:  Needs to go back to the drawing board.  Then buy it.	-1
Our son got this toy when he was 6mths old and still at 12 mths he could care less about it. In fact the only use it gets is him crawling on it to get to something out of reach. He has played with it a few times but only because we were sitting right there playing with it with him.  The balls get stuck in the middle hole and our son likes the sound and lights and all he does it stick his finger in the hole and make the sound and lights go off without the ball.  Out of 6 mths he has maybe played with it five times (again because we were playing with it to get him to play with it) for about 2 minutes. Glad we didn't waste our money on it, instead it was a gift.	-1
This was a gift. I would not have bought it now that it has been here for months with little use. The kids just are not interested in it. The balls with different textures are a great idea but the holes are too small so the balls often get stuck. Another reviewer complained about the head coming off easily. I agree but that has not happened in my house since no one is really interested in this toy. Aside from boring and defective, the music is awful. This one is a dud...don't bother.	-1
This is a really terrible product.  It will not stay up and stable and keeps collapsing on itself.  I read the instructions to see if I was missing something and it said that some versions of this product come with a support pole and some do not.  Mine didn't and the thing won't stand up.  It's also nearly impossible to fold it back into the size of the box it came in.  I have fiddled and fiddled with trying (following the directions) to twist some of the wires in a certain way to try to get it to be a little more stable, to no avail.  I really wish I still had the receipt for this thing so I could return it, but unfortunately I  didn't keep it, so the next destination is...the trash.	-1
This toy is confusing for a small child.  First, the nose of the toy turns it on, press it again, and its a second type of game.  The sound quality is awful.  It sounds like they used a child to record the audio.  The kid must have had cookies in his mouth when he made the audio recordings.  There is no volume and no OFF switch!  "Hi!  Im countingmahcookie jar"  "Lets play a game.." " Can you fiiiiind the number.." "(other voice) SEVEN?".  If the kid puts in the correct cookie - too fast, it reads it wrong and then tells them did it wrong.  Then it keeps pestering the child after they walk away.  Honestly I have dreams of running this toy over or blowing it up with an M80.  I would never buy this again.  My son got it as a gift.  It's awful.	-1
I bought this for my son when he was 2 years old.  He is now almost three, and plays with this toy very rarely (not even once a month).  I expected that the toy would work differently than it does.  Each cookie has a number on one side and correlating candy chips on the other side.  The side with the number has a raised circle.  The circle gets wider as the number gets higher (the number 10 cookie has the widest circle).  When you place the cookie in the jar a lever inside the jar is pushed a certain distance, depending on how wide the circle is.  That is how the jar 'reads' what number cookie your child is putting into the jar.  The only problem is, when my son puts in a cookie too quickly, the jar thinks it is a different number.  The toy plays in two modes.  For the first mode, your child can put cookies randomly into the jar and it counts the cookies, up to 10.  In the second mode, the toy asks you for a certain number.  For example, if it asks for number 3, your child would put in the number 3 cookie. However if they put it in too quickly the toy will say they put in number 2.  It is confusing to my son.  He put in the correct number, but the jar misread the cookie.  It has a pretty cute voice, not too annoying.  It does not have a shut-off switch, so we hear it occassionally talking by itself.  If the toy was designed better, it would be a great learning toy.  I would not purchase this toy again.	-1
Not good for kids 4 and under. Too loud! Hard to open and close to put cookies in and out. Save your money.	-1
The voice is annoying.  No volume control and no off button.  Poorly designed.  Not recommended.  Cute idea, but poorly executed.  We rarely play with it because it is so annoying.  Spend your money on something better.	-1
My two boys received this product as a gift.  For very young children is confusing and difficult to push the cookies in the toy  and for older children too simple.  It also has an attract mode where it will randomly start talking and has scared me several time at 3 am. There is no off switch.  An off switch should be required for any talking/electric children's toy.	-1
My son received this as a birthday gift.  It is very cute, but not as educational as intended.  In the mode where it asks you for a specific number cookie, the Cookie Jar often does not recognize the cookie correctly.  For example, I put in the number 8 cookie, and the jar says "Oops, that's the number 7."  I thought perhaps new batteries would help, but it does the same thing.  25 - 50% of the time, the toy does not recognize the cookie number correctly.  Very annoying and confusing for learning toddlers.  I do not recommend this to at all.	-1
Good concept but very poorly made. Some of the pieces had chipped wood and the sides were not completely rounded and I was afraid my son would get splinters so I ended up returning. My son loves the alphabet and I really liked the concept of it so I'm pretty disappointed.	-1
It's pretty straight forward but mine didn't come with the letter Q so it's a  incomplete set and it came with a uneven number of letters 5 b but only 1 p unless you turn the d's upside down.	-1
Okay this is the truth moms and dads, there are a lot of pieces with this. Pieces to get lost, pieces to dump out, pieces to have to look for. My 5 and 2 yr old played with this for about 1 day and then haven't touched it since. I thought we could use it to make other words too and spell things out but it doesn't have all the letters of the alphabet. Kids couldn't spell their names or anything like I thought they would be able to. My 2 yr old could say all the words and knew what everything was so that was good but like I said both my kids have no interest in this.	-1
Terribly disappointed! We were missing letters when it arrived. The directions say to give the child one of each letter, for practicing alphabetical order. We did not receive an m, r, t, or v. The puzzles don't utilize some of these letters, but r and t are necessary, and we have NONE.	-1
Too easy of a puzzle, my 2 year became board and rarely ever plays with it. Wish one side didn't have the picture of what your spelling on it because she knows what she's spelling before she even looks at the word since the picture is there.	-1
VERY DISAPPOINTED!! First the positive. Very colorful and for once the Melissa & Doug company cleaned up the pieces. Usually, your toys have wood shreddings and give  us splinters! I absolutely love the concept, BUT I am beyond disappointed at the selection of words chosen AND how few words there are to spell. This just came today, 4/19/16, and my 3-year-old is already bored with it!! She finished ALL of the boards in 10 minutes. I was expecting LOTS of words to spell AND sight words. I get so tired of feeling ripped off. Parents are really taken advantage of! Perhaps you can offer additional puzzle boards to add to a number of boards included. If you already do, please provide me with a link.	-1
Wish it were in capital letters - too advanced for my 3 year old who dosnt know lower case	-1
Unfortunately, the postal servicelost our package	-1
I'm not sure why this puzzle has such good reviews. Very few words to spell. A pretty boring toy. I'm not impressed and my daughter is not interested in it. I think the best use of this toy is playing with the letters and making your own words or making up your own game.	-1
My son kinda liked these boards, but there is no lid to keep it contained when not in use, why?	-1
I returned this.  I was really excited for this - thought it would be perfect for my son (who loves to play these sort of puzzles on my iPad - where he puts the matching letter on top of the block for it in a word-spelling game).  The letters don't fit - the S in mine had to be wedged in (I didn't try all the letters, but I tested multiple S pieces on multiple puzzles & it had to be wedged on all of them...which makes sense seeing as these are all machined using the same parameters).  The boards are also very very thin...nothing like any other Melissa & Doug product we have.	-1
I am a big fan of Melissa & Doug toys/products but this one was not a hit in my household. While I like the idea which is the reason I bought it, here are some negatives that I see: - Depending on the age of the child (mine was 3 when using it), it's easy to associate the picture on the "card" with the word being spelled. So, it doesn't really aid in reading or spelling. - The letter pieces are small and can be cumbersome to take care of. - There is no box for the letters, no cover for them either. This can be super annoying since they have a tendency to make a mess - It keeps the interest of my kids for a mere 5-7minutes. Not long enough!	-1
Sturdy and cute idea, but I opened this myself and I swear it did not come with any letter "e"s! I looked through all of the letters at least 4 times (before my kids touched it), and could not find a single "e". Plus, some of the puzzle "cards" specifically need e's (bear--for example). What the heck?! I will have to hide this as it will only upset my daughter..	-1
We got the product fast. No problems there. We opened it up and started playing with it and realized there was no k's and e's and there are plenty of words that use those letters. I called Melissa and Doug up and they said they would send the missing letters out. I'm still waiting!	-1
This is a misleading double entry-- buy from the main product page instead (I am assuming that the page was created in good faith and not in an attempt to actively mislead customers, but it is a higher-priced duplicate page at time of this writing).

Compare prices and judge for yourself.	-1
About a quarter of the wooden letters were not sanded down at all, had sharp strips of wood chipping off the back, or simply hadn't been cut out fully. We even received the tiny inner parts of some letters that were supposed to be discarded before packaged. Had I not been there with my daughter when she opened the toy she could have gotten some seriously nasty splinters.	-1
Not only did this toy not work, but I had a horrible time trying to get a new one.  Nobody carries it any more.  They must have realized it was defective and stopped making them.	-1
For the money we paid it is cheaply made. Xmas eve as we were putting it together we NEVER got the light up parts to work AT ALL.  WE yanked out the mirror many times, tried EVERYTHING to push it more firmly together but ALAS no light ups or cinderella :(. Knowing our daughter would still enjoy the talking part it was left out for Xmas half working. She does THOUGHLY enjoy it, and talks back to cinderella a lot. Loves to interact with all the pieces that salvaged it a star IMO. I konw even with the bugs we hate about it she will enjoy the toy a lot. My Husband had to pull apart the mirror take it to his workshop to try & make it work. When I say pull it apart I mean literally take the back off the assembled mirror and sanded the plastic connector down to make a better fit!  Even now only cinderella lights up. At one point we had lights and conderella but that stopped after it was bumped.  then it went on when pressed down.  But lost it and decided to suck it up and just celebrate our victory of finally reliably seeing cinderella.  He was paifully disappointed in the cheaply made  and crappy conection used for what "makes" this toy. It isn't hard to make an easier and better connecting system.  I got this on sale, not a big sale and it is NOT worth the money.  They need to go back to the drawing board and make it a bit sturdier and a DECENT easy connection for reliable function.	-1
We bought this for my huge infant because he reached the weight limit of his other movement toys and this could be used at nine months. We think it was a waste of money. It doesn't bounce well. It slides all over the place. He fell out of it more than once. The restraint really works best for smaller kids. At 9months he had really reached the limit and it pinched his thighs.  We sold it after a few months even though I am pregnant with our second. Not worth the storage space.	-1
This is an older game by Friedemann Friese, designer of the much-better and more popular&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Power-Grid/dp/B0007YDBLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Power Grid</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Copycat-Boardgame/dp/B00ATZXUL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Copycat Boardgame</a>.  This game reminds me of the old 1981 Milton Bradley game, Monster Mansion, that I had when I was a kid. Like that game, you have to escape from a haunted location (in this case, a castle) before you get eaten by the monster. You have four individualized player tokens per player, grouped by team and color, like the Addams Family, Scooby-Doo Gang, High School Kids, and '50s Greasers. The players are trying to avoid one of five different three-dimensional monsters that you create by snapping together parts (body, head, arms, feet): Frankenstein, Nosferatu (Dracula), The Blob, a skull-faced Zombie, or an Eyeball monster wearing a top hat. Alternatively, you can build your own monster by mixing up the different pieces. Not that it matters, since the different monsters all function exactly the same, although the variety of creature types is nice, and allows you to put extra monsters into the game if you have a death wish. There are movable stone pillars you can push or hide behind, and blood pools you can slide across to move faster.  What really sucks about this game, other than its simplicity (which is good for kids, less interesting for adults), is the movement mechanic. Each player token has two sides, each with a different movement point value. You begin the game with your token all on one value (a number between 1-6), then, after it moves, you flip the token over and it has a different move value on its next turn. The flipped value is also a number between 1-6, but if the top side is high, the low side will be a low number, and vice versa, so a "6" on one turn will be a "1" the next, etc. You keep flipping your tokens like this every turn. Only nobody can consistently remember to do this, and then you can't always tell if you've already moved a token or not. Why couldn't you simply roll randomly to determine your movement value each turn? So much simpler, and it avoids the constant player error associated with this game's wonky mechanic. You could easily just add a six-sided die to the game and use that for moving instead if you prefer, so it's not like you can't switch to that if you discover the same problem I did.  After all the players have moved their tokens, the monster moves. It has a cute "deck" of 10 blood-spattered tombstones you can shuffle, and they are flipped over once per turn to reveal how many spaces the monster moves. Two of the tombstones are labelled "move until kill 1 player" or "move until kill 2 players" (or until it moves a total of 20 spaces). The monster always looks ahead, left, and right, never behind, plodding ahead in a straight line one space at a time, then looking again until it sees a player or runs out of movement points. If it sees a player, it changes direction to move and (hopefully) attack if it has enough movement left. The monster kills you if it lands on the same space as you, and can push the pillars you hide behind off the board, squishing and killing you. During the first stage of the game, "killed" player tokens are thrown out of the castle and can re-enter on their next turn. The first stage lasts until the second to the last tombstone is flipped over, at which point, any further kills are lethal and killed tokens are permanently out of the game. Unlike the players, the monster can walk through walls, so if it hits a wall, it emerges on the opposite side of the castle (but on the same row of squares), continuing to move until it runs out of movement points.  In a 3-4 player game, you win by getting three of your four player tokens out of the castle's exit (opposite from where you enter). In a 5-7 player game, you only get three tokens and must get two of them out to win. This is why some of the teams (FBI, Clergy, etc.) have only three tokens, as they are only available in 5-7 player games. It would have been nice for Rio Grande to include a fourth token so these teams could be used in any size game, but oh well.  I don't find the game that fun or scary. The goofiness of the art destroys any real horror-mood, reducing it to the childish level of a Scooby-Doo cartoon. I played the basic game twice and easily won both times. The advanced game introduces more complexity like teleporters, but can't do enough to fix what is essentially a kid's game. The backstory is nonsensical and annoying to read with as many words beginning with the letter "F" as possible.  The game is not very challenging with only two players, gets slightly better with three or more, and supports up to seven players. Like all Rio Grande Games, the board and components are well-crafted, artistically consistent, and durable, though the monster's head often comes off when you try to pick it up and move it. Better to move it by its arms instead.	-1
I am sorry.  I just don't love this game.  Too much math and too little fun for me and my game group.	-1
I don't get this game. When playing with 4+ people a couple players will have no chance of winning because of their position on the board.	-1
I definitely paid too much for this toy. It simply doesn't capture my 4 year-old's attention. She doesn't have the patience for it, though she said she wanted it. However, children don't like every toy, and I can accept that.  However, one very legitimate gripe is that it only addresses writing capital letters. How to write lower case letters? Not even covered. For fifty+ ducks (yep I spent too much) I was expecting SO much more.  Also, a backlighting feature would have been nice. My daughter took this on a long road trip. She wanted to write in the car in the dark but she couldn't see what she was doing.	-1
You have to wait till it makes its monkey noise to tap it on the head and get it to walk.  By then its been flung around and on its back somewhere with wheels spinning in the air. Also if you have little kids, there are toys laying around. If it hits a toy, it knocks over and your back to my previous point. My 1yr old son does not find it very interesting.	-1
This was a total waste of money.  It had such rave reviews I thought it was a must have for my then 9 month old to have to encourage crawling.  This thing basically moves a few inches in one direction, turns and moves a few more inches.  The only redeeming quality it the cute monkey noises it makes (although some might find those annoying.)  It's not very sturdy, and falls over easily.	-1
I came across this toy during a search for outside toddler toys. I have very active 14 month old triplet boys, and I am looking for thing that they can play with/on together.  I would recommend this toy for a 6-12 month single child, rather than 6-36 months.  The item description indicates that children can play together, it's two small to allow enough wiggle room for that.	-1
We got this as a toy for my 1-year old son.  He rarely played with it because it simply was not engaging enough.  It had some sounds when a basket was made, but it used up the batteries really quickly.  Don't spend your money on this.	-1
I've never tried Little Tikes toys before so when Toys R Us had a sale (buy 1 get 1) I was like let's try them out. Got 6 things. The Sports Center, Tool Bench, Guitar, Xylophone and 2 30th Anniversary Coupes. EPIC FAIL on all except the coupes.  The toys are cheaply made with little to no thrills. They're essentially 1 dimensional toys with just the "play" factor. The ones that have sounds have a limited capacity with barely audible noise/music. I have been intrigued with most of my son's toys, this one lasted barely a minute out of the box before we moved on and opened another toy. Awful waste of money.  Why I didn't like the Sports Center: The scoreboard counts to 10 - then does a half cheer and resets to 0. That's it, nothing more - no music - no sound effects beyond a cheer - nothing snazzy or jazzy about this toy. The football - just spins, the baseball, the ball doesn't detach, the bat is lame. It's a very limited toy in the education department, things that he's been doing or learning with other toys.  What I'm going to do: Try to return it - if they'll take it back, if not, I'll just chalk it up to a loss  What I did: Went and got the Fisher Price Brilliant Basics First Baseball - so far AMAZING!! The ball is attached for baby's use now, as he gets older, the holder rises and he can swing the bat and hit the ball (coordination pending). Really recommend that toy instead of this waste of space Little Tikes Sports Center  What I learned: Stick to Fisher Price - Little Tikes is great for large toys (ride ones) but not so much for the little stuff. Do not get my money's worth.	-1
A friend gave this to my now 9 month old as a gift.  He pulls the net area and it tips towards him.  The football is just a rattle to spin.  the bat and baseball might as well not even be there.  When he drops the ball through the net, it makes cheering noises and adds points on the score board.  After 3 dunks, he's off to the next toy.	-1
My son received this toy for his first birthday.  My three year old niece had managed to get her arm stuck in the basketball hoop before my sister wrapped it for my son.  I thought that was just a fluke as my niece is very active and likes to explore.  My son likes the toy's music and flashing numbers on the scoreboard but isn't crazy about the football or baseball.  They snap onto the toy at the bottom and don't stay on very well anyway.  My son has had this toy for a month now and a few days ago he managed to get his arm stuck in the basketball hoop as well.  There is a small plastic wedge that depresses when the ball goes through the hoop that activates the music and lights.  My son put his hand down the hoop after the ball and the lever depressed, but once his hand cleared the hoop, it released, leaving him unable to pull his hand back up.  I was sitting next to him and was able to reach in and depress the lever enough to slide his arm out but it still scared him enough to make him cry, and he's a tough little guy.  I think this toy could be dangerous and my son is not playing with it until my husband takes it apart and removes that lever.  I don't know how much my son will enjoy then because there will be no sound or lights...there are better toys in this price range that are not hazardous.	-1
I bought this item because it was Dora. I was disappointed with quality of the plastic, compared to the Little Tikes kitchen. Otherwise, great idea if they improved the durability.	-1
The bed was just okay looked better in picture.	-1
I wish I had not purchased this. It's expensive for an item with the kinds of quality defects it has.  1. Canopy bars are not taught. The metal bars that hold the canopy up flops back and forth no matter how much you tighten the screws (I used an electric screw driver).  2. Canopy does not affix to the frame securely. As others have noted (wish I had spent more time reading reviews before purchasing), the canopy is tied to the frame with ribbons on the four posts. As a result, the canopy never stays in place and droops in the center. A mess. I am thinking of just removing the canopy and leaving it as a bed.  I would have sent this back had I not gone through the trouble of putting it together when I realize these issues.	-1
As others have reviewed the instructions are laughable.  It seems like a fun concept, but my kids have yet to by if a single project (ages 9& 7).  My 5 year olds snapped some pieces together to make a chain, that's about all the use it has gotten.  I expected something on par with legos and was pretty disappointed.	-1
Bought my kids these, magformers, superstucks and lincoln logs for christmas... the only ones they actually play with are the magformers and the superstrucks.. would NEVER buy these again...	-1
Missing key game pieces!  When I contacted the manufacturer they said its pribablt a counterfeit and they cant help me with any replacement pieces!  Too expensive	-1
Nothing worse than opening brand new game and finding only 5/15 of the train stations and a board with tons of huge wrinkles in the board face.	-1
Game arrived sealed, but when we opened it, the game board was moldy, the instructions are musty, and pieces (Train Stations) are missing!  A friend introduced us to this version and we loved playing it, so I purchased as a Birthday gift for my husband.  We were all so excited to play, now quite disappointed.	-1
Game is amazing, but insert is not designed for sleeved cards.	-1
I've tried several times to get my family or friends to get into this game and nobody wants to play it.  We start out and they all think it's tedious or 'not simple enough'.  I'm bummed out because I thought it would be fun to play leading up to our trip to Europe in the Fall.	-1
Very disappointed, dimensions listed were for the box and not the jeep. Two stars only because the jeep seems good quality; however, it will not work for what I wanted.	-1
Jeep portion is metal but top roll bars are light plastic.  Grandson loves it so will keep but the plastic top immediately broke into small pieces.  I tried to glue them but they are so thin and flimsy, it didn't hold.	-1
If you are looking for the "Elvis" pink Caddy he bought his Mother this isn't it.  That was what my Father thought he wanted. Fortunately my Father isn't techno enough to use the internet.  This is the caddy both I and my brother bought him for xmas. Yes, we bought him the same thing. I also bought him the God-Father Caddy to boot. We had him open my pink Cadillac last. He was very happy to have two "Elvis" Cadillacs.  However, if you want the true Elvis "bought his Mother" Cadillac, that would be a 1956 pink Cadillac de ville, which Franklin Mint discontinued and now routinely sells for $150.00+  I used to subscribe to the Franklin Mint cars for my father $39.00 a month. I did find an off brand true Elvis Cadillac for less than $80.00 but it was also a discontinued brand.  Good Luck!	-1
I got this toy for my son for Christmas. It looked really cute in the store. That's about all the value it had. We tried to get it running on our computer, downloaded all the software, hooked up the USB cable as directed and whammo! We kept getting an error reading "attach the cable agian and retry." we did this for an hour. Finally I called the 1800 number. They trouble shooted for a few minites and quickly said" you have a defective model. We'd be happy to set up a return for you." huh? they threw the towel in very quickly. So we got another one, and LOW  AND BEHOLD-  the same darned thing!!!!!  same error message. All elmo could say was HI JOHNNY and then fuzz... that's it. NO birthday, no friends names. We thought maybe it was our computer that was broken . Imagine? Could it really be another dud elmo? yup. we finally read the reviews here and saw that there are all similar problems with the doll. Does not format with windows XP. NO wonder they were so quick to send us a new one. OH by the way, we did get the second one working using someone's laptop. No good if you want to change the settings at a future time. The elmo did awaken in the middle of the night, day etc and mysteriously start talking "play with me Johnny." Needless to say, Elmo is going back to defunct land with all the other defects.	-1
Didn't work. And I have the Pooh one too. Neither of the programs downloaded to the dolls from either of my XP machines (one's a laptop, one desktop). And I have an 98 machine that's too old. I REALLY do not want to return them!! I just want them to WORK!! I don't have ANY $$ now to buy something else like this. These were IT for my 3 and 1 1/2 year olds! I even bought them matching Pooh and Elmo slippers. I thought Fisher Price/Mattel was a GOOD toy company. I guess I was wrong! Didn't they TEST this on XP FIRST?? Where's the software patch for this problem?? I'm WAITING!!!!  :::Dec 8, 2006:::  I just wrote one review last night. I have called FP/Mattel and nothing has changed! They suggested replacing the batteries. I did that. Then I re-downloaded BOTH dolls. The only thing now is that is does say "Hello...(my child's name)", but when you push it again, it says about 2 words and then is cut off with some static and nothing further happens. This happened on BOTH of the Pooh AND Elmo dolls on 2 SEPARATE computers. I have Windows XP that has been updated for SP 2. Maybe it's the service pack 2 or even 1 doing the problems. I can remove it from my desktop computer (the NEW laptop from HP has it all integrated) and see if that works. So, maybe with everyone that it works with has vunerable computers since they never update their computers. My 3 yr old saw the Elmo one, and I had to tell him it's broken. Christmas this year will suck for him when he'll get his Elmo slippers and no Elmo doll that he SAW while I was trying to fix it this morning while on the phone with FP today. I even asked for a supervisor. Apparently, they were all too busy and they flagged my "claim" and escalated it to a supervisor. Or so they say. The toys go back tomorrow. I feel like ripping my hair OUT! FP will be VERY busy the day after Christams for those parents that don't program it until Christmas day or eve after FP is closed. Glad I don't work there! LOL! I looked at my reciept..I was mistaken..I wasted over $86 (shipping and tax) on these things. ARGH!!!  :::Dec 12, 2005:::  Update! It broke. I changed the batteries AGAIN! Nope! I Exchanged it for a new one. After trying with the 2 computers at home, I used my husband's work computer WITHOUT ANY service packs. And you know WHAT?!?!  Hot-diggity-DOG! It WORKED!  The other one I have (Pooh) worked the 1st time I tried it with the non-SP2 XP computer.  A FP/Mattel supervisor DID get back with me. I described to her the events and she said that they are aware of it and will pass my info that I provided onward. She is sending me a voucher (for a future FP/Mattel toy) for my troubles. It pays to be insistant! (Others may have called me a different name, LOL!)	-1
I WAS IN TOYS R US TODAY AND SAW A DISPLAY FOR THESE DOLLS. U CAN PROGRAM THE DISPLAY TO SAMPLE HOW YOUR CHILD'S NAME WOULD SOUND IF U PURCHASED ONE OF THESE DOLLS (ELMO, DORA, OR POOH) MY SON'S NAME IS DOMENIC BUT WINNIE THE POOH SAID DOMENIC FUNNY, DORA DIDN'T SOUND LIKE IT AT ALL!!!! BUT THE ELMO ONE SAYS HIS NAME PERFECT. I WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING THE DISPLAY IN THE STORE FOR YOUR CHILD'S NAME BEFORE PURCHASING ONE OF THESE JUST TO MAKE SURE.	-1
Just received this doll for my daugher for Christmas and thought I would program early so she could play with it right away. Ugh!  Kept telling me download failed, so we tried a different USB cable to see if that was the problem.  It still said download failed.  Pressed the button anyway to see if it would play and he said his little phrase to squeeze his hand.  Well when I squeezed his hand he said Hello and cut off.  Pressed the hand again and he says the same exact phrase as when you press his tummy.  I can't get him to say anything else.  It also has this scratchy sound when he talks.  Well, this doll will need to go back.  No point in even giving it to her because I will have to take it back and she will be waiting several weeks for a new one.	-1

I purchased this toy for my four year old grandson for Christmas 2011.  He loves cars and trucks and I thought this fit the bill.  It is large and it steers and the roof comes off and the tail gate and hood open.  Well, within a week, the spare tire on the tailgate broke off.  It didn't appear to be attached very well for  toy played with by kids.  I don't think I will be buying this brand anymore.	-1
I ordered this as a gift for a baby shower. It was in plastic wrapping which I left on since I knew the new mom wouldn't need it right away. While visiting the new baby, we opened the package and I was horrified to find that some seams were open in the inside of the ring, stuffing poking out.	-1
My son absolutely loves this game and wants to play all the time.  Unfortunately, after you've played 5-10 thousand times, it loses some of its excitement.  I've hidden the game and pray that I die before he finds it.	-1
Just play the game & enjoy it, & never mind the unimportant money lessons!	-1
I thought this would be like the Pay Day game I played as a kid in the 80s. However, instead of paying rent, utilities, etc., it appears all the activity centers around sweepstakes, lotteries, casino night, and jackpots. I don't really want to embed the idea of gambling in my kids, not that I'm a prude, but there are way too many people in our area who are addicted to it, and it is obviously not a reliable source of income, budgeting, or financial management, as I had hoped this game would teach. I don't think it's even the same manufacturer, the graphics are different, it is definitely NOT the "classic edition." I dislike it so much, I'm not even giving it to Goodwill, instead threw it in the trash. Seems moronic, given the financial crisis of 2008 that we don't produce a game that's fun and intelligent about finances. And while there's a weekly gambling event, the board only allows for buying groceries once a month--guess that shows the manufacturer's priorities.	-1
Worked great but when I needed it for Halloween it was not working highly disappointed.	-1
Don't waste your money.  I bought this and the sound is so horrible, we didn't even use it.  Because we could test it without taking it out of the package (just removing the battery strip) I was hoping I could return in.  But no.  I'm stuck with it.  Total junk.  Very disappointed.	-1
Complete garbage. Worked ONCE. When we first received it. And it sounded like a vacuum cleaner, not that good but we just thought we'd use it for a costume party a few weeks later. Then we took it out the night we dressed up and it didn't work! Tried different batteries and still didn't work. Don't bother!	-1
This sounds NOTHING like Darth Vader.  It sounds like there is a storm or something brewing.  It's laughable how bad it is.  Don't waste your money....	-1
I read some pretty bad reviews, but I let some good ones convince me to buy this for my 6 year old's Halloween costume.  He was very disappointed.  It sounds nothing like Vader.  My son can make the breathing noise better on his own without this sound box.	-1
I asked the company about BPA, phthalates and flame retardant chemicals.  Here is what they said.  Our products are BPA free. We only use approved flame retardant on our play tents. There will be a minimal trace of lead and phthalates however, we put each product thorough safety protocols and testing to insure the safest possible product. Our products are all carefully tested, conforming to or exceeding all current federal safety standards.  Thank you  Alicia Campos  Customer Service  Pacific Play Tents, Inc. | Where imagination is limitless...	-1
Didn't last for more than one day. Disappointed.	-1
Said it was made for childern up to 10, my grandaughter is 21/2 and grandson is 4 1/2 and was tore up in less than 2 hours !!!	-1
Broke after a few weeks, not very durable. A tent I bought for less and that was smaller is still okay and was mistreated a whole lot.	-1
This product has 19 steps to complete before your 1 tiny slurpee comes out (if it does)- this is after you put the machine together!  It isn't difficult, just a time-consumming pain that isn't worth the effort at all. My son always wanted one of these and it was his one gift to open before leaving on a trip for the holidays. After wasting an hour, we ended up with a clogged machine (instructions say to add a 12 oz. soda but warn that this will happen with a soda with two high a sugar content- won't work at all with diet). We tried the concoction that was still in the machine- it was completely flat from processing. You would really have to experiment to find a drink that would work- not worth the effort at all!	-1
Nice tent, but limited to mostly indoor play. Big tent too. My 2 year old grandson is enjoying it.	-1
Anyone else have a problem assembling this? I tried numerous tines. The directions don't work and the plastic poles just kept breaking. Glad my kids got another one from a different company. I gave it two stars cause it looks like the picture.....if only it would assemble.	-1
The tent was very flimsy and easily collapsed.  This product would be great for a four year old and up.  The tunnel was very sturdy and my son loved it.  However it kept collapsing and had to be returned.	-1
Come broken.	-1
Nice case but doesn't fit any of the 1:64 scale it claims to fit.	-1
I bought my Grandson several of the Monster Jam Trucks & this case. NONE of the trucks will fit. They need to make it clear that it is for the older & smaller Monster trucks & NOT for the new Monster Jam Trucks. I agree it is a sturdy case and would work great with the smaller trucks. I gave it 1 star because it does not work for what it was purchased for / or with the Monster Jam Trucks it was purchased with.	-1
I was so excited about these.  The package arrived and smells like mildew.  I think these might be unsafe for the infant due to the odor.  I'm so disappointed.	-1
So I saw these in a catalog and came to amazon to buy because I thought it would be easier. These are quite pricey for what they are but I thought they were so cute. Upon arriving I could see that they were really bad quality. The fabric left lint all over the dolls and there were loose threads everywhere. When i turned one of the doll outfits inside out I could see that the workmanship was really sloppy, it looks like a four year old cut the fabric and sewed it. It says for all ages but I wouldn't give this with all the lint and threads to my young child who still puts things in his mouth. When I tried to return these I was told I'd have to return them at my own cost, which at around $14-$16 is almost not worth it. Usually I buy amazon prime items and am easily able to return at no cost. Since there were no reviews, I just wanted to warn other buyers.	-1
We received this game as a gift, and my 4-year-old daughter was excited to play it (she has the Grumpy Ladybug game, and this is pretty much in that vein).  This game is sheer torture for the parents that have to play it.  There is no educational value in this game (unless your child is learning to recognize numbers 1-6).  The game can get tedious as mentioned in other reviews, so the "saving grace" in most childrens' game, i.e. that they play fast, this one doesn't even have.  There are tons of other games in this age-range that are far, far superior.	-1
I really like the box, the bright colors, and that it seems like a sturdy enough game (unlike some of the really cheaply made games out there). But beyond that, this game isn't even worth the space that it takes up on the game shelf. I have a 2.5 year old and a 6.5 year old. We have played this game maybe three times. Each game seems to go on for what feels like forever. It's just a dull dull game. It's a cute concept, good quality, but just so boring. I think I'll let my 7 year old write her own rules for the game. Maybe she can come up with something a little more exciting. We'll see :)	-1
Mine came ripped. Unfortunately I didn't take it out of the package until one day after the return date. It is very cheaply made and sewn--and made of flammable materials. If you are desperate and buy it, give yourself time to return it--and take it out immediately to inspect for damage.	-1
I wanted to get my 20-month-old some fun but educational bath toys and found that the market is greatly lacking. I decided to order these hoping that they would be solid plastic and not hold water. I won't buy the squirt type toys anymore for my son because they are impossible to keep clean and have to be thrown away after a few months. Needless to say, these are squirt toys even though the description says nothing of it. I was willing to give the toys the benefit of the doubt because I really liked the shape matching features and my son is at the stage where he loves matching shapes, colors, etc. I took them out of the mesh bag, which is great to have for bath toys though they could have included a suction cup for hanging it up, and I realized that the plastic on some of the turtles is extremely flimsy. When my son tries to match the shells to the turtles, the body of the turtles just cave in and he can't get it on. Not all the turtles are this way, but most of them are. I regret wasting my money on these. What a rip off! Avoid at all costs!  If you're looking for a fun, open-ended yet affordable tub toy, try the tub stickers by Alex. There are a bunch of varieties, they are super easy to clean and come with a mesh bag with suction cups to hang up in your bath or shower to drip dry. My toddler LOVES them!	-1
At times it is difficult to get the shells back on because the turtles flatten when you push on them.  I am giving 1 star because the turtles have holes in their mouth to squirt water.  Why this is included I do not know because it just makes the toys mold.  Would have been a 5 star without the holes.  I tried to hot glue over the holes and it peels off in the bath.	-1
I love the concept of these turtle bath toys and my kids loved playing with them.  I did not see anywhere in the discription that they are squirt toys so I did not realize the each have a tiny hole in them so that they can be filled with water.  The description said they were mold resistant but mold did end up inside of them and we had to throw them away.  If they were solid with outa squirt hole I would have rated them much higher.	-1
We bought this volcano in October for our 6 year old grandson who would be visiting from Oregon in December. He was excited when he opened the volcano but what a HUGE disappointment. False advertisement comes to my mind after we tried the volcano. It did not erupt. It simply dribbled liquid over the side & as we all looked, expecting some type of eruption, we shook our heads & wondered why the instructions said to wear goggles & protective clothing. It was a dud! Thinking we had done something wrong, we reloaded the volcano & had the same "dud"experience. Very disappointing to say the least. Our grandson just walked away. We decided to return it to Amazon but, evidently Amazon has a "window" of how long they will accept returns. We did not know this. They say this volcano can not be returned & the dang thing cost $36!!! Being an early shopper for Christmas gifts, I am more than disappointed! There is something wrong with being penalized for shopping early!! Now, what the heck do I do with a volcano nobody wants? DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, It does not do what it says it will do. This whole experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth dealing with Amazon. I have done a ton of ordering with Amazon but won't so much anymore.	-1

Very overpriced!	-1
Not worth the money....sorry.	-1
So, what we like about this puzzle is that it's enormous -- it's the size of a first-grader.  After you put it together twice, all educational value has been gleaned.  There's only 15 pieces, 6 bones are named (Humerus, Femur, Radius, Ulna, Tibia, Fibula).  Some of the long bones have their Latin names (see above) but then you get SPINE (not vertebrae) and HEAD (not cranium) and HAND (Not carpals/metacarpals/phalanges).  No mandible, no patella, no scapula/clavicle, no sternum...	-1
The look very nice but both the grasshopper and the dragonfly had holes in them right out of the box and wouldn't hold air for more than about 5 minutes.  One was a pin hole, the other was on the seam, the material was trimmed too close.  Disappointing for how much they cost.	-1
ice melts in  minutes. there should be an air chamber on bottom to keep ice off the warm water. 10lb bag of ice gone and drinks warm in 45min tops.	-1
We used this for three days over Labor Day weekend. It does not seal well, and the river water causes the ice to melt quickly. We even lined it with foil bubble wrap like you use in a car windshield, and that didn't help. It is stable and never turned over. We will just have to put another cooler inside of it to make it more functional.	-1
Dumb. Gave as a gift. Was disappointed.	-1
The concept is good but trying to carry it it tipped over twice. If it made it to the river it probably would have floated :(	-1
Leaks	-1
Out of the box the sides and bottom of the cooler has multiple holes.  It actually looked like some mechanical device shredded portions of the plastic before it was packaged...probably during assembly, because neither the Intex box the manufacturer packed the cooler in, or the Amazon box it was shipped in was damaged.  That means the plant couldn't have tested the product for leaks before boxing it up.  This one is going back, and since Intex's quality control is obviously absent for this product, I will not be reordering.  This is an nice concept...just wish the QA was better!	-1
The one I received is the same concept and function, but is a solid white with some blue lettering on it, not this cute looking clear plastic with blue and pink lettering, so that was disappointing, and I'm not going to go to the trouble to send back an item like this, so beware, they may not send you exactly the product you think you are ordering!	-1
We are a big game family and have all of the Cranium games.  I love the new ideas they have and am constantly impressed by their uniting of intelligence and fun, however, bumparena is not their best work.  Now, my daughter might be a little on the old side for this game (9), but she still loves Hullabulo and Cariboo, which are aimed at the younger kids.  Bumperena is just not fun over and over.  It also is a pain to set up and doesn't fit back in the box.  The idea is cool, and the pieces are cool looking, but the game is not exciting and it sits on our shelf collecting dust.  You would do better to invest in Cadoo, the Family Fun Cranium or Balloon Lagoon.  These days, my daughter is really into Conga, but if your kids are under 7, I wouldn't recommend it, there is a lot of writing with out assistance.  Bumperena is overrated.	-1
To high.	-1
Waste of money.	-1
The plastic part broke on day 1.	-1
They don't work very well.	-1
blue green orange huh how bout pink totally not as described thanks warehouse	-1
Okay, but I wish you could pick a color. I received a bright pink one, my son won't be super thrilled about bright pink. Didnt even see pink as one of the potential options Id receive.	-1
Tore within 2 uses!  I thought this was the answer the cheap version of these that get tangled easily and only can be used once... but nylon material is not durable... parachute ripped easily.	-1
Sorry but it sucks. A grocery bag and a green Army guy would work x9000 times better.	-1
Nope. You have to have adult strength to throw this parachute HIGH enough in the sky to give it time for the parachute to unfurl and actually look like it should as it lands.  My 5 year old grandson would throw it up and the parachute would still be bunched by the time it landed.  He wasn't at all interested in it after about 50 failed tries of making it float down like a parachute. Don't buy.	-1
The parachute is poorly attached to the strings. I've had to repeatedly repair it from the first time my son used this toy, constantly sewing the ribbons back onto the netting. Disappointing. Frustrating.	-1
Doesn't do much or work well. Got 2 and one broke within an  hour of opening it.	-1
I bought this for my little boy for His Easter basket and received pink. I know it says colors for boys and girls and picked randomly, but it's not even pictured. Just wanted to make everyone else aware.	-1
Got pink.  I know boys can play with pink but it would not be a color I would choose for this.  Literally ANY other color would have been fine.	-1
You have to throw this thing like over 15feet high for it to work. The ceilings in the family room are 12' high, and the parachute opens right before it hits the ground. Waste of $$	-1
As an adult, these are difficult to throw high enough to get them to work.  Would not recommend for a child unless they can throw them off of stairs or from a hieght	-1
Paratrooper ripped off on a few of these.  I bought 3 of them for my kids and 2 ripped within a month of owning.  The man is not very well attached considering you are throwing this up in the air repeatedly.	-1
I want to buy more of these for every kid I know. It's very durable and DOES NOT TANGLE. Fool-proof fun. Floats down beautifully. I can't comment on the glow factor - haven't used them in the dark. But overall I would absolutely recommend this toy!  EDIT: It's been 3 months since my son got this from Santa. I've had to sew it 5 times now - and not just a few stitches...like take out the sewing machine and redo entire seams. The seams rip - even with light, indoor play. I had to edit my review to remark on it's durability...which now is 1 star. Great concept. Poor construction. :( :(	-1
Whenever I have bought a book of this kind it ALWAYS included the pages but this one does not have any pages, it is only a binder with a picture of a football on the cover.  What a total rip-off for ten bucks!!  I was very surprised that not one person who reviewed this item included this information and that the seller did not include this info either.  All the description says is, "You can add as many pages as you want" - yea add them, or fill the book with them is a better description!	-1
got wrong one	-1
This does not spin nearly as well as the original version, taking a lot of the fun out of it.  Also, it is oval shaped, which doesn't fit little bottoms as well.  It's noise is loud and obnoxious.  Even my son grew tired of the noise.  It's durable, but since it doesn't get much use, that's really not much of a selling point!	-1
My daughter is 3 and barelt fits on the toy I cant imagine how a 5 yr old would sit on it. As with other reviews its very loud with no volume.. My daughter enjoyed the concept , not so much the toy	-1
Luckily, I didn't pay the outrageous price for mine. I was given one free. But I was surprised when I got it home that it was so small and oval, not round. I remembered them being a lot bigger when I was younger. My 3 1/2 year old was able to get it moving, but not very fast and she seemed too big for it. It doesn't work well on carpet. We had to move it to the kitchen linoleum floor for just a bit more speed and even then it was pretty slow. My 19 month old couldn't spin it himself at all and I think it frustrated him. The other thing is the Simon Says game gets annoying after awhile. The kids just want to spin and don't always care about the game playing. I suggest leaving it off. I feel bad for anyone who paid a ridiculous amount of money for such a cheap toy. I hope my review will help others and save them some money.	-1
nothing like the classic.  barely spins even if you give it a spin with no one on it.  I thought we were upgrading from an old classic one we got second hand.  it's not the same. Save your money not worth it and it is soooo loud.	-1
I would love to rate this product higher, but I was expecting something more reminiscent of my own childhood. Didn't they used to be bigger? and round?  Luckily for me I purchased this way too early for DS because he will outgrow it by the time he is "old enough" for it.  He can get it to spin a half a turn at t a time so far, but even as a little guy he hardly fits on the thing.  He loves the music and really likes to dance to it.  We are definitely goin to keep it around, perhaps not as long as we'd hoped, but nothing is perfect for everyone.	-1
We got this toy awhile ago and my daughter has yet to spin on it.  The only thing she's managed to do is step on it, fall, and practically crack her head open.  I don't get it.... if she sits on it, it hardly spins at all.  But when she stands on it, it spins too much and she almost kills herself.  Plus the noise this thing emits is highly irritating.  This is not how I remember the Sit N Spin from my childhood.	-1
Soooo dissappointed! Waste of space and money. I thought my daughter would enjoy this(as I did as a kid) but it is really hard for her to spin on it(she's 4 and a pretty strong kid).It's also very LOUD!The music is the only thing my kid likes about it. Why did the toy maker change the sit and spin?My cousins and I used to fight over it and we would all pile on top of it and spin,it was a blast. Now my daughter and her 2 cousins barely acknowledge it! What a shame...	-1
I gave this gift to my 3 year old nephew for Christmas and I am SO dissapointed!!  My nephew is definitely a "boy's boy" and is really physical and strong.  He had the worst time spinning this thing and it never would go fast enough around where he would enjoy it.  He actually enjoyed the music but the base is shaped like an oval so when he would try to "spin the other way" how Simon would tell him to the sit and spin would get all off balance and actually tipped over a few times.  I remember loving my sit and spin when I was a kid.  This is nothing like the product that we grew up with, save your money.	-1
A really large, battery guzzling music box. Certainly all it's good for. It sits allright! And sits... and sits... no spinning yet to be found and my 23 month old son has poked and prodded it from top to bottom. Too stiff... almost like they went stupid crazy overboard on safety precautions? It'd take a couple of semi trucks and a good sturdy wench to get any action outta this thing. Catchy tunes, though.	-1
I bought this Simon Says version because of the reviews the original Sit N Spin got.  I wish I got the original Sit N Spin.  This one is oval shape which makes it harder for the kids to spin on it.  No matter how much I tell my daughter and her friends to sit on the star, which is the longer part of the oval, they always sit on the shorter end of the oval and they fall off.  We'll that's not fun.  She doesn't play the Simon Says game and is not interested in it.  Quite frankly, it is too hard to all of a sudden "spin faster" or to "spin the other way."  It does have a on/off switch.  Also,it maybe my imagination, but it seems to me that you can't spin as fast on this Simon Says version.  It doesn't seem as smooth moving.  Purchasers of the other Sit N Spin with the lights don't like the noise it makes and because it doesn't have an on/off switch, but the fact is, the kids love that one.  My daughter used it at her preschool.  Buy the other Sit N Spin with the lights and music and just let your kid use it outside if it bugs you.	-1
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter b/c my hubby and I both remember how much we loved having one when we were growning up.  This new version is just not the same!  The base is barely big enough for her to sit on (and she's VERY petite) and it does not spin as "freely" as the old ones did (probably b/c of all the electronics).  The "talking" is pointless...she just wants to try to spin on it, not follow the "Simon Says" directions.  I give it 2 stars b/c she LOVES to use it as a stool to sit up to our coffee table and color or use her play laptop.	-1
My kids never seemed interested in actually sitting and spinning on this thing.  All they wanted to do is activate it and listen to the music - over and over again.  I couldn't wait to throw this thing away.	-1
Very surprised with the excellent reviews for this building toy.  My son loves to use his imagination to build any type of item.  I bought this toy for him as I thought it would be a step up from legos.  Was I so wrong!  The pieces do not fit well together and fall off very easily.  The worst part about the building toy is the flexible ends easily break off.  Not a well made product.	-1
Not much to it.  Boring.	-1
