This rates up there with my Sega GT review for worst game ever. Worst graphics I have ever seen for a playstation game and the system is in its 6th year now. All I want to ask Capcom is why release this trash to the public. I'm the biggest Resident Evil saga fan ever. I bought this game with high hopes and was let down by the biggest video game company in the business. I played it for about an hour couldn't take it anymore and threw the game out of the window. Capcom why I ask why?	-1
I LOVE the Resident Evil series. But this game, ow my, it's the worst game I have ever, ever played. I was thinking to burn the CD, but the fire could be really disappointed burning one bad CD. I know you won't find this helpful, but, on my opinion, DON'T LOOSE MONEY!	-1
Ok let me tell you this. RENT DONT EVEN DARE BUY! The only thing that kicks on this game is first person view mode. But this game is not even fun. You work for umbrella in some crazy city a little after resident evil 3 and you fall from a helicopter and get amnesia not knowing you are the most feared person in the world. You screw around killing zombies but you never ever ever get to have any fun at all. Whats with capcom now? Why are they so lazy now when it comes that they make even greater games than konami does. Now one game i reccomend is Resident Evil Code Veronica, its very fun.	-1
THIS GAME DOES USE A LIGHTGUN UNLIKE AMAZON RECKON first off the graphics are pretty nice, the best of the type on the playstation and the zombies look, move and die better than in the other light gun games on the console. to say that the graphics are poor is wrong, you'd have to miss all of the nuances of them, like the flesh dripping off the zombies or all of the other resie touches in the game the gameplay is a pretty standard affair for lightgun games during combat but bnothing short of revolutionary when moving. you point at the screen and click the trigger to kill the enemies, normal, but to move instead of using a controller you point off the screen in the direction you want tom move and hold the trigger. great and really adds to the atmosphere as unlike the other resies you can only see whats infront of you. there is a problem though with this method as the AI in the gamne is not exactly top notch and this means that the hardest enemies in the game, the bosses can be beaten with relative ease. well, nope... there is a bit of replay value in there though with the premise of different endings and to pick up all of the documents within the game and so see the whole story. much like almost every  other resie game / survival horror game on the market...	1
Actually if it weren't for the zombies i proabably wouldnt know that it was a Resident Evil game. This game gives RE a bad name! First of all its short! Short as in an hour and a half of gameplay for you first time playing it! Next is it has an awful story line! You a dude who lost his memory and thinks hes vincient (who is bad) and latter recovers his memory. Bosses..... im not sure if there are any,you run into Mr. X a few times but thats all besides the final tyrant......very easy! I just stood there while he ran in circles around me and jumbed over me and shot at him. Graphics.......hmmmm not good not good! Another thing is if your gonna play it and have a short ammout of time and think you can just play it,get a little ways in and save your wrong! No saves,nope none. Have i already said this game is easy? First time playing my ranking was an A. What about ammo,will you ever run out? Not in this game because you have unlimited ammo with the hand gun! Pluse you find ammo like crazy for the other guns! If you like playing bad games or are a huge resident evil fan get this game! If not forget it and play dino crisis2 or resident evil code:veronica!	-1
It takes a 3rd person perspective similar to Tomb Raider with the camera always following behind you and over your head.  The controls start off as complicated for the average PS2 player, but a person used to computer games shouldn't find it too strange with the left analog mapping to the arrow keys and right analog mapping to the mouse for the average computer 1st person shooter. The combat system is simple with your standard punching and kicking techniques.  You'll gain new moves as the game progresses but beyond the basic combos they tend to be difficult to pull off in real combat situations and not worth the effort.  The game does an excellent job representing the realism of guns.  Fighting two or more armed opponents when you are not armed will inevitably result in death.  The computer AI is even smart enough to know that if there's a gun on the ground it's to its advantage to go and pick it up rather than continue fighting hand to hand.  Unfortunately, the computer AI has no problem doing suicide attacks with rocket launchers inside of rooms taking away from games realism and making certain fights frustrating. The levels, while being well designed and sometimes vast, have no eye candy in them.  Backgrounds are plain and unexciting.  The people move fluidly enough when fighting but no special attention was given to rendering when they are talking with each other during story scenes. The game also shows some pretty amateur problems.  You'll see enemy's arms sticking through walls and you sometimes are even able to hurt the enemies through the wall.  Turning properly when close to a wall will often let you see on the other side of it. The story line is entertaining in the anime cyberpunk motif with some very well done voice acting.  I was drawn into it at certain points being angry at characters and wanting to seek revenge.  There's even a split point in the story line that will affect the final ending of the game. Unfortunately, Rockstar took out the multiplayer combat mode of the game in order to get it out on time.  This reduces the replay value immensely and there's little incentive to play again after you've beaten both endings to the game. Overall, it's a fun game to play through and enjoy.  It's worth the money if you enjoy the 3rd person beat-up style game.  It won't win any awards for pushing the hardware that it's on.	1
The Tomb Raider series is great, but by TR3 was beginning to get repetitive.  Oni is essentially a darker, faster, more challenging, futuristic Tomb Raider game for those who have outgrown the Tomb Raider series. This was my first time playing this type of game on a game console (I had previously played the Tomb Raider series only on Macs).  While using a controller and not a standard keyboard was a little odd, the controls were easy to learn, aided greatly by the interactive training stage before the main adventure begins.  Oni also includes actual hand-to-hand combat, which is often a much better option than using the various weapons.  The enemies are also far smarter than in the Tomb Raider series.  And the multiple levels of play provide increasing challenges for expert players. The action is fast-paced and thought-provoking, the storyline intriguing, and the music excellent.  This is certainly not a Gran Turismo 3 or an SSX, but Oni is still a wonderful game with good replay value.	1
I really like this one.  The controls are a bit complicated, but I think that's one sign of a complex game that takes a while to master.  Once you got the controls, uh, under control the game takes off and is REALLY a blast! Big levels.  Really smooth graphics and interaction.  Good sound.  Not too cheesy, etc etc etc.  A really balanced and good game. The graphics aren't the best the PS2 has to offer, but they're suited to the type of game Oni is.  I've never been one to be balk at a game just because graphics aren't cutting edge...there's way more to this game than it's cover appearance. Buy Oni and get into it.  For the price it's now going for, it'll be well worth it.	1
Despite all the reviews I read on this game, I rather enjoyed it. I did however beat the whole thing in less than 24 hours, owing not to my gaming prowess, but rather to the lack of having a life. Ha ha ha. Anyways, I thought the 3-D environments were interesting, and easier to navigate due to their sparse nature. They gave the game the not so distant future feel. What was difficult was when you actually fought. The controls are a bit aggrivating, and the enemies skill at exploiting that fact get better with each level. You can forget about using weapons at long ranges until you get either the rail-gun like weapon, or the screaming cannon thingy. The screaming cannon is one of the more creative innovations in weapons I have seen in games. Basically you shoot it at your target, and it stalks the poor person as it drains them of life. Some victims actually whimper, and say things like I don't want to die.   And for all you saddists out there, there are "innocent" civilians you can beat up and kill. They whimper, and beg for their lives too! Just make sure you don't start abusing them until they give you something, like hypo's, or ammo clips.   Lastly there are codes available for this game. Some make you tiny, huge, help you to change your character, make your head enormous, or make you invisible. They enhance replayability....  Another down side is that they removed the multi player feature before release. Too bad, it might have been fun. Overall, I think the game deserves 4 stars for entertaining me, and making me laugh out loud at a few points. So rent it first to see if you like it.	1
The graphics could be better. But they are not that bad. It has a certain feel to the game that draws you into the story and the events.  The controls are a little odd, but with a little practice you can get the hang of them. Although in high stress situations I have the odd moment of poor control.  Some of the missions are a little hard and you do have to use all your characters moves and skills to survive. I have been waiting for this game for a while and I have not been disappointed. It's fast, fun and for the most part logical with it's level flow.   I think it deserves a solid 4 stars. It is alot of fun and one that I am happy to have.	1
For any of you that have already played siphon filter for the PS1 then I will suggest you go back and play it instead of reading my review of this game.  As many of you have already guessed Oni has the same general game play and feel as the aforementioned game.  Additional control was added to give the player more things to worry about during game play but otherwise not much has changed mechanically.  Now as for the storyline this game presents a classic, or should I say transparent, plot that does not develop into anything worthwhile.  Each level is more of the same thing with the foreshadowing functioning as subtly as a herd of elephants.  In short this game could only be redeemable if it had come out on the PS1.  There is no evidence of the capability, or the price tag, that has become associated with PS2 titles. I would recommend renting this game instead of purchasing it.  There is little to no replay value and the plot will not keep a player interested for long.	-1
Well what can I say.  This game doesnt really suck, but isn't that good.  The idea of a first person view was a good idea but this game lacked in several areas.  The plot wasn't very good at all.  It seemed as if the game was just thrown together to just put something on the market.  I'm a huge fan of the resident evil series, but this game was a real dissapointment.  My advice is to definatly rent the game first (it isn't very hard.  I beat it in one day).  If your a fan of the series then its definatly worth playing, but i wouldnt pay for it.	-1
Let me start off by stating that I got this game with the strategy guide, and I have yet to see what any of the pages look like.  This game is painfully easy and un-advanced. In Japan, the gamers were able to play this much more like "House of the Dead" games, rather than in the US where it seems that Capcom wants to cash in on the American lust for first-person shooters.  The light gun is just something you CAN get for the PSX, but it isn't what you might call "Standard Issue" for the conventional hard-core gamer.  A light gun additive being required or at least allowed (I'm not sure if it is, a gun costs sometimes ..., and I have a few freinds who had problems playing this with it) would have made this SO MUCH BETTER!  Also, give us rapid fire for the guns! Also, while I have seen much worse, the graphics can use a serious polishing.  Also, the animation is distorted by the fully 3-D world, and the first person view destroys all fear techniques used so well before. The sound is terrible.  To start off, there is really no decent music like in RE's 2&3, the music in here is really both bland and pathetic.  Also, the voice acting is pretty bad, but I'm sure that it would sound a whole lot better if it didn't sound like you were listening to them underwater. However, while the sound it awful, it's nowhere near as completely worthless as much as the sound in the first RE title(mainly the beyond dismal music and voice acting). Now, the story, well, actually, it's not so bad.  It does have a really good setup and a few good plot twists, and also the main character was told to investigate by his freind Leon S Kennedy (the hero of RE2 who could with one finger kick Chris Redfeild's ...!)!  Also, the area's that are only accessible through replay have some excellent files that rival the best of RE's 2&3.  However, the decent (although terribly short) storyline is destroyed by all lack of realism in the gameplay.  I mean face it; you fight a Tyrant only 20 minutes into the game, the puzzles solve themselves, enemies can't hit you when they are directly behind you, and even if they could, you have SO MUCH health, and you generally start off in the same basic location when you start with your next "life". All in all, this game is far from worthless, but even further from being able to hold onto the "Resident Evil" title it holds.  I liked the first one, I was blown away by the second, the third one rocked my world, and now...this.  I'm now just waiting for Code Veronica for the PS2, while playing something else.	-1
This is my first play station 2 game, I have been waiting to get this game ever since I herd about it, that has been a while now. Since I have been waiting for this game I held great  expectations for this; I was disipointed. The first thing I noticed about this game was how complicated the controlls were, and the people who made the game took the time for u to get used to the controll, that was good but the falts start coming out when you start playing threw the levels, what I mean is when the enemies fall they sometimes seep threw the walls, doors, or anything they fall onto, it is really quite appaling since the power of the playstation 2 can do so much to fix that. the other thing I  did not like is the characters in the cut scenes look like they have no life to them. But the game has so much to offer, like the really challinging enemy AI, the enemies are actually not stupid.	1
When I started playing the game, I easily got used to the great controls. As I began playing the levels, I realized that this game is complex and fun. Each level is complicated and challenging while incorporating action and fun. Many games have produced beautiful graphics while still being pitiful, boring games themselves. X-squad, Timesplitter, NBA Live, Rc Revenge and many others for the Ps2 have supplied nice graphics with bad gaming. This game is far from that dreadful list.  I recently played Rayman 2: Revolution and felt highly about it. This game surpasses its gameplay on many levels. Firstly, I beleive that the topic is just generally more fun. The cross breed of fighting and first-person shooter really works nicely. You beat up and shoot down your enemies in vivid, task-related levels. Graphically this game is only above-average. The game holds its own visually but no stunning awe like in SSX or Madden 2001 is present. Knowing and excepting this is nothing of a task. I barely noticed anything bad when playing this. Some may find the backgrounds a tad pail, but they don't like games, they like special effects and the replays of any game. If you want a fun game with action buy this.(You must note though, that the graphics are similar to a good dreamcast game. If you want graphics, buy Rayman 2:Revolution.)	1
I picked up Samba not thinking I'd enjoy it but boy was I wrong. Samba had me hooked instantly and the following day I went out bought the maracas. I must say the game is great with just the controller but it's totally fun with the maracas. During a recent family party, I put the game on and had everyone doing the maracas in no time! People who never really played games before were having a blast! Part of the fun of the game is trying to win new music by beating the "Challenge" mode which can be quite difficult. But it's worth it when you unlock new tunes to shake your maracas too! Even young gamers can have fun playing "Whack a mole" with the maracas. This game is pure genius. Also, you can download tunes off of the Samba web site via your Dreamcast. Finally, a game for the masses and one that will turn you into a dancing fool!	1
I cannot stop laughing, this game is so much fun.  All my friends are rolling on the floor laughing at themselves, but they keep playing because it is so much fun (and they are a tough crowd).  Samba de Amigo is the *perfect* party game, because absolutely everyone comes over to see what is going on, and even the stiffest square will eventually give it a go.  I can actually get my grandmother to play. Samba de Amigo is a music game, in which you shake maracas to the beat of the music.  You shake 'em high, you shake 'em low, you shake 'em fast, you shake 'em slow :)  You strike funny poses at times, and the rythmns gets harder, but the fun never goes away.  It's one of those simple things that makes you think "Why did anyone think of this before?" ps - you absolutely must buy the maraca controllers to play this game if you want to enjoy it.  Get 2 sets - after one party, you'll feel that you got your money's worth.	1
I've wanted this game ever since I read a et's play found on the let's play archive. The really cheesy voice acting might turn off a lot of people, but this is a solid RPG.	1
Considering the huge debt that the fantasy genre owes to Norse mythology, one would think there would be more projects paying homage to this inspiring source.  Though VALKYRIE PROFILE (VP) may have been alone in its Norse roots, we can be thankful for the unique concepts that it brought to the RPG table. In particular . . .  COMBAT The first thing that really drew me into VP was the unique combat system. Turn-based, yes, but mashing the controller buttons and watching all four of your sword-swinging characters rush a single enemy before unleashing up to four separate special attacks--to include swords that wreak explosive destruction--is utterly thrilling to watch! While this style of combat does encourage more button-mashing than most other RPGs, there is still a lot of strategy involved, especially when magic-users are in your ranks. I especially found their "Wait Reaction" attack invaluable for catching enemies off guard before sending my sword-wielders in to take down foes. As with most all RPGs, since there is a lot of combat, it's a good thing they got it right.  GRAPHICS I usually don't mention graphics so early on in a review, but the graphics for this game ARE really good. Not only are there CGI scenes, but there are also cartoons reminiscent of the LUNAR games. Even more impressive is when CGI magic attacks are seamlessly incorporated into the battles you fight. Finally, I was thrilled at the action-figure size of the characters. This made the characters seem larger than life, especially characters like Arngrim who carry an equally massive sword. Even without a big-screen TV, you should have no problem seeing the action on the screen.  MUSIC In an earlier review of mine (which can be found here&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Valkyrie-Profile/dp/B000E1NY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Valkyrie Profile</a>) I remarked on how odd it was for an Oriental composer doing the soundtrack for a game steeped in Norse mythology. A lot could have gone wrong here, and yes, there is a lot of "blah" on the soundtrack, but there are also quite a few masterpieces of video game music to be found. Examples would be the song "Behave Irrationally" or some of the boss battle tunes. Another plus is that all the tracks can be listened to within the game via a special soundroom.  GAMEPLAY As the title of my review states, this game is both daunting and full of depth. It's DAUNTING in that there are 3 endings, but the best of these is practically unattainable without a walkthrough, which is what I resorted to after attempting this game two or three times without one. Honestly, I don't know how the developers expected someone to attain this "A" ending using primarily trial and error. And to be honest, I didn't find the "A" ending all that impressive either, especially when compared to other great RPG endings: The 20-minute ending of FINAL FANTASY 6 or the extended end-game quests of LUNAR 2: ETERNAL BLUE. As for DEPTH, this game has it in spades. There is a huge character pool to select from, even after some of these warriors are sent to Valhalla. Tons of spells, items, weapons, armor, trinkets, artifacts . . . you name it. Not only that, but you can "Transmutate" some of these items into other items or cash them in for "MP" which is the magical "money" that one uses. Characters can learn a huge list of abilities, raise individual stats, or even allocate points to make them a "better" warrior, one more fit for the army of lord Odin. All the dungeons and enemies within are pretty unique. However, the towns, unique as they are, serve very little purpose in the grand scheme of things. But perhaps most unique about VP is the concept of your main character, Valkyrie, harvesting worthy souls for Odin to use in Ragnarok, the End of the World. You could argue that you are still being led from town-to-town like most other RPGs, but in my opinion this game leads one character-to-character.  CONS Apart from the brutal difficulty and learning curve of this game, the only other negative things I have to say are rather nitpicky in nature. For one, figuring out which items to create for your characters is often a matter of trial and error. Expect to create lots of things like "chainmail" only to find out that character X can't equip it. Doh! Creation costs offer a slight clue as to what the best equipment is, but this is not always a reliable rule to follow.  OVERALL Although I think this is a good game with a few flaws, if nothing else VALKYRIE PROFILE should be praised for drawing from Norse Mythology and doing a great job of capturing its essence. I've found that this game is one of those that you may struggle to get involved with, but no matter how many times you put it off to the side, it always seems to call back to you, begging to be played.	1
Is she not perfection... this game was amazing. GREAT STORY, good game play, interesting combo attack system. Maybe the most enjoyable game I have ever played. Several endings based on how and when you do events. Very expensive now but if your up to spending for these overpriced playstation games this is the one to get.	1
This one is worth it, though! I was lucky; I got mine for twenty bucks from a Walmart a few years back. An interesting and unique title which I still put in and play today, Valkyrie Profile will disappoint you if you can get a hold of it. Personally, I wouldn't let my COMPLETE, MINT game go for less than two hundred, though (that is to say, you ain't gettin' it!). Valkyrie Profile follows the last days before ragnarok, the end of the world. You play as Lenneth, one of three valkyries who must gather the souls of the powerful slain to fight for the Aesir in their final struggle against the Vanir (yeah, I know, they were SUPPOSED to fight the giants, but give 'em a break). Along the way, however, you may uncover clues to your own clouded existence (the choices are up to you), and in any case, you will meet many reprehensible characters who will fight by your side. The games development system mirrors that of Star Ocean 2 (another fine game from the same makers), and the combat is incredible. Unbelievably enough, an RPG finally understood that yes, combat and levelling up COULD be interesting. In fact, no part of this game is boring. Strategic combat, good storyline (the intro is a little lengthy, however), multiple endings, choice-driven role-playing - what more could anyone ask? But apparently, many people DID want more. This game bombed over here (unfortunate, since obviously the makers had sequel in mind, judging from the endings), but you would be very lucky to play this now. So let me say: Should this game ever find its way into your local used game store, snap it up! You'll be quite happy you did.	1
An epic RPG set in a world of mass depression and nearly no hope.  This has to be one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time.  It's by the makers of Star Ocean 2, which is an incredible game.  Even to todays standards, Valkyrie Profile will not disapoint.  Now go buy it.  You owe it to yourself.	1
Maybe it's my Norse blood, but I've always thought Valkyries were supercool. And an RPG with a female hero makes me jump for joy. The premise is completely original and compelling; as a Valkyrie, you must collect recently dead souls for the war of the gods. Many of the character's back stories are moving, and they are all sad since they all die early. (I found the mermaid Yumei's story especially compelling.) There's a lot of voice acting, but most of it is good (except in the intro) and some of it is oustanding. The graphics are very nice too. But the truly great thing about Valkyrie Profile is the gameplay. There are no random battles; all the monsters are on the screen for you to see. Treasure drops aren't random, either. If you can get your four battling characters (Lenneth Valkyrie and three others) to "juggle" an enemy, you have a very good chance of getting a treasure. Unlike most RPGs, you actually have something to do during battle; the timing of button pressing is extremely important, and it never gets repetitive or dull. And outside of battle, there's a lot of Megaman-type jumping and puzzles going on. There are three modes: Easy, Regular and Hard. There's no real reason to play "Easy" unless you need to familiarize yourself with the game, but with multiple endings and different dungeons in Regular and Hard modes, there's every reason to return. There are many more wonderfully original and perfectly executed things about this game, but I can't describe them here. I just hope there's a sequel to this often-overlooked, outstanding game.	1
It is no surprising to see such innovative battle system from this title.  After all, it is from tri-Ace.  Being a faithful to tri-Ace, I wasn't disappointed to see this. What surprised me, is that they combined Norse mythology into RPG to create something unique.  There are no hero to save world.  There are no love story (not conventional one anyway) to deal with.  You are just a middlemen to fulfill your duty as a battle-maid.  With all conventional ideas thrown out, it still gives sense of comfort for RPGers to easily pickup and play this beautiful game.  With hand drawn scenery to enchanting score, this is amazing title. I just love it!	1
Valkyrie Profile is the latest game from Tri-Ace, the creators of the absorbing Star Ocean series. Its two-dimensional, platform-game feel brings back memories for those of us who played games like Mega Man back in the day, while combining it with RPG battles and plotlines. The combination works much better than I had expected. The game shines in graphics and gameplay. Beautiful hand-drawn art brings the harsh world of Valkyrie Profile to life, and the aforementioned platform feel gives gamers a jolt of nostalgia. Battle difficulty follows that gaming cliche: easy to learn, difficult to master. The storyline is very simple on the surface: Lenneth Valkyrie must collect the souls of the dead to battle for the gods at Ragnarok. The game consists of alternating segments of gameplay (dungeons, towns, and such) and storyline (an earthly hero dies and is recruited by Lenneth). While it sounds tedious, both parts are well-integrated into the whole and enhanced by the addition of a countdown until Ragnarok. Dungeon and story segments use up this time, and when the countdown finally ends, the end of the game appears - Ragnarok. While not horribly accurate with regards to Norse mythology, it hits the mark often enough that people with in-depth knowledge of the myths will be pleasantly surprised by a reference to an esoteric character. The story is also helped by a clear and well-written English translation - and while it can be sometimes off-putting to hear the Pokemon voice actors lending their talents to the game, the voice acting is also good, if a bit uneven. This was without a doubt one of the best games of 2000, and quite possibly one of the best games of the PlayStation's lifespan. Highly recommended.	1
To sum it all up it ain't that bad of a game.  It just needed a little extra tender loving care from Enix to make it the caliber of the top-notch SquareSoft games.  The good points: innovative idea.  You're a goddess and go around recruiting warriors, called "Einherjar," to fight the holy Norse wars.  The music is fairly good as well, although it could have been been better.  The bad points.  The game, unlike what the box says, is not 50+ hours.  It is 30 tops, I got through it in 25 getting the best ending in the process.  The ending sequence, the best one, is extremely short.  I'm talking like 3 minutes short followed by 5-7 minutes of credits.  That's only 10 minutes.  Not worth sitting and playing the game through.  What happened to the 30 minute endings of the Super Nintendo age (Final Fantasy 6)?  The kind that made you proud that you neglected your family, girlfriend, and hygiene.  Ah, well.  The story portions can become very boring and you'll find yourself mashing buttons to get past the story and onto the more fun stuff, like bashing in some vampire's head.  The game is a rental at best, lock yourself in your room and play for the weekend, you should beat it.  The only reason anyone should own this game is either a: you love Norse mythology or b: you must own every RPG the Playstation releases or c: it's one of Amazon's ...specials.	1
This is the most original game that has come out since...since...uhhh...Chrono Trigger?  The battle system is great. I like the combo deal, and the graphics are nice. They include paralaxxing, side scrolling, and NICE pre-rendered backgrounds. The sprite-based character models are animated very nicely, and they have loads of detail.  The music is very nice! (It is one of my favorite features).  I like the whole idea of training warriors, then sending them up...very fascinating. I am also a fan of Norse mythology, so its all the more better. Nice story and nice character development, i mean, GREAT character development. Dungeons are very fun. I know this review didn't make much sense, but oh well.	1
WWF No Mercy is sure to be a best selling game of the year for Nintendo 64.  Now, I have owned an N64 for 2 years.  I've seen lots of stupid games.  But this is going to be different.  With new features such as Ladder Match, Table Match(it's still unknown if this mode will be in it or not), Special Guest Referee, and backstage fighting, this is going to be THE BEST wrestling game to date for the N64.  It was confirmed that create a belt mode will not be in No Mercy.  It will have updated rosters, better story lines in the season, and the new SmackDown Mall, where you earn money to buy extras for the wrestlers.  This is the 4th game I've seen since I've had a nintendo that truly deserves a 5 star rating(aside from GoldenEye, Tony Hawk and WrestleMania 2000).	1
Nostalgia overload! Amazing.	1
Great game!	1
Starts up with no problems	1

One of my favorite games of all time. Came in perfect shape! loving it :)	1
Recommended buyer. The game works as described.  Thank you.	1
Thanks, it was perfect. Game was in great condition. Can't Thank you enough. Thanks for being honest.	1
WWF No Mercy was the last of a few things.  It was the last WWE wrestling game released for Nintendo 64, it was the last game developed between THQ & AKI, and it was the last game from wrestling's "Attitude Era" heyday (or as casual wrestling fans put it, "when wrestling was good".)  Unlike the games leading up to this (which were revolutionary in their own right), this one had features and depth that were beyond comparison of it's sister titles (which were&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WCW-Vs-NWO-World-Tour/dp/B000050FB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WCW Vs. NWO World Tour</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WCW-NWO-Revenge/dp/B00000DMB9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WCW/NWO Revenge</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WWF-Wrestlemania-2000/dp/B00001X5C3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WWF Wrestlemania 2000</a>.)  With innovation came some growing pains, however, as the game pushed the Nintendo 64 to the depths of it's technical limitations.  For those who've never played the previous games here's how it works:  Your basic controls allow you to strike, grapple, block strikes, dodge grapples, run, and taunt your opponent.  The longer you hold down the strike or grapple button, the stronger your grapple will be.  You have to use wrestling psychology to win - you have to wear your opponent down using weak strikes/grapples before moving up to strong strikes/grapples or they'll likely be reversed by your opponent.  Once your spirit meter fills up, you can execute a special move by initiating a strong grapple and moving the toggle switch; you can pin your opponent with the L button to score the win.  First the good:  The game itself has a massive amount of replay value due to the match options, career mode, characters available, and the proper attention to detail that's included.  While previous versions of the game focused on singles matches, tag matches, and battle royales,  this one includes the standard singles and tag matches, along with both individual and team battle royales (meaning you can have up to 4 teams facing off against each other), steel cage matches, ladder matches, hardcore matches, and iron man contests.  As mentioned, the roster is stacked.  You can play as any of your Attitude Era favorites, including Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, The Undertaker, and many more.  Wanna play as some of the more popular mid-carders in that day who went on to become main eventers?  Well Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, and Eddy Guerrero are there, too.  The junior heavyweights are well represented with Dean Malenko, Taka Michinoku, Essa Rios, and X-Pac while the hardcore division is represented with the Hollys, Bossman, Al Snow, Visera, and the British Bulldog.  Wanna face off as a diva?  Well you can select Lita, Trish Stratus, Ivory, and Stephanie McMahon (amongst others.)  This roster also probably lists the last time that the WWE heavily invested in their tag division.  In fact, here's a list of the different tag teams you can put together based on who's in the game: -  The Dudley Boyz -  The Hardy Boys -  Edge and Christian -  DX (Triple H and X-Pac or the unlockable Shawn Michaels) -  New Age Outlaws -  The Radicalz -  APA -  The Brothers of Destruction -  The Rock N Sock Connection -  Right To Censor -  Too Cool -  Hardcore and Crash Holly -  Head Cheese -  T&A -  Kaientai -  The Corporation -  N.O.D. -  P.M.S. -  Debra and Tori (I'm hard-pressed to name 10 tag teams in the WWE today, let alone close to twice that.)  So with an astounding roster to your disposal, you can use them in an Exhibition Mode or battle through either Season Mode or Survival Mode.  While Exhibition Mode allows you to simply have a match,  Season Mode gives you the opportunity to win (and defend) each of the following: -  WWF Championship -  Intercontinental Championship -  European Championship -  Tag Team Championship -  Hardcore Championship -  Light Heavyweight Championship -  Women's Championship. The story lines in the Season Mode are extraordinarily deep.  Though it only takes one play-through to unlock the belt you're contending for, the storylines take twists and turns depending on whether you win or lose (and a new story is made available once its your time to defend the belt.)  If you want to reach 100% completion in the storyline modes, there are times where you have to lose (which mirrors actual wrestling, where performers will be asked to "job" to other talent.)  Winning the different story modes will unlock items as well.  If you'd rather beat people up and get paid for it, playing Survival Mode will pit you against 99 different superstars (which will allow you to unlock the hidden ones you defeat, or earn money to purchase them from the Smackdown Mall.)  If customization is important to a player, they'll have both the option to create wrestlers or even their own Pay-Per-View special.  Seeing as how certain wrestlers who didn't appear in this game had their likenesses carried over from Wrestlemania 2000 or the Japanese release of the game (Virtual Pro Wrestling 2), it's possible to create some of the All Japan Pro Wrestling stars at the time (such as Stan Hansen or Kenta Kobashi) in addition to the opening-match wrestlers who weren't included in the game (such as the Mean Street Posse, The Headbangers, Mideon, and Gangrel.)  Certain superstars (mainly the main eventers) get an extended victory sequence or even custom belts (if you beat the WWE Championship season mode with Stone Cold Steve Austin, you get the Smoking Skull belt instead of the standard WWE Championship.)  No, you can't modify move sets for pre-loaded players, but most of them are pretty faithful anyway.  Now the bad: -  The game suffers from slowness once four players are involved in a match (whether it be a tag team match or a battle royale.)  This can be resolved by turning off the sound and inserting a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nintendo-64-Expansion-Pak/dp/B00000INR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak</a>, but it's kinda a bummer when you consider the other games didn't have that problem (or at least as prevalently.) -  The early versions of the game had a glitch that would erase game data.  Though later versions resolved this issue, buyers may want to beware of this and consider getting a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nintendo-64-Controller-Pak/dp/B00004S9A7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nintendo 64 Controller Pak</a>&nbsp;to backup their game data. -  The Season Mode also has an over-reliance on handicap tornado tag team battles (meaning the player versus two CPU components at the same time), who'll pretty much no-sell the moves unless you can sneak off somewhere, do some taunts, and hit the opponents with your special move (I could hit each opponent with 10 consecutive attacks each, and they'll just get up like nothing happened.)  Further aggravating this is that the button to switch perspectives doesn't respond as soon as you hit it, so you have to get some distance away if the second opponent comes up on you while you're attacking the first.  Otherwise, the AI again completely overtakes the game (regardless of difficulty.) -  Though not necessarily "bad", there are times where the AI just completely overtakes the game (the CPU can initiate strong grapples with lower spirit which you MAY break out of, but not only will you lose your strong grapples when you have lower spirit, you'll probably have them reversed when you have higher spirit than your opponent as well.)  This happens at any difficulty level.  You'll develop proper timing with gaming experience, but it can throw younger or inexperienced players through a loop.  So does the game have it's issues?  Sure.  But two of them can be remedied by add-ons while the other two can be remedied by playing a match in 30 minutes when it would've otherwise taken you 10 (or playing against friends instead of the CPU.)  It's not exactly the most kid-friendly wrestling game out there (partially due to the challenge, but also due to the language), but teens, young adults, and those who remember when "wrestling was cool" will no doubt get a kick out of it and handle the challenges facing the game.  Recommended for wrestling fans, Nintendo 64 aficionados, and people who want the finest snapshot of WWE's Attitude Era.	1
Too bad they don't make wrestling games like this anymore.	1
GREAT	1
This game allows you to wreak havoc on the Entertainment.	1
Bring a friend over, dust off your old N64 and have yourself a 60minutes ironman match. That part of the game alone gives it 5 stars. Awesome roster too. Stone Cold, Rock, Mankind, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Undertaker and many more.	1
It does not hold today on features and graphics. Game play best there is in wrestling games. Revenge still feels like a better game overall on gameplay tho. Not to mention has more moves in the game too. Just try hon zon man (great sauke)	1
I had to reset the data on the game, which is no big deal, but other then that it is flawless. Booted right up first time, and still one of my favorites.	1
this game is still very fun even 10 years later. although the graphics are not the best, the engine used in this game is still superb. there are a lot of characters to choose from and the smackdown store is awesome.	1
Still THE best wrestling game - ever!  The biggest thing - a physics system where when your opponent grabs your teammate they are not instantly invincible. In this game you can break up holds, throws or anything you want.  There is an in-depth character creator, tons of moves to build the perfect moveset, a referee who you can beat on tons of fun gameplay modes.  Overall this game shines 1 billion times better than any of the games that have been made since. There's no touching this one.	1
WWF No Mercy is the greatest wrestling game ever made.  AKI started their series with WCW World Tour, and perfected the formula with this game.  There's a ton of wrestlers, a decent create a wrestler system and an engine that still has not been beat.  If they released this game again with online support on the Wii I would easily plunk down $100 to play that.  But, as it is, this game is lost in time, but it's the perfect addition to any N64.  I would take this over the Smackdown vs. Raw games any day.  From the goofy game menu songs to the finishing moves, this game is not to be missed!  The Cons: There is some slowdown when you have four people, and the ladder match can be brutal.	1
To start, I bought this game back in 2000 when I still had an N64. A few years later i went for a PS2 and then the n64 went down the road. I got into some of the ps2 wrestlers like Smackdown: HCTP, and SvR:2006. It didn't take long with those games before i was quite hooked.  Fast forward to 2008, I bought an N64 during the summer along with an expansion pack at a used electronics store (I wanted to relive some nostalgia). No Mercy was one of the main games i was searching for, amazon just happened to have a good used copy available.  It arrived less than a week later, I couldn't be more pleased.  While i won't go into a lot of detail about what makes the game a favorite of mine, there are a few simple things that make it stand the test of time.  The gameplay: With just a spirit meter, visual mechanics are kept to a minimum. There is a lot of flexibility in how you can dish out the damage to your opponent with a huge variety of submission moves and body-specific attacks.  In combination with Create a Wrestler, its easy to create a character who specializes in limb damage. You can also make a brawler who uses a lot of ''KO'' striking attacks (something that is long missing from wrestling games of today).   Other things to note are limb damage, fatigue (Spirit Meter will say ''Danger'' or ''Losing It'').  Double team moves are easy to execute, the sound of breaking bones when a wrestler submits is also a nice touch.  Backstage areas are available to roam in almost any match type, and there is a plentiful selection of weapons.  This game is so easy to play, and the story mode is top notch.	1
I've always loved wrestling games and they just keep getting better and better. I've been into them since the SNES days. And when the 64 came out, WWF War Zone became my favourite, then Attitude, but then THQ started bringing out there WCW titles. I hated the WCW, so I never played them for quite a long time. I never had a go at their first release they brought out, but I somehow ended up with a copy of WCW VS NWO Revenge, at first I was focused to find every flaw I could and put it down and never look at it again, but each day I found myself playing git more and more and more and when THQ lost the rights to WCW they picked up the rights to the WWF and released a game that became my new favourite instantly, "WWF Wrestlemania" . But as the N64 was on it's way out, THQ gave one last release and made the best Wrestling game to date. I've played a lot of wrestling games, and a lot have come and gone, and a lot have had lasting value and quality, but none like this game. Next to Wrestlemania Arcade this game is the best.  There is a tonne of Wrestlers who each have 4 slots. What I mean by that is when you select your wrestler; you can select 4 different versions of that wrestler, with a different look of clothing, or hairstyle or something. Some even have a different character all together. You just press one of your buttons to toggle through them all. And a great option is that you can change every single character. You can change their cloths, name, music, everything except there moves. That mean you can completely replace a wrestler who is a default in the game if you want. Or you might just like to Change one of the 4 Rikishi's into Yokozuna, or change one of the slots of Kane and clone Undertaker so that he has the Tombstone as his finisher instead of the "Last Ride". The best thing about it is that you do not need a memory card; every thing is saved onto the cartridge itself!  There are heaps of matches, and you can choose pretty much whatever rules you want. From pin falls, hardcore, iron man, tag, 2 on 1, 3 on 1, cage, rumble, and even a great ladder much that is a lot of fun to play with friends. The best thing is you can now go back stage. You just whip your opponent up the entrance way, and you can fight in the stage area, then you can whip them back stage again and fight down a corridor that has doors that lead to the boiler room, a locker room with a table you can smash your opponent through, a pool room that you can slam your foe through the snooker table, and a car park. Back in the arena you can also send your enemy crashing through the announcers table! And you can pick weapons out of the crowed at any time, and even use the ring steps! There is a lot of Weapons to grab, almost everything from the WCW REVENGE game is back, but not all, but there is also great big beer cans, al snows Head, books, briefcases, fire extinguishers even a big cheese! There heaps to find.  You can battle in a kind of season match that has story lines to follow, but once you have completed that it becomes very boring, that has no lasting value there. There is also a survivor mode. Which is basically an iron man 4-way battle royal. You have to eliminate 99 other wrestlers to win! You can throw them over the rope to eliminate them, pin then, make them submit or TKO them. If you make it all the way through you get Andre The Giant as a hidden character and he becomes selectable, but the more opponents you eliminate, the more points you get to use in the shop. The shop is a place where you buy new things, from weapons, to costumes, even moves!  The create a wrestler is terrific. The moves look great, and there is so many more new moves added to the game then the last titles. Plus there about 20 slots with 4 each in them to choose from.  The controls work very well, and there is not just one special move to every one, all depending on where you are, wether you are grappling, at there feet, on the rope ect... then great moves can be done.  Where there is good, you have to accept the bad as well. If THQ where still making games for the 64 then they would not these flaws and use it to improve the next version, but everyone is done with the 64.  - No "in-ring" intro. Your wrestler comes out to his theme music and titan tron video, but he only poses on the stage area, they don't walk into the ring anymore and do there in ring poses.  -  - Tag team partners only come out together in season mode. They are separate intros in exhibition modes.  -  - It's really annoying in royal rumble modes when somebody is eliminated and you have to wait about 10 seconds for the next wrestler to run down to the ring and get in, they should have shown that in the back ground and let the game resume instead of doing it the way they have. It is also annoying when you have your "spirit" meter flashing to preform your special moves and it has run out by the time the next wrestler has gotten in the ring.  -  - They have taken out the test of strength showdown. In the last few games if both opponents tried to grapple at the same time they would lock into a test of strength and whoever was the better of the two would get the advantage to preform a move to break it up.  -  - The Undertaker's theme music is a song is RAW. Not whatever his theme song was at the time, either American Bad### by Kid Rock or Rollin,Rollin, Rollin by Limp Bizket. Why didn't THQ just give his old dark side theme or something?  -  - There are great double team moves, but there are a few missing, it would have been nice to have the "double choke slam" that Kane and Undertaker used to do. Or the Tennessee Jam that Too Cool did when one would hold there opponent in a back breaker and the other would jump of the top rope and leg drop the guy being held. Or the move the hardy boys do where one kneels down in a doggy position and the other springs off him for the sidekick.  -  - There is too many Mick Foleys; I think having 12 of him in the game is too many, particularly in Rumbles. But you can just edit over him.  Despite those flaws. This is still the best wrestling game there is. You probably would be able to fix some of those flaws in a rom version maybe, but this is the `still played by me' n64 version.  So layeth the smack down, if ya smell what the sock is cookin'. And that's the bottom line or you can suck it.	1
Maybe it is just me, but I feel that WWF No Mercy is the one that most appeals to a limited crowd. From what I see, it's either you enjoy wrestling and love this game, or you hate/couldn't care less about wrestling and you don't. I happen to be in the latter category, and so I feel that there is nothing about this game that I really enjoy. I really don't think there are anything in this game that would appeal to other non-wrestling-fans except for the fact that it is easy to pick up and play. Being a non-wrestling fan, I don't really understand what exactly the crowd meter thingy is for. You could be beating the life out of the opposing wrestler, yet your relation with the crowd is relatively low. I highly doubt that any other non-wrestling-fans would know what it is either.  That is not to say that there is nothing fun about this game. As I said, the game is very easy to pick up and play. After a few rounds of button mashing, you would be able to figure out that A is to grapple and do whatever other attacks you have, and B is to just beat the living crud out of each and every one of your opponents. Yet if you are not familiar with how to end a match, then you'll likely just attack for a while until your opponent gets seriously bloody. Constantly pressing B just to turn your opponent into a bloody mess gets old if you keep on doing it for several minutes. And controlling characters on a semi-3D environment just does not feel natural. Sure, I don't mind the fact that the game keeps you locked onto an opponent at all times, but it is moving around that gets tedious.  WWF No Mercy was probably the most realistic wrestling game back in 2000. There are authentic entrances with authentic entrance music as well as authentic game modes. Yet to be completely honest, I don't really care. The graphics are more gritty and realistic than Asmik Ace and Aki's previous two wrestling games (1998's WCW/nWo Revenge and 1999's WWF Wrestlemania 2000), and the characters models don't look like faces painted on blobs like earler wrestling games. In other words, they actually look like people this time around. However, they still don't look very good. Stephanie McMahon looks like a zombie, or somebody really ugly wearing a lot of makeup. Crowds are no better than previous Asmik Ace/AKI wrestling games. They don't look like cardboard anymore, but they are just really ugly, really pixelated sprites instead. Sound effects are a bit laughable. It's just "BOOM! KAPAM KAPOW!" Yeah. It's not that I have anything against this game, but I just don't find it that good. It still is the best of the Asmik Ace/Aki wrestling games. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I actually watch wrestling. Hey, at least from the critical success, it establishes the Nintendo 64 as the premiere system for wrestling. That is something to be proud of.	-1
This is one of the most realistic Wrestling game on the N64 and No Mercy hits the spot with great visuals and some really nice story mode.  The game is exclusive to the N64 and sticks to it as it is one of the coolest WWE/F games ever.  It features some great wrestlers such as Stone Cold and the Rock...duhh...  Not many wrestling games get me to say wow but this game really does earn its "wow".  It scores big time with awesome and really incredible matches such as Ladder matches and Cage matches.  Now even though this game is similar to WWf's Wrestlemanio 2000 it is far superior then that as it has better visuals and way better body movement and what is great about  WWf No Mercy is that it has the same exact controls as WWf WrestleMania 2000.  So if you were a Wrestlemanio 2000 addict like myself you will probably get and easy feeling on this game especially how it's more of an "Update" of WM 2000 then any other.  The game does earn its rating and I stick by it.  WWF NO MERCY IS ONE OF THE MOST INTENCE WRESTLING GAMES ON THE N64.  Graphicly this game was far more superior then the Smackdown series back on the Playstation.  It had cutting edge body movement and the visuals were just superb.  It really showed what N64 Is made out of and it really is one of a kind.  Gameplay is pretty similar to WrestleManio 2000 and it seems more of an update then anything els.  I can't go into this except say if you knew how to play WM2000 very well then this will be a piece of cake for you.  Sound....pretty normal nothing new.  Similar to WM2000...  The sound is average, the gameplay was obviously use from WM2000 and I don't want people arguient to me over this but some of it is!  Except for the new characters that were added, the controls are excellent just like the WM2000 controls, Cutting Edge Graphics on the N64 and shows what it's made out of earns this game a  4.3 out of 5  It is one of the best N64 Wrestling games..Also recommended  WCW vs NWO  WRESTLMANIA2000  Lates...	1
This game is so cool. There are a number of moves,attires and musics that are not in WM2K. There are a few drawbacks. One of the major drawbacks is that the Championship/Story mode is hard as hell. There are certain stipulations for the matches. In a hardcore match you have to hit your opponent with a weopon 5 times to complete the match. Out of all the hidden characters Linda McMahon is the hardest to get. You have to pass a certain block for the WWF Title to obtain her. Depending on the title, the story mode is based on the WWF Programing up to that point. For instance, I was playing Mr. POGO and I was getting robbed of the title shot by Hayabusa,who was the WWF Champ and Steven Richards, whom I last eliminated in the Royal Rumble to win it. So it was the Rock/Big Slow/Cripple-H fiasco all over again. Hayabusa and Steven Richards formed an aliance against me(go figure).	1
Wreak havoc on the federation!  Jump into the ring with the beiggest, baddest jabronis around and experience brutal WWF action never before seen in a console game!

You can fight in 10 different arena's, or take it back in 10 backstage areas!  This is the most addictive wrestling game ever created, and stands as an all-time classic, a must have for all N64 owners!  If you've played Wrestlemania 2000, WCW/n. W.o. Revenge, or WCW vs. n. W.o. *World Tour*, you will not only love this game, but will put all of them away for a long time!	1
This game has got to be one of the BEST wrestling games on the market for N64. Great improvements from War Zone, Attitude, and Wrestlemania 2000. One of the great things about this game is the championship mode. You can battle for the specific titles like womens, intercontinental, european, hardcore, and the big one the WWF championship. I am currently playing the hardcore... First you have to win the belt by competing in matches. My favorite part is unlocking different superstars like catus jack, mae young, vince, shane and many more. The rocking audio is great except for the video it is a little buggy but that doesn't interfere with gameplay. New matches like latter, and guest referee makes the game awesome. In the smackdown mall you can even buy superstars and even pay per view arenas like armaggedon, buy HBK, or earl hebner. GREAT GAME COMES WITH MY RECOMMENDATION!	1
No Mercy was a great game title for the 64. It played just like Wrestlemania 2000 but it had a longer and more personal career mode along with a lot of extra perks like being able to buy arenas and outfits and even special moves. This game had everything you could think of. Ladder Match, Royal Rumble, Hardcore matches that went everywhere in the back and of course all of the belts, hidden characters to go along with the already established 40(?) Man given roster on the game. The Create a Wrestler mode was phenomenal and this one didn't get old. The problem with No Mercy was that it was released with a defective. The core memory of the game pack was defective and it would erase your data every now and then (just like NBA Live 97 on SNES if you had too many Created Players). A total nuisance. From what I know, there were only a few perfect games where it didn't do that and if you had one, you were very lucky. I think I went through 3 different ones before I finally got a perfect one. Honestly, if you feel that you could deal with having to play each career mode over and over again everytime it erases (to get all of your belts back), then sure go ahead and get this one. If you know that you can't deal with that, then I wouldn't bother, as unfortunate as that is because besides the whole memory problem, No Mercy was a great game. Again, think about the trade off before you buy this one.	1
This is the best wrestling game out there, The controls are great,Create a Wrestler is the BIGGEST on i've seen yet,Ton's of Superstars,I created FAT ... from Austin Powers!!!.Story Mode is the Best because you can Make your own decisions in it. VERY GOOD GAME (but wwf raw for my xbox is way better)	1
WWF WRESTLING HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE GENRE OF GAMES. THIS IS THE ALL-TIME BEST. CREATE A PLAYER MODE, TAG TEAM MATCHES, LADDER MATCHES, GUEST REFEREE MATCHES WHERE YOU CAN INTERFERE AND COUNT THE PIN AT ANY SPEED. THERE IS A SMACKDOWN MALL WHERE YOU BUY MOVES, COSTUMES, WRETLERS AND YOU GET MONEY BY DOING A SURVIVOR MODE OR A CHAMPIONSHIP MODE. IF YOU LIKE WWF YOU'LL LIKE THIS.	1
This game is exactly what I needed to follow up WWF Wrestlemania 2000.  Updated characters, different moves, create a wrestler feature and it even has the Hoe's to go with the Godfather.  Woohoo.  You can also take your opponent backstage and open a can on him... literally.  Many more weapons, features, and different camera angles all make this game buyable.  I know its a year old but you know, a game like this never goes out of style, I cant wait for the next one.	1
Like I said in my title you do not have to watch the WWF to enjoy this great N64 title.  True I was a fan of the WWF when I purchased this, but even though I do not currently watch it that doesn't mean this game sees no action.  Similar in many ways to its predecessor "Wrestlmania 2000", "No Mercy" attempts to turn it up a notch.  This time around many new features are included such as ladder matches, backstage fighting and more destructible object than ever.  The roster selection is huge allowing a different type of wrestler for every different type player, and if that doesn't satisfy your needs you can head over to the well done create a wrestler mode and make your own.  Career mode allows you to start a campaign for a title belt, which includes a different storyline for every belt.  Multiplayer modes could not be better as up to 4 of you and your friends battle it out in multiplayer matches like royal rumble and tag team.  This game is worth every penny and should not be overlooked by any wrestling fan or video game fan.	1
this is the best wrestling game on the N64 period. even though the N64 usually doesnt always get the best games, it always has the best wrestling games. No Mercy is where Wrestlemania 2000 left off. Except here we get some new features. Back stage arenas, ladder matches, guest referees, and a whole bunch of wrestlers. Sure you may never use Crash Holly or Stephanie McMahon in a match but still its nice to know you have a wide choice of wrestlers. The ladder match is so fun. You can get in the ring and beat down you friends with a huge ladder. my friends and I play this match and we end up having so much fun just smacking each other with the ladder. Theguest referee mode is a rip offof Smackdown 1 but still its still fun. You also get back stage arenas, which add to the replay value. Still some complaints are the graphics are kind of blurry ( but what 64 game isn't like that ), and to see how much THQ packed into Smackdown 2 for playstation, its kind of dissapointing to see just the ladder match get in for No Mercy. but still this game with a couple friends will keep you entertained for a while. have fun with this one	1
Its worth all of the money that is spent on it but you will fint that it is also very hard I whoud sugg geting the stragety guide and than buy it.	1
I wouldn't get this game now due to all the new wrestlers in the WWF including the alliance of WCW and ECW.  But when it first came out it was the best game out there.  It is very fun to play.  The only thing is it is hard to learn how to do the special moves of the wrestlers(ex. People's Elbow, Stone Cold Stunner, Sink Face, 3D, must I go on!) If you don't care about how up to date the wrestler's are and just care about the quality of fun, get it.  If you do care about the up to date of the wrestlers wait for a new wrestling video game to come out.	1
Now when you make a sequel to a game, this is what I'm talking about! It takes the WM2K engine (which is pretty old and just needs to be scrapped altoghether THQ) and just supplies it with new moves and modes, but this is a good thing, and who doesn't want more of that? The thing I like best about this game is the way you can slam opponents through tables, perfect! I also like the Iornman match and the Guest ref match too, and the Ladder match is the perverbial icing on the cake. The guys at THQ really knew what they were doing when they got the WWF license and since they are on contract with the WWF, expect more of this goodness within the next few years.	1
the gamplay is great, the wreaselers look real, its as great game but 3 problems!!one whwn your opponent is getting up and u hit em un the top with a move that hit it dos not hit em. 2 is how long it takes to create a pep (wreasler).1 hour to 40 minits!! third is when you do a special four a first move they kick out! stiil buy it thu peace out...	1
no mercy has got to be the worst wwf game i have ever played. for one thing no mercy does not have special entrances like wrestlemania 2000 does. in no mercy  the titantron does not play when you make your entrance. also in no mercy every tag team comes out seperately and you have to buy everything from the smackdown mall and where's the fun in that? also the box says up to 10 backstage areas and there are only six. in conclusion smackdown 2 is the better buy.	-1
A fantastic game and a fantastic farewell to the greatest wrestling game engine of all time.	1
I won't go on about the different options found in the game, as other reviews have covered that. What I will say is that this game is by far one of the funnest games you'll play on the N64. Even those who despise wrestling will find themselves having fun with this game, as it is amazingly easy to pick up and play. There is some considerable slow down, but that can be dealt with by turning off background music during gameplay - a small sacrifice to make. The Create a Wrestler function adds a great amount of time to it's replayability, as you can make dozens of new wrestlers to play with. As was stated in an earlier review, there is a bug that causes info to be lost. Buyers might want to be cautious about buying this game, and its because of this frustrating bug that I give this game a 4 and not 5 stars. Otherwise, the game itself is a blast. Get three friends together and plug this one in for a great time.	1
First off,  there is a glitch in the game that will cause you to lose saved game info.  Like many others,  it happened to me a couple of days ago. ....  This glitch,  therefore,  should not be a deterrent. That being said,  this is a great game.  Fans of Wrestlemania 2000 will pick up on No Mercy fast,  as the same engine is used.  Things run smoother,  and hit detection has been cleaned up.  With the exception of a stray "People's Elbow,"  hits actually appear to hit when they cause damage. The storyline has been improved upon,  although it isn't perfect.  In WM2K,  there was very little that would happen.  Interfering superstars would say one of two things,  Vince would always take your title and face you in a singles match. Here in No Mercy,  the plot can change based on whether you win or lose.  Alliances are formed and broken,  and there's a large variety of matches you can end up in.  It can become repetitive,  however,  as you have to lose matches  to complete all the storylines.  worse yet,  even on expert difficulty,  it can be hard to lose a match. The AI is about the same as before,  and increasing the difficulty only increases the ammount of time the CPU spends countering you.  While the game is still a solid challenge,  one would hope for a smarter opponent. The quests for the titles are fun,  and the characters look,  walk,  and fight like the real Superstars.  Unfortunately,  in WWF Championship mode,  they all talk like Steve Austin or the Rock. The gameplay is near flawless,  with the only flaw being the slowdown when four characters are involved.  They have fixed my biggest gripe  with WM2K  by adding more tag moves,  including the Dudley Death Drop and special flying attacks.  While this doesn't add too much,  the  gameplay was already great to begin with. Create a Superstar is even better this time around,  adding more to work with,  including more finishers,  more clothing,  and more taunts.  and with the Smackdown! Mall,  you can purchase even more.  And this time around,  you can make women wrestlers. With Smacdown! Mall,  you can purchase props,  weapons,  special moves,  and wrestling attire,  both familliar and original.  Purchase Mankind's original outfit,  the Rock's $800  shirt,  or original outfit 4,  and use them to better customise your superstars.  Can't find a finisher you like?  Perhaps trhe Fireball,  Burning Combo,  or Continuous DVD/Powerbomb. While I wish that they had the "Create a Stable" and "Create a taunt" options from Smackdown! 2:  Know your Role (For the Playstation),  neither feature is necessary.  The same is true for the naming of finishers from the original Smackdown!,  which appears in neither game.  These are all minor flavor isuues,  and do not spoil the game. All in all,  No Mercy is a great game.  It would have five stars easily if not for the slowdown,  the fact they all  talk the same,  and the need to lose against a rather dumb AI.  If none of these bother you,  this is an excellent game.  I would buy it with no hesitation myself,  given all the cool features.  I recommend it to any fan of the earlier games,  any fand of the WWF,  or any fan of Wrestling in general.	1
This game I think is a very Great game I played it and I was thinking look at all the stuff you can do in this The Rock HHH look very very bad they could of done a better job on them. I think this game is great.	1
Based in most part on THQ's previous wrestling engine (see WCW/NWO Revenge & Wrestlemania 2000), WWF Mercy shines in N64 splendor. The opening sequence is pretty remarkable for N64, pushing graphics, sound, and visual effects to the limits. The game itself is both very similar to WCW/NWO Revenge and Wrestlemania 2000, making wrestling very fun without having to memorize ridiculous button combinations like you do for the majority of PS-1 games.  The moves are even more fluid, realistic, and the collision detection is very good. In No Mercy you have many new current WWF Superstars to wrestle with including Rakishi, Eddie G, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, The Dudley's and many others.  In addition to the Superstars already present, there are many you need to unlock during the progress through your game.  It is rumored that even Andre The Giant is one of the hidden characters.  Also added is many more arena's and backstage area's.  There is a parking lot, backstage, boiler room, bar, and arena's include Backlash, Survivor Series, Smackdown, Raw, KOTR, Wrestlemania, and more.  The outside ring area's are pretty cool.  I like the bar, because you can do maneuvers off a pool table!!! Also there is a new match that will makes the game VERY challenging: The Ladder Match!  What an awesome idea, however, I think it needs to be tweaked just slightly.  It is very hard to win said match, as it takes longer to climb and tap the 'A' button than your fallen opponent takes to recover, often resulting in your opponent to knock the ladder over when you are ever so close. The create-a-wrestler mode has been expanded greatly as well.  Many will like the new features, but the saving component could be a bit easier and more clear. The Championship mode is the heart of the game, where instead of going a whole year like you did in Wrestlemania 2000, in No Mercy, you pick a belt to chase after.  The belts are broken down into individual chapters resulting in anywhere from 6-10 bouts.  What is really neat is the cut scenes/angles bewteen the matches and how the story unfolds depending on whether you win or lose a match.  If you win matches you earn money in which you can spend at the Smackdown mall for additional moves, costumes, weapons, or hidden characters/arena's. Okay, now after all that praise, what makes it shy of 5 stars?  Like I stated previously, the ladder match can be a little to hard or unrealistic even in the easy mode.  The manual is a little vague in areas (like stats & shopping).  The saving component could be a bit more clear as well as the ranking tables.  Lastly some experienced gamers may even find the easy levels difficult when it comes to handicapped matches.  You get double-teamed often which makes it very hard to recover and win even if you get an early lead.  Some matches you win on pure luck, not on skill or how badly you pummel the CPU controlled character. But all this aside, this is the best wrestling game I have ever played yet on any platform.	1
Ok I bought this game 1 hour ago and I'm already thinking of excusses to take it back! This game has nice graphics, but it feels like I'm flying in an air ballon!! Do all the planes blow up with one hit?! I prefere they fly around alittle more with some smoke and then die?! I'm playing it tonight for a couple of hours but in the morning I'm going back to (the store)! (...)	-1
I love role playing games, and the Playstation 2 graphics were incredible on some of the other games we've played. When I popped Orphen into the CD player, I was really expecting something spectacular. Unfortunately, the game didn't quite live up to the promise.  You play a male, Orphen, in his late teens, who is a loner with an attitude. He has a brother-sister pair with him, Cleo and Magnus, who spend the entire time sniping at each other and at him. "Shut up," he snarls at them. "Well, duh!" the girl cries out in response to something else. When water breaks in, her panic cry was not of the danger they were in, but "My favorite clothes!!"  Their two 'bodyguards' aren't much better - with their bickering, I actually cheered when a monster crab grabbed one and threw him into the water. I kept hoping that one would grab the annoying siblings as well, and get rid of them. Come to think of it, even the main character needed a good swat in the head.  The magic Orphen uses is intriguing. His weapons have names like "Bite of Lightning," "Sword of the Fallen Devil," and "Hand of Pyro." You don't have to remember their names - he cries them out quite often enough. That's when you're lucky enough to be in combat ... a lot of the time the game simply freezes when you're moving, going into a pre-set series of actions that mostly involve the main characters yelling at or picking on each other.  If you could only skip through them, it might be playable. But you can't.  The graphics are reasonably good, the monsters you meet are interesting, but there isn't anything to move you along through the game, except for the desperate hope that SOMETHING will come along and knock some sense into the characters. Unfortunately for everyone involved, this never happens.  If you're looking for a great RPG, I'd wholeheartedly recommend Final Fantasy IX over this game. If you already have FFIX, then you might rent this one to understand just how good the FFIX team really is.	-1
Orphen was another prime example of a rushed game that wanted to be a launch title. It contains a little bit of [bad] voice acting at the beginning, then from there they gave up and no one moves their mouth. As for gameplay, it's very limited, pretty boring, and overall lacking. ... I don't even know why they call it orphen. You just live out someone elses adventure as you join their party. The story is one of the worst ever made. ... my point is the story [is bad], and everything else about this game [is bad], it's the ... game that ever ... . Use the disk as it was obviously intended to be used as. A frizbee.	-1
This was my first PS2 game...I bought it two weeks before I even got my PS2.  I remember looking at the super hi-res graphics in the pics (it both looked more impressive than it was, and I never played a Dreamcast by this point), and practically dreaming about it.  While my every hope and dream wasn't met with the revolutionary game I was expecting, this game was a nice unique adventure that I still occasionally play today. This game was IMO easily better than Evergrace, Eternal Ring, and even Summoner, the other three launch PS2 games, and I liked it more than some that have come out since.  The game isn't stupid like many people say; it was just shrouded in a large number of bad decisions for the overall production.  The graphics were nice, the battle system inventive, the plot decent, and the voice acting good. The game's story involves a time-lapse in which Orphen is shot into a time and particular story, and when it's over, he is shot back to the begining, only to play through another.  While remembering that something is odd between times he goes back and starts over, his memory of those he met, the places he's been, or the searching for the artifact called the Crystal Egg (which can control time), soon no longer exist, and similar plot twists occur in the three scenarios. While not as linear as Final Fantasy X, it's also nowhere near as epic, nor does it make as much sense.  Really the plot, while with some nice original moments, really seems like an excuse to have a game starring the decently famous character: the Sorcerous Stabber Orphen.  The ending is pretty weak, despite the gorgeous music during the big end-credit sequence (there are two kinds of end credit sequences), and the writting of some scenes is simply terrible.  Not to mention, there are just too many parts where something just happens to go wrong or right, and as such, things happen the way they do...which is sometimes the way they just happened, only now again, but ever so slightly different.  However, due to the game's shortness (about 12 hours altogether), if you can tolerate a chunk of cheezy lines and repeditive or silly sequences, this game isn't much to bear. The voice work during the cutscenes is great, however.  Sure, they're all very, very annoying, but it's because the original writers only partially understood the true character of the Orphen anime saga.  The voices are full of life, energy, emotion, and Quinton Flynn being chosen to play Orphen's role was one of the most brilliant moments of game-voice casting, ever!  The character movement during the game isn't anywhere as nice...the big thing about it is that when a character is knocked over, the common thing for them to do isn't to stand back up, but to reverse-fall.  Moments of almost unbearable tackiness start to clutter up any feelings of reality the game offers. The game is, apart from the now outdated graphics and terrible movement, a rather believable and entertaining fantasy epic.  This mostly comes because the ways the graphics are handled.  The polygon counts in almost every other launch title was higher than in this, but the colors are vibrant, saturated and glowing, as well as the lighting very true-to-life, and the art direction rather decent.  The monster battles are very cinematic in feel as unless hit by an attack, no enemy or ally HP display is projected onto the screen, while the camera follows the action very flashily, full of rapid camera-cuts, fast motion, and tons of flying effects.  And, my favorite graphical touch by far: the sun, when looked upon, shines that great line of light that just barely misses hitting your eye perpendictularly, like in the movies...a great zenith, nice color temperature, and nice shadow work too. Truthfully, while I love this game, I do not recommend it to anyone except the most patient of gamers.  However, since it has so many of my memories in it, and it's well acted out and well colored (and that I'm trying to write an Orphen movie, inspired to be a sequel to the series), I know I'm going to be playing this game for years to come...despite that I know it's just me.  I REALLY wish that they would either remake this title, or create another Orphen game (sequel, or side-story), since this game had shining potential, and nice imagination.  If only the testers were able to mouth opinions as well as say simply: "yup, when I hit the square, I jump."	1
the attemt to make the game exciting by putting a lot of stupid puzzles makes this game a not very fun game at all. the battle system is alright and i like the anime sequences that take place. its rather annoying when you get trhough little puzzles, maze like areas that take you ages to figure out. Im used to the experience points and equiping weapons you bought or forged, since its in most other RPGs that ive played. also the fact that you cant skip movies makes it annoying when you die after watching a long movie because you have to watch it again.	-1
Ok, so maybe it is only once in a great while that I give a one star rating to something, but this game is so vile, and disappointing that I had to. Not only are the graphics sub-par, but the controls are awkward, and the dubbing is the worst I have ever seen... ANYWHERE!  At first I thought it was kind of funny that they would start talking before thier mouth moved, and then continued flailing thier arms much after the dialog had stopped, but the humor was soon lost, and it just became a poorly timed marionette show. This is a poor game, I cannot reccomend it to anyone.	-1
This is by far the WORST role playing game I've ever played! The Battle systum (STINKS)! You have 3 buttons wich you equip weapons to, every button executes that weapon, but you can't move and the voice programing gets anoying! And the voice acting is VERY poorly acted! There is NOT one message you read in this game! It is all the charecters voices, so those of you who have no volume, are scrwed! And the story line, HA! The worst! It seems like a 4 year old worte it who knew "cool words" like "damn" and "hell" it is very sad! It is so corney you will die laughing!(actually, thats the best thing about it!)And the game play hours stink! And so does the ending! The graphics are good, but thats it! It is above all boring! oh! There are some cartoon clips that arn't SO BAD.And you have absolutely no options on where to go or secret places! You just go straight through the story line on what you're supposed to do! Do your self a BIG favor! Don't buy this game, here is my over-all raitings- (1-5 stars) Game play hours-** Battle systum-* Re-play value-* Storyline-* Graphics-**** Music-*** Sound effects-** Voice programing-** Mapping-* Neeed i say more?	-1
This is one of those games that was all hype and nothing to back it up.  the previews looked amazing but the aftermath is that Orphen has ver dissapointing gameplay.  the only good thing about this game was the battles. the battle system was very innovative and fun to learn, however this game will dissapoint even the most hardcore fans of the anime.	-1
This game is quite possibly the stupidest game I have ever played.  From the first (and ONLY) time I played it, it got on my nerves.  The voice acting is terrible and really annoying. In the very beginning on the boat, you walk into a room and the girl whines "Ohh NOOOO, my jeans are RUINED!" That did it for me, I just snapped the game off right there. The graphics are bad for the PS2, and the way the characters move is all jerky and repetative. They wave their arms when they talk and then kinda forget to stop waving them after they finally shut up. The combat system not very good, you just stand in one place and idly blast enemies with badly-animated spells. If you see this one on the shelf, don't even give it a second glance, just move on and get something else. ANYTHING can be better than this.	-1
This game is what's wrong with so called RPG's today, or any game as a matter of fact. In an RPG i thought that it was Role Playing, not some kind of comic book. You just don't play most of this game, you just watch. The battle system is just plain stupid, who just stand there and the enemy's come toward's you. The save points are at the most random spot's of the game and the cut scenes are just horrible, the voice acting to the dubing. And they are BORING, if you die you have to watch them all over again, and you can't skip them. Don't buy this game, watch the anime, it is basicly the same thing!	-1
... Now, with MDK2, I can still say that it's the coolest game ever. Kurt is once again called to save the world 2 minutes after the 1st 1nvasion. Tis time, it's Shwing Shwang who wants to domnate the earth. So, 3 charcters must stop this. Kurt Hectic, the hero from the 1st MDK, Max, a robtic 4-armed dog with a love of guns, and Dr. Fluke Hawkins, just some weird scientist. The graphics are great and very detailed. The parachute is the most reconizble thing from MDK. I'm glad they still have it. Max is the best charceter. He has  200 health and can use 4 guns. ... He's a good normal hero. The doctor..well you gotta use your brainpower in order to suceed with him. Excelent game.	1
When I first heard of this game I was skeptic at first, this is because I had beaten all the other BOF games and those were okay, some of them kinda boring (3) but I was wrong! This game is amazing, one of the best RPG's on the playstation. This game is for people who like their rpgs simple but have certain quirks, like the fishing game, which you can use a special fishing rod control, and learning the enemys ablities. Also the plot and the characters rule, to the silent Scias to the funny robot thing, Ershin. The plot is great too, going between two different dragons. Buy this game right now, but, after you beat Final Fantsy IX ^_^	1
I loved this game so much!	1
Excellent game exciting gameplay you can play over 75 hrs in this game I liked it very much	1
Love the game thanks! This game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat. Thanks	1
Really Fun video game. I bought it for my brother and I can't stop playing it. Ive played the others and I would have to say that this one is the best	1
given it's original system. I gotta say I was impressed. the graphics were just unlike anything I've seen for this console. .. you'd easily mistaken it for a ps2 game. .. it's that remarkable. And ps2 (to this day) is one of the best systems to ever hit market. I'd highly recommend getting it if ya haven't previously owned one before. it's a worthy collection. you won't regret it.	1
I bought this game due to childish nostalgia, as I had played it years ago when I was about 8-9.  Needless to say, I didn't remember a single thing about this game.  The story is engrossing, as you play from both the protaganist and antagonist POV's.  The minigames are fun and challenging, and scattered throughout the game.  The battles are, yes, random, but only feel draining when you are personally tired and wanting to find a place to save.  The battles are spread out enough that you aren't caught in the trap of walking a couple of steps between each encounter.  The dragon forms are easy to take advantage of, but are at least a little bit off-set by the constant draining of mana.  (Their most powerful attacks cost little to no MP, though.)  Gameplay itself lasts several hours, without becoming too repetitive.  Fishing is annoying, though.  Just putting that out there.  Anyways, short of the long is this is a powerfully engrossing game that will satisfy a (now) strong sense of nostalgia.	1
Capcom's Breath of Fire RPG series has not stood the test of time all that well, and no new installments have been offered in almost a decade. But personally, I really like this one in particular. The story, characters, spells, abilities, etc. are all fairly run-of-the-mill JRPG fare. At the same time, they are presented in a way that made me forget just how conventional it was. Characters are colorful, and the 2-D sprites are animated fluidly - even if their animation is a tad limited. The sound is also a bit limited, but the quality is good. The music is also a very strong point of the game, and it certainly adds significant depth to the whole of the game. The battle system is the same as it ever was, and just as good as it ever was, so no complaints there. Besides the faulty camera and occasionally awkward field controls, there really is not too much worth complaining about if you don't mind the overall lack of originality - and the fact that it's pretty easy. But it's fun from the get-go and kept me interested for the roughly 34 hours it took me to finish the game (and I barely touched the side-quests, so I missed out on a lot). Nothing to write home about, but recommended.	1
Before I go into my review, I'd like to point out that some people reviewing the game seem to have done so without PLAYING the game.  One review talks about "stragglers, some of which can transform."  No one in this game except Ryu can transform.  That reviewer also states that the game is a continuation of the ongoing BOF storyline, which it isn't at all, as the Goddess Myria has nothing to do with this game.  Another reviewer mentions that the game has only 8 directional control, unlike the Final Fantasy games.  Well, that'd be because the game uses 2D sprites, not 3D models, and for every angle there has to be a different sprite.  Unlimited directions simply are not possible in a 2D game - even if it's on a 3D background.  Moving on...  What Breath of Fire IV has that so many RPGs lack, is a solid, coherent story that doesn't rely on the Japanese convention of pseudo-philosophical and over-convoluted mish-mash.  The characters are fleshed out pretty well, some better than others, but all with some measure of substance.  The battle system is brilliant - following the standard formula enough to make it simple for newcomers to the series or genre to jump right in, but adding enough complexity to reward the long-time RPGers who crave a little something extra.  The combo system and all of the variations on the standard attacks that it creates make combat much more interesting.  The character animations for combat and cut scenes are incredible.  Capcom used 3,000 frames of animation for every major character, which is simply unheard of in 2D games, and the pastel art style makes them well-integrated into the 3D backgrounds.  And speaking of those backgrounds, there is a lot more attention to detail in every location, from small meaningless objects in random rooms to the splendor of the Emperor's Palace.  This game is - for its generation - simply gorgeous.  The music is of collectible quality - Yoshino Aoki delivers a performance that makes the rather odd jazzy tracks of Breath of Fire III a distant memory, and puts her on the same tier as some of the bigger name composers.  The eastern-influenced themes go well with the overall Asian aesthetic, making the games various elements gel together seamlessly to provide complete immersion.  I really can't say enough about this game, but my final words are simply this:  Buy it.	1
This game is one of the best RPG's I've ever played. The game has a great storyline,great graphics, and fantastic gameplay. So if you want a good RPG for the Playstation this game is for you.	1
Many have said that this game is not as good as BOF 3.  I must part ways with that opinion.  BoF 4 does what any sequel should do- it takes the strengths of the previous game and leaves behind some of the weaknesses.  That said, I think that BoF3 and BoF4 are equally awesome.  If you have the money and time, quite simply, buy BOTH.  Some of my thoughts in a compare and contrast would go like this:  -More Dragon forms and variations were in 3; however each Dragon form in this game (4) has more than a handful of abilities.  Each Dragon form in this game has about six or seven unique abilities.  Also, the Dragons each have a spell that is like a summon; this is a neat angle for those who enjoy Final Fantasy spells like Ramuh and Titan. -(Edited 6/18/11 after replaying both games) Overall I like fishing in 3 better; however the fishing side game is still strong in this installment of Breath of Fire. -There are more skills for your party to learn, and a new combo system in 4.  I came up with an 82 hit combo!  There is a tactical challenge in this game that is far greater.  There are twelve masters, and this is one of the features that made BoF 3 so interesting.  Also, there is more diversity in creating combos. -4 is broken into four chapters, and the last two allow for less linear gameplay and storylines.  You must search for the Dragons around the world. -The benefits of doing the Fairie village may be better in 3, but the village sidequest in 4 is more accessible.  It is easier to understand what you need to do. -The graphics are better in this game (4), more detailed and there are some good special moves animation. -The music in both are awesome!  I like the boss music, the dungeons have some good music, really the music is great in creating the right attitude:  For instance, a song with a creepy feeling when you are investigating in caves, or a light hearted tune in the fairie village, the music is well chosen and prepared.    I really enjoyed this breath of fire.  I believe that 3 and 4 were really good, and Dragon Quarter was totally awesome (the BOF for Playstation 2).  Each Breath of Fire seems to get better and better.  I can't wait for the next one!	1
When I bought BOF IV on its release, I was thoroughly unimpressed with the simple plot and rather poor graphics. However, being (as I am) temporarily broke, with the prospect of any new PS 2 games being but a distant horizon-blip, I decided to give it another go, and I have to say, I am delighted I did. BOF IV is not a game about technical bedazzlement or complicated quests with much philosophising. It is not a Final Fantasy game! Nor, in fifteen years' time, will it be remembered as a Classic, like the FInal Fantasies. But it's still an excellent homage to the early days of RPGs like Shining Wisdom, the original Zelda, and The Legend of Oasis games. Briefly, the plot: Cray and Princess Nina are investigating the disappearance of Nina's sister Elina, when they run across Ryu, a strange boy with no past and no direction. Their quest to find Elina and give Ryu a life takes them across several continents, accumulating a cast of memorable characters and unravelling a plot that involves Dragons, Civil War and theological Entities. What I am most impressed with is the simplicity and clarity with which BOF IV plays. Stylishly retro, the graphics are actually rather good - with more frames of animation and bigger, brighter characters than before - and some lovely spell effects. Everything is drawn in real-time, and the option to rotate the camera a full 360 degrees compensates much for the lousy camera angles one often runs across. The control system, too, is very easy to get to grips with and user-friendly - spells and abilities are learned and interchangeable - and the Combo system is a nice, innovative touch. The characters are decent, well-thought out personalities, but lack diversity. So far, so good. Sadly, BOF IV, like Onimusha after it, is just a little too far entrenched on the side of 'mundane' to be a truly memorable classic. It does take a good three or four hours of play time before the plot and characterisation picks up and by this time, you may well be unable to forgive the game its rather uninspiring opening. Similarly confusing, and dull, are the playable early sections starring Fou-Lu, the Laguna Loire to Ryo's Squall. Like the rest of the game, thankfully, these sections get progressively better, and by the end, you'll have formed an affectionate attachment to BOF IV. All in all, an excellent little title with one or two sadly fatal flaws that keep it from being a Classic, BOF IV is a definite reccommendation if you can get it cheap...	1
I have to stop and give Capcom another round of applause, because they did it again.  I thought after playing Breath Of Fire III, that the series couldn't get any better.  I was wrong.  As soon as I started to play Breath Of Fire(BOF) IV, I was reminded of XENOGEARS.  Another RPG for the PS1, but made by Squaresoft.  I absolutely loved that game.  The only thing that I didn't really like about XENOGEARS, was the fact that the main character was a big wimp.  This game puts into effect the XENOGEARS feel, but they put into place an awesome Main Character.  It's hard to put into words how great a game like this can be, except my recommendation for you is to somehow play this game.  Of course with how this game was introduced to the United States, it won't have as many copies sold as BOF III, becasue It isn't being mass produced in the same manner.  It's too bad actually.  But please, if you enjoy playing RPG's, or just like to play great games.  PLAY IT!!!  You will NOT be disapointed.	1
From the first BOF down to this one, the quality has gradually declined. Sure, it looks prettier than it used to, but with few weapons, fewer spells and less variety with each passing episode, the series is looking more than a little thread-bare. The combat system is good, though it hasn't changed hardly at all since the last time. The spells and skills are copied more or less directly from number III, including such goodies as Flare, Jump and other low-cost, useful abilities. The multi-elemental spell thing was cool but made less useful by the inclusion of a variety of useless or near-useless combinations. Some of the high-power spells require the combination of elements boss-level monsters are immune to and do an overwhelming amount of damage to regular monsters; they simply aren't necessary. The monsters are just slighter higher resolutions of old beasties from the last three games and the dragon spells, while nice to look at, just aren't all that useful or interesting. I used them once and then stopped using them alltogether. The fairies are about the only thing that's improved over the last installation, with multiple uses for fairies and the opportunity to build a significant and powerful attack force with the fairy spells. The movie clips were a nice touch, but they aren't as good as some other RPG movie clips. Check out the new Chrono Trigger/FFIII disc and you'll see what I mean. On the whole, it just wasn't all that great. Still, I've now defeated all four games several times over. When BOF V comes out, I'll check it out before buying it, though.	-1
Well now..... Yet another Breath of Fire, I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this one For one the battle system is kinda lame compared to Breath of Fire 1-3 except for the dragons they were designed pretty well except for the aura and astral Dragons thier design sucked. But other than that I guess the game was alright.....	1
While having only played the first game for SNES, I found this game to be pretty darn good.  An incredible opening sequence, interesting storyline (though it did have a tendancy to dry up from time to time), decent game play, good control, and while being a more a fan of the Final Fantasy series I find this to be an all around good RPG.  I'll say it definately inspires me to check out the previous two.  As for those who say the control sucks, buy an analog controller.  It is what I used and I didn't have any problems	1
Every aspect of this game was improved a truckload since BoF 3...namely, playing the game isn't painful anymore.  I'm a huge fan of the series (played it since the first, loved them all, even if after 2 hours or so the game got repetetive), but this game still lacks in several ways. 1) Control is...less than stellar.  Poor camera angles, rigid movement (8 principle directions, not free range like FF series games), and awkward speed changes make it hard to move exactly where you need to be to read that dang sign. 2) Graphics - The sprite animation is incredible, but the 3d graphics this game posesses just hurt my feelings.  If Square can make leaps and bounds, you can too, Capcom! 3) Fishing - Capcom made this way too hard in this game.  They kinda perfected the system in BOF3 and then decided to butcher it again for 4, I suppose. On the bright side, the game has several plusses: 1) All the mini games are really fun, worth your time, and actually beneficial towards the flow of the game.  Thank God. 2) The music and plot get increasingly more complex, linear, and sensical as the series progresses. 3) YOU CAN SKIP THE ANIMATION SEQUENCES FOR LONG SPELLS!  Square, take notes!  This makes the game SO much less painful to play.	1
Graphics: 5/10 - The colour shading is nice when you're playing outside, but for the rest of the time, this looks pretty effortless and droopy. It's also hard to see where a passage leads. Sound: 5/10 - The usual cartoon racing score hangs in the background, while the cars don't do anything too dramatic with their engines. Value: 5/10 - Most racing games are worth the money because they're entertaining, but to make a long story short, this one isn't really worth paying for unless you're a really big fan of the muppets. Overall: 5/10 - This is the sort of game you play in the game or record store while your waiting for Mum to finish her grocery shopping. In a game where you can hardly see where you're going, is it worth even playing? Yes, but only if Mum takes a couple of hours to find a broccoli stick.	-1
The Muppets are just the best, and it is so great to see a really fun Muppet game(especially after that horid Game Boy Color mess).  "Muppet Race Mania" is a truly fun and fantastic game for the Playstation.  First off the sheer number of racers at your disposal is terrific.  The games starts out with only a few but a cheat is provided to open all of them-so don't fret.  They are all great characters too-Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzy, Rizzo, The Swedish Chef, and even BEAN BUNNY!  What a treat(Bean rocks!).  Also when you unlock certain secrets on the battle course you can use new characters to play them.  For example if you beat "The Muppet Movie" battle coure you can battle as Sweetums.  Anyway they all have a different kart that can be combined with another racer.  There is also a good number of tracks to play(the stunt tracks are stupid but hey nothing is perfect), and by using the adventure mode you can access secrets that allow you to play all the course as a battle mode.  There is even a Fraggle Rock course!  No I ain't lyin'!The game overall is tremedously fun to play.  Each Muppet's personality shines through.  The graphics are great; capturing that whole Jim Henson atmosphere.  The courses(some course have to be unlocked)follow the movies very well, and they offer lots of shorcuts and gameplay variety too.  A little video is played before each one.  The playcontrol isn't as tight as it could be, but it isn't terrible in anyway shape or form.  And younger players can select an option that allows them the have the computer steer while they push the acceleration button. The games has a lot of play modes; racing, reverse racing, adventure(in which you drive around the course picking up items to unlock secrets), battle-which has a few modes of play-a boss battle mode(where you battle a "boss" character) and a chicken race(where you attempt to catch chickens.  One flaw of the game is its lack of items.  You only have a fish, penguin bomb, and a rocket launching chicken.  But each character does have a special move that can be used to run over or slow other racers down. All in all this is a hot game.  It retains to pizzazz of the Muppets and reinvigorates that kart racing genre(which has been lax for sometime).  Little kids might have a little trouble with this game but little kids should be reading anyway.  The price of the game is great and if you don't buy it at least rent it and give it a try.	1
If your looking for another dinio crisis 1, look else where, where the 1st one was pretty mediocre and somewhat boring, this new one is really fast and has lots of dino blasting action! I hesitate to call this ''survivor horror'' more like action, arcade-styled. The graphics are amazing, many new dinos and weapons have been added, our fave babe Regina looks a LOT better (yummy buns!)  Blah blah... get this.. lets hope part 3 comes out soon!	1
Dino Crisis, the original, was an o.k. Resident Evil style game with dino's thrown in for fun. Well, Dino Crisis 2 breaks the mold of the Resident Evil game play style and implements a tremendously addicting new way to kill dino's! More of an arcade tomb raider shooter, DC2 really brings home the feeling of "walking with dinosaur's". There are more than 10 different types of dino's, most of them very familiar (some are from Jurassic Park). Game play is very easy (I've only played the normal difficulty so far), yet extremely entertaining. Each dead dinosaur is worth a number of "points". Kill a few dino's in a row and build up combo points. Kill a dino when it's attacking and receive a counter multiplier. All the points you collect are used to buy better weapons, ammo, tools, and health items. Since your able to hold two weapons at a time in DC2, getting better weapons with more points is a very important part of the game. Overall, DC2 is far better than the original Dino Crisis, yet creates a new type of survival horror, "Blast-A-Dino" Horror.	1
This game...IS SO SICK! Take the bad 4ssery or Resident Evil vs. Jurassic park and make it a playstation game and this is it. Yes it does go off the Survival horror track a bit in favor of action but the game is SOOOOOOOOOO FUN! There's also obvious influence in the future Resident evil 4 to be seen in this release. The whole ammo and weapon purchasing for instance, The 2 weapon attacks as well. But i have to say the coolest aspect to this game is the aquatic segments....SOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOL! Why hasn't this been remade? Either way you owe it to yourself to check this out.	1
Great game! Classic PS1 fun!	1
Excellent game, Highly recommend it to every Dino fan	1
An island overrun by dinosaurs, and 2 survivors fighting for their lives and a way to escape. There are 2 playable characters, each with unique skills. Plenty of guns to upgrade, there's a combo system. I beat it 3 times, each on a harder difficulty. You get better at it the longer you play. The graphics are top notch for PSX! You won't believe it. Very fun survival horror!	1
I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reasons.  I can tell you having only gotten to see a few episodes of the series total that the show itself is  entertaining.	1
a true masterpiece buy this game	1
I loved this game. It is super fun and just difficult enough to be challenging but not so bad that you are frustrated and stuck. The dino's are wicked fun and unnerving. I love Regina she is awesome. Thumbs up!! ^_^	1
The main problem with the original Dino Crisis is how it was exactly like the Resident Evil series in nearly every single way. I remember when Dino Crisis first hit the market, and everyone thought it would stand right next to the Resident Evil series as the next big groundbreaking thing. Six years later, and unfortunately we find that it didn't turn out that way. Turns out the Resident Evil games have gone on to become classics while the Dino Crisis series was left in the dark.  If you guys can remember back to the late 90's, the Dino Crisis series was pretty popular during the time when 3D games were the talk of the town for the N64 and Playstation (and the days of 2D games dominating the market were, unfortunately, just about over). Dino Crisis was a cool game because it was creepy, intense and pretty fun, just like Resident Evil. I think the similarity between Resident Evil and Dino Crisis turned out to be Dino Crisis's downfall, because players obviously preferred blasting zombies over dinosaurs.  Anyway, moving along to the review of Dino Crisis 2. Capcom decided to drastically change things for the second dinosaur adventure. I don't know if they did this because the first Dino Crisis was too similar to Resident Evil (and Capcom feared DC2 might be labeled a rip-off) or if Capcom simply felt a change would make Dino Crisis fans happier. Whatever Capcom's intentions were, Dino Crisis 2 completely blows the first one to pieces. I *completely* agree with Capcom's decision to change the direction of the series to a more action-packed style of gameplay. We already HAVE Resident Evil's creepy atmosphere to keep us happy, so there really was no point carrying on the Dino Crisis series the same way. It's a welcome change by me, because Dino Crisis 2 is MUCH more fun. Don't think I'm bashing the first Dino Crisis.  It's just that we already have Resident Evil, so it was a good move (in my opinion) to make the second Dino Crisis nothing but *total* action.  All the reviews of Dino Crisis 2 are true: you pretty much do nothing but run around shooting dinosaurs. While you're running around, many times you will hear footsteps, and you don't know if those footsteps are behind you, in front of you, or from a tree to the left or right of you where a dinosaur is waiting to jump out in front of you and attack. This game may not be as creepy as the first Dino Crisis (and therefore, the Resident Evil series) but you'll *certainly* come across many dinosaurs in this adventure that will scare the living poop out of you, believe me. Dinosaurs are all OVER the place in this game.  Big ones, small ones, and the neat thing is, for someone like me who never grew up fascinated with dinosaurs (unlike all the boys in my 2nd grade class) I STILL have a ton of fun learning about these mysterious creatures, thanks to the storyline in the game which gives you a LOT of detail on the dinosaurs you have (or haven't yet) come across.  All you have to do is look around and you will certainly come across information that will help you learn about all the dinosaurs in the game.  I wouldn't say the difficulty is that hard, because every time you kill a dinosaur you get points, and these points are used to buy items and weapons. It's amazing to me how it hardly cost anything to completely fill any one of your guns. But at the same time, the game isn't easy enough where I can afford to buy the really expensive guns right away. I have to keep shooting at dinosaurs to be able to earn enough points to buy the REALLY awesome weapons. So it's not THAT easy. But it seems whenever I get low on medicine or bullets, a shop/save point is always right around the corner.  I love how many of the dinosaurs require a strategy to beating them.  Especially the big dinosaurs.  There's a few big dinosaurs in the game where you have to run, turn around and shoot, and then run forward again in order to defeat them.  Just like the first Dino Crisis, those flying winged dinosaurs give me a lot of trouble. I haven't found an easy way to defeat them yet.  All I can do is run away and hope they don't catch up to me. This is one bloody and violent game too. Blood pours from the dinosaurs when you shoot them, and a puddle of blood forms on the ground right where you kill them. The dead dinosaurs lay in a puddle of blood. It's gross, but cool, too.  The graphics are REALLY good. Certain parts of the game feel so real that you can't HELP but be a little scared when a dinosaur is chasing you. Especially when a big dinosaur is pounding the ground and the first thought that runs through your head is to run away, but sometimes you'll find that standing up and fighting is the best way to deal with it.  This game also gets my vote for some of the very best cutscenes I've ever seen in a game.  Not only do they look good, but they always deliver with plenty of action and excitement.  You won't see cutscenes like that in the Resident Evil series (or if you do, it's not ALL the time).  If you want, you can skip them.  But make sure you watch them at least once, and you'll agree!  The story, well, I'm not much of a story person, but I find the story here to be interesting because it's about going back to the dinosaur time, and you walk around finding clues to help get you back to the present time. Don't worry, this game is mostly about shooting dinosaurs and staying alive, but you come across many clues in the game that go along with the story.  I think Dino Crisis 2 works great for the players who want a lot of action, and the players who want a solid storyline.  There's other cool things you can do in the game.  It's not all about running around shooting dinosaurs.  You will eventually come across an underwater part of the game (and guess what, you're not alone down there!), a game where you are located on a boat and you quickly have to shoot all the dinosaurs flying and swimming toward you (think Star Fox), another game where you are riding on the back of a truck and you have to keep two rhino-dinosaurs (as I like to call them) from hitting your vehicle, and plenty of other games.  I don't want to give too much away.  Just don't expect the game to stay the same the whole way.  The second half of the adventure is much different.  You really should pick up this wonderful (and addicting!) action game. I love Dino Crisis 2.  It was a great change from the first one, and it's a lost classic Playstation game that everyone should play.	1
Okay, here's the gist of things.  EQ finally got to a point where it was almost bug free.......then out comes ROK.  They still run patch after patch trying to fix little problems, and graphics glitches....and then they come out with yet ANOTHER expansion?  Don't we get the picture yet?  It's not about quality of gameplay, people.........it's about the bottom line.  I could go into a 5 page dissertation on why I despise Verant and their company, and why the majority of people who are looking for a good gameplaying experience will walk away shaking their heads sadly....at the potential wasted, but I digress.  Fix the car before doing a brand new paint job.  Otherwise, you have something that LOOKS real great.......but goes nowhere.	-1
After playing the first Dino Crisis, I was very anxious and eager to try out it's sequal, Dino Crisis 2.  I was hoping for the best, that this would be the rare game that is better then it's forebearer, and I am pleased to say that the sequal blows the first one right out of the dino-infested jungle.   First off, this is not a survival horror game.  Within five minnutes of picking up the controler, its obvious that this is flat out an action adventure game, just with Resident Evil style controls.  In this game, it's kill or be killed, with no tranquelizers, only lots of high powered death dealing weaponry to extinguish the reptilian menace.  In the first game, you had to carefully manage each and every shell or bullet in your arsenal, and you also had to mix and manage tranquelizers in case you ran out of "Hard" amunition.  In this game however, bullets are plentiful, and tranquelizers are nowhere to be found.  If you want to tranquiize dinosaurs, you are not playing the right game!  Instead of a pistol, shotgun, and grenade gun, you get a pistol, a shotgun, a solid cannon, a heavy machine gun, missile pods, aquatic grenade launchers, flame throwers, dual handed submachine guns, etc, etc.  Even the lowly handgun will kill the early dino's in just a few hits.  All of these weapons are lots of fun to play around with, and some of the more powerful weapons will kill anything (except for the two big baddies) in 2 to three shots!   As you can probably guess, you'll come across some dinosaurs in the game, and there are many of them.  While facing off with one raptor last time was a pain in the butt, try facing off against three at one time!  And lets not even talk about the nasty oviraptors!  The dinosaurs in this game pop out of every single bush you'll come across, and they are fast, nasty and mean.  Luckily, the odds are even with all the death dealing weaponry you can get your hands on, but even with that, don't expect a walk in the park.  Some of these nasties can kill you in a few bone crushing bites if you are not careful.  Before we go any further, yes the T-Rex is in the game, and yes there is a dinosaur larger then the T-Rex, and yes it's spectacular to fight it.   Instead of a single large building to fight in, you get to fight in cretatious era jungles, a floating power plant, and in an interesting change of scenery, an underwater power-station.  This is definitly an interesting change in scenery, and makes for a more refreshing gameplay experience.  While an action adventure game with lots of guns and running around sounds bad with a resident evil control scheme, it actually works and is pretty easy to work.  If you want, you can also use the digital analog controler, but with fixed camera angles, I found it better to use the actual directional buttons.   Along with all the new weapons, the new dinosaurs, and new scenery, there is also a pretty decent story to go along with everything.  The government (The game dosent say which one) has greedily taken over Dr. Kirk's Third Energy research and of course, caused a huge problem (Bet you didint see that coming!).  An entire town has vanished, leaving in it's place a jungle.  So a elite military team goes...uhh...forward in the future to rescue everyone.  However, things go bad, and now only three people are left to save everyone.  The story exists purely to give a reason for all the killing, and it does a fairly coherient job at doing it.  You assume the identity of Regina, everybody's favorite secret agent from the last game, and newcomer Dylan, who has an interesting past, and a shocking future (It'll make sense when you see it).  One thing I was pleased with is that everybody is voiced by good voice actors, which makes listening to them an enjoyable experience.   One thing I absoloutly love about Dino Crisis 2 is that there are virtually no irritating puzzles to drive you insane!  No more DDK disks or switching circuts!  And the puzzles that are here revolve around action and are really simple "Do you want to disarm the missile, yes or no?".  Another interesting puzzle invovles trapping an irritating little dino that has a key you need.  Mini-games like these keep the game feeling fresh, and help spice up the game-play.  On another note, in the last game you could not skip cutscenes, which got really irritationg.  In this game however, you can skip cutscenes by pressing the select button.  Yippie!   Unlike the first game, there are some great rewards for finishing and re-playing the game.  If you collect enough dino files, you get a great bonus item (Which I'll let you find out for yourself).  There are also some very interesting mini-games, in which you don't have to worry about ammo, and focus on pure dino killin action!   However, there are some problems with the game.  The story is weak and could use a lot of work.  The time-travel element is completly wasted, and at times just does not make any sense whatsoever.  The story lacks a satisfying ending, and just stops in the ending cutscene.  While what happens afterwards is hinted at, it would have been very satisfying to actually see it.  The music is just that, music, with only one or two memorable tunes.  In addition, the game is a bit short.  It took me about eight hours to finish it the first time.   These are just small complaints however.  If you loved the first game, you'll love Dino Crisis 2.  Heck, if you like blasting dinosaurs to bits with lots of running and gunning, you'll probably enjoy this as well.  If you love blasting and shooting, you'll like this.  Highly recommended.	1
dino crisis2 is very good game and you can play two people at a time the dlyan regina the dirty place of game is research faciliy it is covered with plants and the whole place of research facility entrence is blocked for regina and place is almost scary. the t-rex is back still one thing is this the dino crisis1 is about dr.kirk and dino crisis 2 is about 3rd energy disk. the militray facility is to small for t-rex to enter the facility one bad news for you you came to rescue reseacrhers they where dead by dinos so the regina and dylan failed buy the game and enjoy it. is not also bad game and good grapics of dino crisis2 better grapics then dino crisis1.	1
As far as Im concerned this is way way better than the first Even though this is not a survival-horror (I don't see how it could be). This game would fit in the action/adventure. You get lotz of sweet weapons like the 9MM,Heavy Machine Gun,Shotgun,and the cool Rocket Launcher and(my personal favorite) the almighty Anti Tank Rifle. Ragina also gets a preety awesome missle pod. There are way more dinosaures than you can shake a leg at. On every screen there has to be atleast 2 dinos if not 3 or 4. There are about 20 dinos on here for every single dino on dino crisis 1. There are also lots of different dinos like the swimming thingers that live in the water,the Flying thingers, Ovi Raptors,Allasaures and of course the main dinos the Raptors. Even our old buddy the T-Rex is back and there is an even LARGER dino that the T-Rex fears. Every time you kill a dino you get points called extinct points that you can use to buy tools, gunns, ammo and recovery items. The replay value is great because after you beat the game you get the extra crisis mode where you get to buy dinos and battle them with a friend and every time you beat the game you get a new dino. There is also anouther mode you unlock called the dino colliseum. I recommend this game to everyone,though some of the horror-survival lovers will be a bit dissapointed...Buy it!!!!	1
We all thought that Resident Evil: Nemesis was really as good as it gets for the survival horror series, the pre-renders, the character detail, and even the CGs were beautiful. Dino Crisis 2 takes all of that and makes it better. As usual just like any survival horror game, DC2 uses the pre-rendered backgrounds instead of real-time environments. The pre-renders look just slightly better than any RE game out there, and improving upon pre-renders is a pretty tough task. The I haven't seen many CGs, but the intro CG isn't as clean as those found in Nemesis. Though when I first took a glance at Dino Crisis 2, I noticed that the character detail was significantly improved. The body structures are far smoother than any game out there right now, the hands, legs and the head are all jointed to the body seamlessly. There is absolutely no polygonal clipping, everything is smoothed out properly and Capcom gave the game that little extra to please gamers like me. Dino Crisis 2 also displays three to four dinosaurs on one screen with absolutely no slow-down. The visual detail in each dinosaur is extremely realistic, I have never seen enemies as detailed as those velociraptors or that incredibly huge one-eyed Tyrannosaurus Rex, folks mark my words these are the best visuals of all the survival horror games (excluding Code Veronica). Overall I am deeply impressed with the graphics that DC2 boasts, this is without a doubt one of the best looking PS games of the year. DC2 is survival horror but not exactly. What do I mean? Dino Crisis 2 takes the Resident Evil formula, throws it into the blender along with some new elements to create a game that feels like a whole new experience. Instead of the walking around picking up bullets, new guns and what ever, you now buy them! Yes buy them, but not exactly with money, you use your Extinction Points which are picked up by killing dinosaurs. Smaller dinos are worth anywhere from 100-600 points and at times more. The larger dinosaurs will grant you 2500+ points for your shopping needs. You buy equipment, med-kits, and back-up weapons from a computer like gismo which can be found slapped on walls. Accessing this little computer, will open up a menu that will ask you to Save or Shop. When you shop you can even upgrade your current weapon by adding more ammo to it by buying a new cartridge that can hold more bullets or flame power. If you are running low on ammo then you can also stop by one of the computerized shops to charge your weapon back to full power. Another new feature added in Dino Crisis 2 is the Combo System. The Combo System works like this; when you kill a dinosaur and then kill another one while the point score number is still showing then you will get a combo for that. If you have multiple enemies on the screen then use something that will hit at least two enemies at once, or just try to kill enemies as fast as possible. Every time you enter a new door your statistics and final score will show for what you had for that particular area, and if you are skilled enough and don't get harmed once you can earn an extra 2000 points.   Dino Crisis 2 starts out with what may be the best intro video that a game has seen, I won't get into it, I want to leave that for you to see. You start out as Regina and Dylan, the two main characters of the game. They arrive at the jungle via time-machine only to find out that the amount of dinos that inhabit in their is far too much for the troops to take care of. After some awesome sequences, the game sets you up as Dylan, a T.R.A.T trooper who is equipped with a blade that can be used for slashing away vines that have grown on a locked door. Dylan's main weapon is a shotgun with 200 bullets of ammo. As you walk around the game will waste no time throwing velociraptors at you, they will surround you so you better use the R2 button [to do a 180 degree spin] effectively. After Regina will take over because of an emergency that happens just a few minutes after you pick up the control of Dylan. She is equipped with a Handgun and a Stun Gun that can be used to zap electronically locked doors so they would open. A map is another inclusion that can be used to our advantage, blue marks mean open doors, red marks mean closed doors and an "S" stands for a shop. The map will pin-point your location and really help you out throughout the game, this is a very useful feature. Dino Crisis 2 can only be described as the best survival horror game that Capcom or any other company has made, and yes that is including Resident Evil: Code Veronica, it's that good!   The voice acting between RE1 and RE2 was a dramatic leap in both timing and quality, and the same can be said for Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2. The voice acting is superb, with excellent quality, voice comprehension and best of all near perfect timing. The screaming of the dinosaurs is the one thing that makes the sound such a killer (sorry about the pun), the T-Rex will scream so loud that it will actually move you backward. Background music also accompanies you when you are battling of dinosaurs, and best of all you can hear the dinos in the bushes as they are trying to attack you.   Controlling your characters is exactly like Resident Evil games. Nothing can be really said about the control except that you can side-step and do a few new things. This game is awesome, it is highly recommended in every department 9.6 / 10	1
I wasn't really too sure about buying this game, but I thought since all Capcom games are golden, this would be too. . .I was wrong. This is NOTHING like the first one. For instance: There aren't any scary moments that have you changing your underwear. And there's WAY to much ammo and guns that you can buy thanks to those stupid "points" after killing dinos. There's really no challenge in this game. POINTLESS compared to Resident Evil where you have to save every bullet to kill the zombies. In this game you just run around shooting dinos that always re-apear seconds after there dead. The voice acting is decent, and there's plenty of scencs that keep the story moving, even if the story doesnt make too much sence. The CG movies are awesome, especially the intro. But thats about it. Not the best Capcom has done.	-1
I am going to write a short but correct Review. if you don't have the Everquest game you can't play this one, so your better off getting the Everquest and trying it out (you can't play this version for a while).  If you have everquest, and you like the game get this expansion it is more places to advance to when you get level 35 or such. If you hate Everquest, don't get this game it is not that special, more of the same.	1
EverQuest is a hugely popular multi-user online role playing game, where players buy the base software and then pay a monthly fee to connect to the server. The server holds the worlds that the players explore 24 hours a day - a world populated by computer-controlled people (NPCs, or non-player characters), by monsters, and by many, many other gamers. It is in many way a role-player's dream come true. Where Ultima Online uses a top-down, isometric view a la Baldur's Gate, EverQuest goes for the in-your-face style of Doom or Thief. You can rotate through to other views, but the character-point-of-view seems to work best, truly immersing yourself in your world. You begin by choosing a server to play on - each server hosts a set of characters, quests, and NPCs. A given CD can allow up to 8 characters on each server. If you don't like a character, you can immediately delete it and make a new one - a nice feature compared to some of the other gaming systems that make you wait a week or more. On the downside, your new character only starts with a weapon and some food. The other gaming systems start you with a good amount of cash, which is why they don't let you simply cycle through characters in an attempt to build up wealth. With the characters being polygon-based, they have done a nice job of allowing different facial features on the characters. You can choose from a wide variety of races. The traditional human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, etc. are here, but they throw in a lizard race, ogres, trolls, and intelligent black "erudites". On the downside, only the erudite is of color - everyone else is a "tan" with fixed hair and body. With Ultima Online, you can fully customize your hair color, length, and style, and skin color. Classes (or professions) are done in the D&D-2 style instead of the new edition. This means that choosing a certain race limits which classes are available to you. The typical classes of paladin, warrior, wizard, ranger, etc. are available. You can choose from being an axe-wielding dwarf, a elven bowman, a human wizard, or many other combinations. You then customize your various statistics - strenght, charisma, intelligence, etc. to finalize your character. There can only be one character of a given name in each world, which cuts down greatly on confusion between characters. Where some other gaming systems might have ten "Bilbos" running around, some good and some bad, in EverQuest you are the only character of your name in your server. You start out in a city that promotes your race and profession. You can talk to the guild leader there, get some initial training for free, and maybe hear about a quest or two. You can start talking to other characters that roam the city, finding where the best lairs of monsters are, or perhaps of other interesting goings-on. Once you practice moving about in the city, it's time to head out into the Real World. The world of EverQuest is *huge*, and as in most of these on line servers, it can literally take hours to walk across the continents. With the frontal view of EverQuest, you walk amongst the trees, past the shrubs, and see the monsters fly and wander right past you, scaled appropriately to size. The small snakes slither underfoot, while bats fly past your head and larger beasts tower over you. This is one area where EverQuest clearly shines - the immersive quality of exploration is fantastic. You have to learn 'sense heading' as you go. Each time you use any skill, be it swimming, fishing, clothes making, direction finding or fighting, you gain experience and knowledge in that skill. After killing a few of the vermin of the forest, you gain items and money, which you can trade in for better weapons, armors or spells, and on you go. The beauty of the system is that it is open-ended, and that there are always players to interact with, no matter what your schedule is. If you work third shift or are an early riser, there are players there. If you're a night owl or have a few hours free in the afternoon, there those players are. You can leave your character when you're done, and when you return, your character will be exactly as you left it. The world around you, however, will NOT be - it has been growing and changing in the hours you were away! It's an incredibly dynamic system, constantly changing, with real life people interacting with it. The ability to learn trade skills (like fishing, or cooking, or clothes making) greatly helps you become 'self supportive' and even create things for other characters. The inventory system has its good and bad points. The graphics are great, letting you see large, 3-dimensional images of the swords, backpacks, spell books, and other items. They are easy to keep track of and use, compared to other on line systems. On the downside, you can only carry 8 types of objects other than what you are wearing. If you get a backpack or sack you can increase this amount, but that is a bit limiting in the beginning. Highly recommended because of the large number of roleplayers that help populate this world, and because of the high quality first-person graphics. Downsides include the integrated player-vs-player combat, where other systems keep pvp in its own 'area' so those who do not wish to fight players do not have to. Another downside is lack of detailed customization of a character's appearance.	1
This is one of my fav games! Its much better than the first dino crisis and has more and better guns and dinos. One thing i like is you kill dinos and get points and you use points to buy new weapons/upgrades and to refill your ammo/ammo upgrades (hold more ammo)Its graphics are good. It has a cool mini game after you beat it where you pick who you want to be and your in this battle arena and theres dif stages with the different dinos untill you get to the final one with the big t-rex. This game is great and you should buy it!	1
Dino crisis was an excellent game, but dino crisis 2 blew it out of the water. In this game you are able to battle more dinos, with more weapons, and in more environments. this game also includes a buying system, similar to that of Blue Stinger. It takes it to a whole new level.	1
AS A BIG FAN OF '' RESIDENT EVIL '' AND '' DINOCRISIS '' I WAS PATIENTLY ANTICIPATING THIS GAME'S RELEASE !! AND WAS I KNOCKED OFF MY SEAT PLAYING THIS GAME !!  '' DINOCRISIS '' WAS A COOL GAME , BUT TOO MANY PUZZLES ; AND NOT A WIDE VARIETY OF DINOSAURS TO SLAY. BUT WITH THE NEW GAME - YOU NEVER GET BORED ONE BIT ! UNLESS YOU GET LOST ..  TONS OF DINOS TO BLOW INTO EXTINCTION , AND THE POINT SYSTEM IS GREAT! KILL LOTS OF NASTY DINOS AND GET POINTS ! WHAT A CONCEPT MAN !! SHEER GENIUS ! AND THE MINI FIGHTING GAMES ARE COOL - IF YOU BUY ALL THE CHARACTERS.. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY FIGHT TOO SLOW. BUT ALL THE MINI GAMES RULE !! TRY SHOOTING AT A CHARGING TRICERATOPS , MOSOSAURS UNDERWATER , A GROUP OF '' ALLOSAURS '' AND TREX AND PALS. PLAY IT !!! YOU WON'T BE LETDOWN ONE BIT !! WAIT TILL THE THIRD ONE IS OUT FOR PS 2 !!! RENT IT , BORROW IT , OR BUY IT !!!!  BEST THING YOU'LL EVER PLAY !!!	1
I expected this game to really rule. I thought to myself, "Tens of thousands of players rpging together? It will be chaos! People will be banding into nations and battling each other for dominion! Imagine my disappointment when I found that pking is not only disallowed(or restricted), in most servers, most players I talked to professed DISGUST at player killers! Worse, guards are now near invulnerable. What? Can't a guy have a little fun and slip a 6-inch dagger between a guard's plates and into his back? It's only an AI. I pray for the day that someone with a sense of fun (dreary drugdgery, which is what this game is starting to feel like after four months) takes over this company and point this world into the right direction.	-1
This game is simply awesome. At the start,it may seem complicated and hard. But its fun more than makes up for that. Spend enough time,and you'll find great strategies. Like when I was around the third area,Manda Island,I found a technique to raise power,increase health,and make some good secondary weapons. And this game isn't violent at all. I recommend Mega Man Legends 2 to ANYONE who wants fun,or a good challenge.	1
I bought this game the day it came out. I waited years for it! If you've played MegaMan Legends(1), you'd understand why.  The game itself has a many new things, as well as a many things from the first game.  The game control is still the same, and the look is also basically the same, so are most of the weapons.  But your lock-on is a bit easier, and the plot definatly takes a bigger leap.  The levels are also more challenging, with better weapon management.  Of course, you can't forget the new people, both townspeople and villians! You'll find out all about the Reaverbots, Mother Lode, as well as the secret behind MegaMan's shrouded past...  The comical Bonnes return (humorous as ever), as well as Glyde, and they also gave Bon his original Pikachu voice back (if you've played Misadventures Of Tron Bonne, you'll be thankful for this)! Total Game Time normally takes about 16 to 18 hours to complete (that is, if you're doing your best and trying to obtain most items). Weapon attachments include Homing Missile, Spread Buster, Drill Arm, and many more. The game now features underwater adventures! Strap on the new Hydro Jets, and make diving fun and easy! Not just one island! Now you can travel to Calinca (it SHOULD be spelled Kalinka), Nino, and Manda islands, as well as many more! In all, I found the game a real treat.  While maybe not too on the fast-paced action/exciting side, it certainly is a must to those of you who wish to see how the mystery unfolds...  I have few complaints, aside wishing the Bonnes played a bigger role, and seeing the original voice actors for MegaMan (as well as some better, more acurate translations, which was my main quelm), but seriously, it is still understandable if you missed out on MegaMan Legends 1, but I would advise trying the first one first.  That way, you won't be completely lost, and it will make the sequel so much more enjoyable!  Be safe!	1
I'm a huge fan of Capcom's Megaman francises and I played almost every Megaman game ever made. Megaman Legends 2 is an excellent sequel to the most anticipated Megaman Legends. This game has an extended storyline, beatiful 3D graphics, and slick control. This is one of the best Megaman titles out there, but still....why PlayStation ? This game is not bad, but somehow it didn't make it to the other console systems like Sega Dreamcast, PC CD-ROM, or the Nintendo 64. Some gaming websites that I stumbled accros from, said that among Nintendo Gamecube's lineup, there will be a Megaman title ! Could it be Megaman Legends 2, Megaman X5, or is it another Megaman title that's gonna be created only for Gamecube ? Ah well ! Only time will tell whem Megaman Legends 2 will be ported over to another system. Just imagine....Megaman Legends 2 on the Dreamcast ! Oops ! I forgot to mention something ! Unlike some of the Megaman games, this game has a handful of fast-paced mini games and unlimited 3D enviroments. Although this is pure perfection over the first Megaman Legends, this game still suffers polygonal glitches because of the PlayStation's outdated 32-bit processor. If you're in the store and you're looking for the pefect Megaman game to add to your PlayStation library, Megaman Legends 2 is for you ! Reminder to all Megaman fans: PC OWNERS WILL LOOK FORWARD TO MEGAMAN LEGENDS FOR PC ! GAMEBOY OWNERS WILL LOOK FORWARD TO MEGAMAN XTREME FOR GAMEBOY COLOR ! PLAYSTATION OWNERS WILL LOOK FORWARD TO MEGAMAN X5 FOR THE PLAYSTATION ! NINTENDO 64 OWNERS WILL LOOK FORWARD TO MEGAMAN 64 FOR THE NINTENDO 64 ! FUTURE GAMEBOY ADVANCED OWNERS WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO MEGAMAN'S FIRST RPG, MEGAMAN EXE ! That's all !	1
I love this game. I played it when I was much younger. Already being a huge Mega Man fan, it solidified its place in my video game collection.	1
This , of course, is the sequel to my favorite PS game Legends, and it has the same feel. It has different combat and weapons but more the same.	1
I originally wanted to wait until I completed Mega Man Legends 2 to review it, but seeing as how the game is *really* long I think it would be better to review it now while the game is fresh in my mind.  If you happened to come across my review for the original Mega Man Legends, you'd know exactly what I thought about the move from 2D to 3D- it was a complete success for Mega Man.  Simply put, Mega Man Legends was a great game.  Sure, there were issues with the way Capcom chose to go about making the control system (not everyone likes using the L1 and R1 buttons to rotate the direction Mega Man is facing, for example) but when it came down to it, people eventually learned how to control the game, and at the end of the day Mega Man fans were satisfied with the way the controls were designed because they *worked*.  Maybe there could have been a better way to control Mega Man, maybe not.  The controls in this game are the same exact way.  Mega Man Legends 2 was released in 2000, which incidentally was getting *very* close to the end of the original Playstation's life.  In 2000, the Playstation 2 was on the market and its popularity was growing rapidly, day by day.  With all sorts of impressive graphics and storylines dominating the Playstation 2, the original Playstation was quickly fading away.  However, just because the Playstation 2 was the hot new gaming console at the time didn't mean it was automatically "game over" for Sony's previous console.  A few interesting games were still waiting to be released for the original Playstation.  Such as a sequel to Mega Man Legends.  And impressive it is!  The graphics, music and controls have been updated and now Mega Man looks, sounds and plays *much* better.  In fact, after playing through this game you might think to yourself that the previous Mega Man Legends game was just a work in progress, leading up to the REAL thing.  The real thing being Mega Man Legends 2.  When you arrive to the very first town in Mega Man Legends 2, you will leave the flutter and take a look at the town.  Snow is falling, and the town is quiet and beautiful.  A perfect winter snowfall.  You will notice that the graphics are really something phenomenal.  In the previous game the scenery NEVER looked this good.  Everything was rather clunky and ugly-looking, like a land of colorful legos.  The complete opposite in Mega Man Legends 2.  If you want to see a perfect example of what the original Playstation's graphical power was capable of, check out this game.  It never got any better, in my opinion.  Okay, maybe Silent Hill and Final Fantasy 7 featured better graphics, but Mega Man Legends 2 comes in third, no doubt about it.  In addition to the graphics being a significant improvement over the original, the music is pretty amazing, too.  Now the music is more suitable for the environment you're in.  In fact, because the storyline in the game has been taken to a much bigger and interesting level, you can almost say the music in Mega Man Legends 2 is borderline RPG music.  Seriously, it's not much different from what you'd hear in a Final Fantasy game.  The music in Mega Man Legends 2 gives the game a more majestic and serious feel, which again, isn't at ALL like the previous Mega Man Legends game.  In that game the music was very much like typical, frantic (not to mention, sometimes irritating) Mega Man music.  This time around, the themes in each place you explore are more relaxing and closer to standard RPG music.  On a personal note, I find myself humming more themes in this game than in the other one.  The greatest thing that stands out about Mega Man Legends 2 is all the creativity that went into each of the worlds you explore.  A Mega Man game should have a variety of environments, and it's safe to say this game delivers with that.  You will explore jungle, snow, ice, underwater and fire worlds.  Yes, you actually explore underwater places in this game, and the fire world is simply delightful to watch (not to mention dangerous if you don't have the right armor equipped!)  Where was all this creativity in the original Legends?  It wasn't there!  By the way, just so you know, each of these worlds will take place on a different island.  In the beginning of the game, you have to fight a giant tank that takes place in the middle of a snowstorm.  It's more fun than it sounds, believe me.  For those of you who grew up with the Playstation 1 (like me) Mega Man Legends 2 will AMAZE you with all the extra work that went into the graphics.  Believe me, no graphics THIS good could be found in the original Mega Man Legends.  Oh, I forgot to mention it, but you explore these jungle, water, and fire worlds by way of a map.  Don't worry, the map is a piece of cake to use because you only have to explore six or seven islands.  Of course, these are six or seven BIG islands, filled with interesting, dangerous enemies!  To travel to another island, all you have to do is enter the flutter, talk to Roll, click on the "Move" option, and a map will appear.  Simply move the flutter to the island you'd like to explore, and you're there!  Remember in the original Mega Man Legends how each of the Sub-Gate worlds could be completed by simply jumping over the stage enemies, and jet skating to the end boss?  Good luck blowing through the stages the same way in THIS game.  Because each island has its own unique environment, you will discover enemies that will correctly fit in with each of these environments.  For example, the jungle stage will have frogs jumping at you, and robotic fish are waiting for you in the underwater place.  MUCH more enemy variety in Mega Man Legends 2.  This was sorely needed in the original.  In the original, it was like you were walking through one medium-length ice cube factory after another.  Despite what some people may say, Mega Man Legends 2 is MUCH bigger than the previous game.  Capcom delivers with a bigger and better storyline, not to mention twice as many cutscenes (which you can choose to skip over if you wish).  All your favorite characters from the original return such as Roll, Data the Monkey, Teisel and Tron.  You will also discover what Roll thinks about Tron, which is an interesting thing I was curious about after playing through the original a dozen times or so.  Can't forget about those pesky yellow pirates, either!  They're back and more annoyingly fun than ever!  Just the fact that so much thought and energy went into the storyline means you have to respect all the work the creators had to do.  That's not to say the game is dominated with storyline segments.  You also have a LOT of action-packed stages to explore, each one quite lengthy (as mentioned above).  Don't be fooled into thinking more time was devoted to storyline and less time devoted to action.  That's definitely not the case.  You have TWICE as many boss fights to deal with this time around and some of them are really spectacular-looking and require a certain strategy to defeat effectively.  Sometimes you have to fight two or three bosses in a row before another save point arrives.  I can't believe how many bosses are LOADED in this game.  I'd say the challenge went up a couple notches as well because, later in the game, not having the right weapon or the right equipment with you is guaranteed to give you trouble.  Always buy upgrades at the junk shops whenever you can.  By the way, there's now a junk shop on practically every island you explore, unlike the previous game where you had to keep going back to the same shop.  You also have an option in the beginning of the game to learn the controls.  It's a place to practice the controls that your female friend Roll will guide you through.  She'll help you in every way imaginable.  It's a really good idea to play through this practice stage before starting up the actual game (unless you already know the controls well enough from the previous game, then by all means, skip this part).  They added something new to this game- the ability to lift up blocks and throw them.  This is important to learn because later in the game you will need to stack blocks to climb to higher places.  It's really easy to use them- simply stand next to one and hit the triangle button to lift it, and then triangle again to release it.  It's important to learn this because later in the game you have to lift up enemies and throw them at other enemies.  Trust me, it's not hard.  My record beating the original Mega Man Legends was under 2 hours and 20 minutes.  It will be a miracle if I'm able to complete THIS game in under six hours.  It's hard to believe *so much* could be added to a single disc, but it's true.  The fact that the final boss in the game requires you to use a LOT more energy canteens than in the original Legends means the challenge is definitely a few notches higher.  With a bigger story, lengthier and more interesting worlds, better graphics and music, you must buy Mega Man Legends 2 if the original was your cup of tea.	1
The first Legends game was pretty good, but this one improves on everything, ten-fold! The graphics and animations are smoother, controls have been made more accurate and it's just an overall better game. I like all they actually tried to make sense of the story (something that dosen't happen to much with capcom games) and all the references to past games. To put it simply, this game is great and no Mega Man fan should be without it.	1
Correct me if im worng but MML1 recieved controversial hysteria from those few who knew about it, it was dissed and trashed for not following the 2d blue bombers previous exploits, but when i playerd it, i loved it even though i had played MM's previous Gameboy,Playstation and NES games, and i was not dissapointed by MML1 (megaman legends 1) at all, it was pretty large and the fact that you could make weapons from scrap parts found in ruins was icing on the glorious 3d cake. and so when megaman legends 2 hit shelves i ahd to check it out, i will say this now, Play megaman legends 1 first if you can since A. its incredibly great and B. you cant really understand this whole thing if you haven't played and beaten 1, though its not required. but in MML2 the blue bomber is back in all his plated glory, this time the gorup continues their search for the motherlode on a strange icy tundra island, once there you fight hordes of Reaverbots and eventually meet a mysterious young lady, this all takes place after the wicked opening cut-scene which is sure to please all. i won't go too deep into the story since its pretty hard to understand even if you ahve played the game. but Megamans little friend Data (a dancing monkey creature) is back to give you advice,Save your game and refill your health and special weapona ammo,all of which you'll need for the vicous boss fights, but more on that later. then theres Roll who is megamans best friends (and love ineterest?). she is a mechanical genius and flies the flutter and makes special wepaons out of worthless junk you find in ruins (more on these later too). she is on a quest to retrieve the motherload and find her long lost (apparebntly dead) parents. and megeaman is the brave and willing digger (people who search ruins for treasure) who's role goes much deeper than nyone would've expected. then theres the countless pirates who you basically need to play 1 to understand at all (they're back, the bonnes i mean) they are also joined by a new pirate friend, Glyde and his caste of Birdbots and then theres Klaymoore and Bola somne f the coolest badguys ever, Klaymoors big and mechanical with lots of guns while Bola is sleek and fast with a cool sword and pincer arm. they sonstantly try to thwart megaman on his digger quests. now on to the ruins and world etc. this world is double the size of MML1 which is a godsend for those who didn't want the first one to end (me being one of them), there are many islands to explore now each full of a city, mini quests and games and lots of ruins where you scrounge up junk for Roll to make into special weapons which can devestate just about anything later on, this adds a huge bit of exploration to the game. bosses are huge and hard, alot of them are huge reaverbots and pirates in this game with multiple strategies and attack patterns making them difficult but not overly so, these bosses are numbering far above the teens in number so don't expect to see a shortage of these fun and sometimes hilarious bosses who stay on a good path of hard but not frustratingly tedious. and the graphics are very niucely done for a playstation game, they are very anime-ish with the occasioanl Jaggy and megaman looks cool, so does Roll and the rest of the cast (my favorite characetr is Bomb Bonne though, HEH =P), the towns and cities are nicely rendered but the ruins sometimes look very similiar and hallways are almost always alike. these ruins are also too few in number and the ones you HAVE to explore (involved in the main quest) are sometimes too large and long to cope with particularly Ninos ruin which is very tedious and takes like 30 minutes to beat, all in all however this game is great for anyone who is a fan of the blue bomber and great for first timers alike, in one word, think of Zelda, thats the best way to describe this game, Zelda for the PSX.	1
While this game isn't very expansive and doesn't directly tie into the Mega Man timeline, it still contains the quality that Capcom has always given its games! I'm sure there's a way to link it to the other series timeline though. Maybe there's something Capcom hasn't told us yet. Still, they managed to take a spinoff and turn it into a full fledged series! First off, the ruin designs are excellent - maybe even better than the 1st game's - but not likely. A couple of the key mazes in this game involve backtracking to the same place well more than once, which can get tedious, especially when the area is filled with water or the gravity is heavy or whatnot, and it slows you down. Other than that, the mazes are flawless! There is a slight problem with the battles though, and I'm sure those of you that have played the game have seen it - the 'Ultimate Technique' of locking onto the prime target and blasting away while running in a constant circle. It makes many battles way too easy. The graphics have been improved from the last game. The models have higher polygons counts and much better coloration (something the last gamewas really lacking). The music is much better too, and not quite as downright corny as the 1st game. The plot goes into more depth, too.  It's very slightly on the darker and more serious side, and the characters are cooler too (Sera is the most unusual villain I've ever seen, but she's devoid of any and all emotion, and definitely the perfect villain for this story. What makes it better is that you don't see it in her until it's too late). The plot explains more of Mega Man Trigger's origins and even the reason why he's on the planet - I won't reveal that though). The game definitely has its lighthearted moments. The Bonnes are still there, which is a definite plus! There are some new pirates too. All things said (and I could ramble on longer about how much I like this game), the game is definitely worth getting if you're either a Mega Man fan, or if you played the first game and then left in the dark on what the hell was going on. It gives plenty of opportunities for free exploration, and you always find something the second time around you missed the first time (whether it's in a town or a ruin, I gurantee there's gonna be something new to see).	1
This game has improved since the first one. The graphics are better, the story is, and so is the action. You'll learn more about this new Mega Man. The only bad thing is I was left wanting more.	1
Cannon Spike isn't about building up your characters, there's no five minute summons here, no collecting 100 pieces of fruit/coins/whatever, none of these characters are called Ryo Hazuki or Lara Croft, this isn't a sports game, and all your GameFAQS in the world can't help newbie gamers for what Cannon Spike is--old-school gaming madness. It is unbelievably refreshing to play a game that harkens back to the days BEFORE PSX, where the only thing that mattered was skill, not graphics (memories...*sigh*). Yeah, that's right, SKILL. S-K-I-L-L, skill. Cannon Spike is an absolute twitchfest. You're gonna need three things when playing this game: skill, reflexes and lots of skilled reflexes. This ain't Metal Gear Sorry, thank you very much, this is a game that requires actual skill, something that is lost in many of today's games (or--in the case of Game Shark users, continue button mashers and EGM--today's "gamers"). But I'm a jaded gamer, and I'm gonna rant about the flaws first. My biggest complaint would be the music. Yes, this hard-core gamer doesn't really care for game music (WHY should I? I listen to real music [Nine Inch Nails], thank you very much). That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions though (Final Fantasy IX, anyone?); but this just isn't one of them--the "music" is extremely forgettable (the one thing Capcom has yet to do right: music). And my next complaint would be...uh, wait a second...other than the music, there ISN'T anything wrong with the game! Yes, I said it before, and I'll say it again, this game is amazing. There seems to be some complaining about the game's length though (the previous reviewer would be one). Yeah, 15 minutes is all it takes to beat the game. BUT, isn't a great action game like Super Contra, Smash TV and Robotron about playing it until your eyes start twitching (like mine usually do--ugh, my poor vision...)? Yes, it is. And in Cannon Spike's defense, I honestly don't think it would have improved if it was hours long (does anyone remember Loaded? Extremely fun at first, but then gets monotonous after a few hours). I know what you're wondering, exactly what is Cannon Spike (other than amazing, of course)? It's a shooter...sort of. Cannon Spike is basically Robotron with Capcom characters and beautiful graphics. I guess, if anything, you could put this in the shooter genre. You're gonna do tons of shooting, and you're gonna be shot at more times than you would if you lived in L.A. And like most shooters, this game is pretty hard (not Gunbird 2 hard though...thank god). Sure, it's easy if you put the difficulty on easy and slap the start button unmercifully when it says continue (wuss), but even on the normal setting things are far from a walk in the park. Bosses practically fill the screen, bullets are shot at you every inch you move, and they all have a way of ganging up on you like you wouldn't believe. But at the same time, this game also has a slight Streets of Rage/Final Fight feel to it (not surprising, seeing as how Capcom was responsible for Final Fight and Cannon Spike). The game is, after all, fully 3D, and you can also punch the enemies. And that leads me to the next subject: control. You have six buttons to use; those being fire, attack, heavy shot, heavy attack, mark (it lets you shoot at one specific enemy), and special attack. The control is tight, it's precise, and I never had a problem with it. And what's a game with its heroes, you say? Relax, Capcom characters are here to save the day. Arthur of Ghoul 'N Ghosts fame (not that I'm complaining, but, uh, why did they change him?), Mega Man of Mega Man fame, Cammy and Charlie of Street Fighter fame, and B.B. Hood of Vampire Savior fame. There's also two completely new characters in the game, skateboarder Shiba Shintaro and half-cyborg, all samurai, Simone. I'll be honest...the two new characters didn't do much for me (I would have liked to see Jill Valentine in here rather than those two), but they are a nice welcome (and a challenge to play with) nonetheless. And, thankfully, all the characters have different moves, different advantages and disadvantages, and different endings. You're gonna see some other Capcom references in here, too. Most notably the dogs from Resident Evil and a futuristic goth (wha!?! A goth in a video game!? About time!) version of Balrog (that's Vega to us). Capcom and Psikyo brought us a shooter/beat 'em up (or, as I call them, shmups) that's not only amazing, not only a joy to play, and not only one of the best games of the year, but is an absolutely must-own masterpiece (and, it's for ... too, how can you beat that?). As for you continue button mashers and Game Shark users, I'd like to think Capcom and their new buddies Psikyo didn't make Cannon Spike for you...but you should buy it anyway. So grab something to drink, grab a friend (Wha!?! A two-player game that isn't a fighter or a sports game!? I must be dreaming...), plug in, and lose yourself into the classic old-school gaming madness that is Cannon Spike. Besides, what are you gonna buy, the new Tomb Raider? *shudder*	1
In the modern day of 40+ hour RPG quests and multiple-input-command 3D fighting games, it's a rare thing to see a new release game that tests reflexes while being FUN.  Thank you, Capcom, for Cannon Spike.  This game reminds me of the old arcade shooter days, playing Galaga and Gyruss for hours just to get a higher score.  Unlike your Resident Evils or Final Fantasies, there's not much of a story here.  Robots invade, must kill robots.  The shooting begins.  You control a character (several are from Capcom classics, like Arthur from Ghosts N Goblins) who zips around the screen laying waste to anything that moves.  You fight a sub-boss, then move to another part of the stage, then fight a Real Boss, using various weapons and spectacular power-ups (Mega Man rolls around the screen, damaging anything he touches) to save the day.  The graphics are definitely modern, from the nice character animation to the convincing explosions and gorgeous arenas (in The Slope you run circles around a robot skier as you both careen down an icy mountain).  The two-player mode can be used as a co-op effort or a mad competition for points and health power-ups.  Completing the game opens a cool Capcom art gallery with conceptual sketches and other Cannon Spike stuff.  Gamers used to 3D action-adventures won't find a lot to satisfy them here, but to me, there's nothing like taking a break from Soul Reaver or Code: Veronica to blow the heck out of robots with names like Bio Gorilla Bloody or Flying Saucer Kabuki.  Length and depth take a back seat to old-fashioned fun with Cannon Spike, and I find it to be a refreshing change.	1
I think I've tried them all, and this is my favorite combat flight simulator that portrays aircraft of the WWII era.  It has outstanding graphics, and the flight characteristics of the individual aircraft are modeled realistically within the necessary constraints of the game.  It is meant to be fun, after all.  I like Navy fighter planes (the F4F, F6F and F4U)with their big radial engines.  They are not available in this game, which is based in Europe and features the U.S. Army Air Corps, the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force.  Nevertheless, for graphics and just plain flying fun, this game is hard to beat.  In this one, you can fly the P-51, P-47, P-38, Spit, Bf-109, or FW-190.  You can also check out their cockpits and specs, get some history of that ancient conflict (can it actually have been 60 years ago?  Seems like yesterday!).  Jane's has long been the definitive source for information on planes, ships and armaments.  It is appropriate that the best combat sim around has their name on it.  I run an AMDK6-2 (350) CPU, Diamond Monster 3D II video accelerator, Flight Stick Pro with rudder pedals, and only 64 Mbs of RAM.  The game loaded and played well from the very beginning, though my setup is minimal by  most gamer's standards.  I have some experience with full-sized aircraft (I soloed in 1946) and radio-controlled models.  These games are fun!  When you get a little experience, there are even on-line combat flying games (Air Warrior is a good one) in which you can fly against real people.  This game, by Electronic Arts, and Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator II (Pacific Theater) are the tops in my opinion for entertainment and excitement, as well as top graphics and flight modeling.  Microsoft's game was a bit more picky getting it to run smoothly.  Graphics are comparable.  This game is my first choice.  Joseph Pierre, USN (Ret)	1
I was getting tired of Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3, (CFS3) I had already done just about everything you could do on it, and I was ready for a better flight sim. I have spent many hours on CFS3 and Microsoft Flight Simulator X. I wanted a WWII combat flight sim, so I spent a lot of time looking them up on the internet and on Amazon. Essentially, I found very little about any of the sims, except for these reviews, and finally decided that the only way to find out which one was the best was to buy all of them. I had a $25 Amazon gift card, plus some extra cash, so I began to buy all the combat flight sims I could find for a reasonable price. I have heard that Combat Flight Simulator 2 Pacific Series is great, but I could not find one within my price range. I now own: Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1 (Europe Series) 1998, Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3 (Battle For Europe) 2007, Janes WWII Fighters 1998, Janes Attack Squadron 2002, and IL-2 Sturmovik (1946) 2006 (which also includes IL-2 Forgotten Battles, Ace expansion pack, and Pacific Fighters) I own many more flight sims than this, but I have found that anything from 1997 or earlier is not even worth talking about because the graphics are so primitive. I have played all these and compared them for a long time, and I have compiled all their attributes into a Pros and Cons list below. If you take the time to read this, you will know what flight sim is right for you.  Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1 (CFS1) (Europe Series) 1998  This sim is based on the earlier portion of the war on the western front, which includes the Battle of Britain, and early operations in France. Flyable aircraft are very limited, but include the Hawker Hurricane, not usually modeled in old flight sims. Many great Battle of Britain planes are present, like the He-111, Do-17, Me-110, Ju-87, Ju-88, and American bombers like the B-25, B-24, and B-17, but these are all non-flyable. There are some unusual missions, like escaping France in a stolen Bf-109, shooting down a traitor in your squadron, and shooting a German generals car out from under the Eiffel Tower! The campaigns are some of the best Ive seen, The Battle of Britain is very engaging, protecting ship convoys from Stukas and U-boats. Rockets and explosions are realistic. CFS1 has pretty bad aircraft graphics, but the ground detail is amazing, taken from an actual satellite. However, this pales since the ground is completely flat except for spiky mountains, and a few badly modeled buildings in the cities. The satellite image also slows down my laptop. AI (Artificial Intelligence) is marginal, fighters attack but know hardly any maneuvers, and enemy bombers don't avoid you. The menu is reasonable, and pretty easy to use.  Pros: Fair Graphics, Fair selection of flyable aircraft, good AI, Fair menu.  Cons: Flat ground, bad aircraft graphics, not enough flyable aircraft, cant fly the P-38 NO MISSION BUILDER (Deal breaker)  What sets it apart: Cool campaigns and missions.  Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3 (CFS3) (Battle For Europe) 2007  This flight sim is based on the whole war on the western front, from the Battle of Britain to the Battle of the Ardennes, and on. Very unique array of aircraft, ALL are flyable! Planes like the B-25, B-26, Ju-88, and Mosquito are fully modeled, from the controllable gunner positions to the damage modeling. Unusual planes like the P-55 Ascender, and Go-229 flying wing are also flyable, though they would never fly in real life. There are many tanks, flak guns, and ship convoys. There is even an invasion fleet on campaigns on a certain day. Missions are reasonable and challenging, the campaigns are great, with maps, separate available missions, and customization of your own personal aircraft. Campaigns are very lengthy and difficult, however. CFS3 wins the prize for labeling: Aircraft, tanks, airbases, factories, refineries, and other objects are all labeled with their distance from you in feet. This, however, makes it somewhat more of an arcade game unless you turn it off. No mission builder, unless you load one for it off the internet, (Have a nice time figuring that out, they deleted the CFS3 website!) Graphics are good, some trees, many different buildings and airbases, relatively detailed ships, and smooth aircraft. Most of Britain, France and Germany are modeled, and even part of Spain and Switzerland. AI is not that great, enemy fighters sometimes ignore you, but have pretty good aim. They also crash by themselves too easily. Tanks have to stay in their formations, and almost never fire at all. The intro video is intense and extremely realistic, with the exception of the Go-229 at the end. The menu shows your customized aircraft and armament parked next to a hanger, which is cool. User interface is good. Menu music is depressing, which is probably intentional. Relatively realistic in all.  Pros: Good graphics, Great selection of Aircraft, Great factories and ship convoys, Good menu.  Cons: Arcade-like, fake-ish prototype aircraft, ditzy aircraft and vehicle AI, NO MISSION BUILDER.  What sets it apart: Flyable medium bombers with gunner positions, and unusual aircraft.  Janes WWII Fighters 1998  This sim is based on the last major German offensive in WWII. The speed and maneuverability of the fighters are slightly embellished towards the Axis aircraft, the German planes are given similar maneuverability to superior aircraft like the P-51, which makes for fair battles on either side. Flyable aircraft are limited to the Spitfire, P-51, P-47, P-38, Bf-109, Fw-190, and Me-262. Many Axis and Allied bombers like the B-17 are included, but they are non-flyable. There is a big selection of tanks, ground vehicles, buildings, and other objects on the mission builder, which is very easy to use. Massive tank battles can be created in just a few seconds by placing  tank divisions on the map. The V-1 Flying Bomb is also on the mission builder. There is also the ability to set an infinite combination of trigger points, which are invisible values, times, and conditions that can cause an action like making more planes appear, or anything else you can think of. The sim has pretty good graphics, though there are almost no trees and the ground is completely flat except for a few buildings and mountains. There is only a small area of land that is modeled, and no water or ships at all. AI is very good, even the best pilot can be shot down by a rookie fighter if hes not careful. Tanks dart away when shot at by planes, but just sit there when other tanks attack. The menu is very fun and easy to use, great user interface. The menu  music is catchy and true to the time period. In-flight music is somewhat annoying. You can learn a lot from the narrated documentaries on each aircraft. All in all pretty realistic, defiantly the best combat flight sim from the 90s.  Pros: Fair graphics, Great selection of ground vehicles, Great mission builder, Great AI, Awesome menu with elevator music, Awesome user interface  Cons: Graphics inferior to newer sims, not enough flyable aircraft, no water or ships, no trains, ditzy tank AI, aircraft AI always wants to fight you head on! (Be careful)  What sets it apart: Great AI, Great mission builder.  Janes Attack Squadron 2002  This sim is based on the bombing raids and air-to-ground attacks of the western front. All aircraft are flyable, including three heavy bombers, the B-17, B-24, and Avro Lancaster with their many bombardier and gunner positions! There are only a few different kinds of tanks, trains, and ships. The physics editor and mission builder appear to be the best ones yet, with waypoint markers, 1 million square miles of detailed terrain to work with, and even terrain sculpting! The only problem is that they are very complicated, and the help and read-me files are corrupted do to a programming error. The full mission builder and physics editor are unsupported by the company, and cannot be found anywhere. So much for the mission builder. There are only 6 pre-made missions, which are pretty good but boring after 12 times. The quick mission builder is good, with multiple aircraft, enemy aircraft, target, weather, and time settings, although you cannot select location or direction and are limited to 32 aircraft. With this you create awesome bombing missions, with formations of bombers attacking massive, detailed cities, with defending fighters swarming around. Terrain graphics are relatively good, but defiantly an improvement over Janes WWII fighters. Buildings are very detailed, from houses and hangers with individual windows, to massive factories and even small sky scrapers. Bomber details are pretty good, but fighters are kind of boxy with less curves. Damage modeling is great, bullet and flak holes appear when hit. The fighter AI is good, though not quite as good as WWII Fighters. The bomber AI, however, is superb. Bombers fly in close formation without ever crashing, (Imagine that!) and gunnery accuracy is better than any other flight sims bombers. Set to aces, a formation of 6 B-17s can shoot down a Bf-109 in less than 5 seconds! Ground vehicles, tanks, and ships have no AI whatsoever, and just go through their waypoints no matter what. The menu is very easy to use, and the menu music is not too annoying. The intro and in-flight music are cool.  Pros: Good graphics, Ability to fly all bombers, Great bomber AI, Good user interface.  Cons: Graphics inferior to newer sims, bad aircraft graphics, bad selection of ground vehicles, unusable/way-to-hard-to-use mission builder.  What sets it apart: Ability to fly the B-17, B-24, and Lancaster and control gunner positions.  Ubisoft IL-2 Sturmovik (1946) 2006  This sim includes all of the previous IL-2s made by Ubisoft before 2006, so any other ones like IL-2 Forgotten Battles and Pacific Fighters are not necessary. IL-2 1946 includes most of WWII on the Western front, the Pacific front, but focuses on the Eastern Russian front. The 1946 portion focuses on an alternate timeline in which all the major leaders like Roosevelt, Stalin, and Hitler have died and the new leaders send their countries into vastly different paths than those of reality. The war continues into 1946 where both Allies and Axis have advanced rocket and jet aircraft. Some U.S.S.R. aircraft are even as advanced as the MiG-15, some even more. German late-war prototype aircraft like the Go-229 have materialized and are used in combat. Even guided missile technology is available. I have to admit, that at first, I was a bit skeptical since IL-2 1946 was designed in Russia. It turns out that as I suspected, IL-2 is significantly embellished towards the U.S.S.R., (I wonder why?) with more Russian aircraft than U.S., British, and French aircraft combined. But when I realized what else IL-2 had to offer, I knew this was the best combat flight sim of all time. IL-2 includes over 400 different aircraft from the USSR, US, Britain, France, Germany, Norway, Finland, Romania, Slovakia, Australia, Japan, Singapore, China, and more! At least 250 of these are flyable, including: The A-20, B-25, P-38, P-39, P-40, P-47, P-51, P-63, YP-80, F2A Buffalo, SBD Dauntless, F4F Wildcat, F6F Hellcat, F4F Corsair, Hurricane, Spitfire, Tempest, Beoufighter, Mosquito, I-153, I-16, Mig-3, Yak-3, Pe-2, and so many more that it would take a whole page to fit them. Many non-flyable never-before-modeled aircraft are present also, like the massive Me-323 6-engined transport, Ju-88 Mistel flying bomb, Fw-200 Condor, and many more. There are hundreds of different meticulously detailed tanks, vehicles, and warships. One of my favorite things about IL-2 is that the Pacific front of the war is included, along with US Navy and Japanese carrier borne aircraft, a great selection of Japanese land-based planes, the B-29, (non-flyable. Boo hoo.) submarines, torpedo boats, destroyers, cruisers, battleships, and many aircraft carriers. The mission builder is great, with 3D maps, condition settings, and infinite waypoint combinations. Tanks and other vehicles stick to roads when possible, but will go almost anywhere you program them to. The world is divided into separate smaller maps, which you can select. Many fronts are present, like Normandy, The Ardennes, Berlin, Gulf of Finland, Manchuria, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Midway, Hawaii, Moscow, and many more Russian maps. You can program waypoints for aircraft, tanks, and ships, and set the speed, altitude, direction, skill, paint job, gun accuracy, firing rate, and more. The missions are good, but you will find that you will enjoy making your own missions much more. The aircraft, vehicle, ship, building, sky, ocean, and terrain graphics are all unparalleled by any other sim, with outstanding detail from huge forests of 3D trees and rocky mountains, to super detailed buildings and tanks with words even visible on the sides! You can even see personnel at their positions on ships! The AI for everything is incredible, enemy aircraft know advanced maneuvers, tanks aim their turrets and fire at enemies, and ship turrets and flak guns fire accurately at targets. However, IL-2s user interface is lousy. The menu is boring and has tiny buttons for everything, but this is nothing compared to the quick and full mission builders. For over 350 aircraft, and a few thousand other vehicles, buildings, and objects, there are tiny drop down lists which you must scroll through to select anything. The scroll bar is 3/16ths of an inch wide, (I kid you not!) and is so short that it takes about 30 seconds to get your curser centered over it. When zoomed in to a map, it switches to 3D mode for the entire terrain, so this will slow down your computer and curser significantly unless you have a high-end graphics card. Between this and the scroll bars of death, it is almost impossible to do anything on the mission builder without a good mouse. My cousin owns IL-2, and he can hardly move his curser at all on the mission builder. The frame rate in flight is about  to 2 frames per second, (F.P.S.) which is horrible. Target F.P.S. is usually about 20 F.P.S.. This is probably because his graphics card is outdated. However, I have a very old IBM ThinkPad laptop with Windows XP, and IL-2 works just fine on it. If possible though, you want a high-end graphics card, and a large screen. The intro music is pretty cool, but when you hear the main menu music, you will burst out laughing. It sounds like circus music, or something from a corny cartoon. But, amazingly, IL-2 gives you the ability to change system files, unlike most other sims, so you can switch the circus music with something less annoying. There is also the issue of swearing. The box says it includes mild swearing, but I would debate that. At some points, it seems like all the pilots ever say is the same swearword over and over, which is not realistic anyways since Japanese, German, Russian, and French pilots wouldnt speak English. But, luckily, again you can change this in a notepad system file called conf.ini, by changing the noswearing: value from 0 to 1, and save. I really appreciate the ability to change system files on this sim, you can fix many of the annoying problems once and for all. All in all, this is the BEST combat flight sim my friends or I have ever seen, defiantly a must-have for WWII airplane buffs. Since IL-2 1946, Ubisoft has come out with more combat flight sims, I have not bought any of these yet, though.  Pros: Incredible graphics, Ability to fly many medium bombers, Amazing selection of flyable and non-flyable aircraft, Great AI, Many war fronts available, Awesome ships. Ability to change system files.  Cons: Cant fly heavy bombers like the B-17, B-24, B-29, etc, Russian embellishment, Bad user interface, Runs slowly on older graphics cards.  What sets it apart: Unmatched graphics and realism, Huge selection of aircraft, tanks, vehicles, and ships.  Thank you for reading this, now I don't feel like I wrote all this for nothing.	1
So far this seems to be a good program. Im still learning it and my experiance of it impresses me.	1
The Golden Era of PC-based flight simulation began with Microprose F19 Stealth Fighter, and it ended with Falcon 4.0.  As a real pilot who has played every single flight sim worth playing for the last 25 years, I'm comfortable saying that Jane's WWII Fighters is in the top 3 of all time, period.  It is worth installing a W98 emulator on your modern PC so that you can have the experience of flying this sim.  Quite simply, if you want to do what the real WWII fighter pilots did - search the skies for the enemy, get shot at by flak guns, strafe trains and other ground targets and get into frantic, adrenaline-pumping dogfights with steely-eyed Germans over hostile territory, this sim puts you in that place like nothing before or since.  The airplanes have just the right combination of realistic flight model, available systems and visual/audio effects to be entertaining without being overwhelming to the non-pilot.  The AI is challenging enough to give you a workout, but also makes you want to dogfight real people online - something that I did for years and that was absolutely the height of PC-based air combat.  Finally, the Mission Creator was the ultimate geek tool.  Using it, you could craft unbelievably realistic WWII flying missions that involved takeoffs, landings and everything in between from escorting bombers to bombing things yourself, all while being fired at by Wirbelwinds, 88's and German aircraft.  I can still remember the thrill of dogfighting the Me-262 in a P-51 and reminding the Germans that (in the words of Chuck Yeager,) "it isn't the machine, it's the man."  The days when we were hoping for Jane's to release the Pacific version of this stellar and incomparable sim are long gone.  Jane's died as a PC flight simulation maker, along with basically everyone else except for a few 800 lb gorillas like Microsoft.  At this point, all we can do is hope that SOMEONE recognizes what a great sim this is, and decides to update it for XP.  It happened with Falcon 4.0, and it would really be worth doing with Jane's WWII Fighters.	1
Janes World War II Fighters is a great game. It includes 7 planes -- 4 from the Allies (USA and Britain), and, of course, 3 from the Axis (Germany only). All of these planes are a joy to fly, once you get used to their diverse handling methods. All aspects of the game are high quality, and really give you the feeling that you are in the cockpit of a World War II era plane. After all, that's what sims are for. The game is really fun to play. It offers a little something for everyone...if you are a flight sim fanatic, you can turn realism settings on high. If you are an arcade fan, you can turn them down. The game also offers training missions which include such things as how to take off, how to land, how to dive bomb...etc. They're really helpful! Also, there are a bunch of play modes. Single Mission -- which lets you pick pre-existing missions. My favorite was an allied mission, in which you were a German fighter who realized Germany was going to be beaten, so you steal a Me 262 and fly it to an Allied base...with two other 262's on your tail! Anyway, Campaign -- lets you fly in a Campaign for either the Allies or the Axis powers...which is really fun. The only problem with that is that you don't get to pick a particular plane and fly it every time...for instance, I really suck with a P-38J...and I'd like to fly a Mustang every mission, if for nothing more than the fact that I'd get really good with it. Mission builder -- is pretty fun, but it takes a while to get used to. The readme on triggers is really helpful for that, though.  Quick Mission -- lets you pick what plane you want to fly in, how many wingman you have, how many enemies you have (and you can even have Axis Fighters versus Axis. It's pretty cool seeing 109's fight each other) time of day, weapon loadout, and many other things. Overall, great gameplay! The graphics are good, but on my system, I experience a lot of slowdown...even with a lot of features turned down or off (like 3D clouds, detail, etc.) That would be so bad, but with the system I'm playing on...I expect a smooth framerate. That only occurs when a whole lot is going on though, like 16 planes on your side, tanks on both sides, and enemy fighters...all doing their own thing.   The graphics quality is excellent...when I was flying a night mission, I just couldn't believe it was a game and not a movie I was playing. It looked so good, in fact, I could see the moon glimmering off of the paint of my Focke-Wulf! Amazing! Like I said, graphics are amazing, I just wish the frame rate was a little better.   Overall I would recommend this game to most people interested in the flight genre.  Be forewarned, however, if you are playing this game with a Logitech Wingman Force you may experience some problems with the controls.  For instance, sometimes the force feedback will just "turn off" after a mission is over.  Other times, it will occur when you go to the main menu and then come back into your game.  However, this only happened every so often, and really didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the game too much.  However, it was significant enough to knock a star off of the review for it.	1
This sim came out in 1999 and, given the dearth of simulation/games devoted to WWII since then, it's still a near-cutting edge game. Though its title makes it sound similar to other "Jane's Fighters" games like ATF or USNF '97 - and despite similar gameplay - the sound, graphics and organization of JWW2F put the game in a class by itself.  You can probably guess the premise - fly single missions, campaigns or instant action in your choice of many WWII planes like the Mustang, Me-262 or Spitfire.  If you've made short work of your computer's flying abilities, go on-line (though by the time you read this, Janes multi-player support will be long dead) and flame your best friends.  The airplanes' exteriors look gorgeous - nowhere near as cartoonish as those on ATF/USNF.  The interiors look pretty good to, really conveying the feeling of being inside a (likely) freezing P-51 flying against camouflaged Panzer tanks during the "Battle of the Bulge".  If the effect isn't exactly spectacular, it's still an achievement considering that the interiors - like those on USNF/ATF - are really eye-candy: you can turn them on and off, so they're really extraneous.  Despite their being unneccessary, EA deisgners decided against making the panels and frames of your cockpit look flat and unconvincing.  Get a hit on your engine, and your plane will vibrate or spew oil - and boy will you notice that.  Damage is also beefed up since ATF/USNF days, with damaged airplanes more prone to snap in two if forced to fly at the edge of their limits than undamaged airplanes.  Different airplanes will fly different ways - I was able to outfly speedy Me-109 fighters as long as I could keep from flying the high-speed vertical maneauvers they favored.  The tactic is harder to use against the Me-262, the Nazi's early jet (which will attack in pairs; the trick is to anticipate which of the jets is just leading you on, and which is really about to attack) but not impossible.  If the sim has some realism flaws (mind you, I'm no pilot) some are likely unavoidable - like the fact that air combat was never a pure fighter war (for the allies over Europe, it may have been; the Germans contended, on the other hand, with bombers - both light and medium - tactical attack planes, recon fighters and other support craft; the Me-262 itself was never really contemplated as a fighter to fight other fighters, its acceleration and wing-loading made it best only for flying past escort screens and for being able to engage more waves of enemy bombers than older fighters).  Velocity is modeled very well, as are the vaporous effects of clouds at different levels, and the fluidity of fire from stricken planes (I mostly saw my own).  Ground detail was dissappointing, but this isn't a sim committed to low-level attack, so I was willing to overlook that.  In short, sound and graphics make this a still superlative sim - not as demanding as UbiSoft's "IL-2".  While you won't be able to import 3rd party airplanes or missions (as you may with Microsoft's CFS series, Janes offers more out of the box than that other game. Performance:  I ran this game with little problem on my Pentium IV, 2Ghz system using WinXP and a Geforce3 card.  If you're looking for a great WWII game but feel intimidated by IL-2 (and have heard some bad news re: "Jane's Attack Squadron", I'd consider getting this game.	1
IF YOU WANT THE REAL THING AND WANT TO KNOW HOW THE PILOTS IN WW11 "DID THEIR THING" GET THIS GAME=TAKE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT IT FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE RATED IT AND ADD TEN PERCENT=THIS IS SO REAL RIGHT DOWN TO THE WAY YOU CRASH=WHILE ON ONE MISSION I WAS HIT BY AA FIRE AND IT BLEW MY COWLING ON MY ENGINE AND I COULD SEE ALL THE EXHAUST SYSTEM AND MOVING ENGINE PARTS=THE DETAIL THAT WAS INSTALLED ON THIS GAME IS UNEQUALED=THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THIS TOGETHER HAD PRIDE IN THEIR WORK AND IT SHOWS=JUST AN AMAZING GAME!!!!	1
Janes  WWII Fighters is another great Janes game.  The game features 35 missions, both Axis Allies.  There is also a mission editor and fun Internet(LAN) play.  The graphics in the game is simple great.  You can see the bullet holes in the airplane, 3-D clouds, fire and smoke, ect.  The graphics are very smooth and excellent lighting effects.  The game as very good damage effects.  But there could have made the "cities or towns" denser or in a greater detail. There is a great amount of airplanes; p-51 Mustang, P-47D Thunderbolt, P-38J Lightning, Supermarine Spitfire Mk. IX, Bf 109G-6, Fw190A-8, and Me 262A1.  The gameplay is pretty good, the areas such as the A.I are pretty good.  The lay out of the airplane is a weaker area of the game.  It's very annoying, you can't see the gages very  well.  But you use a pop-up tool to see them better.  The weakest area of the game is the realism part of it.  The auto pilot will fly around and shoot at enemy.  All so in air to air combat you can't run into each other.  The all so doesn't give you the feeling that you're dog fighting at 20,000 feet in the air.  Over all I would have to say that you should give this game a try.(For the money)  Or you can aim for Microsoft Combat Simulator.	1
On most current games like Unreal 2 for Xbox, you have to control the aiming manually. But with this Spawn game for Dreamcast, it has automatic lock-on aiming, and the sword and axe weapons do not require you to aim.  So it's very easy to control your characters movement, and it's not frustrating.  There are over 30 characters taken from the comicbook. And most of them look great in 3D graphics.  I think this is one of the top 5 games made for the Dreamcast. Although the Dreamcast certainly had more than 20 games that were A+ quality.	1
When i first saw Spawn:In the Demons Hand for Sega Dreamcast i was not sure whether the game would be any good.  I remember the other spawn games for other syatems and i was always dissapointed.  I am not a large Spawn comic book fan but i do think those action figures were pretty cool.  I decided to get the game because it looked like a pretty good game, but i kept the reciept just in case. I threw that reciept away so fast.  This game is the most incredible game i have played in a long time.  It has so much replay and great multiplayer, i just loved it.  It reminds me of a mixture between Quake 3 Arena and Power Stone 2.  The crazy gun battles with awesome powerups, combined with huge multi-level arenas and items of mass destruction scattered about the arena makes this one crazy game.  The camera and controls seemed odd at first but they became like second nature.  Each charachter you pick has his own certain weapons ans super attacks it takes a while before you master them all.  Go pick this one up as soon as possible, trust me you won't be dissapointed.	1
... but it's really not!  The only thing really complicated about this game is the fact that it very accurately depicts the city/civiliation management aspects.  However, the game DOES feature extensive automation commands that will run things according to the directives you set.  I would highly recommend playing Civiliation II a few times before getting into this though because it will help get you used to the systems in the game.  The only thing that really proves confusing is a lack of real world base for the technologies in the game.  Since it's set in the future, all the technology is pretty much "alien" and thus it can be hard to get your bearings. Like I said, play Civilization II first to get a feel for the system ( and just because it's an outstanding game in it's own right) then play through the game on the easiest level a few times.  The opposition will be nihil and it will give you a chance to familiarize yourself with the futuristic technologies.  The game is complex, but for fans of the genre that IS NOT a bad thing, just may take some getting used to.  All in all, it plays alot like Civ 2, don't give up so easilly!	1
If you like strategy games you've probably played Civilization II. Not doing so would be the same as saying you like desserts but have never tasted apple pie. Alpha Centauri is a rare treat for your strategy gaming taste buds. This game takes up where Civilization II left off - humanity departing Earth, heading for the star Alpha Centauri and it's planetary system to start afresh. We begin in typical human fashion - divided - the colonists have split into 7 factions, each seeking to develop their new home in their own fashion. Gameplay is similar to Civilization II. As head of one of the factions you start with a single city, the first objective being exploration of the surrounding darkness and establishing your civilization. Quickly you encounter others and are faced with decisions. The game demands that you strike the right strategic balance between the imperatives of exploration, research, building and conquest. How will you seek to win? Through economic victory, military conquest or achieving transcendence? The ability to achieve different victories underlies one of the strengths of the game. Each faction has well developed philosophies and ideologies and their approach to life on Planet is influenced by these biases and it affects gameplay. For instance the Morganites emphasize economic development, the University faction pursues research, Gaians have an environmentally friendly approach to living on the planet and the UN group seeks peace and harmony. Beliefs affect behaviour and interaction between factions is excellently managed through a sophisticated diplomacy framework. Dealing with the Lord's believers and the militaristic Spartans is an exercise in patience and a lesson in managing aggression. Another very sophisticated element is the ability to engage in social engineering which allows you to subtley shift your civilizations philosophy. Other strengths are the design workshop which allows for customization of units and the 'Governor' which can be fully automated to carry out city life according to the assigned imperatives (build, explore, research or military). If the coming 'Empire Earth' lives up to it's promise, this game may be topped, but until then Alpha Centauri continues to shine as the brightest star in the strategy game genre.	1
This game has a super thick book full of instuctions and with everything there is to control, build, and change, this game can be overwhelming. It takes forever to learn what each function is and to read the instruction book. This game is a case of a little too much. A friend I work with had played Civilization 2 which is another Sid Meier game that did exceptionaly well, but after he played this game for 2 weeks, he gave up. there was just too much stuff to learn and what certain things did was not clearly described which left alot of guessing. What he and I did learn while playing the game was that the story was good, the graphics are good, and the game was well thought out. But the overwhelming things you had to learn just took it's toll which probably explains the lackluster sales of this game.	-1
Amidst all of the other Street Fighter games, I believe this is the best one, even though it did not receive much attention in U.S. arcades.  The gameplay is responsive and accurate, and the Dreamcast version is virtually arcade perfect.  The only factor which keeps me from giving it a perfect score is the music (rap/R&B music in a Street Fighter game?!), and the slightly pixelated graphics.  I recommend this game to hardcore Street Fighter fans, because casual gamers may just see it as more of the same.  Lastly, this game must be played with an arcade stick or import controller to be fully enjoyed... the regular Dreamcast controller is just too awkward and cheap.	1
All right, all you old-school, 2-D fight fans out there...this is it.  The best 2-D fighter on any home console (with Marvel vs. Capcom 2 a CLOSE second) finally arrives on the DC.  Capcom may have yet to learn how to count past three (heck, it took 'em eight years to get past TWO!) but this one is absolutely the greatest of the Street Fighter series.  The characters are plentiful (19 in all); their animation, just like the box ad says, seamless (if a tad pixelated).  Gameplay is just like we Street Fighter fans like it; with the addition of a few new tricks (like parrying and leap attacks to confuse low-blockers).  Backgrounds are beautiful as usual, and some of the items in the stages interact with the fight (like the leaves shifting on the ground when someone's head makes impact with it).  The music's great too; a nice blend of jazz/fusion and cranking guitar.  All that and the return of fan-favorite Chun-Li make for a wonderful fighting experience for just about anyone.  You'll have some good fun with figuring out the new parrying system, the super arts, bonus stages, etc. as well.  Even though the gameplay may be a little simplistic to some (especially Marvel vs. Capcom 2 fans), it's complex in its simplicity and should give you at least a few months of steady play, which is pretty good for a fighting game.  The only reasons I gave it four stars is that the computer opponents are rather hard to beat, and if you're new to fighting games, that's trouble; and while the fighters move as fluidly as running water, they look a little too rough around the edges for Dreamcast standards, especially when they were hand-drawn.	1
Before I start gushing about the greatness of this game, a word of warning is in order.  If you already picked up second impact for the DC you may wish to either hold off on this title or trade-up for it (the latter being my personal take as 3rd strike offers a lot that 2nd impact does not.) Well, where to start?  Street fighter 3 is a visual treat, completely inseperable from playing an anime.  The characters have so much animation it is really stunning.  For all the people who whined about it taking so long for SF3 to show up--this is why: the technology wasn't there immediately to do what they have accomplished with the SF3 series which is to make the most beautiful 2D game ever. Gameplay is of course exactly where it should be.  Ultra-tight controls and deep game play.  Some people have complained that SF3 slows down the pace considerably from the alpha series, and by removing air blocking, has in fact gone backwards, however this makes SF3 much less spastic and more rewarding in the long run.  Capcom has not forgotten its fan base however, and much of these features can be altered. It also seems worth mentioning that 3rd strike includes a relatively large roster of characters--19!  I know that doesn't stand up to Marvel vs. Capcom2, but if you compare what's really being offered you'll find that the characters in games like MvC2 are mere shadows of their SF3 counterparts.  Here the characters feel as though they do in fact exist--as though they have weight and behave in a realistic fashion (well, beyond throwing fireballs!)  Given the degree of work that must have gone into every character here, 19 seems like a lot!  What's more, beyond tweleve, there doesn't seem to be a weak character in the lot.  Pretty impressive given that early SF games often suffered from characters being unbalenced in strength. I also want to mention the sound on this game which is well above normal Capcom standards.  It isn't that I am a big fan of hip-hop, but this makes the game infinitely more cool.  I mean, we are talking Street Fighter, not Office Fighter.  Enough of the sterile synthisizer soundtracks.  All the fighting scenes have great musical backdrops, but even better are the short rap numbers that accompany all the inbetween scenes.  There is a rap song for selecting your character, a very short one while you choose who you will fight ('check it out now, third strike y'all'), and plenty of others.  This definitely ups the cool factor way above 2nd impact! OK, here is the BIG difference and the reason why you'll want to get this even if you have second impact.  3rd Strike can be completely modified.  I've toyed around with this a bit, turning on chain combos, air blocking, etc. and really turned 3rd strike into a completely different game.  This ability to get under the hood of the Street Fighter engine puts 3rd strike up there with Alpha 3 in its awesome potential for replayability.  If you choose, now you can have all three supers available at the same time, use chain combos, cancel super arts into other super arts...  Its all up to you.  There is even enough here to keep the Marvel vs. Capcom fan happy as you can make the game quite spastic if you feel the urge. All in all, this is one of those top-tier games for the dreamcast that really makes owning the system a necessity for fighting game fans.	1
Good news: -It's a greatly evolved Street Fighter -Some interesting characters -Bison has met his match(Gill) Bad news: -Punches, kicks, and moves look a little crooked Weird things: -Why didn't they add some more characters from the Alpha series(i.e. Sakura, Charlie, Sodom, etc.) Final thought: This is a pretty great Steet Fighter game with some interesting stuff.  But they don't have to have such awkward-looking moves.	1

This game is even more awsome and more bad @$$ than Double Impact and Alpha 3, infact, it's way past Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes and Capcom Vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millenium 2001(it's top of my list in other words). They had nothing to improve but over-all sound FX and music, so they figured lets make better music for everones stages and improve over-all sound FX, and they did. Akuma(Gouki) is no longer a secret character, but Shin Gouki is(YES, THAT'S RIGHT I SAID SHIN GOUKI), and they have 6 new characters: Twelve, who like Shang Tsung from the Mortal Kombat series, can change into all of the characters in the game, including Gill.  Speaking of Gill, Remmy is also one of the 6 new characters very similar to Charli and Guile, more to Charli, reason being is one of his Super-Arts, it is Charli's from the Marvel/Capcom Vs. series.  The last four characters are Q whom identity of is a secret, even to the CIA(it might not even be human), Makoto, the 2nd Ryu wannabe, but with a style less like the shotokan style of that belonging to Ryu Ken and Gouki, Shin Gouki(as said above), and last but not least....... Chun-Li, with a new look and style, described by GameSpot as more similar to Tai-Chi.  The soundtrack to the game rules, the rap songs are freaking awsome, have a slick beat, and they make you want to get up and break dance in the middle of the game(seriously, I can break dance and if I could I would just from some of the beats of this game, not all of them but some, not all are hip-hop based music, some jazz type and a little rock, that's what rule about this game, so much diverstiy with everything). It is a very impressive 2-D game, hell, it is the most impressive 2-D fighter ever.  One of the best features is that you can choose your opponent for the next match out of 2 characters and no matter which of the two characters you choose for your next bout, they tie in perfectly to the story line for your character.  Better than that, they kept the parry, introduced in the 1st SFIII game(also featured in Capcom Vs. SNK 2 available in P-Groove), it is my favorite feature of this game, if you don't know what parrying is, you basicly perform a "quick-block" much like that of the Alpha-Counter intorduced in the Alpha series.  You basicly tap forward(for a high and medium attacks) or down(for low and air attacks) just before the move hits, you take no damage, and if your opponent hits you with an attack that he or she phisicaly touches you with(a punch or kick move, not a projectile) it leaves the opponent "frozen" if you will, for any and every attack available for a very short period of time, but enough to pull off whatever is in your arsinal of attacks, but it doesn't freez opponents who throw projectiles(as said above), so basicly, you can parry a fireball, but it won't "freez" the opponent.  Best of all, you can parry multiple hits consecutively(like all hits of Ryu's Shinkuu Hadouken, one by one, but you have to parry as many times as their are hits, like if their is a 12 hit move/combo, you have to tap forward or down 12 seperate times, but you take no damage for any of the hits you have parried).  The modes are an excellent feature to this game, and the 20 characters rule(finally the roster is fairly sizable for a STREET FIGHTER III game, 21 if you count Giil, but he's not playable, sorry all you Gill players).  So if you are a true Street Fighter Fan(like myself) and want a real game, than what are you waiting for, buy this game now.  My only dissapointment for this game, is it is the last of the the Street Fighter series, but I wouldn't have it any other way, because CAPCOM ended it's terrific series with a huge bang!	1
During the existence of the Dreamcast, Capcom has been releasing a whole lot of their best titles ever created like Power Stone, Tech Romancer, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Marvel VS Capcom, JoJo's Bizzare Adventure, Resident Evil: Code Veronica, and more ! When the Street Fighter III series came out starting with Double Impact, it has made every SF fan's dream come true and when Third Strike came out a year after Double Impact, it was agreed that it was one of the greatest SF titles among the series, according to the fans. Some people would say it's the worst Street Fighter ever, or as always, just another Street Fighter game. Whoever doubts this game or gives it a low score, is totally out of their mind. Street Fighter III: Third Strike in my opinion, is still revolutionary and arcade perfect even today. The graphics look even better than that of the two Street Fighter III titles featured in Double Impact. There are barely any pixels and the characters move at a smooth framerate. Furthermore, most characters look like they're featured in an anime. The backgrounds and special effects look great but some stages look kinda dull. The audio is improved and better than ever. The background music is pumped up with techno and hip-hop. It even has their own rap song about the game itself which sounds fairly catchy. The sound effects during fights still sound like the ones from the other SF3 series like the hitting and the hyper sound of executed super moves. The gameplay is much improved over the other Street Fighter III games and the fighting engine is much better. Now you can parry in any direction, even in the air. Plus, you get an arsenal of new moves for each character, but not all of them. The controls still remains faithful to the SF3 series, but it has more variety than the other SF fighting engines. And finally, in one of the Bonus Stages during the Arcade mode, you can hit an SUV Truck until it explodes. This was an old element featured in Street Fighter II where you hit a car in both directions. Now it's featured in this game. And you still get the Parrying stage where Sean throws numerous red, white, and blue Basketballs. When it comes to a selection of characters, it doesn't get any better than this. You still get classic characters like Ryu, Ken, Akuma, Yun, Yang, Alex, Dudley, Urien, Oro, Necro, Elena, Sean, Ibuki, and Hugo. Plus some new characters like Q, Remy, Twelve, Makoto, and the triumphant return of the first lady of Street Fighter, Chun-Li. So in the end, Street Fighter III: Third Strike is one of the greatest 2D fighters ever known in the Dreamcast's library of 2D fighting games. If you never bought this one, you have already missed out on one of the greatest 2D fighters, and you'll have to wait a little longer for a used version to arrive at your retailer. But by all means, if you still like Street Fighter, Third Strike will not dissappoint.	1
For someone who loves 2D fighters, this game is a sign sent down from the heavens. The combo system is fantastic, the music and sound effects are amazing, and the graphics are the best graphics ever in a 2D game. This game might be hard for begginers, but if you practice enough, it will get eaisier.	1
This game is great.  It take a while getting used to the new fighting system, but once you get the hang of it you'll be set.  The big difference in this game from other SF games is the "parrying" mode which allows you to block an opponents move by breaking the move and taking the advantage.  The music is pretty good too, you get a variety of tracks (different styles)and the graphics are the best in any streetfighter so far.  As you may have read elsewhere, the game's boss "Gill" is pretty cheap, he had me mouthing off the screen at times, but I managed to cheese him back.  Here's a tip on how to beat Gill: set the rounds to 1 and beat him as fast as you can before his special art metter reaches maximum, this disables him from using his cheap regenerating move and you only have to beat him once.  I've beat him with 8 different characters so far and I haven't even been playing that long.  If you're a button masher you can forget about this game, you will not get anywhere with button mashing.  Great graphics, sound, and gameplay are the reasons you should get this game. Anyway, this game is well worth the buck, and at this price you should be going to jail because it's a steal.  So come on, go on and get it. Now is the time to strike, before the games becomes scarce.	1
Street Fighter games have always been my favorite games around, and when I heard that Third Strike was coming to Dreamcast, I quickly pre-ordered a copy. This game is a BLAST! Sure, there's only 19 fighters to choose from, but the selection is great. The difficulty is strangely hard. Even on the easiest setting, I still had a heck of a time betting the game with Akuma. The last boss, Gill, is so cheap with his attacks that I almost pulled my hair out every time I fought him. That's my only gripe. Its a great game, with some depth with learning parrying and mastering all of the super arts. A must own for any Street Fighter fan.	1
Except for two things. Gill is still one of the cheesiest characters in videogame history. Lets be honest I don't know what Capcom's problem has been over the last couple of years but they can't seem to design a final boss in any of their games that doesn't stink cheese all the way to Wisconsin. I mean it's like they hit a high point with Akuma and haven't figured out what to do next. On the second problem it's really minor. I would like a little background story for this game because when you finally beat the game the endings make no sense whatsoever. This is more of a personal gripe than a flaw but it's something I wanted to point out. Now, for the good points. A 99% perfect arcade translation, now if only they would do it in High res, wow. Graphics are wonderful it looks like every frame is there. The controls are tight as usual, there is a slight timing differential when using a super art with different strengh buttons but maybe that's just me. The backgrounds are a little bland but atleast there's more action going on in them now and they're not as static as they once were. The new characters are a nice addition with the possible exception of Q who is a complete waste of Sprites, but Makato may be every little girls Ryu, she is way tight if you know how to use her. Also, there's some inuendo in this game that Guile or Charlie/Nash has some fatherless rug rats running around when you play the game you'll know what I mean. If you like strategic fighting, which I do, you'll love this game. This is not for button mashers, sorry Soul Caliber. If you're stuck on 3-d games like Tekken or Soul Caliber, which are nice in their own way, you probably won't dig Street Fighter 3 too much, but then again you don't have to worry about your 8 year old little brother, who's never played the game beating your pants off by button mashing with a character like Eddie. Don't laugh I've seen it happen a dozen times in the arcade.	1
this game is a definte improvment over the first two street fighter 3's. However, you will find this game boring in a way because you pretty much would use old school tactics that you used in double impact or so. Gill is more cheap in this one especially with the new angel of death super. The new characters aren't really impressive either except for Chun-Li, Makoto, and Remy(however it's really easy to still beat them with the old timers). Nothing really new except that the old timers have gotten new endings comparing to first and second impact.	1
I have been playing 2d fighters for a very long time, and they are prolly my favorite type of games. Well, SF3:3rd strike is amoung the best i have ever played. Capcom as added a Grade Judge system that rates your performance after each fight, and you are always trying to best yourself by getting a super combo finish or a perfect win, this ads depth and is a great asset to the game. Also,they have added a newparrying system that, when mastered, alowys you to slap hadoukens and other moves away with ease, this is also a great touch. The characters are just what youd 'spect, and are animated so beutifully you will have to check to make sure you're not dreaming, absolutely amazing capcom. As if this weren't enough you can now save replays of any 2 player fight in their entirety, great for rubbing a win in your oponnents face. And they don't stop here. They mini games have returned. In arcade mode youll take a break to totally wreck an suv to earn bonus points, its just plain fun. The controll detection is great,etc.,etc.,etc. The game is basically 2d fighting perfection, and a fan of the grenre such as myself couldn't ask for much more.	1
This is a must have for any Street Fighter Fan! I've been playing Street Fighter since back in the days before it came out on SNES with Street Fighter Alpha being my favorite (arcade)! Street Fighter 3rd Strike has decent graphics, could have been better for what the DC is really capable of, but is good enough. The gameplay plays like your typical SF game should, though it takes some getting used to on the DC controller (I recommend getting an arcade type stick)The judge grading is a nice touch and welcome addition to the game. I do miss some of the older SF characters that are missing in the game like Guile and Bison, etc. and there is no online play to truly test your skills against the best fighters on the net, (I guess with the lag and everything it might be a little frustrating to play)Bottom line: its a great game so go out and pick up a copy.	1
SF3 : 3rd strike is a killer fighting game in every aspect.. Gorgeous graphics, killer animation.. Perfect controls. My only complaint is the horrible rap musick in the back ground.. What were you thinking, Capcom?? Bleargh!! Hmmm.. I say pick this up if you enjoy pure 2-D fighters, but make sure you also get Marvel VS Capcom 2.. That game is simply mind blowing! SF3 : 3rd strike doesn't dissapoint in the slightest, and it's good to see Akuma, Chunli join.. Ohh, about Chun li.. She looks totally yummy! Do plenty of high kicks so you can see her heart shaped buns! Do it! : ) Mmmm! Heh.. Anyway, back to the game.. buy this, and Marvel VS Capcom 2!	1
System Shock II is a first person shooter ...RPG by Looking glass studio's, It is somewhat like an RPG half life or a science friction thief. It has great storyline, Much better than stories in scifi movies, Very deep and detailed RPG gameplay and it is very creepy. SS2 is much bigger than the first system shock, Just like the first game it does not give us the complete story line, We have to figure it out from the e-mails and the logs we find through out the starship. The story line is that you play a soldier assigned to the Von Braun a faster than light starship, Something bizzare happens but you don't know what as you have amnesia, When you wakeup you find out that all of your crew members are dead and you are all alone. System Shock II's gameplay is much similar to the first system shock but it has a much better interface and controls. The sound effect's are simply superb it feels like you're really hearing something's happening, They really add up to the creepy atmosphere. SS2 is built on the dark engine used to create Thief, The engine was ok for the medieval thief game but very bad here, The graphics are ok but the art direction is very bad and the weapon effects are very silly, They should have used the Quake II engine. In some places the gameplay is very difficult even on the easy difficulty don't even think of playing in the impossible difficulty, There is even a warning in the document. The Zombies would shoot you with their shotguns causing you a lot of damage but when you search them after they are killed they would just have a broken shotgun, The zombies also respawn a lot. Another problem is the voice acting, They are great but the charecters keep on talking nonsence all the time and they get very annoying, And nowhere in the game must you eavesdrop on the hybrids to solve a puzzle ect, LG's other game Thief II has the same problem. Despite these problems System Shock II is a great game and surely the best RPG game i have ever played, If you like RPG games get System Shock II it is really great, Buy Deus Ex along you will love it too.	1
System Shock II was a sequel that came out of nowhere and hit the gaming  community like a bolt of lightning.  It was one of the first 1st person  shooter games that combined the usual tactics and traits of a shooter game  with roleplay elements.  Your goal isn't just to kill every monster in  sight, but also to solve a mystery on the ship. Another interesting  aspect is that you can set up your own skills and traits, either as a  fighter, a computer wiz, or a psychic.  Each skill will get your through  the obstacles in different ways and as you progress your prowess grows in  whatever areas you choose. The atmosphere is wonderful.  As you sneak  thorugh the darkened corridors there are sounds and bits of ambiance all  around you.  Zombies gibber as they hunt you down, monkeys chatter as they  prowl through the ships, cyborgs politely ask you to come out (so they can  explode in your face), steam hisses from vents, computers humm softly.  This game has the hairs on my neck standing up half the time or threw me  into wild fits as I tried to get myself out of a suprise attack. The only  downsides to the game were the monster re-spawning after you had cleared  out a level and the rapid degredation of guns while you used them, but  there is a game patch that very nicely handles this problem and also allows  you to play cooperative multiplayer if you desire. All in all this game  is very much worth the price.  If you want a nice shooter game with enough  atmosphere and history to make it seem real then this is the perfect game  for you.	1
I have played through both the original System Shock and System Shock 2 to completion.  Having done so, I have to say that SS2 is one of the most over-rated games in history, and every time it shows up on some game magazine's "overlooked works of genius" page or the like, I want to scream.  First, let me get it out of the way: Yes, the story is very good (and I was particularly struck by the plot twist that introduces your ultimate enemy.)  Yes, the sound design is good.  Yes, the atmosphere is great- very spooky, very isolating.  But it's one thing to feel that your enemies hate you, and another entirely to feel that the _game_ hates you.  There are a dozen little ways this comes off, like that you can HURT yourself by running into things, and make it WORSE by increasing your agility stat and thus your speed.  I do believe that's a first for First-Person-Shooters, and _please_, for the love of God, let it be the last.  There's the fact that you can be shot a dozen times by an enemy, and when you finally kill him, mysteriously discover the weapon he was firing on you was not only devoid of ammunition, but broken to boot.  There's that the game's system explicitly _expects_ you to die repeatedly (if you have enough money you get restored to life at a sort of save-point, more on that later.)  There's a sequence that has you running back and forth trying to find a series of numbers for a passcode, one number per location, and all the while, the monsters keep up their infinite respawn while you're about your busy-work.  (What would have been the problem with your so-called benefactor putting the entire code in one location?...)  But ultimately, it comes down to economics.  The designers were so terribly afraid that the player would, at some time, have an EXCESS of something, that they overcompensated the other way.  The money of the game is called nanites, and ultimately, they're used for everything.  Die and get restored to life?  Cough up some nanites.  Want to open a locked box?  Cough up some nanites... Oh, and by the way, all that box contains is slightly fewer nanites than it cost you to try.  (Why did someone put a security lock on the equivalent of a nickel?  One of those great mysteries, I guess.)  Out of ammo?  Go to the vending machine, and cough up some more nanites.  Or you could hack the machine- for yet more nanites- and then it would give you LOWER PRICES!  I don't know about you, but when I hack something like a vending machine, I expect to get something for free.  I guess I'm silly that way.  And even if you have ammo, your gun might just break, given the uniquely corrosive qualities of the atmosphere on the ship.  But don't worry, you can buy a repair tool- for a few nanites!  (Though repairing a weapon degrades its quality, and makes it more likely to break down in the future.  Thanks, guys.)  Poisoned?  Your fate is sealed, unless you buy an antidote.  More nanites!  Or you can buy a recycling tool, and discover that what it gives you for recycling most items wouldn't buy you a lousy soft drink.  Maybe you're a psionic, using the awesome, infinite powers of the human mind as your weapon?  Great- but restoring your psychic energies means buying a psi-restoring potion.  More nanites!  For all the talk in the manual about making psionics more than "just another gun", this particular aspect succeeds in making them _exactly_ that, and a gun much like the others that is going to fire twice and then need to be switched out for something that still has ammo.  And isn't broken.  And you have the skill to use.  After a few rounds of "BANG BANG click click <switch> BANG BANG BANG click <switch> ZAP ZAP ZAP click click <switch>" you realize that what's making the hairs on the back of your neck stand up isn't terror, it's IRRITATION.  A simple equation: Infinite, respawing enemies + Finite resources = game that hates you.  Is it really so much to ask that a foe that's been shooting you have ammunition on them?  Especially if you're going to have to face an unlimited supply of them?  There's a moment in most games of both the RPG and FPS genre near the end where you feel that you are _ready_.  You're bad.  You've got the best weapons, a full stock of ammunition, the best spells, or whatever- you've learned the tactics you need to take on foes over many hours of play, and you know that what's coming up is going to be hard and it's going to take ingenuity and everything you've got.  But it's going to be fun and you have what you need to make it possible, and you're ready.  In System Shock 2, that moment never comes. The designers were too afraid of the player having an excess, and as a result, you never have _enough_.  Not even at the end.  You've been nickeled and dimed through the whole game by poison, by the unending tide of zombies, by busy-work, by hacking or lockpicking things that turned out not to be worth the sacrifices, by taking damage in places you didn't expect, by reloading and repairing weapons that break down at a fantastic rate... And ultimately, that's not scary.  It's frustrating.  It's irritating.  It's wearying.  But it's not scary.  And yes, I finished the game.  No, I felt no compulsion to play through it again as a different type of character.  There's other little things, like that they replaced the ungainly but interesting pseudo-VR hacking of the original System Shock with a guessing game somewhere in complexity between tic-tac-toe and minesweeper.  Or that the only thing your character actually says for the entire game deflates the tension of a climactic moment for the sake of a dumb joke.  Or that the bad guys seem to offer you the opportunity to ally with them, but the designers never considered making that opportunity a real one...  I've said more than enough.  Pick up the original Deus Ex if you like games of the genre; let this "sleeper hit" continue sleeping.  P.S.  At least two of the _positive_ reviewers have blithely stated something along the lines of "Well, yes, it's so hard you have to use cheat codes to complete it, but..."  Do you guys really expect so little of game designers that you're willing to forgive this kind of grotesque mis-design in pacing and difficulty?  Are you so desperate for games with an actual storyline that you're willing to ignore enormous flaws?	-1
Several things make this hybred shooter / RPG hard: First there aren't large piles of ammo available and most monsters only drop one bullet, shell, etc. You'll almost always be short of ammo, needing to resort to the default weapon, a wrench, especially on the early levels. You really will need to make every shot count. Additionally unlike most low ammo shooters, this game, while having some stealth elements is not stealth game. You sneak around some but there is the occasional large firefight you can't avoid. The last hard part is the slow rate that you acquire weapons and even after you find them, you can't carry them all. It'll take a long time to find and gain the skills to use better weapons and the limited inventory space means you'll be making some hard choices.  Not just a shooter, you find 'cybernetic modules' that you use to upgrade your abilities. Upgrades include the usual statistics (strength, agility, endurance, etc), weapon skills, psonic abilities and technical skills. The technical skills are the most important, you have repair and modify your weapons, research unknown items you find and hack into computers, security systems and other items. This hacking skill is most important skill you have. You won't enough modules for all the upgrades so choose wisely.  Aside from difficulty and RPG features the game provides a good story. Your path is fairly linear and there's a bit too much key collecting there are a couple plot twists.  And while the space ship interior graphics are mundane, the sound design is excellent. You'll need a good speaker setup to hear things coming up behind you or in the distance ahead.  One disappointment: most monsters re-spawn. My preference has been to clear out an area and have it stay cleared.  I had no problems running this game on Windows 2000 although switching to the desktop caused a nVidia-based blue screen of death.	1
My favorite thing about SSII is that it tells a coherent story that makes sense.  Every action you take in SSII is motivated by a desire to accomplish a clearly-stated objective.  Goals are not assigned arbitrarily, either, and are extremely well-explained by the superb voice acting.  When you accomplish a mission, you are rewarded with access to more areas of the ship and new missions to accomplish.  Another great aspect of this game is the way it flows.  There are no levels, other than levels/decks within the ship you are trying to escape from, and accomplishing certain objectives means traversing multiple decks.  There are times when this game is extremely scary.  It's designed to frighten you, and at times it accomplishes this goal very well.  The music is mostly techno, but it's scary techno.  That might not make sense to you, but trust me, it can be very intimidating at times.  If you haven't played the original System Shock read up on its plot before you play this game.  The background information you gain will help you out a lot.  Overall, this is on my top ten all-time.	1
I grew up being a horror film fan, and it takes a fair amount of eerie-ness to move me. I've also played hundreds of computer games, many of which tout themselves as being in the horror genre. But enough about me... "System Shock 2" is easily the most atmospheric and downright frightening game I've ever played. It has a permanent home on my hard drive, thanks to its fair amount of replayability, and absolutely excellent gameplay. Essentially, the game is similar to many "first person shooters" in the way it operates. That's where its similarity to other games stops. Keep your lights turned on when you play this one..! "System Shock 2" is a masterpiece of space horror. Your all-seeing and ever-present foe... the supercomputer named "SHODAN"... has my vote as the most diabolical and psychologically disturbing antagonist I have ever run up against in any game. Her horrible "creations" (cybernetic horrors constructed from a combination of robotic machinery and human corpses) are nearly as unsettling. In this dark and ominous game, the tension is quite palpable... you can hear your enemies in the dimly lit rooms and corridors of an *immense* starship, somnabulistically muttering things which will absolutely creep you out. The first time I heard a "Midwife" unit calmy muttering "Babies need fresh meat..." whilst she was murderously searching for me... BRRRRRRRRRR..!!! Let me out of HERE..!!! This game is simply dripping with creepy atmosphere that truly makes one feel all alone, and up against some seriously frightening nastiness. And the *excellent* audio effects add immensely to an already frightening, oppressive, and often frantic experience. I won't give anything else away. I'll simply give "System Shock 2" my "Best PC Horror Game Of All Time" award. If you can still find a copy of this game, grab it... as I believe it is no longer being produced. Also, a WARNING to parents: I do NOT recommend this game for young people. It is entirely too psychologically disturbing and graphic (especially if one downloads a patch available on the web which updates the graphics considerably). The patched version that I play contains quite a bit of partial nudity (topless and bloody Midwives), and extremely realistic gore. "System Shock 2" has an overall setting and storyline that are decidely adult in nature. Definitely not a game for kids, period. A big 5 stars, easily. A must have for any mature horror game addict.	1
I read the reviews on this game here on Amazon and decided to snap up a copy of this game. Oh Lord, what an experience! Others here have said they don't know how to classify this game. A strange amalgamation of First Person Shooter, RPG, and Horror game all rolled into one. And you thought it couldn't be done. Again as others have said before me, the closest I've seen to this game would have to be Half-Life. But within it are elements of Thief and a lot of the fear factor from AvP. You begin with the choice of one of three jobs: Marine (for weapons junkies), Navy Technician (computer hackers who electronically can finagle thier way through in lieu of fighting sometimes), and Psi soldier (who uses mental powers to eliminate threats, or to get around them). The atmosphere is incredibly eerie, and this game will induce a serious case of paranoia in you as you play. You'll find yourself jumping out of your chair when a harmless valve hisses next to you. Likewise your skin will crawl and your heart will literally gallop when you hear the sound of shuffling feet just around that corner in front of you... Graphics weren't really an issue for me. The character models aren't especially attractive but the action really makes it so that you don't mind. The big surprise to me was the quality of the ambient terrain. I wasn't expecting the surfaces of the Von Braun to look so detailed and even in today's graphics-driven gaming community this 6 year old game really holds it's own. The atmospheric sounds, be they dripping water, air vents, or the inane babbling of Xerxes are brilliant. Throw that in with the noises of the Many hunting for you, the sounds of footsteps, etc.....I spent a lot of time cowering behind crates afraid to look around the corner with my 1 remaining pistol round. And yet I couldn't stop playing. Multiplayer is a blessed throwback to the Doom era, where players don't compete at all, but rather go through the game cooperatively. I had my brother hooked on SS2 within 5 minutes and after a week we were both tackling the Many together, he as a Psi Trooper and myself as a seasoned Navy Tech. And it really helps alleviate the sometimes overwhelming loneliness of spending so much time in a game where everything not only wants to kill you but is sometimes so darned sneaky about it. Only AvP ever made me jump higher out of my chair than this game did, and to it's credit SS2 made you think a lot more than the former could. Take the time out of your life to play this classic out, and see what games today should be!	1
System Shock 2 is hard to categorize, because it blends several genres and styles of games so well. It's a Role-Playing First-Person Shooter Science Fiction Survival/Horror game, with some extra twists here and there. If you wished Half-Life was more like Deus Ex, or you wanted to play the more violent and scary parts of Thief with 22nd century firepower, this is the game you want to play. Though it's getting a bit dated now, this game was far enough ahead of its time to still be very playable. Where the original System Shock made history as a remarkably immersive story-driven first-person shooter, the sequel goes even further with complex character development elements usually only seen in role-playing games. The graphics scale up smoothly enough to still look impressive on today's faster, higher resolution (and higher polygon count) displays, the sound is of sufficient quality to still be just as effective as most newer, more technically advanced productions, and of course, a great story is never obsolete. Once you get into a game this immersive, you forget about the technical details that may no longer be as cutting-edge as they once were. Just turn off the lights, plug in your headphones (or surround-sound if you have it), and try to stay alive. If you happen to forget that it's just a game, this one can really scare you. Definitely not for the faint of heart. The biggest flaw in this game is that the developers just didn't have enough time to fully flesh-out and polish some of the later parts.  Certain areas are just less expansive and detailed and finely-tuned than others.  The game doesn't significantly suffer from what's missing.  It just could have been that much better. By far the most common complaint about this game is that the weapons break too fast.  Personally, I don't consider that a flaw.  I like the extra stress factor of having to keep an eye on the condition of my weapons.  Unlike most First-Person Shooters, your resources are very limited in this game.  Throughout most of the game, you will very rarely have enough ammo to stop worrying about making every shot count.  There are a limited number of weapons available, and if you keep firing one until it jams, you have to either expend other resources to fix it or deal with the fact that you have one less gun to work with. If you really don't like worrying about broken weapons, there is a way to reduce or completely disable weapon deterioration.  It's not a menu option you can switch on and off within the game, but the release notes file on the CD explains how to do it, and it's not difficult. One complaint I've heard about the end of this game is that there are two "final battles" at the end, and the second one is disappointingly easy.  I didn't feel that way because I recognized that the first final battle was the climax, and then when there was one more confrontation after that, I thought of it as more of an epilogue than a challenge.  This is something gamers just aren't used to, and the only other game I've played that had an "epilogue" after the final confrontation was Half-Life, which has been accused of having the worst ending of any game ever.  The ending of System Shock 2 isn't nearly that bad, but it can be disappointing if the relatively short final areas have left you expecting more. Unfortunately, due to the particular circumstances of the closing of the company that developed the game, Looking Glass Studios, it is very unlikely that there will ever be a third System Shock game.	1
I never cared about multiplay for this game, I don't mind the difficulty (in fact I enjoyed it), and I thought the graphics were fine (especially for when it was released).  Having been a huge System Shock 1 fan, I was first in line (pretty much literally, too) to buy this sequel when it was released, and for the most part I absolutely loved it. Now let me qualify "for the most part".  That means everything until about three major levels before the end, at which point the game completely buried itself.  To this day, I even remember the specific point at which I realized it had passed the point of non-redemption: where you found several very tall columns sliding up and down that were supposed to be (ahem) "teeth", and you had to jump across them a la 80's side-scroller.  The ending of this game (along with the couple of levels immediately preceding it) was so incredibly god-awful that I have to ding not 1, not 2, but *3* stars.  It it just that bad. An ending this bad, that ruins what was a masterpiece of a game leading up to it, is nothing new in computer games.  In fact, one of the highest-profile examples of it is quite similar to SS2, and that is Half-Life.  Now, if you're the type that's able to overlook a game's ending and enjoy just portions of the journey for their own sake, then you'll likely enjoy this game more than 2 stars' worth.  However, if you're like me and can think of few game design sins worse than a horrible ending, than my rating stands.  SS2 started out as one of the best sequels I'd ever played, and ultimately ended as one of the most disappointing.	-1
I initially gave this game a horrible review because it's so slow starting off and weapons and ammo are few and far betwen, but I have to eat my previous words now, as I love this game. It has playability very similar to Deus Ex, it's also a long game which is always a plus in my books.  It is possible to use a God mode on this game, though it does take a few minutes and some patience to create the user file to make it work.  Gte this game , it rocks!	1
Quite simply, System Shock 2 is the greatest PC game ever, at least in my opinion.  There are many similarities to Half-Life in terms of gameplay, but Half-Life, as good as it is, pales in comparison to this masterpiece from the now defunct Looking Glass Studios.  The atmosphere of this game is nothing short of incredible.  The experience is as immersive as its two-dimensional constraints allow.  You don't just run and shoot your way through this one.  You have to examine everything, from the ceiling to the floor, and there is a wealth of items to examine, pick up, gain information from, and use.  Controlling your character takes a little getting used to, given the spatial elements of the game.  I use the old Magic Carpet method--right hand on the mouse and left hand on the arrow keys.  Some folks have said the game is able to generate real scares; I can't say it really scared me, but there were a few times that it made me jump.  When one of those hybrids sneaks up on you from behind and moans in your ear, it can indeed be rather startling. The AI is just superb--these creatures don't just stumble around haphazardly; things come at you from directions you don't expect.  If you allow security to be alerted to your presence and can't get to a security station, you better find yourself a corner and try to look in every direction all at the same time until the alert ends. This game could not be as great as it is without a great storyline.  While players of the initial System Shock may immerse themselves a little easier in the gameplay, new gamers will quickly be pulled into the world of the Von Braun.  It's classic sci-fi, in my opinion.  If you are worried about getting through the game quickly and relegating it to your "games I will probably never play again" stack, dispense with your fears.  The System Shock 2 universe is huge, and it will take you untold hours to see the game to its very end.  On several occasion, I thought the game was about to end, but it just kept going and going.  If you do finish it, you may very well want to start all over; you can choose any of three different types of characters, so you can get three different experiences guaranteed.  I hate to think how many hours of sleep I have missed playing this game; you just can't pull yourself away from it without an effort. As some reviewers point out, this game can be pretty difficult.  The first two-thirds are not really too bad but may well take you a long time to complete; the final one-third of the game does get downright arduous, though.  I'm the kind of wuss that can only play on the easiest level, and I can't see how anyone can finish this game without cheating--I can't even imagine how impossible a task it must be to play at the highest difficulty level.  I don't endorse cheating, but I was so anxious to see more of the game that I had to resort to dastardly measures.  Toward the very end, I sadly had to resort to God mode; had I not, I would be spending a number of years trying to finish this game. Play System Shock 2.  (...)This may well be the best value in all of gaming.  Don't worry about the fact this game was produced way back in 1999; it stands up to and surpasses any other game I have seen on the market today.  I really cannot understand why this game was not one of the biggest sellers in history.  I read nothing but rare praise from critics in the business (unheard of ratings like 97 out of 100),  and the game actually lives up to its promise.  The sales figures of the original System Shock were disappointing, but the lack of popular acclaim for this sequel is tragic.  The fact that Looking Glass Studios is now no longer in existence is heartbreaking because it means there will probably be no System Shock 3.	1
This game has many positive aspects as detailed by other reviewers, but was just too violent for me. I found the images of severed heads and limbs disturbing. While the game does have some good strategy elements and character development, in the end it is a first person shooter and your main activity is killing. The plot was very good and kept my going long enough to finish the game. I guess I should stick with Lucas Arts titles.	-1
This game oozes with intense atmosphere.  It is wonderfully balanced and includes some of the best gameplay to date. The mechanics of the game work as an action-RPG.  You have several attributes and several skill categories.  The attributes includes speed, endurance, strength, etc.  Each has a very noticable effect on your character.  You inventory and melee damage increase with strength, your character moves faster with a higher speed, etc.  It makes for a different play experience based on how you choose to develop your character.  You can run through with guns a blazin' or develop a sneaky hacker.  In addition to weapons and technological skills, you can also develop psionic powers if you choose. The sound is also phenominal.  You can hear the tormented moans of your enemies as they walk around.  Using a four-speaker setup or preferably headphones really enhances the fright-factor as well. The character interaction is very minimal.  You find audio-logs of the dead crew as your explore the ship.  You will also witness ghostly apparations of the recently deceased.  While some thought it was empty, I felt it was right in tune with the rest of the game.  It really drives home the feeling of aloneness, helplessness and desperation of struggling against an awesome unknown enemy.  The other interaction you will receive is from the main computer on board the ship.  It also contributes greatly to the atmosphere. Do yourself a favor and play this game.  Play it several times.  It is one of the better games to be produced, period.  Then pick up Deus Ex for an equally engaging experience.	1
If you put Thief in a blender with the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey, a touch of the movies Event Horizon and Dawn of the Dead the result might be System Shock 2.  It's an RPG/Action hybrid. The graphics and animation were knock-your-socks-off gorgious when this game originally came out (1998 I think).  They still hold up well.  Each level is a treat to behold.  It's not quite half-life but close! The creatures you'll encounter get a little repetitive and the levels begin to get a little less creative 3/4 the way thru.  But for 10 bucks it's no big deal (actually this game is worth much more).  The game always has a thick atmosphere. I have yet to finish the game even though I've had it for several years.  This is one I play when nothing else suits me.  It's hard to believe this game wasn't a big commercial success.  It was on many  "Best of" lists.  Buy it! Two gripes:  the creatures multiply when you save your game too much and the radiation spiders suck!	1
The only game harder than this is the ridiculously difficult "Aliens vs. Pedator" (that's right, hardcore gamers, play it on the "extra hard" setting). S.S.2 is too freakin' hard for its own good. Not to brag, but I am very good at games like this but C'mon already!  "It's so creepy" - Yeah, especially when enemies appear from nowhere and smoke you quicker than a lightning bolt.  "But you have guns and stuff" - that break 5 seconds after you use them and try finding ammo when you need it. Health Packs - finding them is one thing, having time to use them is another. "Wow, what great level desi-" BANG, CRUNCH!! oops, I got killed again. Sightseeing is not a good idea in this game. However, the game does come with an ample supply of cheat codes but you have to use them at the right time. Don't start typing in the code for extra health or ammo when trouble is about to start, its too late at that point. I managed to get through the game by stocking up on health, ammo and abilities at every opportunity. By "opportunity" I mean when I was crouched behind a steel storage box while an automated gun was blasting away in my direction. Get the picture?	-1
Square has done it again! They never cease to amaze me.  I have been a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series, and it keeps getting better. In this, the "final" installment on the playstation console, Square has gone out with a bang!  The graphics are the best I have seen on the playstation...proving that the developers and game designers are still pushing the envelope and trying to deliver a quality product. The game-play and depth of the game are awesome and engrossing.  From the first opening scenes you are pulled in and carried along on one fantastic ride!  Fans of the Final Fantasy series will love the "old school" elements, as well as some brought over from FF7 and FF8. Those not familiar with the genre or series will have no difficulty jumping on and learning from scratch...everything from the online stratgey guide to the in-game help will allow players of any ability to enjoy the game and its many surprises. This game is great and belongs in the game library of EVERY playstation and PS2 owner out there.  Buy this game and prepare for many sleepless nights trying to save the world.	1
In my opinion, the best Final Fantasy game. It's a little less grindy then most JRPGs of that era (but still does require some grinding). The storyline and characters are great. All the twists and turns in the plot are fantastic. The combat is pretty much the same as it has been since FF4.	1
If you you want a Fantasy in Final Fantasy get this game. When did Final Fantasy turn into Final Sci-Fi with FF 7 and 8? Buy 9 instead.	1
game is incredibly enjoyable. I'd say it's on a scale up from Final Fantasy VII (Which I also love) while going back to some of the Final Fantasy basics. The Cut scenes are plentiful and awesome. I love the different characters and how they are unique plot wise, and in their move set lists. I have two big gripes. First, the main character has a tail, and for some reason that freaked me out at first. I got over it the further I got into the game. Second is what I consider a design flaw. Essentially when you reach your equivalent of a limit break, you are forced to use it. This is a small issue in the game, and there are ways in which you can prevent your characters from reaching that status. Additionally you stay in the "Limit Broke" Status for several turns, being able to use special techniques during that time. This is definitely my second favorite Final Fantasy, (second to VII), even though I think from a technical perspective, this game is better. I Just Love This Game Am Now In The Nolrich Heights Going To Town.	1
Excellent item.	1
my kids like it	1
Not one of my personal favorites, but still a great game at a great price. If you're a fan of the older Final Fantasy games and you haven't given this one a try, you're missing out.	1
Great buy	1
Alright, so, quality control is that I'm sure if you purchase this it'll work seamlessly and you'll be very happy in that regard.  Though, the game, comparatively, is just about as ridiculous as they come in the Final Fantasy genre.  Don't get me wrong, I have played almost all the FFs out there as a comparison, and this one really got my goat the most.  The story is flimsy at best.  The depth of characters is fairly shallow and the story feels slapped together.  Considering it was conceived, produced, and thrown onto the shelves only a mere year after FFVIII, I wouldn't be surprised if the story WAS slammed together with very little effort.  You have your typical love story mixed in with attempting to save the planet, but many other FFs have this as well and we still love them. So, why the long face O, Reviewer?  Well, I'll tell ya.  Because the character development is weaker than a piece of paper soaked in water.  Even when you finally get Zidane, the main character's, background it falls short of pulling at the heartstrings.  Not wanting to give anything away here, so I'll stop on that regard.  It's just plain disappointing.  Not about where he's from or who he is, but the references to FFVII are heavy handed and, in this case, it feels boring.  The gameplay and controls are very similar and familiar to past Final Fantasy's and for that I am grateful.  Leveling up is typical and I actually quite enjoy the idea of equipping weapons and armor that allows you to use an ability while it's on, but also learn it at the same time.  That, to me, helped it to get an extra star.  It loses a star, however, by how the game shadows other FFs, as mentioned before.  The music, with few exceptions, are lacking tributes to past FFs and the graphics fall in the category of WORSE than FFVIII.  I understand that the producers wanted to hark back to the older FFs and how they played, but progression should be the name of the game, not half-hearted duplicates.  Thankfully, at least for me, the difficulty is not all that hard.  It's easily beatable in less than forty hours and you really don't need any ultimate weapons in order to beat the ever living crap out of the final bosses.  For me, I count this as a win, but for those of you that truly like the game it might be a slight disappointment as most FFs require double the amount of hours, plus some hair pulling battles that will leave you agonizing on how to kick ass.  Overall, I'm just disappointed in the effort.  There just wasn't enough TIME for this game to mature.  The story could have been better with excellent character development and story editing, but it lacked so supremely in this regard that it made my heart ache, especially after the triumphs of FFVII and FFVIII.	-1
So excited to play this game again! Disk are perfect! Hopefully it plays.	1

great series	1
The "cartoony" nature of this game makes the characters much more likeable, in my opinion.  The game has a better storyline and overall game play than FFVIII, but the graphics are about on par with it.  Definitely worth a play-through.  Vivi is my favorite character out of all of the FF line.	1
Still my favorite Final Fantasy game.	1
worked fine, great game, my son loved it	1
great	1
Final Fantasy IX is the first Final Fantasy I have played. And though I haven't tried the rest yet, I actually wonder if this game will always be my favorite in the series. It's just that good. It has it all. A fantastic ability system, a truly enjoyable cast, a wonderful score, very detailed graphics, beautiful FMVs, lots of little references, and many delightful quirks. It's pretty funny too. This is one of the best RPGs and games in general I have ever played.  There are short vignettes called Active Time Events. These give insight into what other characters are doing at the time. It's a great way to expand the world and develop the characters. Watching these and the cutscenes are just as entertaining as playing the game.  I love the fantasy atmosphere and steampunk aspects. It feels like a real world, and you get to explore the whole thing. There's an exciting and adventurous feel to it all. One of the best parts is just roaming around town talking to people and finding items.  The music is worth the price all on its own. It's light and jubilant and intense and exciting and soft and melodic and warming. Very solid all around. "Song of Memories" might be my favorite video game track.  One thing I do dislike is the overabundance of random encounters. They went a little overboard. Practically every screen in the game contains them. But that's my only major complaint.  Like all the main numbered games in the FF series, this is a stand alone title. You don't need any backstory or prior experience to play.  I absolutely love this game. Looks great, sounds great, plays great, is great. Has a very engaging story with many characters that are easy to love. Even outside the spells, it's a very magical experience. A game full of wonder and joy and warmth. Highly recommended to all. One of the best games ever made probably. It's certainly my favorite.  -Tickles	1

Fantastic JRPG	1
Very cool.	1
Enjoyable, but not the best in the series. I was glad to see final fantasy go back to the medieval roots of the series with this release, but feel that, overall, the story and characters didn't feel as important as those in FFVI or FFVII.	1
this game is a replicated copy. All ps1 games are on a "black disc". this was on a regular cd rom. the game does work on the PS1 but just be warned its not an authentic copy.	-1
cool	1
Another Masterpiece by Squaresoft FInal Fantasy 7,8,9,10 are amazing RPGS and should be played by everyone	1
This is propbably the second best final fantasy right behind VIII. The graphics i think are the best on the playstation	1
One of the best games I played as a child the story was amazing. The game play outstanding the style the graphics everything about this game blew me away.	1
Beautiful! Brand new!	1
Nostalgic.	1
Truly an amazing game. I wish there were more rpgs like the in today's modern gaming world.	1
Final Fantasy IX has an interesting cast of characters that all play a role in the grand story Leading to a bunch of twists and turns in the plot. Put them all together with a magnificent story full of surprise, humor, death, betrayal, and symbolism and you've got an adventure you'll never forget.  I get immersed in this world so easily. The great nations and cities, the airship traffic, the vast landscapes of the over world, they all come together almost seamlessly and create a vibrant place that you will never want to leave. The diversity of the towns and cities are great, and each one brings something different to the story and environment. You have your city of night, your city of perpetual rain, your great militaristic empire, your quaint country village, etc. The environment and the diverse different cultural differences in this fantasy world of Final Fantasy IX I believe is what really keeps me coming back for more and in every sense of the word its a true Fantasy world. Unlike other games such as Final fantasy VIII and VII which have a more cyberpunk metropolitan and or more realistic vision of a fantasy world. But I guess thats all personal preference, what you want to see portrayed and represented in the game.  The characters of Final fantasy IX have more of a charming chibi like appearance as opposed to early final fantasy games. But overall I think this looks a lot better than dull character designs of final fantasy VIII.  The characters can be somewhat stereotypical: you of course have your standard frail female white mage and your beefy dimwitted guard, but their interactions still are entertaining and involving to the highest degree. The characters imo as a whole probably do not live up to the complexity and sophisticated plot scenarios as seen in Final fantasy VI or VII but you will be engrossed in the story itself probably not to notice these minor clich moments. One of which is the romantic relationship between Garnet and Zidane, which imo is not a huge focus as it could have been, such as Final fantasy VII (aires and Cloud) or final fantasy VIIIs (Squall and Rinoa) The game itself has a lot of plot twist and unexpected turns that will keep you always wondering what is going to happen next in the story, although the ending is a typical ending that is not very original. But the many plot elements in the game leading up to that point are very interesting and much thought provoking that you will enjoy it.  I absolutely cant mention FF IX without talking about the extra features or mini games in the game. There is so much extra content in this game that it pretty much rivals or is close to Final fantasy XII in terms of content. There are just tons of little extra things you can do in the game, some of which I poured hrs upon hrs into, one of the really fun and popular minigames is the Card game called Tetra Master You might find yourself actually playing that more than the actual game xD. In fact partway through the story its actually required that you complete a tournament. Like final fantasy VIII whitch had a card game minigame that was challenging and interesting, I found IXs to be my most favorite personally. Literally it would take me an entire whole page to mention all of the extra features this game has. It has its own chocobo popular mini game where you have to go locate certain treasure around the world as Choco graphs, some of them can be a pain to find, but I found it rewarding and interesting, you get lots of items and even access to an optional super boss Ozma. There is a jump rope mini game, Frog Capturing with Quina, The hot and cold Chocobo mini game, you can even play black jack at the ending after the credits roll as a little Easter egg, you have to input some crazy button combination but its fun.  They even included a playonline strategy guide to promote the game, im probably one of the few people that actually is still in possession of this guide. I treasure it to this day there is no guide quite like it and it just no longer exists on the internet any more. It is around 400 pages in length but if you're a completionist, it covers everything, including some things that were very rare and deep buried secrets not seen anywhere else.  FFIX is in fact quite beautiful. This game represents the pinnacle of visuals on the playstation. The truly amazing thing about these visuals is that I feel they have more lasting power than most other FF games, whether they are of the age of sprites or the newer polygon models. The amazing CG sequences marveled me and left my mouth on the floor. The standard gameplay graphics are even something great to look at as is the all the extra content in the game. This is in every bit worth a purchase. The only thing i could probably mention that might put some people off is the different chibi like model characters, but if you can look past that and it doesn't bother you, then this game will have you suckered into its expansive environments and beautifully written fantasy story one of the most diversified character cast you'll ever come across in a final fantasy game.  Go out and Buy it! :D	1

One of the greatest FF games.	1
Not my favorite Final Fantasy, but I enjoyed it.  I bought this game like 10 years ago and I'm amazed that I can find this game at such a great price (remember buying this at GameStop used for almost $20 -rare game at the time and the front cover was cracked).	1
great game	1
excellent game	1
I love it ^_^	1
i love it. thank you.	1
The product came in excellent condition	1
As one of a Final Fantasy fan, this one is another must have.	1
Very fast shipping, and I love this game!!!	1
love it	1
fun	1
It came in great condition and for some reason I loved this game even after 13 years	1
Love this game.  Needed it for my collection.  No complaints.	1
Amazing game.  Fun to play but also surprisingly dark for what it looks like.  It's worth it!	1
Excellent condition	1
It isn't my favorite but its fun non the less. Its that love story between a rich royalty girl who wants out of that life and a thief boy who would not mind living her life. Its a sweet story that I did not really draw me. What drew me was the humour and the fact that Garnet was not all she believed she was. The mechanics of the classic FF games was a nice plus by each character having their own abilities.	1
This is the best Final Fantasy game ever made.  Best storyline and gaming system.  Now playable on PSP and Vita... portable gold.  No matter how you play it, you will be pleased.  By far the best role playing game I have ever played.	1
Love the game, came as described!	1
Final Fantasy 9 is without a doubt one of the best games ever made. For less than $20, its a freaking steal!	1
awesome game	1
This game is good and the storyline is good too. It follows a theif who wants to steal the princess Garnett a bunch of stuff goes down and she wants to be kidnapped. There's a bunch of fun exploring to do also and mini games like a card game make it unique. And a good psone final fantasy with decent enought graphics and very nice cut scenes ! Give it a try	1
Awesome seller. Everything as described. I highly recommend buying from this seller again.	1
it came in on time and works great	1
superb	1
My second favorite FF on PlayStation One.  A classic in my opinion.	1
God it is the best JRPG ever mad. I can cry and cry about the story. When I first played it 14 years ago. I was shocked and thrilled. Literally, literally, literally I felt this game could be a game that I was asked to make if I had to.  Characters: memorable and cute and with profound souls. Music: the best!!!! will not be beaten by any other music, not even Beethoven's. Story: the most exciting and touching one. incisive description about every detail.  I have bought the English Discs and English digital version and Japanese digital version.  It is the only game that I can say I love.	1
my child really enjoyed the game	1
DOES NOT WORK ON PLAYSTATION 2	-1
Great game from the PS1 that can by used on the PS2 with the right card.	1
thank you	1
Final Fantasy IX is, to me, the best Final Fantasy game and the pinnacle of the series before it started to decline after FF10.  I'll break this down into pros and cons (not very many of the latter):  Pros: -Story: one of the best aspects of this game. It is presented and executed perfectly, with ample plots twists, drama, romance, action and excitement. It starts off sort of throwing you into it, not really sure of the point, but it all comes together in the end, leaving few to no plot holes or questions left unanswered -Writing/dialogue: another amazing part of this game. Whoever wrote the English script is a GREAT writer. It is so well done you can hear each character's voice within the writing (not just main characters but everyone you encounter). -Characters: the characters are all unique and very well developed. There are no boring, soulless characters, such as Vaan in 12. Each is memorable, even if memorable in a bad way. Each has his or her own backstory and issues to deal with. -Great UI and easy to learn: this is something that Final Fantasy games have always been great about doing -Medieval setting: I prefer this to the futuristic direction that Final Fantasy was taking previously -The backgrounds of the environments are beautiful -The FMVs are amazing, action-packed and the best in the FF series -The spell animations are some of the best in the FF series (e.g. flare, doomsday, Bahamut, etc) -Combat: combat is simple and easy to learn yet still very fun. There are a TON of pieces of equipment in the game and the support ability customization can be fun and strategic (though at times game-breaking). The characters are all different with unique abilities (and not samey like they are in FF8) -Music: superb music by Uematsu -Environments and level design: environments are big enough to let you explore (not too linear) but still maintain enough linearity for a strong plot -Treasures: there are a lot of treasures and secrets to find in this game, hidden in every corner of the world (in chests or with the '!' icon). I LOVED searching for these and finding them. It's something no other FF game does quite like this one. -Side quests: there aren't a ton of side quests in this game but quality over quantity, they are very well done. I love the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. It is so basic yet very addicting, sort of like a treasure hunt (and the treasure rewards and exceptional in some cases)  Cons: -Gameplay in FFIX is poorly balanced. Many bosses are a complete joke while others are extremely difficult and luck-based. Still, it's not anything too serious, it can just be a little annoying. -Tetra Master is, imo, not the greatest card game and a downgrade from FF8's Triple Triad. Still, it can be fun if you just want to collect the cards! -Fairly ugly character graphics but this is due to the age of the game	1
This game is pretty incredible, and much different from VIII or X. It is very restrictive in that you have a summoner, a healer, a black mage, a theif, etc. The story draws you in and the art is cartoonish but beautiful. The battle system is smooth and a revamped overdrive system gives each character a unique set of abilities. Active Time Events are introduced and while they are not always important they are fun and entertaining. Expect something closer to FF VII and not FF VIII.  P.S The card game in this game is soooo good - side quests are also still just as numerous.	1
While the art style won't appeal to everyone, the combat system is decent. One of the more irritating problems is nearish to the end areas are enemies that have specific strengths and status ailments. In other words, you'll be messing around your menus everytime you swap areas to avoid very cheap deaths. Story kinda jumps the rails around that point too.	1
It might not be 7 or 8 but it is still a good game and I am happy to join it to the collection.	1
This item arrived in good shape and in good time. I haven't had a chance to play it yet, but am looking forward to it!	1
Buy this game, just buy it. It is quite possibly one of the most important games of our generation. The story and characters are second to NONE. The music is amazing and the fighting system is simple enough for everyone to enjoy yet complex if you wish it to be. Again I cannot stress this enough, if you have never played it try it even if you aren't into RPG games.	1
If you know my reviews then you know then I am an anime & RPG fanatic. Final Fantasy 9 was by far one of my favorite games for the original Play Station device. I went out of my way to find a old PS just so I could play this game after I bought it. It is a 4 disc  story line they requires a lot of concentration but it is very enjoyable for every gamer out there.	1
I only recently got this game and I think it is fantastic It has: Witty writing Great soundtrack Bright and colorful Graphics Memorable characters easy battle system (no junctions if you weren't a fan of it from FF8 just simple leveling up)	1
Couldn't believe how cheap this game was when purchased! Having to fight sibling to be able to play, one step closer to collecting all Final Fantasy games!	1
This copy came in great condition. The game itself is a must buy. Way better than Final Fantasy VII or VIII.	1
Beautiful Game. It's just that this game gives you the worst directions EVER for you to follow and then expect you to find it while throwing a random battle at you every 3 seconds that you walk. Annoying as hell.	-1
"Baw baw baw what am I?" ~ Vivi  Cool game, I like that it went back to the adventure fantasy of earlier final fantasies.	1
I don't have a lot to say about this game because i feel the best reviews should be sought at review sites, but the story, characters and gameplay are all on par with what you would expect from a PS1 era Final Fantasy game and this is one game that should not be skipped!	1
I have been playing FF for years.. and LOVE every single one of them, best RPG series out there, Amazing Story lines an Game play.	1
I have owned this game before when I was a teenager. I grew up so to speak but now have a free time to pursue a hobby. Playing this game is even more enjoyable now then I remember when I was younger. If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII this will not let you down.	1
Final Fantasy IX is a great re-visit for fans of the series or anyone playing it for the first time. This game is one of the favorites of many fans thanks to the storyline. The battle system is similar to other entries in the system.	1
IX is one of the very best in the series, and is right up there with VI, VII, and IV. Great story, characters, graphics(especially those spell effects) and gameplay. The battles are a bit slow, but once you get auto-haste, the speed is perfect. The battle speed is the only thing I can think of to nitpick about; this game is absolutely fantastic.  IX was the swan song for classical FF; I wish Square-Enix still made games of this style & quality. FFX is a good game, but IX is superior in every way imo. I'm very happy to have a replacement for my old, broken copy so I can replay this masterpiece.	1
Whenever my friends ask why I like this game so much, I can usually only spit out a four word response, which is "It's just plain fun."  But there is more to it than that. You have a story that is packed full of emotions, you have abilities and skills and what could overall be the best looking game to be released on the original Playstation.  I would highly recommend this game for anyone looking to get into Final Fantasy for the first time.	1
Shame on anyone who doesn't make this a 5 star 10 out of 10 easily number 1 next to Final Fantasy X this is a beautiful piece of work I love it and any true Final Fantasy will too	1
This is my favorite Final Fantasy.  Most people say Final Fantasy 7 is but this  brings you to a time when Final Fantasy just came out and then adds a new feel and graphics!	1
Final Fantasy IX would've been great. But there is something very stupid and annoying about it. The steal rate is very low, like 1% chance success rate. If I knew this, I would've never bought the game. The game would be badass without it. It is a waste of the player's life.	1
this was my first FF game, since i stoped playing video games after the NES, I played it on my PS2 (the second sistem i had), I bought it again, since the first disk of my original copy didn't work any more. I'm going to try it on my ps3.  This game its a great return to the old school FF games, the last FF game on the PSone.  Edit  Game doesn't work on my ps3, on different parts of the game, when changing stages it freezes, on the black screen with the music still playing. (this seems to be a know issue with the emulator on the ps3, but sony's solution is to download the digital copy from PSN.	1
Final Fantasy IX is a really fun game to play. I've probably played it over at least three times but things feel almost new every time I start over. I'm glad it hasn't received the same following as FF VII. This game is quite a bit easier than the two that came before it. This game is the last of the Final Fantasy series I would buy (Squaresoft or bust) and I didn't like X or X-2. I hope Square Enix remakes games 1-9 with HD graphics. This game is probably one of the easiest, if not easiest, game to play in the Final Fantasy franchise.	1
loved it but if ppl want to write a book then thats on them but we shouldnt have to put this much on feed back	1
Bought this straight from amazon and it was apparently brand new as it was wrapped in plastic! Worked great of course~	1
This is my favorite final fantasy game, good price for a great game! Defiantly one to add to your collection if you love final fantasy!!	1
Bought the game from Amazon Warehouse Deals in Acceptable condition for $2.xx.  Discs and original case and art were flawless. It didn't include the instruction manual (I didn't expect it to, because of the condition), but for the price I got it, can't complain.	1
I was recommended to play this game by a friend.  I was looking for a solid RPG to play, and to be honest I haven't play this Final fantasy or FF8 either lol.  I was kinda bored to be honest about this game at first, but holy crap it took off fast :).  I immediately loved Vivi as a character.  I don't know why but he was awesome :), and I am glad I got to play with him the whole time.  Pros  1.  I loved all of the characters in the game especially Vivi.  The character development was amazing and nothing can be said horrible about it 2.  Kuja as a villian was great.  He had this aristocrat feeling to him and he was so vicious as the angel of death. 3.  Their was plenty of side quests and optional bosses to fight against especially Ozma.  Ozma was in a league of his own.  No other boss could compete with this guy.  I had all of the ultimate weapons and suit up armor and level avg 80 and still got my butt handed to me.  I basically had to get frog drop and dragon crest up to 9999 to take this guy down.  I hate that curse spell. 4.  The story was beautiful and had a great ending.  Cons  Nothing was wrong in this game.  Overall, this game was great and definitely filled a void that needed filling.  The only thing I regretted that it had to end.  10/10. GAME ON	1
I've been looking for this game for years and bought it before at a store for $35 only to return it since it was really scratched up. I got this game for only $15 and its practically brand new! Now to get a memory card for the playstation so I can actually save this game.	1
I have never been a heavy video gamer, but this year i decided to get back into a little bit of gaming and i decided PS1 RPG's were the best place to start! Mind you i haven't played video games for years, but i found FFIX's graphics to be more than satisfying. The game overall is tons of fun. The characters are all very interesting and the battle system is loads of fun. There is very little to look down on this game other than the story. The plot is TERRIBLE, constantly shifting with no reason. At times the story gives me no reason to go on. Inside Disc 1 and 2 we go from saving the princess to having to fight the evil woman beatrix, who then joins our side, then we have to fight queen brahne, who gets killed by kuja, and now we have to fight kuja, but kuja is overpowered by his real boss in the sky who takes his summoning dragon. The plot is worthless. Fortunately the game is tons of fun, and the characters individual story lines are interesting. Cheers!	1
Excellent article! I recommend it to all 100%. . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . .	1
Absolutely a must have for any Final Fantasy fan. This game added to what was a great run of games from squaresoft during the original Playstation's life!	1
I love that you can name you're characters, and the game isn't easy. It takes time, effort, etc. You must work for it. I love it.	1
I have been a fan of the FINAL FANTASY series since the NES version. I like this one especially since it has a lot of 'old school' game play and cutesy characters but also has integrated the card playing trading battle games and massive world to explore. I do not however care for the princess in this game .She is kind of annoying and your mage 'looks' like Orco from HeMan :) But great game if you are a fan of the series!	1
I have always liked this game.  It has something of the old final fantasy feel, but it also has much of the new.	1
item came on time in excellent condition great service hope I can do business with this seller again highly recommended!	1
This game really demands no review. Its fantastically written, has some of the best art of its generation, and is still held in higher regards to gameplay and polish over many of the more recent titles in the franchise. FF VII, IX, & X are still the best games in the franchise. Nothing that SquareEnix seems to put out these days is capable of being able to hold a candle to their classic PSX and PS2 cult classics.	1
This is 9 in a series of 10. Great roll playing game....get the whole series. Could be a collectors edition.	1
great final fantasy game and a piece of gaming history must have for all fans and collectors great final fantasy game and a piece of gaming history must have for all fans and collectors	1
To me this was my favorite Final Fantasy. Yes like all the others it has problems but to me I loved the style of graphics, its not a realistic as 8 but a different style similer to ratchet and clank now which i also love. The story was very intresting to me and kept me wanting to explore the other regions and places. It made me wanting to advance my characters to get them stronger. Yes it as problems. Final Fantasy 7 had materia, 8 had junctioning, 9 seemed to be missing a little. You learned the abilities through the weapons and armor you equip and eventually you will master that ability, I believe they could have done more to the battle system to make this one more different than the others. The other problem I had with this one is that at a certain point near the end you can't revisit locations, you are basically forced to go on to the end of the game and I enjoy doing the side quest so I also felt like they could have t=done this differently.  However I absolutely loved this version and remains my favorite one, yes I have played  almost all of the Final Fantasy's and I am working on beating the ones I haven't like 5 and 6. This one to me just captured me with the story, characters, and graphics and will most likely remain my favorite.	1
First, the bad: the graphics do not stand up well on an HDTV, and the game is in dire need of autosaves Every thing else, however is great, and really engages you in the story.	1
Got the game brand spanking new.. at a good price. Can't argue with that.  this game is old but one of the best ever made.	1
Final Fantasy IX is a great installment to the series.  In particular the story is what is highlighted here, and you get a lot of story.  However, it lacks in other elements and definitely does not deserve a five star rating.  So I was a little late playing this one, I just beat it 10 minutes ago, unlocking all skills, weapons, and subquests.  All in about 105 hours.  So I guess I guess I'd consider myself a hardcore RPG guy and this was one of the few FFs (along with 2 and 3) that I haven't got to yet.  And let me say I am quite pleased with a lot that this game offers, but I still couldn't stand some aspects of the game so let me break it down by story, gameplay, animations, and extras.  STORY. If the game was rated solely on the story, 5 stars easily.  While I can't say it was the best of FF, it was just an overall solid intriguing story.  It DOES start extremely slow (and you might be like WTF is this), but the story picks up/ gets better as you progress.  Even the ending satisfied me.  One thing I didn't like was that it was a little excessive.  Sometimes you could press select to see a different thing happening at the time.  Usually these things were extremely insignificant, and it happens A LOT.  The characters were okay, but with their animation and choice of wardrobe, it was sometimes hard to take them seriously.  I will discuss that later, but I also kind of wish the characters were a little bit more mature.  I loved their personalities, but c'mon the princess is only 16, she's jail bait for crying out loud.  One other thing I didn't like about characters was that some of them didn't really have a major part in the story.  There could have been more to some of the characters in subquests, but not the case.  GAMEPLAY. Another important aspect.  But I wasn't as fond of the gameplay.  What I didn't like was the leveling up and "trance".  For leveling up, it's so difficult to find good grinding spots, and it takes so long to level up.  Also, I finished the game at level 94 for Zidane and he only had about 6000 HP.  Another thing is how damage is conducted.  I obtained the summon Ark from the subquest toughest boss in the game which was extremely time consuming, and after a 5 minute cinematic presentation, it only causes about 7000 damage to regular enemies. Ugh, the Knights of the Round in FFVII would be laughing.  Trance was another issue.  Yea so it's like a limit break, okay, but you just barely ever get to use it.  Instead of activating trance whenever you want, it automatically happens, which sucks because the battle is usually over by the time you get it and the gauge starts over.  I didn't even get to use all the special attacks from Zidane's trance, in fact I think I only accessed it like three times.  That's a definite step back from FFVII's limit breaks or even (dare me) that of VIII.  ANIMATION/DESIGN. What was square thinking with the design? This was the reason I never was drawn to playing it all those years.  The characters just looked too goofy or cartoonish.  To my expectation and dis, it WAS actually hard sometimes taking the story seriously with the cartoony animations (Zidane is a midget for crying out loud).  And what is with the choice of wardrobe.  The princess wears an orange jumpsuit, Steiner wears what looks like a Halloween knight's costume, and Kuja really ticked me off by wearing some weird outfit that looks like something a hooker would wear as some type of fetish thing.  Idk.. I really wish Square made a better effort to give the characters the animations they deserved. Look at Zidane in Dissidia, he's more life-like.  SUBQUESTS/EXTRAS. Subquests were okay, but I think they could have been a lot better.  This is where I spent all my time on, including leveling up to beat optional bosses.  The chocobo mini game and treasure hunt, I found to be very fun.  But unfortunately that's pretty much all I can say.  Other subquests were very hard to find, very insignificant and not really part of the main story line.  So just overall definitely okay, but at the same time, definitely lacking.  BOTTOM LINE. So Final Fantasy IX to be brief is a step above FFVIII but a step below FFIX.  Don't listen to people who say it's incredible.  It's not. It's a great experience but if you're used to the greats like IV, VII, X, then you'll be pleased with this, but not blown away.  For me, I had low expectations, and was quite surprised.  So try it out, it's a little lengthier than previous FFs, but you'll probably like it, but I'm telling you it does have some faults.	1
God bless Square Enix. Where would nerds be without them? Final Fantasy IX is the best example of the JRPG genre yet made, a game that most everyone can enjoy. If one were to distill the essence of all those 90's RPGs into a single game and ratchet the quality as high as it could possibly go, this is what it would look like.  Final Fantasy IX follows the exploits of Zidane, a dude with a tail, as he and his partners in the travelling theater group Tantalus decide to kidnap the princess of the kingdom of Alexandria. A young black mage named Vivi gets involved as well, as does the princess' obsessive bodyguard, Steiner.  This simple plot description should begin to show you how Final Fantasy IX sets itself apart from other JRPGs while using the building blocks of the genre. Obviously, a kidnapped princess with an obsessive bodyguard is a trope familiar to anyone who has played an SNES-era RPG, but a travelling theater group? Another twist on the formula occurs when Princess Garnet requests to be kidnapped once she learns of the plan against her.  Throughout the game, many twists on these formulas culminate to create a product that's strangely familiar, yet completely new. Final Fantasy IX has a great villain, as well, contrasting Final Fantasy VIII's disappointing Ultimecia. Other twists on famous fantasy tropes exist too- two of the major characters, both knights, are female this time around, when most are male. The game offers a considerable challenge, too, though it doesn't mirror the frustrating difficulty of the pre-Playstation era of the series.  The game's ability system strikes a pretty good balance between customization and individuality as well. Final Fantasy IX features an "ability" system in which party members are taught abilities through their equipment. Since only certain characters can equip certain equipment, it leads to a diversity of abilities split between the diverse cast of characters. The system itself doesn't have any major problems; it works intuitively and helps to specialize the characters. In addition, the party can have 4 characters in it instead of 3. The more I play modern RPGs, the more I wish another one would attempt to up that number again.  If the game has a major flaw, and I think it does, it's that of the eight playable characters, there is an obvious party of four that the game seems to want you to play with. While the game doesn't force you into playing with these characters after a certain point, deviating from the obvious choices makes the game unnecessarily difficult, and doesn't exactly "work." A little more balance amongst the characters could have gone a long way.  Since the four characters I'm referring to are so balanced as a party, you'll be playing through most of the game with them. This, for me, is far from a deal-breaker. Final Fantasy IX was a tribute to yesteryear ten years ago when it came out, and now it simply remains as one of the Playstation's best games. Since it can now be downloaded for $10 on the PSN, it's also one of the best games for the PSP. Anyone who has ever loved a JRPG owes it to themselves to play Final Fantasy IX.	1
I LOVE this game!  I maybe wouldn't go so far as to say it's the best Final Fantasy ever, but it's better than most of them.  Although, its soundtrack might be the best of any Final Fantasy game. I think the characters are interesting and fun, the gameplay is fun an interesting, the environments are cool, the storyline is epic but not predictable, all making a completely entertaining game that remains one of the best games of one of the best game serieses.  My only complaint is that the character design is a little cartoonish, but once you get past that, then it becomes a nearly perfect game.  It's certainly better (in my mind, of course) than FF 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 10-2, 11, 12, 13, 14, and maybe all of the non-numbered games.  If you haven't played it, I can't recommend it enough!	1
How do I start this review? One way I could start it is by going into detail about how great this game's story is, but is the story that great? Or are the characters what makes the game so interesting? I think it's the latter. The characters drive this game. Yes, the story is good, the battle system is good, the graphics are good (the best cinematics of the PS1), overall the game is great because you have all the goodness of a game plus great character development. As a FF fan, I know that the main character needs to be strong and that's exactly what Zidane is. OK, maybe not externally, but character wise he is strong. He doesn't have the inner turmoil of Cloud and Squall; he's outgoing, funny, and level-headed which are refresher traits for the main protagonist of the PS1 FF games. Toward the end of the game he does have a breakdown, however, it's warranted. Zidane isn't the only character that is developed. Every main character has a great story (I won't spoil them in this review), even the supporting cast are developed too, which doesn't happen often. Like I said earlier, the main story of the game, arguably, is taken from RPG story 101 class, but the writers took it from class and added their spice into the game making it a good read. The side-quests are a plus to this game too. I found the card game to be easier and more fun to play than the card game in FF8. The chocobos are fun to raise and mognet is a blast. That's another great thing about FFIX: moogles are everywhere, in fact, a moogle saves your game when you want to save your progress.  What makes this game great? -Great characters -Battle system (jobs, 4 team battle party,) -Side-quests (chocobo raising, mognet, card game, frog game) -Awesome cast of characters (main and support) -Awesome character design -Hidden weapons -Airships galore  What I didn't like about the game -The main problem of the story could have been better, but it's not a big complaint -Would like to have had a moogle in the party :)  Final Fantasy IX is my favorite Final Fantasy game (I've replayed it more than five times) and I like to revisit it not only for the characters, but just because the game is fun. There isn't one dull moment in the game and it has the perfect difficulty setting too.  This game is worth your time if you're a FF fan or if your new to Final Fantasy.	1
Final Fantasy ix is in my opinion the best final fantasy there is.  The characters seem a little more childish than other final fantasys, but don't let that drive you away.  You play as several characters and go through there lives including zidane, a thief that has a monkey tail and the hots for the princess, vivi, a cute shy mage who tries the entire game to discover his origins.  Princess Garnet, a princess with the power to summon all powerful eidolons, Steiner, the princess's knight in shining armor...sort of, as well as many others.  It is a classic turn based rpg.  There are so many things to love about this game.  The music for one, is so beautiful, i actually have the soundtrack and i can play some on the piano, ive never fell in love with the music of a video game like this one...especially the piece "loss of me".  Also there are tons of little items to find all over the land which makes you want to explore.  Many rpgs nowadays have great graphics such as when you enter a house but its just for looks theres nothing to find...not so with this game.  You also have a sidequest where you can collect cards and battle others in the game to win cards...kinda like pokemon or yugioh.  You have a tons of cool weapons and armor to get throughout the game and theres plenty of awesome abilities to learn and plenty of sidequests to complete so it will take you quite a while to complete this game.  It has a very intense story and the cutscenes are amazing and very captivating.  The story is amazing...you start out in what is like a medieval setting and towards the end you end up on another planet and you go all the way to the end of the universe even.  This is a great game for anyone who loves rpgs.  So if you haven't played this one, GET IT!! You won't be disappointed	1
I have the original version (PSX), but I halted on CD3 because the official guide sucks!!! (now I even can't retrieve codes from Square Enix or [...]!). Recently I checked PS Online and found this game and now it's for PSP! It is fun to carry it everywhere to fill up an hour of train ride. The only down side is: it's too addictive. You don't realize you spent a few hours a day just for playing the game! If you want a strategy guide, search it on internet for text-only version. Stay away from official guide!	1
Midway's Cart Fury is a great game.  This game plays alot like Midway's other arcade hit Hydro Thunder.  There are a few similarities such as secret paths, power ups, and it being incredibly challenging. There are quite a few differences, which are all good.  This game uses CART cars (open wheel/ Indy style race cars) with actual big name drivers that you can select such as Michael Andretti, Christian Fittapaldi, Adrian Fernandez, Max Papis, Bryan Herta, Gil de Ferran, and a few others. The graphics are absolutely stunning.  The sheer sense of speed is uncanny. Wait until you see cars explode and scatter debris on the track, right in front of you, this is extremely cool. The selection of tracks is large, and are very fun to race on.  The two player mode is a blast to play.  The Super Boost power up is too cool for words.  The soundtrack could have been a little better ( the song that plays during the menu selection will have you hitting the mute button on your TV temporarily). The mini games will have you playing this game longer, when you get bored with the single race or season modes.  There are also several things that you have to unlock in this game, that depends on how you finish in a race. Bottomline,  This game has excellent graphics, extremely fun gameplay, and great replay value.  You will keep playing this one for a long time, even after Gran Turismo 3 arrives in July. Highly Recommended!!	1
i picked up cart fury the other day and for the most part its a fun driving game. very arcade style game play. very easy to learn the controls. the graphics where pretty good too. there a little cartoonsih but nothing to bad. the only down side i saw too it (and its nothing big) i wish there was an replay mode after a race. i think it would be pretty cool to see diffrent angles of the race.   overall if your a race fan and you cant wait till gt3 comes out this should tide you over till then.	1
Final Fantasy IX is my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time! It's also my favorite video game of all time. When I played Final Fantasy X, I thought that it was the best Final Fantasy. For a few months, I believed that Final Fantasy X was the best because of how good the graphics, storyline and voice acting was. Then I played Final Fantasy VII and loved it more than any game ever. I always thought I'd love Final Fantasy VII the most. Then I played Final Fantasy VIII and it was then my second favorite Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy VII was still my favorite Final Fantasy. Then I wanted to try out Final Fantasy IX and heard mixed thoughts about it. I decided to try out my friend's game and from the opening FMV I really liked it. Then I decided to buy my own copy. It wasn't until my third game of Final Fantasy IX that I realized that I love Final Fantasy IX more than anything. Even Final Fantasy VII, which is now almost tied with Final Fantasy IX. After playing my third game of IX, I did start a fourth game and more and have played just about every Final Fantasy I THROUGH X-2, Final Fantasy XII-XIII, Tactics, Crystal Chronicles but IX will always be my favorite. Well here is why it's my favorite game of all time.  Gameplay: 10/10  The gameplay for Final Fantasy IX is my favorite out of all the Final Fantasy games I've played. It's a very cool system that I think is the best in the series. Every character is unique because not one character can learn the same ability. Everyone is different and that's one reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite. There are basic abilities like auto-haste that everyone can learn but everyone has their own special abilities. Zidane is a thief and he can only have the steal and master thief ability. Garnet and Eiko are summoners and white mages but the summons are completely different and only a few of the white magic spells are different. Vivi is a black mage and he is the only one who can learn black magic. Quina is the only one who can learn blue magic, Amarant is the only one who can throw items and weapons, Freya is a dragon knight and has these cool dragon knight skills, Steiner is a Knight and he has a very unique and cool purpose when in the party with Vivi. Steiner can use magic sword. That means that when you command Steiner to use something like Fire Sword, Vivi will cast Fire on Steiner's sword so when Steiner goes to attack the enemy not only will he deal great damage with the sword, but also will deal fire damage. Steiner also has very unique sword abilities. In Final Fantasy IX, the characters learn abilities through equipment. You equip up to five different pieces of equipment and they have abilities that the characters can learn. In battle you gain experience points and Ability Points. Once a character has learned an ability, you can change their equipment to learn another ability and you'll keep the previous ability regardless what equipment you have on. The way you equip abilities is you get these blue stones which is limited by the characters level and every character has a different number of stones. This makes it so that you can't have every single ability equiped at once. As the characters' levels go up so does the number of stones which makes it possible to have more abilities equiped.  Also, the number of characters in battle has been brought back up to four. In battle, there is a wait bar that fills up and when it is filled, that character can take a turn. There is also a limit break system called Trance. A bar under the characters' wait bar fills up a little more each time the character gets hit. Every character has a different trance ability. Trance is a characters' devastating attack. There is also an ability to make the character go into Trance faster.  Another part of the gameplay is there is a ! symbol that pops above the characters' head whenever you find some treasure. You can have a curser appear whenever you enter a place but that can be turned off in the config menu.  Something that not alot of people know about is that two people can actually play this game. In the config menu, there is an option to having which characters' are controlled by which player. Two player is only used in battle. If controller one is set for a certain character then controller two is set for another character, only the person who is using that certain controller can use that character. There is no way one person can level up and the other person visit towns at the same time but it's still a unique feature of Final Fantasy IX that I didn't know about until my third game.  One more thing about the gameplay that's different from most Final Fantasy's. When Garnet or Eiko summons for the first time, you will see the full summon animation. After the first time only the full animation will be at random times. The only way to see a full animation all the time is to use the boost ability. But I usually have boost because I like watching the whole animation. Also, the shorter animation deals less damage.  Story: 10/10  The main reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite. The story is most interesting story i've ever seen in a video game. From the very beginning FMV to the end credits, the whole story is incredible. Never once was I bored with the storyline or leveling up. I have spent 13 or 14 hours at a time playing Final Fantasy IX because the story is so amazing and interesting. You have Zidane who is a thief and he's the main character of the game. Then you have Garnet who is a princess and she is also a summoner. Eiko is a young summoner. Vivi is a young black mage. Steiner is a Knight. Quina is a blue mage. Amarant is this fighter. Freya is a dragon knight. I'm not going to say a whole lot about the story because I don't want to ruin the game for anyone but I will say that this is most deepest, in-depth, engrossing game i've ever played. There are castles. There are dragons. There are Kings and Queens. There are chocobos. There are tons and tons of moogles that say Kupo! There is no voice acting in this game but Zidane, the main character, has more character depth, personality and character development than any other Final Fantasy's main character. I have seen so many different emotions throughout Final Fantasy IX than any other Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy IX is the most humorous game that i've ever played. I find myself laughing throughout at least 70 or 80 percent of the game. The characters in the party and even the NPC's are the most interesting and most funny that i've ever seen. People that say you need voice acting for more depth is wrong. Because I have played Final Fantasy IX four times now and have actually seen more in IX than any of the other Final Fantasy's. The story keeps you hooked from beginning to end. There were times where I just didn't sleep because I couldn't put down the controller. I totally love the story and it will always be my favorite of all time!  Sound: 10/10  The sound and music of the game is also the best i've ever heard in a Final Fantasy game. When a character attacks, you can hear the attack. Also magic and summons are very well done. I love the sound effects of the water, wind, lava, just everything you can think of has sound and it's amazing. This music in this game is the best music i've ever heard because not one track is ever out of place. You never go to an area and feel the music shouldn't be there. In fact, just about every area, cut scene, FMV has a different piece of music that some tracks you only once in the game. There were so many musical tracks for this game that they had to make five discs instead of just a four disc soundtrack. Because the four just has the basic music in the game but the fifth disc the FMV music. Nobuo Uematsu really put alot of effort into the music of Final Fantasy IX and it shows greatly. I love every piece of music in Final Fantasy IX and never get bored of it. The music totally fits the game perfectly. My favorite piece is "You're Not Alone" which is played near the end of the game and it's a powerful track when Zidane is feeling completely worthless.  "Rose Of May" is another favorite, it's so beautiful.  They even have a bunch of different chocobo songs. The same song just the tempo is different for each one. Even the music in Black Mage Village is a variant of the chocobo theme.  Awesome soundtrack! Also the moogles make a really cute sound.  Graphics: 10/10  The graphics for Final Fantasy IX is the best i've ever seen in a playstation game. The environments are so realistic looking that it's incredible. There are many places where you see water flowing and it's so smooth looking. The characters are also done awesome graphically. You can see alot of detail in the characters such as eyes blinking, the moogles pom-pom thing on their heads moving effortlessly, the way the camera will change to focus on a single character when it's their turn and of course the FMV's. The FMV's are the best FMV's i've ever seen. The way Vivi looks in the FMV's, you'd think he was real. You'd also think the moogles are real because if you really pay close attention you can see fur. I love the graphics of Final Fantasy IX.  One other thing about the graphics: The world map is the most incredible looking world map. There are castles which of course look cool from the inside but when you go out on the world map, you can see the castles perfectly. The castles look amazing from the world map. There is also a couple places with waterfalls and to just take a second to watch the waterfalls, the views are breathtaking. I'm not kidding. The world map is more than just a place to walk on, travel, ride chocobos. It's pure beauty. I love going out on the world map. The forests and mountains are also amazing. You can definitely tell that Squaresoft put tons and tons of effort into this game.  Side Quests: 10/10  Final Fantasy IX has got to be the game with the best side quests. I have found myself spending over 50 hours just doing sidequests and they are so fun and addicting. My all time personal favorite sidequest is the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. Not only do you get to ride a chocobo all over the world map but you get to play a treasure hunting game. There are a few different locations where you search in an area for treasure. Also you get to find treasure on the actual world map. And don't worry, you get pictures and hints so you're not running all over the world map trying to find a specific treasure for hours on end. There are tons of treasures including ultimate weapons to find in this amazing sidequest. AND, in this amazing game, the chocobos can get to actually fly!!  Yes, you get a flying ability and it really makes this game so unique because of this alone, let alone everything else.  There is also a really cool frog catching game, a jumprope game for Vivi and Eiko, a really fun and cool card game called Tetra Master which is alot more fun and easier to get the hang of than the card game of Final Fantasy VIII. There is also a coin sidequest which you get some cool items which one of them is needed to get an item for Final Fantasy IX's second ending. Yes Final Fantasy IX has two different endings. I love the sidequests. There are more than I listed but those are the best. Another reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite.  Good points:  Awesome, funny, deep, very in-depth storyline Awesome Graphics Incredible music and sound Fun sidequests amazing, most developing characters Very cool gameplay  Bad Points:  Nothing  Overall: 10/10  I know what you're thinking. You're wondering what is bad about the game. To be totally honest, I find nothing bad about the game at all. To me, it's perfection. To me, it's what Final Fantasy is supposed to be and whenever I think of Final Fantasy, I think of Final Fantasy IX. If I had to pick one Final Fantasy that was a true Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy IX would be it. Final Fantasy IX has everything I could possibly want out of a game. The way I feel about this game is like no other game. It's like Squaresoft made Final Fantasy IX just for me because there's not one thing in the game that I don't like. I love everything about it. To me, it's the perfect game.  Rent/Buy: Buy  Buy this game right away if you don't have it and play it if you do have it and just haven't played it yet. Trust me, you will not regret it. This game is a must have for any Final Fantasy fan. If you love the old-school Final Fantasy's then you'll love this and if you are not really into old-school, this game is sure to change your mind. Please go out and buy this game. It will be the best buy you've ever made!  Replay Value: Very High  What I am about to tell you is very important so please, please take my advice. I have played Final Fantasy IX four times now and have realized a very important element that's not really been used before in Final Fantasy. I decided to use different characters for different party's, situations in my third game and seen something very exciting. The dialog changed. For instance, when I used a character the guide suggested, certain dialog came up. When on my third game, I decided to use different characters for the situations and found that I got more story than just using the same characters for some of the situations. And you'll know in the game when they ask you to pick a certain party. Also since this game has two endings it's definitely worth replaying.  The number one reason I am stressing to play this game multiple times is I didn't find out alot of a characters' past until I replayed the game and I was on my third game. Trust me people, play this game at least four or five times. You always find out more in a replay game. And you understand more and more each time you play. I know this from experience. The only way to fully experience everything and get the most story is to play Final Fantasy IX multiple times and for me I love the game so i'll probably end up playing it as long as I can for years to come. Bottom Line: Best Game Ever!!! Thank you Squaresoft!! You've outdone yourselves.	1
This game was awesome. Graphically it was gorgeous for the PS1 platform and the sound was well designed, too. Very whimsical and lighthearted in its design which made this very refreshing for the franchise. It was nice to play a Final Fantasy game that was not as dark and serious as some of it's predecessors (i.e. FFVII). This one lengthy game that definitely will warrant being played more than once.	1
The graphics are amazing because its on the PLAYSTATION 1 !, the gameplay is great but the story kind of bores you at times but it does not effect the game too much , over all I would buy this game and I regret ever selling my copy !	1
for a playstation 1 game this game is awesome theres plenty of sidequests and mini games ,hidden bosses,hidden items just an awesome rpg and 4 disks long but now onto the bad news the battles are very long and slow it makes replay value very low but if you can get passed the slowness its an amazing rpg.on a sidenote if your a rpg gamer youve might have notice the main character is a silent guy with immotional issues about being abbandon well not this main he's a bit of a perv on 1 hand its a nice change of pace but it can get kinda downright creepy but not enough to not play.	1
I kept passing this game up at the store and on-line. I just wasn't sure it would live up to its description. Man, was I so wrong! I am glad that this game "haunted" the back of my mind so much and made me buy it. The story-line is fantastic. The puzzles and reasoning are perfection. I really felt for the characters in this game. Some I still wonder about as if they were real. Evil and Good....or as they say,"force and counter-force." I wanted to see everything and be everywhere in this carnival of Dreamland. There were no glitches at all and the game ran so smoothly. I love the 360 degree viewing and the graphics were outstanding. This is a very mature game. The content is over PG-13 rating in a few areas. After I finished, (satisfied yet, sad that it was over) I immediatley went to the software site to see if there was any chance of a sequal. One of my top ten Adventure Games!	1
Love this game. Again Awesome. You won't be disappointed on any of the Final Fantasy games. Happy gaming! Great Characters And aging great graphics. You'll have to ck this one out if you like Final Fantasy games.	1
I am of the opinion that this is the last of the great Final Fantasy titles (newly released anyway, not including the re-makes of some of the older installments). As much as I thought that FF8 was an awesome game, I wasn't too crazy about the overly-complicated battle system at the time. So I thought it was great that they streamlined it for FF9. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first when they revealed the plot was going to take place in a midevil setting because they risked losing some of the originality. But this game was still very original nonetheless.  While this game overall is not extremely easy, I thought the final boss in the game was fairly easy - especially compared with Sephiroth and Ultimecia.	1
This game started out fun enough. It was only my second racing game (the first being Moto GP) and I thought I was missing something. It turns out that it was the game that was missing something. The earlier tracks are easy enough but as you go up they become increasingly difficult until there is little more involved then sheer luck and even that doesn't work. Cars crash and this is about the only way you can move up in the posistions. There are only a few songs and they rapidly become annoying. The effects are nothing special and the cars fly apart in large chunks, all in all it's not very thrilling. The hidden bonus cars are fairly ridiculious and a few even make it difficult to drive because you can't see the track as they are so big, there's actually a car in the shape of a big spider (legs and all). This was a pretty disappointing game.	-1
I was an avid fan of Indy-style racing long before the CART/IRL split, so I figured I would enjoy CART Fury.  However, I love the game primarily because it gets AWAY from simulation-style racing games. At 60fps, the action is fast and furious.  Except for the nearly-impossible Simulation Mode, all the features of the game are very arcadeized.  Even the courses based on real-world circuits are arcadeized; for example, compare Surfer's Paradise (Australia) in CART Fury and Newman-Haas racing, and the arcadization is explicit.  However, success often depends on how many cars in front of you crash and burn, and this usually occurs directly in front of you, making rapid reflexes a must. Perhaps the biggest pitfall of the game is the cast of objectified women.  On many screens, one of these busty ladies - supposedly a crew chief - gives you tips or information as you make a menu selection or wait while the game loads.  After winning a race or championship, your car is shown on a raised platform, while a videoscreen behind the car shows these same women dancing, presenting a trophy, and generally trying to be hypersexual.  This will likely turn off most female players from this game. If the Simulation Mode was easier and the game's loading times faster, I would definitely rate this as a "5."  Overall, objectifiaion aside, this is a great game for those who are not simulation fans.	1
A strange little game which starts very ambitiously and really gets lost along the way somewhere. There are a number of borderline offensive features -- such as the sex dream sequence, the subtext that Satan's not such a bad guy after all, and the Uncle Tom-like black character in overalls -- but the thing that really turned me off was the bad writing, bad animation, and bad acting. Or maybe it's just a bad translation? All in all, not really worth the bother.	-1
Really fun game with a well thought out storyline and the characters have a lot of interactions with each other. Not too long of a game (even though there are 4 disks), but there are a lot of cutscenes on disks 2 and 3. Recommend for any RPG fan.	1
Where to begin with this boring game? As a hardcore Final Fantasy fan, I find it hard to start on how disappointing this game is.  First of all, the characters. They're lame. The main character is this stupid monkey boy who's part of a theater troupe. That's not very badass! After making the super cool ex SOLDIER Cloud and SeeD in training Squall, what was Squaresoft thinking? Did they not look back at the past final fantasies and get that the protagonist is supposed to be a badass? Losers hanging with this failure of a protagonist include a little kid with no face (who came up with THAT design?), an annoying guy in armor who always jumps up and down, a girl with purple hair (lol, is this an supposed to be an anime?), and another girl that's named after a weapon she doesn't even use, awesome. None of these characters are as awesome as Barret or as hot as Tifa and they all look like they came out of a cartoon, another failure on Squaresoft's part.  Next, the story. It's stupid. The only thing I can recall from my boredom is that it involves stealing a princess during a play performance (wtf?) and preventing an airship from blowing up or something like that. The main villain is some fat blue lady. What the hell is that about? While playing this I just sat there wishing Sephiroth would jump into the scene and stab her! I stopped playing after the first disc, where in the end some white haired chick looks down at the dead characters and flies off on a dragon (was that supposed to be a female Sephiroth or what? who cares) The world was boring. It was all castles and medieval crap like that. Hello! Final Fantasies are supposed to take place in futuristic worlds with technology and guns!  Lastly, the battle system. What a pile of crap. Only the stupid kid can cast black magic, the girl is the only one who can heal, and the other guys are the only ones who can use real weapons. What kinda system is that? It's like they're each supposed to have a designated role! You're supposed to have 'em learn spells though materia! Oh wait, only REAL Final Fantasies are allowed to have materia, my bad. Also, why do you control four party members? First of all, that makes this game even more confusing and stupid, and second of all, REAL Final Fantasies have only three party members!  In conclusion, this game fails to please any Final Fantasy fan due to to Squaresoft's failure to take a look at the franchise's  roots. If Square had looked back and reflected on what made Final Fantasy such a great series to begin with, they would have known this game would be a disappointment to any longtime Final Fantasy fan such as myself.	-1
Ive always been an RPG gamer but just now getting around to FFIX. Im about halfway through and have a good enough feel for the game to write an accurate review. That and im in the mood.  Pros +Characters are more defined as magic users / fighters as oppose to FF7 and FF8 +Story gets exciting (starting on CD2), classic battle system +Surprisingly challenging +Always alot going on, different groups of allies doing different things (Think FF3 SNES) +You learn skills by equipping items and fighting with them. This is kinda the new "twist" in the series at the point the game was made (like getting magic from enemies in FF 8 or the leveling system in ffX)  Cons -Steiner (a character in the game) is as annoying as crap the whole first CD -The first CD and  the beginning of the second, I feel, are fairly weak. About a quarter through the second CD is where the plot is picking up and the games starting to get fun -The limit break system is useless. It fills up slow and you lose it all at the end of the battle even if the character doesn't get to attack.  So in conclusion, this is a good solid RPG but you gotta go through the first 8-10 hours which are fairly mundane.	1
A lot of things people don't seem to understand about this game is that, It wasn't meant to have better graphics then 8, it wasn't meant to be a huge step in the new direction that Final Fantasy was heading into. It was rather, a step backwards, paying homage to what made the Final Fantasy series great in the first place. They went back to the small bodies with oversize heads, cute looking characters, little villages and towns rather than the more futuristic aspects that 7 and 8 utilized. And if you paid close enough attention, you would have seen aspects and items from previous final fantasies thrown in as a "wink" to the true fans. Overall this game was immensely fun to play, it had an epic story. Heart wrenching at times, it had it all. The abilities system was very easy to understand, and it wasn't confusing at all. Once an ability was learned you could switch and change them at will when facing different types of enemies. The wide cast of playable characters (over ten characters!) You never got bored of your party as it was constantly changing. Kuja was an amazing villain (Which I personally think gives Sephiroth a run for his money.) and had no trouble using people and then simply disposing of them like a piece of garbage once they had served their purpose in his overall plan. The only thing I didn't like about the game was the card game served very little purpose (no purpose at all actually) and the whole trance thing could have been better. Many times, a character would trance at the very end of a battle and did nothing but frustrate me because certain characters trances are very valuable and destructive and it takes a long time for them to reach trance status. But I did like trance when the timing worked out for a character to trance just in time for a Boss battle. It was a good idea, I just think it could have been implemented a bit better. I loved the involvement of moogles in this game. They were everywhere kupo!. The mognet was a cute touch. Unnecessary but it added a little something extra to the game. Like I said before, I think many fans didn't like this game because they didn't quite understand what Squaresoft meant it to be. Not a revolutionary game, it was a simple farewell to their old style, and to give the fans one last adventure in the style that made Final Fantasy so great in the first place. They knew that once FFX came around, they wouldn't turn back. So I thank Squaresoft for this precious gift of Nostalgia that they gave us before moving into the next generation of RPG gaming.	1
This game has received a lot of guff since it came out, but I think it's an amazing game, with many funny, poignant, dark, and otherwise highly enjoyable scenes, twists, and characters.	1
being a final fantasy fanatic, what else is there to say. the game lived up to expectations, the mini card game is a pretty interesting twist, i must admit i love it though. gameplay is great as usual as with all other ff's even though i must admit there was a lil something missing (can't place my finger on it though). but all in all, a must have for final fantasy lovers.	1
This game continues a lot of Final Fantasy traditions: It tweaks the battle, money, item, and command systems, introduces new characters, and has a deep plot to it too; however, this game is also meant to be a throwback to some of the old Final Fantasies by reintroducing some old elements too. (such as "fixed" jobs for each character)  It's the first Final Fantasy to do this, and it definitely succeeds in both!  Final Fantasy fans will definitely enjoy this one because of the latter features... and the return of some old faces.  Newbies will still enjoy this game though...even if they don't get all the references. LOL	1
This game is a classic! For a game that is almost 10 years old...The graphics are great, the cutscenes well done and cinematic. The Fighting is old school but still fun in 2009. The story is somewhat typical of RPG's from that time , but the characters themselves are well developed and fun. Comparatively, FF8, I found that I did not care for any of the Characters in the end..FF9 is different. To me this is definately and improvment over FF8. I am hoping that FFX is even better (No, I have not played it yet...I was starting from FF IV and building my way up.)  Very much worth the hours you'll put in Kupo!	1
I'll try to keep this short by just saying things that stuck out to me:  1) The story is pretty good. A little familiar to the plots of FF's... oh, 1-5 maybe, but good. There are definitely enough differences.  2) Levelling up isn't that hard, but learning abilities can be a little annoying. You level up by the equipping armor/weapons that teach them. So if you come across, let's say, a more powerful magic wand for your black mage that teaches... let's say Flare but you haven't fully learned Osmose (and these are just examples), you need to keep the first one till you get enough AP to learn it without that weapon. Hopefully that makes sense; I know it's been somewhat of a hindrance to me when I play.  3) The music is definitely good... but I think 8's is better--though I like the regular-fight music more in 9 than in 8.  4) Summoning isn't possible until I think either the tail-end of Disc 1 or the beginning or so of Disc 2.  5) The ending is FANTASTIC. Kinda long though.  Overall, I love this game. It's well worth buying!	1
A lot of people don't like this game for some reason, but I loved everything about this game unlike that stupid Final Fantasy VII that everyone loves I mean its good but I like ff6, ff9, ff10, ff5, ff12 way more then ff7. Everything about ff9 makes it amazing so I highly recommend this game	1
This is one of the best Final Fantasy games made. graphics are good, especially in movie. game is fun and easy with an excellent story. lots of side quests and games, such as the new CARD GAME, CHOCOBO HOT AND COLD. and much more. this game is highly recommended for all.	1
Started playing right after FF8. At first, I didn't like it because FF8 was some what more realistic, so it took a hour or two for me to get use just how different it was. You can't really compare FF9 to FF8 because it is more of a throw back to earlier Final Fantasy's. While FF7 was revolutionary to the RPG world and FF8 showed us the mature and dramatic  route Square Enix is going with the series, FF9 was pretty much the last taste of what Final Fantasy was. And let me tell you, the taste was good.	1
Final Fantasy IX is indeed my favorite game of all time, and I've played a great many RPGs. There's just something amazingly charming about this game that I can't quite put my finger on. I've played it multiple times and I never get tired of it. Overall, this game simply excels.  Graphics (score 10/10): Some people are put off by the large-headed characters, but it didn't bother me. What I really love, though are the towns and other environmental locations.  The various locations of the game are all beautiful in their designs (my favorite location is Cleyra; I just love the look of this place).  Even though the PS1 has poor graphical capabilities compared to today's systems, I've never seen a game with such beautiful and detailed environments.  You can really tell that the designers made the most of the PS1's abilities.  Music (score 10/10): I love the music in this game! Many of the tracks have a meideval sort of feel to them, but in an upbeat kind of way. Alot of it just feels...cozy. I can't think of any other way to describe it.  Every time I listen to the game's soundtrack I just feel like curling up with a relaxing cup of tea. I guess that if you prefer action-packed music this wouldn't appeal to you though.  Characters (score 10/10): The characters are well-developed and everyone is just so darn quirky and likable. I really became attached to Freya--I'm not even sure why. Square really did a good job with characterization without using voice-overs. For example, Vivi can be seen fiddling with his hat in many scenes, portraying a nervous habit. It's just little details like these that make the characters so enjoyable.  Story (score 10/10): The storyline too is also very enjoyable. I found many parts of it to be very relaxing, although exciting moments are in there too. Overall, the narrative is well-crafted right to the very end (with the exception of the final boss, where did he come from?) By the time you've finished, you'll feel like you've been on an epic journey and all the characters have become your life-long friends.  Battle System (score 10/10): The battle system is turn-based, and pretty easy to learn. You learn skills by keeping weapons equipped until the skills are learned. This is the only irritating part of the system, because it can get annoying when you want to learn a skill but have a much better weapon you could switch to. But this is only a minor gripe, as the rest of the battle system is excellent.  Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me. Where to begin? Well, there's nothing wrong with the camera system (thankfully). Oh, there are plenty of minigames and side-quests available to please everyone. I especially enjoyed the Chocobo Hot&Cold game.  The pacing of the story is also excellent.  The game does a very good job of balancing combat-heavy portions of gameplay (like going through a dungeon) with more relaxing non-combat gameplay (like exploring a town for information).  Honestly, it's this perfect balance of combat and non-combat portions of the gameplay that makes Final Fantasy IX so enjoyable.  Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score. I really highly recommend this game to all RPG fans. I think it really deserves it's 10/10 score, especially compared to other games (and I've played a lot). This is definitely my favorite game out of all of them. Considering it's current affordable price (about $15 as of now), I suggest any RPG fan pick it up.	1
Final Fantasy IX is everything a final fantasy should be. This game really takes you back to the roots of the series in a way only final fantasy can. the animation is beautiful the cgi cut scenes are great the summons look great. the battle system is easy and fun with the combination of synth shoppe makes the game more complex and deep. the story is amazing the landscapes are breath taking and the airships are beautiful. This is one of my faviorate Final Fantasys I could Play this one over and over and never get sick of it.	1
I have played Final Fantasy VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, Tactics, and Tactics Advanced, and I do think this has the best story line out of all of them, and i think that's what makes a good game.	1
One of my favorites in the series. Comical with great game play for all ages and just of a bit of an Old School feel. Jody Bissoon	1
This great classic is starting to get old, but is still a blast to play and the last "classic" Final Fantasy	1
Great game, lost it had to repurchase and glad they had still.  Still play it (on my PS3 lol) and still love it.	1
...again...there's some real issues with the artwork here...oh well...  Now that title is saying something because I found that this FF was by far the easiest (Soul cage can be killed just by casting life). But that aside this game is still brilliant.  The characters interact with eachother well and when Vivi's friends are attacked that's just as heart wrenching as Aeris ***Spoiler***. Kuja is second evilest villain ever (below Sepiroth) and all the characters have their own individual skills so you don't have to worry about teams being unbalnced. One thing I would say is a disadvantage is the trance system, for some people it's very good (Zidane has some cool dyne moves) but for others it is completely pointless (there isn't much difference between Summon and Eidolon) besides that though the combat system is great.  Buy this if you have FF7. If not buy that first as it is the best game to get you into the FF world, universe, dimension etc...	1
I bought this recently from Amazon and I found this game to be extreamly fun. The controls are different from other games. The plot is well made and the characters are all unique. This game could turn a frown upside down in a heart beat with the great Chocobo side quest. Yes its frustrating but who doesn't love to ride a Chocobo around the world. The battle system is in my opinon a tad bit slow. I played FFVIII before this game and I compared the battle systems and after you enter an action with IX it takes a while before that action is taken. While on the battle system because of the "delay" battles with bosses can be quite frustrating when you trying to heal and the boss gets an attack before you can heal and kill the person.	1
How unfortunate that, in this day and age, we forget where the meat of console RPG'S really came from. The classic, Turn-Based role-playing was what made this game so excellent and so missed when it was lost in It's time.  Though a bit-overhyped when it came out, it was word of mouth LATER that really sold this game.  If FF fans are anything they are avid in their personal fav's. Some hail this one, other's ff7, some even ff8(most being a cross between 6 and 7) yet, all favor Square for all of the hard work they actually put into these title's.  This is one that's impossible to despise.	1
Final Fantasy 9 was the first RPG I ever played. Years later, it still remains my favorite. Maybe it's because at the time I was introduced it seemed as if the graphics,gameplay, and storyline were all untouchable. I like the battle system and the complexity of the characters. Vivi is my personal favorite, as he is basically a gentle giant who struggles socially despite his incredible power. Final Fantasy 9 is a must have for any Final Fantasy fan or any RPG fan for that  matter. It's only $19.99 brand new!!! Even if you've played it, beat it again.	1
This is with Final Fantasy VIII one of the best games on the saga, it is full of good animations, the stoy is excellent and it has a lot of hidden stuff that will keep you playing for hours. A must have if you are a fan of this saga.	1
Great game for Final Fantasy fans. Has great graphics, good story, plenty of areas to explore and many other features that make it one heck of a game.	1
Final Fantasy Nine usually rates as my favorite Final Fantasy and here's why.... The mood of the game.  I mean look at the popular RPG's.  There not fun (keep reading before you bite my head off).  They are a lot of things.  They're enticing. They're beautiful. They're intracite. They're complex. They're mezmorizing.  They're entertaining.  But how often have you played an RPG like Final Fantasy 8 or The Legend of the Dragoon and thought to yourself in a carefree fashion "Wow, this is really fun!" Certainly you don't think that when a main character dies, or when a kingdom is under attack.  You feel what your characters feel.  I mean that's the beauty of an RPG.  Its the ultamite interactive novel designed to send you on a powerful emotional roller coaster.  That is why they're so enticing.  Because unlike the average fighting or sports game, an RPG strikes up your emotions, your imagination, and so much more.  Does Final Fantasy 9 do that? YES! Then why is it different... because the first and primary emotion the author (not programmer) wants you to feel is a sense of fun, an element that is far too sparse in the realm of RPG.... So lets go over why.  1. Have you seen the graphics.  When paired side by side with its immediate predicessor, you would think that 8 came first.  The graphics are what set the mood, and the mood is a light, bright, carefree mood.  The characters lack the dark setting that exists in almost every other RPG.  Come on... How can you look at ViVi and not smile. (you'll find out as you get more imersed in his story... but for now look at him as the cute, would be helpless except he's super powerful mage that we all love and adore)  2.  Listen to the music.  Sure their are the serious and sometimes dark moment that drives all RPGs, but the general music of this game is pleasant and free.  If you just close your eyes, you'll find that you quickly are at peace.  3. The comedy.  No story (including RPG's) can succeed without at least tickling the funny bone.  Even the tragedies of the world need a little relief in order to set you up for a fall.  This game has plenty, and I think you'll find yourself chuckling at Zidane (the main character) and his constant advances towards the Princess Garnet.  Now don't think that this doesn't have that serious and intriguing story line.  Like all good games the world is threatened by a great evil, and believe me, you'll find yourself wanting more of this.  But the fact of the matter is most people at some point and time get bored with an RPG.  The fun factor of this helps keep that boredom at bay.  I highly recommend this game to everyone and anyone who wants to truly enjoy an RPG, especially if this is your first one.  So please give it a chance.... you won't regret it  ~Brandon Scott Johnson	1
This was a great game and took the Final Fantasy series in a different direction than recent games along the series. The game feels (and looks, without the pixelation) like the first few FF games.	1
I like this RPG. I love the character design and the music. I like the ending a lot. I think Square Enix should create more kidlike characters.	1
I enjoyed this game when it first came out. And that is how I am rating it. Been too busy to try this since then. But still overall a fun game (from what I can remember) ok, see ya!	1
I have loved Final Fantasy games for a long time. So when I saw this game I just had to have it. It,s game strategy is similar to the Final Fantasy VIII strategy. A new feature is the treasure hunt game by the chocobo. The characters are humanized animals, which is quite a cute approach. It is difficult and tough to proceed at certain parts in the game, so I stopped playing the game, kind of put it on ice, haha. It is a good game if you can get all the way through. I don't know why they make games so hard to solve sometimes, or is it just me?	1
This game is like the popular guy in school. It has lots of die-hard fans, because the designers made the game in a deliberate attempt to attract them. "Everyone liked the oprea scene in FF6? Then let's put a play in this one. And a card game, like in FF8. And some characters that were manufactured. And a princess, and a dragoon. And let's make everything cute. In the design of this game, eclecticism is a method rather than an influence, as in the grade-school exercise of writing a story and putting all of one's best friends in it, yet the presentation of this game still somehow manages to be more mature than that of FFX, although the plot is less compelling.  The soundtrack for this game is superb, featuring a great amount of quality music, underscoring everything from the game's characters to its environments to its events. The ability to split up while exploring towns, and watch cut scenes chronicling the adventures of the estranged characters, is cool, and the characters are cool as well, but unlike in FF6, another FF game with cool characters, there is no dramatic impetus driving the story forward. As a player watching the cutscenes, it is hard to root for particular outcomes of events, because everything happens arbitrarily, and whenever it seems that the party has finally inherited a mission, the next plot point changes the whole situation and makes the mission obsolete, rather than simply throwing an obstacle between the player and the completion of the mission.  This game has the least systematic innovation of the entire FF series, and the elements of the series' battle system reprised in this game were never the series' best in the first place. Battles are fought FFIV-style, with only one or two feasable choices for how to spend each character's turn, there's a lack of variety of monsters within each environment, and a lack of opportunities for the player to challenge himself by entering a dangerous environment before the plot demands it. The battle screen loads slowly, and the battles themselves seem to run less smoothly than in any other ATB-based FF game, with frequent incidences of irrational lag between character turns, and between the selection and execution of an action. Sometimes an ATB bar can fill from empty to full during this lag time, making the order of turns just as confusing as if there were no ATB bar at all. The prerendered backgrounds in FFIX are, individually, even more gorgeous than those of FFVII or FFVIII, but FFIX is significantly less atmospheric than either of those games, with many sections of the map seeming to have been pasted together randomly.	1
FF Family presents itself.  Always a great game... no need for explanation!	1
This is probably one of my least favorite FF games on the PSone. There are some good things and some bad things about this game. first the bad: 1. Squaresoft (Now Square Enix, Goddammit!) was trying to get to the old roots of the SNES games. To me anyway, it doesn't look entirely like those games. 2. Some of the characters are the worst in the FF games' history (Quina, Eiko, and Garnet. I am not sexist, it's just that their abilities suck and their type of combat is terrible). the other characters are good, not great, but decent. 3. I don't care too much for the character models (the deformation and Final Fantasy 8 graphics mix). okay for the good parts of the game: 1. The Cinemas!!! they look really good for a PSone game, most of the games cinemas on the PSone don't look that great in this era of gaming and even some during that era. 2. Ending!! I am not saying anymore. 3. The battle system. it's not quite FF8 and not quite FF7 but it's in between and has the Trance system thingy. After this game, I sadly am seeing the series not being as good as it once was (I like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals and can't wait for the remake of FF3 for the DS), Final Fantasy 10 isn't that legendary, FF 11, which I never did and never will play (because of fees, reminds me too much like Phantasy Star Online (I like that game though), and not much of a single player expericence with no storyline), and FF 12 just because it will have the FF11 battle engine, looks like FFCC and FF10 mixed together, and I just seem not to care that much about the newer FF games anymore. So I would recommend any FF game on the PSone (Including the PSone ports of the SNES games and Origins) because they are so great and even if the games don't have the best graphics in the world, it's gameplay and storylines that count.	1
Final Fantasy IX is easily one of the greatest games released for the Playstation and might possibly be the greatest Final Fantasy game ever created. And there are some pretty good other FF games out there...  This game reminded me greatly of Chrono Cross, which is another awesome Playstation game. But where that game failed, this one shined. In Chrono Cross there were 40 playable characters all with paper thin personalities. This game has 8 characters but every single one of them was memorable and a joy to play.  Theres the hilarious and hungry Quina, the cute and sad Vivi, the confident ladies man Zidane, and the typical loner Amarant.  Every character oozes with life and looks wonderful. The designs and dialogue are a joy to behold in this game.  Each character is also very unique in that they have their own special skills unlike some other Final Fantasys like part 6 and 7.  Every thing is perfect about this game, from its story, graphics, music, movies, dialogue, and gameplay. This game took me 60 hours to beat it and every side quest and every second was a wonderful experience.  If there is one minor gripe i have its that the game was too easy. I blew through every boss battle with one try and the only battle i ever died on was against the hidden boss Ozma.  Once you get the Auto Regen skill you can sadly hold down the fight command and just sit back and demolish the game.  In the end this game is a true gem. It is easily one of the greatest Final Fantasy games and one of the top rpgs of all time. If you own a Playstation or PS2 you should not be without a copy of this game.	1
I'll consider this game to be a kind of apollogy from Squaresoft for the terrible FF8  The good:  INteresting charachters  good dialouge  Battle system is A LOT better than 8, none of that Salary based GP or Drawing magic BS.  Graphics are outstanding  The overall story is pretty damn good  The Bad:  I HATE that Knight charachter! he is such a whiny annoying little bitch! I was hoping that charachter would be killed off!  The Ugly:  Princess Garnet's mom....  this game mixes the best of the old (like Final Fantasy 3) with the best of the new.	1
A really annoying part of my life is that there's all these really awesome video games that are not on the market anymore and I have some trouble getting my hands on them and then when I finally do, I have trouble finding someone to discuss them with because I was too young to have played them the first time around.  Final fantasy IX is the SINGLE BEST GAME I have ever played.  I mean, sure to some people the graphics would leave something to be desired.  But I think they're absolutely great.  I inversely kind of like the text boxes as opposed to the long winded dialogue of Final Fantasy X (which I was old enough to play as soon as it came out)partly because you can read as fast as you want, and you can tack funky accents on to the characters.  For example, in my universe, Blank talks in a Scottish accent, Zidane speaks Cockney, Steiner talks in a Mickey Mouse voice, Eiko sounds a bit like Vivian Blaine and . . . never mind, not important.  Anyway...  The game itself is too amazing for words.  A person could spend fourteen hours playing it without noticing that any time passed at all.  It's a game that draws you in right from the very start.  Following Vivi's wander around Alexandria, which in itself is rather fun, you get taken to Alexandria Castle, which is arguably the most fun part of the entire game, beginning with a fight which precedes an awesome mini-game in which Blank and Zidane duel.  The game is linear, but flexible, and you end up getting pretty attached to the eight main characters--Zidane, Garnet/Dagger, Freya, Vivi, Steiner, Eiko, Quina and Amarant--and even to the side characters like Kuja, Puck, Beatrix, Baku (who sneezes every time he's about to make an entrance) Marcus, Blank and Cinna and even Ruby.  There are so many memorable points in the game--playing with chocobos in the chocobos forest, hanging out in Alexandria at the start of disc 3, exploring Alexandria castle at the beginning of disc 1, saving the people of Cleyra, fighting giant puppies in Alexandria, wandering through the woods to Black Mage Village (and dealing with the supreme frustration of seemingly malfunctioning signs) renaming Garnet just 'Garnet', kicking the stuffing out of Lani in Fossil Roo, mucking around at Daguerreo, cooking dinner at Madain Sari--the list is endless, but this list makes Final Fantasy IX a game you'll want to play again and again and again.  The plot is fascinating, the characters are delightful, the gameplay is simple, and to be frank, the only difficult part of the game is fighting Lani at Fossil Roo . . . making it all the more memorable when you finally kick the stuffing out of her.	1
Strangely, the practically universally-loathed Final Fantasy VIII is probably my favorite of the series although I can't tell you why that would be. IX came soon right after and was released to not as much fanfare but it was just as anticipated with not only a return to more lighthearted fares and more brighter atmosphere and colors but was now in spirit to the NES/SNES days of the series with many references. Of course that also meant that several elements felt..."borrowed" to say the least so IX is one of those titles that is a pretty fun play and quite memorable but maybe we just expect too much of the series since IX is kind of flawed but still entertaining to a degree.  Story: Zidane is part of the Tantalus group, a band of thieves who are planning to sneak into Alexandria Castle and kidnap Princess Garnet. Thing is, however, is that Garnet wants to be kidnapped with worries of her mother, Queen Brahne, and her recent erratic behavior. The group escapes and soon get caught in a huge battle with several kingdoms in turmoil thanks to Brahne and a strange man seen recently in the castle.  Graphics: In many ways, IX is ahead of VIII for graphics although VIII is more realistic, IX just outshines it with more detailed and lush backgrounds, diverse locales and more "animated" character movements. The FMV's are the definite highlight since there's a grander scope and they're shot similar to Hollywood productions with an eye on vista shots and exciting sequences. The world map as usual looks ugly while battle graphics are usable but not stellar.  Sound/Music: IX's soundtrack is probably Nobuo Uematsu's most profilic work, with an excess of 100 tracks, including a separate soundtrack for the music played in FMV's. This is a mixed bag of course since some music such as Messenger of Ruin, The Place I'll Return to Someday, Melodies of Life and Frontier Village Dali are just as great as anything in his oeuvre while there's some decent tracks as well as functional, unmemorable and downright awful. Irony is he says this is his best soundtrack so I'll let you be the judge.  Gameplay: The Final Fantasy series has always been similar to each other with the same battle commands, levelling up and side quests available. But what's different is how you get stronger. Similar to the Esper system, a piece of equipment (you have 5 slots: armor, head, body, wrist and special) can come with various abilities, such as Cure and Fire for the mages, Beast Killer for the attackers or support abilities like Antibody and Auto-Life. Each ability has a number of AP for you to master which is received after fighting enemies. After getting the requisitive amount, you can de-equip the equipment and use it freely, whereas if you take it off before you master, you lose the ability until you re-equip it again.  The game is also littered with more sidequests with the big 2 being chocographs and Tetra Master. In the world there is the Chocobo forest, where you play a kind of Hot-and-Cold digging game, digging up items with some being chocographs, a visual clue to a treasure found somewhere in the world. Find it and dig it up and you get better rewards. I've gotta say it's quite an addicting game and although there are times where the accuracy of finding items is a bit too picky, it's still easy to be sucked in. As for Tetra Master, it's confusing, at times it's almost unfair and it's just not as involving as Triple Triad. So naturally there'll be a tournament that's required you beat to progress the story. Just play cards from the start and build a collection and you'll be fine.  The game's difficulty is also a burden for some since at times it's easy. Personally at times it's unbalanced since if you level up properly, the game can be easy but the ATB meter (a meter fills which'll then allow you to select an action) is way too slow and enemies can pack a wallop, plus your phoenix downs give you a pathetic starting health so don't be surprised if they're re-killed before you even get to cure them. But this isn't an RPG that'll make you rip your hair out but some will either find it way too easy or at times simply unfair.  Is it the best in the series? Probably not, unless you particularly love this one. Me, I merely like it: enough to finish it and be entertained by it, but not enough to love it.	1
Now before you look at this and mark it unhelpful because I didn't give 5 stars, just listen to my reasons first.  I love Final Fantasy, and I love FF9, however for me it is the weakest of all the recent FF's (7,8,9 and 10, not including X-2 which isn't really in the series as such).  My main gripe with the game is that it was far too easy, on my first time completing it, I only died once, and that was because I ran into the secret boss Hades by mistake.  I also did not have to go out of the way to build the character levels up like in previous games.  I know some find this annoying, but for me, it is an important part of the challenge of a good RPG, and by not having to build the characters up, it is only catering to the casual gamer.  Despite this it is still a great game, i've never played a bad FF game, the locations are great, the plot is good, though the characters aren't especially engaging.  As usual there is plenty to do outside of the regular game, though again not as much as previous FF's and the card game is c**p compared to Triple Triad on FF8.  I would honestly recommend this game to anyone, despite what i've said it is a great game, it just felt like a disappointment on the back of FF7 & 8 (I honestly don't know why people rate this higher than 8, I cant see it myself at all).  Please note as well, avoid the official strategy guide for this game, it is awful, see my review for more info.	1
final fantasy 9 is a cute and simple game.  it's not fun to play and towards the end of disc three, kind of becomes a chore to finish the game off.  the ending boss made no sense and every character gets lame/repetive/boring at one point or another.  its predictability makes it too boring to play through sometimes, though its ending is too cute, its mediocre at best.	1
This is the best game I own. The graphics are great and so is the storyline. I defently think you should buy this game. This RPG is very hard to stop playing. It will take a while to beat it and it is challenging. If you like RPGs buy this and the rest of the Final  Fantasy series. If your a beginer it will take a while to beat disk one. When you beat that it will be harder but if you get a lat of pratice you will be able to make it far into the game. I recomend this item.	1
I wouldntgo as far as to say FF9 is as good as the recent FF games,or most of the games for that matter, but it is still a great game. The atmosphere of this game is a far cry from FF8's romantic, adult atmosphere. Everything is more comedic and cartoonish, but the graphics are still up to par with recent RPGs, but not very innovative. (They basically look the same as FF7 or FF8). Anyway, I'll break this review down...  Graphics- 9/10 Like I said, they are up to par with games of its time, but are not very innovative. Then again, the Playstation is very limited graphics-wise. But that's what I love about the Playstation one, the games were not all about graphics, unlike the PS2(I am not a fan of PS2 at all, or the recent FF titles.)Anyway, the character designs are a lot more old-school, especially the black mage which looks pretty cool.  Sound- 7/10 This is one of the low-points of this game, the sound isn't that amazing. FF4, 6, tactics, 7, and 8 all have amazing soundtracks, not to mention 5 as well, but this one just doesn't amaze me. After playing through this game several times and mastering it several times, I still don't really remember any tracks in the game. FF8's soundtrack blew me away, so I was hoping for the same here. The only highlights for music are on the start screen, and the world music is pretty good, as well as the battle music.  Gameplay- 10/10The setup is pretty good, making you choose abilities from items that are equipped and learn them. The junction system in FF8 was in my opinion, one of the most innovative systems ever for a video games. This games isn't very innovative, but it's still a great idea that is fun to do. Also, there's synthesis shops now, where you combine items to make armor. (much like FF8s weapon system, except now you can also buy weapons and armor as well.) Overall, this game has a great system that is a lot of fun. The card game isn't nearly as fun as FF8's in my opinion, though. In ff8, you collected cards and then could card mod them, which was also an amazing idea, but in this game the cards seem to do absolutely nothing for the player, other than giving them knowledge that they completed the game 100%, and achieved the highest card collecting level, which is also pointless. Overall, the card game is just a lame re-hash of FF8's Triad game, so don't expect a blast playing cards here, look to ff8 for that.  Controls-10/10 Basically the same controls as in every other ff game. Now there's an exclamation mark which appears over Zidanes head if you are near an item, which was a pretty good idea.  Story- 6/10 This is the games biggest weak point. In my opinion, FF9 has the most forgettable story out of any FF game. Sure, it has its high points( The idea of having summons attack the town was a great idea,and was pretty sweet to watch) But other than that, it didn't leave me feeling amazed. FF4, 6, 7, 8, tactics and heck they all had great storylines, but FF9's is pretty lame. You go after some little guy wearing a thong, and thats about it, it isn't deep like the other titles, although at times it may appear that way. It wasn't the worst storyline, but definitely not up to par.  Overall- 8/10 I have spent a good deal of my life playing this game, since it took a while to master my characters levels and find all the items, and it was definitely worth it. This is a wonderful game that all RPG fans should play.	1
When I played this game 9, I was very moved. I have never felt such emotion. As the below reviewer say, if you are Final Fantasy 8,10,11etc, it may be a little dificult that you feel such emotion and are moved. Because the CG etc of 10,11 are superior to this 9. But I think that there are more great points  more than such CG in the game.  For instance, the story is so. 8 was a little adult and difficult story. On the other hands, in the 9 game that was the easy story that can be felt by children even or adults that dislike complex story, but that is not a just easy story, that is, warm atomosphere was surrownded around the story. Everybody can write difficult and complicate stories, but what include such plus points like the warm feeling in such limited easy story is in fact very difficult things I think.  At the same time, the main character is very pretty and calm. The graphic was not the best in the series, but for such calmness the game got to be a best game. May be that will be because I was a old game fan since FF1 about 20 years ago. The 9 characters is like FF1 very much, thefore when I played the 9 I was  very happy, I felt the nostalgy. This will be what you can not feel if you are not a old FF fan.  And what I want to say especially is the 9 game systems, that is, very brief game systems. The 7 and 8 and so on were very complex system, I had many times until I got to understand the game systems. In the game, I can enter this story and system without the difficulty.  The 9 is very simple on a side, but can not finish in the simple thing only. You can feel many things, nostargy, calm and so on. Off course music is so.  Thank you for reading my poor English.	1
squaresoft did it again! they managed to make another great FF. although i did like a few other FF's more than this one.. and i do have to admit i bought it with great hopes that it would be the best and it sort of let me down. But if you buy it.. don't expect it to be OMG WOW! because u may be let down but other than that i loved it to death and would buy it in a second	1
When I first bought my Playstation back in '99 I was kinda new to the whole gaming thing. Sure, I'd played Game Boy Color and had a Sega Genesis before. But I wanted to become a gamer, and FF9 was the first RPG I ever played. It introduced me to the world of RPGs and Final Fantasy too, and it was a good choice. As soon as I started playing I was immersed in what was going on in the game. The storyline wasn't much at first but soon it became more interesting and exciting. The random battles are quite good and teaches you to be on your toes at all times, although sometimes your characters are near death and you want to get to an inn before you die and random battles don't help at all. But besides that, this is a very immersive game with many personality-filled characters. It keeps you interested from the opening cutscene to the closing credits. Plus, there's a little mini-game you can play at the end of the credits, but you'll have to enter in a certain code of buttons in order to play it. The music is also beautiful, adding a mood to each scene. This is a definite must buy for any RPG fan.	1
as a game this is awsome, it is fun, has a pretty good replay abality, and the story isn't that bad.  But before giving it five stars you have to compare it to the rest of the series and basically it doesn't live up to it's predecessors.  It tries to go back to the original final fantasy's with the game play, but because of this it is unoriginal and a little bit played-out. It might be unfair to try and compare it to the rest of the series, but this game seems to try and get by on name sake and unless your a die-hard ff fan or else are positive you really want this game, go out and try FF VI or VII because I assure you they are much better	1
FF9 is an awesome ass game from start to finish. This game brings back alot of stuff from the original FF games. Some moves are brought back, some characters are brought back, and the world and towns are brought back to the way they were. The game is just so cool because it's so much like the originals but it has good graphics and a deeper storyline. FF7 and FF8 were good but they just weren't like the originals. I illustrate the original thing so much because I really like the the original and typical FF feel. There is absolutely no downside to this game because it looks great, brings back old things like: moves, music, look, and characters, and it makes for an awesome ass gaming experience from start to end.	1
ff9 still has acceptable graphics, even though it is a ps1 game. the music, apart from the boss battle music, is terrific. the story isn't that complicated, but it is still great. the fmv sequences show what might be the best graphics on ps1. even the ones with no action are awsome and there are some amazing action fmv scenes. the gameplay is a little lacking. i liked the characters having there own special abilities and looking appropriate for their class, but compared to ff10, the random battles are very tedious. overall a very great game.	1
It feels good to give a Final Fantasy 5/5. After giving FF8 a 4/5 due to it's flaws. But it seems to me that FF9 has no flaws. The battle system is well thought out, the graphics are rich and pure, the music is again, astonishing. The story is great. And the best part...it's back to the Final Fantasy roots. The random battles are finally not so many. Just the right ammount. Leveling up is fast and fun. I highly recommend this to any RPG and Final Fantasy fan.	1
this game was alright, but it was kind of boring overall. It seems like Final fantasy VIII and IX have traded traits, as Final fantasy VIII had a great story, but the gameplay sucked, but final fantasy IX had alright gameplay, but a pretty lame story STORY 7.5/10 the story really could be improved, as it is pretty boring. its the usual destroy the evil person plot, but with a few twists and sidequests. The story never hit me with the feeling of bliss when i beat the game, as the ending really was not that great. SOUND AND MUSIC 9/10 very nice accomplishment. the victory theme is no longer distorted and has returned to a remixed traditional type. the sound is great also, as swords sound like swords, but daggers sound differently. magic spell sounds are top-notch (as usual) GAMEPLAY  7/10 at first the gameplay is pretty fun, but once you progress through the game, it starts to get quite boring. finally, the beauty of final fantasy IV is revived, as the black mage can only cast black magic, the white mage can only cast white magic and healing spells, and a summoner summons and also has white magic. zidane (the main character) knows no magic, as he is a theif, so he knows devious theiving skills. a lot of times the gameplay will get a little tedious MENUS AND PUT-TOGETHERS 9/10 after final fantasy VIII, i gladly welcome final fantasy IX's menu functions with open arms. Square finally dropped doing the irritating and pretty stupid materia system, as well as the horridly time-consuming junction system and put on the ability system. this is rather original and pretty cool. you learn abilities from items only (not everyone can learn every ability, i might add), which portrays a descisive challenge to the player, because you wonder if you should keep a weaker weapon equipped that lets you learn a really good ability, or try to take on this hard boss with a really strong weapon, but don't have the ability. this is honestly the first menu i actually had fun dealing with. GRAPHICS 9/10 cmon....its squaresoft, and its final fantasy. you KNOW they are going to have good graphics. the FMV sequences are top-notch (not as good as final fantasy VIII's but im not complaining) the people look like people, and the only problem i have with the graphics are...princess garnet.....her figure is definately not very good looking. they have WAY too many details on her. CHARACTERS 8/10 im fine with all the characters, except for one. all of the final fantasies have one or two terrible characters. for example, FFIV had edward (useless), FFVI had Gau (irritating), FFVII had Cait Sith (downright stupid), FFVIII had selphie (ugh....), and now FFIX has...Quina (irritating) quina is not that useful, and you are forced to use him near the beginning of the game, but you don't have to use him onward, which i am thankful for. REPLAY VALUE 6/10 its an alright game, but once i finished it, i felt no need to ever play it again, as it was really long and pretty boring. i say you rent it first	1
This game has got to be the worst final fantasy ever. There is no way this game could be an dubbed as a final fantasy, i mean seriously come on. This game was one of the easiest games i have ever played and i think it was a simple challenge. i didn't even 9 hours straight i passed way more quickly than any other final fantasy. if you want to check it out that's up to you, but take my advice, it's not worth it.	-1
I have finally realized that Final Fantasy IX is, bar none, the greatest entry in the Final Fantasy series. For so long, I always had to stand by FFVII as my favorite one. But with it's slow start, and the occasional holes in its plot, it has fallen into second place, right behind FFIX. It's taken me a good six or so years to finally realize this, but there are many contributing factors.  1. The challenge. It is neither so easy that anyone could beat it, nor is it so hard that only the most experienced RPG players hold a candle to the epic 4-disc quest this game puts you on. Though it leans more towards easy than hard, it is a pretty good balance.  2. The characters. I never could have imagined designs that better recreate the look and feel of the old games. Every one of them has their moment in the spotlight, and they are quite colorful. Not to mention they bring back some classics: dragoons, black mages with pointy hats, designated healers and what have you.  3. The music. Absolutely epic, full of emotion, it is just indescribably good.  4. The story. This is, by far, the biggest driving force of my love for FFIX. The story of FFIX is like a masterpiece of literary fantasy you can not put down. It's like a series of Disney movies that are all in perfect continuity with one another, picking up right where the last one left off, and the only thing you can be sure of is that like all Disney films of this sort, a happy ending will come at the end of the final one. Filled with comedy, romance, action, adventure, drama, and the most beautiful heart-breaking moments you could ever imagine, it is not to be missed. In fact, I feel someone should novelize it under a name like, "The Princess And The Thief (Based On The Story Of The Squaresoft Video Game Final Fantasy IX)" and sell it so everybody can read it just to see how truly wonderful it is! Just imagine this: a reading of the story accompanied by a live orchestra and a monster LCD monitor broadcasting an Anime interpretation of the story to go with everything!  ...I am drifting a bit. Simply put, there is hardly a negative I can think of about this game. Perhaps if you are a very experienced player of the series and playing this for the first time, it might seem too easy. But at the same time, once the story takes off (which doesn't take long), you will want to keep playing regardless. The story part of the game reads well from cover to cover, and I simply can not get over how amazing it is.	1
This is one of the best FF games ever made. I love that they went back to the old school style of FF. An instant classic.	1
Everybody is always saying how FF 9 is great because it gets back to the roots of Final Fantasy.  But this game is nothing like FF 7 at all.  It doesn't come anywhere close to FF 7.  Its got wacky graphics, and a boring, kiddy storyline, and the combat system in 9 is just way too simplistic.  FF 9 is just another stinker from Square, which is what all us super-fans have come to expect. If they don't get it right next time, I will swear off Square games forever.  That includes FF 7, so that would effectively be like commiting suicide, because without FF 7, I'm sure I would enter a permanent vegetative state. Get it right Square, or I will never be able to forgive you.	-1
The first time I played this game I found it pretty strange and pretty much rushed through it, but I recently purchased it again on my PS3.  It has pretty good music, storyline, and graphics for its time.  I gave it only 3 stars in my earlier review, but now that I play it again, I find it quite fun.  Sure, the characters are pretty strange... not human, but there's alot of side games and quests that make it quite fun.  The card game sucks sometimes cuz it's all about luck, but you can still get it down somewhat.  This game is pretty fun if you have the patience to enjoy it.  If you take your time, and buy all the cheaper weapons, you can get alot better weapons, armor, items at the Synth shops.	1
Normally, any final fantasy game created would inflict upon me  a sense of adventure; with a feeling that draws me into the game itself.  However, this game failed to do what the Final Fantasy games are all about.  Great story.  I found myself entertained, yes, but the story in final Fantasy IX just lacked the depth the previous two titles had. FFVII and FFVIII were probably the two best games ever created.   Final Fantasy IX has a rather cartoonish style, which in my opinion, is just fine, it keeps players interested.  I mus say, for a PS1 game, it looks great.  I was thouroughly surprised with each new summon.  And I stared at the screen in awe when I saw bahamut for the first time.  Awesome. I give this game four stars, just because of the lack of depth.  I might add that the game did seem a little short, totalling 32:00 gameplay, (with sidequests).   This is not a bad game, do not get me wrong.  Innovative enough to keep any Final Fantasy goer interested, but, just not the same as 8 and 7.  Anyone who loves FF games should check out this title, if they have not already.	1
One of the things that have made the Final Fantasy series one of gaming's longest running hits is that each new game tells a unique story, with new characters and plot machinations.  While certain factors of RPG playing on Gaia remain constant, Squaresoft has managed to create infinite variations on the theme of overcoming enormous odds in order to save the world. In terms of what a PS One role-playing game can be, Final Fantasy 9 lies close to the limit.  Extensive use of graphic cut scenes, detailed characters and backgrounds, complicated points of view -- all of that is here, and more.  As such, it represents a watershed moment in the game developer's art, even though it was promptly overmatched by what could be done on a PS2.  Oddly enough, PS2 games are not all that much better, and the PS2 itself is already struggling with it's own limitations. Despite all of these positive factors, my gut reaction to FF9 is that it is a lesser game than FF7 or 8.  Some of this has to do with the adoption of a weaker and less complex plot.  Understand that I don't mean this is a bad plot, just that it is lighter in weight, and thus less compelling, than its immediate predecessors.  There are also some tedious elements in game play that drag out battles.  This makes leveling up a bit of a pain.  Of course, the bosses are less of a challenge here, so levelling up is not as important as it has been. I believe that the one thing that tempered my initial reaction to the game was the cartoonish nature of the characters.  There is an element of silliness in the design of characters like Vivi and Quina that kept me at arm's length for longer than usual before the game builds finally them into more solid characters.  Eventually one gets past that reaction, but I had to make an initial effort towards suspension of disbelief that I haven't had to make in any other game in the series. Taken by itself this could very easily be mistaken for a 5-star game.  But in the context of its fellows and my expectations it fell just a bit short.  This is still an eminently satisfactory game that stands above many of its competitors.  If you liked FF7 and 8 you are going to like FF9 as well.  No doubt about that.	1
This was the very first Final Fantasy game I've played, and I love it. Since last year I've tried several of the Final Fantasy games, and I must say this is my absolute favourite. I won't bother trying to explain the whole story, as it would take several of hours to do so? however I will say that the story is fabolous and will suck right ind! if you're not careful (ha). Simply this game has the most memorable characters I've ever played, first we have Zidane! a skilled thief with the desire to help and to gain the trust of the party completely, but in his onw way seeking his past and true existence. Then we have Princess Garnet (Dagger), a young teenage girl, with a little knowledge of how the world outside her castle functions, but as their journey expands, she will gain the right and proper knowledge of how things should rightfully be. Steiner, what can I say? the ever faithful and loyal bodyguard of Garnet, this man has given me quite some laughs throughout the game. Eiko, a little brad, in her own right, she secretly desire Zidane, but with the princess in the way, she's blocked from ever getting him (damn you Garnet..hehe). Amarant, the solitairy guy who joins the party after he lost to Zidane in a battle, very little is know about his past, he seems very harsh but as you will see, he really has a soft spot. And then theres Quina, a chef, a big mama with a huge fork, although we really don't know if she's a male or a female. S/he joins the party to gain knowledge of the many recipies and munchies of the world, s/he's given me so many laughters, she is truly a gem in the world of the Final Fantasy. And at last, the ever loving Vivi, I've been emotionally moved by this little guy, he's seeking the reason of his existence, only to the discover the horrific truth of his doomed race, If I would say more about him, it spoil everything for you. The game has many, many places to explore and I doubt you'll find them all the first time, so many secret places, so many optional bosses, but hey no complains from this human, I simply adore it. Another reason why I love this game so much, is the beautifully detailed enviroments, I was completely convinced, that this game is the most beautiful graphically Final Fantasy game ever. Another reason why love is because of the disspoinment I suffered, while watching Final Fantasy 8, the game was terrible. Although I really enjoyed Final Fantasy 7, it had some very lovable characters. But the final love for the series came this year, when I bought Final Fantasy Origins, I was overjoyed when I played these classics, and actually Final Fantasy 2, has grown to be my number third favourite Final Fantasy game ever, #1: Final Fantasy 9, #2: Final Fantasy 7, #3: Final Fantasy 2 (Origins). This serie has given me so many hours of joy, laughs and tears, and will forever stay in my memory and in my heart. Sencerely my deepest rescpect to the creators. Love, laughs and tears. Reno,	1
this game is when squaresoft started getting better.  its got much better gameplay than ff8. but the charecters are worse. overall its a good game, that i think people should buy. (they continued the dumb card game, i don't know why they did that.)	1
I started playing this game because I was having problems with my copy of VIII. After hearing how bad it was from everyone I knew who played it, I was surprised to find that I was enjoying it. It's fun to play a less emotionally complicated, lighter game. The graphics are so much better than VIII it's not even funny. Gameplay is definitely Final Fantasy, but uncluttered by complications. I'm going to wait to get a different copy of VIII until I can complete this one. And if I happen to complete this one when X-2 comes out, then VIII will wait longer.	1
This game is my second favorite FF.  I've played through it about 3 1/2 times and i'm still waiting for it to get old.  The characters are well done (even by final fantasy standards, and that's saying a lot) and the magic/abilities system is much improved from the ever confusing and impractical junctioning system from FFVIII.  This system relies on equipping weapons, armor and items, then earning ability points by fighting monsters to learn new skills or develop immunities.  Another noteworthy feature to this game is the music.  this is the only game apart from FFVII that i have ever considered buying the soundtrack to, the music is that good.  I would also like to add that Kuja is one of the coolest villains since Sephiroth.  If only he didn't look so girly...oh well, he's pure evil, so that compensates.	1
Its still worth playing if you are a true FF fan. Loads of fun and some really great graphics. Do get this game, a true classic to play.	1
Final Fantasy IX, is, without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite video game of all-time. I first played it when it came out back in November of 2000. Most of the FF's are great. Everyone has a favorite - some people prefer VII, while others enjoy VI, and the old-school gamers like the early ones like I-IV. Being that I'm an old-school gamer, I enjoyed FF IX simply because of all the references it makes to FF's from the past. It's like a big FF compendium, but this definitely isn't the only reason that FF IX is so good... The biggest reason I like FF IX is because of the story and characters. It will captivate you unlike any RPG before it. You can relate to at least one of the characters and the situations they face. I won't spoil the story, but it gets so amazing, and great character development adds to that. Music is also great. It harkens back to the good ol' days of the FF series, with an amazing Battle Theme, Boss Theme, and even a remix of the old Gurgu Volcano music from FF I. It's all there, and in all, there are over 120 tracks if you count the FMV music. Speaking of FMV's and graphics, they are also amazing. FF IX goes back to the deformed character designs of past FF's, but it all looks good. There are once again Black and White Mages, a medieval world with Castles and Dragons, Airships, and my favorite FF mascot, Moogles (they act as save points throughout the game). But, as no game is perfect, FF IX also has 2 tiny problems: 1) The challenge is on the easy side and 2) A lot of the key items are useless, even if they do raise your treasure hunter rank a little bit. But even so, these problems can be easily overlooked, because the game is so amazing. I recommend FF IX to the old-school FF fans, but even the FF fans who started with VII can enjoy this awesome FF. It's a great mixture of old-school and new-school FF's, which makes for an unforgettable adventure.	1
Before Squaresoft moved on to releasing games for the Playstation 2 game console, the company obviously wanted the PSX's last (original) Final Fantasy game to be something special. After all, with Final Fantasy 7 the company successfully brought RPGs into the mainstream through their game's incredible ease of play and amazing technological accomplishments. Then with FF8, the company opted to take the series in a somewhat different direction through a completely revamped battle system and more character centered storyline. So what did the company do with Final Fantasy IX? Attempt to return the series to its roots... with somewhat mixed results. On one hand, Final Fantasy IX is an excellent RPG. It has an all around solid storyline, if a bit less serious than previous Final Fantasies, with some interesting and funny characters to go with it (my favorite being Steiner). And Squaresoft thankfully threw away the "revamped" Final Fantasy VIII battle system in favor of a less cumbersome/more user friendly system. However, Final Fantasy IX is not quite the nostalgic trip it was hyped up to be. Much of this problem has to do with the graphics, which (truth be told) are Final Fantasy VIII's with super-deformed characters and Lord Of The Rings-ish environments. So don't expect the 2-D anime artwork of FFs 1 through 6. Squaresoft also insists on using the same brand of fancy-panse prerendered cinemas they've been using in the previous two Final Fantasies (which, despite being somewhat blurry, are very well done) which somewhat detracts from the nostalgic feeling of FF9. One more gripe is that, as with FF's 7 and 8, the characters are a bit on the stereotypical side; as opposed to the more generic characters in FFs 1 through 6. Still, when all is said and done, Final Fantasy IX is an excellent RPG. The storyline is well crafted, characters memorable, and gameplay near perfect. Just don't buy it expecting the same experience you had playing Final Fantasy VI back in 1994, because unfortunately you won't get it.	1
Final Fantasy 9 is one of the best RPG's ever made thats a given, but can it compete with todays RPG's?  The graphics in the game are crisp.  There is not an abundant of cut-scenes to bore the gamer out of there mind.  The sidequest are fun for dedicated Final Fantasy games.  The chocobo sidequest takes a while and can get difficult.  Tracking the Chocobo's Paradise can be difficult at times.  One thing is sure the optionals boss fights are hard.  OZMA comes a level 99 and unless your characters are at a high level do not even bother trying.  I would recommend level 80-100, a party of Zidane, Amarant,Quina, and Dagger.  Have Quina use Frog Drop every turn.  Have Dagger use Summons.  Use Amarants throw, chakra,revive abilities.  Use Zidanes Thivery and if he goes into trance do not use his Grand Lethal Dyne ability, conserve you MP you wil need it.  Wear Shadow absorbing armor.  The card game can be hard at times.  Use your strongest four cards.  Have a weak card that has arrows on all sides and use this to your advantage.  To level up fast move west past the mist continent till you come to some islands.  There are Dragons there that can be beaten with Quina's Level 5 Death skill.	1
I've been reading other reviews and a lot of people called this game "complicated" the gf junctioning is not difficult at all.  I got the basics of this game right away.  the card game was hard for me at first! but once i got it, it was easy graphics- 5 the movies in this game are amazing. story- 5 although i never understand why squall is so stand offish playability-5 the easy leveling up ( especially compared to ffx) makes this game soo awesome. the thing that makes this game the best rpg game out there is not only the characters and graphics, but also all the hidden dimensions.  i've yet to get some of the hidden guardian forces in this game.  i didn't even think to get a few of them until it was too late to find them and i had to play again!  this game is awesome!	1
MY FAVORITE GAME EVER EVER... NO ONE IN THE UNIVERSE WOULD LIKE THIS GAME MORE THAN ME... SINCE I BEAT IT OVER 20 TIMES.	1
Final Fantasy VIII was a bit dissapointin cuz it was boring, and this is where Final Fantasy IX gets the series back on track Pros: -Great FMVs -just like other FFs great gameplay -U get 4 people on a squad -Very good abilities -pretty good love story, jes like all the other FFs -Great ending -Great battle system -Story seems dumb at first but gradually gets better -It has some decent sound effecs -The game is pretty long,beat it in 44 hours -The replay value depends on how u like the game -It has three endings; altho there really not worth getting, -It's worth 2 check out -Trance may not be as good as a limit break, but still pretty cool -Square is the king of RPGs and this is one of their greatest Cons: -Kuja is pathetic, and so is the boss after him, lacking a good final fight -Stiner, in the first 2 discs, would never just shut up -A loooooooong boring wait to get to the ending FMV -If u get poisoned or something, jes like FF8 ur stuck with it unless u use somethin -tents don't fully recover health, which is really messed up -If there 15 and 16, how come they look like the're 11 and 12 -How come u can choose to trance or not to trance, that pissed me off -Why did they make the affects of potions and ethers less on the feild? IT has it's share of good and bads, but hey this game is more good than bad, I would give it a 4 1/2 stars if they had it. It's better than a boring, and dissapointing Final Fantasy VIII, but it's not as good as Final Fantasy X, and no RPG will beat the greatest RPG, if not, the greatest game ever Final Fantasy VII.  If u love RPGs, or if u are a fan of Final Fantasy, You should have this game or get it. peace	1
[I FALL INTO THE UNUSUAL CATEGORY... LOVE VII, LOVE IX, BUT DON'T CARE FOR VIII] I really liked Final Fantasy VII, and I was greatly disappointed with VIII. When IX came out, I had never even HEARD of its existence (strange how the previous two were raved everywhere) and I bought it the moment I saw it. This game, as EGM put it, brings the best of the old and molds it with the new into one extremely enthralling game. The story is very OldSkool-ish (albeit the crystal pops up at the very end without explanation, but oh well) with characters that are totally three-dimensional in their personality. While the Trance system is sketchy compared to the limit breaks in previous games, the battle system is overall basic like the old Final Fantasies. The music is also very good. While this game is not nearly as challenging as its previous outings, this game is still a fun experience and worthy of the Final Fantasy series. It tends to be my favorite, although VII and some of the older ones are also good. I really think that a lot of fans were put off by its uniqueness (not every character is human, for example), but if you are a die hard Final Fantasy fan, this WON'T disappoint.	1
Oh my god.. No other game tore me up like IX did; the music is the best in the series, in my opinion, the cast is loveable and colorful, not to mention amazingly deep, and the storyline never fails or falters. Final Fantasy IX is the greatest game to hit the PlayStation console (in MY opinion. I know alot of people still hold true to VII, which is understandable.) It's fun, it's emotional, and it's one [heck] of a video game.	1
Most people either say that they hate it or they love it as do they with FFVIII.  One thing that was good about this Final Fantasy was that it was a little different but with the same characteristics.  The characters were a fresh and new idea to the previous Final Fantasy's.  Even though it had some of the same principles such as battle system (similar to that of FFVIJ).  Overall I think that it has a good story to it, but not the best villan ever.  Also it has some pretty sweet action sequences, probably the best on the PSX.	1
This is yet another Final Fantasy, and like the ones before, it shines. The story, whilst not the best one so far, is still highly enjoyable and entertaining. The graphics are the best on the PSone to date and the sound is quite stellar also.   Vivi has to be by far the most endearing FF character to date. Not sure what about him makes him so loveable, but he is the best character so far. Zidane is also a really cool character with his interesting personality and his funny way with the girls. All the other characters are also great and make the story that much better.   The game play is still pretty good while the battle system, while nothing new is still quite easy to use and navigate. The songs and musical scores still impress with a wide variety of tunes to listen to while you play.   The rest of the game is great with many things to do and many places to visit. The only thing I really didn't like about this game was the ending. Although it was a happy ending and was enjoyable, it was outstanding like that of FFVIII. However, this is a small complaint for an otherwise excellent game. Don't think about it, just buy this one and have fun.	1
Well, I have to say FF IX is my favorite final fantasy so far. The artwork is excellent, and the characters quickly grow on you. The environments you explore are breathtaking. You really feel like your part of a grand quest. This is the most fun I have had with a video game in ages. The sound track is also a joy, its sometimes dreamy,sometimes romantic,sometimes frightening. Nobuo Uematsu, the legendary FF composer really out did himself. So what are you waiting for its only $20!	1
It is good to see Square recover from the doomed sin of that last FF8 game and come to light with this epic!!!  From the start the game has you hooked, and the motion picture beginning is breathtaking to the max!!!  Hey, the ending had me out of my seat as well- I can't spoil it for you but it is worth every minute.  The gameplay, characters and music are back to the original Final Fantasy promise, and is a great way to say bye-bye to the PSone.  More than five stars!!!	1
Final Fantasy IX is my most favorite in the series. Mainly because it feels like old school Final Fantasy. The graphics, sound and control are top-notch and the gameplay is quite engaging. If you like Final Fantasy at all, or are into RPGs, do yourself a favor and try not to miss this one. It's awesome.	1
Squaresoft had gotten a bit bizarre and outlandish with some of their RPGs that came after Final Fantasy VII and IX. From an artistic point of view, they created titles that explored various systems for combat, tactics, strategy, and storytelling, some which worked better than others. Final Fantasy IX comes back to what really works in an RPG, which is plain heroism, discovery, adventure, and mystery.	1
Final Fantasy IX is about a thief named Zidane who is out to defeat another person named Kuja, to put it short.  Throughout his quest he meets many different people and goes to many different places.  I have to say this game is excellent!  The plot is well thought-out.  Active Time Events add additional information about characters and such, which can be entertaining or helpful.  Sometimes, however, these Active Time Events go far from the original story line and get confusing.  The characters are well done, each with their own personalities and differences (my favorites are Vivi, Freya, Garnet, and Eiko).  The graphics are mixed; in cinemas they are excellent, but they aren't too good in every other situation.  The battle system is very good, and I like Trance, a special powerful state characters go into when they are attacked enough (only applies for eight main characters).  The monsters and bosses can be hard to beat, but they are still pretty enjoyable anyway.  The music scores are beautiful.  Learning abilities is very easy; you simply equip armor, weapons, and accessories!  All in all, this is a great game and a must-have for RPG fans.	1
I have played Final Fantasy 5-10, and this is one of my favorites. It may not be liked by everyone but I love it. GAMEPLAY 8:   Not much of a change from the other FF's. No more junction system though The Active Time Battle (ATB)is still around. You gain experience to level up your characters (rasies HP, MP, and other stats) and ability points to gain new abilities. You can have four characters in your party at a time. The game has gone back to it's Fantasy roots intstead of the Sci-Fi from FF7&8. Some of the characters may be a little silly but overall I found them likeable. Not much new here but that isn't either good nor bad. STORY 7.5:   Basically the same as many of the FF's. The main character is something he doesn't really know he is. He love's one of the other characters. My main problem is that the main villian looks like a girly Sephiroth complete with mascara. GRAPHICS 8:   Best graphics of any PSX FF. Great FMX's. Not much else I can say here. SOUND 6:   It has some good songs (though none of them as memorable as the ones in FF7). There aren't any voices in this one though. The sound efects are okay. CONTROL 10:   It's an RPG. Not much to worry about in this category. REPLAY VALUE 10:   This is a Final Fantasy game so of course it's filled with tons of mini-games. I've had plenty of fun playing them...  Some include catching frogs, digging treasure up with your chocobo, and a card game called tetra-master. This card game isn't quite the same as FF8's and I thought it wasn't as good as FF8's. Still fun though...	1
The game starts in the kingdom of Alexandria and ends in Alexandria too.  You play Zidane, a boy with a tail and a member of Tantalus, a band of thives from Lindblum.  You've come to Alexandria to Kidnapp Princess Garnet and bring her back to Lindblum.  However, when you run into Garnet, she wants to be kidnapped.  Garnet comes with you to Lindblum with two other guys: a knight named Steiner and a black mage named Vivi.   Steiner is very protective with Garnet, and will not let her close to Zidane if he can help it.   Zidane is the most open character of the series, however he gets sort of sullen on the third disk.   All in all, the best game for the ps1!!  Also, this hails the last Final Fantasy game that'll be for the ps1.	1
This game is totally awesome! It is interesting and addicting. The characters are totally awesome, just like in all the other Final Fantasy games. This game is a really cool game that I totally reccomend to anyone!	1
I'm a bit biased because I worked on this game but I really think it's the best of the FF series (7,8,9) on the PS1.	1
Unlike the last 2 games from FF, this one's a little more based on the old gameplay of Final Fantasy. The story's pretty straightforward, the graphics are great, and there's no weird anime stuff like in 7 and 8. Plus, the fighting's back to normal. What the hell was with the fighting in 8? Anyway, my favorite character would have to be Steiner. He's a jerk, but he's good at fighting. Probably the strongest member. Also, Vivi kicks [rear]. Especially near the end. Solid game.	1
FF9 is a great game. Black Mages, white mages, knights, dragoons, thieves, moogles, airships, castles, dragons return in a medieval theme RPG. I'm glad Square decided to make the theme medieval like the classic FF's, I was getting a little tired of the futuristic themes from FF7 and FF9. Great game I tell ya.	1
I am perhaps unique in my position as a Final Fantasy fan.  I recognize the warts on the series (and there are some pretty big ones), but I still enjoy it anyway.  I won't try to tell you that this is a flawless game, because it certainly isn't, just as Final Fantasy 7 and 8 were neither of them flawless, but I will tell you that it's the best the series had done to date. First off, the good, and there's a considerable amount of it.  Again, Final Fantasy 9 is a technical revelation.  The graphics are amazing--I've frankly never seen better on the original Playstation console, and this is arguably better than most of the computer games out there today.  The regular game screens are colorful, well illustrated, easy to navigate (a big problem with Final Fantasy 7), and just generally aesthetically pleasing, while the FMV sequences are better described with a series of primal grunts of satisfaction than words. Also as usual, the sound is excellent, though some fans of the series may be a little disappointed with it.  Indeed, a great deal of the music in this game was borrowed from previous entries in the series and refitted for this one.  Personally, I've got no problem with it, but then I also don't put much into a game's soundtrack. The story has always been where the biggest problems have occured for the Final Fantasy series, and 9 will serve as a pleasant surprise for gamers in this regard.  I can't think of a Final Fantasy game that better told or adhered to its story, and the secret to the game's success on this point is its simplicity.  There are no cute plot gimmicks here as there were in the previous two entries (the pointlessly complex story of 7 and the poor reconciliation between the personal story and save-the-world theme in 8), and that allows the story to be direct, easy to understand, and charming. Of course, there are still problems with the game.  In terms of plotting, minor characters seem to show up and drop off the map an awful lot for a game as story based as this one.  Just trace Sir Fratley's course through the story and tell me that's not the case.  Square also falls into an old pit trap in their writing as the story itself seems to spiral wildly out of control in the last hour or two of the game.  I had never even heard of the final boss before I fought him, and the story element that the game itself references on the back cover (the crystal) doesn't even enter the plot until the end. Taken on the whole, however, this has to be considered the best game in the series to date.  The many (and there are a lot of them) references to past games will provide long-time fans of the series with an entertaining Easter Egg chase, while the well developed and unique characters and well told story should speak to any neophyte.  The character advancement scheme is arguably the best in the series to date, combining individual skill customization with equippability with exceptional talent, and with all the various mini-games and sidequests, you can easily spend sixty hours playing through this deceptively deep game.  This truly is a must-have for any Playstation role player, and probably for any gamer at all.	1
I won't waste space here because so many other people have already written what I would otherwise tell you. Final Fantasy IX is, in my opinion, the best RPG and possibly the best game for the Playstation that exists. The storyline, the music, the gameplay, the graphics...it's too much, it's all TOO GOOD! Buy it! No further questions.	1
I love final fantasy and part 9 is a hell of alot better then part 8!! ff7 is still the best ever but this is how a ff should be buy the game if you loved ff7 because this is like playing it over one more time	1
Final Fantasy 7 and 8 became progressively more techonological; in said process they lost some nameless division, a timeless quality that caters to the old-time gamer.  While an effect only felt upon intense reflection, it is still pervasive.  This effect doesn't detract from the gaming experience, 7 and 8 are worthy games in their own right, but it seems to detatch these games from the series' roots.  Final Fantasy 9 firmly grasps these roots, and tenaciously clings to their nostalgic promises.  Perfectly pervasive and overwhelming in its effect, nostalgia floods from the screen while playing Final Fantasy 9--promising, reminding, revealing long surpressed emotions of the beleaguered old-time gamer.  This I felt upon my first time through, and I can't shake the feeling that this kind of game will disappear for lack of support and shivering nostalgia. Perhaps I am paranoid, but that feeling remains.  Please, gamers, don't let this kind of game disappear.  You may not have played the old RPG's, but they became much loved for a reason.  This reason, great design and simplistic charm, is one that must not be supressed by myriad graphical enhancements and gameplay so "innovative" that it eliminates the necessary and unadultured fun that makes RPG's so very appealing. Okay, rant over.  Final Fantasy 9 reveals the life of Zidane, an enigmatic and zany character--benevolent womanizer.  He becomes, through an expertly penned story, the main character in a fight to end the reign of a malign queen--the story eventually elevating to galactic proportions.  With an involving storyline, slick graphics the best of their time, and a simple management system that truly "works," Final Fantasy 9 offers one heck of a gameplay experience.  New RPGers can appreciate the experience, though I believe that the old-school gamer will realize the full importance of this game's homage payment to its roots.	1
WOW! Square decided to go back to their roots and give us a game that has gone back to the era of FF4, 5, and 6.  It was neat to see all of the old themes and types of characters resurface in this game.  Things like Black Mages, Thiefs, Knights, Summoners, and the like are all present in this game, along with castles, small towns, and other medieval themes.  The characters are very well developed (Vivi especially), and each have their own unique personality, along with their own abilities that only they posses.  The item based learning system is sort of a confusing system, but neat in it's own kind of way.  The Active Time Battle System is still used, and can be a nuisance, but makes the game more challenging.  In previous entries in the series the only thing that threatened your party was a boss battle every here and there, but in FF9 even some of the random battles can be VERY CHALLENGING.  The music is wonderful and a lot of the tunes are memorable as well (once again Uematsu does a GREAT JOB).  The new Active Time Event allows you to see what other members of your party are doing when everyone goes their different ways throughout the game. Pros: The series is once again set back in the medieval times, Music is great, Characters are well developed, 30+ hours of gameplay Cons: There seems to be to many random battles (in my opinion), the story becomes very shallow at times, and ocassionally goes off on to many tangents. Overall: Great Game! ranks up there with FF6!	1
After a great final fantasy VII, and a somewhat dismal Final Fantasy VIII, This game blows all the compition out of the water. Final Fantasy IX begins with what seems to be a small kidnapping of a princess, and leads to something that could destroy the very world! The graphics, gameplay, sound, and controls in this game is vastly greater in grandure compared to the games that have come before. Hours and hours of gamplay, complete with a few alternate endings, make this a high mark on squaresoft's already impressive list of games that are a MUST. The characters are built very well throughout the story of the game. The battle system mixes the best of the old, with some new and more exciting fighting systems. The graphics are astounding for a playstation game, and the FMV's are great, coming into the story in exactly the right places. This game is definately a must.	1
This one is my favorite of all the ones in the playstation series.  While FF8 was more serious and realistic, this one takes a spin and makes the characters look younger, shorter, and for the most part a more animated, lusch vibrant world.  Everything, even the graphics, are improved in this final fantasy, plus i like the plot the best.  It seems to be a little more light hearted and less serious.  There are some great mini games in this one, as well as some great characters (Vivi is so cool) as well as some great villians.  Some may agree FF7 is the best, but i disagree... that one comes in a close second place.  This one has more of the goods.  Get this one if you are beginning final fantasy- in 7 there are so many annoying places you get stuck in... get this one.	1
Final Fantasy IX starts out as being a completely different experience. However, it is soon apparent that Square was not thinking correctly when doing this storyline. The monsters almost all bear names that have appeared in previous titles, the black mage (though cool) and the Dragon Knight (wicked, but enough is enough) resurface quickly and linger throughout the game. At first it's fun to see these popular themes resurface, but it has gone way too far. The only plus sides to this game that I can think of are: the great graphics and animation and the music (Uematsu has done it again!) Plus the RPG is too short; if you can get an item by beating the game in less than 12 hours, it is too short, ok? No questions asked.	-1
I have been a Final Fantasy Fan ever since I played the first installment of this series on the Game Boy.  I have played just about every single RPG that has ever come out.  (excluding PS2, X-Box, and Nintendo Cube RPG's)  I have waited to write a review on this game for a specific reason.  I will not take Final Fantasy Games for granted.  I have read some reviews on-line, and then I bought the game.  I did this for some specific reasons, because you will here people giving reviews on both sides of the spectrum.  I have heard people give this game a negative 30 on a scale from 1-10.  And at the same time, I have witnessed people just blown away by this game.  Giving this game time to develope itself in the hearts of its buyer is the key to it's greatness.   The day that I purchased FFIX, I noticed that Square gave it all they had.  If people are going to say that this game sucks, they are putting down the best RPG company in the world today.  Square purposly made this game the way it is.  I love it!!!  The main character is a thief, who has the mission to kidnapp a princess in order to ransom her off.  But in the process the princess wants to be kidnapped, and decides to leave with them.  During the game though, you will notice that there is not one main character.  For a good portion of the game, I felt that Zidane (the thief) was the main character, but then about five minutes later Vivi (the young balck mage)was.  This proccess went on constantly.  There is one problem with the game that can be overlooked.  Constantly you are asked to see what is happening at the same time you are doing your missions.  You will be waling around town, and then a message will pop up saying for you to press the select button for the real time effect.  You then will be shown a scene that is happening at that time.  So, with all of this going on, the first CD of this game seems to take forever.  Not only that, but just about every five minutes you will have a cinematic scene.  This is good and bad at the same time.  They are wonderful scenes, and put together very well, but at the same time you are not able to play the actual game.  But overall, it is worth the trouble, because your mind is put into a trance.  Your sucked into the story, and you don't want to leave.   Real Quick......ranking order of my favorite FF RPG's. 1.  FF3(FF6) 2.  FF2 3.  FF7 4.  FF9 5.  FF5 6.  FF8	1
THIS IS THE BEST RPG GAME, IN PLAY STAION AND ITS NOT THAT HARD SO THE NEW GAMERS COULD PLAY IT. AND IF U R LIKE AN EXPERIENCE RPG GAMER LIKE ME THEN YOU WILL BEAT THE GAME FAST BUT ITS WORTH PLAYING........... SO BUY IT........	1
Where is the quality from the last game Final Fantasy VIII? I mean the game doesn't interest me at all in the beginning, it is too manga and comic relief inspired, and has no real seriousness about it. This makes this a less "hardcore" experience than the Final Fantasy 8. I miss the depth in the characters, and I also miss the complex story that was so evident in 7, and 8. Bad game! I just hope they increase the dark feel of the next game, because this one was too goodie goodie for my taste.	-1
I got FF9 last X-Mas...i love it. it has great graphics and is truely a great way to end the Playstation Era. since PS2 is in an' all. the story was great, the characters were great, and the music was great. but still no FF tops FF7 yet...will the newest FF (coming spring 2002) top FF7? FF8, and FF9 sure didn't.	1
After the horrid disappointment that was FF8, this game has restored my faith in the series.  This gripping storyline with amazing gamplay and terrific characters makes for a very addictive game for any serious RPG gamer.... you MUST get this game!	1
Out of the original titles for the Playstation (Final Fantasy 7,8,9), 9 is hands down the best.  The game is a departure from the realism and bleak futurism of 7 and 8...it's a return to the style of 4 (US 2) and 6 (US 3) that were huge hits when they were released on the SNES.  If you felt let down by Final Fantasy 8, play 9 to regain your confidence in SquareSoft.  If Final Fantasy VI (US III) is a 10, this is a 9.5.	1
Being the first time I have -ever- played Final Fantasy, I must say that I made a wise choice. The Graphics are crisp and the story line is even better. People who have played Star Ocean or Saga Frontier 2 would really like this, not to mention people who havn't. In my opinion Pros: Nice Graphics, Fun side quests, Good Story, and of course (my favorite) so many towns to visit! Cons: Takes a few seconds for it to load from scene to scene, what I mean is when it goes from, say a battle to back to the world map, it will pause for a good 4-5 seconds. Granted i'm sure its because of the graphics, and thus being the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.	1
This game has restored my view of Squaresoft, at least temporarily. You know, you can't just change everything that classifies a game as a Final Fantasy and then slap the FF label on it. There are some features that every true Final Fantasy game on every system from NES to Game Boy to SNES all kept, such as the overall medieval setting with bits of technology, the 4-person party, the class system that kept all the characters' abilities unique, appealing main characters, among other things.  I'm happy to see them restored to their proper place. FFIX redeems the series in my opinion.  Now, the story is a little less serious than other Final Fantasies. However, that doesn't really bother me because I didn't like all the oppressive gloom of Final Fantasy VII. Final Fantasy VIII was a great improvement, but unfortunately, it was damaged by a love theme that was very poorly done, along with very weak character development. This game's story was not meant to confound you with constant plot twists (although there are plenty) or try to mystify you with "hidden truths." I don't need video games to teach me anything about life. This storyline was simply meant to be fun, and there's nothing wrong with that. The character development here is far better, and the dialogue is thankfully not damaged by bad translation or excessive profanity (there should've been a "Soap" materia to stick in Barret's mouth). No more bad attempts at slang such as "chicken-wuss." Granted, Quina's accent can be a little grating at times, but that's deliberate, not a result of poor translation. I think Zidane's romance with Dagger is very well done, much better than Squall & Rinoa's. The problem with the latter is that their relationship just came out of nowhere. There was no connection between them. They spent the entire game getting on each other's nerves and hurting each other's feelings, and then all of a sudden, POOF! They're in love. Zidane and Dagger obviously develop their connection over time, making it far more believable. Does Zidane have to get past some sort of major mental issues or "come out of his shell," so to speak? Nope. The only problem he needs to overcome is to stop flirting with every girl he sees and concentrate on Dagger. It's just a plain and simple relationship, and there's nothing wrong with that. I also like Zidane as a main character. He's very sociable, likeable, humorous, and a daredevil, but he can also be a little full of himself at times, and he's quite obviously girl-crazy. So, he's got merits, and he's got flaws. That sounds like a pretty rounded-out and believable character to me. You see people like that in real life, especially at his age. He's also a refreshing change from these recent pessimistic and apathetic heroes, with abrasive personalities that rub everyone the wrong way (not to mention getting on my nerves as I'm the one who has to play them). Forgive me, but given the choice of either Zidane, or guys who say "I don't care" when you tell them the planet's going to die, my choice is pretty obvious: Zidane Tribal all the way. The gameplay has also restored some of the older Final Fantasy features which I think were better, while still keeping a few of the newer features to make the game a fresh experience. This game's system is something like a combination of three: the old class system of the original, the Job system of FFV, and a little touch of the Junction system in FFVIII. The class system sees to it that the characters stay unique, only learning what their class will allow, while the little touches of the Job and Junction systems allow customization and strategy. It's an awesome and very well-balanced mix. All characters, even silly ones like Quina, have some specialty that truly makes them a valid team member. Chrono Trigger players will even notice a few Double Techs between Steiner and Vivi.  I also like the fact that this system takes away the possibility of creating a party of demigods, though some may see this as a bad point. I also like the Trance feature, to an extent. Sure, there isn't much eye candy with the attacks, or any over-the-top attacks like Lion Heart (don't get me wrong, Lion Heart's the best move I've ever seen in an RPG, but it does so much damage it's ridiculous--and it's so final... That attack could have been saved for an FMV in itself, to show Squall finishing off Ultimecia). I like Trance because it is more controllable than a one-time limit-break, and I also like the little transformation that it does to the character graphics. What I don't like, though, is the fact that it's completely useless if it comes in at the end of a battle. Also, as relates to the battle system, I find that the ATB gauge runs unusually slow in this game. I don't really like that either, especially in parts of the game where your time is limited (like the Festival of the Hunt).  It seems to speed up as you progress though. Well, overall, this game makes a fine tribute to the older games that made Final Fantasy what it is today. I would most definitely recommend it for anyone. I liked FFVII, and I liked FFVIII, but I honestly believe this one surpasses them both. This seems to be the first and last true Final Fantasy game on the Playstation console, and the best Final Fantasy to come along since the original and FFVI.	1
If you like RPGs than you should definitely buy this.  It has adventure, romance, great graphics and much more.  I have only played this one in the Final Fantasy series but I can't imagine the others being better.  If you are a fan of Final Fantasy, than you would probably know the battle between the Final Fantasy series and the Zelda series.  I think that both of them are good, but in different ways.  I like how in Final Fantasy how you can use magic spells but I like Zelda's battle techinque.  I would definitely recommend both games.	1
Final Fantasy IX has to be one of the best video games I've ever played in a long time.  I've played a lot of RPGs, and while I still think Enix has the best storylines, Squaresoft never fails to please its audience with a fine game. After the inconsistent reviews of the outcome of Final Fantasy VIII, I can understand how the sales were rather sluggish at first.  I personally don't hold anything against number VIII, I rather liked it.  But I can also understand why people didn't like VIII, since certain points rather bugged me about it, too. The storyline is unlike any other.  It goes back to its routes in medieval times with dragons, castles, towns and four party members.  Every character has their own class:  Thief, Mage, Fighter, etc.  It kind of takes away the joy of equipping magic in Final Fantasy VII, but also takes away the pain of the constant drawing of the magic in Final Fantasy VIII. And the idea of the main hero being a complete jerk was realized by Square that it's time for a change.  In this one, the hero is some optimistic flirt, which I honestly prefer over the anti-social pessemist... The plot in this game has many more twists than it did in Final Fantasy VIII, in which it was rather linear.  Instead of being hesitant to starting a new game, you'll want to get on it right away after completing it to see certain things that you may have missed that you missed in your previous game. Final Fantasy IX is a very good game for anybody to own.  I honestly think that everybody should have a chance to play it.  It's still debatable about how Zidane's appearance confused people if he was either male or female, but it's still fun to enjoy.	1
Final Fantasy IX continues the trend of excellence that Square has paved.  The game, while keeping with the power of the playstation, is a throwback to the roots of Final Fantasy.  The characters, towns, parts of the story, and even some of the music, are throwbacks to previous Final Fantasy's.  You don't have to be a buff to fully enjoy this game, however. The graphics are wonderful.  The CG sequences are beautifully done.  The backgrounds are nice, and the characters interact with each other wonderfully.  I like how you have a party of 4 instead of 3 which has been the custom in FF VII and FF VIII.  This creates more strategy with the battles.  In one of my favorite throwbacks, you don't get to select who is in your party until late in the game.  Most of the game people come and go from your party a la FF IV.  Also, the characters are much more individualized.  For example, Zidane can steal, Garnet can heal, Vivi can use black magic, etc.  The class system was pioneering for all FF's, so this was a natural choice. The game is not too challenging, but knowledge of the game system is absolutely necessary to keep the challenge down.  The ability system is very neat.  Each piece of equipment lets certain characters learn certain abilities.  Each character has ability crystals and certain abilities can be equipped by using ability crystals, which means only so many abilities can be equipped at one time.  This system is very innovative and not nearly as complex as FF VII's materia system and FF VIII's junction system. FF IX is a wonderful experience and the story doesn't fail to please.  There are so many things you can do on the side.  You will likely spend 10-15 hours doing the chocobo side quest, for example.  This game is well worth the money, as with all FF's.  If you have not experienced this game yet, do so now.	1
I was a little turned off by the characters when I first saw them. None of them are attractive. In my opinion they're all ugly. But these ugly people have some amazing graphics that make them absolutely beautiful. The graphics in this game is a major improvement from Final Fantasy 8 and an unbelievable improvement in storyline. The story is equally as good as in Final Fantasy 7. I actually quit playing FF8 and switched to this one. And I only have one battle left to beat the game. But FF8 is just so boring that I couldn't take it anymore. FF9 keeps my attention every minuet. I love all the characters in this game, the story, the graphics, the fighting, everything. The only thing I dislike is their ugly faces. Mainly Zidane and Dagger. Vivi is cute and enjoyable.	1
I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series, and I found this one to be as good as most of the others (almost as good as my favorite, VII).  If you like Final Fantasy, you'll like this one.	1
Played FF before? You haven't seen anything until you play this one. A must buy for all Rpg fans. It seems like Square is getting better and better. Awesome gameplay, Astonishing cut scenes, a great battle system. Hey, the storyline may not be as good as FF7 but is worth the 60 hours playing it and the money you payed for it.	1
I would rate this game as being better than FF8, but worse than FF7.  I liked the fact that they went back to the old look of FF.  The battle system wasn't all that great, but the music and story were decent enough.  Just go buy it.	1
Ive played alot of rpg's and this is probably my favorite if you don't call zelda an rpg. My favorite thing about this game is that from the moment you start playing it, the suroundings and characters make you feel good. But that deffinatly isn't the only thing that this game has going for it. Each of the summoning attacks are awsome. And steiner and zidane get some cool weapons pretty early in the game and on. You can pick which people you want in your party later in the game. Ive beaten this game 2 times and i found alot of secrets the second time that i didn't find the first time i played. Oh yeah, you can synthesize weapons to make even find was at sometimes the game lagged on the story a bit but bigger weapons than you have before. The only thing that i could then it just picked right back up again, so nothing there that would really take away from the overall game. I wish that i just got this game again so i could experience playing it for the first time again. So, i really urge you to buy this game because it probably my favorite game ever.	1
I'll make it brief. The game is by far the best Final Fantasy for the Playstation and the second best in the nine game series (fans will remember FF6). In honor of FF7, super attacks, called Trance, have been brought back. Basically if the enemy beats on you enough you become super powerful for about two or three turns. The music is absolutely beautiful. Nobuo did an excellant job. The graphics are nice eye-candy and are only rivaled by the beautiful CG animations. The characters are very innovative as well. You can have a black mage, a guy with a monkey tail (why does he have that anyway), or a big freaky-looking guy with red hair, to name three. Abilites and spells are gained from pieces of armor and weapons. The same piece of armor can also hold three different abilities for three different characters making it important to figure out who gets what when. Another good idea as it keeps your characters from becoming god-like very quickly. To all those who liked the old !school version of Final Fantasys, who could like the modern ones all that much, 1-6 will enjoy the nostalgia of this game. I, for one, can only hope that SquareSoft keeps with this idea and keeps the series from becoming more Sci-Fi than medieval. Anyway, I can't say that there is anything negative about this game. So why are you still reading this. Buy it now, Amazon seems to never run out of this game and I'm surprised that it hasn't become a greatest hit yet.	1
FF9 has revived the concept of fantasy.  No more of that futuristic world (FF8).  The story is the greatest I've ever played.  It's EXCELLENT.  After you finish the game, it'll make you think about the story, go over the whole game in your mind.  It's that good.  The game starts out interesting and finishes that way.  The graphics are the BEST.  The FMV is better than FF8!  But this time, the FMV actually help tell the story, and aren't just a visual masterpiece as they were in the past.  The characters are some what deformred....on purpose.  This game is showing things from the past.  You'll be reminded of things from the earlier games.  They have Rufus March (from FF7) playing in the 1st disk and other little things.  The battle system is the same but this time, it's much eaiser than the stupid junction system.  Also, the summons are not as long as they were in FF8, thank GOD!  After a few uses, they just last 1 sec and then they just tell you how much damage it did.  Also, not everyone can use magic.  Some are just physical attackers, and two of them use summons and healing and protective magic and one of them uses offensive magic, like Ice3 and stuff.  Once again, the story is great! It has comedy, romance, everything!  This game is like a fairwell to the old ways and it's just giving a salute to them because I hear FFX is going to be quite different...in a good way.	1
FF8 is absolutely brilliant so get that. FF9 is OK but it isn't even as good as 7, never mind 8. The characters is one of the things that lets this down. I can't wait for 10	-1
Well when I played FFVII, due to a friend's reccomendations, I thought, okay, what is this?  FFVIII was better but the plot was bad and the characters were not involved very well.  Squaresoft did make it all up with FFIX, I decided to also give this one a chance, and I immediately fell in love with it. The characters are more involved, and the CG scenes are awesome and the plot was very detailed and never got boring.  It starts out with the main character, Zidane, and his theif crew planning to kidnap Pricness Garnet of Alexandria, except when they go to get her, she wants to go, but her guard Steiner won't let her go, and he ends up going along whether he wants to or not.  The game gets more involved but I won't tell you anymore. What I liked most was the old style of FF games where only 1 person can do a certain thing (black magic, white magic, stealing, etc.) unlike in FFVII and FFVIII, where all characters can use anything, that makes it too easy, I like a challenge when I play a game. My favorite character, undoubtedly was Vivi, he wasn't that strong using physical attacks, but his black magic was really handy later in the game in difficult boss battles.  My friend, the one who suggested all those other games, didn't want to try it, but I told him how nice it was and he borrowed it and he loved it.  In fact he borrows it whenever he can, and I can't get a chance to play it a second time, and I want to really bad.  Well anyways, I think this game is one of the best FF games on the Playstation, and probably will be the best so far, but I don't think Squaresoft is planning to stop making these games.  I reccomend you rent it and find out for yourself, but I bet you'll buy it as soon as you get the chance.	1
Back to the 4 character battlegroup.  It was a great system, though don't expect much as far as limit break stuff (trances according to FF9), they take forever to fill and happen at odd tiems when you don't want them to, but they don't go away when you die and last longer than 7's.  8's limitbreaks were too powerful and too easy to acquire.  9's weren't all that exciting excpet for Vivi's, which could do the most damage, just shy of 20,000.  But it is definitely one of the most challenging games as far as sub-quests and the "Omega".  Omega being the term referring to the hardest creature in the game.  Emerald and Ruby were the Omega for FF7. The Game itself was great, good story line, a little leaning towards FF8's as far as the interaction between the two itemized characters.  The storyline was a lot more realistic than 8's depsite the obvious fantasy locale and look.  It was a more traditional FF as it didn't have "ultimate" party capabilities.  Like FF7's ability to have everyone cast a double blow of Knights, like 8 where low level characters could still manage to cast high level magic.  It had more like the class system of FF4 and 5 which there in essence with 6 and then exchangable among characters in FF7... virtually nonexistant in 8.  But it does have the original magic names... Firaga, Cura, Panacea. It still doesn't compare to the epic nature of FF7 or the great characters and multiple storylines of FF6 (where the main character was not so obvious), no enemy was quite as cool as Sephiroth and no hidden character was ever as fun as Gogo. I would heavily suggest playing FF8 before this if you already haven't.  For those who love graphics... play the earlier FF's before you play this one, definitely.  For storyline lovers... start out with 5 or 8... placing 4 and 9 afterwards and 6 the 7.  For systems...  Well this is class system with something that worked like 8's junction system except you junctioned items instead of GF's.  4 was clear and cut, 5 was job skills and stuff, 6 and on were almost the same.  It's a great game with hours and hours of side quest play and a lot of hidden things that keep you thinking and running to that players guide.  Playonline does a good job with it.  Some sidequests require you to play for hours just on the sidequest and another requires you to speed your way to the end of the game for secret items.  The card game isn't as functional as 8's or as predicable... in fact the card game could have been left out... but anyway... I also recommend playing Chronocross and Zenogears for a completely different look of play.  As well as Legends/Secret of Mana.  Chronotrigger is a great game as well, if you can find it that is. Zelda 64 fans (both of them) would enjoy Megaman Legends and that series. I would also suggest a good PS for FF8, any of the older PSx's will not perform well and will either freeze up or simply skip some of the coolest CGI's, especially since the Summons like Bahamut and Odin have great appearances. Definitely worth it, thought look out for a few new status effects and some other suprises like ATE and Synth.	1
This game is great besides those borrrinnggg ...frussttrattinngg random battles ...like always!!  Square needs to get a clue and develope a fun battle system for final fantasys. Xenogears had the best battle system but Square STILL decides to go with that ... system they use for final fantasys. Besides that, this game is sweet and is worth buying ... ...and by the way, XENOGEARS RULES!!	1
You've read all the five star reviews. It is undeniable that FF IX has regained the popularity that FF VII once obtained. But,do not be mislead by hype. Heck,this game is the candy-bubblegum pop of all RPGs,the same ol' ... recycled all over again. Take this;a group of various personalities planning to stop the plans of an evil queen from world domination. FF trademark. And too,the return of the dreaded random battle system,the addictive(duh...)card game from FFVIII which promises no rewards but..satisfaction(woohhoo..rare cards! But i can't turn them into rare materials!!).And to compare this to FF VII is absolute ...,even ... First of all,the mini-games are,very,very little compared to FF VII.You don't even have FF IX's own Gold Saucer,and the mini-games are just the card game,the chocobo "hot and cold"(go digging like a ... to upgrade your chocobo and get rare items),and a numb mini-game which involves the big,fat Quina catching frogs hopping around the marshes. What about the gameplay,it's a drab too. You have your typical stereotype Zidane dominating the game and even characters like Vivi,Dagger(what a...dumb name the so hyped translators give)and Eiko,with powerful spells and summons,is deemed useless. Unlike previous Final Fantasies,each character have it's own specific abilities. You have Zidane hacking around with his sword,and absolutely useless in magic(except his trances),Vivi,the good-for-nothing little wizard whose magic skills are incomparable to Zidane's strength(until very,very later in the game),Dagger a.k.a Princess Garnet,with powerful summons(which are useless when you go hop into the last dungeon),Quina a user of blue magic who eats his enemies to learn spells(only a portion of his spells worked).While these characters are like you typical Walt Disney characters or Ben Hur type casts(sarcasm),again compared to Zidane,like extras instead of support characters. And compared to even Square's "flop" FF VIII has more balanced cast of characters. If you think random battle is bearable,like FF VII and FF VIII,this is the most frustrating game after FF VI(for PSX)to date,and prepare for countless hours of head banging moments. There is no moogle charm(FF VI) or Diablos's Enc None (FF VIII)to ease or diminish random encounters. Worse,every battle is just tiresome,with slow loading times and slow ATB bar. This problem even effects your haste spell,where there is no difference in enemy's frequent attacks even when you cast it. Finally,this "light hearted" Final Fantasy is just not really funny. There is a handful of situations that will only gives you a mere sneer in you face. The dialogue,even with good translators,is lifeless,bland,and lacked with emotion. And it is time for Nobou Uematsu to retire,because 70% of the game's soundtrack is pure ...,with MIDIs still his favourite tool. Overall,if you want good graphics..only good graphics and a pure Square fanboy(i know almost everyone do),don't go cursing at your fellow FF fanatics when you buy and beat the game.	-1
Final Fantasy 9 stands right up there with all my favorite RPGs----Final Fantasy 7, Breath of Fire 3, Chrono Cross, Legend of Legaia, and Tales of Destiny. The characters are wonderful, and the storyline is a lot better than the confusing one in its predecessor, Final Fantasy 8. The towns are great, from big kingdoms to Lindblum and Alexandria to small farm towns like Dali Village or secret towns like Daguerrero. The bosses are quite difficult, depending on some, like Gizamaluke (if you're Level 15 or higher he's a breeze, but not for me he wasn't, and I was Level 14), Ark, Ozma, and Trance Kuja. The summons, now called Eidolons return as in every game with some new ones such as Madeen. Favorites return like Shiva, Ramuh, and Ifrit. But ones from FF8, such as Diablos, do not make their triumphant return, but Hades from FF7 makes his return as, not a summon, but an optional boss. Boy is he tough. This game also houses the airships that make every Final Fantasy game great, and the Chocobos and Mogs return as well. Even references to other FF games are loaded in this game.   This game rocks.	1
I'll admit that I'm a RPG gamer today because of Final FantasyVII, the RPG that aimed for the jugular of Americanmainstream. Squaresoft's latest addition to the Final Fantasy serieswas probably the biggest surprise I've had all year. Being used to therather mainstream FF7 and FF8, I was put off by this one's cutesyappearing characters and fantasy setting. But still, I purchased it,not thinking it would ever surpass FF7. If you are a gamer that hadthe same mentality as I did, buy it anyway, give it 2 hours and youwill be connected with the game in a way FF7 and FF8 never achieved todo. Instead of taking a futuristic, cinematic approach in story withsomewhat shallow characters, Square decided to go for the deep,3-dimensional characters in a fantasy setting. Never mind theirstrange appearances, like Zidane having a tail or Quina, well... theseare some of the best characters to ever appear in a Playstationgame. However, the tradeoff seems to be a ho-hum storyline in whichsome guy wants to destroy the world and your the ones who have to saveit. This is my main, and only, complaint. Square makes up for itthough, by taking a somewhat different approach to it. Even though thestory is same-old same-old, it won't feel like it, thanks to thewonderfully designed characters. Overall, FF9 is a masterpiece noPSX gamer should be without. The graphics are astounding, the gameplayis fun, and the characters are the best yet. If this plays like howall the old-school Final Fantasies are like, then Square shouldre-release more of them, not just 5 and 6.	1
After over a year of waiting for this title, I feel dissapointed. Don't get me wrong, on it's own, this is a great game. Compared to many games out there, this is one of the best, an all time great. But compared to Final Fantasy VII and VIII, this is a somewhat poor effort. I am not a Final Fantasy follower, the first one I played was VII and the only other one I've played is VIII, so as far as this review is concerned, I will only be talking about the new generation of the game. The graphics are good. The FMV sequences are breathtaking. However, in both cases, they are no different to the quality of graphics and FMV in FFVIII. Infact, with the cartoon-style characters, you could even say that the graphics on FFVIII are better. The storyline is up to the usaual high standard, not as good as VII, equal with VIII. The sound is virtually the same as the previous two adventures also. The game itself has introduced an ability system, not complicated but more stupid. Why can only 2 characters use summons? Limit breaks are not as good or easy to get. Zidane looks like a girl! The characters are not as good as they could have been and nowhere near as good as the cast of FFVII and FFVIII. Don't get me wrong - I absolutely love the game. It is in my top ten all time favourite games. It is a great title. However, compared to previous games, this is not as good. If you're new to the series, buy 7 then 8. Don't buy 9 first because then 7, WHEN you buy it, won't blow you away (as much). Playing 9 I didn't have the same passion to play it. With the other titles I was on them for ages, hours and hours at a time but when it came to 9, I just found it irritating and annoying - Like I'm saying I can't be bothered to play this. It's not as addictive, if you've played the others anyway, and not as gripping - it still keeps you glued to the screen but not in the same way that VII and VIII did. Maybe I'm getting bored of the series after playing VII and VIII to death. You decide - in the end this is just my opinion. BTW: The card game 'Tetra Master' is crap - TRIPLE TRIAD IS MUCH BETTER.	1
Ok let me start off by saying that Final Fantasy 6 or 3 here in the U.S. is the best ever.  This game is tied for 2nd place with Final Fantasy 4 or 2 in the U.S.  Theres just so much in this game that i love.  The artwork has gone back to the series roots.  FF7 and 8 had too much a futuristic look to them.  This game get back to the hardcore fantasy world with knights, castles, wizards, and swords.  The cinematic scenes are awesome as well.  But for hardcore RPGers like myself the most important aspects are story, and gameplay.  The storyline is strong and makes a great deal of sense.  You actually care about the characters you are playing with, unlike FF8.  The battle system has gone back to the series roots as well.  There are now 4 characters on screen during battle, unlike 3 in FF7 and 8.  Each characters plays differently and has unique abilities, unlike FF8 when everyone was the same.  There is actually armor, experience points and money in this game and they mean something, again unlike FF8.  Some argue that this game is meant for children.....if they did they obviously haven't played it.  This game can get tough at times, and even the most hardcore RPGer will see the Game Over screen a few times.  This game is SOOOOO deep.  Unless you cheat and use a guide then this game has major replay value for someone who likes to find everything.  I could have done without the silly card game, but i guess some people just love collecting stuff. In conclusion if you love the Final Fantasy series, but are in doubt about buying another one after the debacle that was Final Fantasy 8, trust me buy this game and you won't be disappointed	1
Fian Fantasy 9 has go to be the best one out of the series so far.  The graphics on this one are far superior to the previous outings, as they seem more crisp and and there is more attention to detail.  The control method is the same as in the previous ones so any of the old fans will be able to jump right in from the start.  There are plenty of new weapons and new magic which eill keep any fan happy until Fianl Fantasy 10 comes out on Playstation 2 (I cant wait)	1
As many people already know, this is the final Final Fantasy for the Playstation, and as such, it is a summation of the past 8 games in the series.  The producers made this game with this intent in mind.  So you're not going to see anything incredibly revolutionary, like the (at the time) incredible graphics of FF 7 or the crazy gameplay system of FF8.  Instead, what you will find is a simply well-made, enjoyable game. There has been lots of controversy over the quality of the Playstation Final Fantasy games, and my interpretation of this will be no different.  This game seemed like the best in the series to me, since it was a well made game.  There were no screwed up battle systems like in FF8, the plot was actually consistent and made sense, unlike FF7, and the graphics were in general great.  In terms of craftsmanship, the only Final Fantasy which is close (if not better) is FF 6. The gameplay was excellent.  The item-ability system was reminiscent of the Esper system in FF6, the trance system of the limit system in FF7 and FF8, and the synthesis system from FF8.  All these elements come together to make a game that is fun to play.  While the random battles can become a drag, the sheer graphical quality of the fights is enough to make at least the first few ones in each area enjoyable. The world map is also the largest in the series.  While there aren't multiple world maps, there are enough areas in the game to keep you occupied.  This means there are plenty of side quests to do, in addition to being able to simply explore lots of places.  Each individual town is larger, on average, than any of those in the FF series which came before. Graphically speaking, this game is incredible.  Not just in the technical aspects, but also in the creativity exercised by the artists in this game.  No other Final Fantasy comes close to the wonderful way the artists were able to make this world come alive.  Every new area is shockingly refreshing and new.  The summons, like FF8, are beautiful, but they aren't long. The music was pretty good.  If I had to pick a part of the game that was weakest, this would be it.  But it still good, and much of it did a good job of accompanying what was happening on the screen.  It's especially wonderful to listen to various pieces of music after finishing the game and reminiscing about those parts. Finally, the story was superb.  It made sense and what happened near the end of the game was especially interesting.  If anything, this game is worth buying just to see Vivi.  He's the most incredible character in the entire Final Fantasy series. You aren't going to find anything revolutionary here.  Instead, what you'll find is a well-made, enjoyable game.  This is the last Final Fantasy of its kind, and like those before it, it doesn't disappoint!	1
Don't get me wrong! I love the Final Fantasy series but Square kinda rushed this game! In the Final Fantasy series, I would have to say that Final Fantasy 3 tops rhem all, ( Unfortunitly)! But This game is pretty fun! But the caracters are very goofy looking and there is too much story line and most of it is not so good! I like this one alot more then Final Fantasy 8 though! Unlike No. 8, every caracter has their own abilties and that was a major improvement over Final Fantasy 8! On Fianal Fantasy 8, the ONLY differnce in the chacters is thier limit breaks! Wich was very sad! None of them have a special feature to seperate them! In Final Fantasy 9 however, each character gets differnt spells, skills and soforth. But this one resembles No .3 the most out of 8 & 7! I don't care much at all for 3D graphics in Role Playing games! It kinda ruins the fun! But the graphics in Final Fantasy 9 are bareable! The coloring is fantastic and the battle backrounds are cool! The game play hours were kinda dissapointing too, but they are pretty good! Another down side of this game is it is too easy! The enemys and bosses are jokes! It is not as near as chalanging as it should be! But as the game as a whole it is fun and enjoyable! The dudes you sommon in this game are cool looking and they are not to long like in Final Fantasy 7 and 8. I would recomend this one over Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy 8!	1
Square takes the player back to the style and mentality of FFVI and earlier--the sword-and-sorcery, the differentiation of character types and weaponry--and mixes it with the state-of-the-PlayStation graphics for which they're best-known.  Pluses:  The characters.  There are more differences of opinions between the good guys then there are confrontations with the bad guys.  The scorecard keeps changing until you're not sure who's on your side and who isn't.  Add to that the "guiding statements" that Square presents for each character (Zidane:  "VIRTUE - You don't need a reason to help someone") and you've got quite a volatile mix of personalities.  The cut scenes.  Simply astounding...it's not possible to over-praise the CG work that Square does on the FF titles.  The combat system.  Familiar, yet different.  Easy to learn whether or not you've ever played an FF game before.  Moogles and Chocobos.  The Moogles figure in no fewer than two of the side quests, and Chocobo Hot-and-Cold is a fun way to acquire some of the more obscure treasures.  Minuses:  Slow start.  Almost an hour of game time goes by before it actually matters what you have equipped, what spells you can use, and what those little green gems are.  I enjoyed getting to know the characters, and laughed out loud the first time I played the swordfight between Zidane and Blank, but I found myself waiting for the real meat of the game to kick in...the part that my participation actually affected.  Forward, forward, forward.  The game constantly drives you along its linear story path--there are a not many places where you can just break from the action and go explore the world.  Often, the effort to turn around and explore an area you just came from is rewarded by the character being yanked from your control and saying something on the order of "I think escaping takes top priority right now!" or "Steiner has everything under control."  It makes it difficult to get out and put in a proper effort to achieve the side quests and optional bosses.  All in all, a spectacular effort from Square, easily replayable and worth the time invested.  "Normal" play time is somewhere around 60 hours, but you can easily top 100 if you probe this broad, deep world to its fullest.  If half-stars were possible, I'd go 4.5 because of the two minuses, but...ehn, give 'em something more for presentation, I say: graphics and music unparalleled in any game.	1
... in comparison with the other final fantasies, this is just below par. -The character development for this isn't as clean as say... VIII -The Eidolon/Summon feature is a little shaky. -The ending is a tad disappointing -The soundtrack is not Uematsu's best but... -it's still very very fun to play -the visuals are, as usual, stunning (FMVs... normal gameplay) -Although not Uematsu's best, the soundtrack gets better over time (go pick up the piano tracks after you're done- they're marvelous) -the story is good -the references to old final fantasies are fun IV and VIII still remain at the top of my list, but this installment in the series is still very very good. If you've got some time, pick this up.	1
Final Fantasy 9 is Squaresoft's latest sequel to their long running, extremely popular series of role playing games.  The series returns to it's roots this time around.  No high-tech societies filled with laser guns and flying cars here...just traditional dungeons and dragons medievil weapon battles, ect.  Thankfully, the drawing-spells-from-enemies feature that was in Final Fantasy 8 is replaced with the old style magic points system.  While some of the characters are new and original, others seem like watered down versions of past ones (Kuja is similar to Sephiroth from FF7).  The card game is back also, although it plays a less significant role this time.  The bottom line is, you'll see many features that are new, but you'll also see things that are tired and old...like the names of the summon characters and spells for example (I don't understand why that in every Final Fantasy Square has refused to change them). If you are a long time fan of the series, there's enough here to keep you playing.  In my opinion, Final Fantasy 9 is better than 8, but not quite as good as 7.	1
This game is great. It goes back to the style of the older games (1-5 for the most part) with very little of the technological influence, where magic is powerful and makes you drool. I've liked all of the numbered ones to some extent (1-6 were great, 7 was pretty good, but 8 really lacked in too many areas) but this one is my favorite. This one combines learning from what you have equipped (as with espers in FF6) with a distinct party role for each member (like in FF1 and FF2/FF4). Magic is good again (it ... in FF8) and summons are cool, and good in a pinch, but not something you'd want/be able to use in every battle. I liked that for the first time really you could do quite well with no extra effort to gain levels, but with all the cool abilities there's a strong incentive to do just that. Also the plot is good, although still quite linear...but it's really very difficult to fix that in a video game. For the first time in years I've felt drawn into the story by a video game, and it's extremely refreshing. This is a very good game. If you didn't like FF8, I'd recommend this one. It's almost completely opposite. If you liked any of the previous ones, especially FF2/4 or FF3/6, play this one, because you will love it.	1
In my opinion, SquareSoft is one of the greatest video game companies and their Final Fantasy games are the best RPGs you can get.  Of all the games in the series, the latest entry Final Fantasy IX is my favorite. With its ninth installment, Square has gone back to a medieval theme and is using a more colorful graphics scheme.  This differs from Final Fantasy VII's and VIII's futuristic settings and their dark, realistic graphics, but I always did like the castles and colors of the first Final Fantasies, so Final Fantasy IX suits me fine.  Also, it has some of the best music I've ever heard--even better than Chrono Cross'.  And the story is more complex and interesting than Final Fantasy VIII's; it's more like VII's where the characters are a mystery and each has his or her own story to tell.  And since the characters are developed well, I found that I liked practically every one of them--in Final Fantasy VIII I only really liked Squall and Rinoa. Final Fantasy IX has my favorite battle system of the series.  First, Magic Points are back, so you can't just keep casting spells to your heart's content; you'll first have to make sure you have enough Magic Points.  Another welcome return is the challenge of battles; even normal enemies can come close to defeating you, whereas in Final Fantasy VII and VIII, only the bosses ever pose a threat.  Like Finaly Fantasy VI for the PlayStation (Final Fantasy III for the Super Nintendo), each character has his or her own special ability.  For instance: the main character Zidane is the only one that can steal items from enemies, and Vivi, a young Black Mage, is the only one gifted in using Black Magic.  To teach the characters more "Action Abilities" you'll have to equip them with items that harness new powers.  Here's how it works: say Vivi is equipped with a staff that has the "Action Ability" Thunder.  As long as Vivi has that staff equipped, he'll be able to use the spell Thunder, but if he removes the staff, he will no longer have its powers.  So he will have to battle with that staff until he learns Thunder.  Once the powers are learned, he can equip a different weapon and be on his way to learning its powers while still retaining the spell Thunder. The characters will also learn "Support Abilities" from items.  These are abilities that support the characters during battles and are always in effect, meaning you do not have to use them first.  But you can't have all your "Support Abilities" active at once since you are limited by your supply of "Magic Stones."  Each character has a certain number of these stones, and the number will slowly increase as the character levels up.  You equip the required amount of these stones to each "Support Ability" that you wish to be active.  For example: Zidane has 11 "Magic Stones" and the "Support Abilities" Counter (randomly counters an enemy's attack) and Antibody (protects the character from being poisoned).  Since Counter requires 8 stones to be equipped and Antibody requires 4, Zidane can only equip one until he levels up and gains another stone.  This system gives you a nice opportunity to customize your characters. In battles characters may also perform special maneuvers once they go into a "Trance."  This is similar to Final Fantasy VII's "Limit Break."  Each character has a "Trance Gauge" that slowly fills up as he receives damage from enemies.  Once the gauge is filled, the character enters a "Trance" and can perform his own personal ability.  If Vivi enters a "Trance," he gains, for that battle, the ability to cast two spells in the same turn. Throughout the game there are many events that you can get into--from jumping rope, to collecting cards, to even delivering letters.  But my favorite has to be treasure-hunting with a chocobo.  (If you're new to the series, a chocobo is a birdlike creature that serves as a horse.)  Sometime during the game, you'll get a chocobo, which will be able to use its beak to dig up "Chocographs" (treasure maps) in certain areas.  These "Chocographs" tell you the whereabouts of treasures by showing you a small picture of an area on the World Map and giving a hint to its location.  But your chocobo may not be able to get to the location until it gains the ability to cross certain terrains.  At first your chocobo can only cross over plains, but as it finds more treasures it will gain the ability to cross shallow waters, mountains, etc. Final Fantasy IX is definitely my favorite in the series and may even be my favorite game ever.  With its likeable characters, improved battle system, and fun mini-games, I think anybody who enjoys RPGs will have some of their greatest gaming moments playing this title.  Well done, Square!	1
This is a such a great game. It carries on the ATB(Active Time Bar). It has more of an old school look to it. You play as a thief and help aid a black mage, an eidolin adept, and a princess. Who knows what kind of misadventures you might get into. Play this game and you will find out just how good it is. Even if it doesn't quite live up to Final Fantasy 7.	1
Final Fantasy Nine is probably almost as good as Final Fantasy Seven,and I am NOT KIDDING. The characers are extremely lovable and have a lot of depth to them, especially Vivi, and within the first 10 minutes of Vivi's gameplay you will know what I mean. The main character might be slightly annoying in the beginning (he is somewhat of a whiner) but he changes IMMENSELY after the first disk. So don't let the review that says Zidane is annoying stop you!  The story seems very simple in the beginning, but it grows to be more complex as you journey your way through each of the game's four disks. Saving the world turns into saving memories, the world, people, and possibly another world....There are many plot twists about every single one of the games characters, that you will be amazed over and over again, and finally just left to die in shock. But you will die happy.  The graphics in the game are stellar, with some places having full motion video in the backgrounds. The newer fantasy-esque environments conquer the drab and boring enviornemnts of FF8. The cinema cut-scenes are the same excellent and stunning as FF8, not much has changed here. The music is good, and keeps the beat with the story and characters. The ending theme is the best, in my opinion. Fans of the music of FF8 may think otherwise.  My only complaint of the game is that its too short. Lasting 40 hours, it doesnt have enough events too get the characters prepared for the Final Dungeon (which led to me leveling up for 3 hours). If you are a fan of Final Fantasy 7, get this game. If you arent, get it anyway.	1
The first game I had ever played in the series was FF2 forsnes, and it was great. Although it was nearly ..., my sister and I saved enough to buy it. Then I got FF3 as soon as it came out, and so on. I even bought a playstation just to get FF7. FF9 is a big improvement over FF8, but it still isn't as great as the masterful FF7. Even though I started out with the fantasy-type quest of the early games, I really loved the dark, science fiction tone of FF7. Maybe thats one of the reasons why FF9 doesn't seem as good to me. I still like it though. It does remind me of the old snes days, even with its superior graphics. The ability system is a definate improvement over FF8's complicated junction system, but it still can be confusing at times, as you are constantly changing weapons and abilites. I really liked the materia system best. On a better note, the world map is really good, with its mist and upper levels. The world map of FF8 was very cheap. Sure, it was huge, but a lot of it was just plain empty. The entire southern continent (centra) had almost nothing on it! Just a house and a wierd ruin. Not if FF9. They don't cheat like that. As for the battle system though, i think it just moves along too slow. The ATB gauge is like a snail, and battles can take a long time. Still, you have to gain levels a lot more in this game than in other FF's. It is noticably harder. Don't get me wrong, I love the game. I just think it is a little flawed. Don't let me discourage you, if you are a fan of the series you still must have this game.	1
I remember the days when I would sit at home all day playing Final Fantasy VII, wether it was maxing out my characters stats or getting deep into the storyline it was one of my favorite games that I happened to play more than once.  Then it happened.......Final Fantasy VIII tromps onto the market and greatly dissapoints many Final Fantasy fans with its futuristic plot, and its overly complicated plot.  Getting back to Final Fantasy IX, wether you have played a Final Fantasy game or you haven't this game is a sure shot at fun.  SquareSoft makes a great recovery from Finaly Fantasy XIII with the fantasy side of the game that we all love versus the futuristic.  This game has great cinemas, and only people that know magic can use it!  (finally makes sense....)  I am going to go out on a limb here and say that this may even better than Final Fantasy VII!  Check this title out.  Good luck shopping/browsing!	1
This game is just amazing, the best in the series on the playstation, but nowhere compared to Final Fantasy 2 in the super nintendo. This game brings such a smile to my face when Final Fantasy 8 almost made me cry after such an extreme dissapointment! The characters are wonderful, desinged by Yoshitaka Amano. The battle system is great and the plot returened to when Final Fantasy is suppossed to take place, not in the future (blech) If only the movie that is coming out wasn't in the future. P.S. (it is scary how much the main character Zidane looks so much like me!	1
I was ready to hate this game when I first played it, because Final Fantsy VIII was so overly complicated and the story wasn't even understandable.  I belived Final Fantasy VII was going to be the best of the Final Fantasys until I had played the 9th installment.  The story isn't the best, but far better then most RPGs now days.  The interesting characters draw you in and you don't want to stop playing until you find out what will happen to them.  The graphics, while not as realilistic as 8, are just as good, if not better, with amazing backrounds and good chacter models.  The musical score is decent, and I belive most would not complain, as It is far better then Chrono Cross or Legend of Dragoon.  The Juction system has been discarded for a new, simple system that almost any gamer can get in to.  The return of mini games is a welcome suprise as well as a new card game supierior to Triple Triad in most ways.  The only big flaw I can see is the random battles which may have been ramped up some, but other then that, there is nothing major that takes away from the game.  If you like RPGs then buy it.  If not, then at least rent it.	1
Over the years Square has brought the best RPGs out to a system (exluding the Lunar series ^^) I haven't played a bad Final Fantasy game yet and 9 did not dissapoint me. This game is simply amazing. The graphics are awesomely well done and the cut scene CG cinemas will leave your jaw weighted to the floor. The enviornments are lush and detailed. The amount of characters in a party has also been upped to 4 from the usual three. The story is also switched back to a medieval time, but of course you cant forget the semi-futuristic elements such as airships and giant steam powered cities (Think Final Fantasy 3). The story is simply engrossing. It will keep you hooked until you have beaten it with great twists and turns. I have 2 gripes that I have though. One, I think the main character, Zidane, isn't as memorable as Cloud, Lock, Squall, Cecil or any of the others heroes from previous games. Characters in the game are very well done. But Zidane I think was the wrong type of hero, just my opinion though. Character developement and backround in the game is awesome though. Square quality. The other gripe is the shortness of the game. I had the game for about a week and a half and I was at the 3rd disk. Maybe it was because I was hooked though =). My suggestion is by this game, everything about it is awesome and If you love Final Fantasy then this game won't dissapoint.	1
All good things come to an end. However, it doesn't look like the Final Fantasy steamroller is gonna stop anytime soon. The last FF game for the original PlayStation is a truly stellar one. The story revolves around a pirate/thespian who kidnaps a princess (go figure) who actually WANTS to be captured, a knight of the royal family who follows the princess Garnet everywhere, and a black mage which looks a little like Orko from the old He-Man cartoons. All the goodies are here: MPs, spells, summons (YES!), and of course, more monsters than you could shake a stick at. If you've played and enjoyed the other games in this series, you'll get to like this one immediately. The newest additions include doing away with Save Points (you gotta find a Mog to save your progress. If you don't know what a Mog is, shame on you.) The other changes include the return of the Limit Break meter (called the "trance" meter here) and the all-new ATE (Active Time Event) where you can see what two or more different characters are doing at the exact same time as you. Your choices in the game influence these characters later on. Cool, huh? Okay, let's do the usual run-down: Graphics -5 stars- the best on PlayStation, especially with the CG cutscenes. Sweet magic attacks. Sound- 5 stars- everything's there, including some music from FF 7 & 8. Gotta love it. Control- 5 stars- let's face it: the controls are always the same, but it's a good thing here. Fun-ocity- 5 stars- Oh yeah, you're gonna like this one. Plan on losing touch with a few loved ones (like your family, boyfriend/girlfriend, family pet) before you're done with this one. OVERALL: 5 Stars. For the FINAL Final Fantasy for PlayStation 1, what a way to go. Pick this one up if you are a fan of games in particular.	1
When people who play video games hear the words Final Fantasy, even those who don't like that type of game have to admit that the series is very cool.  It's creators have a history of Taking beautiful fantasy, Sci-fim type of stories, mixing them with interesting and beautifully developed charachters, putting them into fantastic and epic adventures and battles.  Final Fantasy IX Scores in every way.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, (Really) your jaw will drop at some of the events that happen. You will not be able to shut the game off. to those who've never played and RPG, I say this: if you like reading, and you like video games, you must play this game.  Most RPG's are like fantasy novels turned into videogames.  And Final Fantasy is to video games, what the sowrd of truth series it to fantasy novels.  simply the best.  You save princesses, fight dragons, bring evil doer's to justice, and learn about the meaning of life, love, and beloging.  I't not everybodies cup of tea.  RPG's, even the best one's are an acquired taste.  But should you have the taste for this type of adventure, you'll dig it the most. For those of you that know the type of game, get it now.  It will rob you of sleep, it will keep you from finishing homework, it is truly a captivating game filled with wizards, warriors, acts of courage and sacrifice, beautiful charachter development, mystery, chocobo's, Ultima, Masamune, crystals, and some dude named Cid.  For those of you not in the know, Cid is the Q (From James bond) of Final Fantsy. And, of course the graphics a captivating. the music; inspired. the story; a work of beauty.  The battles; epic and exciting. Ant the villans are powerful and deep.  But these things are final fantasy staples.  This is the best Final Fantasy ever.	1
Final Fantasy IX was a pretty big release during it's time.  Coming out after the ultra success of Final Fantasy VII and VIII it had some pretty big shoes to fill.  Final Fantasy IX ended up being a throwback of sorts.  It tried it's hardest to mix the best of the old with the best of the new.  If you go into Final Fantasy IX understanding the old school appeal and that the plot, in jokes and cliches are all intentional, then Final Fantasy IX is going to wow you in all sorts of ways.  If, however, you aren't prepared for this... if you don't understand that Final Fantasy IX was meant to be a tribute to the series up until this point (and many younger Final Fantasy fans typically don't) then you might be scratching your head as to what Final Fantasy IX was actually about.  Final Fantasy IX has a fairly simple story.  It's not quite as far reaching as other Final Fantasy.  Instead Final Fantasy IX has tones things down, going more for breathing some old school goodness into some of it.  A group of thieves known as Tantalus are on their way to Alexandria to kidnap Princess Garnet.  Zidane and his allies are put to the task.  The pesky, overprotective Steiner gets in the way.  As this is going on, a Black Mage named Vivi is running through town trying to see the play "I Want to Be Your Canary."  These three sets begin Final Fantasy IX.  And at the climax of the play they all come together where certain questions come about.  It turns out Garnet wants to be kidnapped because she wants to know what her mother, the Queen, is up to.  Steiner joins because he has sworn to protect the Princess.  Vivi gets mixed up into things, but soon begins to question his origins and where he came from.  Final Fantasy IX has a good story, but the pacing of the story in and of itself is very slow.  What helps the pacing along is that the characters are actually quite well developed.  They each have their own distinctive personalities.  More than that, however, Final Fantasy IX puts a lot of effort into the characters by introducing the idea of Active Time Events (ATE).  When wondering around town you can sometimes press the select button to see what your other characters are doing.  Sometimes this impacts events that happen (for instance a character might get an item in an ATE).  But really, what helps this out is that we begin to learn more about the characters.  Final Fantasy IX has other things that make the story pace a lot slower than the previous Final Fantasy games before it (most notably Final Fantasy VI, VII and VIII).  There will be times when, upon paying tribute to older Final Fantasy titles (most notably I, II and III) there will be moments where you may need to go and perform certain tasks for absolutely no reason at all.  Or because you have to find one particular item to get through.  There are moments in Final Fantasy IX when doing some of these things will add absolutely nothing to the story whatsoever.  Or moments where certain things will feel like a chore.  At one point with Zidane you are tasked with running around a city to find three potions to help change the form of someone back into a human.  Upon getting the three potions (which may or may not take you some time depending on if you know exactly where they are or not) it doesn't work.  It's time spent away from the story and time spent away from pressing things forward.  The tribute to the old school nature of 80's RPGs can work (just look at Dragon Quest VIII) but there are moments in Final Fantasy IX where even for the most old school fan it can be far fetched.  There are lots of twist and turns in the story of Final Fantasy IX.  It's simple, but there are surprises.  Again, from an old school standpoint some of them are going to be... strange to younger fans (particularly those who started with VII) as you'll feel like some twists and turns will come out of no where.  And while Final Fantasy IX always manages to somehow bring it together, you'll never get the sense that it was done in a logical way.  Again, this is because much of what Final Fantasy IX does is paying tribute to the franchise.  There will be many a moment in Final Fantasy IX's story where you'll see a twist coming a mile away.  But these moments are intentional.  To this day even some older Final Fantasy fans can't seem to figure out why Final Fantasy IX has so many cliches or obvious moments.  It has caused Final Fantasy IX to be one of the most loved and most hated Final Fantasy titles as a result (though when we were finally able to get our hands on all the Final Fantasy games it became clear that the attitudes toward Final Fantasy IX have shifted to being far more positive).  The story, overall, is good, but if your first foray into Final Fantasy was the seventh installment and you didn't bother to play any game before the fifth one, many of Final Fantasy IX's references, jokes and tributes will fly right over your head and be lost on you.  At the very least the humor holds up.  One of the best parts about Final Fantasy IX is how emotionally investing the story can be.  Since the release of Final Fantasy VII, the dark, mysterious and brooding character has been a trope favorite within the JRPG genre.  So it's actually kind of nice to see Final Fantasy IX have a more lighthearted cast.  The ensemble cast here is certainly better to get along with than Final Fantasy VII or VIII before it.  Despite that there are MANY emotional moments in Final Fantasy IX.  The lighthearted characters doesn't exactly equate to a light hearted plot.  Final Fantasy IX is easily one of the darkest in the series.  Everything about the story aside, the gameplay of Final Fantasy IX is pretty straightforward.  Like previous games, it utilizes the ATB battle system.  Every character has a gauge that, when full, allows them to select an attack and then watch their actions perform.  As with everything else about Final Fantasy IX, it's much more simplified than the three or four games that came before it.  This is also true when one considers the abilities.  Final Fantasy VII and VIII had some particularly interesting systems at play.  Final Fantasy VII had the materia system which allowed some really unique customization.  And Final Fantasy VIII had the junction system in which you could tailor any character to be exactly what you wanted them to be.  Both systems were complex enough that there were whole tutorials in each one built to help the player grasp them.  Final Fantasy IX opts for a far more simple ability system.  Each character falls into a clear "job" in the similar vane that they did in Final Fantasy VI.  Zidane is obviously a thief, Garnet is obviously a white mage, Vivi is a black mage, etc.  And the game makes it very clear just who is what (Steiner is dressed as a knight... I wonder what his "job" is...).  Every character dresses as their trope.  It's so obvious what they should be doing in battle.  Similar to Final Fantasy VI, each character has something they can call their own in battle.  Learning other abilities is also simplistic.  Each time you change up your equipment they each come with abilities.  Your weapons, armor and accessories all teach you abilities for characters to use.  For instance, a Flame Staff will allow Vivi to learn Fira.  If you keep it equipped long enough, Vivi will master Fira and be able to use it without having to equip the staff.  Each character has a set amount of abilities they can equip which increases with their level.  This means that, unlike previous Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy IX makes it much harder to have a ridiculously overpowered party.  If you're the type that doesn't like grinding, Final Fantasy IX will (eventually) put you in the position where you'll have to.  You need to leave certain weapons and armor equipped to learn some abilities that may protect you from statuses or learn new spells.  Not every character grows equally, though.  A character might take 20 AP to learn one ability while the other will need 40 for that same ability.  It's not a unique or engaging system in any way, but it will keep you busy and grinding from time to time.  You can buy weapons, armor and accessories in shops, but you can also synthesize them to create better and more powerful weapons as well.  Final Fantasy IX doesn't make it easy to get an overpowered party in quite the same manner that VI, VII and VIII did.  Final Fantasy IX is going to make you work just a little harder for that.  On the other hand, it does make each character stand out in some way.  Where as Final Fantasy VII and VIII had limit breaks, Final Fantasy IX does away with that and instead puts in the idea of "Trance."  When characters take enough damage they will go into a trance state where their abilities are enhanced and they deal more damage (and take less).  At first this is an interesting system, but you'll quickly lose interest in it.  While it's pretty cool the first few times some things about it will annoy you.  The first and most obvious is that Trance activates automatically.  You have no control over that.  And yes, there will be plenty of battles (normal battles) where it's wasted and you might not get to actually utilize it.  If you go into a trance state and the battle ends your meter will start at 0.  It's no where near as interesting as the limit breaks from Final Fantasy VII and VIII or as useful as the desperation attacks from VI.  There's little wrong with Final Fantasy IX's battle system.  The only real downside to it is the amount of grinding that must be done.  It not always fun to have to equip lesser armor and weapons just for the sake of learning an ability.  Final Fantasy IX has a story that will take it's time moving from point A to point B.  It's a shame that at times the player will also have to slow down to get through it.  Final Fantasy IX is rarely (if ever) in a hurry.  This is actually not always a bad thing.  It allows for more character development and interaction and allows the story to focus much more strongly on its characters.  From a production standpoint Final Fantasy IX is one of the best looking Playstation games around.  Again, paying tribute the character models evoke more of the style of sprites than they do more human like models.  This means characters have some pretty big heads and they appear shorter than you might expect.  Games like Final Fantasy VIII, Vagrant Story and Chrono Cross were more concerned about making their characters look as humanlike as possible on the Playstation, but Final Fantasy IX settles for a more "cute" look.  It's nostalgic and nice.  Where Final Fantasy IX really shines, however, is the music.  It is unquestionably one of the greatest compositions that series composer Nobuo Uematsu has done.  The themes are great and the emotional attachment they show can't be matched by much else.  Final Fantasy IX will show you just why Nobuo Uematsu is a master at what he does.  There's a lot of charm here that helps compliment the tone Final Fantasy IX presents.  As a child I recall not being very fond of Final Fantasy IX (at the time I had only played VI, VII and VIII before it) and I suppose you could say I didn't "get it."  As an adult, however, I have found Final Fantasy IX to be a nice little trip.  The story is a little slow at times, and much of it is going to be sillier than the games before it.  However, the characters and world around it are pretty good.  They make the journey worth it.  And now, having experienced every Final Fantasy before IX, it was easier to understand why it was done in the manner which it was.  There are certain little problems I have with it, but nothing so serious that it ruins the enjoyment or fun of what is easily one of the best Final Fantasy titles in the series.	1
It's thanksgiving break, Im stuck at college and all of my friends went home.  God no this isn't a bad thing, I went and bought this game and immediately went to the liquor store.  I plan on sitting in my room and playing this game all week.  The graphics are simply amazing.  Arguably the best of the series.  The game play is self explanitory, for gods sake it's Final Fantasy.  Every Final Fantasy Game I have played didn't impress me much at first, but I found myself sitting in front of the TV for hours on end, screwing up my sleep schedule and calling professors pretending I was sick or someone had died.  Yes, that sounds pathetic, but that's what these games do to us.  The only thing that I am not impressed with so far is the music.  The past games in the series set the bar so high, they cannot top themselves anymore.	1
Final Fantasy IX goes back to its cartoony roots, setting aside the gorgeous characterizations of FF8. While FF8 was like playing characters in a well done anime movie, FF IX has you controlling rounded, playful looking characters that give the game more kid-appeal. The graphics in general are stellar. The opening sequence, the animation of water, of birds, of fire, and of other things normally challenging to an animation crew are amazing to watch. Gameplay graphics are quite good, although at times the pretty backgrounds can make finding an object or figuring out an exit to a room a bit difficult. FF IX is a bit restrictive in its characters. Your thief, mage, knight, and "princess healer" each need to pretty much specialize within their class. Each can find special items to help them learn and grow, and choose how to aim their growth. This can be done automatically for new players, or with great attention to detail for the more advanced gamers. Battle is also nice in this way - beginners can have the game pause while they choose exactly which magic to fire at their enemies, while those wanting a challenge can have the entire battle run in real time, depending on quick reflexes and fast fingers. In addition to the players, there are also 'helpers', or Eidolons, which add to the drama of a battle. Active Time Events (ATE) will show up occasionally to fill you in on the storyline, showing short movies of things happening elsewhere in the game. These are well done - if you've already seen a particular ATE from a different game, you can simply bypass these. Some ATEs help progress the plot, while others give the player help with new commands. In all, this is a great game for all playing levels. New and young gamers can set the game up so it gives you time to think during combat, and helps out out with skill setting. Advanced players can tweak all of the details themselves, and immerse themselves in the challenging card games that are part of the plot. There's something in it for everyone!	1
The last installment of the Final Fantasy series on Playstation reached stores nationwide in a very low-key manner. The anticipation and exhilaration that associate with the release of Final Fantasy games have obviously lessened. I uncharacteristically DID NOT pick up the new game on the first day it released. Honestly, I was not too excited about the release of this game due to 3 major reasons: 1) Square's quality of work has been questionable these recent years, 2) relatively short period of time has passed since we have seen FF8, 3) the Final Fantasy series has been evolving so much that I was not sure I would still get the same thrill I got when I played FF IV on SNES. I was not a bit disappointed. Right from the beginning, Square shows again that FF9 is a product of quality. Even though it has only been one year since the release of FF8, this new installment does not show sign of a rushed production. I could not help but notice and appreciate the amount of effort and passion that were infused into the game. I could say with FF9, Square really strengthens my faith in the FF series, wins my heart, and brings me back to the good old days. Graphic is one of the first elements that attracted me. The color scheme is very well used to create a nice blend of the whole composition. I did not like the color scheme in Chrono Cross at all because everything is so bright and sticks out like an eye sore. Background, characters, and environment are very well designed in such way that you find unity and harmony. Needless to say, CGs from Square are always top notch, first rated, state of the art quality. The injunctions of CGs are proper, and served to extend the flow of events; nevertheless, they are wonderful eye candies that I cannot get enough of. Sound, I agree with most critics, still plaques the FF series on the current PSX platform as unsatisfactory. By no measure that the sound is not good, we just think that it could easily be better, given the experience that the composer Nobuo Uematsu possesses, and the quality of music the PSX can perform. I have to say the sound is good enough for me, and I particularly enjoy the polished quality of various sound effects in through out the game. Do not expect any revolution in the gameplay department. Square just delivers what you would have expected from a FF game. I could not see anything special about the battle system other than it is simple. Yes, people will still complain about the random battles. I did enjoy the employment of materia and junction system in the previous 2 games; therefore I hope Square could have incorporated something special to make the battle system a little more interesting. Mini games and side tasks that are scattered throughout the game are both interesting and fun to play with. Overall, the game rocks! It has been a long time since I played a good and quality RPG or game on PSX, I greatly enjoy Final Fantasy 9. The story is nothing spectacular but is delivered and presented very well with nice flow of events and timely unfolding of plots. Bottom line, Final Fantasy 9 is great game that I enjoy playing. Graphic, Presentation and Value outweigh minor imperfection of sound and gameplay. Square has successfully perpetuated the legend of the Final Fantasy series.	1
I thought there was no way that this game could top the excellent Final Fantasy 8, but Squaresoft does it again. Everything about this game is pure dynamite. Great story told with a fast pace and unbelievable movie sequences, fun battle and abilities system, gorgeous music, amazing graphics, and the best cast of characters in any video game ever. Each one comes alive as the story unfolds and each one is extremely likeable. Now I'm running out of good adjectives to describe this game, so just trust me and go buy it.	1
Finally, a Close Combat game that features the invasion of normandy. I snatched this game up so fast, I couldn't wait, and once I got into it I wasn't disappointed. The first thing I noticed is that I can actually pass some of the missions. Close Combat IV was so incredibly difficult it almost made me hesitant to get this latest installment. Thank goodness, the easiest setting really means easy in this one. The game itself really isn't any different than the last couple CC games, and really could be considered an addon if it were any other game. Basically just has new missions, maps and various other minor features. That doesn't mean I don't like it. I love it. The missions involving taking the beach are just a blast, and so is basically everything else. This is definetly the best Close Combat yet.	1
I downloaded this demo from gamespot this morning. I have played non stop trying to master the Americans and the Germans. Great reality engine and awesome graphics. This is the best of the Close Combat series and If you have liked war games or strategy games in the past you need this game. The demo only comes with one mission though but it is a mission that delivers the full power of the game. These are your soldiers each one with a background, each one with a story. The mortal cries of your men deliver a strange adrenaline rush that I had never gotten from any game before. Definitely in my strategy collection. Definitely in my favorites collection.	1
This game is the best military strategy game ever. I had the demo and I must of played the same level 50 times. Then I finally saw it in a store then I bought. A really good buy for you strategy game enthusiasts. Go buy it today.	1
I received Close Combat Invasion Normandy several days ago and I have long anticipated this game. As many of the Amazon. Com reviews state, it is a a fairly complicated piece of software. I've only been playing the battles so far and I haven't tried the campaigns yet (Free time is a precious commodity) but, I am very pleased with the graphics and the battle sounds are excellent. You often hear distant shells and gunfire which gives the player that feeling of imminent danger through the next hedgerow or village. The game is also very versatile and you can play it as a novice or an expert. I don't believe I will master this one overnight!	1
Hopefully most of you are familiar with how the Tycoon games work.  With this game, you are responsible for creating a ski resort but more importantly, a village as well.  Something very vital to this game is knowing that you are going to spend the same amount of time if not more making buildings, paths and villages to keep skiiers happy as you are working on the trails, lifts and terrain on the mountain. Here are some positives and negatives to the game.  First, the negatives.  The software runs a little slow on my computer, and I consider myself to have an average machine (466 pentium II, 32mb RAM).  The detail is just average.  You can zoom in and out which is a very nice feature, but even the closest zoom in won't give you that much detail.  They have something called "building cam" where it gives you a 360 degree shot from a building or lift.  This is a great idea and would be awesome but it ends up being disappointing because it is deathly slow trying to move around and get different views of things.  You move the mouse to look left and it doesn't do it for five seconds, by that time you've already moved your mouse again and... well you can imagine how that goes.  The positives, and why I give it four stars -- the simulation overall is very lifelike for the price.  Skiiers show emotions, wipe-out, and use the facilities that you provide for them.  There are so many buildings and features you can build, including choosing five different mountains to start off with.  There are also three different monetary levels to adjust the level of difficulty of the game.	1
This game is very entertaining with few drawbacks. One of the most enticing features is the price. Very cheap game, but still provides hours of entertainment. It isn't the next RollerCoaster Tycoon, mind you, but it's somewhere up there. The game does take up a lot of computer resources, and mine is jerky, but that doesn't limit the fun very much. The only other thing is that you have to first buy certain buildings to get newer ones, and when you start new levels, it gets boring having to do it over again. Along those lines, if you decide to upgrade a building and you get rid of the old one, you have to buy it again because you can't have newer buildings unless you currently have the older one. Other than these things, I find this game very entertaining with little surprises here and there. I would definetly recommend it.	1
I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the first Pool of Radiance series.  It was the first computer game to bring a great PC version of a popular RPG to fruition.  I also played the Black Isle/Bioware versions of the AD&D series (Baldur's Gate & Icewind Dale) and loved those games.  But this one?  I think my review would be censored if I told you what I thought of this game. First of all, the game crashed on installation!  Blizzard may be the only software company that releases relatively bug-free PC games these days but how can a software company justify a game with bugs in the installation process?!  I've heard that I have it lucky.  Some people have had their operation systems wiped out in the installation process. After getting the game to run, I was unimpressed.  The graphics are decent but it doesn't have the same atmosphere as the other recent Dungeons & Dragons products.  It's a "hack and slash" only game and things such as quests, great storylines and character interaction which made so many of the Dungeons & Dragons games enjoyable are non-existent in this product.  The instruction manual is also a poor substitute for an introduction to the new 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons rules. I'm afraid that the more I play this game, the more technical errors I'm going to find.  There are already many bugs such as the game crashing when you save it during certain conditions.  I can live with a bugged game if it promises to offer great gameplay when it is fixed with patches but this game is a pitiful attempt to live up to some of the great successes the Dungeons and Dragons series has seen with PC games. Don't waste your money.  If you're an avid D&D fan, wait until the game price drops and then try it out but I'd recommend Baldur's Gate II as a much better alternative if anyone desires a great RPG game for the PC.	-1
I pop in the disc and select install. The game refuses to let me do a full installation because it says I don't have 1 gig of space free on D:\(When I clearly have 5 gigs free). So, I have to do minimal install. I then finish installing it and go to play the game, only to learn that it didn't install on D:\ drive. Apparently, I need to download a patch just to install the game to D:\. Wow, the creators sure messed up on something so fundamental. They must not have even tested the game because apparently, you can't install the game in any specified folder unless you download patch 1.1. Then I go to play the game only to see my characters walking at 2 miles an hour. I start it up with a paladin, barbarian, and rogue tearing the place up while my mage sits down and rests. I then realize that my characters don't have their long swords equipped. This is odd because I just equipped those long swords. I look at my inventory only to learn that there is no long sword animation. I have the sword equipped but I can't see it because I guess the creators left that out or the minimal installation(which I was forced to use) must not have it. This pisses me off greatly. I then look around for quicksave. Where is quicksave? I have no clue. You can't customize your controls or something. I then give up on the game to play Icewind Dale. The games have the exact same stories, and Pool of Radiance has so many problems that I don't ever plan to play it again. Besides, if you do find a sword that does 585598250298 damage in the first dungeon, you know theres a problem.	-1
Pool of Radiance shows every sign of being rushed to market despite obvious problems in the user interface and serious bugs. It's only redeeming feature is a turn-based combat system that is deeply flawed and the ability to save at any time which is very important. Let's start with the boring and repetitive dungeons which look like they were expressly designed to antagonize the players. Long detours are required to travel between nearby locations. The automap is almost useless as it consistently shows openings where none exist. ... Frequently characters fail to take anything close to the obvious, direct route to their targets and consequently arrive there too late to take any further action. Often a character would walk through a cloud of death rather than take a shorter, clear route. However, the bad guys were just as stupid so I guess it evens up. The targeting algorithm is equally bad. All the characters are animated (wings flapping, etc) and even when the cursor is stationary they will move in and out of the target zone of an arrow or spell depending on which frame of the animation is being shown. Not only does this cause a problem when trying to target the character, but it causes problems when trying to target nearby characters, too. The angle of view also prevents you from targeting characters when there is a larger character in front (from the viewer's point of view, not the character's point of view)... The non-combat part of the targeting algorithm is also flawed. Quite frequently it was impossible to persuade the group to move to the desired location because of the angle of view (which cannot be changed). There are also artificial restrictions on how far characters can look and travel both in and out of combat. You can arrange your party to travel in a particular formation. This feature doesn't work. I had my fighters up front, thieves and clerics next, and my magic-user at the back. So why is it my magic user always seemed to walk into a room first? I couldn't get my fighters into combat until the bad guys had killed the magic-user because the silly sod was blocking the door. I wish there was a way for my fighters to kill the magic-user first. I lost several turns in each fight because the computer has a habit of ending your turns prematurely. It's also unstable. During about 100 hours of play the system crashed or hung about a dozen times. It also pauses for up to five seconds at a time with annoying regularity. I would expect this from a FPS game, but not an isometric view. Diablo never hung once. All in all, this loses to Diablo in every way except the turn based combat (in theory, anyway) and the ability to save at any time (which I really like). Two thumbs down.	-1
Let this be a lesson to all game companies: Take your time and develop the game fully.  Rushing it out the door to take advantage of the hype results in a bug ridden game that ends up in the budget bin faster than the speed of light.  Do not buy this unless you are prepared to be frustrated and send it back.	-1
This game is the biggest disappointment I've ever seen, and being an avid fan of the Gold Box series, it doubly hurts. Beware at your own risk if you buy this one.  And don't even try if you are running 2000/XP.  According to Ubi Soft, these are "Business" operating systems, and we should not expect to run their games on a business operating system. But I was asking them about XP Home?  Last I checked, that wasn't considered by Micro$oft to be a business operating system. It's this arrogance and negligence by Ubi Soft that will convince me never to buy another game from them again. Anybody want an opened, unused version of POR?	-1
Just about everything they could do wrong...they did wrong.  The interface is absolutely awful. The characters move in this pokey slow manner that make you want to scream.  Getting at spells goes through a multi level menu.  The combat is almost exactly like the old turn based Pool of Radiance from five or six years ago. I take a shot, then you take a shot then he does, etc.  Utterly lame.  The adventure is completely linear.  It gives you no choices and leads you by the nose.  Often you don't even have a choice of right or left since the dungeons tend to lead you in a line as well.  When you level up the machine decides how to allocate your feats and skill points for you.  Please, please, please save your money.  Buying this would only encourage them to put out more garbage.	-1
Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers won't be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right.	1
Very fun game.  I was told to get this game... so yeah.  I like the online multiplayer the best.  Kudos to all UT gamers!!!	1
This is the only game I am willing to rate 5 stars for fun and for overall gameplay. This game is still #1. It has the most exciting gameplay, the single player is still challenging and the online gameplay is alive and well after NINE YEARS!! Nine years later video game makers haven't beaten this game, and nothing beats playing Assault and storming the beaches of Normandy. 5 stars, two thums up.	1
Today, with the arrival of Unreal Tournament 2004, the original seems almost obsolete. However, there is one advantage the original has over its bigger brethren. The system requirements.  A PC required to run UT today would probably run you less than $300. Even at this price range, the system requirements would probably still be over the needed limits. How times change, huh? I know some people who remembers that UT was actually kind of difficult to run at the time of its release (I was only a console gamer at the time, so I didn't know). Imagine years from now when Doom 3's requirements would be considered nothing...  Anyway, as I've said before, the biggest advantage to this is the low requirements. If you have a weak PC, then you could simply opened up UT and get a quick fragging game on. You could play at maximum settings and still get 60fps (for those who don't know, that is EXCELLENT speed). As UT is meant to be a fast pace game, this is extremely important.  Speaking of which, that is probably the main appeal of this game. The ultra fast pace of the game adds tremendously to its gamelength. Supposedly, UT was released as a competitor to Quake II, but I had a chance to play Quake II later and I thought it was horrible compared to UT. Hell, I played Quake III later and thought it was horrible compred to UT. If you've played Quake before, then just take that and give it a few bottles of steroids.  While the pace is comparable to Quake, it is how you play it that makes it so much better. Whereas many of Quake's stages are often confining, UT gives you large stages that lets you roam around with a shaky trigger finger. The stages add tremendously, especially when you play Deathmatch. That reminds me, the game modes are GREAT! While there are many game modes, the two which are the best is probably Deathmatch and Capture the Flag.  Now, the speed and modes are great, but there is more. Online play and maps. There are ALWAYS people fragging online, so you never have to worry about lack of people to play with. This is great for when you have insomnia and want to stay up killing strangers online. Secondly, the downloadable maps are GREAT! Have a map from another game that you want to play? Search for it online and you might find it!  In conclusion, all of the aforementioned parts of UT gives it an extremely high replay value. Highly recommended for people who likes fast pace games and like to have a quick fragging round every once in a while. Not recommended for anyone who is disturb by mass bloodshed, but for those who don't mind it, go ahead and enjoy!	1
There's a point in every good game where, for a moment, something sends tingles down your spine, much like a favorite song on the radio.  In Epic Games' Unreal Tournament, that sight was setting Mars rising on the horizon as I dueled to the death on an orbiting space platform.  Yep, this is awesome. While waltzing through a local department store, I happened upon this game for only ten bucks.  Being more used to games like Descent, I haven't played with too many FPS titles.  Quake and Red Faction were the only major ones I had any experience with, but I had heard nothing but good things about Unreal Tournament.  And for ten bucks, what the hey? All I can say is WOW.  That ten dollars bought a game that I will play and enjoy for years to come.  Simply put, this is one of the highest-quality titles I've seen in a long time.  A fun and addictive FPS, UT redefined my expectations for an FPS game and is easily the greatest "bargain bin" title I've ever bought. Out of the box, you get tons of levels and gameplay modes.  There is a single-player tourney, but you can play against the computer-controlled bots as well.  On-line, expect to see packed servers even to this day, several years after the game released.  UT also comes with an awesome game editor called UnrealEd that is relatively easy to use.  Tutorials are everywhere and new levels are released everyday to freshen up the UT experience.  Put bluntly, this game never gets old.  The graphics aged rather nicely, and the soundtrack is remarkably great. Even when I compare it to Unreal Tournament 2003, which I later bought on account of the greatness of the original, UT still shines.  The awesome weapons, the varied arena settings, and the general "feel" of the game just aren't the same in UT2K3.  There is a certain beauty and elegance to this game, despite the lack of insane details as in UT2K3, that keeps me coming back to it. Critiques?  I only have a few.  One, the netcode is rather sensitive to lag, such that if you aren't playing on a sub 100ms ping server, you might find that its unplayable (course, that's just my opinion).  Two, I wish there were more character models to use.  There are about a half-dozen in the game with only two or three "skins" apiece.  While it's enough to differentiate between players, there is too much repetition to it (UT2K3 addressed this by having tons of models to choose from).  And last, I tend to think that the game's sense of scale is a bit strange.  In many levels, including my own attempts, the players seem small compared to the environments around them.  This is even more prominent in UT2K3.  None of these flaws are major problems, however - more like tiny details and ways to improve what's already near perfect. For merely ten bucks, you can't go wrong.  If you haven't played UT, you owe it to yourself to find and buy it.  Check the bargain software section at your local store.  This could very well be the finest FPS ever designed.	1
This is a game that is fun anytime.  I found the single player game a total blast o rama. It is non stop action.  Ive played so many first person shooters and this game set the standard for sure.  The develpers and producers have since release tons of official extras for this game to double the replay value.  They have added downloadable map packs with new music, character models, voices, and freshness!  Even with all the new fancy games out, I still end up playing this all the time.  My freinds all love it too and that is where the game really shines: mulitplayer.  Take this game online. If you don't have the featured map(there are zillions made by fans) then the game downloads it for you right before you start blasting!  It's fool proof. 100% action 100% fun 100% replayability 100% worth the price I already bought two copies back in the day for full price, which I never do.  It was that good and worth it to buy it again after losing the fisrt copy. Like I said, I never pay full retail for games, but this one was an excellent exception.	1
Unreal Tournament is an awesome first person shooter and not to miss for big fps fans.  This is fps at its heart, to the core.  The whole presetation is excellent from the graphics to the sound.  Many maps and levels to choose from and many different scenarios too.  Lots of classic weapons and body blowing upping.  Online multiply is a blast.  The game installs right to your hard drive so you don't need the disk to play after you've installed it.  The game is only 10 to 15 dollars so why not buy it?  Its a great game with great play mechanics and provides too much fun.	1
Unreal tournament is like unreal, just your one earth participating in a fun and tight tournament, with/against the most violent and skilled warriors in space, wheather you play start mode, and beat all of the tournaments from, capture the flag, to deathmatch, to teamdeathmatch, to domination, to last mand standing! Pratice session lets you configure and pratice unreal tournament sessions to become a unreal MASTER! With improved graphics,sound and overall withing botmatch and multiplayer type game, a more fun and improved one in those catagories, I would recommend this game to unreal fans!	1
UT is probably the most refined and complete First Person Shooter to have ever come out.  It is a complete single player AND multiplayer game.  In my opinion, the game pace/action is just right: not too fast and not too slow, whereas Quake III Arena's pace is blitzkreig-lightning-like-fast; too fast for my tastes.  Graphics and lighting effects are superb as is sound and sound effects.  There are a plethora of weapons and most of them have ALTERNATE methods of firing, which is an added bonus.  The weapons themselves are great looking, very detailed and some of them have digital counters which indicate the amount of ammunition in them.  There are far more maps than in Quake 3 and far more modes of play, making this a much more complete game than Quake 3.  The only flaw of Unreal Tournament that I can think of is that there are a limited amount of skins, and unfortunately, all of them are humanoid/military-like whereas Quake 3 Arena has all types of skins. If you're a fan of Doom-like games and fast paced blow'em away style First Person Shooters, purchase this title and you'll soon discover that in your repertoire of action games, Unreal Tournament is your "piece de resistance."	1
...there. Unreal Tournament itself has amazingly good gameplay, enough to make you sit behind your computer all day and play. There are multiple gameplay modes, like Deathmath, Team Deathmatch, CTF (Capture the flag), Assault, and Domination. Assault is a mode where the assaulting team has to overcome the defending team and reach an objective (one of my favorite maps for this is Overlord, a WWII Normandy beach landing map). In Domination, the competing teams must take over control points and rule the map. If the game itself is not enough, it also offers an easy-to-use editor called UnrealEd, and there's already tons of mods out there (like the acclaimed Tac Ops, which is included on this edition). You don't need a top-of-the-line computer to play this, either. I used to play on a 800ghz computer and it ran just fine in botmaches and low-ping servers. That's another thing: there's TONS of servers out there calling out for you to play on them. Never will you be unable to find a place to play your favorite maps. Buy UT:GOTY right now, it's a steal at the low price amazon.com is giving it at.	1
I'm really sorry if any of the developers of ROMD are reading this, but this game is a dog.  DO NOT buy it.  Go buy one of the Baldur's Gate games instead, or wait for Neverwinter Nights.  I was so disappointed by this game because it could have been so much better.  As the first D&D 3rd Edition game out there, it had the opportunity to define the standard by which others would be judged.  Instead, it failed to qualify as even remotely fun, especially in comparison to the Baldur's Gate games. Plenty of other reviews talk about the numerous inexcusable bugs (like the install/uninstall problems) or the painful game play (why exactly can't I send party members more than one screen away from the leader?), so I won't get into it here.  What I would like to know is: a) how could the people who slaved on this game night and day for god knows how long not realize that the game was fatally un-fun? b) how could these bugs have slipped past QA? So much potential.  So disappointing.	-1
Caveat Emptor Let the buyer beware! Pool of Radiance has been shredded by the masses.  People who don't believe in the death penalty want to kill the people at UBI Soft.  Why?  Well, that is a good question. First off, let me say, this game has some serious issues right out of the box, which, in my belief are the fuel for the fires of irritation which seem to consume most all of the reviewers.  Apparantly, Ubi was in such a hurry to get out this game which has laid dormant for so long, they forgot to do adequate beta testing.  To worsen things, there seems to be some squabble between the producers (Ubi soft) and the developers as to whose fault it is.  Without being privy to that knowledge, the most logical culprit is Ubi soft, since most of the game code was written litteraly years ago.  Besides, one of the quirks was no uninstall program, which is definitely UBI's fault. Anyway the major problems are:  no uninstall, strange problems with corrupted data on the game saves, not enough 3D hardware support, and a crash near the end of the game.  These problems will be addressed by patches, which today 10-23-01, there are two which fix the (1) unistall and the (2) game save corruption.  The third "mega" patch, should fix all the other technical problems folks are whining about, like 3D support mainly, and other errors and bugs. Perhaps, since there are so many bad problems with this first release, they will rerelease the game with all the fixes in there. I hope so. The above bugs are why the game received four stars, and not five. Folks say that PoR has slow battles.  Yes, they are slow.  They are turned based, sort of like playing an RPG with dice, except, they are not THAT slow, and they are not at all boring.  The graphics are fantastic, and the weird stagger of zombies and ghouls and ghasts gives you the creeps--which couldn't happen if they all ran to meet you, or if they just appeared.  The folks that say game play is slow, don't bother to offer any solution as to how a turned based game could have quicker combat.  And, personally, I love combat!  The more time I spend in combat, the more fun I have!  It is tactical turned based combat, like X-Com, which was one of the best games of all time. So, if you think this game is real time, read the box.  It is just turned based.  So, if you hate turned based games, don't buy this game. They say the interface sucks.  Well, I for one, didn't have to read the manual to figure out how to play the game.  That to me says the interface is intuitive, at least for weirdos like me.  If pull down menus annoy you, don't buy this game.  Otherwise, it is pretty much just like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale.  The only difference is they have more stupid icons.  Now, is that really that difficult to use? BTW, I am a Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale fanatic! The third edition rules are much better to me than the second edition, because they are more logical.  They are more difficult to understand in a lot of ways (unless your name is Spock), but they add much more dimension to the game. There are some discrepencies between this game and the actual third edition rules, but that is because the rules weren't solidified when they were making the game.  However, the rules they have are fair, balanced, and very interesting. The dungeons are huge!  There are interesting puzzles, interesting bits of D&D lore, traps galore, undead crawling from the cracks, and even undead orcs and lizardfolk!  I mean, there are some very creative situations you will run into down there that add to the feel of a real dungeon crawl.  The fact that they have a dungeon master really really really adds to the aura of those old days of dice and graph paper for those real RPG'rs out there. I mean, sure all this stuff is trite when you come down to it--that's why they call it lore!  But it is the unexpected creativity you see, the interesting stories, and the fun new character system that I really enjoy.  Sort of being immersed in a whole new world of ahhhhh...... If you have better than a Voodoo 2 card in your system and the most up to date driver, you shouldn't experience many problems theoretically.  I can only speak for myself--I have run it on my home 1.7gHz Dell with a GeFore 2 Ultra and the new WHQL driver from NVIDIA--the game really runs well on that setup.  Make sure you have the latest WHQL driver on your system, since there is no tweaking program for video.  And if you don't understand the above paragraph, I wouldn't buy the game at all.  At least not until they have more 3d support. So in conclusion Don't buy this game if: -your impatient -you don't have a connection to the internet -you have an old computer with poor specs -you like second edition D&D rules only -you like real time games -you hate pull down menus -you are easily annoyed by crashes and bugs Buy this game -you love the new 3rd edition rules -you love huge dungeons -you love great graphics -you have a nice fairly new graphics card with a new driver -you have decent specs on your home system -you want an immersive world with a rich story line -you know how to download a patch and install it -you are patient -you don't care what others think	1
I'm thinking, 'Alright, Pool of Radiance is finally out'. So I pay my 50$ and drive home to install it. I chose Drive D, not C, but it's still on my C dirve? Oh well, let's play. I'm still waiting to play. You can't escape combat. That's a big minus considering the monsters in the first dungeon are way more powerful than your whole party. Why can't I choose what skills and feats for the characters I generate (which are still the only characters in my party)? The customising of characters is nil. I so much prefer Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 even though I only get to create just one character. But those games are way more fun than this game. What's with the movements? My newborn baby moves faster than these guys can walk. Excuse me sir, do you carry any magic items? No. You don't really carry anything. I'll just take my gold and leave. Basically, a big "THIS GAME REALLY STINKS, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, BUY HOOKED ON PHONICS 'CAUSE IT'S PROBABLY WAY MORE FUN THAN THIS RPG (IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?).	-1
Not superb.  Graphically superior than it's predecessor Baldurs Gate, Pool of Radiance lacks the game play that BG held.  I've always said I would take a game that lacks in graphics if it makes up for it in Game Play, and BG did that, This game is mediocre at best.  It is stable on my computer, I have yet to have it crash (knock on wood)so I'll give it point for that, having a game for near two weeks with no crashes is pretty good.  I'll give it a point for graphics, as mentioned earlier they are great.  I'll give it a point for allowing you to create up 4 members of your party.  Where does it lack, Game play as mentioned is poor, interface is tiresome, I guess the hardcore table top player geeks like it, but I can't stand the turn based combat.... I turned it off.  With Baldurs Gate Infinity Engine, it was customizable... players could make their favorite sword from whatever book they read and through it into the game to be bought of found, one group even made a whole new add on for it, but I don't see that this is as customisable, there for not very player friendly, so minus a point.  If you are a BG fan, don't buy it thinking you will get something like it, you won't.  It doesn't hold the interaction of BG, I like that, if I like running around hacking things up with little to no problem solving, I would play Diablo II.  I guess SSI created a concept that had a following already with the original Pool of Radiance game, made a graphically great game so they could hype it up and then threw it at us.	-1
Make no mistake - this is it. The best overall FPS experience to be had, bar none. What's so good about it? 1) Doesn't require much by way of system requirements. If you still have a Voodoo3 with a PII 400 or an K6-2 450, you can play this game, and do it well. 2) More online mods than you shake a modestly sized stick at. Go to Fileplanet, download to your hearts content, and you'll be busy for a very long time. 3) Many modes of game play. Capture the Flag, Assault, Team Deathmatch, Tournament Deathmatch, Last Man Standing, and Domination. I'm partial to CTF myself - Unreal excels in this area. For CTF, no other game comes close to matching Unreal's evenness and tempered play. 4) You can OWN with almost any weapon. Sniper rifles can take off heads even while you're on the run. Rockets, while powerful, are not the end-all weapon like they all in other games. Flak cannons blast flak aroun corners. There's a weapon for almost every situation, and a weapon to thwart THAT weapon as well. 5) A multitude of online servers for every game type. I'm never bored. 6) Completely unexpected modes of gameplay yields the best results. IE - there's a weapon called the "Redeemer". Comparable to a small nuclear device. Kills everything in a 200foot radius. Hard to dodge when one's thrown at you. Imagine playing Capture the Flag with nothing but Redeemers and low gravity? It's a trip, an absolute blast, more fun than a barrel of monkeys. Praise the lord and pass the redeemer. However, players with dial-up need not apply. Your ping will simply be TOO high.	1
PoR has to be the most disappointing CRPG release ever. I played the original gold box games when they were released, and this does not live up to the legacy. There are numerous crash bugs, a tendency for the save files to become corrupted and unusuable (wave goodbye to hours of play), a horrible user interface and the most unbelievably awful gameplay system I've ever had to slog through. I imagine that SSI, before starting development on PoR, had two folders available: one for the best features of the gold box games, one for the worst. The devs picked up the wrong folder before starting. The combat is terrible. It amounts to waiting (slowly, even with gamespeed set to max) for monsters to make their way towards your party and then, just as slowly, attacking them. And SSI brought in the 2-part turn method which was definitely NOT one of the endearing features of the gold box games. It makes for redundant effort and a great deal of wasted time. On the other hand, I *am* getting a good deal of reading done while waiting. People have complained that comparing PoR to the Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale/Planescape:Torment run is unfair. I agree. It's horrendously unfair to take a beta-code "game" which shows little to no knowledge of, to say nothing of love for, the D&D license and compare it to the magnificent efforts of Black Isle Studios' products. It's like setting a flea against Godzilla. PoR is the favoured acronym for this disastrous undertaking. Advance the last letter forward one letter in the alphabet and you'll have a better idea of what this game truly is.	-1
I admit that it isn't as fun as Quake III when it comes to deathmatch, but it's pretty damn close. The graphics are a wee-bit better in Q3A, but Q3A doesn't have much in ways of teamplay modes. If you like working on a team, get this game! If you have a monster PC with a GeForce2 (or 3 for those willing to pay $...), consider also getting Tribes 2. But back to Unreal Tournament, this will last you a while since there's a crap load of levels and modes. I have had G.O.T.Y. Edition for a little while, I just beat Quake 3 with somewhat ease (on Hardcore, heh heh), and I can just say same hasn't gone with Unreal Tournament. IN conclusion, Quake 3 is the best for deathmatch, but Unreal Tourney is best for everything else, from CTF to Assault.	1
Unreal Tournament is a first person shooter, It is single player game with AI bots and great multiplayer game. UT has many types of games. 1. Deathmatch:- In which you must have the highest number of frags (kills). 2. Team deathmatch:- In which you and your team member must have the highest number of frags. 3. Capture the flag:- In which your team must enter the enemy area capture the flag by running through it and them carry it to your area and run trough your flag and then you get one point, You should also defend your flag at the same time, The team that gets the victory point first wins. 4. Assault:- In which your team must attack and defend a certain objective in limited time, Like destroy a certain item or enter a certain area. First your team must complete an objective while the enemy team defends it, Then your team must defend the same objective while the enemy team tries to complete it, If your team is given 5 min and it completed the mission in 3 minuits then the enemy team has only 3 min to do it. 5. Domination:- In which you and your team gets points for controlling the base by capturing the three central points. There would be three central points and running through them would make them your team colour and then you control the base and get points for it, If the enemy team member runs through them it will make them the enemy team colour and they control the base, You should defend that too. The team which reaches the victory point first wins the match. 6. Last man standing:- In which players have limited number of lives. 7. Challenge:- Standard deathmatch game which is enabled after you complete all levels in single player and if you complete it you become the champion. All map have a great training area. UT got a great multiplayer experiance in single player, Initially only a few games and maps are unlocked, But by going to start pratice game you could play all games and maps in the single player level. Unreal Tournament uses the unreal engine but it looks and runs much better here. I play UT on the Direct3D video mode, There is also software rendering, 3dFx, S3 ect, OpenGL is also there but it is not very good. The graphics and sound are fantastic. The selection of weapons are also very good. You can make the game pace slow or fast. You can also include bots in multiplayer matches. There is also an unique game mode called mutator for these games, With that you can play with low gravity, Manage the weapons in the level, Insta grip in which you get killed in one fire (My Favorite). The map design is fantastic, Almost every map is different from the other. UT's bot AI is superb, The bots are very clever, They move fast and play like real gamers, You can reduce the AI of the bots for better gameplay. Remember the easy (novice) bots are very easy and the hardest (godlike) bots are very difficult to fight. The only bad things in UT is the main menu, Epic must have done a better main menu. Unreal Tournament is a superb action game, and surely worthy of your money, A not to be missed if you like action games.	1
This game is soooo great! It runs perfectly on any system, just about, but you'll want either a reliable 56K, or a broadband connection before playing on the internet. If you've got an in-home LAN you're in luck too, cuz you can play against friends virtually lag free! I have absolutely no complaints with this game, none. I usually spot at least one flaw with every game I play, but not this one. It has the most intense, fast-paced, multiplayer mayhem you can get on this planet without risking a limb or two in a real gunfight (which is also illegal, so even if you did get out in one piece you'd be locked away in jail indefinitely). Okay, I have to go back to UT now, can't get enough!	1
Alright, I tried the demo, and couldn't get enough out of just those 4 or 5 levels. This game has TONS of levels and mods, and even more come when you get the update. Although there is not really a story line, it is still REALLY fun. The graphics are amazing, and there is alot of weapon stragagy involved (head shots with a razor blade gun...ever done that in quake?) Online, there are a few thousand servers to quench your killing needs. Have fun!	1
WOW!! This is one of the best 3D shooters I've EVER played!! The blood, the gameplay, the weapons, the music... Almost everything about this games is cool. Aside from the biosludge rifle which sucks, the weapons are really cool. Nothing better than sniping on an unsuspecting attacker in an assault game, or blowing somebody to bits before your very eyes. The graphics are amazing too, even on low/medium detail and resolution settings they still blow you away. The variety of games and levels never ceases, and the variety in skill, tactics and less importantly looks of your opponents always changes. The different games are: Deathmatch - what is says on the tin. Be the first person to get 30 frags, or get the most amount of frags in a set time. The only non-team game. Domination - good although my least favourite. The idea is to take over as many control points as possible and when they are under your control you get points. But so does the enemy... Capture The Flag - surely you know what this is! Get your opponents flag back to yours before they do the same to you. Assault - A more detailed team game that requires more tactics than the others. You have to complete a set of objectives while your opponents try to stop you and after you've done, you stop your opponents from doing the same thing. Each level is different so you'll have to wait and see! Of course, it's not quite as good as the real thing, but if you're like me then you can't afford to be on the internet playing games all the time then this is an essential addition to your collection. Highly recommended.	1
Unreal Tournament is, in my opinion, the 2nd best First Person Shooter game created so far, 1st being Half Life.  There was a lot of hype surrounding this but, unlike Quake 3, it lives up to the hype.  It succedes in all the places Quake 3 fails - fun weapons, interesting boards and a very intelligent AI system on the bots (just try beating the Godlike setting).  And I think it even blows away Quake 3 graphics-wise, too.  My only pet peeve with the game is the load time!!  I have a 733 MHZ computer and it takes FOREVER.  But it's still worth the wait.	1
In the past few years, an annoying trend has emerged in the home computer video game world. Game developers, presumably tortured into submission by their publishers, have been releasing outlandishly buggy games. PoR is another in a long list of casualties. Online role-playing games such as Ultima Online and Everquest were barely functional at release. Black and White crashed constantly. Anarchy Online was a complete joke. Even Max Payne had a couple problems at first (in this case, the patch was out within a couple days). This "release and then patch" method of rushing a game out the door has got to stop. Often the problems aren't fixed for weeks. In the case of PoR, a few people actually had parts of Windows removed due to a bug with the uninstaller. The other problems people have reported are too numerous to list. Add to this some gameplay balance mistakes (or possibly bugs), and you've got an army of angry computer RPG fans flooding the official PoR forums with vitriolic hate letters. The saddest thing, in the end, is that all of these problems are with a game that turns out to not even be that good. It's a notch above mediocre, a somewhat pleasant and totally mindless diversion. There's no real depth, excitement, or role-playing to speak of. Wait for the bargain bin on this one. It'll be there soon.	-1
...have i place such high expectations for a RPG only to receive a game that's barely playable, i got it the first day out but there are now known technical issues with the release of this game. after 2 hours of playing, my saved games were utterly corrupted and the game crashed consistantly back to the desktop. i have to manually delete some files just to be able to play. other technical issues have been raised in various forums that i will not address since i will assume that a workable patch will be available by the time this review is posted; instead i will mention the gameplay itself. graphically, the game looks nice but it only has one resolution of 800x600 so you see a limited view of your party's immediate area. the pathing AI during combat is horrendous, often taking a longer route than necessary... this sometimes leads to your character running by an enemy, giving them an attack of opportunity against you; this can also negate your ability to attack -- depending on how far you need to move to an enemy, you may or may not be able to attack, taking a longer route even though it initially shows an attack icon means a wasted move. it's also hard to position your character to score flanking attacks. the combat manual is almost too cumbersome, though hotkeying commands help. i like the point-buy system of generating your character's ability score which is sanctioned by AD&D rules and a very fair way of managing your needs. but your character starting equiptment sometimes doesn't make sense. your characters generally have a range weapon, a bow or sling, but no ammuno... arrows are really hard to find and was not sold by the first trader you meet (i haven't come across another trader/shopkeeper so far), yet most of the orcs you meet will launch arrows at your party. this game follows 3E rules but pre-determines each character's feats, skills and abilities without input from the player. the characters does not appear balanced, the ranger for instance does NOT have the ability to use dual weapons (no one can) making the class much weaker than other fighter classes; the favored-enemy is pre-selected (at least on level one). getting to level 2 is fairly straight forward but getting from level 2-3 is TEDIOUS -- it feels like most of the enemies encountered rarely provide much experience points. sometimes the enemies seemed harder to fight because your characters are so weak -- at level 2 your will face shadows and wraiths and only one or two of your party will have magical weapons at that point; once you are in combat mode, there is no way to retreat. since you HAVE to keep your party together, you also can't send one character to do advance scouting (this oversight will be a huge disappoint especially if you play the multi-player mode). overall, this feels like an unfinished game that's more of a dungeon crawler (with lower resolution and much less loot) than a true RPG -- the plot line so far is fairly trite. i am just severely disappointed that this game is linked to the excellent gold box series -- maybe it's unfair to make the comparison but if you carry the name Pool of Radiance, you've got to deliver.	-1
I'll keep it short and sweet: Imagine Baldur's Gate I.  Now slow down the action tremendously and make the plotline totally linear.  Then make the game buggy - it often sputters (lags) almost like Ultima Online did back in 1997.  That's essentially what you get with Pool of Radiance. Even with the inevitable release of a patch, the game itself is not compelling.  You walk around slowly until you find a monster.  The monster approaches you slowly.  You slowly attack it and it slowly retaliates.  When it's dead, you walk around some more. If you're looking for a non-linear game that you can play as a single player, I'd consider waiting for NeverWinter Nights.	-1
This game is one of the best games ever made. My favorite feature is the fact that you can create your own characters and build your own teams and melee games. If you have slow internet connection and suffer from lag, then this is the game for you!	1
Unreal Tournament (G.O.T.Y.E.) is by far the best FPS ever created to date. Forget Quake III, forget Half-Life, U.T. rock's! Perhaps the best part about it is the many varied modes, skins, and levels there to play. Assult, Domination, Team deathmatch, and Last Man Standing are among the few great modes put into a video game. Don't think, just buy it!	1
I own Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament.. I like both.. But Unreal is about 10 times better. The single player in UT is actually fun to play. The Multiplayer is FANTASTIC...advised you have a fast connection. The graphics are great and it even runs on older machines. Tons of weapons.... Great game modes.... The bots are very smart and fun to play with. This game is WAY more team oriented than Q3 and actaully involves STRATEGY. Fantastic game..one of my very favorite games....GO BUY IT!!	1
This game has gotten a lot of bad press.  A lot.  I don't even know where to begin describing how much undue criticism Pool of Radiance has received, but I would advise anybody out there not to believe all the hype. Don't get me wrong--this software won't be redefining any genres.  However, aside from a couple of bugs that should be fixed before the week is out, it still manages to solidly provide an experience not dissimilar from that you'd find in the original SSI games. This game isn't for everybody, either.  In particular, there will be a sizeable population of the Baldur's Gate and Diablo crowds that will find the play interminably slow.  That's to be expected--this game isn't targeted at this audience.  What Pool of Radiance DOES provide, however, is a solid dungeon crawl and one of the better attempts at turn-based combat in recent memory. I haven't encountered a single bug in thirty plus hours of playing, so I won't bother commenting on that particular complaint, but I would think that the effects (i.e. "It ate my Windows") some people are using as an excuse to throw around labels like "virus" are mostly fabrications or stories heard from a guy who heard what happened to some other guy.  Generally speaking, if you don't run any programs that will interrupt the install or uninstall process, you'll be fine. So, is the game enjoyable?  Well, that really depends.  If you're looking for a brain-dead exercise in mouse clicking (and keep in mind that I like Diablo, myself) or an expansive story, you're not going to find that here.  However, folks who remember the old gold box games, or people who are just looking for a game that roughly approximates sitting around the table with your friends (as opposed to the console feel that a great many CRPGs are adopting), this is where you want to be.	1
I'll start off by saying, I do enjoy rpgs alot, at least I used to, recently the pickins have been to many and to drab.  This is another example of a game that could have been good, but is too much of a let down. It reminds me of a game I picked up awhile back, forgot the name, but on the back it said it was a 'Diablo like' game.  It was in really big letters, and I was jonesing for Diablo 2 which at the time hadn't been released.  Get it home, and put it in, and its a turn based strategy game....  Yeah, Diablo like my foot. I describe Pool of Radiance: RoMD like this, a very slow Baldur's Gate.  My main problem is that the game plays very slow.  Second, multiplayer seems to be a huge joke, where DOES the multiplayer take up at, and does it have a story at all?  Third...well, the Third Edition rules. This is my first contact with them, and I was really hyped to see them at work, since some friends of mine want to convert some of our all time favorite campaigns over to NeverwinterNights.  After this game, we may skip NeverwinterNights altogether....  To put it lightly...why in the heck is the Mage's spells based off of Charisma, can anyone explain this? All in all, the game is a let down, its nothing more than a really cheap rip off of Baldur's Gate, yet turn based with the characters being so big that you can't see very much of the map at the time.  The upswing is that it is all 'seemless' in the fact that you don't have 'zones' per say, the areas can be very large in scale, so it makes exploring more interesting. Final word, if you like playing with the 3rd edition rules, and can stand very slow game play, then nab it, because all in all, it actually is like sitting down and playing it pen and paper style, taking turns with initiative.  The bugs are pretty bad in spots, but hopefully they will fix them soon.  Beyond those kind of ppl, buy it at your own risk....	-1
This game was really wild.  It definetly shows off what the PS2 can do.  Having about 40-50 characters on the screen at one slaughtering each other is pretty amazing.  Although the only drawback I found from this was I never made it out of the first battle, and I was playing for like a half hour.  I don't know how long the battles are supposed to last, but boy was my thumb tired.  I had racked up almost 500 "KO's" before I finally got beat by one of the bosses on the computer side (and about 30 of his soldiers, where were my troops when I needed them?).  I'd recommend this game, but beware it's not really a strategy game. You run around and kill as many guys as you can, if you get low on life then you pick up what appears to be an onion and you'll gain health back.  You can also pick up upgrades for your armor and weapons (some last 30 seconds, some for the whole battle).  All in all a lot of hack and slash fun!	1
I have been a fan of DW since this game. I am now currently playing DW8. Can't wait for the next one.	1
I got this to complet the sires that I have so fare and still gating the others, best game ever.	1
For a launch PS2 game, I must say that this is a game that excels in many different ways. The gameplay is simplistic and immersing at the same time as you are fighting an entire opposing army at once with enemy soldiers surrounding the player, and you have to be quick and precise about eliminating them or they can deal some real damage to the player, and you have to kill the entire army in levels in a matter of 90 minutes or less, or else its game over; that however adds quite a bit to the challenge factor of this game, but it can be very frustrating to some players as this game is mainly about clearing a massive number of soldiers in a specific time limit. If having a time limit and crowds of soldiers surrounding the player doesn't bother you then I highly recommend this army-smashing classic, as it will keep you on the edge of your seat for 16 levels!	1
The plot of this game is slim.  All that you really do is umm, let me think... Hack and Slash and Hack and Slash.  You run around button-mashing so that you can go to the next level.  Even with all of the button-mashing and Hacking and Slashing, this game is still very fun and I would recommend renting it if not buying it.  The lack of plot is easily made up for by the fun factor of the game.  Who knew that pushing X and O and stuff could be so fun.  This game is definetly a game that I would reccomend to fellow gamers.  The violence in this game is minimal because there is no blood and the bodies disappear.	1
I recently puchesed a PS2 and since then ive been renting all sorts of games, but I have to say that Dynasty warriors 2 is about as good as they come. Its a good mix of stratagy,action,and KOEI even through a little bit of first person shooting in there! Graphics are awsome, although in the heat of battle there is somthimes graphic break up and slowdown. Gameplay is outstanding! Despite what people say,you CAN do tons of moves...There are 2 main attack buttons plus a special attack, an in air attack, and a running attack...Plus you can whip together some wicked combos leaving your enemies stunned or just knocking them 20 feet in the air!   There are plenty of characters to choose form, 9 starting ones and if you put in the right codes (or you can get them legit but i don't know how) you can get almost 30 fighters! Another cool aspect is the jump butten which will come in handy when your army is off pickin strawberries and your surrounded by like 100 enemey fighters. The enemey generals are hard, and you are often faced with the decision to charge in or stay back and fight with your fellow warriors. Much like an RPG,you get stats in this game to. The stats are picked up when a general is killed be it your own or the enemies .But weather you like hacking up dozens of enemies at a time with your weapon, or sniping them off with your bow, or just trampleing them on horseback, other than a few minor flaws (like the repetition) I strongly recomend this game for any1 that is familior with the Romance of the three kingdoms series or just likes to kill stuff. With a difficulty selection, this game is nothing short of a challenge!	1
There is only one bad thing about this game. You will spend several hours playing it and the PS2 doesn't freeze up after 5 hours of continous play like the PS1 did. If you have a significant other who isn't into PS2, this game will cause some relationship problems. The graphics are stunning and the amimation is crisp and rarely slows down. When it does it is beacuse you have 50 guys on the screen fighting at the same time, so it looks like a cool slow motion battle. The story line is the usual Warring States period in China. Does Koei make anything else? Who cares, this game has a perfect blend of strategy and flat out action. The horseback fighting is a cool little bonus. Once you unlock all the generals and can play the battles either way, it really becomes fun. It would be nice if the other soldiers did more, they are usually just standing around but given the sheer size of the battles, it is amazing that they are even there. Whenever I get home to New Orleans I can usually count on at least three days of constant playing dynasty warriors 2 on my little brothers PS2. I can't wait for dynasty warriors 3. If you haven't played this game you are in for a treat. Just make sure to buy some blister cream for your thumbs.	1
If you remember and loved games like Final Fight and Golden Axe, you'll definitely love this game. If you didn't, well, I'm sure you'll find something nice on PS2...eventually. Everyone else, you know the drill. One man versus the horde. You decimate it one man at a time. Only thing is, you've got a horde on your side as well. I haven't seen anything quite as gorgeous as the clash of two large enemy squads in a chaotic melee with archers firing into the mix while you hack, slash, and send fifteen armed men flying twenty feet away from you in all directions. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that on a video game, ever. And don't think this is pure hack and slash. You go through it with that mindset, you'll have to replay levels a whole lot. Strategy is involved. Your army has many fronts on which it fights and it usually fights a losing battle. Typically, the only way to turn the tide is to rush to that front and get medieval on everyone's buttocks. However, if you go and reinforce one front, the others typically fail. Do you press on where you are or rush to that battle front that's become too close to high command? Also, you need to pay attention to messages on screen. A lot of times they'll tell you someone who's intregal to a plan that would turn the battle in your favor and you should do your damnedest to protect him. If you just hack and slash and let that VIP fall, you'll probably lose the battle. Other times they'll just tell you to protect your commander's hide, which you'd better do since his death counts as losing. That said, it's still heavily steeped into hack and slash and fans of Xena-esque rampages won't be disappointed. OK, AI can be extremely dumb. It's not uncommon to watch soldiers stand with their backs turned to you as you pound them to the ground. They also have a tendency to get stuck running back and forth between obstacles. But it's also not uncommon to see rough and tumble brawls between squads as spears and swords swing and bodies fly, especially when you've got opposing officers in the fray. There have been plenty of instances when friendly troops have saved me from an extreme beating. Friendly archer fire will find their marks in the guy beating on you or that lowly spearman next to you will club your opponent from behind, allowing you time to recover. It can get real frustrating from level 3 and on, I must admit. But so far it only gets me mad, makes me curse a whole lot, and want to crush the guy who made me lose. I'm thoroughly addicted. Oh yeah, if you don't like heavy, grungy rock music, you might want to play this on mute. While it seems absurdly out of place for the setting, that being ancient China, it does fit with the setting of liberally dealing out hardcore thrashings on your foes. Personally, it gets me pumped for more.	1
this game will not let you leave the control, in the first day, but you continue playing over and over you will get tired of the same thing: killing enemies with one weapon. If your asking why did i give so many stars to this game, this is my answer: a game with good character, levels, and bad guys. Also you have to fight against almost 1000 bad guys per level, its so hard and cool. But this game has not reach its highest point, i hope dynasty warriors3 could be better than this.	1
The turmoil of Ancient China is reborn! Brandish your weapons of war. Forge a path through enemy lines. One valiant warrior...a thousand fierce enemies.	1
Talk about stress release.  This game showcases some fantastic graphics, and an amazing selection of characters that will keep your eyes glued to the television for hours on end.  Pick one of many great historic chinese warriors and fight your way through thousands of helpless soldiers on your way to completing missions that may lead to the changing of world history.  You gotta play this game just to feel the intensity it brings.  Right now compared to all the other PS2 games out, it's by far one of the best.	1
This was the very first game I purchased for the PS2. It was out of a lack of better options at the store, so I just decided on a whim to pick it up.  When I first put it in the PS2, I was sorely disappointed at the repetitious gameplay and graphics that obviously didn't utilize the power of the PS2. However, after playing it for a while, I soon realized how incredibly fun and addicting it truely was. The strategy involved was just so engrossing, that I couldn't help but love the game. In addition, the historical background they give you on all the characters and battles I found to be really interesting (although I can see some just hating that sort of stuff). It's a unique pace of gameplay, and I think that if more people would give it a chance, it could be massively successful. Oh, and btw- It's not an easy game either. As in all strategy games, be prepared to lose a couple of times before you understand what to do. Although it isn't the best PS2 out there, it certainly is an entertaining one.	1
My personal reasons for loving this game, for those who care- My story starts about 11 years ago, when I accidentally got an old RPG for Christmas called "Destiny of an Emperor", wondering what it was.  I soon found out it was meant for my cousin, but since he asked for it so much, we found there were two copies bought, and I kept my copy just the same.  It played like Final Fantasy I (years before I ever saw a Final Fantasy), but with armies of troops instead of HP.  I learned the names of these heroes over the years of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun...etc, and the lands, such as Chen Du, Shu, and The Han Dynasty.  The game took me over 5 years to beat.  It was a superb game! Then around the time of the PS2 launch, a local store was playing this game as a demo.  "Damn!" I thought to myself, "Look at that simple interface!  Look at those amazing graphics!"  I knew that this game would eventually come into my PS2 library, but I didn't know it had to be soon until a month later when I saw that the character name was "Zhao Yun"!  I knew this character!  He is like an old best friend of mine!  I looked further and found the familiar names of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei.  I got this game for Christmas!  Now I only pray that every time I get a game about "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms" Era (what the era is called), I hope I always receive it on Christmas!  For the record, I used to pronounce Liu Bei as "Loo-ee Bell." Now the game itself- Like I stated earlier, the gameplay is clean and simple, and the graphics are phenomenal!  Nobody will ever have a hard time adjusting to playing the game, or believing it to be real characters or people.  This game can be learned in less than three minutes, and mastered in about another hour, so that then you are a powerhouse of skill and technique!  The story is told in cutscenes before each level, each that psyche you up to fight, but leave you wondering what is going to happen, whether you are going to triumph, or fail due to the enemy's great strategies. While individual units have low AI, the collective of about 5000 troops, all at once combined, must use the PS2 emotion chip to full extent.  You are only forced to sit through 40 seconds of loading before each level, and that is to generate the AI and the textures and polygons of thousands of units.  Sometimes do you get slowdown, but it's incredibly rare, sometimes not for weeks straight of playing; and when it does slow down, it's more like a dramatic slow-motion effect rather than becoming choppy.  This game gives you hours of fun, and never ceases to be cool.  Even the out-of-place music is really cool here!  The worriers dance to it! However, amidst the greatness', there are three major problems that make me give this a review lower than the perfect score. #1-Any side you choose to play will win, and you don't exactly know who won the war in official history, at least not much until you take notes of the dates and forces involved.  #2-The first two levels are easy (except Lu Bu), when suddenly the third level (whichever Kingdom you choose) turns up the difficulty exponentionally.  And #3-It is only five missions per scenario.  I know that it is because there weren't that many actual battles, no more than that really, and being the way it is, it is more non-fictional than long-lasting fun.  At least the replay value is very high! Overall, if you can forgive the game for its shortcomings, then get up right now and buy this game (or buy it here) immediately!  It is one of the funnest and most energetic games I have ever played, and it shows off a good chunk of the PS2's capabilities!  Han Dynasty Forever!	1
I just bought a PS2 only a few weeks ago.  My wish is that if I bought the PS2 last year, I would buy Fantasvision, DOA2, Kessen, Dynasy Warriors2 and much later on, Onimusha and Devil May Cry.  However, that all changed when I actually bought the PS2.  Dynasty Warriors2 was put on the backburner.  AND NOW I WISH I HADN'T!!! This is a great game.  I knew of the history, remembering Romance of the 3 Kingdoms the anime and the video game (I believe it was for PS2, but it was totally different...).  When playing, you barely care for the history other than Yellow Turban Rebellion.  (OK, I admit it.  I didn't even understand the video.) I don't play much in the way of action video games, but I assume this is what it is categorized as.  Hack and slash, definitely.  It is so fun!  I can't pull away from it, thinking about trying to get as far as I can without dying.  Which is a pretty common occurance.  Maybe if I were Darth Maul, I'd stand a better chance. It's hard to choose what character to use.  They all look wonderful and each have their strengths and weaknesses.  Some have speed, some have strength, some are good all around.  You can notice this best when attempting to use Sun Shang Xiang who is very quick.  But it took me forever to take down 6 bad guys.  On the other hand, a musclehead like Dian Wei will take 100 baddies in less than 5 minutes! As far as I can tell, this is not an easy game to beat.  It is easy to learn.  There are four attack features, though you heavily rely the fastest attack and the special attack.  But there is the very special attack that you have to build up.  I tend to use the extra special attack when fighting characters with an actual rank and name.  Sergeants and Captains don't count, we're talking fighting other generals or when you are surrounded by multiple baddies. That brings up another point.  You get horded in this game.  It's not uncommon to get surrounded by 30-some baddies.  Is it possible to beat 'em.  Oh yes it is, 'specially if the rest of the army comes to help out.  Which is rather goofy because most of the other generals like to hang out and let you clear the area. The graphics are wonderful.  Control is pretty good, though I can't tell if my aim is poor when trying to hit or the game is set up that you have to be a little more exact than just hacking and slashing.  Music is...  It's not what you would expect for an ancient Chinese game.  It's not quite heavy metal, but it's like hard rockin' tunes to get you pumped up.  It's the stuff you hear in Sega's Daytona. There are some other goofy things that some people will criticize.  It has been said that PS2 still has 'pop up'.  As in, you can't see the end of the area you are in.  'Misting' is a form that the companies use to hide the fact that the machine can't handle the graphics of showing ALL the land.  (Turok for the N64 did this and it was pretty cool.  Very eerie...)  The places I noticed it the most, the mist was a part of the story.  Also, there tends to be pop in of baddies too.  You can be fighting and knock away 15 baddies, then walk two feet and find another 15 or 20 appearing to take you down.  It's kind of annoying because you are really hoping to break out into the open.  This isn't a big enough negative NOT to like the game nor is it a reason not to buy. The two elements that I find most frustrating are that healing potions and saves don't come often. When they do, they are grouped so close together that you don't need them.  I wish there was a different save option because the campaigns give you 100 minutes to beat it.  (I've gotten the Yellow Turban Rebellion under 45 minutes...)  Healing potions are the same way, they fly off the baddies five in a row...  When you don't need them.  By the time you do, you are so far into the game, you can't turn around and look for the crates or pots that MIGHT have them.  It would be nice to stockpile the healers or at least find the general to heal you. This is an awesome game.  Of the few games that I do have for the PS2, I am impressed with all of them.  Even Fantavision that everyone loves to hate.	1
Even though this a fun game the fun won't last then for more then a weekend.  I usually never like games of this genre but this one brought me in.  You can choose between many characters.  Each has their own unique weapon (including a sword, a spear, two daggers, and a big spiked ball) that can be usen in their own unique special move.  It sometimes can be a little hard to find out where the action is.  This is because the map is a little hard to read.  But once you find the action it is nonstop.  Even though you have a whole army with you, you do most of the fighting and this adds even more action because you are trying to fend off about ten enemies at a time.  The graphics are brilliant.  The enviroments are open and you can lead your army almost anywhere.  There is a lot of tapping the "circle" button in this game and it can get quite repetetive.  I reccomend renting this game for a weekend when you have a friend over so you can kill the bad guys together.	1
I have enjoyed playing this game alot more than I thought I would. The levels are pretty well thought out and each has a story to go along with the battle. There are quite afew different people to choose from which is always a good thing. But only one girl character that I have seen.  The graphics are pretty good and the combat exciting. After long battles though it does start to get very similar. There is not many things that is wrong with this game. A little more in battle rpg events would have been nice. But for all intents and purposes this is a good solid game and much fun to play.	1
I didn't much enjoy this game, though I must admit that the graphics were TERRIFIC!  I suppose this is a great game if you you're into (as the young man at the game shop put it) "Button Mashers". . .  A button masher, it seems, is a game in which the primary goal is to mash the attack button before the enemy hits you over the head with a mallet (or some other unfriendliness). The crux of the game is that you're one of the heros outlined in the opening credits.  Each has a different weapon that they use in a different way from the next (Et cetera, et cetera.  Yadda yadda. . .).  You have to win a series of battles (that are a bit confusing to begin with) and claim various prizes. . .  Now on to how to play the game- (much like the title of this review) "Run around, whack buttons, repeat until you are dead or victorious".  Taa Daa, you've just mastered Dynasty Warriors 2; Congrats.  The only real strategy I've been able to discern from watching 3 people (aside from myself) play the game is "don't get hit". Sorry to have been less than overjoyed with the gameplay, but I've seen really good games and I've seen really bad games (I own 116 PS1 games and 16 PS2 games. . .) and this one is simply too close to marginal to get all hot and bothered about.  Rent it before you buy it.  If you can't stand the idea of returning it to the rental store, buy your own.  (On the up side, I'd give it 2.5 stars if that were an option)	-1
Dynasty Warriors 2 is a blend of weird conflicting elements that work out well! Players take on the role of one of nine initial warriors, and can play as many as 28 in the end when every level is beaten. The gameplay involves you taking control of a Ton of ground troops that must confront a similar sized army of foot soldiers, generals, and their leaders. Your soldiers are programmed with smart AI to fight on their own, but will follow you, once you have initiated a fight, Over all this is a must have PS2 game if you love action and fighting!	1
I don't expect a game to blow me away with story, actors or any other things that goes into a movie. Because it's a game. It's just for fun. With that in mind I try not to rate games too harshly and also because there is usually some reddemming quality that I come away with that is good.  But not this one. The game just starts. No intro, nothing to show what is going on or why. Just straught into a Blood omen clone that ... There isn't any story in the whole game. Just move from place to place and kill things. There is no real reason for it.  There really isn't anything good in this game. It is years dated and uses nothing of the ps2 power. Metro 3d just put this sorry excuse for a game together and then hoped we the gaming community would waste our money on it.  There may not be alot of rpg games on the PS2 but they are coming. Save your cash for the good ones.	-1
Every once in a while you just go ahead and buy a game without knowing anything about it and you are sorry you did.  I have had this happen to me once before with a bad game called Deathtrap Dungeon.  Well I referred to this game as Deathtrap Dungeon 2 because it's another mistake on my part. And believe me, I am not all that hard on games.  I want to like games and I want to have fun, but there isn't much good about this game.  First off, as the other review noted there is no story.  You start the game off right in battle, and you expect the story to pick up after that right?  Wrong.  Think a story is going to show itself at the beginning?  Wrong.  I have yet to see any story.  The only story you will get is from reading the book. The game kind of reminds me of a Diabalo/Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, except both of those games were good, and Dark Angel is not.  If they would have just thrown in some good voice acting like in Legacy of Kain then the game would be so much better, but they didn't. The graphics are definately subpar.  The menu screen looks like something that could have easily been done on the PS1.  Actually, the whole game looks like it could have been on the PS1.  The only part that seems above par is the sounds and music.  But there is only so many times you can hear a monster grunt, or one say "You'll regret that" after you wax him before that gets old. They say this game is an Adventure/RPG.  I don't see much RPG about it.  There really isn't much freedom to wonder around.  Guess my idea of a RPG is Phantasy Star, Summoner or Final Fantasy.  On Dark Angel you point a silver cursor to one of the areas on the map then it shows brown dots go to that location.  There is no getting attacked on your way to anything.  Then all you do is crawl around level after level of some dungeon killing lots of monsters, picking up weapons or stuff, hitting switches, and sometimes killing some monster that gives you some item to fullfill a quest you got from one of the towns.  Then you take the item back to the town and they give you some money.  You also can collect items to take to these shrine things in the towns and they can raise your strength or one of your other attributes. The towns are pretty bad too.  There is very few people in each town, and probably only two of them are of any use to you.  Meaning, there are probably only two of them that you can get a quest from and buy and sell items. I see nothing original or good about the game (besides the sound).  And unless you really like just mind numbing dungeon crawling, then I can't really recommend this game to anyone.  I can see this game coming down in price real quick because once some people get the word out about how bad it is, people probably won't be buying it too much. Please rent this game if you really feel the need to play it.  Then decide whether or not to buy it, I have a feeling that after a few hours of playing it, you won't want to waste your money on it. Believe me, I wanted to like this game.  I really wanted it to be good, but it just isn't.  Please don't make the mistake I did and buy this game because you think it's going to be good, it just isn't.	-1
No story, character, graphics, controls suck. All I can say is that I'm glad I found this at EB Games for only $5. If I read all the negative reviews on here first before I bought it, I still would not have spent $5. That's pretty bad when a game isn't worth that and this is one. I played it for about 15 minutes and I'll never play it again. Don't waste your time on this one.	-1
Tell ya what, all you bored gamers waiting for Fall's lineup to hit the store, pick this one up!  The story line is extensive and intricate!  While the controls may be a little clunky and hard to pick up at first, it's worth it!  As you progress through the story and witness some intense cinemas, you really begin to connect with your lead heorine!  While fighting is the main concept to this outstanding game, alot of emphasis is also put on interacting with other characters, which you pick up througout the game! The best thing the gaming industry could do is to make a sequel to this game IMMEDIATELY!	1
this game is not exactly top notch, hell its lower than bottom notch. i must say that Armorines is just as fun as this game, and thats not good in any humanly possible way... Graphics-6: the graphics ar pretty bad, Anna does random and stupid stuff in the inventory but the backgrounds are done fairly nice. its a 3/4 overhead view so you cant see much detail on anything, but the sheer number of monsters that can appear on-screen at once is amazing. but with a little down scale on monster # appearance and background textures and a little down-tweaking on character smoothness this could have been done on the PS1, and it would have been better. Replay-2: if you have the gut to play through this for an hour or more your a brave man who desreves thousands of dollars and a memorial all to himself. if you can pick up the game, play it for 5 mminutes and see that it wreaks ...then your a human being. if you play through the game once, all the way, your godly. Story-1: what kinda ...game has no story? this one is a good example, you immediately strat off in a fight ina  village, the game will pick up after that right, umm NO!!! if you hate story i suggest getting this game. Control-10: if you can tfigure out the controls you should be shot and dumped in the hoover damn, after that your remains shall be picked clean by seagulls. Fun-3: sometimes of your bored beyond humanly possible reason you might play this for a quick burst of enjoyment while you hack up endless streams of invincible monsters for about 15 minutes before you need to go puke for every minute of gameplay. also you might wanna hit your head so you don't remember ever playing the gme as it will shatter your humanity.	-1
This game is very horrible. I rarely give out one stars but this game so greatly deserves it. GRAPHICS:4/10. Pretty bad but not so horrible that you can't bear to look at it. Back grounds are actually done quite nicely. SOUND:4/10: There are some great scary growls and moans but there is no voice acting and the main character doesn't even talk. REPLAY:10/10. If you had the guts to play this game twice it would be just as boring as the first time ;D CHARACTERS:1/10: What characters? There's the main character and we know nothing about her. STORY:1/10. It's hardly fair  making a rating of the story because there simply is none. CONTROL:9/10. Ok OK  I'll admit there is a good side to this horrible game it's extremely easy controls. CINEMAS:1/10. Huh? What cinemas? There's no story so why would there be movies? Why would there be anything good about this game? OVERALL FUN: 2/10. This game is a crime against god. I recommend this game only if you enjoy games that [are bad].	-1
I thought this game said it had something to do with vampires.  I been fascinated with vampire lore for a long time and love some of the games that follow the old stories.  I guess I was looking for more of a Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain or Soul Reaver slant but guess what no dice.  This game wasn't by any means hard or challenging.  Total waste of what I paid for it in my opinion.  The sound tracks were well done but the storyline left a lot to be desired.  I am a pretty avid gamer and have a good knowledge of a game that deserves to be played or not and this one is almost no worth renting.  There are far better things to do with your time no matter how pitiful your life is trust me.  Skip it Move on and get over it before it consumes you completely.	-1
You are always told this as a child.  Well its normally ment that a good book will have a bad cover.  Well a bad game can have a good cover.  This is one of the first games I got when I got my playstation2 a few months ago.  This and GT3. Well I played it alittle bit and burned myself out on it pretty quick.  How many times can I go to a dungeon for the same item.  Gets pretty boring fast. This was a big Stink Bomb	-1
I would rather play the original Pong or Space Invaders! A great big stinko goes out from me to Metro 3D. Won't be buying anything from these guys.	-1
I'm not going to give you many of my opinions on this game because there's no point. There's no shortage of opinion as far as how this game is. If you want to see how absolutely outstanding this game is, simply look at all the reviews below singing praises about this wondrous game. Let's just say, if you like repetition (I.E. Dark Cloud) times 30,000, you'll love this game.	-1
... do not buy this game.  Don't rent this game, either.  In fact, don't even borrow it from a friend thinking, "Hey, I'm not paying any money and I have a few hours to kill, so what could I lose?"  This is easily one of the worst RPGs I have ever had the misfortune to play.  Ever.  The plot is contrived at best due in part to an absolutely ATROCIOUS translation (which can't settle on how to spell the names of important places/people).  The psuedo-new-age music seems to be interesting for the first five minutes, but the utter lack of variety in the soundtrack had me wanting to claw at my eardrums so I wouldn't have to suffer through it any more.  The battle system is very broken; you could be standing right in front of a monster and still not hit it no matter how much you swing at the fool thing.  The upgrade system you use for your equipment is also fundamentally broken.  You need to repair your weapons and armor every few monsters you kill; more often if you use the special abilities certain items grant you.  And this is VERY expensive.  I was so frustrated because it seemed like by the time I'd killed enough monsters to recoup the cost of the last repairs, it was time to repair again.  The only redeeming feature of this game is the graphics.  Even though they're a little crude by today's standards, they're still nice to look at in some cases.  Also, the character model will change depending on your equipment, so your character could be running around with a pumpkin on her head or a metal pot on his head.  Overall, it's not worth it, though.  I never once thought that I'd get a headache just thinking about playing a game, but that's really how bad I found this game to be.	-1
Evergrace is a boring RPG title which was rushed so it could be a PS2 launch title.  If it wasn't a launch title, no one would have looked at it twice.  Basicaly, they put their ... out as a PS2 game because there was a small selection of 30 games and they thought they'd have a good chance of selling their game.  Bottom Line: Skip.  There is supposidly a Mediocre sequel to this game with a different name.  If you must play an evergrace game, play that.	1
This was one of those RPG's that looked pretty cool to begin with but it is not. I am going to give everything and number out of 10 Graphics 4/10 sound 6/10 gameplay 4/10 value 5/10 There were a few good things about it you can actually see what you equip on your character.  Like a vest or helmet.  The other thing that was pretty cool was that it is real-time fighting, so you could go around your enemy when fighting.  Everything else was mainly bad.  Overall there was not any thing really good about it and nothing really bad about it.	1
Evergrace is a very annoying game. It has horrible graphics. Bad voice acting and you have to have your power bar full to attack. (which is very very annoying) Graphics:2/10. I think they're the worst I have ever seen on the PS2. The people are blocky and fuzzy. Resident evil 3 for the ORIGINAL playstation had better graphics. Even the movie Graphics are lame. Sound:3/10. Horrible voice acting and cheasy music. I expected so much more for the PS2. Control:3/10. You even have a power bar for running! And beileve me. It's just as annoying as it sounds. Pros: uhhhhhhhhhhhh...... Cons: Horrible graphics. Annoying power bars. Bad voice acting. More annoying power bars.	-1
This is one of the most important things for a system. If you don't have one you can't save games. And if you can't save games you'll have to start over from the begining each time! So when your getting your system make sure you get the memory card. It's very important. If you don't, your missing out A LOT!	1
This is exactly what you need for saving those games like Crash Bash,and Spyro:Year of The Dragon,and other great PlayStation games. You should buy it.	1
This was my first Amazon.com purchase - I can't remember exactly when I bought it, but this card still works years and years later.	1
Fast ship,good price.	1
excellent product, product as stated - excellent service! A+	1
Excellent item!	1
The memory card is as described in the description and I can play all my rpg games. I haven't had any problems out of it.	1
I can't even remember how long ago I bought this, but the memory card lasted longer than the play station!	1
It's just a great PS1 8MB memory card. I like that the two stickers it came with to put on top and in front for labeling if you'd like to is a sky blue and a pink color	1
I needed two memory cards for my PS1. I have needed it for all my PS1 games. I have gotten use out of it.	1
As it's expected from a product built by the company which built the playstation console, this memory card serves its purpose flawless.	1
The (Official Sony) PSone memory card is the most reliability of its longer use for PSone games' save data. I've been using the Official Sony Memory card for more than over 5 yrs, & yet, the game saves data are still there. How great this is for PSone lovers ?! :) Hope for the buyers need to choose carefully as the second/third companies making some bootlegs of the similar products. Long live Sony !	1
This product will allow you to save all your original Playstation games, on either an original PSX, PSOne or PS2 console. It works great. No problems with mine. It can't hold very many save files, but - hey - for what it does, it can't be beat. Always buy first party accessories for your systems - whether Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft - as it's the only way you can be assured of the highest quality.  In any event, this is a very reliable product, and if you - like me - love to play older games, this card is a must-have. Like I said, good product, good price.	1
For anyone who has more than three PS1 games, your going to need one of these. Now that PS2 is out, these really aren't in demand as much, since many kids are just jumping on the gaming band wagon with the PS2 and have no PS1 games to speak of. For all us others who have been around since the SNES was a baby (me being 16) it is almost a guarantee you'll need, and probably already own one of these. Obviously this is your only choice, and it does what it promises, it saves your games, and will keep them their, inless you wash it (an infuriating mistake.) Unfortuneately, this is a very inconvienant way to store data, since there are only 15 blocks, and many games can take upward of three blcoks just to save one file. Since these aren't in demand in much these days, they're also very cheap. I own about 50 PS games, and hav the saves spread across about 4 memory cards. I found a great deal at target, that can get you three memory cards, just like this one, for the same price as this one. Another alternative to the space dilemma is getting a super memory card, that can have upward of 100 blocks of saving space for just a bit more cash.	1
You can find one for a good 5 dollars at any local store. Completely avoid this 15 dollar rip-off.	-1
For people who say it won't work with ps2, i recomand u to reread the instructions that come with it. it will work on ps2 to save ps1 games..... problem is this card should have ATLEAST 25 blocks...	1
Having a playstation usually means not having a cartridge also meaning that you can not save your progress straight onto the disc. Now, with the PS1 memory card, games such as FFVII, Grandia and Legend of Dragoon should be a breeze. Pop the card into the memory card slot, and watch, as you can progress in your game and not have to worry about dying. As now you can save and reload games if you make a mistake. If you are a serious RPG fan, then I must truely recommend this to you otherwise you may find yourself in a spot of trouble. Now with the PS2 out, the memory cards for the PS1 should drop in price, making them easier to acquire.	1
These things cost like 15-20 bucks and they only hold 15 games! That is very cheap. If you are ever going to get a memory card for your PSOne, get the colored cheap ones that come in a 3 pack for 10 bucks. Thats what I got and now I can hold 45 games for less the price. Can you believe that? 10 bucks for 45 games or 17 bucks for 15 games? You choose.	-1
I didn't think this was a bad storage system, but it wasn't that great either.  15 blocks is NOT NEARLY ENOUGH to hold all of what you can save.  In fact I have up to 4 memory cards now because I couldn't find a mega memory card in time! When you play games like Madden 1998-2002 and stuff then you NEED more space. Some sports game take up 2-15 spaces of memory on one card!  Are you telling me that your gonna settle for that!?  Think about it for a moment.  If you play some games then its easy, one block. But what about some of the RPGers who may have a favorite boss fight? Or the Action/Adventure gamers who have a favorite level or part of the game? What about the sports gamers who have to save up to the entire memory card? Well, I'm not saying for you to buy this, but I'm not saying leave it alone either.  If you buy this memory card you'll have to buy plenty more where that came from.	1
The only problem is that some games like NFL Blitz take up alot of space, but I haven't lost any information with this one and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is my rug is gray and I tend to lose it to the gods of camoflauge when I take the memory card out.	1
Take Armored Core, give it next gen graphics (for the time) and a whole lot more features and you have Armored Core 2. One of the finest game sequels I remember playing, the game still looks good to this day and plays well. Same techno-themed music, same face-paced mech combat, but fine-tuned with new features such as Overboost and internal temperature gauge regulated by a radiator (weapon damage affects your temperature: a new twist in strategy!). For AC and mech anime fans alike.	1
Though the graphics are dated, the action is so furious you won't notice it.  What makes AC2 stand out is the arena mode, which is missing from Another Age.  And, currently, it's cheaper on the used market than AC3.  You can read any of the other reviews to hear about how it funtions, but my personal opinion is that customizing your Mech/Wanzer/Core/Whatever is the real core of this game.  During Arena, you don't have to pay for ammo or repairs.  In the 30+ missions, you do.  And some ammo is very expensive, so you'd want to use energy weapons rather than solid weapons like bullets, grenades, rockets, missles, etc.  There are biosensors needed for radars at times.  Some heads don't contain those, so you sell a head and buy a head.  There is no penalty for selling, you get the same amount of money as you paid.  So you'll constantly be swapping things out.  I had, and still have, lots of fun with this title.  For $12 used, a great game.  P.s.  My favorite: antenna head, big Z core, grenade gun, dual vertical missles, tank tread legs, and rocket interceptors.  Yeah!	1
If your gonna buy Armored Core, buy this one instead of Armored Core Another Age! This one has the tournument mode Another Age doesnt?!I finished this game, and got bored with Another Age and stopped playing it,after completing 80% of it! Another Age has nothing new from this one exept missions,I hear the new Armored Core will be like Zone of Enders? Thers some plus sides to that but I will miss the  original be talked about.	1
I liked Armored Core.  This game was more of the same, but better.  The improved graphics of the PS2 really come out.  You can see enemies and objects very far away and the detail is excellent.  The weapons and equipment are well described.  The mechs can be customized for speed, firepower, defense, etc. to your taste and playing style.  Of the ten PS2 games I own, this is the best one by far.	1
Armored Core 2 is a fine addition to my PS2 Library.  It offers good graphics and sound, and extremely fun gameplay. You will not be able to just pick up a controller and start playing.  It takes a little bit of time to get used to the controls.  Once you do, you are in a for a fun, Mech experience. The thing I enjoyed most about this game is that I can choose either missions to complete, or 1 on 1 mech battles to earn money to upgrade my mech.  The 1 on 1 battles can be pretty tough.  You will die a lot until you learn how to control your mech quite well.  Once you do, you will still find some of your Mech opponents to be quite challenging. Overall, this game is a winner, and offers a unique, yet fun style of gameplay that can not be found in any other PS2 game.  Mech fans will surely love this.  All others should give this one a try as well. Recommended!!	1
With the release of the ps2 I instantly picked up this game.  Its playability along with the ability to redesign your mech down to the last screw provided me with hours of enjoyment.  It takes a while to get used to the control system and to master the in flight weapons battles that come out of most multiplayer battles.  One definite advantage to this game is the ability to create multiple mechs and save them onto your memory card.  After being saved there you can then go to your friend's house that has a ps2 (yes I know this doesn't happen yet, but it will) and the two of you can pit your mech designs against one another in the arena. I would have to say that this game is a definite must for anyone that is into battle tech, mechwariers, earth siege or any of the other mech based combat games.	1
this game is amazing, graphics and game play both. you start out as a little robot but as you beat people in the arena and in missions you can improve your mech. this is possibly the best PS2 game out so far. And if i were you i would get it fast but you may become addicted if so come to SDog's armoredcore 2 anoymous.	1
I bought this game because I was looking for a non-sports title for my PS2 and wanted something with a little more combat than SSX (excellent game - see reviews). I'm glad I read reviews of it before I bought it! Armored Core 2 is a very good game, but it does have its flaws, and there is a learning curve involved. Some people may not want to take the time to get past the initial phase of the game. The premise is simple - you're on Mars and own a mech, a remote-controlled, armed robot. Mars is controlled by several corporations, each with their own agenda, and they're looking for hired help to help them get what they want. That means you. You provide help by way of accepting missions. From time to time, corporations will contact your advisor with opportunities. You can review the mission, see how much it pays (sometimes you get an advance), and choose to accept or decline. Upon completion of the mission, you'll get whatever portion of the reward you're owed, as well as any bonuses you may have earned, but you have to pay to repair any damage to your mech and you have to pay for ammunition that you've used. You can also earn credits (money) and parts by beating other mechs in head-to-head combat in the Arena. The Arena is a ladder-based challenge system - as you beat each opponent, you move up one rung and receive a correspondingly larger bonus. You don't have to pay for damage or ammunition in the Arena. Here's where the work comes in. At first, you've got a very basic mech. Especially if you're not familiar with mech combat, as I wasn't, you'll get beat in the Arena or fail to complete missions. The expense of failing a mission is usually enough to set you back too far to continue, so you'll want to restart the mission. Easy enough? Think again. The game doesn't lend itself well to this kind of progress (intentionally so, I think). If you want to redo a mission, you have to load a saved game (save after EVERY mission!), accept the mission, and start over again. It's not a quick process. Then again, it can still be done. In Arena mode, you can simply choose to fight the battle again, and can do so over and over until you win, although the losses are kept in your record. As you progress through the missions, you get more offers, your ranking improves (you have a completion percentage based on how far you've gone), and you learn more about Mars, the corporations, and other things that are happening. Eventually, you'll have a well-armed mech and will be more able to do what you want. Corporations will also make more parts available to you, especially if you've been working for them, so don't think you're limited to the weapons, legs, and other parts you see when you start. After each mission and Arena battle, you can take your credits and spend them in the Shop. Here's where Agetec makes up for the missions - you sell parts back for 100% of the purchase price, so you can experiment to your heart's content (well, maybe your wallet's) when you upgrade your mech. However, you can't get everything you want. Your mech has an energy limit and weight limits for the legs and the core, and you can't spend more money than you have. If you're too heavy or can't afford required parts, you can't go into battle. The control scheme is typical for mech games, which means if you were expecting to use the analog sticks for movement, you'll be disappointed. In their defense, this system is more realistic. After all, if your mech has legs, it's not going to be able to spin around very easily! It takes a bit of getting used to (and you need to know that the L3 and R3 buttons are the analog sticks - push in to use), but once you've got the controls down, you'll be ready for battle. You can even use a USB mouse to design your emblem (the logo for your mech), and if you've got skills, you can design a really cool emblem. The gameplay itself is good, although if there are many missiles on the screen, you'll definitely see some slowdown. Aside from that, it's nice once you've become accustomed to the controls, and there's something satisfying about taking out a plane or a chopper with one well-aimed missile. It's not all brute force, though. You'd love to be able to lay waste to a facility, but when you finish the mission and get your bill for the ammo, you'll wish you were a little more conservative. You can play head-to-head against a friend, either in split-screen mode if you've got one PS2, or if you have two PS2s, two TVs, you each have the game, and you have one i. Link cable, you can play on your own systems. There are many different types of mechs you can build, and the missions that you accept, in theory, steer your progress through the game (I've not played more than one game, so I can't verify that). I think the replay value of the game is pretty good, if you're a mech player, and I'm looking forward to going back and replaying some missions. I've had a lot of fun with this game, but I've also had to be patient with it. If you've got the time, and if you like mech combat, this is a good game for you. If you're considering this for a younger person, or if you're new to the mech arena, you may want to look for something else.	1
Dont let the title of this review turn you away from the game. But belive me, it is completely true. I loved AC 1 and PS2 I knew would deliver. It did thankfully. The graphics are smooth and there is absolutely no clipping. No pixels when your up close and only minor slow down in mission levels (this happens very seldom, usually when 10 missles are flying at you with 20 MTs shooting at you, which is only like 2 levels.) AThe game is fun, but only once you break through the begining of the game because I couldn't tell you how many times I got the ... kicked out of me and had to dig myself out of debt. Some of the first couple levels are [very] hard, as are some of the later missions. As the title reads, once you play the 4-5 mission you will hurl your Dual Shock 2 controller through your window and sit there meticulously thinkin of how you can get your self out of a -30k debt. Once you get a chance to build up your mech, this game shines through the darkness. You can create a really personalized mech, changing color, parts, weapons, speed. Everything is customizable. I am now begining to truely enjoy this game because if you have patience you will get to the point of this game which makes this a must have. Piloting your AC through Arena mode is a definite plus to get your mind off of frustrating mission battles. The story even progress fluidly with "Mail" that you get after certain missions or arena battles. The graphics are awesome, story is awesome, and after some broken controllers, gameplay is awesome and definitly warrants this a purchase.	1
Very, VERY complex.  Tons of parts to build with.  Great controls, and awesome, detailed visuals and explosions!	1
Because of what I consider to be a significant flaw, this is a somewhat superficial review of Armored Core2. Armored Core 2 has great graphics and even, nicely designed missions, although it often requires you to repeat completly unnecessary dialogs and setup sequences even for repeat attempts that only serve to waste time. Aside from that though, it has what to me is a major and disqualifying flaw. The PS2 has really great analog controls. Armored Core 2 doesnt use them. They say they use analog control, but they only use the 2 analog sticks as single push buttons. How can you build a cutting edge mech fighter and not bother to incorporate one of the most significant features of the PS2. This would be bad enough on its own, but the manual controls are extremely slow and ponderous. If something is shooting at you from behind, you can pretty well count on the fact that by the time you can get these hulking beasts turned around you are going to be toast or at least severely damaged. They also accelerate and decelerate with equal lack of alacrity. I might add, that the AI mechs that are attacking you actually appear to have higher performance than you can acheive in your own mech. It is a terrible shame that an otherwise really great game is so severely flawed by such inadequate control. The design it yourself mech feature is really excellent, and if it weren't for the truly hobbling nature of the controls, this really would be a 5 star game. You will find my copy for sale online real soon now.	-1
When we got a Playstation 2, the first PS2 game we put into it was Armored Core 2, by Agetec. This game style is definitely one we enjoy a great deal. Unfortunately, it appears they rushed this game out the door a bit too quickly. The game design is really neat. Like most mech games, you start out slowly, getting money to customize your mech as you go. There are 50 'ranked' robots for you to fight your way through, as well as 35 missions to undertake to earn fame and fortune. There are hundreds of parts to choose from to customize your bot. You can also go head-to-head by linking your PS2 to a friend's with the cable. Unfortunately the PS2 doesn't currently support modem play, so someone has to carry the unit to someone else's house to do this. The plots are interesting - with three factions trying to get control of Mars, the missions you choose help influence the fate of these companies.  The customization is almost overwhelming. You can custom-design your own logo with their built in paint program, buy parts for a huge variety of systems on your mech, and then test it out in various arenas against various foes. Why the disappointment, then? The learning curve on this is VERY steep - the screens and layout could have been done much more intuitively. The game also runs extremely slowly. Sounds lock up, visuals will stick on the screen, etc. If you've spent hours and hours (if not weeks and weeks) working on designing the perfect mech, the last thing you want is for system failures to cause you to lose missions and die in battles. A true mech fan might overlook these problems and enjoy the game, but those out to test the true power of their PS2 might want to look at other options.	1
This game has an even better and cooler story than all the final fantasys put together. But not as good as the Diablo games. Just missing by a decimal in a percentage rating. This game is sweet otherwise getting to choose from 7 characters from three calans n' all. You get to use four characters at a time. Three are being controlled by the computer, where you are controlling one that you rotate using the space bar. The game is awsom if you like Revenant (another reccomended game) or Diablo.	1
not a lot of one-year old games that are 10 dollars are really any good.  however Throne of Darkness is obviously an exception. graphics:  my computer is an AMD K6-2 350 MHz with 184 megs of RAM and an integrated graphics chipset that uses 8 mb of my system memory.  if that makes you sick, believe it or not, ToD runs on it, so the system requirements are quite low, thus resulting in some "OK" graphics, but from that overhead view, no one really is paying attention that the Swordsman's arm.  and the 800x600 resolution is only OK. gameplay: gameplay is good after you find the priest and blacksmith.  after you actually understand the system and all of the abbreviations of the item stats, then these guys are pretty cool.  customizing armor and weapons with found items (usually from higher level enemies) is pretty cool and sacrificing old items for spell points lightens your load.  you really gotta keep all of your characters (7 of them) on the same level.  I have a level 25 ninja, and a level 2 wizard.  and the spell system is a bit weird.  my ninja has a level 15 spell that supposedly does i think like 175-200 earth damage but does nothing to some of the "bosses" of the mountain citadel (the last "level" i think)  and also it gets really difficult in the last citadel, and because of my slow computer i keep crapping up in the place, but i can go to other places to level up. Sound: music is pretty good and the japanese yells are a bit funny. overall, buy it!  its ten bucks, and if you don't like it, big deal.  are you going to buy 10 candy bars instead?  you will probably enjoy ToD much more!	1
Throne of Darkness is quite an addictive game.  If you check the reviews it has received you might notice that there hasn't been too much buzz or hype about this game.  This is unfortunate because Throne is really a great game.  I have found myself tied to the monitor early mornings before work trying to move my seven (only four at any given time) samurai warriors towards Tsunaioshi the dark warlord. The graphics are truly beautiful.  Set if feudal Japan the gamer must choose a clan with which he/she will set out on a journey that utilizes a gameplay quite similar to that of Diablo.  There is a slight learning curve to this game, as it can become quite troublesome controlling the different abilities of four warriors at a time, not to mention monitoring their equipment/armor status for repairs.  All in all this does not detract from a challenging and involving gaming experience. ...... is currently offering this gem for a meager [amt] which is a blowout price that should not be looked over.  This game is guaranteed to provide hours of fun and frustration. Enjoy, .....	1
This game merges two of my favorite things on the world: ancient Japan and Computer RPG.  Now that I've played it, I'm forced to wonder why it took so long.  With a market saturated with sword and sorcery type RPG's, one set in ancient Japan seems like a pleasant alternative.  The similarities are obvious enough.  Ninja and Samurai are cool enough to stand on their own along with the Japanese derivatives of all those fantasy staples. One reviewer noted that the demo version doesn't do this game any justice.  I totally agree with that statement.  It was that review which prompted me to give Throne of Darkness a try.  It's unfortunate, but the demo doesn't even scratch the surface, and whether the makers realize it or not, demos influence people to buy games.  It's almost better to have no demo than a poor or insufficient one. Complaints: First, the interface suffers from a lot of the things that Diablo and Diablo 2 suffered from in my opinion.  Supposedly the key creators of this game created the original Diablo, and you can tell.  For the most part, combat can be reduced to a furious, cluttered click-fest devoid of any real tactics during battle.  This is one of the reasons why I never learned to love the Diablo games.  Compared to the Baldur's Gate series and all the Black Isle games, Diablo lacked any real RPG depth.  "Click-click-click", Level up, "click-click-click", boring.  If it weren't for a few saving graces, Throne of Darkness would suffer the same fate, but the devil is in the details, something the creators went to great lengths to improve upon. Second, I like creating my own characters from scratch, and you aren't afforded that opportunity with ToD.  With 7 samurai (an obvious number) to choose from, it's easy to forgive this slight.  Also, statistically, there isn't much to the characters. Leveling up provides some variety amongst the characters, but you can only put points in one of 4 stats, so there isn't much strategy or skill to advancing.  Again, this was another big flaw Diablo had for me.  Compared to the Fallout series and all the D&D based games, there isn't much to the characters themselves. While the major flaws of the game can be compared to Diablo, it's the strengths that make it completely different and a far better game in my opinion.  While the fast pace and constant clicking of Diablo grows boring fast, having 4 samurai in the party at any given time combined with a pretty sophisticated tactical editor provide a lot more variety than you would think.  There are approximately 12-16 pre-generated tactical formations based on different animals: turtle, tiger, scorpion etc.  I find myself toying with them more and more to find that "sweet-spot".  Combine the different formations, with the different combinations of characters and there is a lot more variety at play than at first glance.  You can also manually create your own formations which you do by altering each characters personal stance, which affects aggressiveness, and weapon or magic assignment. One of the cooler aspects of the game is the Daimyo interface.  There are four Daimyo in the game for you to choose from, all of which come from the warring states period just prior to the unification of Japan, but that's where any real historical reality ends.  The Daimyo give orders, resurrect characters, and heal the injured while they wait.  The Daimyo also has a priest and blacksmith working for him which have a multitude of functions. The blacksmith, by far, presents one of the coolest features of the game.  In addition to fixing broken armor and weapons, and the weaker weapons seem to break every 5 minutes, he can also make new weapons, and even customize weapons by combining them with strange objects looted off of creatures.  There's actually more strategy to customizing each weapon to each character than you might think, or at least there's as much as you put into it.  There are items based on the four elements which enhance the items, and then there are items that enhance the enhancements.  You can spend hours finding combinations and can come up with some really cool items. With seven characters to choose from at any one time, over a dozen fully customizable formations, and possibly hundreds of weapons to create, combined with all that fast-action combat (the only good thing to come from Diablo) this is already a game worth playing, but it's the whole "Japan" angle that keeps me involved.  I guess if you don't find ancient Japan and things like Samurai and Ninja interesting, or have never seen a Kurasawa flick in your life, you might not be attracted to this game.  If you have, it's probably the biggest reason to buy it.  The game stands on its own as a premier dungeon-crawler (sorry, there isn't much RPG involved here), but replacing knights with Samurai, thieves with Ninja, and swords with Katana (ok, technically they're the same thing if you've never actually held one) is what makes the game such a blast to play.	1
Actually, I never play Diablo II. But I viewed the developer's preview video. They sounded like studying the Diablo's very well. However, the manual did not describe how to use those items to upgrade samurai's weapons/armors that the samurais pickup after killing. I just tried around. The graphics are pretty detailed and I like the audio as well. It is almost like AOL 2 that I loved it so much. It is worth of your money and time, even your sleeping time.	1
There are a few games out there that can stand the test of time and replayability.  This is one of them.  The HoMM franchise has been around for some time, and fans and non-fans alike of the normally dry turn-based strategy genre have discovered that this game is a lot of fun.  Whether you're looking for a quick game, or one that will last hours, HoMM3 Complete can and will satisfy your needs.  Bottom line, this is a wonderful game. For those not familiar with the franchise I'll elaborate.  You take control of one or more heroes within the game.  Each hero has a class (wizard, paladin, etc.) which corresponds with a specific type of town and commands an army of creatures.  Both the towns and the creatures you command go through a wide array of upgrades, and your hero/heroine can discover relics which can improve him/her as well.  In a turn-based format you strive to  conquer random monsters as you explore the expansive maps, as well as your foes who at the same time are building and fighting as you are.  Single player includes quick play based upon your settings, and mission based scenarios as well.  Game include multiplayer play as well. So capture those enemy towns, discover the ultimate artifact, and command an army of titans and dragons!  This game is easy to learn, and quick to pick up and/or put down.  It's replayability is very high, and it's one title that will be on your system for a long time.	1
In a way I find it amazing that new copies of this game are still being sold. In another sense, I don't, because this was one great strategy game, and many years after its initial release I still occasionally play it.  Of course the Heroes of Might and Magic series is a fantasy based war game. Players can choose from various types of castles, each with its own unique creature mix. Its a standard find resources and build up your cities with them, then build the largest armies you can. Heroes are individualized with four characteristics (Attack, Defense, Knowledge, and Spell Power) and can find or purchase magic items which may benefit them anywhere from slightly to immensely.  The game is challenging at the higher difficulty levels, as the computer opponents WILL out build you both in city buildings and armies, and quite quickly. You have to really learn how to manipulate magic and move around the map quickly in order to offset that built in advantage for your AI opponents.  The game shipped with a scenario editor, which I used to fine tune my favorite scenarios ... not to make them any easier, but to more closely match my play style so that they were more enjoyable ... such as switching out a starting castle of a fixed type for my favorite, or starting a hero out with a certain magic item instead of having to restart the game a few times to bypass useless selections foisted upon me.  The strategy in this game is pure, and the various creature groups are for the most part very well balanced against each other. I always favor the elves/dwarves, the knights, or the elemental castles ... all because of their excellent ranged units. My basic combat tactic is to slow the entire opposing army and pick them off from afar while resurrecting my troops as needed. This works particularly well with the knights castle type, as it builds two ranged units and both are resurrect-able. Add Town Portal and Dimension Door to your main hero at some point, and you are good to go. The best way to do that is to conquer a wizard's castle somewhere and build its magic tower up to level 5 with two level 5 spells.  All in all, still one great game. The only drawback is that this was in the era of having to insert a play disk for the game to operate ... always more of a nuisance for the legitimate customer than for the prospective pirate ... they're just going to find CD cracks anyway.	1
HoMM 3 complete is worth getting if you enjoy spending hours using a simple economy building engine/and simple army building engine with a turn based battle engine. HoMM3 puts all these together in a very  appealing way. This is not a difficult game- and it includes many different campaigns - and single game maps. This game would be great for a young  beginner strategy gamer and still alot of fun for a veteran.	1
I haven't played this game in a while, but it is great.  Does the 95/98 version from 3DO work on XP as well as the XP version from Ubisoft?  [...] price difference, so just wondering.  Thanks.	1
i like this game better than Heroes4- i guess because i started playing it years ago and just like this 'original' like gameplay.  i think this game is one of those 'must haves' that you will always come back to and play over time- i have single player games saved from 3 years ago.any well-rounded game collection should have this title in it.  i'm 32 and still have a friend over for a hot seat game once in awhile.	1
Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is one of my favorite games.  There's enough variety in it to keep you busy for hours, and no two scenarios happen the same way twice.  The Heroes of Might and Magic 3 Complete gives you even more things to do. I'd never played either expansion pack; so getting them included in with the original game was nice. I'd played most of the original scenarios to death, and the expansion packs have given me a lot more to play around with. Plus, the addition of a conflux makes even the original scenarios more interesting. There are only two things I could consider a possible drawback for the game: the first time you install it and run it, you have to go through the introduction.  That's nice the first time, but if you have to re-install it more than a few times, the introduction gets old. My other complaint is the starting single campaign scenario isn't one of the easier ones, which can make it hard to get used to the first time around. Heroes 3 is a good game, appropriate for a variety of ages. The minor drawbacks don't take away from the game at all, and it's fairly intuitive, so you can figure things out without the need of a bunch of books.	1
I think my title says it all.  This game is the ultimate fantasy strategy game ever created.  I have played HMM and HMM2, but this by far is the best.  The sheer amount of options in the game makes it all worthwhile, and the depth is just great.  The challenge is awesome, and I love the map creator.  All in all, a great game.	1
There are a number of ways to look at "Heroes III: Complete". Are you new to the series? Do you have HoMM II? Do you have HoMM III? If you've never played an HoMM game: this is a "turn-based" strategy game where your heroes (and their armies) travel the world, securing resources which allow you to buy more heroes and bigger and better armies.  (After you take your turn, your opponents take theirs.)  As your heroes successfully marshall their forces, they gain experience, which makes your troops more powerful in battle (might) and allows your hero to cast more spells (magic). You capture cities for gold and troops. Each type of city has its own set of monsters that can be generated by building the appropriate structures--but this all costs gold and resources, which your heroes will have to secure for you. Battle takes place on a grid reminiscient of a chess-board, and each of your troops (which appear as single graphical images for each troop type) has particular elements which make certain tactical decisions critical. (A flying troop is not hindered by castle walls, for example. A missile troop doesn't need to get close to an enemy to hit it. Etc.) In this installment, you can follow particular heroes along certain campaigns by playing out scenarios, which will require you to be victorious in securing a certain size army, a certain amount of resources, or just wiping out your enemies. It's a game that requires considerable thought and strategy, and is the most complex in the series.  For a simpler start, I would recommend the 1995 game "Heroes of Might and Magic", which has fewer troops, fewer decisions to make, but which defined the HoMM style of play. (You can find this game on the Ultimate Strategy Archives here at Amazon.com.) If you've played earlier versions of HoMM (which goes back to the early '90s game "King's Bounty"), this latest version shouldn't be missed: It has more of everything.  More spells, more structures, more artifacts, etc. etc. etc. If you've played HoMM III and are wondering whether "Complete" is worth it, I'd say, yes, definitely (unless of course you didn't like HoMM III in the first place!).  The two add-ons add some very cool new specialties, one (so-so) town, and a number of variations that will keep you entertained through the new campaigns and scenarios. Unlike most game series, the emergence of each new HoMM game has not made the previous version obsolete.  HoMM I has a different feel and flavor than HoMM II which is different from HoMM III. It is said that HoMM IV will actually have fewer troops, emphasizing the differences between them, and a rather different style of play, meaning that HoMM III will probably stay parked on my hard drive alongside both its ancestors =and= its descendents for quite some time.	1
I was hoping for a Mechwarrior game with all the bells and whistles. I thought it was going to be a major step forward. And from all the pictures I saw this even fed my hunger more. But now that I have it, my first thoughts were, this is it. The graphics have been improved a bit, and the motion is a little clearer. But this is not a much of an improvement over Mechwarrior 3. Its basically just a revision, you could even call it version 3.5 :) For anyone who hasn't played a previous Mechwarrior game, I'm sure they'll love it. I was just hoping for so much more, and I just think that this game was rushed to get released before Christmas.	1
Gone are the days when players stock up on one weapon type, and lay the smackdown on others by simply shooting a few times. Now, you actually have to THINK. Use superior tactics to win a battle, not necessarily superior weapons. An extremely intuitive Mech Lab allows you to customize your 40-foot 'Mech with almost any combonation of Ballistic, laser, missle, and other weapon types. Couple that with beautiful, smooth, realistic graphics and extraordinarily accurate physics, and what do you get? Ladies and gentlemen- I give you *du du daaaah* MechWarrior 4: Vengeance. This game really deserves the 5-star rating I've given it. Kudos to Microsoft for making such a deep and engrosing tactical simulation. Ryoken.	1
The short: Great gameplay, great engine, excellent interface, awful story and acting. A fine addition to the Mech series of games. A solid, stable, fun game that doesn't require that you played any of the previous three to have a complete blast with it. The long: I respectfully disagree with the review that gave this title one star because you can't make any Mech into a supermachine. That is precisely what makes this game better than all the ones that came before it. I have played ALL of the MW games, including the Virtual World cockpit sims, and this is the best yet. The game has been totally changed (and by the FASA guys themselves) from being just a computerized version of the paper game into a solid computer game that more accurately conveys what it should be like to be in one of these machines. The shortcoming of the previous games was that Mech models didn't matter. You could take any one of them and put in any weapons, any equipment, any armor. You were limited only by total weight, so what was the difference? Now there IS a difference. The missile racks on a Mech now really do have missiles in them (or nothing), and you can really hit those racks and blow them up. In the prior games you could hit a Mech in the waist and it would count as a "torso side" hit, regardless of what the structure of the machine was supposed to be. Now it plays far more like you'd think the real deal should. Two 75-ton Mechs are now completely different if they're different models, and you can play them with different tactics. You can use your knowledge of their structures to hit them where it hurts. Shouldn't it have been this way all along? Game balance is totally different: Legs are way tougher to hit and to damage, so you can't cheap out as easily with leg or even head shots. Mechs accelerate, decelerate, and reverse faster, so if you crash into somebody, you don't ballroom dance with them at close range until somebody dies (and the meltdown from a death at close range is now greatly to be avoided--very cool); you can break off easily and continue to run and gun. Every Mech battle is now the extended duel it should be--no easy way out, and no cheap argument-ending superweapons like the Ultra AC/20. Now you've got to actually fight. If you don't like solid tactical fighting, then go play any first-person shooter, ninnies. Weapon select and grouping is now totally different; the HUD is much simpler and more effective to use, and the Mech lab is equally simplified and effective. Wingman command is perhaps the best such game interface yet invented; very quick and it works. Missile play also is done right this time; long-range missiles launch in an arc to the target, short-ranges are dumbfire and Streaks always hit without needing a lock. Other toys like AMS and BAP really work now, and have a noticeable effect and advantage during play. The new way that the missiles launch in a ripple-shower (instead of all at once) is more fun. This means that evasive action works. Now rather than either getting hit with the full load or totally missed, you can do things like dodge some and try to let AMS handle some, and everything in between. It also means that you need skill and strategy as a missile marksman, which wasn't really the case before. The Mechs themselves have never looked better. They're highly detailed, distinctively blacken on damage, limp, stagger, run, walk, recoil, fall, and DIE awesomely. The graphics look great. Weapon effects are intense and the sounds are rich and throaty. You feel like you're dealing out some hurting even if you're only scratching paint when you unleash a machine gun. The AI is no longer dirt-stupid, puts up a great fight and won't sit there while you snipe from long range or pull other tricks that used to work. It's much more equivalent to the great bot AI that you see in first-person shooters like Unreal Tournament or Quake. The single-player campaign is 25 full missions, far longer in play time than MW3. Unfortunately the story is as awful as most other computer games. Starcraft or Half-Life this is not. I can't remember seeing worse acting since high school, so I can't give this five stars. It's solid in just about every other way, though. I look forward to any expansions that may be on the way.	1
It is old and my dad gave it to me 4 years ago.  Many people like it.  It is online and offline.  It is a action and defense game so if you like action and defense then I suggest you try it.  I like it because of all of the good graphics and because of all of the action that goes on during the game play.  I also like it because when I'm offline it isn't challenging for me, so I play it online, and it's more of a challenge because it is a real person.  The game is mostly about customizing a Mech how you want it to be.  A Mech is kind of like a robot.  You can fight and gain allies.  Also I personally think campaign is one of the best options on the game.  I've played the Mechwarrior games other than number four and I also personally think number four is the best.  It's the best because it is a lot more realistic and there is more controls and there is a much better story line.  A tip I have for you is if you are going to do campaign there will be story line videos.  The tip is that you shouldn't skip the videos because it gives you tactics and enemies weaknesses. Again i suggest you try it.	1
super FPS game with lots of weapons. Hardcore gamers won't be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are good, story-line is so-so (and not to short) , audio is excellent and the price is right.	1
Mech games are fun, And gret way to spend on a rainy day. Really enjoy useing the mech lab to build a mech to my spec's. Nothing beats hoppin into a mech and blasting your opponent to peices. Options on how you want to play the game are outstanding from programing the game controler, to options on how want your game veiw. Being able to choice unlimited ammo, and being invunerable,makes it more enjoyable while you are learnig the game. After all no one likes to die alot in any game. Recommend this game to anyone who likes to shoot the bad guys, and of course have some fun doing it. lol	1
Okay, so they did take out most of the old, cool mechs like maurauder and warhammer, and, my favorite, kodiak, but its got better graphics and more weapons like the bombast laser, i love it its great (i can't play it online though...damn internet)	1
I had a lot of fun with this game.  While I'm not really into first-person shooters, this one actually delivered some great gameplay in a very unique gaming world.  The game does have a few minor games; however, overall it's easily worth the price.  Gameplay: You pilot huge robots armed to the teeth and kill other robots similarly armed.  Period.  There is a story line with the single-player campaign, but it's quite forgettable.  The real fun lies in customizing your mech in the mechlab and getting to battle. There are 25 missions in the campaign, and overall they are quite good.  Some of the missions are rather easy and you can finish them in a few minutes.  Others are very hard and will take several re-tries (and an occasional lowering of the difficulty level for those of us who are not experts at Mechwarrior games).  The interface is pretty clean and useful, and I was able to navigate just fine with my old Microsoft Sidewinder gamepad.  Unfortunately, this games does suffer from the same minor, but irritating, problems of past games in the series.  For example, the mission briefings can still be vague and long-winded, and sometimes you'll have to play out a mission 1 or 2 times unsuccessfully just to figure out what you're supposed to do.  Also, you can't save in the middle of a mission.  This wouldn't be a problem if the missions were fairly short, but many of them are not.  Finally, AI opponents fight well and use good tactics, but AI allies (lancemates) can have some pathfinding issues.  Graphics: The game looks very good, even today.  The mechs have good detail, and the weapon effects are great.  Even the terrains are nice to look at.  Footage of human actors are used for mission briefings, and the introductory movie is Hollywood quality.  Some of the environments are destructible, but not in a major way.  Sounds: The developers outdid themselves here.  The sound effects are superb and very appropriate.  Also, the soundtrack for the game is worth buying separately. Voice acting is good, but sometimes a little cheesy and over the top.  Overall, the game's sounds are done well.  Techical matters: With the patch, the game was very stable on my computer.  It came with a very useful instruction manual as well.  Overall, the single-player campaign lasted me about 20-25 hours.  I don't think the campaign has much replay appeal, but thankfully you can do player vs. computer skirmishes under various conditions and play against other people online.  Overall, Mechwarrior 4: Vengeance is a very good game, and perhaps the best one in the series.  It's fairly easy to learn and is well put together.  I recommend it to anyone into sci-fi gaming or shooters.	1
Warning: This program, like many other recent games (form Microsoft and others), will ONLY run on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000. That means that in most common home settings, school settings, or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game. If you have configured your home PC, for example, so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them "limited" accounts (a recommended "best practice" you should certainly be following), your kids will not be able to play this game. Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to "user-level" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game. Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Mech Warrior 4 is a fun game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation. ...	-1
This game was not very well thought out.  Other than the talking characters, the game play feels really cheap.  Feels more like a PS1 game than PS2.  King's Field II is way, way better... so was the first one.  I was expecting this game to be like King's Field since it was made by the same company.  Other than the first person view/feel, attacking, and picking up items, it is nothing like it.  The music is cheap, alot of the rooms look the same, there is no map, and the gameplay is too fast and rushed.  I'm in a poison area where you have to keep activating your Protect Ring to keep yourself safe.  I'm trying to fight monsters and whatnot.  Having to constantly use this item and waste magic doing it instead of being able to use your other rings is a pain.  The game was not very fun to play to begin with, so I don't know why they threw in that poison area.  Don't get me wrong, the game isn't the worst I've played, but it's definitely not what I expected or even remotely close to it.	-1
When you think Unreal Tournament you should think of a PC and not a console system.  While FPS games have a chance on the console, just think about 007 for the N64, it's difficult to make a winner on the console experience.  Unfortunately, UT does not make it into winner mode. Play control isn't bad.  There are a fixed number of pre-set ways you can configure the controller, and not everyone will find one that's acceptable.  I prefer setting J which makes it almost identical Oni style controls and seems to me to be the emerging standard control for first-person games. The multiplayer mode has too many problems to make this game enough fun.  The levels are all pretty small and pretty simple.  There's no network play (though you can hook two PS2s together with an i-Link for 8 player fun), so you'll pretty much max out at 4 people on a split screen forced to use the controllers. If you're looking for a good multi-player FPS, I'd save your money.  It's only a matter of time before some company makes one.  It takes a little patience.	-1
Terrible terrible terrible... very very dissapointed with sony. I actually bought this game for ps2 even tho i had it for the pc. The graphics r terrible, the controls r demented, and it is no fun without playing it with atleast 10 people in the same map with people all over the world, which is a very lacking point of this game.. don't waste your money and time buying this game... get it for the computer... it is cheaper than this one, it's still played, and is a great game... the pc game is a classic, the ps2 one is no more worth a pecan's droppings.	-1
Unreal Tournament may have done well on the PC, but for PS2, it seems dull and uninteresting. Although you can confiugure the controls to slightly resemble any other PS FPS game, they do not have the configuribility (I think I just made that word up)  that Timesplitters has, and with my backwards lefthandedness (now I am pretty sure you won't find that one in the dictionary) controller configurability is an esential. Once you get used to what the controls do, you still have to deal with the speed of the game.  I know that it is more realistic to have people die when you shoot them, but one shot virtually decimating your health just means that you are going to spend half of the game trying to get weapons because someone shot you in the face when you were looking for a weapon, because you died when you were looking for weapons.  Sound a bit repetitive?  Well, this game is repetitive. Another feature this game is missing, that I much enjoy is the ability to choose bots, not just four or five different skill levels, but really being able to pick who they are, and their individual skill levels. If you are unlike me, and don't happen to mind a limited control over your game, maybe you will like this game, but may I also point out that several of the positive reviews for this game are for the PC version.  Something is apparently lacking from the PS2 version, and since I have never played the PC version, I am unable to tell you what the certain something is.	-1
I bought UT for the PC and played that game to death. When I bought my PS2, since I like FPS, I decided to rent Unreal Tournament for the PS2. Let me say this: whenever PC games move over to consoles, they fail 99% of the time, and this is no exception. The graphics are horrendous for a PS2 game, unlike the PC version, these graphics seem muddy and unclear. The other falling points of this game are the lack of levels and characters, and no on-line play is the final nail in the coffin. Buy Timesplitters or the PC Unreal, save yourself from this turkey.	-1
compared to it's PC brethren, this title is sorely lacking. No online play = no fun without multi-tap and 3 extra dual shock 2's... Ugly graphics compared to PC, or even fellow PS2 First Person Shooter: TimeSplitters. Slowdown.  Lots of it.  Especially in multiplayer.  Do not play with more than one other person or you will experience some serious slowdown.  It's not so bad that you CANNOT play it, but it is very frustrating considering how powerful PS2 is!  You shouldn't have to put up with slowdown with this kind of machine.  If you've played Perfect Dark, the slowdown is comparable to that game in 4 player mode. Horrendous controls.  The game gives me a migraine every time I play it because for some reason the controls aren't fully customizable....	-1
As far as I am concerned, this game is disappointingly boring and  just the same Playstation1 game all over again, where is the gameplay. If I may suggest: DON'T BUY THIS GAME Buy Ready 2 Rumble round 2, Its better and more realistic.	-1
I'm glad my first Dead Or Alive was part 4 because playing this first I'd be sure to say the series is doomed. Bad voice acting kills the experience. Glad I could switch it to Japanese in the PS version and here I prefer ENGLISH voice acting!!	-1
I'm primarily a 2-D fighting fan that decided to try this for cheap.  I put it in for 3 season plays & just didn't like it.  Maybe I'll get around to it again someday & reviese my review but for now I've got a NeoGeo Battle Colliseum tourney to finish & King of Fighters 11 lined up after that so it's not a priority at all.	-1
This game, in one word, is "bad." It just doesn't have enough going for it to get over 2 stars. It is a button smasher, and should NOT appeal to any real gamers who have any respect for [their] skills. If you have no skills and can't DO anything besides button mashing, I recommend this game to you, you loser with no reaction time and no idea how to play a game. But here: I'll explain the generous 2 stars I've given this game - it's beautful. The graphics are beautiful, and so are some of the characters *g*, but that doesn't (and never should!) make up for the awful gameplay. Firstoff, there's the awful slow control characteristic of fighting games. Then there's the button mashing. Being a gamer who relies on speed, I brought me fast moves and strategy to bear on my younger sister - and I was demolished for it!! She literally set her controller on the ground and began to smack it, and she beat my arse! My recommendation is against this game, no matter how sexy the girls and how good the graphics!	-1
Just bought my second Telecaster and had to do that, so the wife would give me the keys to drive it. She took over the first one and now is a guitar monster. So we really enjoy this guitar VS the original black and white RB controller which by comparison, well really, there is no comparison.  **This is an edit of the original review and you will now see why.**  The second guitar arrived and was DOA it would not connect. Called the mfg folks, "Oh, yes we will take care of that right away." Sending new guitar, picking up old guitar. Just give us your credit card number in case you do not send the old one back...... It has now been one month, to the day, since the pickup was promised in writing; and the UPS tracking number was emailed to me. Great! Right? Except for one little, minor fact; the guitar has never been delivered to UPS for shipment, by the tracking data, and I still have a DOA piece of plastic. There is no service, NONE at all, on these guitars... SO BEWARE!!!!!!	-1
I was really looking forward trying out the Telecaster replica. The image looks good but the distressed look isn't very realistic when you see it in person. I have no problems with the whammy bar or strum bar. My big (huge) gripe is with the buttons.  The buttons don't occupy the full width of the neck They're about 2/3ds of the width. What that means for me is that I often miss hitting a button  because I'm pushing the button on the side nearest to me.  The shape of the button is also a problem. It's squared of rather than rounded (like the Rockband 2 wireless guitar) so if you try to slide a finger from one fret button to another it can catch on the edge of a button.  I've been playing Rockband since it came out on XBOX 360 and also Rockband 2 and the Beatles edition. I'm decent and I can play most songs on Hard with no problem and some in Expert. I'm sure that I could figure out how to make use of this controller if I had to but I don't see the point. It really takes away from the fun of the game to have to adapt the way I play.	-1
When I received my remote it didn't work at all.	-1
Bad quality controller didn't work	-1
Almost wanna return this. Analog stick gets stuck repeatedly every so often. Keeps movements going in the upward directions. Really annoying. There are several slicings in the core too. Works. Therefore I give it a 2	-1
Remote stopped working after 2 days. the buttons kept getting stuck. "Very good condition"? Nope. it's not in very good condition.	-1
The controller did not function, my system didn't recognize it at all.  Returned for a full refund.	-1
was described as being in "very good" condition.  It is "acceptable" at best.  At "very good" I would expect it to be in perfect working order with mild cosmetic damage at most...  Well it appears to work, but the right stick is practically useless.  The spring or whatever is used to make it go back to the neutral point is dead.  Not only that, it's as if someone spilled the worlds stickiest juice into the socket, because it's like trying to pivot a rubber ball in a sandpaper socket...  It sticks.  Oh, then then there's the fact that the right stick also doesn't press in as a button like it should.  No, instead that's also apparently broken in a way that if the game has a zoom function, it decides to do so at random.  This makes playing any game that requires both sticks impossible to enjoy and nearly impossible to play.  I will be returning this and spending the extra money on a new one instead...	-1
This game in one word ...! Get the Madden 2001 and don't even bother with this game. I got it and played it once and had to take it out. Terrible graphics and shotty game play. Bottom line, don't even buy it!	-1
NFL Gameday 2001- Bad graphics (Playstation 1 graphics on the Playstation2 system) o.k. gameplay Madden 2001 The best graphics yet for anything (even computer) Has to be the best gameplay of any football game yet. I saw a review of NFL Gameday 2001 in a Playstation magazine....and it showed a picture of a quarterback throwing the football... The football, as it left the quarterbacks hands traveled right....his hand was throwing to the left. WHATS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?! I don't like putting games down, but buy Madden 2001 first, then rent Gameday 2001 after....compare, then write a review for both. :-)	-1
Don't bother with this one.  This game is no way near as polished as Madden 2001.  I think the only people who will enjoy this game are those who are die-hard fans of the Game Day series.  The gameplay, presentation, and style is actually very similar to the previous generation Game Days, but the game just goes downhill in terms of presentation and graphics.  For the first time, there simply is no comparison between Madden and GameDay.  Madden 2001.  Hands down.	-1
Arrived broken	-1
Right when i got it, it had a lot of dust on it.. i cleaned it off with a napkin, plugged it in my ps2 and only some buttons work :( I shouldve just bbought one at game stop...ohwell thats what i get i guess :( im not planning on using it.	-1
did not work at all had to buy new ones	-1
it a fake	-1
This controller didn't work properly almost from the get go.  Terrible... and I am writing a review very late, because I do not use this rating system.  It's not worth it.	-1
Well this never happened before. I selected the option to have this product new instead of used. Clicked buy and waited. Got an e-mail a day later,stating my product had shipped and I could track its progress. Ok, all this is normal. At this point its sunday. The e-mail indicates the package will be delivered on either the following friday or monday. OK. On Saturday. I receive an e-mail from Amazon. Telling me the package was never sent,the merchant cancelled it,and my card had been refunded. Totally bizarre. So what did I do? I ordered the same product from another retailer. And now I have it. Its new ,made by Sony and it works just fine. This is the 1st time Amazon has let me down. The 1 star indicates my displeasure with Amazon, I feel they should have contacted another merchant to get me this product. I'm not angry, I'm just like wow bummer.	-1
so i got this controller and i thought it would work since it was like buying one from a store but i was dissapointed because this didn't work and i won't buy anything else from this seller.	-1
Most have claimed it works on ps1 but this one does not for any of my ps1 games. Meh meh.	-1
NUNCA LLEGO PORQUE ???????????????  ??????? ???? ????? ????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ???? ???? ???? ?????? ?????? ?????? ????? ????? ??????	-1
I can't get through the simplest of battles because the buttons on this controller are so iffy. Makes game playing a real pain in the butt.	-1
I was never a fan of the Playstation 2 controller.  I don't like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad. Using an analog stick is annoying because you don't feel comfortable with it. Ask any older gamer- they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad. With an analog stick, you slide all over the place. In addition to that disaster, the PS2 controller also suffers from "too many buttons". We shouldn't have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game. The Playstation One had the best controller ever. It was comfortable, you were always in complete control, and it just looked better.	-1
The Playstation controller is nice. However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy, maybe even more so. The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both. The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit. This controller feels great with the thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement. Suddenly in 2005, four years after the PS2 was released, games like Metal Gear Solid III: Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini-games feature. The controller has been given new life because of this.  The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality. This controller, for all its design, will give you a dual shock. First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break. Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1, L2 or R1, R2 wing buttons. Even if you don't drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming. The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw. Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more. The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink. I have never seen one that managed to remain straight. Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you don't need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it.  For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust. I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model. Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something. The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit. It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust. I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time. Make these controllers more robust please. The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly.	-1
Hell you need it to play games and that is the only reason you need one of these, third party controllers are better and not as flimsy but most won't work with your ps2 so your stuck with the duel shock 2. My main problems with this thing is how breakable it you can't squeeze it to hard accidently drop it because it will break it has bappened to me many times, you must be really careful with it or you will be stuck payin the outrageous price twenty bucks which is too much for how breakable it is. Other than it works.	-1
I unwittingly bought a PS2, not knowing that I'd get a god awfull small game controller. I used it for a month and now I can't hardly move my hands or my fingers. Don't buy Playstation 2. They've ruined my future. I'm writing this review right now by using a voice typing program that Microsoft published especially for people who've ended up in my poor situation. (P.S. buy an xbox instead, their controllers are much bigger)	-1
I hate this controller. It is so small and uncomfortable to hold. The analog buttons are placed in the worst spots. It is WAY too small to support the anolog buttons (2 Fat Black Blobs), D-Pad, Triangle, Rectangle, Square and X.	-1
To all that purchase pre-owned products. Please make sure you know the item works, so you do not have to return it. This memory card that I just bought does not even work. I just had to go buy another one that actually does. I would advise that you purchase through a Amazon fulfilled vendor and not anyone else. My kid was so upset at the fact that this item didn't work.	-1
This memory card hasn't been reliable, my first one stopped working out of the blue after a few months.  When I replaced it, thinking that I just was unlucky, the new one is already having problems after a few weeks with corrupt data.	-1
First, there is nothing about this to really write home about. It is a memory cart. You have to have it else your PS2 is worthless as a game machine. Most games won't even play unless you have one, so you have to have one. My main gripe is the memory size. 8MB? C'mon! WRC and GTA3 both take up almost 1/3 of the capacity of this cart for their save games. And it is going to get worse. Where are the 64MB carts? Save yourself some money and don't buy this single pack. There is a twin pack of cards for only a few dollars more.	-1
At close to ($price) Sony's official memory card is way overpriced.  It probably costs them $2 or $3 to make it but we end up paying dearly.  Unfortunately you should not buy third-party memory products; none of them offers complete compatibility with the PS2.  Sony's memory is slow, but at least reliable.	-1
I'll admit this is not my kind of game, but after the reviews, I bought a cheap, used copy.  For me, this is a total snooze fest, but if you like puzzle solving games like Mist and others, this might be for you.	-1
i got this game a few years ago...many years after it came out. so many good reviews, but when i played it i wanted to hurt the people that made it and not allow the creators to do make anything else(but they redeemed themselves with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Shadow-of-the-Colossus/dp/B0009I6S0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Shadow of the Colossus</a>&nbsp;A+.  Pointless adventure, worthless story, hideous game play. SotC is where this company shines. forget this game, get SotC.  they might be coming out with a ICO/SotC PS3 upscaled HD game...i recommend getting that only for SotC	-1
I've had 2 PS2's so far and none of the blue discs seem to play in them. The first PS2 I had I tried to play tribes that didn't work. Then my second PS2 I tried to play ICO. The graphics were good i'll give you that, but my PS2 has a hard time loading everything up. I'll give this game 2 stars overall because of the graphis in the cutscenes that I did see. As far as gameplay goes couldn't tell you the thing wouldn't work. I recommend renting this game first to make sure your PS2 is capable of reading the blue discs.	-1
I wanted to like this game,really I did. I love fantasy,books,games,movies etc. And the concept for ICO is a good one. But man, this game is painfully boring,and slow. Its one of the most boring games I have ever played. For hardcore puzzle lovers only.	-1
I don't really consider this a game. Yes, it is very different. But, what is good in diffrence is bad in gameplay. The princess cannot climb chains at all. Can't she feel a chain? COME ON! The combat is stupid. Look at me! I'm hitting black shadows with a stick! WOW! The puzzles are interesting, but i hate that call that Ico has when calling for Yorda. SQUAWK! Also, PLEASE TRANSLATE YORDA! Maybe i'm not a fan of puzzle games. Oh well.	-1
Why is it when developers unleash a franchise game they tend to get lazy and contemptuous with their design?  For years I've been waiting for a good Gundam game, so it was with great excitement that I launched into this game.  What Bandai delivered is a game that has great visuals and a wonderful cast of characters from past and present Gundam series, but a fighting game that is lukewarm at best, absolutely horrendous at worst. Badly balanced characters is the worst aspect of this game.  I've finished the game with every character by now, but every time I have to fight "Psycho Gundam MkII", it's still one of the most unpleasantly ill-balanced fights I've ever come across.  I know some gamers equate difficulty with fun and unfairness with challenge, but fighting a computer character whose every hit takes off about eight times more energy than you do isn't exactly my idea of fun (and I'm not talking about a Psycho Crusher-style, one-time-only super move either).  Even among the usable characters, Zeong (possibly my favourite Gundam character ever) and Quin Mantha are quite weak, but The-O is lopsidedly powerful. There aren't that many playing options, either -- the Vs. mode doesn't offer that many more characters to choose from; the Story mode has laughable, generic Japanese anime cliche dialogue ("I'm as tough as they come", "I'll destroy you", etc.), and the ending is so flimsy I would've rather not had any ending at all. Being a huge Gundam fan, I still give this game an extra star.  Based on gameplay alone, this is a real stinker.  The only point of recommendation is really for the characters.  Sure, it's fun to play as Sazabi or Zaku II, but does that make up for a very bad fighting engine, dirt-poor response and careless design?  Not for me.	-1
This game was a very fast, easy, boring game. It wasn't fun because most of the game was clips from the Star Wars movies. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it would show some excitment to young begining players.	-1
Disc arrived scratched. Skipped a lot. Had to have local game store re surface it.	-1
The seller of this game gear is miss guided. The game gear did have its own charger this one on the other hand doesn't come with one. And to let everyone know since I use to have a game gear the battery life on this is very slim to none and not worth buying battery's for it since it doesn't last longer then 2 days if even that my advice is to get a A/C charger for it your thank me later. Also I think the charger for the Sega Genesis also works for the game gear but don't quote me on it	-1
Outdated system buy something new	-1
First of all, I must say that when I was a kid, I had ALWAYS wanted a Sega Game Gear!! They Kicked the Gameboys butt!!  Color Screen, and an eight bit processor that was every bit as good as the internal processors for the sega master system (actually almost identical, in fact, you can actually get an adapter to play master system games on a game gear, and the adapter dosen't even take extra power at all nor have any processors inside of it, it just directly adapts a master system cartridge to fit a game gear, thats it) and to be fully honest, when you play some games that were made for the nes and the game gear both, most of the games look better on Game Gear, just to be totally honest. (I've had both systems, more on that later). One flaw in the system is the battery life. Not good!! It takes 6 AA batteries and this sucker will drain them in 4-6 hours (in my experience)  one day, I was at a yard sale and low and behold, I found a Game Gear!! For $1!!! No Crap!  The sound didn't work, but it did work out of the headphones. Everything else was perfect!!  I played on this game gear for quite a while until the headphones stopped working as well. I looked it up online and discovered this is an EXTREMELY common issue with game gears. It turns out that when the game gear came out in 1990, there were a bunch of bad capacitors on the market at that time. Most of the game gears got these bad capacitors, not all of them, but MOST of them. I must say, that I do have a very extensive background in electronics, (I majored  in computer hardware design and repair in college.) So I immediately replaced all of the capacitors on the soundboard of the game gear. The speakers started working immediately, and the headphones started working great as well. In fact, when I got done with the system it was very LOUD out of the speaker!  I bought probably 20-30 games for the game gear and loved 70% of them, then I started notticing that the screen was getting almost impossible to see. You had to hold the thing at a very odd angle in order to see anything, and the contrast had to be all the way up. I looked this problem up as well, and guess what. When you replace the capacitors for the screen, you really must replace ALL OF THE CAPACITORS IN THE ENTIRE GAME GEAR in order to get it to work properly!!! I did this. For the longest time, I would even take my game gear to pawn shops just to show it off, time after time I was told "this is the best screen I have ever seen on a game gear" and "I've never seen one of these work so well!! " I would ask how much they would give me for it, and I heard anywhere from 70-80 dollars.  I loved the game gear, for another year if that (or 6 months) when the screen went out again. It was perfect after I replaced the capacitors, even better than the nintendo ds screens in terms of clarity and brightness in my opinion, now the thing wasn't working. So I opened the thing up one more time, to see that the screen was leaking fluid!!  Guess what, This is common as well!! Just replace the screen for 40-50 dollars for a good one!  I gave up on it!  So basically, I do love the system, but do research on it! Not all of them have these problems, but MOST do!! If you have, or buy a game gear that has the sound going out of it, all of these other things WILL happen as well, its just a matter of time!  It may last a few years, or maybe just one year like mine did, but as I said earlier, do your research!  Great Games include : Sonic the Hedgehog Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sonic Tripple Trouble Sonic Chaos Streets of Rage Streets of Rage 2 Outrun (not Europa) GT Racer Formula 1 Mortal Kombat 2 Nba Jam Arch Rivals Paperboy Sonic drift Sonic drift 2 Jeopardy Wheel of Fortune Fred Couples Golf Joe montana Football many many more!!  Terrible Games (In my opinion) Monster Truck Wars Outrun Europa Mortal Kombat basically every other racing game basically every other golf game that stupid tails game the Terminator Game ( cant think of the exact name, lol nor care to) crash test dummies all loony toons games aladdin probably more, that I haven't played.	-1
I bought one when they came out, and they were better than the gameboy and gameboy color, but not gameboy advance. The GBA has a sharper screen, much better graphics and sound. It is smaller and more comfortable, takes less batteries and lasts longer on those batteries.  Also I don't know of any game gear games that are 3 and 4 player capable, so you couldn't (and certianly never will in the future), play awesome multiplayer games like Mario Kart, Mario Advance, Advance Wars, Doom, and the new Zelda game with 4 player support (I forgot the name of it.) It really makes no sense why anyone would want one of these nowadays, unless your really poor and ghetto...	-1

I HAVE READ MANY REVIEWS ON THE GAME GEAR AND I AM DISGUSTED WITH THE REVIEWERS WHO DIDN'T DO ANY RESEARCH (ALL OF THEM). THEY INSIST THAT IT IS SOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN THE GAME BOY ADVANCE. THE GAME GEAR IS TOO BIG TO EVEN FIT IN YOUR POCKET. IT IS REALLY BULKY. SURE, THE BACK LIT SCREEN IS NICE, BUT THAT ADDS TO THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE SYSTEM. IT ALSO TAKES 6 AA BATTERIES AND DRAINS THEM EXTREMELY FAST. THE GAME BOY ADVANCE RUNS ON 2 AA BATTERIES AND LAST 15 HOURS. THE REVIEWS STATE THAT THE GBA IS THE SAME AS THE GAME BOY COLOR AND THE GAME GEAR IS A BETTER SYSTEM. WELL, HERE ARE SOME EYE OPENERS FOR YOU: >>>THE GAME GEAR CAN DISPLAY 4,096 DIFFERENT COLORS, 32 AT ANY TIME. THE GAME BOY ADVANCE CAN DISPLAY 32,000 COLORS, 511 AT ANY TIME. THAT IS MORE THAN A 25,000 COLOR DIFFERENCE. >>>THE GAME BOY ADVANCE IS 4 TIMES AS POWERFUL AS A GAME BOY COLOR AND 2 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN A SUPER NINTENDO. >>>THE GBA CAN DISPLAY 128 MOVING OBJECTS AT ONCE. LETS LEE A GAME GEAR DO THAT... HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE READ THIS REVIEW AND MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE.	-1
This game is has many things wrong with it.  First of all, the controls are some of the worst that I have ever seen.  There is no smooth movement in Oni.  It is very choppy, making it hard to control your character.  Second, the camera angles are horrific: there are parts were the camera decides to zoom and unzoom, especially when fighting and it makes it very hard to see who you are fighting.  The graphics are halfway decent but nothing worth looking at.  The best thing about this game is that I kept the receipt.	-1
Oni should have a lot of appeal: it's got a pseudo-anime look, well-done 3D characters, a great hand-to-hand fighting system.  Unfortunately, it's got a horrible aiming system for many of the guns, an idiotic save game system, and wildly varying difficulty.  And the character design for Konoko in the anime opening is 1) ugly, 2) varies within the movie itself, and 3) looks nothing like the character as drawn either on the box or the 3D polygonal Konoko.  Most of all, this game has none of the gameplay magic found in Bungie's other games, particularly Myth and Myth II. A little explanation of the problems.  The save game system is easy enough: you don't know when it's going to save, there are relatively few save points, and the save points frequently don't tie into the game world, so you'll be stuck fighting some difficult point over again if you die.  The aiming system for guns varies with the gun, but for the pistols and submachine guns, it's virtually impossible to hit anyone (thankfully, that's true of the enemies, too).  There's also almost no ammo to be found in the game world.  It's easier to lure enemies around a corner and go hand-to-hand.  More fun, too.  The difficulty level is annoying: at first, it's pathetically easy; later on, you start facing three or four enemies, some of whom appear out of nowhere while you're fighting. Frankly, Bungie bungled this game.  Coulda been great; came out poor.	-1
This game is very strange. I've never seen such strong elements in an overall pretty lousy game. With the "strong elements" I mean the fights. These fights cause a huge adrenaline-rush. There are a lot of moves and it looks and plays very good. But there are a lot of bad things about this game... For example, the overall gameplay is very bad. 18 levels long you'll have to pull a switch, go through an opened door, whack some baddies and pull a switch again and go through a door again and... you get my point. This game has also got one of the worst save-options ever known to mankind. The game saves automatically at certain points, but you'll have to complete the level because if you restart the game the save-points are gone! This is only done because if you could save yourself you'll finish it in about 8 hours. But there's something even worse... after completing 10 levels I took a break and when I came back I accidentally pressed "new game". No problem, I thought, just load my old game again, but... The $^$#&#&^# game ERASED MY SAVES!!! The whole city trembled of the scream that left my mouth (hmmm... maybe only the neighbourhood ;) The graphics are not bad, but very boring. The levels are completely non-interactive. It's a shame that Bungie put such a beautiful fightingsystem in such a lousy game. So... don't buy this game! (....)	-1
I agree with others that this is not the best model out there.  But with InterAct having problems, and Saitek offering the port for controller (so you don't have to keep taking out), I don't think you have much choice at the moment. The control is horrendous, and not very intuitive.  It took me awhile to figure out that the stop button is actually enter and using the pad to scroll up/down/left/right is ridiculously hard. Hopefully, Sony will come up with a controller of their own.  Until then, get this since other ones are useless as well.	-1
I was being cheap and got this instead of the offical Sony remote. I think I'll be getting the Sony model now, and wasted (my money) on this.  The buttons often have to be pressed more than once, and maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the back chapter button goes to the begining of the current title, but I can't go futher back. So I have to stop the dvd and forward to the point I want. (...)	-1
This thing is junk. The pass-through simply did not work. I could only use the controller or the remote stub, but not both. Other reviews complain of button mashing or slow response from the remote. I didn't notice. It worked fine and I couldn't see a difference between any other tv/dvd remote and this one. If you have the patience to constantly swap the stub and controller for gaming or dvd playback, this might be an okay remote. Otherwise, surely something better is on the market.	-1
I bought this thing and tried it.  It doesn't work very well, and the response is slow.  Trust me don't buy it.  Wait for the Sony Remote.  I think it comes out this fall.	-1
From what I hear, this is the best remote on the market.  But that is not true.  I have found that the PS2 joystick works the best.  Because the PS2 requires you to hold down the button to search through a movie the remote is ineffective.  It is only good for pushing play and stop.  The signal always breaks so you can't search.  Also it is difficult to select a frame.  I guess if you really need a remote this is the one to get from what I hear, but if I was you I would just use your joystick until something better comes out on the market.	-1
I've never played the original Gangsters but I've heard enough horror stories to know what was wrong with it, but despite all the flaws people complained of everyone still seemed to enjoy the original.  So when I saw the sequel on the store shelf I thought to myself that it would probably have all those flaws improved upon while still keeping it's great strategy elements.  So I bought the game hoping to be able to live out my favorite scenes from the Godfather.  At first the game was amusing, but after those quick 10 minutes, the game was quickly repackaged and returned! First off, the strategy elements of the game are completely gone!  Everyone used to complain about the micro-management in the first, so I guess the solution was to completely erase all management. You're basically told what business to buy and it just generates money. The graphics are a bit cartoonish, but fitting.  Although the graphics aren't realistic or polygonal they match the theme of the game and give it the appropriate feel.  Unfortunately, that's all this game has!  Good looks, good packaging, no substance! The gameplay is terrible!  You'll pull your hair out as you order your goons to drive two blocks away and watch him circle around the whole neighborhood before finally going to his destination... and hopefully he's not there to do a drive-by!  The drive-by shootings in this game are just ridiculous.  You'll quickly despise watching your thugs drive past, shoot, make a U-turn, drive back, shoot more, make another U-turn, shoot (you get the point).  That doesn't seem like a very effective drive-by to me.  Also, the people standing on the side walk never EVER take cover, they just stand there shooting at the car until they are FINALLY gunned down.  What kind of dumb gangsters are these anyway?  The AI definately needs improving!  Also, don't get your car ruined.  If you do, then you have the option of stealing your enemies car, but only HIS car.  What sense does this make?  My thugs have no problem with gunning down police officers but they refuse to steal an innocent person's car.  I had to run 4 blocks (past rows and rows of perfectly good parked cars) to my enemies hideout to steal his vehicle.  But basically what I am saying is that the AI in the game is pretty stupid. Another thing that ruins the gameplay is the tedious and repetative missions.  The game is basically open this shop, do a hit on this guy, buy that building, place guards here, do a hit on that guy... over and over and over again.  And although carrying out a "hit" should normally be enjoyable, as you can tell from my paragraph above I found killing people to be quite the chore. So if all of the micro-management is now non-existant and all of the action is absolutely horrendous and silly, what does this game have to offer?  Simply put... boredom.  The game is just too easy, too simple, and too shallow.  Perhaps for the third game they should eliminate the tedious missions and make it more open-ended.  Just allow you to hire thugs and build your empire.  Also, they need to work on that AI a little.  Why do these guys get lost in a neighborhood that's 5 blocks wide?  And who ever heard of circling back around, better yet, making a U-turn while doing a drive-by?  You're supposed to shoot and then high tail it outta there!  Basically, it could have been a good game had they taken the time out to actually add some gameplay to it.	-1
Don't get me wrong, I consider myself to be a pretty die-hard Myst fan, and I love all of my fellow reviewers with as much of my soul as I can muster, but I feel the need to issue a complaint about this wretched piece of junk that calls itself a game! When I first saw Myst, I thought it was the most amazing thing I had ever laid eyes on, I was reminded of La Jetee, the old Chris Marker film in which we are given thirty minutes of still photographs telling a love story across time, space, death and reality. The film as well as the game opened the door for a whole new kind of narrative, one that was not reliant on the spectacle of motion. So, when I saw and purchased this game, I was weary of its potential offense. My weariness was not in vain as I asked myself: DOES IT NEED TO MOVE? Just because a picture is worth a thousand words does not at all mean that fifteen or more pictures a second, sixty seconds a minute, sixty minutes an hour, nine hours a typical playing session does not mean that the game is worth up to and including 500 million words! Frankly, I can only think of two: PURE DRIVEL! Anyone ever hear of the Kuleshov Effect? The Homeric Exposition? The Triptych Manifest? The Neurological Function of Visual Closure? No? Well, basically they all refer to your brain's ability to put two and two together to make four. You see one image immediately followed by another without viewing any of the action that exists between them, just like when in a movie our POV changes from one character facing right to another character faving left. This make sense to us because, by our brain's ability to fill in gaps in the action, we assume that these two characters are looking at each other. What, you can't tell what has happened between two images of a library in which one image shows the library-as well as its surroundings-as appearing closer to you in the frame than in the previous image? YOU'VE MOVED FORWARD, (...) Okay, perhaps I'm being a little too cruel, but it just annoys me to no end that there are those out there who feel that making still images move (rather than simply appreciate the beauty they present to you in stillness) somehow enhances the visual awe of art. Maybe if you have only a passing interest in the Myst mythos, and you enjoy solving puzzles far more than viewing such fine specimens of computer aesthetics, perhaps you will enjoy this game, otherwise, stick with the original and its sequels. I'm sorry I was angry, it's just that, as a filmmaker looking to altnerative, mold-breaking techniques of entertainment, I felt the need to uphold the integrity of the Miller Brothers, and the good sir Marker.	-1
I am an avid Myst/Riven/MystIII fan. I bought realMyst to see the advanced graphics added to it..ie: Day,Night,Rain,Sun,and special effects. The game is really choppy. I even advanced my system, but it didn't help. I believe you shouldnt have to go any kind of frustration when playing a game and this one had a lot of choppiness and delayed reactions even after I upgraded my system. Too frustrating.	-1
Yes, the graphics are very good but the game is akin to an interactive painting. And so what about the graphics? Whoopee, most games have good graphics nowadays too but GOOD games have some meat to them. RealMyst does not; it's a very bland game for people who don't like real gaming experiences. After fifty minutes of looking at the pretty pictures, I was bored to tears and began the uninstall procedure. Phooey!	-1
I had never played Myst before and I wanted to give it a try because of its popularity.  My biggest gripe is that the game offers no options. Every game I know of allows a player to customize the controls.  I always use the inverted mouse look--pull back, look up; push forward, look down.  I use this in Quake, Unreal, Thief II,  Hitman codename 47, Forsaken, System shock 2, Half-Life etc. etc.  Real Myst does not give me a choice, and I am not going to change my personal style for one game.  The mouse is too sensitive, and there is no option to adjust it (as in other games).  The "walk" mode is way too fast.  So, just try playing a game where you seem to be running all the time, the mouse operates backwards, and is too sensitive in its left to right movement.  Well, I can just stand there and admire all the scenery, I guess. My system is a Dell XPS B733r (733 Mhz coppermine, PIII) with a geForce 256, 64MB DDR RAM 3D card, 128MB RDRAM, Soundblaster Live audio.  Actually, the music in the game is very nice, and the graphics great.	-1

BEWARE!!! Im posting pictures of what you will receive if you purchase this product from this company. IT ARRIVED DEFECTIVE! This is NOT the "red" memo card as displayed!

Well Level 5 had to start somewhere. So they gave us this... a blend of a roguelike dungeon crawler and Soul Blazer town rejuvenating. This game has its charms, and in the beginning is actually kind of fun. Crafting your own weapons and designing the town layouts are the strongest highlights. However, about midway through the charm wears off, and the formula becomes all too tedious. Basically Level 5 took what should be a 12 hour game and used time wasting methods to stretch that out to 30 hours. To see things through to the end, you'll need a mountain of patience and a bit of a masochistic streak (especially for the last boss). Supposedly Dark Cloud 2 (AKA Dark Chronicle) fixes all the problems this game has. So I would suggest skipping this one and going straight to its sequel instead.	-1
did not work w/ my 64	-1
I've played dozens of games in the this genre, and while this might have been great in its day, every mechanic in Dark Cloud is done better by another title I've enjoyed more.  Compared against other mystery dungeon runners on PS2, The Nightmare of Druaga is much better, and Baroque just blows this game out of the water on style points. If you are an adult gamer who likes sci-fi, and wants a unique mystery dungeon experience, buy Baroque PS2 instead.  "Repetitive" is the game's theme. Graphics aren't varied -- only tunnels and the same rooms, with no secret tunnels/areas that make the genre surprising and enjoyable.  (Azure Dreams on ps1 does this so much better...)  The "lock on" makes the camera go crazy, and crazy cameras give me a headache. So because this function was useless, I was forced into clumsily seeking after enemies, who often got easy hits on me, and that experience quickly bored and annoyed me because I fighting the controls, not the monsters. I only played for a few hours before I decided there were randomized mystery dungeon games I enjoy more with similar themes. (This is no Zelda... heck, it's not even as fun as Dark Legion: Vampire Apocalypse or Chocobo's Dungeon.)  Don't buy this one.	-1
Not performance brand. Corrupts frequently.	-1
makes my controller stop working doesn't work	-1
I give the graphics a good grade. The story an F. This game needed more dialog. I did like how it was a lot like soulblazer or actraiser, building the city. the music gets repetitive. I don't really understand why this game got good reviews. Its mediocre at best....	-1
I can't even really say this is a fake Zelda, because they tried to copy and came up with a repetitous counterfeit. Over 100 hours of the same thing, over and over again. I maxed out my sword and didn't even get a reward. I wouldn't wish this life stealer on my worst enemy, that's why I through it in the garbage. Negative -5 and yes, I beat it. Ocarina Of Time a positive +1,000 stars.	-1
Dark Cloud is a Zelda/Actraiser hybrid that seems to try too hard to be perfect on the town buidling part and neglects some things in the dungeon battles. For one, having to throw powder on your weapon to keep it from breaking is stupid. What idiot thought that idea up? Plus the weapon building system is long and complex and not really explained well enough. They should just have better weapons lying in treasure chests as you go along.	-1
This is a wicked bad game. Its its also wicked hard. Basically all you do is run a round like a mad man and kill things. Sounds fun. Guess what. ITS NOT. I mean you have to repair your weapon!! What the heck is that all about. And theres boxes that you open and they turn into ENEMYS! YUCK!	-1
It seams all of u never finished the game it gets soooo hard that u cant stand it and u stop playing its vary annoying.	-1

Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply.  After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.  (This is a review that I originally wrote on 07/27/2002) --------------------------------------------------  I *LOVE*&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Grand-Theft-Auto-3/dp/B00005O0I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>&nbsp;(for the Playstation 2) and I wanted a game that would be similar to it. I know that no game, except for possibly GTA4, could even come close to GTA3, but I still wanted "more." From what I read about this game, it seemed like a poor man's GTA3. I had&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Driver-1/dp/B000034DMT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Driver 1</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PC/dp/B00001W0J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PC</a>, but could never actually play the game itself because I could not pass that stupid driving test at the beginning of "Undercover" mode. When I read that Driver 2 did not have a driving test, that gave me even more reason to want it.  GAMEPLAY  When I popped the game into my PS2, I immediately went into "Free Ride" mode so that I could get a feel for the controls and check out the scenery a bit. I didn't even move one inch when the cops were after me. Yes, that's right, I was STANDING STILL and the cops were on my b-u-t-t. If the cops are going to be on me like white on rice, I'd at least like to know WHY. I gave the cops no resistance, allowing them the chance to come up to the car and pull me out (like real cops would, and those in GTA3), but they thought it would be best to just keep ramming me!?!  Since this game lacks the Police Bribes and the Pay And Spray of GTA3, the only way I could get the cops off my tail and reduce my felony meter (the equivalent of GTA3's Wanted stars meter) was to hitail it out of there in the hopes that I could lose them. Even though the game promises that you can wipe your felony meter clean by getting out of your vehicle and carjacking another one, since you can't get out of the car and switch vehicles while being wanted/chased, there's no practical use of this "feature."  I decided to try the main "Undercover" mode, hoping that it would be better. The first mission was simple enough. Get from point A to point B. The first time I tried it I failed it because I didn't get to the place on time (I was going the wrong way from the start). Once I figured out that all I had to do was make two lefts then go right every chance I could, I got to the destination with time to spare. Mission 1 Passed! Perhaps this game WOULD get better ... until Mission 2, that is!  Mission 2 involves you having to follow another car. The problem is, unless you're (at most) two car lengths behind him, the game will say that you lost him and thus failed the mission ... even though his car is clearly visible on the screen! After attempting this mission three or four more times, only to get as far as around the corner, I had enough punishment and immediately decided to bring the game back to the store with my Mom's receipt to get a different game. ANY game would be better, even Barney The Dinosaur!  Not even cheats codes could help make this game playable. I used two Game Shark codes to unlock the in-game Invincibility and Immunity (no felony) cheats. However, neither of these would help with mission 2. The Infinite Time Game Shark code would not work, otherwise I *might* have had a chance of barely playing the game ... the key words there are "might" and "barely."  GRAPHICS  This game has the WORST graphics ever seen in a video game of any age. Pong and Pac-Man look high-tech compared to this.  There is more pop-up in Driver 2 than in a marathon of Pop-Up Video on VH-1. You look ahead and see an open piece of land. You plan to cut across that land in order to make the turn at a high speed without having to slow down (or just to take a shortcut). Just as you get within a car's length of that land, a building pops up out of nowhere. BAM! You crashed and damaged your car. Repeat indefinitely and you've got the graphics of Driver 2.  REPLAYABILITY  In order to have replayability, a game must first have playability.  TO BUY OR TO RENT?  NEITHER!  I wouldn't even give the CD to my dog as a chew toy.  If it were possible, I would have given this game a 0 rating. Then again, it kinda deserves the 1 because it has one redeeming quality: it makes a great coaster!	-1
Driver 2 was a good game when it came out.  However, now that Playstation 2 and Grand Theft Auto 3 have been released, there is literally no reason to bother with this game.  The graphics look bad, even for PS1.  The frame rate is choppy, and the missions are so ridiculous that you will find yourself doing them over and over again.  There are many annoying glitches as well, like falling through the street for no reason (game over), and cops that smash your car over or through walls and buildings, trapping your vehicle in them.  Also, the vehicles seem to drive VERY SLOWLY on the streets.  pedestrians run from your car to avoid being hit, and if your car does hit them, they pass through the vehicle as if through thin air. I will give some credit to this game-- the "take a ride" feature allows you to drive freely through very realistic renderings of Chicago, Havana, Las Vegas and Rio.  The cops, however, will chase you for no reason and smash your car until it is destroyed-- that is unless you can outrun them.	-1
Received this item brand new. Still sealed in the package. Soon as I installed it in the controller. It said it was corrupt and would not save. Bad out of the box. Save your money and your time, don't purchase this item.	-1
I have 3 of these memory cards and 2 of them are corrupted. Even though they worked not too long ago. The Performance Memory for the N64 is fickle in that it works great sometimes for long periods, and then it suddenly decides to corrupt all your data. It's frustrating. Just like Memory cards for all systems it's best to go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/official-Nintendo-64-Controller-Pak/dp/B00004S9A7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">official Nintendo 64 Controller Pak</a>. It may not hold as many "pages" of memory, but it'll be a more secure way of saving your data.  As a warning, try to stay away from generic memory for the Gamecube, PS1, and PS2 as well. I don't know what it is about all these third party companies that make memory for systems, but it's never reliable.	-1
The frame rate is realy bad, and the pop up is pure death! Auto Destruct was a good game, it came out in 1997, but it didn't have this much damn pop up! The first Driver felt like it was based in th 70s, but this felt like it was based in the 90s, but with 70s cars. It's just ugly! I'll sell it, if I can find anyone who wants it!	-1
Driver 1 is one of my all time favorite games so of course I went out and bought Driver 2 as soon as it came out. When I played it I couldn't believe that this was made by the same company that made the first outstanding game. The graphics are hardly impressive, the control is loose, the speed is sluggish and it's just not a user friendly game. At some points you end up hating the game because you have to restart so much each time you fail a mission. They made this game extremely hard. My friend is a gaming fanatic. He plays games all day everyday. He's an expert at them. But even he couldn't get past the first disc of this game. We've both given up. Now, if I'm going to play Driver 2 it's just for the free drives around the cities. I'm looking forward to a Driver 3 on Playstation 2 but I hope Infogrames will fix all the problems this sequel had.	-1
One general word of advice.  Whenever you see a game that says "randomly generated dungeons".........run.  A few high profile failures have tried this, (Anarchy Online anyone?).  The problem with random dungeons is just that........the whole game seems random.  There is no sense of fighting thru the underlings, to get to the "boss".  Yes there is a boss at the end of every dungeon, but there is no progression that's immersive. The graphics are also very "cutesy".  This is a good game for children under 12 or so, would be a nice first "RPG" for someone, but for serious gamers it becomes very boring very quickly. By far the most "fun" to be had in this game is goofing around arranging the towns you have to put back together.  Unfortunately, most of your time is spent in random dungeons, fighting random mobs, and it all begins to look the same VERY quickly. Rental only	-1
Great concept, but if you don't mind the game play slowing you down because the playstation can't keep up (oh and by the way the person you are chasing doesn't slow down) then its a great game the will just frustrate the hell out of you.	-1
This was a BAD game.  Graphics were sub-par.  Gameplay was easy.  After one weekend of playing, I almost completed everything.  For an RPG, give me a challange, please.	-1
Driver 2 is a poor game for the Playstation. The Wheelman is back in driver 2 for playstation and who truly cares about it?  Why this game was produced for the Playstation is beyond me.  This is a game that is meant for the PC and not the limited processor of a Playstation.  I saw the difference in the orginal Driver for Playstation and Driver for the PC and the gameplay experience was completely different.  I'll wait for the creators to code Driver 2 to the PC, so we can actually enjoy the game.  The graphics are horrible, horrible and horrible.  Anyone who says the graphics are excellent must have some bad eyes or have never seen any other game system besides a playstation much less a computer.  During the Gameplay it is very apparent that the coders of the game did not fully optimize the game for Playstation as you can see in many parts of the game where the framerate drops.  The framerate drops?  What the heck is this on a Playstation?  I have not seen any processor or memory upgrades for a playstation, so why would a game I am playing be too much for the playstation to play without any errors or holdups much less framerate drops.  This is totally ridiculous!  I have a very good feeling that the creators of Driver 2 made a PC version first then coded it back to Playstation format which would explain the buggy and slow gameplay in some areas.  I do have to admit the game is very fun to play and would be even more enjoyable if the game would actually be better than the orginal.  The mission are very good and you can pass them easily if your gameplay does not slow down, but if it does you will be pushing the restart button after you fail the mission.  The cutscenes are ok and I just love the beginning scene where the man with the sawed off double barrelled shot gun fires off about 8 shots without reloading, very clever indeed.  RENT, do buy this game unless the only thing you have in your house is a Playstation.  And if I see a Driver 3 for playstation, I might just drive myself into a wall in frustation.	-1
This game is absolutely horrendous.  You go back and forth to the same ugly looking dungeon looking for georama pieces.  On top of that he gets thirsty every 30 seconds and is sword breaks which makes it weaker.  Very very annoying.  What is up with the building of the town?  I want to play an RPG not sit there and build a town.  If I wanted to manage a town I would go play Sim City or something like that.  I bought this game a  while ago, and played for a total of about 2-3 hours before saying "screw this" and shelving it forever.  I recently bought a game called ICO, which is also made by Sony, now that is a masterpiece (Sony's redemption).  This is a horrible title, go buy ICO instead you'll be happier...trust me.	-1
Little phrases describe this game better than "waste of time". Once players get past the needlessly lengthy (and unskippable) 2 minutes of opening cinematics, they're 'treated' to some of the worst gameplay, realism and overall fun on the otherwise fantastic Playstation console. Each level is filled with unnecessarily difficult quirks, ranging from invincible opponents to hidden obstacles. A picket fence now has to power to halt a speeding automobile dead in its tracks, as does a small dumpster. One level asks you to 'highjack a truck', getting to mention that this 12 ton hauler can out-accellerate and handle your 2-ton sports car. Adding to the "fun factor" is the unwavering, needlessly impervious opponent that starts directly behind you, pushing you out of control almost instantly. As a sort of cherry on top, you're given a time limit. What fun. I enjoyed the original Driver, and found myself hoping for something similar here. Alas; no such luck. Don't make the same mistake I did... you'd be better off spending your money elsewhere.	-1
Before the game was released, everytime the name "Dark Cloud" was mentioned, you're bound to see the name "Zelda Killer" in there too.  Well, I'm sorry, but it's not.  Zelda, has a better story and better gameplay.  Ture, the "georama"  feature is cool, you get to build your own towns and place anything whereever you want but it's just not enough.  Most of the game, you're going through dungines, looking for the pieces to build the towns.  This could have been tolerable it the dungines had different looking rooms. They don't. They graphics aren't what you would call a second generation.  They would have been more impresive if this game came out when the PS2 first came out.  Zelda is so much better because Zelda had so much more to do than just dungine crawling. It had a bunch of secret things and mini games, and it had a big world for you to explore. Dark Cloud has none of that.  There isn't even an overworld or whatever you call it.  You just go straight to the towns.  And in each town, you have to find the stupid pieces and rebuild the towns, then repeat the process.  Now, for the combat.  It's totally like Zelda, except you constantly have to go and buy repair powder because guess what, your weapons have a ceratain amount of hits before the break and disappear.  Also, you constantly have to go and drink water because you get thristy.  Sure, it's realistc, but we get games to escape to a fantasy, to do things we can't do, and to have fun.  You want thrist?  Go run 20 miles non-stop.  The characters don't look unique at all.  The main character looks like Link except for the hat.  And the flying god looks like the flying dog from the Neverending Story, if you've ever seen that movie.  This game was interesting for the first 30 minutes, but when I saw what you basically have to do for the rest of the game, it got old pretty quickly.  I suggest you rent the game before you see if you can look past all these cons.	-1
"Zelda Killer?" Only if that means copying Zelda in every way imaginable can make it superior. "A league of its own?" Not exactly, file this one with Legend of Dragoon as a predictably unoriginal, mediocre RPG. If you're looking for that game that will pick up this slump of good software for the PS2, you'll have to wait even longer. Now let me clarify this: I have not played Zelda 64 nor do I own a N64. I did not hear about how this was going to be a copycat of Zelda until I finished reading someone else's review a few minutes ago. That said, I still felt like I was playing a rather effortlessly made copy of it. For sheer curiosity, I tried Zelda at a friend's house. Even the grunts Link makes in-battle seems to be stolen from this game. What is the gameplay like? For "Zelda-virgins" such as myself, it was pretty good at first. It was easy to jump into, and hard to put down for the first 5 hours or so. Good, until, after quite some time in the game, nothing really happens in the storyline (a Sony RPG trademark) and after hours upon hours of repetitive gameplay (yet another Sony RPG trademark), it failed to keep me within its grasps. The graphics, while good, are nothing spectacular. They quickly get tiresome when you're in the same dungeon for 5 hours or more. Every level of the dungeons look the same, so if you have a high tolerance of environments as repetetive as the gameplay, you'll have no trouble there. And here's another staple, the immense amount of typing errors, the third sign of a Sony RPG. While there isn't much text, it was enough to make me want to send money to Sony to buy a spell checker for the sake of pity. Georama is almost innovative. It would be if Sim-City hadn't done this general idea first, and if it gave you more freedom. The villagers are very picky as to where their house should be placed. So picky that you'll wonder why Sony even bothered to let you build these villages at all. In general, buy this if you liked "Legend of Dragoon" or if you've never even heard of the Zelda series.	-1
I cannot believe how high a rating this game is getting. This supposed "Zelda killer" is nothing more than a dungeon crawl along the lines of Evolution on Dreamcast. Zelda tramples this bore into the dirt. It's got many similarities to Evolution: randomized dungeon levels, repeat visits back to town to restock on supplies so you can go back to the dungeon, bland enemies, that feeling of inane repetition. As for combat, where's the strategy? Where're the backflips, the dodges, the ability to take out an enemy in more than two fashions, the feeling that you're actually in the middle of a fight instead pressing one button a lot? Basically, you either combo them to death, or you use your charge up super move. Dungeons are bland. Basically, it's a bunch of rooms connected by tunnels. There are no puzzles or unique obstacles that have to be dealt with. There's no sense of discovery, no "Aha!" moments that are the great moments of Zelda style games. Every dungeon just feels like a dungeon. You're not discovering whole new worlds filled with nooks, crannies, and secrets waiting to be found, you're dungeon crawling, looking for loot and the key to the next level so you can do it all over again. Gameplay is repetitive. Venture to the dungeon, find the mystic balls and key, go back to town, build (which does have a minor appeal to it) and get supplies (did I mention your character has to have a drink of water every three minutes? Or that his weapon starts to wear down and break after killing five or six enemies?), venture to the dungeon and find mystic balls on the next level which looks exactly the same as the first. Ugh, ugh, ugh!	-1
I think this game has gotten good reviews.  I don't see the appeal.  It is just a castle defense game.  Nothing really special about it.	-1
I hated the fact that you had to pass the damn license test before you could even race. Takes away the fun from doing what's really fun in the game...racing. There's a point where realism can stretch a bit too far...I know it would be realistic to have the liscense tests in there, as you would have to take them in real life. However, they are annoying and stupid and better off not being there in a game, something meant to entertain you, not bore and frustrate you to death. Also, there are the simulation of the handling and controls...my bro says it's for people who know how to drive well. Well, for the rest of us, could they not have implemented arcade style handling and controls? It would have been such an easy thing to implement, and I know it's not realistic, but it would draw more people to play the game that wouldn't otherwise. Finally, there is the fact that you can't crash, wreck or damage your car in any way, shape or form. This is supposed to be the most realistic driving simulation, yet I can hit a wall at 200 mph and just bounce off it and all that happens is that I slow down, maybe spin out or get turned around. Supposedly this is because the car companies that liscensed their cars for use in the game didn't want to see their precious pretty cars get smashed up in a freaking game. So it was either take damage out, or the game would've never been released in its current form. The only thing that could have given this an extra star is the occasional fun you have racing against your friends, but sadly it isn't enough.	-1
This game is great if you have 12 or so hrs to spend getting your Drivers lic. There are a total of 42 test you must pass to get all 6 drivers lic. Infact, I wouldn't be suprised if it takes someone 24 hrs to pass them all. Shouldn't these test be optional? They could award cash or the best cars after finishing each lic test. But they make you go through this [garbage] of taking these useless test. I'm on the last test of my B lic. I spend nearly 5 hrs total. I doubt I will pass it. Sorry, but that is not fun!! I love a challenge but the developers made the test way to difficult..	-1
The graphics are stupendous. The images are great. The detail is fantastic. But it isn't any fun to play. The reason for this is GT3's overburdensome menu system. You spend so much time tweaking your cars and going through the tremendous amount of menus and sub menus in order to qualify or enter a race, that the whole process kills the fun of the game. GT3 is basically GT2 with superior graphics. The courses are the same...just better looking. Qualifiying for licenses is also a big chore. While it was fun during the first two GT's, this third one is just another step that removes you from the action of racing. The experience is frustrating. I had high hopes for GT3, but it fell way short of being entertaining. If a racing game prevents you from racing, then what is the point? The game is beautiful graphically. There is no doubt about this. However, the game is pure frustration because you do more menu navigating then actual racing. If racing is your interest, check out WipeOut Fusion as an alternative.	-1
Did not switch game input to RF out.  I ended up cutting the leads of and creating a temporary adapter cable.	-1
This is a disgrace to racing and all car games in general... to bad such a powerful system does not have games like Metropolis street racing on the dreamcast.  Dont buy this game... it is horrible!	-1
I don't really understand why this game got so much hype really.  It's nothing special.  There really isn't anything great about this game.	-1
Grand Turismo is the best racing game on earth. The cars are exactly like the real thing. The reflections onto the car are very realistic as if you were driving it for real. The creators of the game made the speed, handling, acceleration and braking exactly as it would be in real life. they have millions of cars in the game like my pesonal favorite the viper GTS. like the first one the drivers test part is complicated. This time there is a line for the drivers test part that tells you what to do with the diferent coloring of the line. They have these new tracks for of road races. The tracks are somewhat complicated yet fun. So if you're a racing game freak then you'll love this game.	-1
I just want to say that this is a racing game if u haven't already figured that out. If u like ur games to have a little more substance then u won't like this. I will admit that the built-in rumble feature on the controller really adds to the realism. It is very realistic, like when you get hit or go across a bumpy dirt road, you feel every hit and feel every bump, but that's basically the only thing it has going for it.	-1
If you like advertisements at every turn, on every vehicle, in allmost every song played and know how to for real really race a car down a buteiful looping course with cutt out cardboard fans. Then for all means purchase this game, I'll use it for charcol to barbaque some nicely portion pieces of slaughtered cow.	-1
This is not a game. It is a soap opera with dialogue taking up all of the game playing time. Granted, it is very well done, but I am at chapter 6 wondering if I have the patience to continue on through with the overly repetitive nature of the "talking THREADS" required in order to proceed to the next 'scene'. This is really a movie, with the pretense of being an interactive game. Granted, it is a well-done computer mouse click movie, but why pretend it is a game? To be fair, I am male, so nonstop chatting about everything I see is not something that entertains me. I guess this is a 'chick flick' sort of ?game?. If you love to hear people blather on and on and on and on and on and on and on ad nauseum with nothing happening in between, this is for you. If you insist on playing, do yourself a favor and turn on subtitles. That way you can speed read and right mouse click past the flood of mindless chatter. I feel like giving this one star due to the absolutely ridiculous amount of dialogue one must plod through (fully 99% of the 'pretend game' play) but I will be generous and give it 1 extra star for at least being creative. But I still insist this is NOT really a game, but a movie. I give this the "Black Dahlia" award, given to the game that wastes so much time on plot and chat threads that one gets eventually frustrated and quits playing because there is really nothing for the "player" to do other than listen to dialogue. What a shame we must even spend the energy to "click" to hear the next sentence.	-1
This "game" hardly felt like a game. It's more like a walkthrough movie. Check that. It's more like a mediocre walkthrough novel, replete with unentrhalling dialogue and silly, ridiculous puzzles. The storyline is inventive and interesting, and it could have been a masterpiece, but the script writing and voice acting are so dreadful that it is very difficult to even care what's going to happen at the end. When I say that the voice acting is bad, I don't mean it's the ordinary "bad" for a computer game, I mean that it's pitiful, even for a computer game. The main character speaks all of her lines like a six year old child from Sesame Street. This looks extra absurd with all of the profanity in the game (who wrote this script -- Eddie Murphy?).  I can't believe how much profanity there was in this game.  It doesn't fit in at all.  Imagine the Teletubbies saying the "f" word to each other constantly, and you will have a feel for what the dialog of this game is like. More than half of the puzzles have no logic whatsoever to them. This is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the game. Some of the solutions are terribly obvious, and others make no sense whatsoever.  This game suffers pretty badly from the "you can't solve puzzle A until you have talked to person B about problem C" disease that strikes bad puzzle games. It also has a lot of puzzles where you only have to keep clicking on the 8 items in your inventory until you guess the right one. Good puzzles are the key to a good puzzle game. This one has very few. As far as graphics and sound go? Sound is very good, and so is the music. The graphics and animation are VERY mediocre, and I think that I am being complementary.  I can't believe all of the reviews that are saying what great graphics this game has.  Give me a break!! On almost every screen, you are a small figure in a big environment, with only about two or three little things to look at or interact with. It might have been good three or four years ago, but it is subpar compared to the superb environments created in games nowadays like Thief and Deus Ex. "The Longest Journey" should have been a novel. It was a disappointment as a game.	-1
It was ok.	-1
This game is so great it doesn't have 2 player.... That's how awesome it is. I hate Mario games. Mario 2 to me at least is the best one. Where peach can hover an luigi jumps all high.	-1
This is the dumbest mega man title yet. I was floored when i saw the game and first played it, but when i saw that there were no bosses and no charge shot, i felt betrayed. i did finish the game as i did not want to lose the money, just a big let down.	-1
This light stinks. you barely get anything out of it and it wastes your batteries.	-1
The Wormlight sounds good, doesn't it? "You can play your Game Boy Color in the Dark! Isn't that cool!" Yes, my friends, it is cool. That is, if it didn't use your GBA's batteries. No big deal, you say? What would your impression be if a drunk came up to your door and freeloaded off you for the rest of your life? There. Now that we share the same point of view, DO NOT BUY THIS LIGHT. IT WILL DESTROY YOUR BATTERIES' LIFE, AND TRUST ME YOU DON'T WANT THAT.	-1
I bought this memory card and was sorely dissappointed. The salesperson told me that the Sony brand ones (which were out of stock) were better, and I dismissed it as a Pro-Sony sales pitch. I shoulda listened. This card "lost" three weeks worth of saved games and data.  The company offered to replace it for free >if they find it to be defective<. Since it appears that the card only reformatted itself I can't see them replacing it, because "technically" it works. Too bad they can't recover all the hours of lost gameplay. I'm sticking with Sony cards from now on.... I've been burned by third party cards one time too many.	-1
This is a lousy product, period!  I purchased one of these cheaper memory cards and it worked for a month.  I had the pleasure of the memory card breaking when I was over halfway through Oni on the PS2 (you will have to have played ONI to know how upset I was because Oni is a really frustrating game).  Needless to say, I went out to purchase a memory card made by Sony after I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Sony Technical Support.  Oh by the way, Sony said to me that the 3rd party DVD remotes are not endorsed by Sony and they could potentially cause problems with the PS2 console, so I ditched the 3rd party remote I had too. Save yourself the time and money and just pay the few extra dollars for a memory card that is endorsed and manufactured by Sony.  That way you won't have to spend hour after hour of sleepless nights just to get back to where you were in the game you were playing because you had one of these cheap memory cards and it crapped out on you right at the middle of the game.	-1
i bought this memory card yesterday. i took it home and popped it in.it did not work it was broken. took it back and got another one and it was broken.so i got the sony one and it works fine. i mean don't get me wrong the shipment could have been knocked around but 2 out of 2 broken???? my friend has one and a sony one. it seems that the sony one loads twice as fast as this one and its easier to get out of the playstation. this one is a little tight in the console. so just because its 5 dollars less don't think it is just as good. if you ask me i would spend the extra five bucks and get a memory card that will work when you need it to.thanx alot and happy gameing outhere.	-1
I have big feet.  This does not work well at all with my feet.  If i put my heel in the cup, the middle of my arch is at the edge of the pedal.  Due to the heel cups, I cannot toe the pedals easily either.  Also, the pedals are a little close together to be useful.  I basically opened them, tried them for 3 days, and put them on a shelf since then.	-1
Dropping this to a 2/5.  I'd fist like to say I LOVE CH Products, the fighter stick is amazing and love the throttle especially the little mini mouse nipple.  These though are another story, yes they are very reliable but VERY narrow, not only that but I recently upgraded to X99 motherboard and these peddles started giving me endless hassles with weird Q-code on X99 POST (using Asus Extreme V motherboard).  X99 don't play well with very old USB products and there is something up with this products USB implementation.  Its really time they refresh their excellent product line.  I really want it to be a bit more comfortable to use too.  So I won't easily recommend these unless the refresh the line.  EDIT (3/23/16):  Going to dust mine off again once Rift VR gets released for use with Elite Dangerous.  The mod mention in the comments to my review looks interesting; I may make one for myself too.  I had made a mod before using wood, but the linked EzeMod Mk II looks like a better design.  My main issue is the peddles are too close to each other and the angle hurts the bridge of my feet after LONG periods of use.  Also regarding my USB issues, I think it was specific to my MB and I started using X99 pretty early, probably a newer MB BIOS will fix my issue, but since I had added an additional USB card I am not messing with my BIOS.  Sorry leaving my review at 2/5, this is just my perspective.  If it was a 4/5 or 5/5 product mine would not be sitting in the garage collecting dust but be under my desk IMO.	-1
PS2 networks are no longer available.	-1
out dated don't no if works but any one can try I never try to get online plus don't have any games that are online got this so I could you 40 gb hard drive for storing games	-1
This should basically be for a collector only because the Network is gone. I can't do anything with this product online at all. Sony is kind of bogus for shutting down the servers for the PS2 network because it would be fun to still be able to go on line and play with other gamers. Some one else should get something going again so this item is useable.	-1
The online adaptor works great with any online game that came out before 2004.  DSL is not compatible with this adaptor on ALL games created after 2004.  Do not fall for these other reviews.  I have DSL and I was able to play Madden 2004 online, but Madden 2005 IS NOT COMPATIBLE, I called EA Sports and a recording tells you DSL is not compatible with ANY EA games sold after 2004.  I tried calling my ISP as well as Sony but found absolutely no tech support on this subject.  How can you have 10 million users who have DSL and possibly make games that are not compatible with DSL I ask you?  Sony found a way.  Oh and don't think you'll be able to play SOCOM II online with DSL either, I repeat all newer games  will not work with DSL.  Don't get me wrong, I love the PS2, but man did they drop the ball with the online adaptor!!!	-1
This product for the PS2 that enables you to play online is an absolute rip. I have pleanty of reasons but let me give you the jist of it. Now see first of the price of the adapter alone is pleanty enough to put someone down. Hell I love online gaming but 40 some bucks taken out of my pocket to do it is a little too much. The adapter is fine within itself. The problem I have with it, is just the online capabilities. Now first off installing and connecting the adapter to your PS2 (...)takes way to much time. Another thing is the booklet which they give you and expect you to read it is like a chapter book not a manuel. In order to start playing you must put the disc in which is given within the package and sit through a long tidius process. It is not as simple as to plug it in and play instead they had to create a long difficult process.  Another problem with this product is the capabilities with the games. First of the games are very limited...From that I mean the choice in which one has to play from. Eventually I know more games will come out...But eventually PS3 will come out won't it? Nevertheless for the games that are compatiable with this adapter the connectivity servers suck ass!! Playing from several of my friends house and my own the lagging and time it takes to enter a game is extensive and overstrenuius. There are pleanty more things wrong with this including hidden fees with cables (not included in package) the games and routers (Which I needed). I spent in total around $200 in high hopes of playing online. Instead I had the enjoyment of staring into the menu screen of the PS2. If your smart you'll spend your money on something else you want instead of this POS. By any means necessary stay away from this product!!	-1
The most important question concerning this product is, does it work?  The answer is yes and no. When I first got it and connected it to my cable modem, the setup disk work perfectly and I was on in minutes.  Sweet! Then I tried to set it with my router.  I used the Linksys BEFSR41 router, probably the most ubiquitous router in the home market.  Due to it's monopoly, I was also using the largest broadband provider - Comcast (Oh I how I hate them).  So, in terms of home networking, it's the most standard setup around.  Anyway, I setup the router to work, and tested it with my Windows 98 machine.  That's right, the router and cable modem worked with 6 year old technology.  Yet the setup disk for this brand new network adapter did not recognize the connection.  It's a simple DHCP connection that really should not pose any problems, but it does. I searched the web for a little while, but I could not find the right settings.  The Sony website is absolutely useless.  To get my PS2 online, I'm now forced to move my cable modem to my living room, and I cannot have my computer and PS2 connected at the same time.  Sony should have tested it better.	-1
Before spending the tremendous amount of money on this game system, I hope you take this review into consideration.  As both a DC (dreamcast) and PS2 (playstation 2) owner, I have had the opportunity to critically review each system, and thus I want to share these observations with you.  In turn, this review points out the good and the bad of each system, and in the end I will tell you the winning system; so here we go:  Hardware: OK, when looking at the PS2's specs on paper compared the DC's, the DC doesnt look good.  I won't go into the detail, but I have to say that the PS2 system looks more capable.  But then again, what good is a great system, when the system doesn't play great games?  The games on the PS2 are just not as good as the comparable games on the DC. I'll go into that more in a little while.  But either way, in raw specs, the winner is the PS2.  Graphics: many people base their gaming experience purely on graphics, and true, it is very important.  Having lush 3d graphics is critical to games today, and the DC and PS2 prove that.  The DC shows this in games that peak in game graphics.  For instance, hands down, reviewers from ... and people believe that the fighting game Soul Calibur has the greatest graphics in any fighting game ever.  The level of detail in the game Shenmue is also astounding.  The PS2 also has some great graphics, but they just aren't as good as the dreamcast.  This is surprising as Sony reprsentitaves said that the system would produce graphics that make the Dreamcast seem outdated.  Game reviewers also feel that the graphics are not on par with the dreamcast.  Many have criticized the jaggy lines that are produced from the PS2.  I definately noticed this when playing Ridge racer V.  It's not that the graphics are bad, it's just that with all the hype that was said about the PS2's AMAZING graphics, it truly doesn't turn out those results.  Of course, the Playstation2 is a new system, and many of the GREAT games are yet to come.  But then again, Soul Calibur came out at the start of the DC's release.  Thus, the dreamcast wins in this area over the PS2.   Sound:  the winner of this section is so hard to say.  It really is hard to say.  It depends on the game and also your TV.  Because of this, they both are equal.   Games: another very hard section to review.  Naturally, the DC is the clear winner.  I has been out longer, and thus has had time to produce ASTONISHING games that have REVOLUTIONIZED the gaming world.  The PS2 has just been released, and the system does have same pretty darn good games.  But they just don't compare the DC's comparable games.  This idea is unanamous between all professional reviewers. In sports, the DC rocks with NFL 2k1, Soul Calibur is the most accaladed game ever made, Shenmue was the most expensive game made and is also the most detailed, etc.  The DC is the clear winner, and will be for A LONG time until the PS2 can come up with some games that are in the same league as the DC.   Features: so, you like the DVD player on the PS2?  Or the modem on the DC?  What system excells in features where the other does not?  Well, the DVD player on the PS2 is a great feature.  But it also has many downsides.  First of all, is it really great to play DVD's on a regular, sub-average TV with no surround sound, which is what most people own?  NO.  That is what your credit card will say to you when you buy all your new DVD's along with your tremendously high system.  But, if you have the money and the equipment, this is a great feature.  Another downside of the PS2 is that the system is not capable of holding 4 controlers, you have to buy yet another product to do so.  Annoing, isn't it?  The PS2 will have a broadband modem in about 2 years.  Ask yourself something: what good is a modem on your PS2 when you'll be playing some new and better system then?  2 years is a long time to wait for that modem, and it really is important.  The other accessories, like rumble packs, memory cards, etc, are good.  The DC has a built in modem that allows you to surf the net, play your video games, send e-mail....all for free!  Playing video games online is truly an amazing feature, and is worthwile if there are no friends over at your house.  Unfortanately, there are only a handful of games utilizing this technology, but MANY more are on the way.  The DC also has 4 controler slots, plays CD's, etc.  It doesn't have the DVD player, though, and also has some terrible add-on products like some of the rumble packs you can purchase. The winner of this category is the DC, because it's more capable of it's technology NOW, and also doesn't require other expensive stuff like a great TV and surround sound to utilize it's features.  So who is the winner at the end?  The clear winner is the DC!  Yes, the DC.  It has been out longer so it has things the PS2 does not, and also is packed with amazing games and graphics that just plain and simply beat out the PS2.  Also check out the price tag: it's half the price of the PS2.  Look, the PS2 does have good qualities, but the hype and biased opinions made the system something it's not.  That's why I gave it 2 stars.  It does have some great games and the DVD player is neat, so it does deserve some credit.  But trust me when I say go get a DC, not a PS2, its definately worth it and you can spend the extra money you didn't use for some more great games.  ( and no I DO NOT work for sega :))	-1
I bought this game based on the enthusiastic reviews below, and now I have to wonder what these people were thinking.  "Sea Dogs" is indeed 3 games in one.  However, none of them is particularly complelling.  They consist of: 1.  A roleplaying game, which consists of walking around and asking people things.  However you generally ask each person one thing, and they give you one response, so there's not much room for thinking. 2.  A naval simulator, which is mildly interesting for the first couple of fights.  However, since every fight is basically the same, this quickly becomes boring-- endlessly sailing in circles and lining up broadsides against your opponents. 3.  A video game style fencing sequence that is simply annoying.  It's ridiculously primitive compared to the martial arts style games on the market, and one has to wonder why it's even in here. Over all, there was nothing particularly compelling about the game play.  The graphics are pretty, but how long can you stare at the waves and the storm clouds when the game itself is dry as toast?  Also, the game is SERIOUSLY buggy, even with the new 1.4 patch installed and running.  The game is completely incompatible with a number of video cards.  So if you do buy the game, there's a modest chance that it simply won't run on your machine.	-1
This game is the absolute worst Pirate game ever. It completely lacks the fun factor of Sid Meiers Pirates!, or the polish of any many of the top quality games. This is headed for the bargin bin soon. It has typical Bethesda Softworks graphics bugs and other game crashing bugs. Ship control is horrid. Game play is non-existent. The interface is a cludge.  The sound is good and the graphics are "ok".  Brilliant in spots, and simply ugly in others.  There are quite a few graphics bugs.  Even with patch 1.06 (released 04/2001). No matter how well you pound an enemy ship, they will never strike.  You must board (almost impossible).  And then defeat the enemy captain in a duel.  This duel is limited to a couple of crude keyboard strokes.  And in the first 12+ I tried, I lost all 12+.  Oh what fun.  So I had the joy of reloading the start postion a dozen times and experimenting with several different  There is absolutely no game balance.  There is no way to scale down the difficulty level.  In about 75% of the opening games, I was attacked by 3 spanish ships (you always start with the Spanish as your enemy).  No matter how much of their sails you shoot out with chain shot, they remain always faster and more maneuverable then you.  Your ship has 3 cannons facing rearward for when you flee.  I used those liberally for hours (real time) and was in the end caught and killed. (repeatedly).  This is a Simply STUPID way to begin the game. If you simply must own all sailing or pirate games get it.  I tried to give it to a buddy I went to college with, and after trying it he gave back.  Even free, it was over priced.	-1

Graphics: many people base their gaming experience purely on graphics, and true, it is very important. Having lush 3d graphics is critical to games today, and the DC and PS2 prove that. The DC shows this in games that peak in game graphics. For instance, hands down, reviewers from ... and people believe that the fighting game Soul Calibur has the greatest graphics in any fighting game ever. The level of detail in the game Shenmue is also astounding. The PS2 also has some great graphics, but they just aren't as good as the dreamcast. This is surprising as Sony reprsentitaves said that the system would produce graphics that make the Dreamcast seem outdated. Game reviewers also feel that the graphics are not on par with the dreamcast. Many have criticized the jaggy lines that are produced from the PS2. I definately noticed this when playing Ridge racer V. It's not that the graphics are bad, it's just that with all the hype that was said about the PS2's AMAZING graphics, it truly doesn't turn out those results. Of course, the Playstation2 is a new system, and many of the GREAT games are yet to come. But then again, Soul Calibur came out at the start of the DC's release. Thus, the dreamcast wins in this area over the PS2. Sound: the winner of this section is so hard to say. It really is hard to say. It depends on the game and also your TV. Because of this, they both are equal. Games: another very hard section to review. Naturally, the DC is the clear winner. I has been out longer, and thus has had time to produce ASTONISHING games that have REVOLUTIONIZED the gaming world. The PS2 has just been released, and the system does have same pretty darn good games. But they just don't compare the DC's comparable games. This idea is unanamous between all professional reviewers. In sports, the DC rocks with NFL 2k1, Soul Calibur is the most accaladed game ever made, Shenmue was the most expensive game made and is also the most detailed, etc. The DC is the clear winner, and will be for A LONG time until the PS2 can come up with some games that are in the same league as the DC. Features: so, you like the DVD player on the PS2? Or the modem on the DC? What system excells in features where the other does not? Well, the DVD player on the PS2 is a great feature. But it also has many downsides. First of all, is it really great to play DVD's on a regular, sub-average TV with no surround sound, which is what most people own? NO. That is what your credit card will say to you when you buy all your new DVD's along with your tremendously high system. But, if you have the money and the equipment, this is a great feature. Another downside of the PS2 is that the system is not capable of holding 4 controlers, you have to buy yet another product to do so. Annoing, isn't it? The PS2 will have a broadband modem in about 2 years. Ask yourself something: what good is a modem on your PS2 when you'll be playing some new and better system then? 2 years is a long time to wait for that modem, and it really is important. The other accessories, like rumble packs, memory cards, etc, are good. The DC has a built in modem that allows you to surf the net, play your video games, send e-mail....all for free! Playing video games online is truly an amazing feature, and is worthwile if there are no friends over at your house. Unfortanately, there are only a handful of games utilizing this technology, but MANY more are on the way. The DC also has 4 controler slots, plays CD's, etc. It doesn't have the DVD player, though, and also has some terrible add-on products like some of the rumble packs you can purchase. The winner of this category is the DC, because it's more capable of it's technology NOW, and also doesn't require other expensive stuff like a great TV and surround sound to utilize it's features. So who is the winner at the end? The clear winner is the DC! Yes, the DC. It has been out longer so it has things the PS2 does not, and also is packed with amazing games and graphics that just plain and simply beat out the PS2. Also check out the price tag: it's half the price of the PS2. Look, the PS2 does have good qualities, but the hype and biased opinions made the system something it's not. That's why I gave it 2 stars. It does have some great games and the DVD player is neat, so it does deserve some credit. But trust me when I say go get a DC, not a PS2, its definately worth it and you can spend the extra money you didn't use for some more great games. ( and no I DO NOT work for sega :))	-1
First of all, why the HELL is this thing $15 dollars PLUS tax. I have PlayStation2, and I don't generally like it. I thought Microsoft was trying to steal your money, but now this PIECE OF GARBAGE comes along and it is a JOKE. Why is Amazon selling this for $15 dollars. i got mine with my PlayStation2 and now they are selling it just to keep space. This is a total joke.  ..........Now that I have cooled down, this can be space saving. If it was free, well, it would be a good buy. PlayStation2 is not THAT big, and if you don't have enough space 1)Your poor and can only put everything in one room or 2)You have those TV's which have a million plugs. That is why it gets at least two stars, because nothing is THAT bad, (well...some games and equipment have gone over the edge).  So, instead of wasting $15 dollars, go out and save up for some games. The blue color is not impressive, and it doesn't cool down and it doesn't scratch your discs. Actually, it only does one thing, wastes your money.	-1
This game is very frustrating I used to play it on the original sega genesis and It was not very fun. My brother almost beat this game however if you want to play this game the mega sonic collection plus has this game it's still frustrating.	-1
Why spend [money] on something that does NOTHING for you except possibly make your PS2 look better.  The PS2 is in no danger of falling over when it in horizontal, so whats the point of putting it verticle, now you controller ports detract from the look even more than having it horizontal.  Spend this [money] towards a new game.	-1
Utter waste of cash right here. you pay twice the price of the sony cable for a cable that 1) has no audio output 2) tends to be way too loose of a connection when plugged into the ps2 3) has a lot of advance shielding that does absolutely nothing (yes I have done extensive testing on it. neither sony nor monster gets interference for the most part, but when you do hit those high levels, BOTH cables get interference just as bad) Monster is nothing but a name that people seem to be way too willing to pay for.  their products are decent but by no means high quality. save the cash and get the official Sony cable instead.	-1
Maybe Im just a rock but how are you supposed to connect your system to both a TV and a audio reciever/decoder? There is not enough play in the end to allow the video cable to go to the TV and the audio cables to go to my sound system. So after trying to slice the individual cables apart with my kbar I finally gave up and just used regular AV cables.	-1
The cable does offer superior picture and sound quality as the product claims. There is a flaw with the cable however. For almost [money] you would expect a better connector from the cable to the PS2 system. The monster cable connector is not quite a tight enough fit which causes it to make a bad contact. The symptoms you might get are flickering on the screen and slight loss in sound or sound quality before the connection is lost without warning while playing. Not only is this annoying but it is also frustrating when you hit a tense spot in a game and then have to pause it to correct the problem. I would have expected a lot more for my money! I should mention that my PS2 is ALWAYS stationary and is not moving at all when the connection is lost. This situation while aggrivating, is not all that bad but I would recommend a different cable for anyone who has all of their A/V equipment jammed in a cabinet and cannot get to the connectors easily.	-1
Control is absolutely horrible.  I do surf and have for 15+ years.  The control on this game makes it worthless in my opinion....	-1
When i went to the store i had no intention of buying thisgame. However, surrounded by ... games i found this game for ... I figured if it is priced ... less it can't be great but hey, i like surfing it cant be that bad, can it? Well yes, it can. Surfing H30 just plain ... The game is hard to master, and has horrible controls. WHy would you have to press the R3 button down to stand up? They don't take advantage of the PS2 control which can handle more than the anolog and R buttons. Also, the camera angles are horrible. Whenever you turn the angle switches, i almost ... my food let alone my money. This game is made by an ameteur company who has no right producing a game at this point. Get some more experience before you try and come out with an enticing ps2 game. Bottom line if you see this game with a bargain price tag, pretend it just isn't there.	-1
Well here we are..H30!1 YEAH wait um, how the.?. why?oops (wipe out)  That is what you will be saying when you play thisgame.  Then after about 30 minutes you will throw your controller down and curse Sony for putting out a game like this .  I (a surfer) was all excited to see this game come out, but was very dissapointed the controls are just hmmm hwo to say this nicely STUPID.  THe bottom lineis save your money.  Hopefully they will put a game out that is easierto control.  the graphics are cool, and the idea of the game is great,but the ... controls just are horrible.  Rent it first see what you think.	-1
I bought this cable to hook up my Playstation 2 with a Promedia DD-5.1 (Digital Decoder). The Problem is that the cable I bought didn't produce 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS, just stereo. Read the reviews for the X-box Lightwave 100 cable; they are the same cable except for the color. Some people maybe haven't figured it out yet because they don't use a Digital Decoder, but all they are hearing is Stereo sound. Im pretty upset because I sent my Digital Decoder back to Klipsch thinking that was the problem, but it was actually the cable. By the way the customer service at Klipsch is simply the best, they produced high quality equipment, not like over at monster cable. So beware! If you are paying big $ for a cable shouldn't it at least work or do what it say it does?	-1
Honestly the cables that come with the system are fine. I wasted money on this one.	-1
Surfing H30 has all the workings of a good game. Rockstar Games has the PS2 graphics engine down pat, as they have shown with Midnight Club Street Racing, and now Surfing H30. H30's water effects are the best I have seen since Wave Race 64 for the N64.  The music is a few alternative tracks, which works well with this game.  The problem with H30, is the somewhat difficult control, and the lack of Variety. After surfing a few levels with various surfers, I was impressed with the graphics but I really didn't feel like there was a need to play this again.  There is little, to no variety in each level, and this makes it pretty tough for an individual to keep playing a game. This game could have worked better if it was packed in with additional watersports, such as jet skiing, water skiing etc. Unfortunately it was not. Bottomline, if you have to have a surfing title in your collection, Surfing H30 is your only choice.  The lack of variety, and difficult control will have you using this disc as a drink coaster in a short period of time. I'd recommend renting this game, but I would not purchase it.	-1
Although it has 10 workable buttons which come in handy for some games, it has some major flaws. On some games, if you press Up on the gamepad you go Down, and when you press Down you'll go up. The directional pad is totally useless, games where you need to move the D-pad rapidly, forget about it!! The buttons in the back eventually get stuck. You can't use any other Gravis controller while this one is in use. And on top of all that, not even the uninstaller works right. When you goto uninstall the controller, it screws up your computers registry files. It was a nightmare just to get my computer working again. I'll never buy another Gravis gamepad again.	-1
Who said this was scary? Must've been a real whoosie... The game is awkward in it's controls and it's annoying trying to recharge. The graphics are good, but scary? C'mon... If you think this is scary you must've led a sheltered life... I love exciting games and this one bored me... I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone who has a short attention span...	-1
The graphics are pretty good.  The controls are o.k.  However -The mission objectives are unclear.  The mech customization is limited.  The missions become difficult quickly.  The background dialog is annoying.  Weapon and special equipment specs are not spelled out.  I quit playing after the fourth mission and I don't think I will ever pick it up again.	-1
Take a look at the date of my review, because as of this date, many magazines and websites have claimed that Anarchy Online has fixed most of its problems.  HOWEVER, I just joined the game, and am unable to play for longer than 5 minutes without getting kicked off.  Yet I still play.  And I still get kicked off.  Over and over. It is a shame that a game this much fun is so difficult to play.  I will tell you that I witnessed many other players who didn't seem to have any difficulties at all playing, so maybe you might not either...  But it is still a gamble... Bugs aside, this game is brilliant.  Brilliant in a thousand little ways that only a massive online RPG can be.  I know because I've played the other games before, and I can see how AO has reduced the repedativeness and boredom of some of these other games.  Custom missions give players their own private dungeons, so they can play without competition for loot.  Apartment buildings give every player their own space, right off the bat.  Various transportation networks give different professions different abilities to travel, and 3 major factions have split the world apart such that one character will never be able to see everything.  Add to this little things like built in scripts, macros, reduced healing time, blah blah blah, if you don't know what I'm talking about, just take my word for it, AO is the best online -game- there is, if it only weren't hampered by its bugs.  Veteran players, most of the requests I've seen for other MMORPGs are in AO, in some form or another.  Check it out, but at your own risk.	-1
Anarchy Online invaded my life for several months, unfortunately.  It was my first MMORPG so this game took me by storm at first, and exploring the beautiful world of Rubi-Ka was a long venture in and of itself. The skill system is great, combat is genuinely suspenseful and fun for the most part, and the people in-game were helpful and mature most of the time. But ultimately AO became nothing more than some idle chat with others and running on the leveling treadmill.  I would go to a mission booth, run to mission cave, finish it, go to shop, wash, rinse and repeat.  It can take a couple of hours early on to level up, and as it goes on it can take several hours at a time.  I felt like I was getting nowhere and the missions were incredibly repetitive and dull.  All of them looked the same and behaved the same, and you always fought the same handful of creatures or people. To add to the frustration Funcom constantly tinkered with the game's balance, almost literally ruining the game with one patch, it created so many new bugs and problems people jumped ship big time. I joined a guild which was nothing more than a private shopping chat channel and team matchmaker.  PVP action is filled with no-lifers who "tweak" their characters with the help of higher level players and "implants," and Funcom has let this go on since the beginning. The game is repetitive, frustrating, buggy still, and has the worst lag of any online game I've ever played, that alone was enough to make me quit. I wanted to like the game and make it a long-term habit, but the game wouldn't let me. And judging from the new "ideas" being considered for the game this summer, I don't see any hope for this game at all.	-1
I honestly wanted to give Anarchy Online a chance. The massively multiplayer genre needs some new blood, and there were some interesting things in this game when it first went live: good graphics, promising character classes, and a sci-fi setting (though really not very 'hard' sci-fi, more like fantasy with some 'futuristic' touches). However, the developer, Funcom, has demonstrated truly astonishing incompetence and bad faith since the launch of the game. All games of this kind have rocky launches, but don't be fooled: the problems of Anarchy Online go far deeper than a rocky launch. Each patch has actually introduced serious new balance problems and several, including the most recent patch, have reintroduced old bugs and added some new ones. These are not just garden-variety bugs, but game-stopping ones, mind you. Now Funcom has taken the extraordinary step of shutting down the support bulletin boards at its own site, which is always a sign of imminent disaster in the gaming world. It's the equivalent of a toxically bad film that a movie studio tries to keep away from critics hoping that they can just get one weekend of good box office before the word gets out. AO's European launch is imminent. If our good friends in Europe have any sense, they'll give this game a wide berth, whatever its price. The sooner Funcom closes the lights on the few remaining players in this flaming wreck of a game, the better. Perhaps they can sell the remnants of their tattered code to a real developer and someday we'll see the game reach its potential. It's a certainty that Funcom itself can't pull it off.	-1
I was in the beta...well...I never actually played in the beta because I could never get the game to work.  Then I was dumb enough to buy the game...lol.  After about a week of hair pulling, countless crashes to desktop, a few re installs, I actually got into the game and played..for about 10 minutes at a time or until I zoned and crashed to desktop.  But these problems are covered in other reviews, let's get to the real problems. 1.  BORING:  Once you get past all the bugs, (if you can), you find out what the game is really all about.  Well...not much.  One of the main selling points for this game, is that camping would be eliminated by the "random missions generators".  The key word here is RANDOM.  Everything about this game is random and generic, and that's it's biggest downfall.  There is no sense of purpose, no sense of direction, and no sense of accomplishment. The missions all start to look the same after about the 10th one, and you'll be on hundreds of them if you ever want any cash.  This also ties in to the lack of boss mobs, and lack of dungeons. You fight mostly outdoors, or in the "missions".  Which are randomly generated "dungeons".  The implementation of which is absolutely horrible.  Mobs are spawned with no ryhme or reason, some dungeons have ZERO mobs in them, some have 5 that will all rush you at zone it. 2.  SERIOUS coding and engine problems:  Not even going to go into all of these as they alone would take up the 1000 word limit on reviews, needless to say it's overwhelming. 3.  Crashing, crashing, and more crashing:  Self explainatory. 4.  Character creation:  Suppose to eliminate cookie cutter characters, but it doesn't.  Sure, you can train anything you want, but because of the skill system, and the way the points you get to spend must be distributed to make your character viable, you end up with really only one path you can take per given proffesion. 5.  Monster AI:  The single WORST programming of AI I have ever seen in any video game...and that's saying a lot. 6.  Exploits, cheats, hacks:  By the time I left, which was under one month into release, there were already players that were level 150+.  Being that this is a PvP game, that's not good.  Exploits were RAMPANT and numerous.  Exploiters went scott free. 7.  Balance of proffesions:  Non existant.  The game is so unbalanced it's not even funny.  There are 2 viable classes to play if you want to live PvP, forget it if you play any of the others. Just a note about me.  I'm an avid gamer, and have 3 characters over 50 in EQ, and 4 over 50 in AC.  So I obviously have the patience for online gaming...lol. This game fails in every single aspect of gameplay.  It's boring, repetitive, buggy, unbalanced, and just plain no fun.  Avoid at all costs, you have been warned.	-1
What is interesting about Anarchy Online is how much potential this game had. Great Graphics, a solid story line, and promises that players would be able to alter the course of the game's storyline all added up to an incredible dream for many gamers. The problem is, the game failed to deliver in most areas BESIDES graphics, leaving us with just another "interesting for a week" piece of software that will be popular only until the "Next Big MMORPG" comes around. If you like running out in a big field, clicking on a monster, killing it, clicking on another monster, killing it, clicking on another monster, etc, etc, etc... then this game is for you. If you're looking for an engrossing RPG, look somewhere else. One more important note: This game DOES contain "easter egg" nudity - that is, in certain extremely rare situations, you are able to see the genitals of some of the "avatars" in the game.	-1
And I give them one star for trying. The game really does LOOK good. And it seems like it would be a great game. But it is, at this point, almost completely unplayable. If you buy this game before they fix it (which could be months from now), here's what to expect: lag (VERY often) that can last longer than a minute, crashing to the desktop at least once an hour, computer lockups at least once every few hours, occasional inability to log in at all, items which do not work, missions which do not work, character death due to lag, and countless other minor and major bugs. I was actually very patient with these problems until the publisher lied to its customers. First, they told everyone the "free month" (your purchase price includes one month of online play) would not begin until the game was playable. Then, six days later, with almost no changes to the game, they declared it playable and began the billing cycle. To make matters worse, I can't even cancel my account. I'll probably have to dispute the charge with my bank. But at least I've already returned the game. Maybe I'll try again in a few months, but I don't really have a whole lot of faith or trust in Funcom right now.	-1
While Anarchy Online is an exciting new concept in online gaming that could replace the standard swords and sorcerors in the current "Big 3" online games (Asheron's Call, Ultima Online, Everquest), this game IS NOT READY to go online. Anarchy Online is another online game that was rumored to have been released before it was ready to help the cash-stretched company obtain quick income.  I played the Beta version up until the week before the game's release and while I was impressed with the sci-fi theme (and new online concepts such as everyone owning a house for their possessions) even with the smaller number of users in the Beta stage, the server(s) could not take the strains of running the game. In other words, if you purchase this game right now, you can expect huge lags (This is the game pausing because the internet connections aren't working properly.), resolution problems and other frustrating dilemmas.  These difficulties are even more frustrating when you consider that you're paying a monthly fee.  During the game's initial release, the company did not start charging accounts because of the problems but as I write this review, the company has decided to start charging accounts which has many current owners of the game angry as they have yet to experience a "working" game. It looks like a great concept for an online game, but the best bet would be to wait awhile and explore internet sources to find out the current state of the game.	-1
Review - Anarchy Online I am currently a member of the Beta community for Anarchy Online. For weeks now many of the community members have spent hours upon hours trying to solve countless unaddressed problems that FunCom are ignoring. To sum it up. Anarchy Online is an advanced and very graphical RPG, if you can get it to work.  I personally believe that no self respecting programmer out there that would launch a game in a state like this. If you want to buy it, wait a few months.	-1
This is a great game but these Amazon sellers are charging over price for this game.  The extra levels you can get on Xbox live Marketplace if you have the regular edition.  Don't pay unreasonable prices.  So buy the regular version.  Then download the extra levels on xbox live.  Have fun and don't let these sellers take advantage of you.  They shouldn't be overcharging in this economy ;)	-1
In theory, combining Capcom's and SNK's characters into one fighting game would be an awesome idea. Both companies are held in high regard when it comes to the fighting genre, but Capcom Vs. SNK suffers from too many gameplay and animation problems. First off, the gameplay favors SNK heavily.  Capcom's characters are watered down to only 4 attack buttons because of this, and that alone is enough to disappoint me.  The SNK characters remain intact for the most part though, save for a few missing special moves. Plus, the whole "ratio" thing (being able to choose how many characters you can play as based on their rank) is just a confusing mess. The animation is also cut tremendously, and the whole game is set at a low resolution so that each character looks pixelated. I believe the bottom line is that if you are a devoted Capcom fan, you will most likely be let down by Capcom Vs. SNK.  If you like the SNK games however, such as King Of Fighters and Fatal Fury, you may want to check this game out.	-1
broke after about of month of use and won't but another because of that.just becaise of the poor build quality	-1
This is a review of this product:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Super-Bust-A-Move-PlayStation-2-video-game/dp/B000055Y1L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Super Bust-A-Move (PlayStation 2 video game)</a>.  Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply.  After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.  (This is a review that I originally wrote on 07/04/2003) --------------------------------------------------  I can't believe all the good reviews this game is getting. I just have to chime in with my opinion on this game.  Simply put, they broke Bust-A-Move. They removed almost all of the game play modes; they removed the edit mode; they made the controls unresponsive (they take a second to respond); they added annoying and distracting backgrounds; the bubbles have been graphically-enhanced so they they, too, are now annoying to look at; they took away all the cool characters and added a bunch of Pokemon rejects; and they added a TON of long loading screens.  Most of that is pretty much self-explanatory, so I don't need to elaborate on it. However, I will give you a list of what few game play modes there are in the game:  - 1 Player: Training / Normal / Classic - CPU Battle: Normal / Expert - 2 Player Battle: Normal / Expert / Chain Reaction  Yup, that's it.  I rented this game to see if I had made a mistake buying Bust-A-Move 4 (for the Playstation 1). Well, I can tell you this, my purchase of Bust-A-Move 4 was definitely well worth it. I have&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Super-Bust-A-Move-2/dp/B00006LU8X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Super Bust-A-Move 2</a>&nbsp;on my rental list. Although I suspect that it won't be much better than this one, I'll still be optimistic and give it a try.  If you want a good Bust-A-Move game to play on your Playstation 2, get yourself&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bust-A-Move-99/dp/B00000I1BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bust-A-Move '99</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bust-A-Move-4/dp/B000034DD1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bust-A-Move 4</a>&nbsp;(both for the Playstation 1). Both are essentially the same, though 4 adds pulleys to the puzzles. Sure the graphics look like they came off of a SNES, but is that really such a bad thing?!? The load times are short (to non-existent at times), the characters look cool (in that odd-Japanese way), and most of all, the controls are extremely responsive and there are a ton of game play modes.	-1
The Jak games are awesome, and we also enjoy racing games. You'd think the combination would be awesome, but it was a fail in my opinion. We played a few times and haven't played it since.	-1
I've tried many times to play this game,and didn't get to even play it the first few times as it would just say that it's saving and would stay that way for an hour or more. Then I kept trying,and finally made it past certain points,but then the game screwed up again. So,I gave up on it. I am hoping that the seller wasn't being a snake and knew this game has a memory card glitch and still sold it. I wrote a review for this game a few days ago and I guess amazon wouldn't let me post for some reason. I was just trying to warn people of this game problem and possibly the seller I had ordered from. I didn't get very far in the game. Only a couple of missions before I have up! MAKE SURE THE ONE YOU'RE RECEIVING WORKS!Watch out for some sellers on here! I would return it,but I'd rather not waste MORE money. It's too bad I was really looking forward to playing this and this game had a different twist to the series which I liked....Oh well!	-1
Now this game has gotten great reviews. A lot of my freinds have it and love it. But I just don't understand why. Wiping out is cool and a lot of fun on the stunt mode and thats why I gave it the 2 stars. Racing is boring. I tjought ATVs would of worked but I guess they didnt. Better just stick to cars and motorcycles.	-1
I have no doubt that this is a totally accurate simulation of riding a 4 wheeler.  Unfortunatly, the game is not fun at all.  It's totally slow-paced; the play modes and tracks are all very similar; the trick-based game is a complete letdown and the game is very difficult.  After spending a week trying to get past the third track in pro mode, I gave up on this game.  Yeah, maybe I'not good at video games, but SSX was a billion times more fun.  I struggled on some courses, and eventually got through.  Same experience with Tony Hawk.  This, however, is just not a fun game.	-1
I bought this game because the sales charts revealed it was a top-seller... But now that I've played it, I can only assume that everyone else was as duped as I was. This game is terrible. The graphics, I will admit, are amazing, but the game play is just down-right uninnovated. You can't take shortcuts (even tho the box says "careen off the dirt path") and the machinery isn't different enough. They did spend a lot of money on the music and instruction booklet, as the first includes tracks from Alice in Chains and Soundgarden and the later which is a full-color 49 page manual. But if you want a good off-road racing game, buy Rumble Racing.	-1
I bought this game because people said its better than SSX.  Not true at all!  This game is nothing compared to SSX.  You should rent this before you buy it!  I am glad this game is so popular because I was able to sell it very easy and fast!!	-1
Well the answer is in this game. The racing itself as a sport is nothing that makes the player happy, but this game ruins any chances for ATV racing. Its hard to turn and all the cars stink. In freestyle mode, the lamest tricks are only successful when you land it just right. The reason why I did not give it a one is because the graphics are above average and the vast  freestyle levels are nice and a little more interesting than the actual racing, which will tire out after ten minutes. If you want a racing game or offroad game wait and rent something like 4X4 EVO or just buy Gran Turismo 3	-1
Ok it is hard not to compare this with rogue squadron. But you cant. While rogue had good graphics,killer gamplay, alot of ships to choose from(no b wing oddly) easyish unlockables and huge replayability. Battle for naboo, is...well. The opposite. 3 vehicle choices, garbage disposal graphics, boring story. No replayability (i never beat it i hated it so much, and traded it for body harvest) avoid this-i think ull think its a waste of money	-1
After reading a lot of the reviews here, it convinced me that this next version of Rouge Sqaudren was just as good, or even, better then Rougue.  Well, I've played Rougue Squadren many, many times, again and again over the years.. and I just recently bought this game expecting a game thats just as good, but I have been let down dramaticly.  First off. You need to know passwords to access things to help you to get through a lot of the levels, it's too hard without them. The game play is sluggish at times, but a lot of the feel of R.S is lost in this version. There is no veiw from inside the cockpit in this one either.  Secondly, there is hardly any ships you can use. Even when you unlock all the crafts, there is only the Naboo fighter (which is in Rouge Squadren if you use the code to unlock it) and it's just the same as an X-wing. There is a Naboo Bomber. Which is just like the bombers in R.S only it's a four engine Naboo plane, very slow, hard to monover and almost useless at times. There is a Naboo Police fighter or something that is just a Blue Naboo fighter with less capabilities, you can also unlock the Sith fighter, which is probably the best one to use on mission thats you can use it in. On other levels there is ones where you use Speeders, there's 3 speeder roughly the same with diffrent speeds and guns but all handle about the same, plus you can unlock an ATT tank which is fun, but not helpfull in some areas. And there is a boat sort of thing you use on a couple of water levels. This game lacks fun with the ships because most of them are the same with different speeds.. at least R.S you knew which ship was best for what and could use them on most missions, this one has a few levels where you can use ships, but without codes you can only use 1 per level, and when you get the medals you can have about 3 to choose a level, or 4 if you have codes.  Gaining medals in this one blows, because in R.S you needed the infinitie lives code to win, but in this one you still have to have 3 lives left to achieve it, because even tho you won't get a game over, the end stats still say you crashed or died -3 times, which makes it annoying to stay alive and not commit suicide to get your rockets, or missles back to hom ein on enemys for a much easier and quicker win.  When reading things here I thought when they said you could change ships during a mission meant during the game at any time, but thats not the case at all. In a couple of the missions you start off with a ground patrol, or a flight patrol and find your way to a hanger and THEN you select what craft you want to continue the mission with. That idea is ok, I guess.. but doesnt make this game better then R.S.  It's very hard to see vice droids when your shooting at them. They blend in with the back ground color, and there not easy to target for some reason untill your up close to them.  The 3 bonus missions arnt much, the most fun I had on one of the missions was the last one, the battle above Naboo. You have to take out the sheilds and radars of that ship Aniken blows up from the inside. It's short, but not too bad.  There are a few changes from R.S, but this one is a downfall compared to it. It's not as much fun, there not enough crafts, it would have been nice for codes to enable the Falcon or Tie Fighter or X-wings or something... it's imposible to get the medals above the Gold rank.  This game lacks the fun and adventture the last one had.	-1
At first I was impressed with this sorry excuse for a game, but after playing it for a week, I win every time when I play against the computer.  But really what is the worst is that the AI of the game [stink].  It just is worthless.  So in a...attempt to make it more challenging, it cheats.  You ever charge 3 heavy calvary with 60 of your heavy calvary only to be beaten because the 3 heavy calvary you attacked just happened to have their daimyo?  Come on, how stupid is that?  There are a million bugs the game uses to get an advantage, which is a real shame, because the frustration it builds just does not make the game worth it. It is also a joy to get your troops stuck on the side of a mountain and it is just impossible to manuerver them anymore.  Never has a game had such potential just to [stink].	-1
Keep in mind that it is an older game and that newer games have spoiled me a bit.  The graphics are ok at best, even when comparing it to other games which are about 10 years old.  The story is lacking and the game is very linear when it comes to options.  I probably would not purchase it again.  Not really worth the time.	-1
First off I would like to congratulate EA for making a SUPERB trailer for Undying, hell, I was caught off guard, I began my immediate purchase on my road for supah-dupah disappointment.  It's not scary, I think it's even funny. The characters aren't scary, the SFX SUX, the textures are almost too wide, its ridiculous. I really tried hard to be scared but I just couldnt. I tried to enjoy it but I failed. It's like playing Counter Strike while on PCP.	-1
I really should not write a review but I am because this game did not in it's description that is is NOT for Windows 7!!	-1
This thing is about as ergonomic as a prison bench. The ability to change it from a right handed controller to a left handed one seems like a good idea, but it came with too high a price. -Four of the control buttons are located directly in front of the stick, hard to reach anyway, but they're only about a mile away from the throttle control; useless for those `I gotta hit this button now or I will die' moments every gamer faces. Because once you move your fingers from the throttle waaaaayyy down to the f1-f4 buttons, its all over. They did this, logically, to save the expense of having to place opposite, mirroring buttons beneath both the right and left throttle ports.   Speaking of throttle....the wheel based throttle control has about 45 degrees of travel between zero and maximum, way too much for comfort. It forces the user to stretch out the arm too far, which, over hours of gameplay can really become uncomfortable.   The stick itself: No doubt you've noticed from the pictures, there's this strange looking protrusion from the back of the stick? `What could this be?' One ponders upon first glance. Well, I shall not keep you in suspense....This little plastic protrusion is an incredibly intelligent and novel idea gone sadly awry. The upright `u' shaped piece is designed to nicely support your hand, the big muscle beneath you thumb sits atop it, while the flat portion of this device supports the edge of your hand. It's a great idea executed poorly.  Because of its placement, your hand always ends up coming away from the most comfortable resting position in favor of better stick control.  It would work very well, if the human body did not have shoulders, that is.  This resting point can be moved up and down according to you preference, but it's just another feature I found completely useless-it stayed where it was when I took it out of the box ...All this thick quagmire of discomfort results in one thing- sore wrists and elbows.   The trigger is pretty nice, performs well and is, unfortunately, the most functional thing about this controller.  There are three buttons atop the sticks head, they're very easy to hit, in fact, too easy to hit. Often the user will find themselves executing commands because they've accidentally hit one or more of these buttons. Like most controllers, there is an eight way point of view or `hat' switch up top too. -It works, but it too is much too sensitive due to the length of its design, which gives your finger too much leverage on it and makes it very easy to press sideways when you wanted to press upwards.   The customizable features of this controller make it unique; It's a fantastically intelligent idea.  Too bad Saitek didn't do some research and development utilizing HUMAN hands.  The head has three positions: Straight up, angled left, and angled right. I found it to be absolutely, positively, useless. -It stayed straight for my gaming needs; the angled positions just made it easier to accidentally hit the three buttons up top. Not something this controller needs.  There are also three up and down angle positions, which is nice, because you never know when you might want to put the top control buttons as far away as possible so you can place your hand in slightly different uncomfortable position to even out the aches in your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. I mean, hey, why not make your thumb uncomfortable too? Just to be consistent.   Overall construction isn't terrible: It won't fall apart if you drop it. But if you're buying this for your teenager or tend to destroy controllers yourself, look for something a little more substantial. Even the base is lightweight plastic.   Now that I've said everything bad about this controller, how about some of the good: The handling of the stick is very good. There is a nice spring at the base of the stick, making excellent, consistent resistance....which translates to good in-game control.  The spring also is responsible for returning the stick to center, and it does a dang fine job of it. Twist control, too, is very responsive, and it returns to center very well, which means your gaming screen only rolls or twists when you want it too. ...The only other good thing I can think of about this controller is...um...well...it looks cool, doesn't it?   To summarize things: This controller incorporates some very novel, intelligent ideas but executes them about as well as an albatross makes a landing.	-1
Didn't work for me	-1
I purchased this yoke in May, 2014.  It worked great until about a month ago.  I first use the CH Manager to calibrate the yoke.  After calibration, I load a 737 and the N1 setting begins at about 43%.  When I press the F1 key, the throttle goes to apx 21% which is where it should be.  When I let up on the F1 key, the throttle (N1 setting) automatically goes back to 43%.  I can not get the throttle to idle, and this is after calibration.  Also, the raw data column in the Manager shows the setting is not constant.  If you can't get a constant setting, the yoke can not be used.  I have also used FSX's internal calibration capability, but I get the same results.	-1
The only good think I have to say about this game is that is does look really good! The graphics are great but that's the only great think about this game! I am totally disappointed with what they did to this game vs. what they could have done! If you are expecting to see a "double dragon" kind of 2 players with out a split screen type of fighting then think again. Next to that, you get the cheesy characters with the same ole cheesy names and cheesy story line! If you like story based fighting/action games that are very poorly thought out then you will like this one! Other wise, rent it, play it 2 or 3 times and then promptly return it and count yourself lucky you didn't waste your money on this stink bomb of a game!	-1
This game looks fantastic.  It's visually stunning and works the PS2's capabilities to a great extent.  The sound and cinematics are nice too.. ..but that's about where the fun stops.  This is a brawling game where you get to pick one of three fighters in single-player mode.  The controls are limited and clumsy (but the buttons are pressure sensative, which is kind of cool).  There's not much in the way of skill here...mash mash mash, you know? I was excited about this game, but got instantly bored when I played it for the first time.  Thank goodness there's a return policy at Babbages. Don't buy this one.  It's short and boring..and pretty slow.  Not good for a fighter/brawler.	-1
The story begins at a bar as a bouncer named Sion is beginning his shift for the day. A quiet morning is abruptly interrupted when a break-in occurs and the intruders manage to kidnap Sion's friend Dominque. This begins a dangerous rescue mission, as Sion and his fellow bouncers travel far and wide in search of Dominique's kidnappers. This is the setup to one of the sweetest looking games to come out in a long time.  That's right, Bouncer produces some of the most astonsing visiuls ever.  The graphics are topnotch and all the cinamas happen in real time...cool stuff. While the graphics are good, the major flaw comes with the gameplay.  Its mindless button massing, nothing more.  The game could be beat by press one button the entire time.  This causes the game to get boring and repetive, thus making you want to turn off the game. If the gameplay was good I wouldn't have mind playing it for its 2 hour playtime.  Yep, 2 hours, and that's it.  The game is way to short witch could be good or bad depending on how you look at it.  Good side, you don't have to play this bad game that long to beat it and you could also beat it in the time you rent it.  Bad side, its only 2 hours long....not worth the money at all. So in the end, you could rent it and beat it just to see the graphics but other than that you could advoid it all together.	-1
...I wouldn't pay $.... Yet, that's exactly what I feel like I bought after playing through Squaresoft's first foray into the land of the PS2. Yes, this game has incredible graphics and wonderful sound, as any movie should. What it lacks, however, is any sort of creativity. I mean, I felt like I was playing Final Fight or Double Dragon again. Square has raised the bar so much with their sparkling RPG's, and it is a shame that this product managed to creep out of the warehouse. Let's hope that Square does better the next time (as I know they will)...	-1
I thought Bouncer might be the perfect game, in which I could sit back between the action and watch hours of beautiful Square full motion video.  Sadly the --game-- part of the Bouncer is pretty darn boring.  You fight bad guys in an old school Double Dragons sort of way, wave after wave of them, but it just isn't that much fun.  No challenge, no great skill required, except that you must be prepared for pain from your thumb mashing the buttons for 2 hours. The graphics are beautiful, no, beyond beautiful.  These graphics are the reason I bought a PS2 in the first place.  The story switches back and forth between rendered FMV and movies the PS2 generates itself, and at times I can't tell what kind I'm watching.  It doesn't matter, the graphics are the best I've ever seen.  However, the story they tell isn't all that interesting, and I always skipped a movie if I have seen it before.  Ultimately, the weak story, poor gameplay, and the terrible pace from the combination of the two pretty much make the graphics uninteresting.  Pretty, but not worth buying. Don't buy this game...	-1
I will start off by saying SHORT.  2 Hrs max.  The concept of building up your characters is nice but not worth playing through 3 times to max them out.  Also the Story lines for each character aren't worth playing them through either.  When you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases.  The graphics are nice which they should be.  Expected more from Square but wait I usually do......and they usually don't.	-1
Ideally, this is a game you would buy with 2 other friends, each chipping in about 15-20 bucks.  Ideally, each of you could play one of the 3 characters as you advance through the story.  Ideally, this game -- which is really quite eye-catching and fun to play -- would last you a few weeks.  Unfortunately, the latter 2 are not true and you're definitely better off splitting this game with some buddies rather than plunking down all of the cash for this yourself.  I beat the game sitting down with it one night.  It is an incredibly short game. That's not to say it isn't fun.  I ended up playing it over and over again to buff up my characters (you really have to run through the game a few times to get each of the Bouncers pumped up to enjoy it).  Still, I couldn't help but feel cheated that a game that is as expensive as this one is should have lasted longer.  When I played Ps1 games like Jedi Power Battles, the Resident Evil series, etc., they would take me 1-3 weeks at least to finish.  Sadly, most of the "first wave" of Ps2 games are "wham bam thank you sony". Like any of the first year games, this one is good for the combined fighting tactics you and the computer use to beat the bad guys.  It pains me that you could not get that 2nd joystick to work and have a buddy at least partner up with you.  If Jedi Power Battles can do that, why couldn't this game?  My expectations were set for a "team up" game -- and this game allows up to 4 people to play but only in the "match" mode. As with any of the new Ps2 games, the story here less coherent than a Goddard film, but it is fun nonetheless.  Some of the combat and movie sequences are really cool (I'll nominate Dominque's "coming out of the closet" scene as my favorite). Although I just got done rating "X Squad" with a 3, and I'd give "Warlords" a 4 stars, this one sadly deserves only 2.  I would buy it used or buy it with a friend so that after the adreniline high of the game is gone, and only 4-8 hours have passed, you're feel that it was worth it. Oh, this one truly has some of the most absurd "movie" moments you're likely to see in a videogame.  I would swear that videogame scripts and plots have a weird aestethic up there with the films of Roger Corman and Ed Wood:  dialogue and plot connections so bizarre and painful that they are funny.	-1
Don't get me wrong -- I love Square's "Final Fantasy" RPG's and was one of the few loyal defenders of the Square / Dream Factory fighter "Ehrgeiz".  So I'm strongly inclined to like this RPG'ish slug-fest. But oh my gosh, is this awful. The gameplay here is a variation on old-school beat-em-ups (use simple fighting moves to dispatch hordes of drones, move forward through a level, fight a boss, yada yada yada).  The controls are similar to Ehrgeiz and the Tobal games: full 3-D movement, high/middle/low attack buttons, a simple block button.  But there are few combos, the fighting and movement feels slow, and there's some genuine cheapness to the bosses... blech! The graphics, both in-game and cinematics, are wonderful -- in fact, the visuals created by the game engine are often as good as the pre-rendered stuff.  And the story, for what it is (sci-fi action fodder), is perfectly agreeable.  But you can't help but think that the presentation is where all the development time went -- busy as they were with all the visuals, somone forgot to make sure the thing was fun to play. The core of the game is a story-mode, billed on the package as "Play the action movie!".  More like watch some stuff, play a little, watch more, play a little.  What's really painful is when you die in a particularly hard battle, you have to go back to the title screen, reload your game from the memory card, and watch or skip however many movie-scenes transpired between that save-point and the fight you want to restart (you'll also suffer the loading-screen between these skipped movie scenes).  You can literally play for 30 seconds, die, and spend 5 minutes getting back to where you were. Beyond the story-mode, there's a 4-person slug-fest and a survival mode, neither as engaging as similar modes in real fighting games like "DOA2". Despite the awesome presentation, this isn't even as good as "Dynasty Warriors 2", Koei's far less ambitious PS2 beat-em-up.  At least that game could keep the action going for longer than two minutes without becoming boring or stopping for a loading screen. I'd love it if Square's "Final Fantasy X" had the production values of "The Bouncer"... but I hope it has the gameplay of "Chrono Cross" instead of this ambitous train-wreck.	-1
The Bouncer has been one of the most anticipated games for the PS2, and it being a Square title, you'd figure that it's well worth the wait...but dear sweet lord, it's not.  It's actually the worst excuse for a game that I've played in years, and Square should be ashamed of even putting this thing up for sale. Basically, The Bouncer is a fighting game with hardly any actual combat...just loads and loads of cinemas.  It's mostly a non-interactive, interactive movie, with a terrible story (something about a girl getting kidnapped by some mega-corporation with evil schemes), uninteresting and under-developed characters, and an awful game engine.  This thing seems to have been created as an show-off vehicle for Square's art department, and it seems to be little more than self-indulgent demo.  If you skip the skads of cinematics, you can breeze through this game in under an hour (!!!!!!) and once you've beaten it, you're supposed to go back and play with other characters to unlock more hidden features, but once is waaaaaaay more than enough.  Combat consists of hitting a few buttons over and over, with little strategy involving moves, because once you gain one decent attack, you'll pretty much stick with that one time after time.  The combat sequences aren't even that long, and you'll be watching two or three cinemas longer than the actual battle once you've beaten a level, which is completely absurd.  If you're looking to play one of the worst "games" released this year, then RENT but do not buy The Bouncer.	-1
This does not work on Windows 7 64bit. No way. No how. The world you 'lose yourself in' is the world of frustration and cursing Ubisoft.	-1
The flower zone is too dull, in fact this whole game is dull, dull, dull. There is no story, and the puzzels are just plain stupid. Spend hours arranging reflectors. I don't think so. And let me tell you about the flower zone. First of all, the graphics rely on 'jumping' to the next point, so there is little pathway to follow, given that there is no 3d progress to take you to the next point of play. The screen jumps to your next location in even a more lazy way than Riddle of the Shinx did. Plus, once you have 'landed' at the next point in the 'jump', the stupid game has you turned off the point you 'landed at' so that you are looking cockeyed. I really hate how that happens...programmers, please place us facing the way we landed. I am not anal enough to want to figure out how I can go down a path and end up facing a direction I did not turn to face... I hated Schizm, but I think I hate this more. It is really a bad game. I have played many adventure games, but this is really lousy.	-1
I just could not get into this game.  I really liked Riven, but Myst III does not, in any way, compel me to keep on trying to solve the puzzles in order to get farther.  I solved the first major puzzle, which involved lining up reflecting lights in order of color to open a door on an island.  It took me a while, but I finally figured it out, and opened the door...only to find another puzzle preventing me from opening the NEXT door.  I mean, come on.  I guess I'm just not a big fan of puzzle games anymore, or something.  The story does NOT make me want to solve them, at any rate.  It's slow and sluggish, at least at first (I never got past the first part, because I was just too bored.) So, the eagerly-awaited Myst III: Exile is sitting on my desk, collecting dust.  I feel absolutely no urge to go play it, although I will give it one star for the pretty graphics. Buy this game only if you really, REALLY like thinking and solving almost-impossible puzzles.  Everyone I know who has this game was forced to buy the guide to go with it.	-1
Hi, When I first loaded this game I couldn't get past the title screen.  I e-mailed support and had no luck getting it to work.  Based on my negative review here on Amazon, Greg Uhler, one of the games producers, e-mailed me PERSONALLY to try to help. As it turns out, I e-mailed all my information and he gave me a solution right away!  Now the game runs great. I cannot thank Greg enough for his personal help! In case you would like to know what I did: I manually set my monitor resolution to 640x480 and 32-bit color.  That's all it took.  BTW I have a voodoo2 12MB, so if you have had any troubles try this! Rich Rossi -----------Old---------- As many of you know, this game had some serious support problems. I was never able to get it to work even though my computer exceeds all the system requirements. I talked to support, and recieved an answer and a follow up answer...then nothing. ....Now I am stuck with a game that will not run on a computer that it is advertized to work on. .... You have been warned.	-1
I bought Myst III over one week ago. Until now, I have not been able to play this game at all. Here is why: After installation, the game needs CD-ROM disk 2 in order to start the game. However, after I loaded the appropriate disk, the program did not recognize that it was, in fact, in the drive and kept requesting it. I finally went to the Myst website for assistance. There, I found that Ubisoft "is aware of the problem and for now recommends to the user to change the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive to 'something lower than H'". Added is a small, short note with a warning that "changing the drive letter could cause other programs to not work correctly". It continues with "...We are working on a better fix for the problem...". So of course I am not going to change my drive letters around - who knows what that will do to my system! While I am happy that Ubisoft apparently is aware of the problem, it bugs me immensely that they would throw such a game out on the market which obviously isn't up to today's systems. My CD-ROM drive is drive letter N, and I can honestly say that no game I have played in the past has ever had trouble recognizing it. I have now shelled out money for a game that sits on the shelf until Ubisoft comes up with that promised fix - inquiries about how long this will take were not answered to this day. I can only imagine how many more troubles are waiting for me once I'll get around the disk 2 problem. As to the game itself: I wish I could say something about it. I really do!	-1
Wow, where to begin.  I popped this game into my PS2 after several months of Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001.  I had forgotten how crappy the Triple Play series had declined to, but was almost immediately reminded in full as all the bad memories came back.  I had to force myself to finish a season last year with TP 2001.  I finished 1st with 116 wins (only because I quit trying after the all-star break to try and make it a little more competitive).  I had 95 homeruns and 196 RBI's with a player I created.  I could mention the errors in TP 2001 all day but won't because I am reviewing Triple Play for the PS2.  The graphics are a given, as is true with every PS2 game, so there's no need to goo goo ga ga over good graphics.  The gameplay is virtually UNCHANGED from the PS1 series!!!  I can't believe with today's technology, they couldn't produce a better product.  I haven't played the game very much because of terrible boredom, so some of my facts may be inaccurate, but I doubt it.  The baserunning still feels like you're playing T-ball in kindergarten.  If you hit a line drive to the wall in right-center, most of the time your runner only gets a single because he's too slow to make it to second.  Not to mention that the runner on first can be thrown out at third.... on a ball hit to the wall that should be a stand-up double for the hitter, and should score the guy on first with no chance of a play at the plate!!!  Instead you end up with a guy on first and third and your next batter will likely ground into a double play to end the inning, which explains why you can have 3 runs on 25 hits when the game is over and batting averages over .700 for the season!!  The AI (Artificial Intelligence) is absulutely horrible.  Ex. The computer has a runner on second base.  The hitter hits a slow roller through the left side that escapes the SS.  It takes the outfielder 10 seconds to get to the ball, which has completely stopped rolling in the outfield, and the runner rounds third and goes back to third every time.  EVERY TIME!  The runner never scores from 2nd on a single.  The computer never steals bases.  The only time you ever get a triple is when the ball is misplayed and rolls to the wall.  Then you almost get thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple when it should be a stand-up.  At this point I was looking for a single sign that this game was improved from last year's PS1 version.  If there is an improvement, it's that you have to place the cursor on the ball when you bat.  That may help control batting averages a bit.  You can still get 3 or 4 hits in an inning and not score a run because of the horrible baserunning and double plays.  I almost forgot.  I was looking for a way to give me complete control over my baserunners and couldn't find one.  So every time I hit a ball to the wall and want to run for a double, the AI retreats my baserunner for me and I get one of the longest singles in baseball history.  There may be a way to change that but I haven't found it.  Nor will I because I'm probably not going to play it again.  The game still seems very choppy.  The player movements are still sub-par.  Ex.  You have 2 outs in the inning and you ground to the first baseman.  He snags the ground ball and quickly runs to first base, taps the bag, and jerks back into 1st base position without breaking stride.  He should be going to the dugout, the inning is over.  I haven't played to game enough to know if it still freezes with 2 outs in the 9th inning.  It probably does.  Ok, the commentary.  When are they going to quit saying those same stupid things that they've been saying for years.  The little stories that Buck Martinez tells over and over again during the same game.  The sound of the game blows too.  I use to play baseball and never did I hit the ball so hard that it sounded like a blast of dynamite.  Is this what EA Sports has to resort to to make thier product more interresting?  You also can't change settings in the beginning to turn the stupid soundtrack music off.  It plays the same verse over and over and over again.  You're ready to heave the game into the wall before you ever begin.  It's worse than the "Magic Carpet Ride" of last year's.  At least Madden 2001 allows you to turn that crap off.  There are almost no options in this game.  You cannot customize your gameplay.  No franchise mode (not that I'd use it anyway), or customized level of play.  I could easily win 150 of 162 games with an all-star setting.  I think EA Sports has sunk it's ship with this one.  The only EA Sports titles even worth playing are Madden and NHL, and both of those have their problems.  Don't waste your money even renting this one.  I'd love to have my $6.35 back.  So far I'm not impressed with PS2 sports titles, but their day is coming.  3DO's High Heat Baseball 2001 for PS1 is by far the best Baseball Simulation I have ever played in terms of realism and gameplay.  Awesome.  I have heard great things about Akklaim's All-Star Baseball series for the N64.  I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of both, but if HH 2002 follows it's predecessor closely with a few minor changes, I will never need another baseball game.  As for EA Sports, sorry, but you need to get on it or get passed by your competition.  You no longer reign and your reputation is headed south.	-1
I've been playing Triple Play Baseball since the 1998 edition.  Each year as baseball season rolls around, I've been duped (yes, duped) into buying the latest edition of Triple Play baseball. Never again. Now, let me say this: if you're not a true, diehard fan of the national pastime, if you don't get goosebumps at the conclusion of the of the Star Spangled Banner, if the thought of a dog and a beer and the pastoral pleasures of a 2-1 pitchers' duel don't appeal to you, then this game may be for you. In short, if you're looking for a baseball game with all the trimmings of an arcade game on steroids, then you will enjoy this game.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a true baseball sim, then you'll want to stay away from this game. There are no injuries.  There are very few extra base hits.  The pitcher/batter interface is simply remedial.  (You know *exactly* where the ball is going to be pitched before it's thrown; all you have to do is make sure your cursor is lined up right and gauge the speed.)  You don't have to warm up the relief pitchers.  It's impossible to strike out the CPU.  (To the other extreme, on All Star Baseball, I had 14 K's with Greg Maddux, who is NOT a strikeout pitcher.)  There are no walks. In addition, there is no franchise mode.  Will we EVER see a game that combines great graphics, actual baseball simulation, great gameplay AND a franchise mode? On the positive side, the graphics are terrific, and the controls are better than those on All Star Baseball. Simply put, all that's missing is the keg.  Afterall playing this game is no better than playing in an industrial league softball tournament. If you're a casual baseball fan, this game's for you.  However, if you're a baseball purist, this game is not for you.  Unfortunately, there's not a single baseball game currently out for the PS2 that's worth the $50. We have to wait until 2002...	-1
I have never been a fan of this series but not because I have some bias towards EA.  (I like Madden and other cool EA games). Wanting a good baseball game for my overrated PS2 system, I gave this game a shot.  First of all, the one good thing: the graphics.  I think it has the best graphics out of the three PS2 baseball games. Now the bad: If you want a 1-P game, this game may suit your need if you just want to smash home-runs after another.  But for a 2-P experience, DON'T EVER BUY THIS THING.  The batter-pitcher interface has a major flaw which essentially tips the hitter of the pitch location.  The end result: games in the 20 runs are not uncommon. This is not baseball.	-1
After playing the outstanding Madden 2001 and the fast paced NHL2001 and NBA 2001, Triple Play Baseball for the ps2 is a major disappointment.  First, the fielding in the game is awkward and slow.  It was a major mistake of EA Sprots to drop the automatic fielding option in the game from previous years.  Second, there are no historical players, like in Triple Play 2001.  I always thought it was fun to be able to get Babe Ruth off the free agent market.  My advice: stick to last year's version.  The improved grphics don't make the game more fun.	-1
I bought this game with high expectations, but was rather disapointed after several hours of play.  The graphics do not apear to be much better than PSX quality.  The game itself looks and plays like a bad clone of Jetforce Gemeni for the N64.  After spending an hour of trying to find some one who would join me online (I couldn't find anyone who would), I went offline and played for a while.  The game played more like a shooter than a rpg.  As a fan of Phantasy Star 1-4, I was expecting something better.  I strongly advise a rental before buying to see if this game is your thing.	-1
I bought Phantasy Star Online after Sega shut their servers down and never experienced the online play but from what I read it was the only way to play this game. The graphics are good and the story could pass but the gameplay sucks if you have to play alone. I don't know why Sega put 4 controller ports on the Dreamcast if I gotta be online to experience the multiplayer aspect. A HUGE disappoitment avoid like stale toast with rotten eggs!!	-1
...what "Final Fantasy Tacitcs" was to the Final Fantasy series!  They both didn't have a lot to do with the series they were based off of. Yet they are both so addictive and fun you just don't care!  "Phantasy Star Online" is one of Dreamcast's best game and it's a no brainer as to why it was!  First of all it was made by Sonic Team (Which is lead by video game master Yugi Naka!), who has a record of making games based on how fun they are (Games like "Sonic Adventure," "Samba de Amigo," and "Chu Chu Rocket" to name a few!), and not on how good they look (Although they do look good too!!!)!  The main idea is to log online with up to four friends and chat with them as you kill monsters, unlock doors, find rare weapons, and blow up boxs!!!  Although this sounds like it would get boring fast it actually keeps you entertained with the chating part as you and your team-mates can make jokes, flirt with each other, cuss out the bad guys(Although there is a cencor that blocks cussing!  Sorry, but kids could be playing!), creat your own charicter, and blow up boxes!!!  Sound fun yet?  Well if this doesn't sound fun to you yet make sure you still have a pulse, you may be dead!  Although I do admitt that unless your online this stuff will be more than boring after 30 minutes!  And since the story is so non-existent playing this game for the story doesn't make much sense either!  Basicly, unless you plan on playing this online, you won't get your moneys worth if you play it offline!  But Sonic Team has proved one thing:  They sure do make some darn good games!	-1
This game is classified as an RPG right???? Well where is the RPG in it?? I'll I see is a Shoot'em up game. I was eager to play this game due to the fact the previous Phantasy Stars were really good. If I wanted a shoot'em up game I would have bought Quake 3 arena. It is an absolute disgrace to call this an RPG. If you are a die hard RPG, which I am, don't bought this game. Sell you're dreamcast and get Psx and buy Final Fantasy 9 instead. The only cool thing about this game is that you can set your characters weight, height and features. that is about it. So bottom line is that Sega flopped this one just like they do everything else. I'll stick with my Psx and Final Fantasy 9 thank you very much.	-1
Lousy deal did not work then had trouble sending back!	-1
At first I was very excited about this game. The graphics, combat system, and character development system are well made. I quickly found the battles to be time-consuming and boring. I would sit there while my party battled group after group of wandering monsters, when all I wanted to do is go somewhere nearby. The monsters automatically get stronger as you gain levels. This is a [jterrinle] feature, I think. RPG's should get easier as you gain levels, not more difficult (it made me not want to raise levels, because the battles only get harder). Another annoyance is the way your party is interrupted EVERY TIME it's your turn to walk or run during combat. I don't think that anyone could figure out the many clues and quests without the hint book. I certainly could not, and am not about to waste ten or twenty bucks to explore every nook and cranny of this game. The game world itself is small when compaired to simular games. After a week, I have been just about everywhere I can go (and that's only after playing about two hours a day).	-1
I have no idea why this game is so highly recommended by so many. The graphics are dated,and I can't imagine why directx 8 is needed for this game. I tried very hard to enjoy it but I can't see what's there that's new or different. I hate the interface,and have found no way to see your stack or even your own character. In a first person view you should be able to see your other party members,decide who you like ,check out their skills and move them around in position,but not possible in this world. I haven't played the previous Wizadry games,and maybe if I had and come along with the story as computer technology progressed,I might find it more interesting,but I don't really think so. If you are looking for fast paced action,great graphics,and an engrossing story Don't look here. All in all, Wizardy 8's only wizardry seems to have been in the pr. 1 star	-1
This "game" is simply a point at the monster and click and click until he is dead.  I custom created the characters but played the actual game for all but 30 minutes and yawned and went to bed.  Bor ing.  The voices were stupid and not funny at a all.  I personally think they should have been left out!  They completely ruined the game for me.  Dwarves don't sound like teenagers, and that's what the voices were, just like Might and Magic VI+.  Get some serious actors in there or don't even bother putting voices in at all! As for the interface, it was tedious and could only be controlled with the mouse, no hotkeys.  You click on an envelope and out comes a smiling face saying "let's get dangerous" or "I'm yer worst nightmare.." something equally stupid. You then deside wheather you want to attack with sword, gun or magic then click on the monster.  What a teenage concept, I think I'll stick with the classic games.  Dark Savant, Bane, ect.	-1
There are a number of people like myself experiencing a slowdown bug that makes the games all but unplayable. Every few seconds the game will pause for a 1/2 second or so! You might want to wait until a patch is released that fixes this annoying problem. Check the publisher's message boards for more info regarding this known annoyance. When I get this game working, I'm sure my rating will be 5 stars once i'm able to run this game as what i've seen and heard have been great.	-1
I guess if you spent the eighties playing Wizardry this game really does it for you.  For the rest of us it just doesn't cut it.  The graphics are straight out of 1992 and the control options are sad.  You're forced to pivot your POV around with keyboard keys like a tank turret which completely kills any feeling of suspense.  The character development within your party looked promising, but that's not enough to cary the dated game play.  I can't believe companies make games like this and put them on shelves next to modern titles and expect to make money.	-1
I suppose I felt gracious that Capcom felt the need to bring the X series back after so many months (and years) in between 4 and 5, but THIS isn't what I had in mind.  X4 was such a mind-blower that I was worried that any successive X titles wouldn't be able to hold a candle to it, and dammit if I wasn't right.  Thanks to the "efforts" of Capcom Production Studio 3, there're just too many things wrong with this title, namely a few too many changes in the formula that were both beneficial (the ability to duck) and problematic (not being able to shoot through walls??? FAIL!), and some of the worst boss designs and weapons made for the X series up to this point (I also wasn't too pleased with every boss being named after members of GUNS AND ROSES...I hate that band).  Then again, the level designs were pretty good, the switching between X and Zero between levels was a nice entry, the visual effects weren't bad, both armor types had their definitive uses and the plot was nicely done, but the influx of new characters, all those changes and the whole sense of finality made this the worst game in the X series and thus kept me from enjoying this as fully as I'd've liked (Inafune wanted to end the series on 5, thus all the attempts at tying up the loose ends plot-wise).  I was actually quite glad, in the end, for the introduction of X6, as I wouldn't've wanted the X series to end with such a flop.	-1
The first thing that comes to mind when a reviewer claims a game is terrible is probably "oh yeah mister smarty pants, you better be able to back up why you think Mega Man X5 is such a bad game".  I will try my best. :)  First of all, the gameplay.  Being a Mega Man fan since 1993, I grew up with the original Dr. Wily *and* the X series.  I love both.  People constantly pick which one they think is better, but in the end, I always found shooting robots incredibly fun and I still find it rewarding and addicting to play through a Mega Man game over and over searching for the very best way to blast through a stage and eliminate the enemies, along with finding the best way to defeat the boss at the end of the stage.  Mega Man is mainly supposed to be a side-scroller shooter.  THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING (sorry, big words make it easier to get my point across).  What does Mega Man X5 do?  It mostly abandons the need to really use your X-blaster for anything important, except for the stage bosses.  It makes me absolutely SICK TO MY STOMACH (sorry, the big words need to return) that Capcom chose to make at least half of the stages almost completely empty.  I don't know the name of the stage, but the forest level has almost NOTHING TO SHOOT.  You basically spend the entire time in this level just dash-jumping your way through, until you arrive to the end boss.  Oh okay, there are a couple things to shoot.  Lazily-designed and completely unmemorable bad guys are featured inside this forest stage (did I mention the backgrounds are bland-looking?)  When you arrive to these enemies (I think one of them is some kind of robotic plant, but I may be wrong) you actually have to wait a few seconds for them to shoot something uncreative and boring at you (which incidentally does very little damage).  Why am I WAITING for a slow-poke enemy to shoot something at me?  And in a MEGA MAN game, where speed and avoiding attacks is supposed to be the key to completing the game?  BORING!  Anyone who tries defending the stage enemies in this game is going to have an extremely tough time.  I wish that forest stage was the only problem with Mega Man X5, but sadly it's just the beginning.  I can't stand this game.  I can't stand the fact that Capcom removed *every single thing* I love about the Mega Man series.  It's like the company has something personal against me.  What to talk about next... okay, everybody hates the fact that the stage bosses are named after Guns 'N Roses band members.  This doesn't really bother me (even though I passionately hate Guns 'N Roses and think they are nothing but a sorry Aerosmith imitator rock band with a whiny, overrated lead singer).  I hate the fact that every stage boss can be defeated with *just* your X-buster.  Remember how important it was in past games to find the right weapon to successfully destroy the end boss?  Not now.  Each stage boss has ugly and lazy animations, and they move across the screen so slowly that it's very easy to just continue shooting at them with the X-buster while avoiding their lazy, slow attacks.  Believe it or not, all eight stage bosses can be defeated this way.  So much for strategy.  What a worthless game.  Whenever Capcom tries to make a Mega Man game tell a good story, the gameplay suffers as a result.  This game is the biggest offender.  The worst part is that they removed the cutscenes you were introduced to in Mega Man X4.  Now you have to scroll through boring text as the characters have their boring conversations, building no suspense whatsoever during critical moments.  Lengthy and frequent text-scrolling is what X5 is all about.  Oh, and let's not forget that Capcom just threw in a bunch of new friends to help guide Mega Man through the game.  I highly doubt anyone cares about these characters because Capcom just PUT them in the game and expected us to care about them without any kind of interesting history or connections to other Mega Man games.  Doesn't work that way.  Even if they were returning characters from the Wily series it wouldn't have bothered me.  The fact is, these new characters are a bunch of nobodys and even when you beat the game, they will remain nobodys.  Speaking of characters guiding you through the game, your female friend Alia INSULTS YOUR INTELLIGENCE numerous times throughout the game.  While you dash and shoot your way through each of the eight unmemorable stages (that is, when you actually arrive to something worth shooting) she will CONSTANTLY appear on screen to bug you and tell you *exactly* what it is you have to do.  This means more inconvenient text-scrolling.  Sometimes she interferes with your progress so often that you just wish there was a way to shoot and kill her.  It's incredibly annoying.  After finding out how disappointing X5 turned out to be, the LAST thing you want to do is put up with someone like Alia basically calling you a moron.  Alia insults your intelligence by telling you to do VERY simple things that anyone with ANY past experience with a Mega Man game would be able to understand without needing any pointless instructions.  She actually has the nerve to say things like "jump over that wall".  I THINK we already knew that.  Why?  BECAUSE WE'VE HAD TO DO THE SAME THING *MANY TIMES* IN THE PREVIOUS FOUR X GAMES AND *MANY TIMES* IN THE WILY GAMES.  WE'RE NOT DUMB!!!  The challenge in each stage ranges from very easy to incredibly difficult, which is quite surprising to me because the challenge in past X games was a lot more consistent.  The already mentioned forest stage is worthlessly boring, but more specifically, a cakewalk.  However, the flipside to that are really frustrating stages that require excellent, fast-moving timing in order to complete. So throughout the game you will go from incredibly simple stages where you don't even have to shoot at anything, to incredibly difficult stages where you are sure to die many times until you get it perfectly right.  I LIKE FUN MEGA MAN GAMES.  Not this inconsistent mess.  The game becomes almost excruciatingly difficult when you arrive to the very first stage in Sigma's castle.  The stage is ripped off completely from the Quick Man stage in Mega Man 2.  Remember jumping down and avoiding those laser beams?  Same thing.  In this game, trying to complete this task is MUCH harder.  At least three stage themes are pretty good.  That's it.  That's the only thing Mega Man X5 has going for it.  Oh, and speaking of music, the theme in one stage is just an updated version of the water stage theme from Mega Man X2.  I especially hate this stage because it's one of those stages where the screen pushes you to the right, and you have no control over it.  You are forced to go with the flow while avoiding shots from a giant underwater robot.  So much for fast-pace shooting/dashing action.  I hate this underwater stage more than the previously mentioned forest stage.  At least with the forest stage I can go "duh" and daydream my way through the empty thing.  Stare at the ceiling while you play through the forest stage.  I bet you can make it to the end boss!  Look, I love Capcom and think they're a wonderful company that does a fantastic job with action games, but they really screwed up with Mega Man X5.  Please avoid.  I can't be angry at a company that gave us so many good games, but when a game is rushed to the market and I believe no creativity or effort whatsoever was involved during the process of creating the game, it HAS to be mentioned.  That's what I did just now.  Told you why Mega Man X5 is so freakin' awful.  A lazy and unremarkable experience.  The game has no life.  Every company has their bad games, and this is clearly "the bad game" from Capcom.  Just pick up Mega Man X4 to find out what a really good action game should be like.  I can only imagine what X6 must be like.	-1
Nothing could have prepared me or any other true Mega Man X fan for how much they messed this game up.  Apparently there was a staff shake-up before it came out, something that would not surprise me one bit.  It seems that these new people wrote up a list entitled "Ways to make the players hate us."  Here's why.  1) Why did they mess up the armor system?  I was surprised and disillusioned to see you start off with the X4 armor.  Wasn't a lot of the fun in the first 4 games starting off with nothing and finding stuff as you went along?  It also does not help that they RUINED the plasma gun from X4 and no longer let you shoot through walls.  Sure there are capsules in X5, but now it's eight instead of four for two sets of armor.  That may sound cool, but acquiring them is more annoying than fun.  You can't even use an upgrade when you get the capsule.  You have to wait until you get all four pieces to the SAME armor before you can use ANY part you get.  Of course it doesn't help either that both the armors suck.  Neither of them looks appropriate for a general armor that would come to mind if you think "Mega Man X5."  When you think about the first game, you can think of the completed armor he had in it.  In X5, both the armors look too specialized, and that's exactly what they are.  The Gaea Armor has kind of a cool gun that of course breaks certain blocks, but it is no fun to use because you can only move very slowly in it, and you can't even mid-air dash or use weapons in it.  The Falcon Armor lets you fly for a period of roughly five to ten seconds, but when I first saw the powered-up gun for the Falcon Armor, I wasn't sure if I was kidding myself or not by what I saw.  It is the worst gun X has ever had.  Mega Man's Mega Buster from Mega Man 4 back on NES would blow it off the face of the planet, even the universe.  How they could make a gun this pathetic is beyond me.  Simply put, one armor's all gun and no movement, and the other's all movement and no gun.  Where's the balance here?  A good armor would have at least SOME balance.  2) For those who haven't played X5, you will be stopped frozen at least five times a stage forced to read annoying text messages transmitted to you from some stupid new ally named Alia who you'll just want to kill more than anything else.  Think of Navi or the owl from Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time except 100 times worse.  No, there's no way to skip or shut off Alia unless you're revisiting the stage and already listened to it (with the same character).  If the text messages were interesting and useful, it may have been pardonable, but no.  Instead we're babysat with lectures like "Don't jump on the spikes.  You'll die!"  "Get off the train!  It's exploding!"  I don't ever recall playing a Mega Man or X game to be babysat.  The new staff must have thought that all of us Mega Man veterans out there never progressed beyond 5 years of age.  They obviously never did, so it's quite possible.  Alia is shown with her with her mouth wide open wearing some sort of earphone device in the mission report screen in between stages (a part that has the some of the worst Mega Man or Mega Man X music ever created).  I'd love so much to stick a piece of dynamite in her wide open mouth and never have to listen to her again.  I'd love to do even worse to the morons who made this game.  Where did Alia, Signas, Douglas, and all these other dorks come from anyway?  Even at X8 it's a mystery.  3) There is absolutely NO creativity or set of new ideas in this game.  This is quite obvious considering that they brought back the Rock Monster for the boss of the first Sigma stage, the eye boss from the first game for the second Sigma stage, a time stopper weapon, the Quick Man laser beams, the Mega Man X capsule music for capsules, Bubble Crab's music for Duff McWhalen's stage, and much more.  Yes, you read correctly.  There is a boss called Duff McWhalen.  This brings the review to the bosses.  It's hard to contemplate how much they must have thought about different ways to make the bosses suck.  Just look at their names.  Izzy Glow?  The above mentioned Duff McWhalen?  Dark Dizzy?  The Skiver?  Axle the Red?  Are these supposed to be cool boss names?  The bosses in battle are not exactly inspiring either.  Most of them are just so ridiculously slow.  How long does the fat bear boss float through the air with his arms shaped as if he wanted to give you a hug?  I've lost count...  How long does the bat boss just slowly fly around the room and shoot NOTHING at you?  It can vary, but either way it's awfully long.  And did they even know that the firefly boss IZZY GLOW looks like he's defecating when he does his laser attacks?  Did they know that the fight with the horse boss of the sky stage is on an airplane much like Storm Eagle's from X1?  Did they know this boss even does some of the EXACT SAME attacks as Storm Eagle?  If I wanted to, I could find something bad to say about EVERY stage, boss, and weapon (of which X's none are cool or original) in the game, but I'll let players deduce that for themselves.  The only good thing I can say about the bosses is that I wish the squid boss were in another game because he's the only one close to cool (but not the weapon he gives X). I have never heard worse boss music before X5.  You can disagree with me if you want, but I really thought the boss music in X4 was exceptional, at least for Mega Man X boss music.  It was energetic and put you in a fighting mode.  X5's goes to sounding like some AWFUL messed up version of some dumb pop song.  I really wonder if they tested this game at all.  They obviously didn't test their own intelligence or capability.  4) X5 is simply almost no fun to play.  X is just horrible.  His attacks and weapons suck, and he does practically NO DAMAGE to bosses, even with the right weapon.  You'll be fighting bosses for ten minutes in the later stages with X unless you use the restrictive Gaea Armor or pick up the Ultimate Armor.  Having X and Zero available the whole game instead of choosing to play the whole game as one or the other may seem like a good idea at first, but it ended up being more frustrating than beneficial.  You have to figure out how to divide up the heart tanks, and Zero can't even get some of them.  You also have to revisit nearly every stage if you want to get everything, taking away from the players any motivation to form their own strategy, order, or way of playing in general.  There were absolutely NO new ideas or stage creativity or at ANY point in the game.  Some of the stages could just be cruised through with the Falcon Armor in under a minute.  Stage brevity has always, in my view, been a problem of these games, but X5 is the only instance in which I would not complain.  Wonder why... The whole time limit thing was also retarded.  All it did was prompt more annoying speech from Alia such as "You don't need to be here" if you picked a stage that didn't have a part for whatever you needed at the time.  There are not a whole lot of good things about this game at all.  Zero's crescent saber from the bear boss is cool, but that's about it.  This game is a miserable excuse for an addition to the Mega Man X series.  I wish I could have flown over to Japan and fired every single Capcom staff member who had anything to do with this game.  X5 is not a good game on any terms.  People who write reviews saying it's good or "Just another Mega Man game," do NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.  My guess is that the makers probably thought about "innovation," a word I have grown to hate.  "Innovation" in the modern sense of the word, does not have a place in the formula with the Mega Man X games.  The "innovation" in these games should come in the stage design and background, boss ideas, and weapon ideas.  It should NOT include messing up a whole foundation.  They put all this garbage in X5 and expect players to be happy because of a new ability to duck??  Sorry, I'll take no ducking any day.  As the result of this failed attempt at "innovation," X5 was the beginning of a period of disappointment that would last for the next few games.  I'll admit that I own the game being a fan (though by now possibly a former fan...), but even now I still want some form of brutal vengeance against Capcom for this bitter disappointment.	-1
this expansion pack [is really bad]! the livin large one was great but this one has nothing more than music and food. the dancers u can higher don't take off NONE of their clothes and u cant higher more than one entertainer at a time. the things that ARE good in this game are a birthday cake,punkin and the campfire.and also the all girl and all boy bathroom. once u buy the birthday cake, you are already starting a birthday party, u can choose who's birthday it is that day. this expansion pack doesnt come with the vibromatic heart bed either. when u get the sims house party you will feel like you are playing the original sims.	-1
What's new? You can screw up your Sims' lives, inject some romance or have them partying like wild dogs, other than that, what's new? Sadly nothing. Nothing at all. The Sims Expansion: House Party is basically an add-on pack that focus on the social interaction of your Sim(s). New Party items such as costumes, toys and an "improved" way to call your Sim friends are in this package. This is what I liked about this package. The new items, such as those electrifying cages, the time-saving pre ordered meals,the groovy disco floor tiles and the mechanical rodeo that somehow really add a punch to the whole "party" package, but that is all I find interesting about the expansion pack. To tell the truth, I kind of regretted buying it . Here is what I hate about this package. Unlike the previous expansion pack, The Sims: Livin' It Large  (which I enjoyed tremendously) this expansion pack doesn't have new neighbourhoods to build new Sim homes for. Sadly, most of the "new-items" in The Sims Expansion: House Party doesn't seem to be a big help to throw parties at all! And let's not talk about the party crasher! Instead of adding fun to the game (hey, it is fun to see your Sims screw up you know), this guy adds frustration! The gameplay is still basically the same. Click to have your Sim do this or that. Take care of their needs or forget about it to mess up their lives. Yawn. Intially, half the fun of playing The Sims comes from the humorous ways your Sims acts. Unfortunately, the game actually gets boring after playing it for a long time. The Sims Expansion: House Party could have been a great expansion pack to buy if it ACTUALLY had some new features (hey EA! Why not make the Sims fly?). Same old boring game with same old boring concept. Don't get this game unless you are a die-hard Sims fan. Save your money for something else.	-1
Welcome to the worlds most boring game.  When I ran this game for the first time I was very impressed with an introductory movie that was very long, detailed and creepy.  I couldn't wait to start playing to see more of that.  However, once I started playing I was dissappointed with this game and it's over-simplicity. There are only certain places that you can move to.  Want to go check out that dark corner over there?  Forget it, you can't.  You can turn around 360 degrees but only move in one direction, go figure.  You collect different items and solve different puzzles and that's all this game really is.  It's a pretty puzzle game.  There are no special effects and no movement by the monsters.  They just stand there and grunt at you. Not to mention this game is so pathetically easy that my four year old son could play it with no problems at all. Don't buy this game.  ....	-1
I just received my Dracula 2 game from ... today.  That's the good news.  When you open the box the only thing inside is the jewel case which contains the two CD's and the worlds shortest "manual". There appears to be no way to change the resolution settings, color settings, sound or anything else.  Or re-map the keyboard.  Keyboard?  There is nothing in the "manual" which shows keyboard assignments.  How do you move forward?  Who knows.  Backwards?  Run, walk or jump?  Who knows.  Want to use mouse invert?  Sorry about that. Having played PC games for a couple of years now I am conditioned to the fact that you're gonna get ... sometimes, and this is one of those times. Think of it this way:  I get to have turkey in April, because Dracula 2: the Last Sanctuary is a turkey (and it's not even Thanksgiving yet!).	-1
Snore fest.  Maybe this would have been fun in 1995, but here in 2009 this game is a bore.  You're limited to 3 weapons and this has a very 80's arcade feel to it, only even more lame.  This game is a wast of time and effort.  Pass on this one.	-1
So get this, I play this game on normal the second to last level. Meaning one more and it was the final boss. I went through hell. The game has you go through really tough things, and really boring environments. The hard part of the game is really the backtracking. I never needed a strategy guide, but jeez man what is this. Once I got underground, I had to backtrack like 8 times. So the second to final level had me going under lasers again. After I narrowly got by the lasers, I had to go on a catwalk to a small room. There was no cover across the catwalk, and it was easy to die. I ran across for my life to the room which was to the right of the catwalk. Right when I step in the room a missle comes at me and I lose all of my health, and my place. I had to restart from before the lasers. The games mechanics are fine, the bots are boring though. The longer you play, the more times the nuclear bomb thingy goes off. It went off once during my whole time, and that was right before getting to the underground. The game itself is boring. I hated bactracking, and I hated how the enemies always had the upperhand. It was relatively easy somewhat, but powerups and life refills were hard to find, so alot of the time I was at low health, knee deep in baddies. Again, the backtracking is horrible. But also the lasers. My gosh, you have to avoid these lasers on a roof and at the second to last level. The lasers are HARD to get by. You have to do split second reactions. You can only save once a level is complete, so get ready to make commitments. You can't reload from continues so you better finish that level. Again, I hate this game for making the second to last level so hard. Honestly, keep the level of difficulty at medium. How hard is it to make the game easier. Koei decided to make all that time I spent worthless, o and there was no way to beat the guy with the rocket launcher unless I had thousands of health, or a cheat on. I will never cheat, so that is that.	-1
This is the worst shooter game I have ever played. Weapons are pathetic, movement is akward, and aiming is purely painful. When I see the name KOIE on any other game I will certainly know not to by it. Seeing the 4 star average rating on this site makes me think that most of these reviews are bogus.( Has anyone ever seen a game with a poor rating on this site? I have not. This game diffenitly deserves a zero.) It disgusts me that there are games of this crappy nature allowed on the market. Give me a break.	-1
[....]Any team can become the champs of all the teams. You can be the darn expos and be about 100 games above 500. The sliders break too much and the curveballs are just between a change up and a fastball. the first one you throw is always awesome. Acclaim needs to make the game a little harder. The batting stances are outta wack. The brewers my favorite team is underrated(of course). With good players you hit 500 homeruns a year. on the back of the box they say franchise debut but there is no franchise [....]	-1
There's this song called deeper. This line had cussing in it. It is; You're damn right.	-1
My goodness... all these five star reviews really awe me... I've been a strong dreamcast player even years after it fizzled out early in the previous console wars. Sonic Adventure one was very fun game to play, but like most other dreamcast titles it was flawed. Those flaws were strongly outweighed with the many upsides of that title. I didn't give Sonic Adventure 2 a 1 star review because many people,including my own brother enjoyed this game. It also had a decent following. On a personal level however I feel they kept all the flaws from the original game, took out all the previous positive changes, and slapped a title on it. I was very disappointed. If you own the dreamcast I'd recommend getting the original before this one.	-1
This game is the worst in its genre. After the 2nd quake, which was also bad, came something even worse quake 3 arena. After playing the pc, then renting the game for ps2 i realized that both were bad. Terrible controls, you can't win on normal diffuculty since the guys kill you easily, and the arenas are small and are terrible-looking graphics. Don't buy this game, it is a waste of time and money!	-1
I did not enjoy the controls on this game.  The only entertaining part with the somewhat nudity that came with the game.  You know what they say, "Sex sells."  Well if that was their only selling point then I won't hold my breath for the next one.  I would rather get a girlie mag for excitement.  Definatly not for kids.  I must say though, this is the first game I put down in one day.  I gave Batman and Robin a 3 day chance before I put that one down.	-1
Well, It seems that you can't trust Konami. They come out with great games like Metal Gear Solid, but also produce [junk] like this. The demo disc, well it's worth it, but you can buy the game now. The gameplay is horrible. It's just a giant robot collding into other robots in order for them to explode. WOW! And that awful awful AWFUL soundtrack.[Bad] techno with a singer who's genitals were ripped open by fishing knives. The voice acting [stunk], espicially Leo...Bad game. Don't waste your time.	-1
once you end it youll never play it again , just the first part of soulreaver its "half a game" we as the consumer should sue them for making 50 % not 100 % percent of a game .	-1
There's good news and bad news with Z.O.E.  The good news is that MGS2 will be the greatest game ever.  Heck, the extremely short demo packed with Z.O.E. is currently the greatest game ever!  The control is a dream, the graphics are poetry in motion, and the re-playbility is unheard of.  When Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty rolls around, the PS2 will be THE place to be.  That's the good news. The bad news is that Z.O.E. is none of the things MGS2 is.  The story is melodramatic, the voice acting is horrendus, and Leo is the most unlikeable hero in video gaming history.  The graphics are good and there is a great attention to detail, but there is no variety.  Every level has Leo's bot simply destroying the same three enemy bots and the occasional boss.  The control is excellent, but this game is ultimately just NO FUN.  The selection of weapons is sub-standard and fighting through level after level of the same old thing is down right boring.  Finally, for a game with a rating of "M", Z.O.E. should have had a more mature storyline.  The main characters are pre-teens with incredibly annoying, horribly high voices.  Z.O.E. is like a bad episode of Digimon or Power Rangers.  Don't let the good graphics fool you, this is a horrible disappointment of a game.  Buy it for the excellent MGS2 demo, or save your money or a video game that's fun, because Z.O.E. is NOT!	-1
.... It took me many days to get my joystick to work with this program. Yet, you still need to use the keyboard when you want to slow down, use the breaks, and release the landing gear. I flew a little and it made my head spin. Some years ago I would recover from my dizziness and would go right on playing. But now it is just not fun anymore. This program does not make me forget that it is computer-generated planes I am trying to shoot down. When you see the real planes the program is attempting to simulate, even if it is just on TV, you will always think about how pale this electronic imitation really is. .... Still, strategy games of war are fun for me, while this is an exercise in getting dizzy and disoriented.	-1
First I want to say that I am a huge baseball fan, and that WSB 2K1 was completely underrated and 2K2 is equally overrated. 2K1 had hands down the BEST GRAPHICS I've ever seen in a sports game. The pitching and batting of all players was right on the money, a perfect 10. Full motion, breaking pitches looked so sharp, you could even see the seams! While the fielding was automatic, the plays looked realistic and had full motion and extreme detail. The editor was fabulous too, although I wouldn't mind changing the height and weight too! It's wrong to call 2K1 a failure (an example of failure would be all 3 baseball games on PS2), because if only the fielding were changed to manual, that would have been the greatest game of all time. Meanwhile in 2K2, I lost hope. To start, the graphics aren't even close to 2K1, pitching and batting motion is strange, even cartoon like. Also, pitches don't break AT ALL- a fastball looks just like a screwball. Batting stances aren't correct (especially Bonds), and balls outside the strike zone are still strikes. To continue, yes, you have manual fielding, but a normal 6-4-3 double play is almost impossible, because it seems as though everyone is as fast as Maurice Green. Plus the fielders dive way too far, but at least they can jump. To add to that, the editor is [weak] too. You can't even change the faces, pitching stance, or batting stance, so it's all a clone team. Then to top that off, as the GM (who's suppose to have control) can't even trade half the people you want to because of NO TRADE contracts. That's poor. Hitting is far too difficult, and in 2 player mode, you can't even hide your pitch. The only pluses I can give are exceptional commentary, online play, and home run derby. This game needs much improvement.	-1
Well, let me start out the review by revealing that I'm one of the many twenty-something year old SpongeBob fans out there.  So when I saw there was a SpongeBob game for Gameboy Color, I just had to check it out.  What followed was almost a throwback to the old NES days of mediocre 1-hour games that dragged things out through mundane repetition and frustrating difficulty. On the good side, the graphics are colorful and do a decent job of representing the look of the show.  You also get to talk to various characters from the show (although the extent of the conversation is usually just a one-sentence comment).  Unfortunately, the decent job of creating a SpongeBob look/feel is about the only good thing THQ managed to pull off here. The gameplay is..well..rather poor.  It boils down to standard platform gaming with fairly stiff controls.  Usually, the levels scroll upwards or to the right, leaving you to jump from platform to platform while dodging and/or attacking enemies until you simply reach the end of the level.  Platform jumping can be a nightmare as the screen will often scroll past moving platforms in mid-jump, leaving you trying to blindly guess where the platform is so you can attempt to land on it.  Fighting enemies isn't much better.  Despite several different weapons, some enemies are hard to kill (often due to sluggish controls), and getting hit is often unavoidable (usually knocking you off a platform and sending you hurling back to the bottom of the level so you get to experience the dull repetition of ascending the whole area over again).  You can also only get hit twice, meaning you'll find yourself dying often despite the plentiful supply of healing items (extra pants) found in each level.  In short, the areas themselves are boring and repetitive, the gameplay is frustrating, and you're usually forced to play the levels again and again until you manage to survive.  Of course, there are a few bosses thrown into the mix, but they aren't exactly noteworthy and do little to add value to the gameplay. So why did they make game so tough and frustrating?  Well, it appears to be an attempt to drag out what is actually a rather short game.  I'd say there are only about half a dozen short levels (hard to count since everything is sort of connected as one area), which probably took me somewhere between 1 and 2 hours to complete even with all of the repetition. Well, the bottom line is that SpongeBob fans might want to cautiously check it out, but they shouldn't expect too much.  Younger gamers will probably find the game too repetitive, difficult, and frustrating to hold their attention.  Older gamers will probably find it dull, repetitive, frustrating, and short.  Overall, the game does an extremely poor job of capturing the fun that most fans would expect from the SpongeBob license.	-1
If you already own part one (like I have ) then don't expect to be blown away by part 2. The arena is a similar "city" setting, with no time differential. You're still driving during daylight. You can not drive at night. So the only difference is the fact that your car can jump. My biggest complaint is about the mini games. In order to unlock the hidden stages, and scecret characters from part one, you are forced to play the mini games, which are VERY...VERY...VERY!!! difficult to beat. Why didn't the progamers include easy button entry codes, like they do with other games? I like challenges but why should I spend 4 hours trying to get my car to jump from one rooftop to another.	-1
I bought this game from the "bargain bin" not realizing that there was a DVD version of the game - in the long run it probably would not have made a difference. With the CD-ROM details are fuzzy. I'm sure this game is beautiful with the DVD version since there are some spectacular colors even on the CD-ROM. In any case, this does not take away from the fact that I loathed this game.  In Schizm there are two characters - Sam and Hannah. At times you play Sam, other times Hannah. One of the difficulties is knowing who to play when. As we all know, there is a lot of running around in adventure games. That's just the nature of the genre and true to form, there's a lot of back and forth to various locations. That's OK but sometimes you have to do this with both characters - the exact same locations, essentially repeating all that running around. But that wasn't what did me in.  What did me in were the puzzles. I'm not big on puzzles that don't seem to have any relation to the story. In other words, finding clues, putting them together and solving the puzzle. No - some of these were random puzzles. Just keep on plugging in numbers over and over again until you come up with the right combination. The puzzle that truly tried my sanity was a maze-type puzzle - basically finding a route from one place to another while the game blocks your moves eventually cutting you off from reaching the end. The puzzle is random so it's a new route everytime. It's not as easy as it sounds. I probably attempted this puzzle 30-40 times until I got it right. But guess what...you don't have to do this one time, but twice and you have to get it right two times in a row. One walkthrough (I had to use three different ones) stated that if you kept track of your moves on the first successful attempt all you had to do was repeat the results on the second try - nope. Oh but guess what??? Once you are successful with this puzzle, you get to go to another location and do the exact same puzzle again. Sorry - not me. That's when I quit. I was able to finished 3/4 of this horrible game but I just couldn't go on.  I would only recommend this game if you are some kind of masochist.	-1
This might have been a great game: if it had been released about six years ago.  This game is a Myst clone that came out about five years too late.  "Clone" is a bit too much of a compliment.  ... is a slightly better phrase, because this game falls short of the excellent series that it aspires to be. The graphics for the game are simply awful.  The screen looks like a drenched comic book that just got pulled out of the gutter.  Perhaps it is because the game is fixed at 640X480 resolution when most computers can go way higher.  It looks like some effort was put into the artwork for the game, but it is spoiled by the smeared-out, grainy look that occupies every screen.  "Riven" is much older and looks better.  So does "Grim Fandango".  The voice acting is abominable, and so is the acting for the game's in-game movies.  I thought that we got rid of those years ago when everyone realized how cheesy they were. If the game had a good premise, then the poor production values wouldn't matter very much, but it doesn't.  It's another "abandoned world full of weird machines" game.  This time, it's an alien world.  A good puzzle game has to have puzzles that fit into the virtual world.  Unfortunately, "Schizm" has lots of contrived puzzles that don't make sense.  Want to walk across a bridge?  Figure out how to push a series of 20 buttons in the right order.  Don't expect to just push one button.  Apparently, aliens are extremely bored geniuses who have nothing better to do than build complicated contraptions that confuse Earthling scientists.  I wonder if aliens have to push a series of color-coded buttons in a special order to operate a toothbrush. I'll give the game props for having good music and, yes, the puzzles are very difficult.  If you are up for a challenge, they will definitely do that.  It's hard to get interested in them though, since the game always constrains you along a tight path instead of letting you explore a 3D world.  That's another big fault that this game has when you compare it to other adventure games.  Here's a tip:  skip this one unless you have played all other adventure games that you want to play first.  I played "Myst", "Riven", "Sanitarium", and the "Syberia" demo, and they are all better than "Schizm".	-1
This is a comic book.  With too much plot.  Endless pages of text dialog you must scroll through before getting to even a very short action sequence.  Even the action is dull and has too much dialog.  After a while, I quit reading and just kept pushing the buttons to get through the text and get to some action. If you're looking for action - look elsewhere.	-1
This is an absolutely horrible game.  The first thing you notice, though fairly trivial, is that the graphics are bad.  There's no changing the resolution or the color depth, so it runs at what appears to be 640x480 or something with a very low color depth.  Everything's grainy with banding due to lack of color. The next biggest problem is that the navigation is terrible.  You move forward by clicking when you randomly pass the cursor over the right spot and the cursor turn to the right shape.  But, to turn, you either have to use the cursor keys (which do an instantaneous turn instead of a pan, so it's hard to hold an image in your head of where you are), or you click and PUSH the mouse in the direction you want to turn instead of clicking and dragging the window in that direction (and the pan is so fast you can't see the scenery go by).  There's no cursor change in those cases.  Then, if you can look up or down, the only indication you have is a change to an icon down below the scene in your inventory.  Plus, the cursor shape indicating a possible path is very easy to confuse as to where it's really pointing.  In some cases, clicking forward will turn you 45 degrees before proceeding to take you somewhere nowhere near where it looked like it would take you.  In other cases, you think it's pointing somewhere you've been, but it's not (so you miss a path).  You end up watching the cursor and thinking about the mechanics of movement instead of looking at the scenery and tying to figure out what's going on.  Also irritating is that once you click to go forward, it will stop at multiple, non-significant spots (even on straight, non-divertable paths).  So, you spend time sweeping the cursor over everything in every direction wondering what's so important that the game stopped you here. But, the biggest problem is the puzzles themselves.  The charitable description would be that they're impossibly hard.  A more accurate description is that there's neither rhyme nor reason to them.  In some cases, there's no indication that a device IS a puzzle and not just a static display.  If you don't have a necessary inventory item, you can't do anything and there's no indication that you could EVER do anything in it.  If you have some random inventory item that it expects, it just changes the cursor in the right place (if you happen to cross the spot) and you drop it on.  In others, the puzzle is so vague that you're not even sure what you're supposed to be doing with it or why.  Then you have to work your way through multiple, non-easily-written notation systems or phonetics.  In my case, I uninstalled the game when it became obvious that it wanted me to reproduce some long string of barely heard, non-phonetically-writeable, background-noise-filled, alien speech on a set of devices strewn in four or six places about a very large room. Impossible.  Not fun in the least.  Do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this game.	-1
If Einstein is on you cellphone's "friend" list, then you will have fun with this game.  "Schizm" has a "I think I heard this one before" story plot.  Alas! I do recall.  Remember "Aliens", the movie, where the colony is mysteriously empty... The one where we send people to look for them, and they disappear too? So what do we do? SEND MORE! Yup, except for the excitement of aliens, you basically have the premise of "Schizm's" storyline.  An empty planet-nobody around.  "Schizm" IS beautiful.  Remember when "Myst" came out and following it's success, every company released their own version of the game?  Well, this is the latest. At least in "Myst's" defense, the puzzzles were well-thought through, made sense, and you got that great feeling in your tummy when you solved a major task.  Forget it with this game.  Only original concept: You actually play with two players..each landed at a different destination in the beginning storyline.  You can switch back and forth between them.  In order to solve many of the puzzles, you have to use the knowledge between the two players to complete each puzzle. If you are armed with a degree in Math and Engineering, you will work your way to the lousy ending.  Not so fortunate? Join the other 90 percent of Schizm's players who admit they needed a walkthrough or a website with hints.  Pass on this, unless you feel good about yourself incessantly cheating and feeling no reward for accomplishing a difficult game.  I promise, there are better ones out there.  A great anonymous quote I read online: "After playing this game, even the word "Schizm" gave me irritable goosebumps."  To be fair, if I could, I would give it 2 1/2stars. I know there are people out there who love the ultimate challenge...If you are one of those people who never gets bored with impossible, countless, and meaningless puzzles...this could be the one for you.	-1
Schizm is a beautiful game, but not without its problems. First of all, its navigation is cumbersome. Unlike other adventuregames of today, it does not allow 360 degrees movement, wich is a bit of a let down. The movement by mouse is tricky, and often irritating - you can't stop the movement in time. Freezing is frequent, saving every two minutes imperative. The storyline reminds (to say the least) a lot of other games in this genre, especially The Journeyman Project 3, by Presto. I would say, it's almost identical. And then there's the graphics, wich, at least on cd-rom, are not quite the quality I've come to expect, having played Exile and Riven. The puzzles defy logic. I would say the're undoable without hints, nudges and pushes, or even een detailed walkthrough in times. That said, Schizm has a beautiful atmosphere, great music and superb sounds. The different worlds are stunning, although, again, a lot has been borrowed if not copied from either Riven/Exile or real life (Gaudi's architecture, for example.) Is it worth the money? Yes, well, maybe. But be ready for some major irritations and resorting to walkthroughs.	-1
At least in Riven (which I also grew tired of), there was a sense of "being there," of exploring a mysterious, beautifully detailed world.  I bought the CD version of Schizm, which was the only version for sale at Best Buy, dutifully loaded all 5 CD's, and was appalled at the low quality of the video. No sense of reality, no immersion. I KNEW I should've bought Myst 3, dang it.  But the truth is, the puzzles in this "game" are what I'd expect to find in a newstand puzzle magazine.  And I don't find those interesting, either.  I'm a programmer, and I live to solve logic problems.  So why don't I like Schizm? Because, based on the game's own description of itself, I was hoping that it would be more of an adventure, filled with discovery, wonder, and mystery.  As if you were truly stranded on an alien world and trying to figure things out.  The only game I've played like that is Thief II, which is WONDERFUL.  You interact, you figure things out, you knock a few guys out here and there with a blackjack, and meanwhile a great story develops, PAINLESSLY.  I can't wait for Thief III to come out... This game was nothing more than an interactive screensaver wrapped around some lame puzzles.  Very disappointing. This is the second Dreamcatcher title I've bought.  The other was Cydonia (now called Lightbringer, probably to throw people off the track who have read bad reviews of Cydonia).  Lesson learned: if it says Dreamcatcher, avoid it all costs.	-1

A great way to waste [...], or how about [...].  This game has little to no graphics, gameplay is nothing anyone should want, it lags all the time, even in story (hows that supposed to work, don't ask me), and the only good thing about it is that you can outfit your character.  Cons:  Almost Everything  Pros:  The Outfitter	-1
Never thought I'd complain about a video game being too realistic but after watching my son play this after he'd played it enough to become very proficient at it I was taken aback by the realism of the game in the way the soldiers looked and moved and the weapons they used and how exciting it could be to hunt the 'enemy' and gun them down.  The real trouble in my opinion, and why I threw the game away, was because it was very realistic when it came to the chase, battle scenes, and the kill rate, often at point blank range but not when it came to the actual results of combat and the effects of the various, highly effective killing weapons used. There were no soldiers screaming in agony because they were shot in the stomach, or had their legs blown off, or shot in the face or writhing in pain in an open courtyard as they bled out and finally stopped screaming for help. They make the weapons and soldiers realistic but the part of war and battle that sane men, brave men, patriots and soldiers hate, the suffering that goes with it, they conveniently leave out. I understand of course, they're trying to sell games but I don't like that killing is becoming a very realistic "game". They've made it so it's not really connected to killing human beings - they're just targets and all of them drop dead quickly, neatly, and quietly - nothing realistic about that at all.	-1
This one of the worst games I have purchased for my computer. (I have well over 500.) 1. The tutorial is worthless. It tells you to perform a certain function, but it doesn't tell you how to do it or why to do it. 2. The manual, although chock full of information, is terrible. I guess it would be OK if you are using it as resource material for a Masters Thesis in History. All in all I have to say I've wasted my $40, but hey, it'll make a nice coaster for my beer glass.	-1
Perhaps I'm just not enough of "hard core" gamer, but I foudn this game too difficult to be enjoyable.  While I enjoyed building and advancing my civilization, there's just no way to avoid doing battle and play a simply economic game. So, about the time I get a wonder built or a couple started the AI kicks in and stomps the bejeezus out of me.  I've had the game for a year - even bought the strategy guide - and I've yet to play complete a scenario succesfully, and this is while playing on the easiest setting.  Perhaps I'm more used to simulation/city-building games than RTS games, but it seems to me that for the game to be enjoyable the average use ought to have at least a reasonable chance at success. Technically, graphically, it's a great game.  No complaints there, but the level of difficulty makes me unlikely to want to continue playing.	-1
'Empire Earth' isn't the EASIEST game to learn. It actually has a high learning curve. And it doesn't look that GREAT. But there's something about it. All these different epochs you can play in. It is worth checking out now if you can find it in a bargain bin.	-1
This game was too ambitious.  By including so many ages, it spread itself to thin to greatly capture the essense of any particular age.  The economy design is a stripped down version of Age of Empires, and it remains the same throughout every age.  This game will be fun for kids, but the build build, build, attack, attack, attack game has gotten really old with me. My rating may be biased because I prefer turn based strategy games.  I just found this game to be kinda boring.	-1
This game has so much potential, but it is filled with fatal bugs and no patches have yet been announced to fix them.  It constantly seizes and freezes, forcing you to reboot your whole system each time so saving often is key.  However, in one hour of gaming, it froze 5 times on me, making it hardly an enjoyable experience.  It is a shame that it does this, for it looks like it will be better than AOK.  Nevertheless, the constant reboots are infuriating and will make me question ever buying a game from this company until I see the patches are out. For those who wonder... I have a 700 Mhz Athlon with the latest 3dFX and 128 Mgs of ram.  It is less than year old and is able to easily handle such games as Baldur's Gate II, Deus Ex and Mech Warrior 4.  Hence,  I can only blame the game.	-1
I've played and liked (and usually loved) every Sid Meier game. This one is not on the same page as CIV, etc. poor graphics poor balance absolutely horrid game play This is one annoying stinker. This is one of the rare games that makes me wish that I could return software.	-1
The only reason I play this game is because it's pretty addictive; however, it has many flaws:  The music is extremely annoying, the sound effects aren't at all notable, you hardly get any points for clearing viruses, you get no points for just matching 4 regular pieces, and the graphics on this game are no different from the regular Nintendo.  Come on; this is supposed to be a newer and better game system!  They made Super Mario 64 look a lot different and better from the original, so why couldn't they have improved this game?	-1
This game is Exactly like Tetris! So don't get this game.	-1
Frogger was a great game on my old computer.  the problem with this game is it is not compatible with the newer versions of Windows.  I don't know who well it would work with virtual PC but i don't think that is made for games anyway.  if you kept your old pc around by all means give this a try	-1
I don't like Frogger.  Never have.  This version was received to me as a Christmas gift (gee, I seem to say that in EVERY one of my reviews!) and I hate how difficult it is.  Yes, the difficulty lies in maneuvering, but it's *really* hard.  Even the very first level (the street level) is pretty tough.  Finally reaching and failing the cloud level (over and over again) is when I finally said "no more!" and pulled the game from the computer.  This was 5 years ago and I'm still happy about the decision.	-1
This game was not what I thought. I saw the picture of the cover to this game and thought it was like maybe Star Wars or something. I was suprised it was not even close in more ways to comment on in this review. Some may like this game so I won't trash it. Just 2 stars!!!	-1
I got this game in hopes of a good adventure. Instead i got terrible controls, command problems, poorest where the enemy is and whom the enemy is tracking i've ever experinced in any game. Communication, ship functions, and user friendliness were shot to hell! Definitely DO NOT buy this game unless you have 4 arms and are masochistic.	-1
three hours after i bought this game i had beaten every stage. i like to focus on the positive, so i will say the colors and graphics, though cartoonish, are eyecatching. other than that its not much more positive about it. i believe if it cost maybe $15 or less, i would feel better about it. i believe if you spend $40 on this, when you play it you are going to be upset. unless you have 40 bucks to throw away. nice simple fighting game, yes. worth 40 dollars, not even close.	-1
I think I bought this purely out of some nostalgic sense of duty, as the professional review I'd read of it was unflattering.  I should have listened to the pros on this one.  This game presents nothing new to anyone who's played a Darkstalkers game in the past, the graphics definitely don't come close to other titles available for the PSP (which tells me the developers don't even care about this product), and some of the button combos that you are required to punch through are near impossible to accomplish.  All in all, the only challenge I got from playing this game was to get the characters to do their more advanced moves, but even without them I could still win through and beat the game.  Total waste of hard earned money.	-1
Lets be honest here, I have been playing fighting games since Street Fighter was released in the arcades, and I am talking about the first one in the mid 1980s. Then of course the titanic Street Fighter 2 came out and changed the face of fighting games forever in around 1991. Well anyways it introduced a system of special moves that required fancy joystick movements and a series of button presses to pull off. The fighting genre was nothing but punches and kicks until SF2 came out. Well after the success of SF2 CAPCOM made Darkstalkers (Vampire Savior in Japan), which fused those special moves with over the top monsters from hollywood films like the wolfman, mummy, etc. with that special CAPCOM styling. It is an awesome series and in some ways I like it much better than SF2. But herein lies the problem with the PSP treatment, as much as I try to love this game for the rare gem it is, I can't. The control system was not tweeked enough back at CAPCOM to make it function properly with the PSP digital pad (directional pad), and thus we are left with essentially a button mashing mess. I am sure some will be unable to see past this flaw but when you are talking abut taking out the very foundation of a game series, in this case special moves, then you are left with a shell of what could have been the best 2D fighter ever released on a handheld system. It pains me to say that but it is true and I think if your honest with yourself you will appreciate that I hate it that this game didn't turn out well because of something so fundamental. CAPCOM please be wary next time!	-1
This game will run on Windows 95 but with the release of Windows 2000 and XP the game has to be put to sleep.  Infogrames Entertainment has to come out with an updated version for the newer OS's and computers. This is a 19th Century game still being sold in the 21st Century.	-1
I'm good at puzzle games and I like them. But this is too hard. Getting 1 sword will be hard for beginners or any gamers. You must have to have the Stragety Guide memorized in your brain to beat this. You should not ever get a Zelda game(unless you're up for the challenge). Don't get this.	-1
I played this game back in 2005 when GameStop used to carry classic games, and needless to say, the intense frustration of this game is burned into my mind forever. I liked it at first, but when I realized how much better the controls are from Super Castlevania IV to the present games its difficult to look at the first one the same way ever again. The controls are extremely unforgiving, and Simon can plunge into his doom from something as simple as the stairs. Just like the third Castlevania game, you have to be perfect when platforming from block to block and not try to do something as simple as wanting to jump the opposite direction at the last second only to fall into a water pit. This was later remade as Super Castlevania IV for a very, very good reason. It does the first title justice with the far superior controls, and even has a nice bonus of improved graphics, and music, though it was always the controls that bothered me, and  lot of that. If you want a classic Castlevania game without smashing your TV, or having your blood pressure run into unhealthy numbers, please go for the fourth one on the SNES, which is also on the Wii and Wii U eShop. Please avoid the first three games, they will make you bitter!!	-1
I got this for my collection of NES & SNES games, but this is awful! The graphics are terrible (yes, I know this is 1980 NES game), Simon has no face. The first few stages were fun, until I got to the first boss: An ugly bat who was impossible to attack with your whip. After a week of practice, I defeated it and moved on to part #2. This is where the bad controls start to ruin it. Every time an enemy hit me, Simon would bounce backwards to his doom. I gave up after that.	-1
Came broken	-1
This game is the worst of the three. Messy, aweful games, and same characters. DON'T BUY!	-1
Wtf I did not buy this just wondering how you people spent 1500 dollars on a child hood memory	-1
This is a game that will have a huge following with some gamers, but most with hate it just for it's genre and not give it a chance.  There are many great things about this game, but to me there are just too many bad things. In the good catagory monkey island has great graphics.  To me it kinda looks like toy story or such.  Cool cgi animation.  There is a lot of humor as you control the sometimes very ignorant hero on his many adventure (or complacated trips for his wife).  There is also a TON of exploring to do and at every turn there is another puzzle to keep the story moving, and to me this is one of the main problems with this game. The puzzles are sometimes things you would never think of.  Some of his escapes from various traps etc. are very much like mcgyver, and took me a long time to piece them together, but that may just be me.  For most people including me a guide may be a needed, not option thing.  I'm far from stupid but some of the puzzles just aren't at all obvious.  The controls at times can also be a problem, it takes alot of time to move around many areas and can be a real pain running back and forth.  The almost constant loading times are also a problem, whenever dialogue is going on the game is jerky, same with movies, and sometimes the smallest little scene needs a load time. To me this game shows why this genre of games will never be as popular as the gran turismo's and resident evils.  If you have alot of patience and a lot of time this game may be for you, but for me i'll stick to gt 3 for now.  At least rent before you buy.	-1
Super Mario Kart tended to dominate the N64 as the best multiplayer game.  So I've been waiting and watching the kart racing games for the PS2 hoping to find one that will give the same level of fun.  Unfortunately, Super Bombad Racer falls short. Remember that kart-racing games are suppose to be fun and childish, so the cartoonish characters with large heads and silly taunts are up the right alley.  The large number of special items (forward weapons, backward weapons, boosts, shields, etc.) adds a good level of playability to the game, unfortunately with a bunch of racers everyone is shooting everyone all the time and there's no real strategy involved. The controls for the game are also very loose.  It takes a lot of getting used to as you bounce all over the place and can't make the tight turns you'd like to.  The levels are relatively simple and there's not a lot you can do to improve your racing ability on them. You'll probably play through all 9 nine of the levels in about an hour and then wonder what you're suppose to do.  The game quickly looses its enjoyment in single player mode.  Luckily there's multi-player mode to come to the rescue and this game is good fun with a bunch of people.  Still, I've found after running through the levels a couple times with friends, there's just not a lot of joy to it. Even battle mode has issues.  With so many hit-you-from-across-the-screen-automatically weapons there isn't much skill required.  You just need to know where on the level the good weapons can be found and hope your opponents don't.  And on some levels, Yoda-who can damage everyone with his special item-can just sit out of the way and slowly take everyone out. Overall, this is a fun game for a little while, but is likely to sit on your shelf except when you have friends over.  It's probably better to save your money and wait for that great kart-racing game to come out for the PS2.	-1
Luckily, I rented this before deciding whether or not to buy.  And boy am I lucky that I tried it before dropping $50 for it. Well, everyone knows about the concept and cool graphics and all.  The game suffered no slow down even with multi-tap on.  But after playing for a short time, I realized how bad this game is.  The controls are difficult, the power-ups are useless in a race (you need to use shortcuts to win).  And worse, the carts move way too slow.  The fun of any cart racing (ala Mario Kart or even Rumble Racing ) is that it's fast.  This game felt like I was moving at snail pace. I wish that they would put Mario Kart on PS2 (though never happen) or someone come up with a true kart game.  The closest out right now is Rumble Racing which is definitely worth the look if you're looking for cart racing type game.	-1
This is by far THE worst game I have ever played on any system.  I don't see how anyone could think this game is fun.  The graphics are not good, the map would be better off not even there, and the glitches in the game should not even be an issue...but they are, besides the fact that the game freezes up, running into objects is annoying enough to make you want to snap your controller in half.  Please don't anyone buy this game, and hope that they don't try to waste anyone's time with a sequel.	-1
I picked this game up because it was cheap and happened to be one of the few adventure games I didn't already own.  It was a waste money.  This most awful computer game I've ever played.  The storyline is boring and confusing and the graphics and voice acting are terrible.  It's an excruciatingly slow game to get through, not because it's hard, but because it takes forever to get from point A to point B and then you have to listen to some awful dialogue for a while.  The puzzle I had the most problem with in the game was the one where you had to light torches in a dark tunnel.  You can't go on to the next stretch of tunnel until you light the torch in that area, and it's impossible to see anything.  I was reduced to searching the screen with my cursor until I could find a spot where the game would allow me to use my matches.  It wasn't hard to figure out what I had to do, but actually doing it was another matter.  Save youself the frusteration and boredom and buy some other game.  Whatever else you might get, it'll probably be better than this game.  If it's worse, you have my sympathy.	-1
I can;t rate this at any stars for it fails to run at all on my computer. i blame my computer as it has windows 7. THE POOREST OPERATING SYSTEM I HAVE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING STUCK WITH	-1
Would not play on my PC because of outdated driver. Microsoft no longer supports this simulator or its driver. Nor does its manufacturer.	-1
Had to return the disc said not located on my computer but i like trains.	-1
It is fun the first hour or so after you buy then it gets boring. It has realy dumb features, and doesnt teach anything you ever need to know. The lessons are way to slow, and boring, the game is all boring in a mater of fact it is so boring it is boring thinking about it. It probaly could have been beter, but microsoft made a good decisian to work more on Flight sim and perfect it which they pretty much have and gave up on dumb train simulator. I wouldnt waste the money to buy this game.	-1
As a huge fan of Microsoft software, I regret to say this is the lowest quality ever sold by them.  Microsoft even skimped on the software packaging.  Just a cheap CD envelope and brochure type key card.  The software has a somewhat unfinished feel to it.  The scenery and models are extremely simple and plain.  I attempted 2 installations with this software, and my computer has not been the same since.  I strongly urge anyone to wait for a few versions to come before paying for Train Simulator. If this were any item other than software, it would go right back to the store to be returned.  For Microsoft, Shame on you!  I am now a skeptical Microsoft buyer.  -Long Live Quality!	-1
One of the first things you do when you begin serious development of a general-market software product: consider the system configurations that it could work with and make it compatible with as many of those as possible without sacrificing tons of features. That isn't how Microsoft did things though when creating the Train Simulator software. This product just won't run on my relatively new PC -- which was designed for high performance gaming.  Even after repeated attempts to work with Microsoft Support, no luck. And after hearing and reading several other users' difficulties, I'm convinced that Microsoft made some basic mistakes on the development of this product. Despite their claims to have designed this for a wider audience than the hardcore gamer, Microsoft has released a product that does require more configuration twiddling than should be performed when installing a PC game. And purchase of a new video or sound card shouldn't be a requirement for getting a product like this to work either. It is a shame too.  Because this simulator seems to have so much to offer. I was really hoping to have hours of fun with this...but I'll have to wait for a more robust product from someone else.	-1
At a glance, Strikers 1945 bears a definite resemblance to the Giga Wing games for the Sega Dreamcast.  Those two shooters aren't exactly what I would call masterpieces, but they're still better than this game.  Strikers 1945 has enough to keep hardcore twitch gamers happy for a very short time.  Then, its shortcomings overshadow its merits.  On the plus side, there's a good selection of planes to choose from, each with different weapons and abilities, slowdown is minimal, and the game is very much "old school"...maybe TOO old.  The music and sound effects are incredibly bland and the graphics are inferior to those of  many older games.  Gameplay is, always has been, and always will be the single most important factor in a video game, but in this day and age, I really don't think some extra bells and whistles and a bit of spit polish are too much to ask for.  Strikers 1945 gets boring in a hurry.  There are a good many 2-D shooters out there...both side-scrolling and vertical-scrolling...that surpass this game on many levels.  Einhander, Bangai-O, Thunder Force V, Silpheed: The Lost Planet, and more.  Seek them out and leave this one behind.	-1
Don't get me wrong I love trains, but I think that this game is just terrible.  The graphics are merely ok, nothing amazing.  Microsoft in my opinion tried to make this game way to realistic, where it goes beyond fun and becomes a job.  Also TS  gets so boring and dull after about 20-30 minutes that you will most likely wish to return it.  Overal, the game in MY OPINION is a disaster, but if you are a HARD CORE SIM FAN maybe you will enjoy MTS.	-1
This game was enjoyable for the first two hours and then its fun factor quickly went down hill. It is far too complicated to figure out the right combination of car, color, license plate, etc that is needed to race the different groups. For Japanese street racing geeks that is probably their idea of great fun, but it's not mine. I regret buying this game.	-1
This game isn't very good. You get two boards of Kiss themed pinball. The worst part of this game is the ball control. The balls drop much too fast, making it hard to get any control. You basicly spend the whole game just flipping the flippers in hopes you'll hit the ball before it quickly drops to the bottom screen and past your flippers. The sound isn't very good either. Not much in the way of Kiss songs or sound effects. The manual even tells you to put your favorite Kiss CD in the playstation after the games loads. Don't confuse this game with an old favorite of mine for the Sega Genesis, Crue Ball, based on Motley Crue. That pinball game was great. I guess you get what you pay for and this game may be worth [the money]for a few rounds of pinball.	-1
Wasn't new at all, had a few scratches on the screen, was dirty and worn. Buyer beware!	-1

Now I myself personally love me some Super Mario. If you checked my reviews, you'll see that I've given&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Super-Mario-Advance-4-Super-Mario-Bros-3/dp/B00009WAUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros 3</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Super-Mario-World-Super-Mario-Advance/dp/B00005UK88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance</a>&nbsp;all high ratings. When I purchased those two games, I've noticed that Nintendo made some changes with those games since the last time I've owned them on Super Nintendo. So here I am with Super Mario Advance, which is Super Mario 2 on Game Boy Advance, and I have to say that I've not impressed at all with this one. I understand that video games "evolve" over time and creaters try to make them better, but there is a difference between making the game better than the origonal, and making it complicated than the origonal. Nintendo did the latter with this game.  Changes for the good are nice for me. On this one you can pick you character each time you die (actually you could do that since the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Super-Mario-All-Stars/dp/B000050FBJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Super Mario All-Stars</a>&nbsp;game, and I didn't know you couldn't do that on the origonal NES game until I was playing my cousin's Wii a few days ago). Also it tells you each characters power under them on the select screen. Another helpful change is when you collect the star which makes you become invincible for a few seconds. Back then when you collect a certain amount of cherries, a star would just randomly float from the bottom of the screen. On here you'll hear some kind of tone which warns you the star is comming.  Not so good changes are very visible. First of all, what got me was during the beginning of the game, there is a long drop before you reach the bottom and start. They changed that too, which sucks. Also on the origonal game you started off big (the status you are when you have at least two hearts on the left side of the screen). Here you're small (with one heart on the left side), which really isn't a problem because you can find hearts anywhere to make you grow. Back then if you kill enough enemies, a heart will float from the ground and you gain more life. Here, hearts are inside the plants you pick up from the ground and sitting idle in high places on levels. And what really ticks me off is the red shell that you can pick up from the ground. Back then you threw the red shell at an enemie and it would have hit the wall and dissapeared. Here if you throw a shell, it will bounce off the wall and keep going, and if it hits you, you loose a heart or die (come on now!). And whats the deal with those huge Shy Guys and Turnip Plants? And like every Mario game, the characters speak (Peach doesn't know when to shut up). Hell even Birdo speaks (that purple dinosaur that shoot out eggs), and half the time I don't even knows what she is saying.  There you have it with Super Mario 2 on Game Boy Advance. What I believed happened was that Nintendo received feedback since 1993 when this game was reissued on SNES on how difficult the game was and tried their best to make it easier and more fun for new and younger Nintendo gamers, because I played the origonal on the Wii and it was the exact version on the NES and it was way harder. Older guys like me will definately find this game flawed if you've had it in different formats. Nintendo has made some great reissues with great modifications, but they shot a brick with this one big time. Peace.  P.S.- The Arcade game appears on all Super Mario Advance games.	-1
This game is a big disappointment from Nintendo.  First off, the original game wasn't all that great to begin with due to its tiny worlds, nonexistant powerups, and simple boss characters.  However,  what makes this game a real loser is that it's worse than the the SNES remake on the Super Mario All-Stars game and even the original NES game!  The game does have some advantages over previous versions:  1) The graphics are taken from Super Mario All-Stars and therefore are an improvement over the original.  2) The mindnumbingly boring slot machine scene after each tiny world have been made more tolerable since you can now bet a group of coins instead of making individual bets for each and every coin you have.  3) Like All-Stars, you can pick a different character after each tiny level instead of waiting until an entire world was cleared.  What makes this game worse than All-Stars?  1) The horrible scrolling engine!  SMB2 had a unique scrolling style on vertical levels which remains, but the horizontal levels are torture too.  You can literally tap your character one direction or the other and the entire screen will scroll so that your character is near either the left or right edge.  The scrolling engine alone makes this game unplayable.  What is it with Nintendo and its policy of using lousy camera work for its Mario games?  I thought that was just for their 3D Mario games.  2) The annoying vocal work from the 3D games has been added here to make the experience as unpleasant as possible.  Do we really need to hear "Lucky" after collecting a cherry?  Battle scenes with Birdo have some sort of annoying speech that I haven't made out quite yet, and it freezes the action while the dialog is being spoken.  3) Weird tacked-on stuff: the game has a lot of little new things that just feel totally out of place.  Anyone familiar with the real version of the game is familiar with the inital drop that happens when you start world 1-1.  The new version is totally different and this new little vertical area is littered with everything that will annoy you about this game.  My recommendation?  DO NOT BUY.  Nintendo needs to know that terrible ports like this are totally unacceptable!  I recommend waiting for the Nintendo Revolution (aka the poorly named "Wii") and obtain the NES original or the superior SNES Super Mario All-Stars version on the virtual console instead.	-1
I bought this a few years ago because I sold my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Game-Boy-Advance-SP-Classic-NES-Limited-Edition/dp/B00023JJUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Game Boy Advance SP Classic NES Limited Edition</a>&nbsp;since I bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nintendo-DS-Lite-Onyx-Black/dp/B000I10PY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nintendo DS Lite Onyx Black</a>&nbsp;and later came across some of my old GB Color and Black and White games I thought I lost in a move. This is crap compared to a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Game-Boy-Advance-SP-Classic-NES-Limited-Edition/dp/B00023JJUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Game Boy Advance SP Classic NES Limited Edition</a>&nbsp;system (or any GBA SP). The screen is so dark on this original GBA System, I have to shine several lights on it to see the screen and sometimes the glare of the lights makes it even more difficult to see the screen. Just stick with a DS or an GBASP system to play GBA Games.	-1
The original GBA is an eye-killer because its screen is so dark.  Even though the LCD is active-matrix, you can't see much even under the best lighting conditions.  Get the new SP edition instead; it has built-in frontlight.	-1
This game is the pits! Its the worst Mario game ever. Even worse than Mario 64. Pros: Nice Graphics Cons: Makes you madder than the Mad Hatter! Terrible Gameplay Too hard	-1
super mario advance 2 is better than this,at least it has the classic super mario world which is really awesome but this like balh.  get the 2nd version. youll like it more than this.	-1
Mario is known all over the world by his famous super jump which smashes enemies into the ground. Unfortunelty, this game has no super jumps. You have to throw vegetables to kill your enemies. This is the worst idea for a Mario game. The good thing is that you get to choose from four diffrent characters, Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad, and it includes the amazing Link It Up, which allows four players to play from the same gamepack (Note: you will need the link cable). I just don't like it because they killed the Mario classics. Buy it if you enjoy wasting your money! (in other words, don't buy it)	-1
Elite Force is my favorite first person "shooter." The story and graphics are all top notch and it was a lot of fun to play. When I heard that there was going to be an expansion pack, I got myself ready for another engrossing adventure. Well, I have to say that I was disappointed. It starts out good, though. You get to walk around Voyager without a time limit, which is very cool for Trek fans. You can read up on past missions, read personal logs and even use a replicator. This is nice, but I wanted to make my way to the holodeck to try the new missions. So, I tried the Captain Proton episode. First of all, the black and white graphics are beautiful but that's where the fun ends. You can't save the game during the single player missions but after completing the Proton adventure within 10 minutes without dying, I realized that you don't need to save it. There isn't much challenge to it. Plus, the graphics slowed WAY down in may spots for an unknown reason (is a patch needed?) and I had to walk backwards for a while to remedy the problem. When I finally found "Satan's Robot" and the "girl", it was over before I knew it. The other single player missions are uninspired and dull. A malfunctioned holodeck, shooting range and a Klingon base are all you get and the maps are quite small. However, the additional maps for the holomatches are really good. They are much larger and even more graphically detailed. You also get a wider selection of opponents, including Janeway Borg and Captain Proton. Try out the "Singularity" map. All in all, the Virtual Voyager is nice but there isn't much too it. If you want a good single player mode, try searching the net for MODS. There are some good ones out there! The new holomatches save this from being a total disaster.	-1
This is the third official version of F-Zero. There are hacks claiming to be F-Zero 2, but there are only three games in the series, F-Zero (SNES), F-Zero X (N64), & F-Zero: Maximum Velocity (GBA). F-Zero is a relatively simple concept... it is all about a space race. Each vehicle is equipped with a jet propulsion system and magnetic stabilizers. You race down the tracks at speeds exceeding 600mph. Racers from all over the galaxy come to compete. Once you are on the track, anything goes. Other racers can even push you off the track and to your death. I was rather pleased with the feel of the game. The whirr of the engines was well done for this limited audio power on the GBA.  Collision SFX did lack in the sense that they sounded more like someone sneezing.  The cityscape presented on the  earlier tracks was well preserved from the SNES version. The vehicles have a new take on appearance. These are nicely rendered in 3D when you select your machine, however in game racing uses a very dulled down version of the CG models featured in the vehicle select screen.  The track does spin nicely and appears to have slight usage of a 3D engine. I was disappointed with the actual control of the game. Racing is very difficult to control. It seems the slightest tap will send you ricocheting from wall to wall. This became increasingly annoying when I was trying to place. The recharge ports are also too small to really regain any energy. By the time you are finished being bounced around on the track, you have already passed your chance to recharge. There is definitely a high learning curve in this out of control world. I did not like the game. I enjoyed the first two F-Zero games, F-Zero X more than the original. F-Zero: Maximum Velocity just seems to take more time to learn than I am really willing to put forward. I do not recommend this to newbies of the series. If you have played previous installments, you may find value here, but as for myself, once tossed around, twice shy.	-1
Do not buy this game. Even if you loved this game before, don't buy it. Whenever you jump and land on an object, it feels like your sliding. I got bored of this after an hour. And don't just buy the game to play multiplayer unless you want to spend 6 hours playing that stupid POW game with four people. The singleplayer is boring on that to. I hope Nintendo comes out with Super Mario 3 or even Super Mario World from the SNES. All in all, I can safely say now the only game worth playing my GBA is Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2, other than that, forget it.	-1
This is almost a perfect port of the SNES version of this game that surfaced in the late 80's as a launch title for the SNES/Super Famicom. It gets old quick and tracks all begin to look the same. The ability to do 2-player link off a single cart is the best feature this offers. Mario Kart Advance (also a SNES title) represents a 3rd generation SNES title and was more advanced than FZero in it's day, as a result it's port for the GBA (also a perfect port) is  much better than FZero, so if you want a game like this, I would recommend Mario Kart Advance.	-1
yes when i first got it it was fun and cool and in two days of playing i almost finshed the whole game the only thing i really didn't do was get the last vessel. i don't think you should get  this game instead get mario kart, but if you really want this game get it used! trust me after playing this game for about a week you won't want it! got out and get mario kart instead! i give it a two only because i had fun with it for a few days but now im sick of it!	-1
Spend your money buying a rechargable battery pack/AC adapter from MadCatz,you can charge it up for play on the go or just plug in the adapter for non-moblie play. This product here is just a AC adapter which means you have to be near a wall outlet and light. Using this defeats the purpose of the GBA being portable. Buy the portable rechargable battery pack.	-1
The first arcade version of Crazy Taxi, with its instantly recognizable music and appearance, was an amazingly popular game.  Its concept was simple yet irresistible -- to create a driving game where you don't have to worry about crashes, and where your goal shifts all the time so that it's the equivalent of 30, 40 racing courses.  I was a devotee of this game and had spent hours on it. This PlayStation 2 version lost most of the magic in the translation.  For one thing, inevitably, the controls are just not the same without the steering wheel, pedals, and the all-important gear shift, without which (and without knowing the "boost" move) you could never hope to pick up more than five, six passengers before your time runs out.  The PS2 version, grievously, sped up the game clock so much that the game just blitzes by.  It took me a long time to figure out how fast you have to execute the boost to make it work, and even then, finesse of control flew right out the window.  So the game became what it always threatened to become, a frantic, overly speedy experience fit to give you a heart attack, so fast that there's very little fun factor, just rushing to meet all the times without getting to enjoy anything. So many games these days are about "beating the clock", probably reflective of our ADD-infested culture.  Street Fighter became another flashy, graphics-ridden button masher; Syphon Filter now forces you to run through levels ignoring enemies just to meet their insane "par times", and Crazy Taxi requires the reflexes of a cockroach.  Maybe I'm from an older game culture where you don't have to be on speed to compete.  At any rate, this game was a sore disappointment.  But I know I'll jump onto the next classic Crazy Taxi on my next trip to the arcades and hope it's still there.	-1
There is absolutly no point to this game. I wasted three bucks from renting down at my local video store when i was bored one after noon. This game is the same thing over and over and over again. And theres no point to playing because you cant open anything, its already all open. So save your money and go buy a good game for the same price like Final Fantasy X.	-1
Again, another failed attempt at a racing game. Crazy Taxi gets boring really quickly and then you really have no where else to go and you end up bringing this one to your local Funcoland or Game Stop and trade it in for something else. The graphics are excellent and for the 5 minutes that it lasts, the game is fun but as soon as that 5 minutes is up, I wouldn't count on anything else to expect in this game. When will they come out with a racing game similar to Road Rash? Atleast in Road Rash, there's a lot more competition and you actually have to deal with the elements and environment around you. I can recall several times where I just drove across a park to get where I needed to go. Again, not very fun and an unfortunate thumbs down.	-1
This game is a good bet for kids under the age of 14, and it is a good fast-paced scramble for passengers and money.  The annoying bits are that there is no damage to your taxi when you hit "solid" objects, you cannot mow people down on the street, the missions are all timed, the street surface glitch is EXTREMELY annoying (sometimes the street will completely disappear, looking like glass), and the wannabee Wolfman Jack should look for another means of employment.  The side missions, exp. the long jump, [are] REALLY [bad].	-1
You people rating this game 4 or 5 starts wouldn't know a good game if somebody slapped you in the face with it.  This game is a disgrace, they should have kept it on the almost-extinct Dreamcast.	-1
Now, don't get me wrong, I LOVE this thing. I just bought another one for a good reason. The first time I purchased one on here (listed under "Good" condition), it was filled with cockroaches. Literally, live cockroaches.	-1
i ordered this and waited for what seemed about a week. when i got home i opened it and it was filled with bugs, so my mom put it in a bag, and the next day, there were like 20 dead bugs in there. i would not reccomend buying this.	-1
This game is nothing more then a mindless filler. A second-rate Smackdown vs. Raw ripoff. The story is stupid as heck. The garphics look like they were made by a drunk 4 year old. It's very gimmacky and cartoony to say the least. I give this game a 0 out of 10.	-1
22 Characters? More like 16. And It's not even wrestling, it's smacking each other around with pinning. Don't buy it, it'll only kill your love of the simpsons. It only got a star because the dialouges are funny.	-1
This game is a steaming pile of [...] that stepping in may cost you [...] (luckily it only cost me [...]). The Simpsons and Wrestling are two of the most popular shows on TV today and two of the few shows that i make sure to catch every episode of...every week. Now some marketing genius knows that the PSX is in dire need of a Simpsons title, but they know none of the Simpsons games made under the Acclaim license were really any good except for the immortal Simpsons Arcade game. They figure "Hey, Simpsons, and Pro Wrestling, the kids will love it!" The problem is, any kid in their right mind will not love this. As far as Pro Wrestling goes this is not it at all. Steaming burps, massive weapons coming out of nowhere, jumping 8 feet across a ring. The graphics are downright ugly. The characters look all wavy and messed up. They tried to make a 3D simpsons and wound up with a very 2D-ish cartoony game that wouldn't stand on 16 bit standards. The gameplay is not there, not there at all, button mashing on top of button mashing will not get anything to work in this game, if you rent this without a manual you'll be doubly confused. The sound is not as bad but not good at all, small voice sampling and really really unfunny clips, it's the actual TV show voices but they sound like they've been clipped from episodes and put together for the game. There is no replay value, because it stinks, it's pitiful. I rented this game and i want my [...] back on top of money for all the distress and punitive damages that this game has put upon me. May god have mercy on the souls of the people at Activision who made this stinker (This is the company that made Tony Hawk, Spiderman, and Vigilante 8?). The thing that really irks me is that some of the best games ever have been cartoony takes on sports. Like Punchout and Ready 2 Rumble for boxing fans and Mario Kart for racing fans, so on and so forth. However if you want a wrestling title for your playstation, i recommend Smackdown 2, THQ did a great job with everything except the graphics on it, and the arenas look good, it smacks of fun and replay value. If you want a good simpsons title, email the folks at Activision and tell them to make the Simpsons Racing game for GCN and PS2 not stink.	-1
Who doesn't love the Simpsons? I certainly do!! I watch all their episodes (new and old). And what's not to love about them? They're silly, funny, and witty!! I can't say i'm a big Simpsons fan but i am a fan none the less so when i saw they had a wrestling game for playstation, i said i had to get this game!! Well, like some of the Simpsons episodes, this game was disappointing. it wasn't all that interesting and the wrestling moves, i thought, were limited. and it's a very easy game to beat but then again, some of you might like that. In any case, it was still fun for an unchanllenging game. It was only fun for about 10 minutes. I wouldn't recommend this game at all unless you like simple fighting games. And if you are a Simpsons fan, you'll get it anyway regardless whether the game isn't all that.	-1
I am bias, I must confess, I have been a simpsons fan since I was four years old so I have grown up watching this family and as much as I truly love this show. The conversion of the simpsons to a wrestling game went horribly wrong somewhere along the developement lines. I rented this game and I did enjoy the wisecracks and taunts made by the wrestlers in the game and believe me they were worth getting a kick out of. But the problem is you start out with few characters and the graphics are not that great. In most fighting games you now play, you have to know how to pull of certain moves and combos to achieve victory but all I can describe about the control for this game is pure button smashing. that is the only way to win, I tried using particular moves but gave up and resorted to pushing misc. buttons after about fifteen minutes. I believe that this would have been a much better conversion onto the Playstation 2 if anything. That would have impressed all those simpsons fans out there. But, sadly this game disappoints those true fans to the show. The only reason I gave this a 2 star rating sadly was out of my sympathy for the simpsons. This truly was a Great Concept Gone Horribly Wrong.	-1
i don't want to waste too much time on this crappy game...  it's just not good at all, and it's pretty funny how everyone keeps saying it's good just because other people and game review sites say it is.  maybe it's because this game was made years ago, before better games came along.  whatever.  nothing sets this game apart as fun or special, be it graphics or gameplay or story.	-1
I'll be frank. I purchased this game because it was cheap and I miss the old Doom shoot'em ups so I was feeling a bit nostalgic. But I must say that Red Faction is not a very good game. The graphics look like something from Super Nintendo, the controls will definitely get you wacked if the monkey enemies disquised as humans don't kill you first and the character voices! My god I though I was hearing people talk through a pillow being stuffed in their faces. Purely Awful!	-1
I couldn't even get through the first level. The graphics aren't 3-D but that's okay because the colors are awesome. I don't like the levels and the powers you can get. It seems very boring for me to go around and punch cages and weird...bad guys. The levels are really bad and it's too hard. Not a good GBA game.	-1
There is no doubt that Final Fantasy Legend (SaGa in Japan, billed as Final Fantasy in the United States to boost sales) was a highly advanced game for its time (1989).  However, it offers nothing that its sequel doesn't offer, and the game is, shall we say, very poor.  Not having the advantage of color that its contemporaries (Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy) had, the graphics are so poor that they were actually bad in 1989, which says a lot.  The story is about as simplistic as they come, and you should be able to beat this game in a few hours no problem.  Considering its limited availability now, I doubt anyone will really want to play this game - trust me, you aren't missing anything.  My fellow "old school" RPG players will call me a heretic, but this game has nothing memorable to offer.  Skip it.	-1
I'll be quick and to the point...this game is NOT Final Fantasy!!!  Did I mention it's also bad?  The story, music, and gameplay is as flat as the cartrige it's made on! SaGa Frotier has been wildly praised as the worst Squaresoft game ever produced, and it's no wonder why! The only reason it came here as Final Fantasy is because they figured that's the only way it would sell! My advice: Skip this game!	-1
I was so excited when I first bought this game. I raced home, popped it into my GBA played it for about 15 minutes, got up, and left to go do something else. I love Mario Kart, and if your reading this review about Krazy Racers I'm sure you've played it and like it too, and thats what Krazy racers is, a copy of Mario Kart, only 10x worse. Somehow, there isn't much track variety. Sure you'll go from an ice level to a space level to a stadium, bit some how, all the tracks just don't differ much from each other, in difficulty or anything. The characters, unless you've dedicated your long lasting life to Konami, chances are you probably won't know a whole bunch of them. The weapons are basically the same as in Mario Kart, just slightly different, blue rocket, red rocket, drill, and junk like that. The gameplay, well, for me did not do all that much. I was never in a moment where I had sweat dripping down my forehead with my palms sweating loosing grip of the controller and worrying that on the final lap if I don't win first I'll have game over and won't make it to the Super Cup. I never had one of those moments like I did in Mario Kart, the whole game just didn't pull me in. Graphics, good. Ok, my advice, please wait for Mario Kart Circuit, it should be a lot better with more famaliar characters for everybody(hopefully), and an overall better game. But this whole review is just my opinion. Game on.	-1
the computer will not let me install it, because it came with a trojin virest?  not sure of spelling, but you get the message.	-1
that was my expression as I beat teh game...no end boss, no new weapons, this game just doesn't feel like opposing force or teh original half life, at 10 bucks I'd suggest buying it if only for the high res pack and a quick run through the levels, but the game itself isn't that good, its not much combat mostly puzzles until the last 2 levels. My advice stands as: Buy it if only for the high res pack packaged in but don't expect much from teh game.	-1
This was a shock to me.  For one thing, this game was raved all across the internet.  For another thing, I'm familiar with the series (as far back as the first three NES games, to the SNES one, and Symphony of the Night), so I thought this would like those.  Well... the gameplay mechanics are here, it seems, but everything else...  Lets figure this out piece by piece.  First, the graphics were okay.  Even though they're dark, and even though they're a bit lacking in animation (only THREE frame to show the main character running??!), the style was okay, and it added to the environments.  The sound was nice, and the music was great, but everything here just seemed like it could be done much better (the music sounds a bit MIDI-ish, but the melodies are good).  The controls... here's where everything really goes down hill.  I'm no stranger to the Castlevania control scheme, having playing the first four games.  However, for reasons I cannot fathom, this game has by far the worst control setup of all of them (which says alot, because I've replayed the first three games recently, and they haven't aged that well).  First, controling your character is much like controling a big wooden stick.  While the same could be said for the first four games in the series, this game takes it to far worse extremes, especially when considering the enemies move so much better (in other words, they're attacks seem more suited to a game that has you moving your character as franticly as a Mega Man X or Mega Man Zero game).  Also, the option to have the whip spin by itself became rather annoying.  Unlike Castlevania 4, which allowed you to move the whip around by holding the attack button down, this one only makes it spin on it's own, which is somehow amazingly counter-productive.  Some of the abilities are nice (high jump, wall jump, etc...), but they don't alieviate this problem much, and actually require over-utilization in some areas (trust me, you would never survive the final battle without high jump).  Now the gameplay.  I've played other games that used the "Metroid-vania" style (free exploration, found in Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, as far as the ones I've played).  Somehow, this one takes that system and just makes you lost.  Seriously, this castle was not as fun to explore as all of the others.  The boss battles (mostly refering to the last 4) were super cheap, requiring me to over-use the DSS system to the most extreme, which was a far cry from the more "down to earth" battles from Castlevania 4 and Aria of Sorrow.  Much as I enjoy difficulty, I can't stand not being able to have a clear shot at a target with my whip due to the enemy being over-sized or too quick to dodge.  This is by far one of my most hated Castlevania games.  If you even think about buying this game (since a lot of other people liked it), I recommend you find a way to rent it first.  Otherwise, you may get yourself into a snag like I did.  Lucky for me, this was only $15 at K-Mart, which is about as low as GBA games get.	-1
This has to be the strangest game that I have ever played. It's about a doctor,who goes off the deep end and kills off everybody in a hospital. So his daughter(you) has to go into the hospital to investigate what's going on,and to find her father. The gameplay is absolutley terrible. You move slower than a snail. Moving around in this game,takes FOREVER.The graphics are cheesey-looking cinematics,that look dreadful(even for an older game) The dialouge is so bad,that it's laughable. It's very funny to hear your father calling your name..."Laura. Laura. This..is..your...father".See what I mean? Overall,this game does have a few scary moments,but it's otherwise mostly cheesey,outdated and just down right bad. Also,there is absolutley NO saving in this game. If you wanna beat it,you have to play it ALL THE WAY THROUGH.For TWO HOURS! But,I can assure you,after two minutes,you'll be bored to death of this game,from how lame it is. If you want a good survival horror game,then look elsewhere.	-1
I guess that the game is pretty fun to play, but the graphics are the worst thing I have ever seen! I think the makers should be ashamed of even thinking of making this a GBA game! This could easily be a GBC game! I can not reccomend this game at all.	-1
This game does not do any justice to Castlevania because the game's dark ambience is totally destroyed by GBA's poor screen.  Don't even think about playing the game under anything other than ideal lighting conditions.  You just won't be able to see much on the screen.  I was foolish enough to buy the game to play on my subway commute but boy, was it a true nightmare. The gameplay itself is classic.  You scroll to explore the environments, so it's very easy to play.  Konami should have lightened up the display and made the game GBA-friendly.  Then I would have given it a three-star or higher.	-1
Dont blink! By the time you open your eyes the game will be over. I was so excited by this new half-life release that I placed an advance order, and I am really dissapointed. If you are familiar with the half-life series you know what to expect. Great graphics, great story line, and of course great fun. However, I think that the guys over at sierra have a lot of nerve considering the length of this game. I am not someone who sits for hours and hours playing, Nevertheless, I finished this game with in two days. If you don't care about the short ride than I suggest you spend the money. On the other hand, if you are like me, and expect to get what you pay for, than hold on to your money and get a game thats worth the money, such as Deus Ex.	-1
This game is almost exactly like the original half life, but ten hours shorter.  The game starts out in a tram(sound familiar) and then all hell breaks loose down at black mesa for an unkown cause.  Im sorry, but I do not think that the original half life is even that good, so when this expansion pack came out i was not that excited for it.  Though I wasn't that enthusiastic I picked it up, and once i started playing I officially lost my taste for all half life games.  Even a novice gamer could finish this game in a matter of 4-6 hours of casual playing.  No complex puzzles, terrible sound, terrible graphics even with the new high definition pack, and way to much of the slide effect when walking.  Overall this game is short and leaves gamers unfulfilled, though it does contain opposing force, i still feel the 30 dollar price tag is way to much for a game with uncountable faults.	-1
This review is for Half-Life: Blue Shift (H-L:BS) and the High Definition pack (HD), If you want information about H-L:2 or Half-Life Opposing Force, you'll need to go elsewhere. To wit, this game caught me by surprise. One week, my usual foolish salesperson was ranting and raving about the soon to be released H-L:BS and next week, I see it in stores. I admit that I bought every single Half-Life (H-L) I could get my hands on from the original H-L and the Promo CD that came with ATI Rage cards, to the poorly done Gunman Chronicles (GC). I've downloaded and installed nearly every "hot" MOD that was flung out onto the web. So naturally, I snatched this up when I saw it in the stores. The HD pack offers very little other than enhanced characters and weapons. What I mean by enhanced is that the weapons are supposed to look more realistic, that is all! The levels look exactly the same. The A.I. did not improve any. It's really not worth the extra stress that the graphics would place on the hardware. Let's face it, the HD pack is not worth the price that any one wants for it. It should have been available for free much like the Team Fortress Classic. (I suppose it may be, I haven't checked to tell the truth.) So how is the game? Some of the most disappointing work I've seen. True, the level of detail and the devious level design are truly ingenious. I spent as much as thirty minutes on some levels trying to find my way about only to be thwarted by a well hidden tunnel or a well placed jumping pad. But despite the great levels, there aren't enough of them! The game is so short that I would have been better off playing GC which, up till now, was the shortest H-L based game. The game ends so abruptly that it's like a car hitting a brick wall. I sincerely thought that I was going to see some awesome programming prowess with a car I could actually drive! When it ends, it's , BAM! Just like that. I mean, where were all the extra stuff that I saw when I was riding the train? Oh . . . I walked right by it, I suppose. Where's the "old" Black Mesa base? Oh, wait. I'm walking around it now. That's a train yard? I'm not a train buff, but those train cars are impossible (Look at where the doors are placed on the cars). Aren't I supposed to be in the same base as Gordon Freeman? Oh wait, I guess I am. Oh well. "OK," I thought, "the game's over, I'll try it online." Guess what? There isn't any online gaming via H-L:BS. I checked with my original version of H-L. There is no online gaming if you just install H-L:BS. I'm guessing that the player can play online if they install H-L:O4 but that's just junk. The box clearly states that there is Multi-Player and it implies it in two different sections. One part for H-L:O4 and another for H-L:BS. What's the deal? So I read the manual, the box says it has Multi-Player support, the manual clearly states that there is a third pack in "game" called OpFor: On Line. What? It also clearly states that Multi-Player is only available in H-L:O4 (Page 8). What a joke. More hard drive space gobbled up unnecessarily. If you like H-L and you don't have the O4 pack then by all means buy this game. Otherwise, avoid it until you see it in the bargain bin. None of the "extras" are worth the incredibly short game and they really add nothing new by way of "new". I had to give it two stars since I gave GC three and I consider this game a step down from GC. Sorry folks, it's just not worth it unless I see it in the bargain bin.	-1
Having bought an import GBA, I was grabbing at any chance I had to get a new game for it.  It was too expensive to buy many import games, so I had to wait like anyone else for a new game.  So, when Majescos titles hit the sales floor, I grabbed this one, looking to be the most exciting of the bunch (having already played the highly mediocre Pitfall remake and beating Earthworm Jim.)  Little did I know I was falling for one of the oldest tricks in the books.  People will be lining up for new GBA games even before the system comes out, so if your game is first on the shelf, it will probably sell.  Majesco knew it had some mediocre titles, so they put them out extremely early to help guarantee sales, and it shows. First the good things.  I heard that it had incredible scaling effects, but I never expected this. It is gorgeous at first.  It will knock your socks off.  Then, you start to notice how repetitive the game is.  Each level is unique in the flight zone, but never changes.  And, from lack of anything better, it has a password function. And on to the bad.  This game is no fun to play.  It is extremely difficult and aggrivating.  The powerups are non-existant and hardly add any power to your ship.  And there is hardly any reward for knocking out fighters, because they still tend to hit you, so all you do is avoid getting hit 90% of the time.  There is no fun to it and is too frustrating to be played often, killing the replay value. So my opinion is to only get this one as a show-off of the insanely good graphics of the system, but don't let the person play more than 2 minutes or theyll get the wrong impression of this great new handheld.  Just sit back and wait the wekk until Castlevania and F-Zero come out and catch this one in the clearance racks in a month.	-1
This game has great graphics. thats about the only great thing about it. I just don't like the game i guess. the graphics are awesome though. a typical japanese animated game, with the best explosions you will see. as it claims, it is 3d, for the most part. Of the 4 games i bought, this is the least interesting but has the best graphics. The music is also ok, as it energizes and "pumps up" the audience.   One thing that i definitly did not like, is that you have to beat the game on one life. that means that on 2 levels you cannot lose a life. each time you beat a level it will give you a password, but if you lose four lives on the first level, you will have one for the rest of the game. i am not too good at these kind of action games, so i didn't get past the 3rd level.   The game play is poor overall. maybe im being to hard on it, but it is just horrible. when there is an object right in front of you, your ship blocks your vision, making you shoot blindly. throughout the 7 levels, it is just the same, horrible gameplay. Another ok thing about this game is that it can stand a large number of ships moving on the screen without a single bit of slowdown. The graphics and sound brought this game up from one star, but 2 is still not much.	-1
The game looks good on paper, but it's very difficult to play.  The missions are pretty much all the same, and the controls are very difficult, and you can't really see your enemy even on the backlit screen of the GBA SP.  Avoid.	-1
I bought this game with high expectations because of all the great reviews on amazon, in magazines, etc...  Plus the fact that i have been a fan of music all my life, especially DJ type stuff which MTV:MG2 claims to provide.  but if you really want to make some GOOD music i would advise against it.  first off every single vocal-riff is terrible and almost hurts to listen to them.  the vocal-riffs all sound "pop," meaning you hear some annoying little 18 year old singing "ohhhhh yeeeaaahh baaaby."  most of the riffs, other than vocals, are pretty chill but if you want to actually put together your own songs and not lift from other artists it is hard to make a solid rythem.  the reason for this is because in riff-edit mode you can only point to one key at a time which is a real ....  In all honesty this game just ins't very good.  if you really want to make some GOOD music then take your money elsware	-1
This game is a disappointment really bad game people if you wann be buy this game don't it like I did	-1
I don't own this game. BUT - I've seen it played on a PS2 (I own an XBox). Overall, I was unimpressed. The graphics look old and the towns crackling with pixelation. Kind of like the games I was used to on our old computers...nothing compared to the smooth, defined glow of the graphics Burnout 3 has on Xbox. You start with total crap for a car, and are supposed to build up as you "break into the underground". Really, you go crawling around in your tank - it says you're going 120 but it looks like you're going 35. Honest, I could imagine one of the pedestrians grabbing a skateboard and keeping up with the cars!  In Burnout 3, you literally rocket through the levels, flying at crazy speeds weaving in and out of traffic. Gets you excited. I watched someone drive their car in Midnight around for a while and about fell asleep...plus, no car damage, or not much. The old school "shove others out of the way, my car's invincible" gag.  Maybe it's just me. Maybe Burnout 3 spoiled me, or I just have alternate tastes. But I don't get why so many gamers stand behind sub-par games. Silent Hill 4 was supposed to be good - CRAP. Halo 2, perhaps the biggest game ever, was hyped to the max - BOR RING. Maybe I'm just got particular tastes in games that I just have to realize, for I've been disappointed recently.  Want good games, I suggest Burnout 3, Wolfenstein for a shooter (its okay) and Mortal Kombat Deception (bloody good fun). But I don't recommend this. Ugh.	-1
Scratched really bad. Played all the way through. Pretty fun game. Challenging. On to Budokai 2	-1
This game is frustrating and will make you want to bust your TV, if not your Playstation.  Say what!, the only way to advance is to get first place?  Okay, after time and time again, once you know the courese and can probably race it blind folded you can get it.  You ever play Driver?  Remeber the very last level when you drive the president and these black cars are constantly ramming you?  Think of how that made you feel.  You will get that same feeling when you place this game.	-1
This game is just weak, no strong quality that u would hope for pros: 1 lots of dbz caracters 2 fun for few secs cons: 1 waste of money 2 it needs a adventure mode 3  you will get tierd of it	-1
Dragon Ball Z Budokai is horrible. The graphics are ok, but the gameplay is slow. I'm not a big Dragon Ball Z fan, but I do like good fighting games and this is not one of them. I would not recommend buying this game, if you are DBZ fan then you might want to rent it.	-1
I can sum it up in one sentence:  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work with "Game Boy Color", it doesn't work with "Game Boy Advance", and it doesn't work with "Game Boy Advance SP".  My brother and I were trying to trade "Pok'emon" and whichever Game Boy had the purple side in it, their game said "Your friend isn't ready to trade yet" or something like that.  I tried pressing the buttons at the same time on the Game Boys, I tried having my brother hold the pieces in really tight, nothing worked.  This link cable is a rip-off, and I don't recommend it to anyone.	-1
This game does not hold up the voice acting is horrid. The graphics are crap ! And the story is just not interistting. Good for a good cheap thrill nothing else	-1
I have been waiting for this title to come out for a long time, but sadly I'm disgusted with how this game plays and looks.  If I'm not mistaken this company is creating [edited].  If that's the case, it's not a good showing for what to expect.  The graphics on "Shell Shock" look a few years old, the movement of the character is slow and rough.  And the overall feel for the game is boring.  Compare this game to [edited] There's no comparisons.  This is a definite trade-in and title to forget.	-1
This game is terrible! I went and got it the day it came out and played it for about a half hour and hated it. This is coming from a gamer who is only into mature titles, mostly war games such as [edited] The reasons this game sucks is too many to list but be warned...wait for [edited]!	-1
I love racing games.  My first experience with a killer racing game was Rage Racer on PS1.  I loved R4, Gran Turismo, and Gran Turismo 2, and Wipout 3 on the PS1.  The PS2's pure racers have been more sparse for me.  I loved GT3, but short of that, I consider the best car game on the system to be GTA3 and GTAVC.  Now, to the subject at hand: Automodellista breaks the one big rule of racing games.  It has horrible physics.  Rent it first, please.  Watch one of your replays.  Yes, you can come to a full stop just turning, and I'm not talking powersliding to a stop, you just stop when you turn.  Also, I've hit a wall and watched my car, with it's center of gravity fixed, rotate.  The tires aren't the source of propulsion in this game as they are in GTA and GT. Money...Rage Racer and the Gran Turismo series add fun because you have to buy the cars and buy the upgrades.  There is no concept of money in AM.  You want a viper, sure, have one.  You want another, to paint different, sure, have another.  Any car, you got it.  I'm talking before you race one race. However, the graphics are stunning, but who cares. Rent it so you know... Don't just trust me...	-1
was in POOR condition and was covered in disgusting stains that i am still removing today. i need a screwdriver to replace the chewed up joystick	-1
Should have went with another model. So difficult to get the controller to connect to the receiver.	-1
Complete and totally useless without the receiver unit! It's a paper weight.	-1
I was really surprised that this game was so awful since the first one quickly became a Platinum Hit. Red Faction II takes place in the same universe as the first game: the 22nd century, where humankind is ruled by an evil dictatorship and only the freedom fighters who call themselves the Red Faction are able to stand in its way. Parker, the hero of the first game, is nowhere to be found here, so no previous Red Faction experience is required or even expected.  This sequel introduces a nanotech enhanced soldier called Alias, whom you'll play as during the course of the single-player campaign. Alias is part of an elite squad developed to suppress insurgents like the Red Faction, but the squad has turned its coats and now seeks to rid the world of Chancellor Sopot, the man at the root of the Commonwealth's strife and poverty. The plot is pretty thin and the twist that's thrown in about halfway through seems ridiculous. In your mission to assassinate Sopot, you'll travel by air, sea and land while taking on droves of enemies and numerous challenging situations in a diverse and tightly paced series of levels.  Most single player, first-person shooters aren't very long and Red Faction II is no exception. Even though you'll run into several very tough bosses when playing through the game at the normal difficulty setting, expect to get through the campaign in approximately seven hours. It may be fun to play, but Red Faction II loses some points because it doesn't look all that great.  I found the textures were blurry and plain.  This is a game I would suggest that you rent first.	-1
I saw this game in the store and grabbed it right away, after playing the first Red Faction I thought this would only be better.  I was wrong. If you are looking for something better than the first Red Faction, this is not it, keep on looking.	-1
I can't believe this game was rated so high by others.  I think it's an awful game, totally boring, and I regret purchasing it.  It failed to hold my interest. I quit playing after the first boss.  A horror/mystery fan, I bought it hoping it would be similar to Resident Evil 4, but it's not even close.  A young girl goes around and gets attacked by ghosts. She has no weapon other than holy water and quickly gets panicked into death.  Her movements are awkward. The battles are awkward.  The graphics aren't very good and the game is not challenging.  I feel that the game wasn't developed as well as it could have been, and overall, I'd say it was disappointing.  I suggest that you rent it before you buy it.	-1
this game sucks.  If you want a truly disturbing game play the 3 fatal frames on ps2	-1
I liked the premise of the game, but this game was unnecessarily tedious.  I believe puzzles and boss fights should be hard but fun, not hard and tedious.  There is no internal logic to the game, which means the game is very limiting in its structures.  What you can use in regular gameplay is different from what you can do during boss fights.  Other things that inhibit the game play is the camera angles.  You don't know where your monster is coming from, so it could suddenly appear on your side.  It seems stupid to see Alyssa run directly into the arms of your killer just because the camera doesn't allow you to spin around.  And it doesn't help the Alyssa is slow, takes about 3 seconds to get to her feet, and is prone to panic attacks.  I liked the gore and creepiness of the game.  It was emotionally pulling although some of the dialogue needed rewriting.  The premise is not all the original but still enjoyable, but all this is inhibited by the gameplay.  I don't know if they're making a Clock Tower 4, but if they are, the developers should really study the classic horror games out there, and see why those work.	-1
The first game we played on Gamecube was Spongebob, Battle for Bikini Bottom.  We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over.  Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar, we rented it.  It's very hard to control the c-stick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldn't rotate the camera except for certain times.  The charactors were very distant and even if we used the c-stick to zoom in, it still wasn't close enough.  It's the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly! Another aspect we didn't like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor.  Maybe we're spoiled because the c-stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions.  It's surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite.	-1
This game has 5 great titles of classic games! They are Ms. Pac Man, Galaga, Galaxian, Dig Dug and Pole Postion. This sounds pretty decent, but really, no fun is coming out of this. Here's the reviews on the games  Ms. Pac Man: 2.5/5  I love Ms. Pac Man, but it's impossible to play on this. You play tiny, or huge, kinda like that one world in SM64. When you play tiny, it's too dificult to see where the ghosts are and such. The huge screen is useful, untill your scrolling down and run into a ghost you couldn't see.  Galaga: 3/5  It's fine, but it's boring. No value is brought to you when your playing.  Galaxian: 3/5  It's the same with Galaga, no replay value at all. I don't know why that's happening, but something dosn't feel right playing Galaga or Galaxian on the GBA.  Dig Dug: 4/5  This is very fun on this, one of the only games I play (I'm gonna sell this game soon). But the controls can be funky.  Pole Postion: 0/5  Oh my god, what happend here!?!?!? When the women's suppose to say: "Prepare to be qualified" all I hear is MMMMMMMMMEEEMMMM!!! It like mumbles. When your turning on this, you are complety messed up, dosn't work at all.  Overall: 1/5  If your an absoulte Dig Dug fan, get this, if your not, don't bother thinking about it.	-1
Namco Museum lets you play old Atari classics on your GameBoy Advance. These include Galaga, Galactica, Dig Dug, Pole Position, and Ms. Pac-Man! This is of course a great idea in theory - I *love* some of these games. But while the games might be really fun to play on a big-screen console, they are REALLY tough on the tiny screen. For example, Ms. Pac-Man comes in two modes - a full screen mode and one that scrolls up and down showing you a partial screen at a time. The full screen mode has REALLY really tiny ghosts and characters, you can barely time your movements and often get stuck on walls. The scrolling mode is better in the sense that the characters are larger, but now you can easily scroll down into an enemy and the same character control issues occur. On Pole Position, it's all about sliding left and right as your racecar goes around curves. With the arrow-control of the GBA, it's one light tap to make a hard turn. If you accidentially press too hard on the arrow, you smash into the side signs or nearby cars. It makes driving very difficult. Dig Dug is a great game, where you burrow in the ground and try to drop rocks on the heads of dragons. Is this Revenge of Smaug? Again, I love the game but the controls make it difficult. You can be planning a careful tunnel to a rock and end up off by a bit, making the tunnel useless. Galaga and Galaxian are both classic space-shooting games. Galaxian is a "secret bonus" in that it's not mentioned on the box but is provided on the cartridge. I really love both of them, but the controls are just as sluggish and imprecise here. With Galaxian having the penalty of "only one shot on the screen at a time", those missed shots make a huge difference in playability. If you have a regular console, I'd recommend these games on a differnet system. I love the games themselves! But the GBA version is rather awkward. Everyone I had try this out got frustrated very quickly.	-1
Museum Games are more of a lesson in classic gaming than an experience. Namco's Gameboy Advance release of the Namco Museum follow the same path the Williams has taken in their several Greatest Hits releases. This current installment of the Namco museum includes a roster of five games. These games are: Ms. Pac-Man (1980), Galaxian (1979), Galaga (1981), Dig Dug (1982), and Pole Position (1982). These games have been fully restored on a single GBA Cart for your portable convenience. Granted it is nice to have five different games on one cartridge, but I would hardly call this a worth while title. I can not site any performance issues, nor can I compare the Namco Museum to any of the current games out there. My reasoning behind this is because Namco fully restored Atari classics and packaged them for a modern system. Though I personally am not keen on this idea, I will admit, it is nice to remember the simple times.  Each game is configured to interface with the D-Pad and the face buttons, whereas the shoulder buttons have no function in this package, leaving the  controls as simple as the games themselves. To my disappointment, both Galaxian and Galaga are virtually the same game. This means that you are paying for four games, when they advertise five. The slight difference between Galasxian and Galaga is the entrance of the enemies. In Galaga, enemies fly into view and bombard you as they enter. In Galaxian, the enemies are just lined up at the top of the screen, waiting for you to shoot them. All NAMCO needs to do at this point is throw in Space Invaders and advertise six games, but  you will still only have four unique games. The bottom line is, the NAMCO Museum is more of a history lesson than a worth while game. I rated this a 2 stars because Ms. Pac-Man and Dig Dug are still fun titles, but the other three just don't have a lasting replay value.  I would pass this title up, unless it was on the discount rack for less than five dollars.	-1
The Sega Genesis version of this game is no where near as good as the arcade. In fact, I would say that it doesn't even come close. There are stages missing, Sheeva has been removed from the game, & voices have also been removed. The Animalities that are in the arcade version have also been removed. The music also sounds nothing like the arcade game. Scorpion's fatality has been changed. So has Stryker's Friendship. The only good thing about this game is that the hidden characters are instantly unlocked. If you are expecting alot from getting this title on the Genesis, you will be severely disappointed. If you have to have it as part of a collection, make sure that it's cheaply priced.	-1
This game is basically just an upgrade to Mortal Kombat 3. It brings back some old characters that were not in MK3. Such as Scorpion,Reptile,Kitana,Jade...as well as a few new ones such as Rain and Ermac. The Sega Genesis port and The SNES ports were kinda bland. It's been awhile since I played this game,but from what I can remember,there were some missing elements to this. I think Sheeva was missing,Animalalities were taken out,and a few backgrounds were gone too. Also with this Genesis version,you will also need a six button pad to play it. Like with MK3. Unless you wanna put yourself through the torcher of using a three button controller. My best advice would be to just leave UMK3 alone and pick up Mortal Kombat Trilogy for another system instead. It's got everything this game has and more. Only buy this,if you are a die hard Genesis collector,or if you don't own a Playstation,Nintendo 64 or a Sega Saturn.	-1
I expected something like SSX's trick system on a basketball court, I mean how could you go wrong with that formula? Obviously EA Sports Big did. This game is a good rental, tops. Buying it is suicide, because I beat it in two days and unlocked all the characters (including the gigantic Chinese guy) and all the courts. What makes this game so lackluster is no four player support, which is a must for any sports game, downright awful play-by-play announcing, and repetitive gameplay. I played it with a friend for a while, but we agreed it lost it's appeal quickly. NBA Jam is still the best hoops game off all time, while NBA Street is only a memory.	-1
I enjoy many racing games . . . GT3, Burnout, Rallisport . . . but this one is horrible. Handling is fine, graphics are beautiful, replay fun, but everything else doesn't live up to the hype. Sound: you cannot hear the cars, the cheering washes out the cars and no way to adjust what sound is at what level. Tracks: are odd and irregular. And AI seem to cheat a bit . . . but that is in every game to a degree.	-1
Many have already written on this game, so I'll try to avoid repeating what they've said, but ultimately, this game starts out strong and entertaining enough, but settles into a middle-ground groove that's neither bad, nor great, but not all too awe-inspiring as the game goes on. The voice actor for Indiana Jones is passable, but not too convincing -- you can tell it's not Harrison Ford. And unsurprisingly, it dusts off the long-lived stereotype of the dragon lady and at the end, Indiana gets the Asian (i.e. Chinese) girl, even though there's no plausible reason for her to have any sort of feelings for him -- she's little more than a toy doll for him to have his way with. The ending is dull -- both the final boss battle and the ending cinematic are little reward for having ran, swung, punched and kicked your way through level after level, trap after trap. Good if you're an Indiana Jones fan, but others should either rent or stay away altogether.	-1
Sonic 3D Blast is quite different from the 2D Sonic games on Genesis. Instead of running through zones to get to Eggman, Sonic has to rescue birds called Flickies from Eggman's robots to proceed. I'm fine with rescuing birds even if it is a bit strange (although the idea was also in Sonic Adventure). What I do not like about the game is how weak it is. The graphics are not in 3D at all, they are simply set at an 3/4 overhead view similar to Zelda and Super Mario RPG. They are good for the Genesis, but if you want to see better consider getting the Saturn version. The soundtrack is weak, repeats a lot, and normally does not fit the zones very well. Again, if you want an amazing musical score you should get the Saturn port. After the terrible music was muted I found the controls were VERY slippery. I tried it with the standard D-Pad and found it was almost impossible to change direction. Using a joystick is not much better. The controls, aside from not having a proper configuration, have bad traction. Along with the dreadful music and controls is the boss fights. Eggman has been and always will be a wimp, but he hardly is trying in 3D Blast. Normally it is the terrain that supplies the hazards while Eggman flys around shooting something at you. Honestly, I am a huge Sonic fan but I can not stand this game. If anything you should buy the Saturn version, or just play a real 3D game like Sonic Adventure.	-1
I got this game for just $4 off Amazon.com with high hopes for a Super Nintendo baseball game.  Wow.  Terrible isn't even a strong enough word to describe this mess.  This reminds me of so many movie video games which slap the name on their hoping kids would buy them but the actual game is horrible.  First off, the graphics on this game are just atrocious.  Play a game like Super Bases Loaded, a VERY early release for the SNES, and you'll see just how superior a baseball game it is.  Another major problem:  Because I believe Tecmo had the MLB rights back during this time, the only REAL player you get in the game is Ken Griffey Jr.  Everyone else are a bunch of false names.  That might work for you but it's a little misleading when you see Ken Griffey on the cover only to not see the players on your favorite team.  But what really just BREAKS this game is the actual gameplay.  You literally cannot control your pitching outside of the speed.  Making a ball curve?  No way.  Though the computer has no problem. :)  Batting and fielding are just about as bad.  As I mentioned in the title, you get a FAR better experience with games like Baseball and Baseball Stars for the originaly NES then you will ever get with this game.  If you want a much deeper baseball experience, I recommend MLB Power Pros for the PS2, it can be had for around $5-10 bucks, and trumps games like this easily.  For the SNES, Baseball Simulator 1.000 is pretty much the standard bearer on the system IMO for a baseball game.  Super Bases Loaded also is a much better game.  Save your $4 and just pass on this one.  You will be glad you did.	-1
THIS VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT 3 SUCKS. THE CHARACTERS ARE BORING HERE, THE GRAPHICS ARE BAD, THE MUSIC IS BAD, AND THE FATALITIES AREN'T AS GOOD IN THIS VERSION. THIS IS NOT REALLY A GOOD VERSION OF MK 3 TO BUY. BUT, MK 3 WASN'T REALLY THAT GOOD OF A GAME TO BEGIN WITH. IF YOU WANT THIS GAME, I SUGGEST YOU LOOK FOR THE PLAYSTATION VERSION AND LEAVE ALL THE OTHER VERSIONS OF THIS GAME ALONE. THIS WAS ONE OF THE LAST 2 MK GAMES THAT CAME OUT ON THE SUPER NINTENDO BEFORE IT WAS DISCONTINUED FOR THE NINTENDO 64.	-1
As the other 1 star reviewers have stated this game is ridiculously frustrating.  This game alienated so many fans away from Mortal Kombat that many of us did not even bother playing MK4.  If not for Deadly Alliance resurrecting the franchise I would have never bothered playing another MK game because of MK3.  The AI in MK3 for the SNES is cheap beyond compare with the computer knowing your movements and commands and countering before you have a chance to respond.  The run button is a new feature and speeds up the gameplay but not in a good way against the computer. The AI seems to go from easy to extremely hard every time you move up the ladder to a next opponent. there is little strategy the player can use besides picking the following 3 characters Cyrax, Sub Zero and Jax and cheaping the computer to death with the same move over and over.  When you battle against Lui Kang, Kung Loa, Sheeva or Kabal the computer AI never screws up or misses on those 7 or 8 hit combos so half your life bar will be down to nothing without even a chance to fight back.  The game sorely needed a combo breaker like Killer Instinct had.  The endless throwing in the game is another irritating feature.  It was put in to stop turtling aka (using the crouching block) supposedly to speed up gameplay but used as another cheap attack .  I so want to give this game a 2 star rating because it is a Mortal Kombat game full of characters we all know and like but I just can't.  Because the game is just that bad. I would not want any buyer out there to waste there time playing this.  MK3 is the black sheep of all the Mortal Kombat games.  This game is only good on the 2 player option playing against your friends it holds the lowest replay value in the whole series of MK on the SNES.  Yes even the severely handicapped first game is better than this game.  I totally agree with the other reviewers that said the backgrounds were lame and uninspiring.  What's worse is this game has some level loop glitch that keeps players in the same 3 stages if you or your opponent uppercut you through the floor to the street level.  Play the game a few times and you will see what I mean.  Also MK3 on the SNES did not fix the only weakness on MK2 which was a credit limit of 5.  It is supposed to be like the arcade.  What is this credit BS. This is where SF2 always got it right by not limiting continues.  I know you can do a long code to get 30 credits but you should not have to. It is another irritating feature you should not have to deal with making the game that much more frustrating.  If you are going to limit continues what's the point of the difficulty option.  Finally the bosses and endurance rounds.  I liked the challenge of the endurance rounds but in a game already this cheap it is unnecessary.  Motaro just pisses you off rather than inspire you to keep fighting him.  Kintaro in MK2 was a great sub boss and anytime I lost to him I felt like I had a chance, and that I will destroy him in the next round.  But not against Motaro throwing endless fireballs at you after you are already dead its like he is giving you the bird literally.  Shoa Kahn is pretty much the same besides the big hammer and vertical knee his stage is so blah though that is the best they could come up with.  The creators at Midway also did not even bother putting in the original ending shots for each character just text of what was said.  That right there is just lazy.  So in conclusion don't waste your time on this game.  The only MK game on the SNES worth playing was 2.  Gameplay: 5/10 Play Control: 6/10 Story/Originality: 5/10 Challenge: 8/10 (Motaro very cheap) Fun Factor/Replay value 4/10	-1
MK 1 and MK 2 were pure gold.  MK3 adds some cool characters but it totally sucks.  The AI makes this game nearly unbearable they are super nazi cheese kings that know your every move before you even do it and magically avoid your moves and counter everything in a quick and cheese bs fest manner that the player con not come close to doing.  The unfair level in this game makes it only fun playing two players.  The bosses are unfair cheese lords too.  This just sucks other than the new cyber ninja's nothing to care for here.	-1
You should have seen the look of disappointment on my face when I first played Mortal Kombat 3. I actually received the game a day before its official release. My dad's ex-girlfriend found a copy of it somewhere and bought it for me. While that was a nice, unexpected thing for her to do, I really don't like the game.  I hate Mortal Kombat 3 not only because many of the classic fighters of the past aren't included, but for another MAJOR reason- the actual fighting sucks. I absolutely DESPISE the fact that combos have been added to the Mortal Kombat series. Nothing more irritating than doing really well in a fight ONLY for the computer to suddenly get this amazing burst of energy and charge at me with devastating combo after devastating combo. That right there ruins the game *completely*.  Speaking of combos, actually being able to pull one off is almost impossible thanks to the way the game company designed the combo system. They made it so you have to press a BUNCH of buttons *exactly the right way* at *exactly the right time* or else the combo won't work. Yeah, I'll really have time to properly do THAT in the middle of a fight...  The fatalities are horrible-looking. They look *really* cheap. The fatalities in Mortal Kombat 2 are graphic and bloody, but the ones in THIS game are terrible because they are so darn cheesy-looking. They aren't as violent as you'd expect them to be in a Mortal Kombat game. In fact, the amount of blood in the game went down *considerably*. A *little* wave of blood splashes from your opponents body when you punch or kick them, and I hate it *so much*. It's almost like a normal fighting game. If it didn't say "Mortal Kombat" on the box you wouldn't even know you were playing a Mortal Kombat game!  I hate the fact that they modernized the levels so you can fight your opponent on the city streets with buildings and other normal-looking things in the background. I have news for you- EVERY fighting game features a city level. I thought the people behind Mortal Kombat were more creative than to copy what everyone ELSE is doing. I guess not.  But the one thing that makes the game worthless in my opinion is the fact that there seems to be a bug in the game that makes the computer REALLY cheap-shot you after you win just ONE fight in the tournament. For instance, let's say you start a tournament with Liu Kang and you have the game on easy mode. You defeat your very first opponent in two straight rounds and move on to the next fight. No problem, right? Suddenly *for no reason at all* the next opponent will RIP YOU TO SHREDS with combos and other things, giving you NO TIME AT ALL to respond. You lose both rounds and have to do the fight again. Remember, this is on EASY mode.  Let's say, you try it again with Liu Kang (or anyone you want). For some reason, NOW the fight is easy. NOW the computer isn't throwing combo after combo at you and NOW you can complete the fight without much of a problem. You beat your opponent in two simple rounds and move on to the next fighter. Guess what? The INSANE cheap-shotting has returned, and in a matter of seconds you die in two rounds. You're shocked and confused that the game has turned into INSANE mode. Time to hit the continue button. You pick Liu Kang as your playable character again... nah, let's make it Kabal this time. Guess what? The fight is BACK to easy. Your opponent is dead in two rounds.  You can't understand why the tournament fighting bounces back and forth between easy and INSANELY difficult. After all, you put the game on easy, it SHOULD BE EASY! The next opponent you have to face... yup, you guessed it- nearly impossible to defeat him until you die and try it again!!  Do you see the pattern here? After you beat an opponent easily in two rounds, the next fight will be *just the opposite* with you having to face an EXTREMELY challenging fighter, and most likely you will NOT be able to beat him. But the NEXT time you face him he *will* be easy! Do you see why the tournament is so frustrating?  You win, you die, you win, you die, and the tournament will keep going like this until eventually you run out of continues and therefore, die.  NO WAY can you put a positive spin on this.  That's the dumbest and cheapest thing I've ever seen in a fighting game, and that's the main reason I hate Mortal Kombat 3 more than ANY other game. At the very least, when you enter a tournament on easy mode it should START off easy and *gradually* build to a challenge by the time the final opponent rolls around. Not any of this "easy this fight, impossible the next fight" crap.  Avoid Mortal Kombat 3 forever.	-1
This game suffers from an unusual problem that most sequels don't: it seems the developers listened to the gaming community.  The first Spider-Man The Movie game was a lot of fun, but it had it's limitations- it was too linear, there was no room for exploration, and your activities were limited to the skies and rooftops and a few indoor areas.  Spidey-fans and gamers alike wanted more room to swing and more opportunities to use their great powers with great responsibility- but less linearity.  S-M2 bucks that trend.  In a nod to Grand Theft Auto 3-style gaming, the city is now yours to explore.  There are huge skyscrapers, dark alleyways, and bustling streets.  You can either choose to follow along with the linear plot, seek out mini-missions that net you points you can use to purchase upgrades, or hunt down hidden items (for no apparent reason than a higher overall score).  While great in concept, the implementation is sorely lacking.  There are only a handful of randomly-generated mini-mission types (car chases, robberies, air-land-and-sea rescues), which forces you to replay the same tired action sequences over and over and over.  Fun for a bit, but not for hours and hours of filler.  The way the game is structured, you have to purchase upgrades to progress- so you are forced to take hundreds of these mini-missions to follow the game's main plot.  Swinging around the city is lots of fun, and you get a bunch of different upgrades (web zip line and slingshot for example) that aren't really functionally necessary, but still add to your enjoyment.  In addition, you can pull off weird midair Tony Hawk-like stunts (also purchasable)for no apparent reason other than that they are marginally enjoyable as well.  The main plot is well done.  It diverges from the movie and adds in some nifty comic book characters such as Rhino and the Black Cat, but the generally outline- defeat Octavius and win back Mary Jane, remains the same.  The fighting system has apparent depth, but most combat against non-bosses can be resolved with button mashing.  It can be fun at times, tossing bad guys left and right- but after awhile pounding thugs into the pavement or hanging them off lampposts looses all semblance of a challenge.  S-M2 is also the 700,000 game to feature a Matrix "bullettime" mode.  Yawn.  So much could have been done with this game that I can't help but suspect that we were given an unfinished product set to be released concurrently with the movie.  It is truly a shame.  Not worth the full purchase price.  Rent or buy used unless you're a Spider-Man fanatic.  If so, find a good sale...	-1
They say if it ain't broke, then don't fix it. I loved the first Spider-Man game. The graphics were crisp and detailed, the story was deep and involving, and the controls were precise and tight. Then Grand Theft Auto: Vice City came out, which completely re-wrote the video game genre. Games like True Crime and The Getaway were released that practically copied the GTA formula: Free roaming cities, mini-missions, mayhem and violence, etc. Add Spider-Man 2 to the list with mediocre results. I admit that I was initially excited when I heard that Spider-Man could now swing freely through the city and bust bad guys on the streets below. Though the former is exhilirating and excellently implemented, the latter is dull and repititious. Like GTA, there is a mini-map of the city in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Whenever there is trouble, a green icon will appear in the location where a crime is taking place. Unfortunately, there is a lack of variety in these missions. You will either have to prevent a robber from getting away, take an injured civilian to the hospital, catch a civilian from falling to his or her death, or save people from a sinking boat. After a few of these, you'll begin wishing that the game would just get on with the story. Solving these missions contribute to your "Hero Points" which allow you to purchase moves and combos from a Spidey Store. Since when did Spidey have to buy his own moves and combos? Strange... Unfortunately, due to the heavy reliance on memory and processing power to produce the massive scope of the game, the graphics are the first to suffer. In most instances, the game resembled a Playstation 1 game. Spidey generally looks good, but the other characters in the game look like spray-painted cardboard boxes. I would have preferred a much scaled-down city in order to boost the quality of the graphics because quite frankly, Spider-Man 2 is an ugly game. Fans of the first game will most likely be disappointed with the sequel. Though the ability to explore the city by swinging from building to building is a treat, the gameplay and graphics truly suffer. This one is definately a rental.	-1
I purchased this game on June 29 and popped it in immediately, getting all revved up for the enjoyable experiance of being everyone's favorite friendly neighborhood spiderman Then the load screen happened, and I gasped. The colours only use a 4 wheel spectrum for the most part dating back to the origianl spider man comic book game on the PS1.  The characters mouths don't move, the hands are mittens and the colours when you get up close aren't that great either. Now the game play. The swing machanics, even on extreme, are simplistic and do what the game tells them to, as for roaming around the city, it's not enjoyable or fun.  You have maybe 4 variety of missions which you MUST do before getting on with this story.  None of them are fun or creative. This game does deserve two stars though for voice acting, it's tremedously good and corny.  What you'd expect from a spiderman era game.	-1
Ladies and gentlemen be warned. This game is a popular series that has --until this point-- been very enjoyable. But Treyarch has seriously lost their touch. Spiderman 2 starts out as a wonderful game, the ability to visit street level and foil "everyday crimes" around the city is awesome. But the "level bosses" (fights that you must complete to move on) are terribly designed. One level (Mysterio's burning theatre) is impossibly difficult simply because of the terrible web slinging controls the game has employed. Another level (Statue of Liberty) is so bad that you'll want to return the game. This game deserves no honors whatsoever, since the designers spent too much time trying to do "cool" things, rather than making it playable. Go back to the older Spiderman games and you'll enjoy yourself a lot more.	-1
didn't work have to get it resurfaced and hope it works	-1
It's boring, I gave up on it early in the game, not sure why I can't get into the "Xeno" series and I'm a huge JRPG fan. I still consider Final Fantasy X and Dragon Quest VIII the best RPG's on the PS2. One thing that I kinda enjoyed in this game was using the Kos-Mos android girl, but it wasn't enough to keep me interested, there's like way, way too many filler cut-scenes and you soon grow tired of the entire cast. And on a side note the character facial animations are horrible here, like a failed attempt at cell shading anime style.	-1
My husband said he thought I would love this since I absolutely love Final Fantasy games. I didn't care for this game and turned around and sold it within a week of purchasing it.	-1
Ok....a cutscene here and there, ok........a cutscene every freakin time you move, that goes on for 45 minutes is NOT fun.  My save game is clocked at 19 hours, and I'm sure I only played about 3 or 4 of those hours.  And when I was playing all I was doing was running around!!!!!!!!  How in god's name did you all give this game a 5??  You want a good game that's similart to this, Get shadow hearts (preferably 2) it's a THOUSAND times better.  After playing that, you'll wonder how the hell you EVER gave this 5 stars, therefore convincing me to buy this AWFUL game.  I had more fun playing the Xenocard game than I did with the rest of it.  And even that I got bored with.	-1
I'll write this review at the risk of unfounded backlash. I mainly focus on the story aspects of RPGs, so I'll start with that. I've heard this game has the best story in any RPG. I've played maybe 15-20 hours and the main character frustrated me so much that I stopped after the realization came to me that she would not wise up. I don't want to wait another 20 hours before the story gets "great". This game is, well, as many games are, for kids. The female main character is brash, foolish, and screws over the rest of the characters more than once, and harvests no sympathy from me. The male character who wants to "score a date" with her is weakly portrayed and serves as comic relief for a younger audience. Many of the other characters are cute at first, from their image to their personalities, and their backgrounds are deadly serious. Yet, much of it is melodrama and becomes unengaging. The reason I've listed two stars is because the graphics and sound are anything you'd expect from a Squaresoft founded title, even if it's been taken over by Namco. As for this "game" being a so-called game, it's functionality is repetetive and boring from the unengaging battle sequences to the endless upgrades you must make for your characters attacks that serve to keep the player busy rather than entertained. This game is even more disappointing than the dreaded FFX and FFX-2. ... I expected so much more for SquareSoft.	-1
I just started playing this game, so I can't write a great review on it.  What I can tell you is that there is a good reason why just starting might end up being the only thing I do in this game. First off the game has some faults to begin with, the graphics are a bit dull if you ask me.  The characters are kind of on the blockish side, they walk around as if they have spoons up their behinds.  This might pass on the PSX but it's not acceptable on a console like the PS2.  The characters and visuals seem pretty stale when compared to the sheer romantic artistry and beauty that goes beyond explanation of Final Fantasy X, but of course what doesn't.  That's why Final Fantasy is Final Fantasy and Xenosaga is... well Xenosaga. The Xenosaga plot seems pretty interesting so far, but again this is an RPG and interesting might not be enough.  When I first started Final Fantasy X, I will admit I wasn't too trilled but then something happened.  I can't pin point the exact moment but it was pretty early in the game when it just grabbed me and never let go. Can't say the same for FFX-2 however.  Moving on, I have a feeling Xenosaga has a super great plot, but unfortunately I may not get to experience it because the gameplay has one huge flaw that I don't think I can handle. I was interested in Xenosage because it was supposed to be an epic RPG.  I play RPG's for the involvement in an epic storyline, I don't play RPG's for gameplay.  I feel sorry for anyone who plays RPG's for the menu selections, if you want gameplay there are better genres out there.  I always scratch my head when people complain about too many cutscenes in an RPG or that the game doesn't have enough exploration.  If you want gameplay and exploration go play something else.  That's the problem with Xenosaga, it's not just an RPG it's also an adventure platformer and not a very good one at that.  The platformer part of Xenosaga is suppose to be the second hand focus of the game and the quality of it shows that, but there seems to be too much of it.  There are too many enemies to be avoided by actually using your skill with the controller.  There are too many keys to find, too many doors to unlock, and all sorts of rooms that will get you lost.  It's not like it's there just incase you want to look around.  Nope, you find out you need to go somewhere but the map doesn't show you where, you have to search for it yourself.  This is just not what I look for in an RPG.  If this doesn't change in Xenosaga soon, I'm afraid I'll have to can it.	-1
Xenosaga is not a true RPG, nor is pretty much any console game out there. Saga to me, however, doesn't really even qualify as a game, considering you do roughly half as much watching as you do playing, which is extrememly ridiculous. Believe me, I have patience, but when it comes to watching dozens of 30-45 minute cutscenes, you can count me out. If Xenosaga is to get credit, it is for it's plotline. While it is interesting and thought provoking, it also doesn't bother to explain ANYTHING. Yes, this is Episode 1 of a 6 part series, but who cares; this is a game, it has a 50 dollar price tag, and I damn sure don't want to pay that much for a game that pretty much rips you off. On one hand, the cutscenes are well made, almost on the lines of MGS2. On the other hand, the first half of the game features mostly extrememly tedious and boring cutscenes. It is only in the next half of the game where things get interesting, but a lot of people will stop forcing themselves to play by then. Yes I said 'forcing', because the gameplay is utterly BORINGG. If theres one word that I would use to describe Saga's gameplay, its LINEARITY. Stick with me here: you watch a 45 minute cutscene, you run down a hall, take a few turns, fight some random battles, watch another cutscene, run down a hall, fight some battles, watch another cutscene, play through a long, tedious dungeon, watch another cutscene. You get the picture now? You see, the problem here is, the gameplay and story feel completely seperate. Its almost as if your watching an anime movie, except there are a few playable parts. The big problem is that the few playable parts are extrememly boring. Sure, the battle system isn't that bad by any means, but by the 20th battle, you'll be wondering why the hell your even playing. And that's what I asked myself while playing the game: why the hell am I forcing myself to go on? Just so I can watch another 45 minute cutscene? From what I remember, games are suppost to be 'played', and are suppost to be 'fun'. Xenosaga is not an RPG. You want a 'real' rpg? Play Morrowind or Neverwinter Nights on multiplayer. Don't get me wrong here, Saga isn't a failure, it's just that the gameplay feels like a poor excuse to keep watching more cut scenes. I sure as hell am never going to play this game again. I am a huge Xenogears fanatic, and I really hope that Episode 2 doesn't turn out like this one. Xenosaga Ep1 is easily the biggest dissapointment for me in a long, long time, considering I have waited for this game for years. Thumbs down.	-1
product was advertised with original book of codes and didn't come with it... kinda Necessary if its use is to be of valued..and the only books available are twice what the genie costs...	-1
This game ranks up there with possibly being the WORST game I ever played. I got the demo way back when it came out and I loved it. I played it just about every night for a few weeks and had mastered it. I bought the game when the price went down and I installed it. The game bugged out on me in training and I couldn't drive the truck like I was supposed to. I gave up on it and a week later my computer basically tanked. I assumed that was part of the problem with the game, as I was having trouble with other games that used to play fine. I happened to have lost the game for some time and I finally found it in a box in my parent's house two years ago. I took it and finally played it a while back and I was completely at odds with the demo I remembered so well and resurrected to play before starting the game again. The game played nothing like the demo and I swear that I was losing EVERY mission even if the goals got completed. I never understood how to use the "tactical map" for a long time and when I finally figured it out, it still didn't help. The friendly AI has as much sense as a cardboard box, the enemies are apparently sharpshooters with tanks, and it seems that while you only take 1-3 bullet wounds to die, the enemy takes at least 10. The graphics were awful (and it isn't due to me being spoiled by newer games since I still play MS-DOS games on occasion). I couldn't believe how terrible this game was. It has been put into a box so I can forget about it.	-1
I am wondering if I played the same Operation:Flashpoint as the rest of the reviewers because this was the latest in a long line of terrible military 1st person shooter games.  The graphics are mediocre, while the playability is absolutely horrible.  I took this game back and exchanged it less than an hour after buying it. It ranks among the worst military shooters I have ever played along with the Delta Force games, the Clancy games(The Rainbow Six series that is), and others. Don't waste time or money on this ... game.  It's disappointing that no one seems to be able to come up with a good 1st person military adventure shooter game.  The only two decent ones I've seen recently were Medal Of Honor and Return To Wolfenstein.  Again, don't waste money on this awful game.	-1
I'm going to get straight to the point on this one. If you already own Ghost Recon, I highly suggest you don't waste your money on Operation Flashpoint. You are going to end up so disapointed you'll probably quit buying computer games for a month. Heres why: The graphics are pretty impressive. However, you just don't get the same "feel" as you do in Ghost Recon. It's more "video game" graphics than realism. It's almost a glorified super mario brothers type graphics. Get the idea? The sound is another issue. It just doesn't make you feel like your actually out on the battle field. The radio transmissions will give you a headache and confuse the heck out of you before you can actually understand them. Ever turn on the TV when the cables out? You know the white snow noise? Imagine playing a military game and 90 percent of the time that's all you hear. The gun fights are boring. You get shot at by little dots that look like soldiers about 100 meters away. You don't actually feel like they are on top of you like in Ghost Recon. The BOTTOM LINE is this...If you want a Realistic military infantry game, go with Ghost Recon. It's got the graphics, and the sound that you expect from a great military game. If you don't beleive me, play both of them, and you'll quickly see what I'm talking about. Take your money and go with Ghost Recon, you'll be VERY happy you did. Take care. **Update** I currently put this on my new system (2.8ghz P4 Geforce 4 Ti 4600 etc) to see if it was any better, and same result. Decent game, but not up to par with whats out there. Its getting cheaper, and the price is getting closer to what its worth.	-1
This is the worst. I want my money back. Klunky, lost, unplayable. I would give it a minus star if I could.	-1
Considering how much I've hated (and continue to hate) regular Mortal Kombat 3 since it was first released almost 12 years ago, it was only natural that I would also have a strong dislike for "Ultimate" Mortal Kombat 3. But, if you've never seen any of my other reviews for other Mortal Kombat games, here's why I really hate this game.  - Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was the beginning of the end for the series because THIS is the game that started the trend of having WAY TOO MANY unnecessary Mortal Kombat games on the market, making everyone who used to enjoy the series SICK TO DEATH of it.  - The actual fighting in this game is exactly the same as in Mortal Kombat 3. Which means, I hate it. It's like the company knew how much I hated the direction they took the Mortal Kombat series starting with the third installment, so they decided to create more or less the same game but with old familiar fighters returning. They did this on purpose to annoy ME. If the actual fighting stinks, it doesn't matter WHO returns. It's like Midway knew they made a mistake with the original Mortal Kombat 3 by introducing people to a list of all-new fighters, but they somehow DIDN'T realize that adding combos and a run button was the main reason Mortal Kombat 3 was such an awful game in the first place.  So running around delivering combos is *still* here.  BAD move.  - I hate when something is supposed to be the complete package, but instead, when you play the game, you find out that a bunch of things are missing. That's exactly what we have with this game. It's sort of like opening up a Christmas present to find nothing but styrofoam chips inside. Okay, the game isn't as bad as waking up Christmas morning and being insulted with an empty box, but still...  It would be best to never even think about touching this game.	-1
THIS IS JUST A DUMB GAME LIKE MK 3 WAS. ALMOST ALL VERSIONS OF THIS GAME WAS STUPID EXCEPT FOR THE SEGA SATURN VERSION. BUT, NONE OF THE HOME VERSIONS WERE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ARACDE VERSION. THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME. THE GRAPHICS ARE VERY INFERIOR LIKE THOSE OF THE REGULAR MORTAL KOMBAT 3 FOR THIS SYSTEM AND THE CONTROLS ARE BAD. IF YOU EVER WILL FIND IT AND YOU STILL HAVE ITS SYSTEM, GET THE SEGA SATURN VERSION ONLY!!!!! UNFORTUNATELY, THERE NEVER WAS A PLAYSTATION VERSION FOR THIS GAME. THE LAST MK GAME THAT WAS RELEASED FOR SUPER NINTENDO BEFORE THE SYSTEM WAS DISCONTINUED FOR THE NINTENDO 64.	-1
I was quite excited about Operation Flashpoint after playing the demo.  It seemed the most realistic portrayl of warfare yet on the PC HOWEVER, after a failed installation I went to various websites attempting to find a soloution.  I read through 30 pages of people expressing problems with the patches, installation, textures and various other features of the game.  I am sure that for those of you who can install it, it will be nice however, check out the...to see what the people who have problems are saying.  I would not recommend a purchase of this game until you can be certain the bugs are fixed.	-1
to much loading on games but it's ok for a sega system	-1
Disappointment... Really this system simply is avarage at best, no wonder it's sinked sega. The worst things are.. 1) Save system: no memory card... the saves are recorded in the internal ram.. now apart from the fact  storage is really limited... within 2 years you lose all the games save. 2)Bugs... the most of times the console freezes 3) Bad control, no analogical gamepad exists 4) Localization: Most of the greatest games are japan only.	-1
The Saturn was a briefly popular 32-bit video game system created by Sega in the 90's.  It was designed to compete with the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64.  Unfortunately for Sega, the Saturn ranks a distant third in terms of enjoyment value.  Looking back, I'd say the Sega Saturn really isn't that bad a system.  I used to play it with my friend and I'd say I had a *little* fun.  It's just that Sony was pumping out an *unbelievable* amount of excellent games during the EXACT time Sega was trying to market the Saturn and, as you know, Sony came out of nowhere and grabbed the attention of millions and millions of video game fans.  This made it VERY hard for Sega to keep up with the surprising success of the Playstation.  Sony wasn't fooling around back then- they were on a mission to dominate the video game market and BOY did they ever succeed.  It permanently changed the video game scene; destroying the console wars between Nintendo and Sega.  Sony coming out of nowhere and almost *immediately* ruling the market pretty much spelled the end of Nintendo and Sega being the only two video game companies competing with each other.  Now a THIRD company entered the mix.  To put it another way- Sony temporarily brought Nintendo to its knees and, in the process, knocked out Sega forever.  Sega was never able to recover from the damage Sony had done.  Everyone thought Nintendo would be the company to destroy Sega.  Nope!  Nintendo came close a few times, though.  With Sega's well-known history of bad marketing techniques, this might have been for the best.  I bet Sega would have continued to struggle if they had made the decision to keep themselves in the console-releasing market after the Dreamcast was finished.  I bet Sega would be looking pretty ugly right now, in terms of sales.  Good thing they pulled away.  Because the Sega Saturn didn't have a long life, the few people out there who actually own one HAVE to notice its main weak point- not very many games to choose from.  The good Saturn games you CAN choose from are either really rare and expensive, or import games never released in America. That's the biggest problem with the Saturn.  Just not enough.  To give Sega credit, the Saturn DOES have some quality games such as Virtua Fighter 2, Guardian Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Shining Force III, Sonic Jam, Nights and Dracula X.  BUT- and here's the important thing I want you to remember- it would be IMPOSSIBLE to ignore the many crappy games released for the Saturn.  Worthless games such as Corpse Killer, Bug Too!, Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga, Hi-Octane, G-Vector and The House of the Dead don't exactly show off the Saturn's amazing capabilities.  Also keep in mind that the Sega Saturn was an *extremely* awful system when it came to sports games.  Just about every basketball and hockey game released for the system isn't worth a darn.  To me that's surprising when you consider the Sega Genesis was known at one point as the best video game system for sports games.  You'd think Sega would have continued the trend of releasing quality sports games for the Saturn, but they didn't.  Another disappointment.  Everyone likes to point out that the Playstation is the video game system with the highest amount of crappy games.  That's only because Sega gave up halfway through the competition with the Playstation.  Argue with me if you must, but the Saturn was basically dead by the end of 1997.  The Playstation was just getting warmed up by that point.  If the Saturn had continued to compete with the Playstation until say, the year 2000, the Saturn probably would've ended up with JUST as many horrible games.  Sega gave up in 1997 when it finally dawned on them that Sony was putting them out of business.  Mostly jealous Sega fanboys like to point out the high amount of terrible Playstation games, while Playstation fans correctly understand that you have to sort through a lot of junk to get to the GOOD games- and believe me, the Playstation had a LOT of good games.  In fact, the best Playstation games are better than the best Saturn games, in my opinion.  Give me Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2 over Nights and Shining Force III ANY day.  It's a shame Sega fans will never stop defending the Saturn with the same old argument.  Time to give it a rest.  In case you haven't noticed already, it bothers me that Sega fans don't seem to mind all the junk that was released for the Saturn and instead point out all the crappy games available for the Playstation.  That's like saying the mosquitos in Miami aren't NEARLY as bad as the ones in Tampa Bay.  Doesn't make much sense does it?  So why am I defending the Playstation's crappy games?  Because I find it a little bit inaccurate (and rude, to be honest) that Sega fans completely ignore the crappy games available for the Saturn and instead focus on the crappy games for the Playstation 1.  I just want to point out that yes, the Saturn DOES have its share of horrible games as well, despite what Sega fans would like you to believe.  I think Sega fans are confused when they say overall, Saturn games feature less loading times than the Playstation.  For a supposedly powerful video game system, you sure had to wait a LONG time to play a game on the Saturn.  For example, you have to sit there for an eternity to play games like WWF: Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game and Mortal Kombat Trilogy.  Compare those loading times to the same games on the Playstation, and the wait isn't NEARLY as inconvenient.  What makes the lengthy loading times on the Sega Saturn even MORE frustrating is how, right after the "now loading" screen goes away, the screen turns black for a few seconds making you wait even LONGER.  There's no 3-seconds of blackness on the Playstation.  The *very* second the loading screen goes away on ANY Playstation game, the actual game comes in.  Sega fans like to pretend those few additional seconds of loading aren't happening.  Trust me Sega fans, I DO notice them.  I DO realize that I'm waiting 3 extra unnecessary seconds to play the darn game.  The Saturn is MUCH worse when it comes to loading times.  It's SO slow.  None of this matters anyway, because by the end of 1997 loading times were almost completely gone anyway!  If only the Saturn had survived long enough to see that.  Besides the loading problem, most of the time the Playstation had the superior version when the same game was released for both systems.  This was because the graphics were always clean and sparkly on the Playstation.  On the Saturn, after they finished creating a game it was like they rubbed the graphic engine in the dirt.  Either that, or the person who put the colors in all the Saturn games could only see in black and white.  All the bland, colorless backgrounds on most Saturn games make me feel like I'm digging a hole to China.  Poor, severely-dated graphics.  For a good example, compare the two versions of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  Once again, the Playstation version smears it.  The Saturn version features ugly, grainy and ugly-colored graphics.  If a game appears on both the Saturn and Playstation, compare the graphics and I guarantee the Playstation version will look better.  I can think of only one thing the Saturn did better than Sony- the CD Player built into the system is actually more interesting on the Saturn.  On the Playstation it's just a boring, predictable layout of hitting "Play" "Pause" "Forward" etc.  On the Saturn you have a LOT more options, and the neat-looking background showing a countless amount of shooting stars is pretty impressive to watch while you sit back and listen to the music from the CD you put on.  None of this means the actual quality of the CD player on the Saturn is better- just that the outer space background and addition of more options makes it LOOK better.  They both play CD's very well.  It's a shame the Saturn couldn't hang with the big boys.  It couldn't hang around long enough to see sequels to many popular games such as Resident Evil, Mega Man and Tomb Raider.  All those sequels went to the Playstation and turned out to be VERY successful.  If a game like Resident Evil 2 had appeared on the Saturn, who knows how successful it would have been.  Sony seriously put a hurtin' on Sega.  Funny how the Playstation's gray-colored ordinary-looking system design is actually more attractive than the Saturn's silky-black "cool" color.  What's that expression?  Never judge a book by its cover.  Right!  I think back to that Sega commercial ten years ago showing a Playstation falling from a building and a guys voice saying "fly, play thing, fly".  hahahahahahahahaHAHAHA!!!	-1
Bought a used game that was promised to work but came in a replacement jewel case and was completely scratched up. Game starts but never loads to menu screen. Returning and hoping for better luck with a different copy.	-1
NBA Street Volume 2 is an amazing game.  I just received the wrong game.  I'll be sending back for a refund.	-1
I hate to dog the Taz name but Taz-Mania totally whomped. It was way too easy and really boring and repetitive. There was a few funny things that you could make Taz do but at the same time, if that's all you wanted was to see Taz do and say some funny stuff, you were better off watching a Taz cartoon. O.k. here are the games weak points, you're Taz and your job is to run around the highway(?!) and catch chickens and eat them. And that's it. Oh yeah, you dodge cars and stuff and you also run away from a female Taz but the second she catches you and she always does, you lose. Again totally lame, skip it and find another outlet if you have a Taz fiend. Seriously, if you want a good Looney Tunes game, check out Looney Tunes B-Ball. It's a lot funnier and it's a better Looney Tunes game in general.	-1
Every time I order this product, the company sends me NBA Street the first one. I've ordered this game four times. I've given up on this game. Send it to HELL!	-1
Don't expect any realism in this game. After all the reviews I thought this was the best thing to ever happen to video game basket ball. It's alot like the old NBA JAM games for super nintendoexcept instead of two on two its three on three. You do pretty much the same tricks over and over again on each possesion and then dunk the ball. Sure the dunks look cool and nothing is better than throwing the ball off your friends head but after a while its all the same. There is no goal tending so the best thing is to have a 7 footer like shaq just guarding the basket. since its first to 21 pts (normal shot=1 pt, long range =2 pts) during a regular game you can get at least 2 blocks, most likely 7 or 8. In addition to the score of the game you get pts for doing scoring. There isn't a good was to explain this except give an example. After doing a couple tricks then dunking you would get about 50000 pts. For just shooting the ball (no dunk) you get around 50 pts. three pointer will give you 250 pts. These pts add up and at the end of each individual game you get reward pts. Reward pts can be used at the store to unlock hidden features. The only thing a team needs to be excellent is to have a person who handles well ( so during tricks the ball doesn't get knocked loose) and a big man. During game play, you fill your game braker meter by doing tricks. Fill it once to do a level one game breaker. If you choose not to use it you can pocket it and fill it again to do a level 2 gamebreaker. Level one game breakers add 1 pt to your score and take away a pt from the opponent for a shot from inside the three pt line. you can shoot a three and get two pts and have one pt taken away from the opponent. The downside of just shooting threes is that you get a lot higher score for dunks (if you do a level two gamebreaker after a couple tricks and dunk it could get as much as 500000 pts). One really nice feature is the be a legend mode where you create a player and pick up a few teammates and take them to the street for pick up games (as opposed to the regular nba mode) If you finish the nba mode first you can build a better begining player to play with, but for more of a challenge you can start out fresh. You go to courts and play the best the city has to offer. It has alot of games to play before you finish so it'll take around 10 hrs to play. A major flaw to me is that players can't be traded. Western Conference teams made alot of moves during the offseason and we can't play with the new teams. That means lakers don't play with payton and malone, timberwolves won't have sprewell or cassell Robinson is still on the spurs and so on. The game is a good game to play with friends but after a while its just boring.	-1
Tony hawk2 is a great game, but if you are good at thps, espescially thps2, this is not a game for you. Not. While its fun for a while, it gets really easy to beat. after a while (3 days) i was able to beat the game with any character in 20 minutes. however, if you don't intend to play this game all the time, maybe only on roadtrips or during a plane flight, then its great. good graphics, good sound, nice cheats, but the controls are somewhat lacking. gameplay is downright bad. don't think im some jerk, though, i loved this game at first. its just too dang easy and repetetive. get advance wars.	-1
before i played the demo of this game,i thought it would be awesome,like a better version of rune from the ps2,but alas,i was sorely disapointed. I was looking forward to the fast paced action that made the movie gladiator exciting to watch but this game is turn based. Turn based! what were they thinking. I know there aren't that many turn based games around so its a change of pace from the norm,but why on such a cool looking game?i was sorely disapointed.	-1
Wow i honestly expected more from Lucasarts, but this game is by far the worst game i've ever played in my entire life...and i'm not being overly dramatic. Not only are the graphics disturbingly horrible, the voice acting is dull and repetitive. The story is interesting but it's random...like really, REALLY, random. Add to this is the games mind numbingly boring combat scheme that makes dragon age feel like call of duty, and the ridiculously jacked up money/store system. And perhaps the worst element of all...the music; the music only has ONE TRACK, that is played over, and over, and over, and over, and OVER!!! When my sister and i played this, the music got so annoying that we turned the music volume to zero. This game could have been so much better. No wonder Lucasarts decided to not make anymore medieval-themed games.	-1
This game should be in the Platinum Hits sections.  No, make that the Old Copper Penny section.  Paying anything over 10 bucks for this game would be a mistake.  Only hardened RPGers will like this game (you know the type--the guys who sit over by themselves and even the computer nerds won't talk to them).  After  Sudeki, Fable & Jade Empire comes out, Gladius will be relegated to the Bargin Bin right next to Pong.  Anywho...this game is about as much fun as visiting a friend's dying grandmother in an old folks home (unless of course, you enjoy that sort of thing).	-1
I wonder who was the genius who came up with the idea of glorifying and incorporating hip-hop style violence into a video game whose target audience is made up of teenagers?  This game also shows that it is fun to beat up on women.  There's already enough gang violence in our nation's inner cities, we don't need little suburbanites to follow in the example of violent criminals.	-1
Trash...barely works.	-1
"Twisted Metal: Black" is an extremely violent game, beyond that of most first-person-shooter video games and war games. As one example, driving after intentionally hitting someone then the game has the person stuck in your front bumper as you drive around. Yick!	-1
When you first start playing TMB, you will be saying to yourselve, "WOW", until you play it for 1 or 2 hours straight, and then realize that it wasn't want you expected.  One reason why the twisted metal series was so great, was new innovation to the car combat genre.  unfortunately no new innovation has added to this game, in fact you could stay it going downhill.  The game lack so much stuff that make all the other series look like winner.  What the game lack isn't in it graphic department, but it most important aspect of any game, the gameplay.  It fast, infact it super fast, how can a 16 wheeler go as fast as a motorcycle, and realize how lame and such a poor excuse the developer of this game made it.  The car physic is probably the worst i have ever seen.  It never feel like your actually driving on the ground, every car has the same physic driving.  Instead of driving like any other game, it drive more like on ice and hovercraft style.  It lame, and also it very hard to hit your opponent.  Also every game is a handicap game, not only do the al don't shoot each other but that all the al are all trying to destory you.  It doesn't take long before a barrage of missle is aiming for your cars.  This take so much away from the game, that for beginner will be totally outwhelmed.  It also pretty hard on the easy setting because every game is a handicap games.  Now talk about going downhill, there is no replay, extra, and no clear objective to any of the mission, but rather on objective and that is to destroy how many cars the game want you to destroy.  Put in bad graphic and poor gameplay with an unexcusable 14 cars only, and you get a poor quality of a twisted metal game that the only thing going for it was the hype.	-1
Twisted Metal: Black may not be easy, not much in the way for cheats as compared to Twisted Metal 4 (including access to the bosses)	-1
This game was a sinch to beat,its boring and it doesn't deserve to be rated.  Thats all I have to say.	-1
I'm going to forego my usual in-depth reviews for this game. We all know what Twisted Metal is and this is nothing more than a rehash of those same games. Here's why: Pros: Excellent Graphics Cool Mini-movies Endurance & Challenge levels are interesting Good to pass time with Cons: Short game with small levels Repetitious gameplay Boring endings to each character Same old rehash of earlier TM games Not enough "total-destruction" of buildings and such for this type of game. If you want to be "burned-out" by a game, I recommend "Burnout, Test Drive, and Twisted Metal: Black." Not worth the money. A renatal at best.	-1
works but didn't come with a battery cover ...was not told this would happen if so i would have bought it from another seller	-1
only worked for gb games not gba have tried using multiple gba pokemon games and none of them worked	-1
I forgot how terrible these are.  You can't even see the screen.  There is nothing about this that is fun.	-1
I bought this for my mom because she likes the original, and hers was in horrible condition. (hers was broken from ALOT of years of use) The screen is dark and hard to see, even with the worm light i bought for it.  Unless you're like my mom and prefer the original, i would go for the SP version because they made a built in light (backlight) it does cost more but it's definately worth it in the end. I have never had any "hand cramping issues" though i suppose if you play too long on any of these units that would happen.  They're discontinuing the sp from what i understand, but you can still find what you need online.	-1
I would give this game a perfect 5 but I'm amazed at how dark the screen is! When I first turned it on I could barely see anything. I had to sit next to a bright light and awkwardly hold it up. This is a MAJOR flaw. No matter how good the game is it will never live up to it's full potential thank to the GBA's poor lighting. That aside, the GBA's graphics are amazing after playing the old Game Boy. The Super Nintendo graphics are still welcome in the hands of gamers and the audio is surprising good. The screen size should be bigger but with color and great graphics the picture is still easy to see. That is, if you've got a bright light to sit next to.	-1
I've tried the cable out with my cousins, and we have not found any games that have let us play two player yet.  I left the cable with my cousins knowing they had more than one gameboy advance, suggesting that perhaps the games have got to be exactly the same in each system.  I am still unaware of any two player games they may have gotten to work.	-1
As you'll probably know, civilization continues and here's the newest version of the game known as civ3. Now don't get too excited about this game, as more often, you never know how it will end up as. I know, i know, it's enjoyable but just like civ1 and 2 were, i don't really think civ3 will make any difference. Gameplay and graphics changed a little bit from civilization 1 to 2. But overall, everything is the same. Whoever made this game is a person who likes to cheat people into buying this game and wasting their money on some garbage. I'd suggest buyers think more often about the sims and simcity 3000 and if they have these games, they should be thankful to themselves. Thank you.	-1
Now I know what you are going to say,"Why did you buy this game unsure if it was compatible or not?".Well I had done a little research and thought that, "Just maybe" this game would play on my PC.Okay my "PC" is an asus netbook but I had upgraded the RAM and felt that I had the system requirements met. Boy was I wrong!!!I was only able to install and get to the start screen,after that nothing. Okay I figured,I'll just download Win 7's xp mode. Again start screen and then nothing. I know this is a phenomenal game from all I have read I just wish I could play it. I might even go so far as to buy the OS-X version and put it on my Macbook Pro but not for now. From now on I am making SURE games are compatible before pusrchase.	-1
There are few games that have made me this angry, I cannot believe how unfair this game is.  The resources are bull man, I never get salt paper and even if the computer has extra it refuses to trade with me, doesn't matter though I'd bring a ton of cavalries into japan and I'll just get chopped to bits by their samuri which seem to never end.  It seems like no matter how superior your units are the comp can just tear them up with it's endless supply of grunt units, it ain't right...  I loved Civ 2 back in the day and mastered it.  But this game is unforgiving, the diplomacy is a complete headache, if you want something you have to pay an arm and a leg and you have to give away all your secrets.  I don't know, I liked 2 better, maybe 4 is good but my computer sucks... ugh.  Don't waste your time.	-1
Get Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, the true heir to Civ 2 instead.  It's a game which trumphs this one in all respects except the trivial ones(like graphics).	-1
Here are its problems:  1.  The AI:  The AI cheats!  On any setting beyond chieftan (easiest) you will generally never be able to keep up with the production and military might of the game's AI controlled civs.  The most powerful nation on the map will always be the AI controlled civ.  Its military will be bigger, it will expand faster, it will beat you to great wonders, out perform you in the tech tree race, and it will more likely than not eventually single you out for extinction.  2.  Units: Much negative criticism has been directed at the game's unit imbalances and it's all true.  The game's units are terribly unbalanced--all of which is exacerbated by the random nature (random meaning more often than not resolving battles in the AI's favor) of combat.  3.  Diplomacy:  Again, terrible.  Other civs make ridiculous and uneven demands and make it ridiculously difficult to engage in mutually benificial negotiations.  It is very easy to find yourself at war simply because you rebuffed a demand for tribute.  4.  Did I mention the unit imbalance?  5.  Combat:  Managing your units is tedious and burdensom. Its awfully irritating to have to manually select unit after unit after unit to move across the map.  A patch helps a little, adding the option of fortify or wake all, but it's too little.  Also, this game generally frowns on your civ being too miliaristic and aggressive.  Your citizens should be assuaged by the fact that they stand to reap the spoils of your regime if you are successful in combat but instead, often despite the type of government, they turn all whiny if you play the combat hand too much.  This seems out of place in a game ostensibly designed to simulate WAR!!!  6.  Cities:  You lose a city (a valuable city loaded with painstakingly developed improvments) to an enemy.  You fight to get it back because of its strategic value.  Almost all the stuff you built is gone, save for a granary.  Gee, thanks.  7.  Population mood:  Okay, I'm playing peaceful, but with a large military just in case.  My government of choice is Monarchy or Republic.  I get attacked.  I'm ready.  I'm putting the big smack-down on my invader (and the one or two AI controlled civs that inevitably pile on).  Suddenly, five or six turns into the battle, every single one of my cities falls into revolt.  The reason:  "Give peace a chance."  Excuse me, I was attacked.  The game seems to relish punishing the player by forcing you into classical darned if you darned if you don't.  8.  Realism:  Someone mentioned the pollution problems you experience later in the game.  They are right on. It becomes a downright pain to constantly micromanage workers sending them from one pollution hot-spot to another.  The AI civs always seem to locate themselves in a primo spot, next to all kinds of goodies like luxuries, raw resources, fertile land.  The human player?  Right next to the mountains and desert.  Roam around a few turns to find a better spot and you're behind everyone else for the duration of the game.  At the end of the day, Civ 3 commits the ultimate sin by not being what it says it is: an epic game designed so you can match wits with other opponents all in a quest to dominate the world.  Civ 3's shortcomings are also not what you'd call obvious and apparent.  You could play for a few hours and say, what are they talking about--this games is great.  No, Civ 3s shortcomings hide in the details--that area that separates great games from the bad--and come to forefront as you play.  Though I admit, for moments, this game is outright brilliant (hence 3 stars for fun), but one simply cannot overlook such fatal flaws.  What could be the best turn-based strategy game ever made is instead beset by just enough flaws to make it nothing more than a lie encompassed on disc, with just enough unattainable potential to keep you coming back for a fresh kick in the teeth.  Not me though.  After over a year of frustrations and lemons-into-lemonade travails, I've uninstalled Civ 3 and given it a one-way ticket to the back corner of my office clost.	-1
Pro's: - Tons of fun at the higher ages. - Requires good strategy and logical thinking skills. - Lets you rebuild history. Con's: - Takes a VERY long time to get to a higher age. - Imbalanced combat. Example: My military advisor told me to get archers because they're better than warriors; then when my archer engaged in combat with a warrior he was easily defeated by the warrior. - Half of the time you're going to be hitting spacebar to skip your turn. - No online/multiplay capabilites (unless you waste your money on an expansion). - Can't choose a starting age. - No campaign/story mode. - Can sometimes take way too long to finally finish a game. Final Verdict: The cons outnumber the pro's and even though this game can be quite fun at times, it has way too many major issues and if you want them fixed then you'll need to pay extra money for expansion packs.	-1
This game does not draw you in. It is somehow less enticing than Civ II. It is cold, distant, and impersonal, and feels like the rival Call to Power. I hate to admit it, but Call to Power is better than this version of Civ., because call to power has neat stuff, such as underwater and space colonies. I did not find any cool units in this game, nor any cool concepts. "Culture" is a trick. It does not enrich the game, and often makes the conquest of cities frustrating because citizens rebel and overthrow you--give me a break. What this game calls "culture" is an empty word. Apparently you have to build temples in all your cities and feverishly construct "wonders of the world" to gain culture. Slow and uninspring, this game lacks any new imagination. There has been no progress made since Civ II in terms of spicing the game up and making it more interesting.	-1
I am not faint of heart nor am I unschooled in playing pc games - there was a time when I played Civ II so much I could barely get to work the next day.  This incarnation of the game looked and sounded fun so I bought it based on the raves I heard....  The graphics are fun, its nice to have everything in 3D but that is about the only upside to this game. The things that I was looking forward to the most, new trade and diplomacy options, are a bust.  Trade is easier now but you just really cannot get anything useful out of it.  Trade does not function well.  You have to have a sea route or a land route to an AI country to trade with it.  Once there is a sea route you and the AI need harbors.  But the AI's don't build harbors for centuries, even when they can.  For a land route, you have to build a road. You can expect that the closest AI will also always be your enemy so good luck trading with them or though them (you can but you lose the route when you go to war with your neighbor. All the AI's almost always demand more than the trade is worth.  Then they are very happy to drop trading with you and trade amongst themselves, cutting the human player out totally. Trade and diplomacy are inextricably linked now.  This gets to the biggest disappointment - diplomacy worked much better in Civ 2.  Diplomacy is a misnomer in this game.  AI's demand, you basically have to give in.  You ask and MAYBE can get what you want by giving up everything you have, only to have the AI become annoyed or furious with you anyway.  This is not because I do not know how to negotiate - I do it for a living, you just cannot get anything but a bad deal in this game. So that leaves just waging war mostly. Here, the game has picked up one of the more unfortunatel traits of Civ 2.  The AI's do not have to build any city improvements BUT YOU DO TO KEEP YOUR PEOPLE HAPPY.  The upshot is that they have the time and the money to spend building armies that you MUST devote to building other things.  A few good tactical victories during the inevitable war usually gets the AI to the peace table but you have to start rebuilding everything destroyed from scratch wasting more time and money. The AI just goes back to building Wonders and military units and then blitzes you with dozens of units the next time around.  It becomes dull and repetitous. I would have been happier if they had just taken Civ 2 and improved the graphics -  that would have been enough.  Instead they ruined the game.  Now, I am mostly just bored by Civ 3.	-1
I bought this thinking I'd find a new game, with new units, with some interesting changes from the previous two versions. Instead, I got Civilization that was released in the early 90s with new graphics. There is nothing new that I would justify this being called a sequal.  This is simply a re-make of a great game.  It's not worth the investment in the high price they are asking for this item.	-1
The eclipsing star of the computer gaming world, Sid Meyer, resurfaces to serve up a game that is every bit as exciting as watching lint accumulate.  Basically a re-warnmed version of his earlier title, "Alpha Centauri" (a game now in re-release, which will put you back 9 bucks), but without all the cool movies that AC offered, Civilization 3 has all the action of glacial movement, the excitement of a six-hour monotonal history lecture, and all the visual appeal of a mid-80's DOS game.   After buying this game, I popped it into the drive, booted it up, and five minutes later, was wishing that I had bought something more exciting- like a program that would monitor the growth of my fingernails.  I've played a lot of games- and over a game-playing hobby that has stretched over the past two decades, I cannot remember a title that was so underwhelming, so dissapointing, and so downright boring.	-1
Civilization II is my all time favorite computer game. When I lost that game when a computer virus damaged my hard drive I recieved the Third edition of this series. And what a utter crock of $h! t. I am so dissapointed I am almost crying in disbelief. There are so many thing that completely ruin the qualities of this so called game. First you can't bribe rival units. Second, there is no cheat mode to toggle. Third there is no complete it button to spend money to build improvements, units, or wonders. God, is there no end to this sorry story. I felt so excited when I got this game for my birthday but when I installed it all it did was crash almost a few minutes after starting and it wrecked my hard drive. Needless to say is that this is nothing but a computer wrecking hunk of garbage. I personally am going to the computer store and am buying a replacement copie of the Second civilization. This one on the other hand will be sitting on the shelf and collecting dust or heading to the garbage can. Maybe if my computer is fixed and upgraded this game will be playable and given a higher rating but from where things stand right now this is one of the biggest dissapointments ever. For those who are rushing out to buy this: Stick with your older versions because all this one will do is eat up hard drive space and ruin your hard drive.	-1
After about a week of playing, I'm getting more and more upset with Civ 3.  Here are some of my latest gripes: - The Culture Effect seems to have problems.  In one game, even though I'd built 16 out of 24 Great Wonders and 7 out of 10 Small Wonder, and my Culture, at over 40,000, was almost 3 times that of any other player (according to the Histograph), I no longer took over cities right next to me.  Plus, in a war, I kept losing cities that I'd taken over even though they were filled with MY troops, all rebels had been eliminated, I was running under a Democracy (thus immune to Propaganda), and all the people were happy (w/ some as entertainers).  Plus, when those cities deposed my Governor, my own national military units just disappeared.  This is very upsetting. - The inability (or more precisely, poor ability) to make actual armies is horrible.  First, you can't produce leaders, they just appear (if you're lucky).  Secondly, once you have a leader, you can only stack 3 units with him.  So, for the majority of the time, you're stuck building individual units and just sending them in a stream to wherever you need to fight.  Combined arms is totally missing. - Corruption makes an empire-building game impossible.  I took over another continent.  I was ruling under a Diplomacy (From the manual:  "One of Democracy's greatest advantages is its ability to squelch corruption and waste.  Both are minimal in your cities.").  I had Courthouses in every city (it's the second thing I build, right after the Temple).  I'd built the Forbidden Palace (which is supposed to lower corruption, though my Capitol was still on my first continent).  Upon checking one of my new cities, I found that corruption was eating up 12 out of the 13 shields the city produced.  That's a 92% corruption rate.  With that kind of corruption, there's no point in ever owning more than a dozen cities. - Units from previous Eras can still damage more modern units.  I can't count the number of times a single enemy spearman has killed my tanks.  This is totally unacceptable. - Diplomacy seems to be brain dead.  My opponents don't seem to pay any attention to my past behavior in determining what they're going to do to me.  I spend the whole game sharing technology, resources, luxuries, maps, etc with these people and all of a sudden, out of the blue, they declare war on me.  I'm not sure how to phrase this.  But, they act without any moral feeling (just like computers, I suppose [g]). - Resource distribution is horrible.  In one game, only one player in the entire world had rubber.  Plus, because Trade has been "simplified" to the point of disappearance, there's no real insight into how much you've got or when it will dry up.  So far, it doesn't even look like the amount you have has anything to do with production.  If you have it, it seems you can make as much of something as you want at a time until the resource dries up.  In a game I just finished, I was the only one in the entire world to have Saltpeter, Iron and Aluminum (and the Iron didn't show up until late in the game).  Also, even though I could see Rubber, Oil and Coal on the map in other nations, none of these showed up for trade until late in the game.  All of those resources appeared linked via roads to cities on the coast.  Is the AI so brain-dead that it doesn't ever build itself some Harbors for trade? - The times when resources show up need to be modified.  In my last game, apparently, I was one or two Ages ahead of everyone else.  I needed things like Aluminum, Rubber, and Oil but they were nowhere to be found.  In a frustrating episode, I had Aluminum long enough to complete all but three parts for my Alpha Centauri ship.  But, while I was researching my last advance, my Aluminum "mine" dried up.  There was no Aluminum anywhere on the planet.  I finally figured out that if I gifted a nation with all the technology it needed to advance one or two ages up to, and including, the Rocketry advance, the would finally see Aluminum and put it on the market (I ended up giving that nation 12 to 15 technologies).  This is dumb.  There needs to be some mechanism to allow me to tell some relatively primitive society that I'll buy that shiney rock from it.  Of course, the best way would be to just show ALL resources ALL the time. - Espionage is WAY too expensive.  Doing anything worthwhile, correctly, usually costs thousands of dollars.  I rarely have more than 1,000 available.  Also, it doesn't make sense.  I tried finding a mole in one of MY cities.  I failed and a nation declared war on me.  Why should my trying to clean up MY ranks bother anyone else?  Plus, why should I have to specifically say to do this, and pay for it?  Once I build the Spy Agency, this should be standard operating procedure. I've got another 1,000 words or so of complaints.  But, I'm out of space.	-1
Civ III is much anticipated and I would say quite disapointing.  Civ II had a number of unballanced aspects (howitzers that won ever engagement and railroads that allowed instant transport to name a few).  However, it was a good simulation of cultural development.  Civ III lacks many of the key technological improvements of Civ II (no rail so you always use the same roads that you built in 3000 BC and no improvments in agriculture) that makes the game less fun.  They should have made the game more ballanced but still kept the flow of history that made it great before.	-1
For people like me who loved the previous Sid Meier Civilization games, Civ3 is a bitter disappointment. There are two seemingly paradoxical reasons for this: not enough has changed, and too much has changed. On the one hand, there have been very few improvements to interface and gameplay. All the things you liked about Civ2 will be too familiar to seem fun, and all the things you disliked about Civ2 are still there and just as frustrating as they ever were. The AI is still berserkly aggressive and will attack you constantly, even when it has no hope of winning and even when there's nothing to be gained from fighting. There is a way to group units to simplify movement, but it is only available as a random result of combat (leaders) or as a capability of a rather high-level tech (military academies) that does not become available until relatively late in the game. Thus, moving armies around remains a tedious and time-consuming process of giving go-to orders to each unit individually. Master of Magic allowed you to group units for movement back in 1994. Why does Civ3 still withhold this obvious labor-saving measure 7 years later? Most of the time, this game looks, feels, and plays just like Civ2 did. On the other hand, building almost all military units now requires the player to acquire access to certain "strategic resources." This is an interesting idea in theory, but the concept was implemented so severely that it cripples the game. For example, if the random map generator did not happen to place an iron mine near your starting position, you will not be able to build swordsmen, gunmen, frigates, canon, or even build railroads across your empire. You may have researched techs well into the modern era, and still have to fend your enemies off with longbows and spears because the resource rules won't allow you to build more sophisticated units. On their website the game's designers say they intended for players to be able to trade with other civilizations to acquire these neccesary supplies. Anybody who's tried to negotiate diplomatically with the previous Civ games' AI rivals knows how laughable this is: you're expected to rely upon good-faith trading with those same guys who delcare war on you every few turns! And without a source of strategic resources, you can not build any of the worthwhile military units and your aggressive AI rivals will eat you alive. It's just that simple. Complicating matters is the fact that the number of strategic resource tiles is proportional to the number of players in the game. The larger the map you play on, the harder it will be to find just those few terrain squares that have the essential resources. Since I prefer to play on large maps, I found myself unable to acquire iron in most of the games I played, and I never, not even ONCE found a source of saltpeter on my starting continent, which in Civ3 means no muskets and no canon. (Civ3 shipped with an editor that is supposed to allow you to alter the rules to your liking, but I'm afraid that when I tried this the game crashed.) The result is that it no longer matters how happy your people are, which techs you've researched, and which wonders you've built. Despite its name, this game is no longer about building a prosperous and happy "Civilization." Winning or losing Civ3 depends solely on the blind luck of being granted a source of strategic resources by the map generator. If you want to fight over a few scattered resource tiles essential to mere survival, then buy Civ3. But if you want to manage and grow a prosperous empire, save yourself $ and break out your old copy of Civ2.	-1
Oooh! Horrible Horrible game! I saw reviews here way before the game was released. Come on have you played it before you gave it 5 stars? Just the prospect of the game? Feel free to spend your money and see how it stacks up to CTP2. Of course, Call to Power 2 was not perfect but this is abysmal. You WILL notice that the playability is extremely hard and vague compared to Activision's CTP2. Wars are strange with no stacking and each soldier fights another one!! How realistic is that? Trading is so vague with no idea of what's going on unlike CTP2 where trade routes are clearly shown. Diplomacy is also toothless and you do not get to compose a message nicely like you can in CTP. And there are many more instances that show Sid Meier is losing his touch or he doesn't have enough resources to hire enough programmers and do a good job. Mark my words, you would be better off saving your money for CTP3!!	-1
I waited for this game since the very early planning stages (about four years ago), participated in the developer chats, muddled through the website updates, was very active in the forum and community, and made several good friends which I still keep in touch to this day, even though we never played the game together. Why didn't we? Cornered Rat Software (CRS) promised the world, and failed horribly. I could write a five-page essay on why this game deserves such a low rating, but since that will ust pile on the 'not helpful' reviews, I will keep it to a couple paragraphs. The game WILL NEVER be complete. CRS has chosen to do 'map updates' which erase everything that happened every so often which leaves neither side unable to win, and this is not a big fun FPS, it is nothing more then capture the flag on a large scale. The graphics and sound are abysmal to state it very plainly. It looks like this could be played on a Playstation or Nintendo 64, but wait, there is more. In spite of the terrible graphics and cartidrige-quality sound, you need a monster system to play this on 512mb RAM will let you fly planes. I understand that in a MMOLG you need to make sacrifices, but not on a scale like this. Ill stop now, there have been constant updates and patches, and I have tried so hard to like this game, but it is nothing that was orignally promised. The sinister backstory behind its' release is another review upon itself. All I can say is stay away for a year and although everything will be severly out f date, by that time this game might just be what they orignally promised it would. The only reason I gave it we must wait and see what happens in a year or so, but I am not keeping my fingers crossed, and am having a blast with Ghost Recon online.	-1
Although this game seems quite promising, it is just a mess of bugs, frustrating load-times, and huge patches.  First off, the graphics are quite mediocre.  The building walls are paper thin and there is really nothing to the buildings other than four walls.  The characters are blocky and all of the action looks quite silly most of the time. Hopefully, you enjoy long load times.  Waiting for the game to boot up and let you into the server literally takes 2-5 minutes.  Even the offline mode takes a good 2-5 minutes to load.  And this is with a system that surpasses the recommended system configurations (I am running a P3-800mhz, 256MB SDRAM, 32MB Video, 40xCD-ROM, and Cable Modem).  Also, the game says it only requires a 56k modem to play, but even with a cable modem I experience terrible lag in big battles.  Also, you'll hate your 56k connection when it comes to downloading patches (last patch I downloaded was about 70 MB!). The gameplay itself isn't too much fun either.  It is pointless to try and go foot-soldier seeing as how EVERYBODY uses tanks!  Trying to be infantry will get you either run over or killed in one good tank blast.  Since you're able to just select what to use in battle, is it any wonder that this game has become a war of tanks?  In the whole time I've played I only come across infantry when it's the person's very first time playing. After that they quickly learn to just use the tanks.  Knowing who to kill will be frustrating as well.  Everyone's name in the game is blue, and although you cannot damage an ally, you will spend a considerable amount of time shooting at the wrong targets. All in all, the game is terrible.  Fighting the battles is aggrevating, but not as aggrevating as finding a battle to fight (there are no NPCs, so you have to find other players to fight).  On many servers you'll notice the Allies are quite outnumbered by the Axis.  Every battle I have played has been won by the Germans.  The game is just chaos, no structure, no commanding officers (unless doing missions, and not really even then).  It's basically jump-in, shoot, die, jump back in, shoot some more, die again.  There's no real goal or purpose.  No medals to be awarded and no real benefits to acheiving a high rank.	-1
Just a warning for any buyers that the server for this game has had HUGE problems and has crashed numerous times!  Apparently, the server was never tested with the amount of people that would be playing online.  Right now, the company is putting a hold on free one-month trial accounts as most people have yet to play the game online. I would wait a few months before purchasing this title.  In the age of internet financial disasters, this is another title that was rumored to have been rushed into production because of limited income.  (In other words, the game wasn't tested enough to make sure it would work right.) The game looks fun and exciting if it works, but I would check out internet bulletin boards or news sources before purchasing this game (and the monthly online payments) to make sure everything is satisfactory.	-1
Creators need to lay off that funny tasing water (not tasting).Evidently in my view they decided to try to made this look good for some green.i Bet im not making any sense...... )(to the point)(   This game is way to short,I finished it in just 2 days times (during the weekend).The campaign can also be very boring and it get very tiring intercepting mostly light mechs and it gets hard to get heavy mechs except the ones that become available about every 3 missions.   Too many new mechs and not many of the old ones...Dont know how they could leave out the Nova Cat...Needs a little work yet. Unlike other games such as Force commander and Ages of Empire and MechCommander now when theres a lag spike and u click somwhere when that lag spike is over it doesnt count your click...The light mechs need more room for more weapons i know they are light mechs but they need more than only like 3 lasers and 1 lrm. )(to the good things)( Over all the game completely blows in single player. However,the multiplayer allows very active play and all mechs more availabilitys more maps. Mostly all the good there is. Very good 3D graphics and the Artillary is ok too... )(few more bad things)(   I would be so much happier if this game had a instant action. This is one of those games that are made for instant action but this has none. Kinda untalented...Almost all the games from the Mech Warrior series have had a instant action. Really strange that this one doesnt... )(the end im off to play MechCommander and MechWarrior4 and MW3... Far away from the good rating of a must buy. Dont buy!<BR...	-1
I would like to be able to write a review for Mech Commander 2, but I am unable to play this game on any computer in my house. It seems that Microsoft has chosen to add a copy-protect program-- "SafeDisc"-- to render the CD-ROM incompatible with every single drive I have. A readme file included with Mech Commander warns the user of this problem, when it is too late. Unfortunately, Microsoft neither includes a warning on the box, nor posts a list of incompatible drives on the Web-- as of this writing. Those who have not yet purchased Mech Commander 2 should be aware that, among many other drives, the CD-ROM fails with the following: Sony CDU5211, Sony CDU77E, Acer CD-624a, Memorex CD-RW2224, Plextor CD-ROM PX-32TS (SCSI), Sanyo CRD-256P, and the Yamaha 2216E, 4416SX, and CDR6416S-VK. The full list is probably much longer. Microsoft does indicate that the Sony CDU77E should work if it is configured as a master drive, but all of the others listed are right out. I am personally going to contact Mircosoft about getting a replacement disc. I suspect a patch will not arrive, since this is a hardware issue, and Microsoft obviously will not do anything to override a system they just spent money to install and distribute. It may behoove the reader to write Microsoft for a full list of incompatible drives.	-1
Quake II is a first person shooter by Id software and Activision. It is the sequal to Quake, which is the first real 3D game and one of the most important game in FPS history. The plot is you play a marine in space who crashes in an alien planet. Quake2's single player gameplay is quite dull, But compared to the orginal Quake it is much better. You need to solve mission objectives to complete a level. There are 39 levels in 9 hub levels and they are as closely intertwined as Hexen's hub layout, So you need to travel back and forth to complete one hub level. There are also lots of villans to deal with, Alien mutant creatures with guns insted of hands and many others in all shapes and sizes, Unfortunatly the enemy AI is poor. There are lots of weapons too and even the first weapon is a blaster gun with infinte ammo, No Axe here. I Played Quake2 on the default OpenGL video mode, The graphics are very good and the game runs very well, Even faster than Quake. But the charecters don't look real and the game looks cartoony. Quake2 has a very good multiplayer gameplay, The connection, maps, weapons and the multiplayer options are a great improvement from the first game. Quake2's single player game is quite bad but the multiplayer gameplay is very good.	-1
Showed up on time, great condition, worked flawlessly.  Just one problem, I didn't like the game.  I never really grew up with PC games like most people did.  I grew up with Atari 2600, NES, SNES, etc and my family was not PC savy enough to get me a PC nor did we have the capital so I missed out on, what are considered, great PC classics, like this one.  It's a phenomenal game for PC, I just didn't like it.	-1
I bought this in a moment of weakness when there were no new first person D&D type games out there. I had been burned by other 3rd person games, but decided to see what someone else besides the Baldur's Gate people could do with things.  The game was very linear and to me, very annoying to play. I had problems with the party AI and did not like that I could not veer off the path to any extent. I got maybe halfway through it and quit. Not my cup of tea.	-1
Not only is this game linear, dumb-downed and boring, but its graphics leave something to be desired. I dl'd the demo just to check it out and was highly disappointed. I recomend Neverwinter Nights for the fan of any RPG of high merit.	-1
Don't let anyone fool you.  This game is a pure 1 dimensional dungeon crawl of epic boredom. Your first impression upon starting the game is that it really is fun, and the graphics are good, and the gameplay is nicely paced.  It was based on those same sentiments that my friends got me to buy it after they had been playing it for 2 days. Sadly, I did buy it.  By the time I had it installed, most of them were complaining that it was getting repetitive and that there wasn't much to it.  Just gather up your NPC's and keep going, boy! Really, this is a game where if you buy enough healing/mana potions, you can survive anything, since your npc's will drink for themselves, and if you get one of the healers with the group heal spell, you can kill for hours without taking a breather, if the mobs would hold out that long. Needless to say, I was finished with the game after a week, and looking for some poor sap to unload it on, because there is no replay value.  You can't make different decisions, so its a one shot deal. Stay away!	-1
This is is a game from a LONG line of diablo clones.  The basics of the game are just a rip-off from the diablo system.  The only significant difference is the addition of quite good graphics. Unfortunatly this is one of the most uninteresting games i've ever played.  I pretty much exclusivly play rpgs and i was just totally bored about 10 minutes into this game.  The plot is pretty much just meeting some schmuck on the road and he tells you something to do, so you go do it, and kill things along the way.  I mean come on...that was pretty fun at first but after Diablo, Diablo 2, and the numerous clones they spawned; that sort of thing has kind of gotten old. You can only play as a human character and theres very few modifications you can do to your characters looks (and all of those modifications are abhorantly cheesy looking). The advancement system is pretty simple, and i think thats why its boring.  If you want you character to be good in melee weapons; then you smash things with a sword.  Want an archer?  shoot things with a bow then.  Want character who can smash and shoot?  then smash things with a sword half of the time and shoot with a bow the other half. But the thing that really made me hate this game was the camera angles.  They jammed so many stupid trees and caves and mountains into the screen that you cant see ANYTHING.  you have to spend about a minute moving your camera around before you can see anything, giving yourself an epileptic seizure in the process.  I found it easist just to play the game completly in the "mega-map" mode.  In that mode all the silly graphics don't get into your way and you can actually see where you're going.  But of course in the map mode you reduce the game to commanding a dot around and telling it to kill things. The game did suprise me on how smoothly it ran.  Usually microsoft games give me alot of trouble with choppy graphics and game crashes.  But this one never crashed and was plesently smooth and fast.  Figures that the only game they make the runs smooth is the one i'm not interesting in playing... All in all if you're up for a diablo clone i'd recommend throne of darkness, forget about this waste of 1 gigabyte.  On the up side it may make a good game for children...	-1
Only two things separate this game from the pack, really. 1:  The score.  The music in this game really adds to the immersion of the game.  This, I suppose, doesn't mean all that much, since the immersion is not very compelling, but without the music it would be abysmal. 2:  Graphics.  DS is head and shoulders above Diablo 2 and Baldur's Gate (the two games it is most frequently compared to). Another review on this site says something to the effect of "this game plays itself."  I agree.  Honestly, the only enjoyment I have gotten from it is listening to the music as my beautifully rendered character walks around a beautifully rendered landscape. Trust me, though... that gets old quick, even with graphics and music as engaging as DS's. My advice:  Wait for NWN or Morrowind.	-1
What a disappointment. After 2 years of waiting, I finally get to play it, expecting another masterpiece from Chris Taylor. Instead, I get this pretty dungeon hack. Boo! Even Diablo 2 had a story in there, somewhere.	-1
OK so after my first session playing... the graphics are astounding, the game play is a little realxing but fun, its sort of Nox meets Unreal and pretends to be Diablo. But its crashes about once an hour (on a 1ghz Athlon, raid, 32MB ATI, 128MB CAS 2) irregardless of settings. And when I say crash, I mean crash, its brings not only the game but also my usually impervious win2k system to its knees. No task manger, no reset, hard power cycle only!! I don't remeber any of the Diablos crashing ever, or the Baldur's Gates... typical Microsoft, releasing something late and expensive and unfinished! There are tons of cool ideas in this game but its a bit like the original arcade Dragon's Lair once the wow factor is over you have to live with the limitations... Everyone should see this game but I wouldn't reccomend anyone actually buy it. If you're short of cash (or sensible about such things) then wait for Neverwinter Nights - most likely a much better investment...	-1
18 Wheeler is only a very average game at best.  I am a big fan of all racing games, but the action in this game is too SLOW to keep me interested. After playing through a couple of levels, I was bored with this game. The graphics do not live up to the Playstation 2, in fact this game looks more like a Playstation one game. If you enjoyed the arcade game, you may like this, but I would recommend renting this before buying it.	-1
I rented this and had to double check the box to make sure I got the PS2 game. The graphics are only OK for PS1, awful for PS2. It's not fun either. I was looking forward to smashing stuff with a big truck. You get time taken off the clock for hitting cars, and you'll never finish in the time allowed. If you don't want to have fun and just race, it's way too short. I went from NY to FL in a few minutes. You'd be better off getting ANY of the other driving games for PS2.	-1
This game doesn't make much sense in terms of the Star Wars universe.  It was clearly made to be as similar to Age of Kings as possible.  Yeah, it's pretty cool to select some Tie Fighters and tell them to attack, or to move around an At-At, but I'm sorry, Wookies, Naboo and Gungans are all lame.  It suffers from all the same problems as Age Of Kings: - Really really slow action, where everything takes forever - Sound is really bad.  It sounds sample from someone's VHS copy of Star Wars - Missions are boring - Too many units - So many resources that you spend all your time making drones to chop down trees. Additionally: - The graphics are sub-par.  The color palletes for things are not right and there's a lot of dithering.  It looks really bad. - Each "race" is essentially exactly the same as the others.  All have basically the same units and tech, with minor differences to make it appear that they "balanced" the game. Do not buy this.	-1
To the Aussie who was a little bit rude: if the game isn't out yet, how can you say it's gonna be good if the game isn't out yet? If a game like FOCOM was a lemon, and it has all the big anticipation like GBG, why should I write good things about a game similar to FOCOM ? FOCOM has a problem with compatibility with video/sounds cards, it has nothing to do with the specs of any PC, that's why everybody hated FOCOM. Try to understand first and then criticize about spelling, 'mate To the others: Yes, I haven't played the game, but is sad that a great company like LucasArts cannot come up with something better than AOE2, perhaps when the game arrives, then all reviews would be valid or not...we shall see...	-1
this games sucks..the controls r radically hard lol radically  ..you need 2 memorize like 30 different buttons 2 run, jump, crouch this n that ..im on a laptop so ..it probably made it suck on ly more lol ..honestly id rather master the kotor like 20times b4 going threw this thing	-1
"Jedi Outcast" is the third installment in the outstanding "Dark Forces" series.  Sadly, it is also the first misfire.  "Dark Forces" and "Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight" were superb games both in terms of graphics, gameplay, and story arc.  Admittedly, the graphics are good for "Jedi Outcast", but it fails miserably with gameplay.  The keyboard plays a singularly important role in any PC-based video game.  With that being fact, it's imperative that actions that keyboards performs be smooth and fluid.  It was with the two previous installments in this series, but the control is nothing short of totally aggravating.  The movement is 'herky-jerky', almost like it regressed to earlier technology.  Aiming the weapons at the targets is nearly impossible because the targets move too fast to acquire with the current setup.  Also, trying to pan the player's view up and down and from left to right is very shaky.  The gameplay is so awful that I have been forced to stop playing the game because I do not have the patience to deal with it.  I suspect the game, itself, may actually get quite good.  Unfortunately, I cannot give a rating based on how good I think the game could be if only the gameplay were better.  The fact that the game is too aggravating to continue to play dooms "Jedi Outcast" to the lowest score possible.  Perhaps the versions ported for actual gaming systems perform much better.  If they do, I will review this game much more favorably for that platform.	-1
All I have to say bout this game is that it is fun for a couple hours once you get your lightsaber.  There are some fun levels and special effects are great but....  now the con- no real replayability, once I finished it, which didn't take too long, I didn't want to play it again, and the multiplayer isn't much better than the first jedi game... I recommend waiting for Knights of the old republic to come out if you really want to lightsaber duel.  Also Star Wars Galaxies is coming out in January and will be a great online RPG- with space wars and light saber battles.	-1
LucasArts STOLE MY MONEY! this is one of the worst games i've bought in 4 years. Although the graphics may be fancy thats about it. The game play is terrible, the levels are dry, and the animations are choppy (even on my P4 256ram!!!!). Its like the only thing they focused on was pretty still pictures to lure unsuspecting gamers with screan shots. This game is JUST NOT FUN! In addition to these problems there are hundreds of bugs in this version. I believe that they released this game way to early and I would not buy this product! Save your money and please stop supporting everything they stamp a star wars logo on! STARWARS stamped across the box cannot justify such a terrible game.	-1
