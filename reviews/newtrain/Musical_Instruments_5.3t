Shorter than the stock cable which negates the advantage of the right angle plug. What was Shure thinking?	-1
I am a new guitar owner so my evauatiion is not based on many different types of strings but it worked well for me. I broke the first string while attempting to tune it but it could have been as much my error as the string soooo go for it.	1
i've used many brand for my guitars for years. this one is very good, long lasting guitar strings. balanced tone as it says on the box and special coating system makes strings last longer than non-coated ones from lusting. easy to install and use, and very reasonable price. thanks amazon for this product sale.	1
Great great great great great great great great great.  Been uning them for years.  Love the sound and playability and durability.  matin coated are good too.	1
You want the best and easy feel strings on your acoustic..... Tried a 4-5 brands... Keep going back to Elixir.... They do last longer then any other brand so far... not saving that counts so much to me... easy play feel with full voice coming out..... Try them... You won't regret!!!!	1
these strings made my Taylor fun to play again! I didn't really like playing my acoustic after playing my electrics, so If you're struggling with your acoustic try these strings!	1
If you've ever used Elixirs, you won't be reading this.  They sound fantastic and last nearly forever.  I never buy anything else.	1

I have been using these strings a couple of years now.  They stay in tune well and last a long time.  An added bonus for me is they help a guitar with a slightly "tinny" sound on the high strings to mellow down a bit.	1
Whether you are a novice or a professional, these strings are the best choice.  They cost more up front, but last so much longer that they are cheaper in the long run.  I don't have to change strings as often and the sound is much richer.	1
I love the feel and sound of these strings and you don't have to change them as often.  I bought these strings for my new PRS SE Angelus.	1
I'm always worried that I'll screw up a pair of precision wire cutters when I re-string my guitar. Plus, I've got to go find some cutters and a winder as separate operations, as they're kept in two different places. Now, I can keep both in one tool with my guitar stuff and be done with it. Great gadget.	1
Great tool! The pin remover in the end is good for a 6 string but for a 12 string it could not lift the inner pins. But all else was as expected and hoped for.	1
This winder is great. On the positive side is the incredibly low price and the durability of this string winder. The only con I could think of is the size-it is slightly large, compared to another one that I own that is much sleaker in design, but it also costs twice as much. You decide. I have owned both and I would buy this one again in a heartbeat.	1
This is a great tool for all guitar players. The winder is great but what I really love about it is the string cutter. It slices of the excess string with ease. This tool has made my string changes a lot faster and neater. There's a version of this by Planet Waves with just the string winder but you might as well buy this, it also has a bridge pin puller.	1
Simplicity. I've never been a fan of acoustic-electric guitars.  Just don't care for the sound.  I'd prefer a real acoustic mic'd.  This does exactly what I wanted. My acoustic still sounds like my acoustic, crisp and clean. I don't have an acoustic amp but have no problem getting rich, sweet sounds from the clean channel of my Hot Rod Deluxe with an attenuator. But again, simplicity.  It's a pickup and a cable and jack. The cable is plenty long to just plug into your amp and you can tweak it there or you may consider plugging into a volume pedal or effects box. Almost nicked a star for lack of features but can't, this is what it is and it's a fantastic bargain considering the sound for the price.	1
This acoustic pickup is the most amazing thing ever. It has a very warm and soft tone and picks up notes very well. I couldn't be happier with the purchase. It's a very good investment if you play guitar but don't have an electric acoustic. I don't think I'll ever even buy an electric acoustic now since I have this thing. Prolly sounds better anyway!!	1
Have to turn amp up (100W) almost all the way to get any useable sound.  It works but not worth the money.  A mic would probably be better.	-1
The pickup itself is very nice and pretty easy to use but the plastic thing wrapped around the cable really annoyed me. How the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable? Anyway, the pickup sounds very nice and i'm happy.	1
Could not get to fit small sound hole. Once in sound hole pickup did not work at all. Would not buy it.	-1
as described--these are so consistent	1
Yup, I'm positive of it now. Been playing 13 years and I've been back and forth between these and Ernie Ball and I'm certain now that the D'Addarios are noticeably louder and brighter than their competitor, regardless of guage. Not to mention that each string has a color coded end to them, so you're far less likely to accidentally put the wrong string on the wrong saddle.  Don't get me wrong, I do prefer Ernie Balls' "worn in" feel; these are certainly brighter and more strident in feel, but in practice this only helps cut into the mix a little easier.  However, the most useful feature of all is that because they are LOUDER, I have a far easier time playing quieter, more intimate. It's the one or two key moments that you need every ounce of responsiveness and volume out of your guitar and these strings are the easiest, most efficient way to achieve that result.  Can't be beat for the price they're asking and they deliver in spades. Well done.	1
I have to use these now and they kill my fingers. I play Lead/rhythm/synth guitar and have for over 35 years. They used to make a .09 then they stopped????? I'm going to call and plead with them to bring them back. These sound great, just hurt after 2 plus hours on stage. But D'Addario's are the only ones that stay in tune. I've tried them all and always end up having to tune after each song. But then again I play the guitar! I don't fondle it like 3 note lead guitarists today.	1
Satisfied with these. Sound great. I really appreciated the colored ball-ends to identify the strings.  UPDATE: Downgraded my rating because the 3 unwound treble strings tarnished in specific spots within 2 weeks. The strings that I had on my guitar for ~5 weeks (prior to these) showed no signs of tarnish. Not sure why these degraded so quickly. They still sound fine however, and the lower wound strings appear fine.	1
Been playing 010s for past 5 years. No favorite brand...Fender, GHS Boomers, DR Pure Blues...all great strings. Took the dive to 011s seeking a fatter blues tone. Had my Fender Thinline Tele set up with these 011s (my guitar guy put these D'Addariios on because they're the only 011s he carries in the shop). Mind blowing difference in tone! Especially chords. Playing that mini triangle D7 shape on the A D and G strings for the IV and V chords during a 12 bar...the chord just explodes. So fat and full! Now, there is a downside playing 011s. Bends are a chore. You fight the notes and have to lean into them. 2 step bends are very difficult and literally painful...but I'm still getting used to these strings. The hand strength will come with time. My current tone is worth that pain. Great strings!	1
Great strings. I use these and never have a problem.	1
I've used D'Addario strings for many, many years without problems - both acoustic & electric.  I've tried these coated strings in the past, and I actually prefer them to Elixir because they feel more like regular strings - the wrap is coated, rather than a sheathe being placed over the entire string, like on Elixirs.  Do they last longer?  Probably.  Even when I'm in situations where I'm gigging regularly I rarely change strings more than every few months, just because I don't see the need.  I think the main benefit to coated strings is if you have guitars that you can't play regularly the strings won't corrode.  But these sound great and feel fine, and the're the least expensive coated strings I've found.  I've always found D'Addario quality to be great.	1
After playing for years with Elixir Nanoweb 80/20's, I decided to experiment with a few different coated strings. I tried the Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze, Dean Markley Alchemy Gold Phosphor (now discontinued) and these EXP16s. Ultimately, I preferred the Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze the best, but the EXP16 are cheaper and the difference didn't warrant the extra cost, so I decided to stick with these for now.  I wasn't a fan of the Alchemys because of their rough texture and high tension. The EXP16s are smooth and have a very playable tension, although not as smooth and easy as the Elixir 80/20's.  As far as longevity, these seem to last me about 2 months, which is on par with other coated strings I've tried, except for the Elixir 80/20's which average about 3 months. Uncoated strings last me about a month.  Depending on the style of play, I prefer brighter or warmer strings, but I'd rank the EXP16s somewhere in the middle. It's a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle. Even though they don't project as well as the Elixir 80/20s, they have a very agreeable tone without some of the harsh overtones. For live use with a pickup I'd be more inclined to use the Elixirs, but for unplugged or mic'ed use I like the tone of these.	1
When I first started playing coated strings, it was because Elixirs were on a new guitar I'd bought.  After trying several other brands and thicknesses, I ended up going back to what the factory had selected, and that gave me the sound I liked so well when I bought the instrument in the first place.  Then I bought another guitar from the same manufacturer, and it had EXPs on it.  Sure enough, better, more natural sound.  (I'd name the guitar maker, but this is about strings.)  Tried Cleartones on the instrument.  No thanks. Took 'em right back off again, (and not for the first time; no Cleartones for me, thanks.) The EXPs, though... Top notch!  Now maybe they'll make Custom Lights like Elixir does?  Having tried a LOT of strings over the past 40 years of playing,these are my favorite by far.	1
great deal	1
Works great! Great price! Works great with my guitars that have front inputs like my ES-335's!	1
love it	1
Guitar Cable for my Line 6 wireless. For my Roessel Experience Multivar and my Guild S300 Signature.	1
Excellent. Well done and high quality.	1
By far my favorite strings for my Taylor guitar.  The PB have a warmer tone which helps since Taylors have such a bright sound.	1
I bought this for my 1974 Martin D-18 for recording on my PC. So far it is working great. I have a Behringer 802 mixer already and I just plugged the guitar into that. It works perfectly. This guitar is very loud without a pickup, but to get the sound into my PC for recording I either needed to use a mike or a pickup. I chose the pickup. I got too much background noise with the mike.  Update: I started to get a loud buzz in my sound system and scratched my head a bit trying to figure it out. I had played my guitar about an hour before without that "buzz" being a problem. I discovered that if I turn the guitar a certain way the buzz went away. Then I remembered that the only thing I was doing differently was that I had turned on another overhead light since it was dark outside. I turned that light off and the buzz went away. My pickup was picking up interference from the new type florescent bulbs in the light. I'm glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup. ;)  After using the pickup for awhile I have noticed that the 5th and 6th strings aren't as loud as I would expect; also the 2nd string is louder than all of the strings. I'm not sure why. It's not a big deal.	1
Easy to install with a great sound. I have a very old Guild Acoustic Guitar and it was a snap to install and the sound was perfect. I like being able to remove it when not needed to amplify the sound. Can't go wrong with this one.	1
These strings are quite a bit more expensive than the D'addarios I normally buy, but they are worth the extra money. The sound from my guitar was noticeable more full and crisp. Several months after putting these strings on, they are still in good shape and sound very good. I feel like they can go another month or two before I replace them. Normally, I replace my strings every month or two due to sound degradation, tarnish, and stretching, but these bad boys have held their own. Try Elixirs once and you'll never go back.	1
Good sounding strings	1
The only strings I will use on my Riviera or Lucille guitars.	1
Retains sustain and brightness more than any other I've used.  I use the 11s for my strat tuned to Eb and the tension is perfect.	1
I play an old (1971) Gibson SG standard electric guitar. I tried the D'Addario 9.5 super light plus guitar strings about a year ago and am please to say with great results. I play classic Jazz tunes, viz: Misty, Autumn leaves, the girl from Ipanema, etc., etc. and found these strings perform very well. Also good for playing classic rock tunes, Hendrix, Santana, Frampton and may others. The strings give you better bending notes capability since they are a little thinner than 10's but thicker than 9's. However, depending on how often you play determines how long the string holds their clarity. I do play a lot so the strings last me about 2(two) months on average. I would recommend these strings to any devout players.	1
Never been disappointed with D'Addario strings. I have used them on 4 different guitars for years. Never had an issue with them.	1
good strings	1
Nice strings. Because they are extra light I had to adjust the neck but no big deal. They play easy and sound great.	1
have it for 2 years approx. after comparing the sound to Mogami, Sommer, Ki-Sound cables i discovered that it transfers more frequencies than the rest. Deep lows without cutting the highs (for slap and overtones). I keep good care of my gear, and it's durable enough, or even more than that. I don't like that it's so rigid, but that's a small price to pay.. didn't find a better bass cable yet, so I stick to them	1
It is one of the best products. It is an excellent brand. I use many of his products. IT WORKS VERY WELL	1
ive used monster cables for a very long time now and i like them for their great construction and the tones they deliver on my bass. i would never even think of plugging anything else into my bass	1
Just used the winder/cutter for the first time last night. This thing worked great! It was so nice to have an all-in-one tool for string changes. And the winder worked way better than the cheap ones you can buy for less. The cutter let me snip right down close to the tuner so the cut off ends would not ever stick out, scratch me or get in the way. Very easy to use. Highly recommend.	1
Some guitarist spend more money on strings than they do on food. Not to say that changing strings is a "daunting" task, but it's not something we really look forward to doing. The Planet Waves Pro Winder makes changing guitar strings not quite suck as bad as it use to.  It use to be you had your wire cutters and your hands, the hands were use to individually turn the tuners to pitch and the cutters to cut the excess string. The string winder cuts the amount of time to restring a guitar in half, or maybe even more. I had to change my strings without using the string winder and I started getting frustrated of how long it was taking. That experince showed me the value of this product is far more valuable to a guitarist than what they actually pay for it.  It's a must have and a great product to keep in your bag.	1
These cables work as described, improved clarity and response, less noise. I play a Fender Squier Pbass custom thru an Ibanez Soundwave amp, and the sound output improvement was amazing. Deeper, clearer, punchier. I bought 2 to run thru my foot pedals (use a quality cable between pedals, too!) so I didn't loose signal. For hobbyist practice or stage, these are the cables you want. Good price, amazing sound. Hey, they're from Monster! They know cables.	1
I was skeptical of getting this cable at first, I thought that a cable was a cable and it didn't really matter to much what you use. I was wrong. Upon opening the package, you can feel the quality of this cable, it is thicker, stronger, and better looking than any other bass cable I have seen. When I plugged it in, I immediately noticed that my bass sounded better. It sounder fuller, and more bassy. The cable doesn't change your tone, it makes whatever tone you use sound better. Even my tone deaf dad said that the cable "makes it sound a little better", I say it makes it sound a lot better. While it is a bit on the expensive side, it is worth the money. The life time warranty is definitely a positive aspect.  A final note, this is not the exact cable that I got. I needed the 21 foot cable. If you don't need that much cable, save some money and get the 12 footer. Get the combination of options that works for you. Whatever you choose though, this cable will not disappoint.	1
Good product	1
Great!	1
Great cable at a great price. Shure remains a consistently great manufacturer.	1
Works great!  My wife was able to hook up her electronic violin to  here shure body back transmitter without problems.	1
Works perfectly!  I have a Line 6 V75-BP body pack transmitter and I needed a new cable for it.  This one works perfectly, and is just the right length.  I usually have my pack mounted on my strap roughly in the middle of my back, and the cable easily reaches to my guitar or bass with just a little extra slack so im not pulling it out all the time like I did with the shorter cables.	1
It worked.	1
I have been using D'Addario Phosphor Bronze since they came out in 1974.  I use nothing else on my 2000 Gibson Advanced Jumbo. These coated strings don't keep the new sound any longer than uncoated EJ-16's.	1
These exact strings came factory-installed on my Takamine G260 acoustic guitar.  The polymer coating on the strings is so slight that I didn't even realize these were coated for a long time.  It doesn't really affect the sound, at least to my ears.  The coating helps protect the strings from corrosion, so it is a big plus.  I also tried the regular phosphor bronze and they are also good.  I suppose it's possible that these could slightly mellow the sound by damping ultra-high frequency harmonics, but the coating isn't supposed to be applied to the cracks between the windings, so I doubt it affects the sound at all.  If you like super-bright sounding strings, maybe you want regular non-coated, but these are probably the brightest coated strings available.  Sound great, have lasted months so far, 5 stars	1
These EXP16s sound better, in my opinion, than the Martins, Elixirs, and others I have tried. The EXP11s aren't quite as good (they are an 80/20 blend instead of the Phosphor Bronze used here. I have them on my Gibson J-100 Xtra, and I love them.	1
Good strings, though in 1 use I didn't notice any significant improvement over the standard Diaddario phosphor bronze strings.	1
I LOVE ELIXIR STRINGS THERE ARE EASY ON THE FINGERS HAVE GREAT SOUND AND LAST AT LEAST TWICE AS LONG THE PRICE THE TONE THE OF THESE STRINGS AER WELL WORTH THE MONEY	1
Love this brand. Beautiful sound, putting on new ones, always wonder why I waited so long to do it!  Have used Elixirs for 20 years, have been playing for 40, find these to be the best for me.	1
been playing for 40 years. these strings deliver clear sound, are easy on the fingers, long lasting. Wouldn't use anything else!	1
Try play with this strings ! The sound is awesome ! And never oxidate. Its a very nice strings for your guitar.	1
these are the best strings around.  last a long time especially if you live near the beach where corrosion is always a concern.	1
Sound great, last much longer than any other string I have tried. Worth the extra $$. Give them a try.	1
These strings have powerful boost in the high tones (compared to other strings) without sacrificing the low end.  Be advised that the wound strings (the four thickest) have a thing plastic coating on them.  Although this is what gives the strings their signature sound, after a few months of playing the plastic starts to rip off of the strings which kills the tone and looks ugly.  But the overall lifetime of the strings is longer than most other guitar strings. I would recommend!	1
Great set of strings. Cant go wrong with elixirs a little over priced but I am hoping to get long life out of them to make up for it.	1
Detuned 1 whole step and then dropped to C. Amazing response. Strings are bendable and flexible at that tuning. Not for the faint of heart if you're used to bending on 10's or 11's. These will make you muscle up!	1
Didn't last as long as other brands.	1
These are really good strings, at a really good price.  You get a 3 pack for what some companies charge for one set of strings.  And the expensive ones aren't even any better.  No one sells as many guitar strings as D'Addario.  Almost every guitar I ever bought came with D'Addario strings.  I've gotten Elixers, because I heard  many people praise them, and was totally unimpressed. They sounded dead to me.  Besides, I have a lot of guitars, and about 13 dollars a set would have cost me a fortune.	1
Gift that was accepted with smiles.	1
My guitar is a piece of garbage but these do a good job making it sound somewhat decent like all new strings do. I find they do a good job holding up over time and if they were to break, it'd be from tuning it way too high accidentally or after a very long time of playing. I've been really hard on these and that new feeling doesn't last super long when compared to a nano coated string but they sound great when you first put them on.	1
So much for so little.	1
Only strings I use.	1
It gets the job done. it pulls pegs, cuts strings, and winds strings on the tuner. great little tool to have!	1
It's made of strong plastic, doesn't bend or feel flimsy in the hand. Cuts bass strings with ease, winds strings easily. The end that covers the tuning key is very large, and perhaps on smaller, closer spaced, tuning keys may pose a problem. You'll just have to turn one key vertical and then wind the other one, and finish off tuning by hand (of course). I like that it's plastic, contrary to some other reviews, as it doesn't scratch or mar finishes unless someone should get stupid with it, and it's heavy enough plastic that you're not scared to use it. Good product. I'd buy another one without a doubt.	1
This tool does exactly what it is supposed to do and is a reasonably priced product.  As with any tool there is a small learning curve just to become familiar with the way it functions.  After using it a couple of times I can only give it high marks.	1
For about $8 you get a string winder, string cutter and an acoustic peg remover all-in-one. What more can you ask for?  Mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use. I have nice wire cutters, etc (I'm an EE) but it is much easier to grab one tool instead of two or three.  As for quality, it has an unconditional guarantee, see above. Planet Waves -aka D'Addario- is a well-known name in guitar accessories. To the reviewers complaining about the tool breaking, try using your warranty instead of whining. No manufacturer has a perfect run forever, but at least in this case you have not wasted your money.  For the record, I do not work for D'Addario / Planet Waves - but I would not dismiss a job off-hand if they offered it  ;-)	1
Works as a great replacement for the one I have with a straight plug on it. I needed an angle plug for a different bass.	1
The clip to plug into the transmitter is a bit weak (doesn't make solid connection), but haven't a problem with the cable otherwise.	1
Good quailty	1
Bought this to attach my new Shure GLXD1 body pack to a p-bass. Works perfectly, doesn't poke out of the front of the instrument. Note that the attachment is pushbutton release, unlike the screw attachment for the wire that came with the body pack. Also, the 1/4" jack is not as high quality as the original, but the price was right and it works.	1
Perfect replacement to the original cable I had.	1
I am really getting disappointed with these strings I never had a problem. My Hi E strings are breaking in the middle (between tuners and nut) not at a stress or contact point and (2) strings in the last week have come unraveled down at the bridge end, one on a ES335 the other on a Telecaster with a Babicz bridge, the string doesn't even have a turn in that bridge. I regularly bend a whole step not much more. I'm going to contact the company about this and I don't think these are imitations I have checked the bar code for that. none else having this issue? I had a B string break for no reason too.	-1
First experience with D'Addario strings. I'll never go back to Ernie Ball.	1
well packaged with a nice sound	1
Clean play and sound, nice lookin strings	1
Some of my strings weren't fully wrapped, which in turn ruins the playability ofba guitar. Nonetheless, I got what I paid for. Dissapointed in quality, however.	-1
Great.	1
Always liked D'Addario!!	1
I love this particular gauge. great for so many styles of music. Jazz, Metal, rock, blues, softer stuff, anything you name it!	1
i prefer a slightly heavier gauge, but these are ok for now...	1
You can't go wrong with ever putting on a new pair of Elixers, and the Phosphor Bronze coating does maintains that brightened tone that a set of new strings always gives. Always proud to have a spare pack lying around in my case in the event of any string breaking or when I need to replace my strings.	1
I have used them for years and won't switch. I have tried other coated  strings and was not happy. I don't like the poly web, just the nanoweb. They last much much longer thsan ordinary strings, the tone is great, and they are easier on the fingers.	1
Elixir Polywebs are not for most guitars, but in some cases they can help improve overly bright, harsh sounding guitars that need to be mellowed down a bit. Other than that I didn't like them at all on my guitars. So much for the Polywebs. However, the Nanoweb 80/20s are a whole different story. My all time favorite guitar strings are the Elixir 80/20 Nanowebs --it takes them a little while to break in, but once they do, they just get better and better... and they last a long, long time.	-1
I have been using these strings for years now and put them on all of my acoustic guitars. Custom light is perfect. The extra light version works well on 1/2 and 3/4 size guitars.	1
Elixir strings are great for me.  They hold their tones longer.  They aren't rough textured so they are easier on the fingers.	1
I've been using these strings for about eight years, and I also use them on my two Taylor's (814-CE & I use the mediums on my 710) I agree with the other reviewer in saying they are the best sounding coated string out there. I still use Martin strings once in awhile, but these strings last and improve in sound as they get a few hours of play on them.  Actually I own three other acoustics other than my two Taylor's and right now they're all strung with EXP's. I know people want different sounds from their strings, but I find these to be bright with a great bottom on them, unlike the Elixirs which I find to be unbearably bright with a weak bottom end. These strings sound great with great dynamics on them. Even on my Laguna Grand Symphony (slightly larger than a Grand Concert) they pump out the lows and sparkle on the highs. These on my Grand Auditorium do the same thing, they produce the sound I demand and make a real positive improvement over the other coated strings I've used.  The Mediums on my 710 have an endless bottom end and still have great range on the mid's and treble.  As I said I still use Martin Phosphor Bronze strings once in awhile, but honestly these strings hold up extremely well and sound great. Darn near as near to an uncoated string that you're going to find.	1
I use these strings on my Taylor 710 and they last a long time have a great bottom on them and still produce very good mid-range and treble. A set coated strings that doesn't sound like most coated strings do, but retains a very well balanced tone.  I feel that after playing mostly acoustic guitar for over forty years I can be reasonably objective on acoustic guitars and strings, and I always keep a few sets of these and the EXP lite gauge strings in my strings and tool box.  I also use the light EXP's on my Taylor 814-CE, Martin DC16GTE and Laguna LG6-RW . Again they just sound very natural and last a long time.  Over all the EXP's are crisp with great dynamics without the overly bright sound of the Elixirs which are just way too bright for me.	1
If you are looking for a great product that works good, for the right price, this is the one for you.  A great buy!	1
These are the only strings I will use for y guitar. It is true that they last longer, they feel better on the fingertips, and the sound is amazing. I would tell nayone to try these strings out because they do not disappoint by any means.	1
Original brightness lasts longer than most, then after that dulls a bit these strings settle in for a (still very lively and somewhat bright) mid-life that is also usually 3 to 4 times as long as any other strings I've ever used.  I actually spend less on strings with Elixirs than I would with non-coated strings as a result.  For now, this product has ended my years of searching restlessly for better strings.  It's a shame I don't get to buy the ones with cooler looking packages (e.g. Dean Markley) anymore, but that's just too bad.	1
Not as sturdy as some I've used and seen floating around, but it gets the job done as advertised.  Not a terrible buy.  Construction is a bit on the cheap side, though, as it is mostly plastic and seems a bit fragile around the edges.  The clipper and winder work well, though, even though they are both predominantly made of the same lower grade material.  However, all you really need are the two functions, and they work.	1
It beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet, but it could be better.  1. It slips off if you go too fast, but I thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this. 2. It didn't come with much of any instructions, so I was using it wrong at first. There is a big and a small slot. 3. The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use. The cutter works great, you just have to be careful. 4. The screw that holds it on keeps coming loose. Sure I can tighten it, but it just means the design could be better.  All and all it's one of those must have gadgets, but it does require a little discipline to master. I hope the next version comes with a soft, rubber insert so it doesn't scratch the chrome off my turner pegs. That and maybe they could use a long screw and some Loctite to keep it from coming loose. And well, maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find. Everything I have seems to be jet black.	1
Works as advertised. The winder fits perfectly for ibanez guitars and all other ones. The string cutter is nice so it doesnt damage your guitar like mishaps with a wire plier. Pin remover wears over time but lasted me 4 years and i still don't need to replace it yet. Makes tedious setups easy. A must have for all players who do their own setups.	1
Works great, love it!	1
I received my order and everything was as described.  I am pleased with my item.	1
Decent price and outstanding quality!	1

Great deal for the 10-pack. I usually have D'Addario as my third choice behind Ernie ball and DR, but this was too good of deal to pass up. Stringing them up I don't had to stretch the stings 2-3 times and now they stay in tune pretty good. Not sure what else you could ask for given the price.	1
Great strings,but you gotta look after them!!!	1
Love these strings and quick delivery	1
Sturdy,flexible design, works as expected, fast shipping, thanks!	1
A REAL bargain for those who maintain multiple guitars.	1
Best strings on the planet.	1
broke second day i had it.	-1
This is a great product that has been reccomended to me by many professional guitatist. They say you will not want to change stings without one after you get used to the (planet waves) string winder,cutter.	1
I bought one of these at my local music store and have found it to be a sturdy, easy to use string winder and pin puller. I read the negative Amazon reviews about cutter problems so have just continued my long practice of cutting strings using side cutters similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Grizzly-H6226-4-1-2-Diagonal-Side-Wire-Cutters/dp/B0002U8DGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Grizzly H6226 4-1/2" Diagonal Side Wire Cutters</a>. Looking at the cutter is does look like it could be the weak point on the tool.  Edited 9/2/13 to change from 4 stars to 5 and to mention that I have found the cutter to be very sufficient for nylon strings and metal wound nylon strings. Haven't tried it on steel strings since I still prefer my side cutters for them.	1
Most useful tool I've found. Grabs tuning pegs very well, doesn't slip off. Cuts everything from the low B on my 7 string to the high E with ease. No danger of cutting yourself. 3 tools in one for a very good price.	1
These strings actually save you money because you don't have to change em much. I keep em on a year or so and I play alot, out door indoor. constant abuse. they never rust. When they break I change em.   now..I'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change em..they really hold up. There are better sounding strings yes. But if your plugin in anyway, you can tweak the tone. The tone isn't bad, just not as good as a martin uncoated string. but if you like longevity and less squeak. these are great.	1
sounds great, and excelent durability, but I think it sounds higher than other brands. Myabe I will get used to it	1

Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound. They're easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound. Because they're coated and have anti-rust, they last up to months longer than regular strings and don't make much finger sounds. Favorite strings.	1
I have a Taylor 514 ce acoustic guitar and Elixir Strings are what this very nice guitar came with from Taylor when new.  I figure they have done the research on what works best and I see no reason for a change other than going fro the extra light strings to the light weight strings.  The sound you get with the Nanoweb strings are amazing and they enhance the results from an already great guitar.  They also last a long time before they go dead.	1
Excellent choice, really good product	1
Very popular gift..	1
Having just recently been made aware of Nashville Tuning or "high strung" guitar tuning, I started by grabbing a bunch of old, but unused strings of different manufacturers... just to try it out.  The end result was WAY less than acceptable.  So I sent for a set of acoustic and another of electric "Nashville Tuning" strings.  What a difference!  D'addario makes some of the best strings in the world, and this set-up is amazing when you have great strings.  [NOTE: If you're not familiar with Nashville Tuning... it's actually a string set where the top 4 strings are the same as the "octave" strings used on a 12 string guitar.  So, when you play, the whole character of the guitar is changed into something very similar to a mandolin sound.  Or, if you're recording, 1 track of a Nashvilled tuned guitar and another of a standard guitar will give you that 12 string sheen without the associated difficulty of playing 12 strings all at once.]  So, if you're looking for a different sound for your band, or just want to fool around with another guitar setup, Nashville tuning is a good place to start.  And strings by one of the premier string makers in the business makes this tuning sound wonderful!	1
D'Addario strings are, in my opinion, the best strings on the market today. They stay in tune and maintain their tone under a plethora of conditions that would, in my experience, leave other strings less than. I have tried ever string, ever gimmick (deep freeze) out there and always came back to D'Addario. What makes the 110Ws special or different is that the G or 3rd string is wound which I find easier to do pull-offs, especially multiple pull-offs. D'Addario are and have been the only strings I have used for years.	1
love these strings	1
nice	1
My favorite strings in the market. These last me longer than other brands.	1
Great price....favorite strings. Great tone!!!!!	1
great strings	1
I have used this for my weekend parties and I and friends have been impressed with it. It was inexpensive and puts out plenty of fog especially with the wired remote. I haven't had to keep filling it. I still have the fog juice it came with which is a very small bottle to get you started. It has lasted along time. I definitely recommend this one!	1
Too thick for drop D it is just in comfortable. Even in drop c they feel way too chunky.	-1
Excellent.	1
Go to strings these days	1
They're pretty great. They allow me to stay versatile and they have a decent life span. I'd recommend them.	1
I spent years trying out different guitar strings from different manufacturers and time after time I kept coming back to these. They stay in tune well, they stay fresh for a long time, they sound well in every guitar I've put them in, and they're competitively priced. I've played better sounding strings (that cost more), and I've played more comfortable strings (that cost *MUCH* more), but these fulfill all of the basic requirements I have for a guitar string, and I buy them bulk to put on all the guitars I set up and have not received a single complaint. Even from people who are used to playing 11s with a wrapped G. It's my personal opinion that 9s are only useful in situations where you don't want to bother setting up the action and intonation, and in every situation I've personally encountered, a guitar set up properly with good fret dressing, good action, and proper pickup height sounds best with 10s on it.  In comparison to boutique options like coated strings I think overall DR still wins in my book, but a quick spray of Fingerease on these does ALMOST just as well as long as you're willing to keep it up regularly. And they stay in tune, properly intoned, and bright sounding for MUCH longer than Elixir strings at half the price. I'm also a fan of the flat- and semi-flatwound strings that D'Addario makes for excessively bright guitars.	1
Put these on a relatively inexpensive Takamine, and REALLY like them in comparison to bronze strings. The tension is lower, it's easier to play, I like the tone better than bronze, and I think the saddle pickup sounds more clear with less piezo buzz, maybe because of the lower tension. Have a set of D'Addario Nickel Bronze waiting to go on next; if not for that, I'd order another batch of these.	1
I really meant to order 10's, but these sound good...	1
I keep oscillating between Elixir and D'Addario coated strings on my Taylor 714.  Truth is that I'm not fully satisfied with either.  I like very light gauge strings on all my guitars, but I prefer a slightly thicker G string because I detune and retune frequently, which eventually results in popping the G string. These are decent strings but they tend to be overpriced.	1
Only strings I ever buy. Great look and feel.  Almost like they're a part of my fingers. Brings more life to my Gibson Hummingbird.	1
I've written a review before. They are excellent. Never broke a string, but I only play at home as a hobby. therefore they not abused.	1
This is my second set of Elixir strings on this instrument.  Great sounds and feel,  Long lasting and stays tuned better than most strings.  Thank You	1
I started out my guitar hobby using these strings, they hurt like hell...that is until my finger tips went numb after about 3 weeks of constant playing.  Not a good string to learn with, but if you don't mind the pain, they are awsome and great quality, I was just the typical nub.	1
Works with my Line 6 Unit just fine..  I ordered two so I could always have a spare..	1
i love how quickly this winds up a string, and the cutter is sharp, but it would really benefit from a spring in the cutter.	1
I bought this mainly for the string cutter, although it has a peg winder and a bridge pin puller as well. At first I was skeptical because it's lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp. I was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings. I'm happy to say that it does an excellent job, much better than the pair of diagonal pliers I was using.  It cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly.  It's nice not having to carry the pliers around, which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock. As for the bridge pin puller, I tried it once but it is rather ineffective. I think it was included more as an afterthought as it's just a notched edge and can't really pull stuck pins. For pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge I would recommend the Dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive.  Overall I give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter. I'd recommend this to any acoustic guitarist as an essential tool to keep in their guitar case.	1
I wind long-scale bass strings onto my unusual super-short-scale 26"-scale, six-stringed bass instrument, so I'm betting I get more use out of this thing than about anybody. This device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much, much faster. The cutter worked great, too. Changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore. Can't ask for more than that.	1
I am a guitar string changing 'newbie' but these things make it so easy. I just bought these and watched a video on youtube about how to do it (sadly after I let my cousin try and he broke a string) and its so easy. I changed all the strings within about 20 min. This tool does everything you need. Plus its small so I carry it around with my little bag that has picks, a tuner, a metronome, extra strings etc. Good price, I would recommend it.	1
superb product  - i expected the winder to work well, however; i was delighted with the efficiency of both the string cutter and the bridge pin puller	1
The best choice when using an acoustic guitar. Sounds brilliant and sparkling. Life time seems to be alright when treated well.	1
These are my preferred strings, I would recommend to anyone with an acoustic guitar.  Unfortunatly they are a little pricey	1
I've been using Elixirs ever since Ben Clark (BanjoBen1 on youtube) recommended them in a video a couple years ago. I started out with the nanowebs, but eventually switched to polyweb because I preferred the warmer sound. Nanowebs are great too, don't get me wrong, but quite a bit brighter. The coating on these hasn't worn off as much as the nanowebs used to either, which I'm happy about. Playing for 1-3 hours every day, I can easily get 3 months out of one pack. Which is a lot for me, since I used to need new strings every month. I recommend Elixir's to every guitar player I meet, they don't make them any better than this!	1
A great deal on these!	1
I use these on my Epi Joe Pass. Love 'em.	1
Thank you!	1
Excellent product	1
I threw these on my PRS Baritone and they feel fantastic. I play primarily in Drop B. I play every day for at least an hour, and after 3 months, they started losing that "feel", you know? Tuning stability started getting wonky, and I had to change them. I'd totally buy another pack of these.	1
Happy purchase. Super light but stays in tune. Nice tone.	1
Great deal and fast shipping	1
Great deal and fast shipping	1
At the recommendation of a former guitar teacher, I installed the medium weight version of these strings on my Epiphone DR 500 MCE acoustic/electric guitar.  I tried for 6 weeks to become accustomed to those strings and they just weren't working.  Too much pain that produced no real gain!  Today, I installed these light weight strings and the guitar is again playable.  The sound level is probably 95% of the mediums.  The clarity seems better.  What impresses me is how quickly these tuned up and stayed in tune.  As always, Amazon handling of my order was prompt.	1
I bought these because they are the strings that came on my Taylor GS-Mini when I bought it.  I bought the guitar because it fit nicely in my left hand and because I really loved the sound of the guitar.  I don't like to fiddle with things too much so I'm sticking with the brand and gauge of strings that caught my ear in the first place	1
I've tried different brands like D'adario, GHS, Ernie Ball etc but the Elexir strings are the best. I used it a few times and they sound like new for 3 or more months. I recommend it 100%	1
The sound of these strings is beautiful. They feel durable and they keep tone for a long time. I love the .013 gauge. It gives me a little more resonation too.	1
Been using these strings since the 80's. Nothing else will do. Can't beat the savings on a 10 pack, when you have several guitars.	1
The best strings out there.  Great tone,  and great because the strings are individually wrapped in plastic.  So I can buy them in bulk, or even individually as they will last a lot longer in the box then more expensive strings that are sent out in open paper sleeves.	1
Nice strings	1
my fav	1
This set of strings solved a problem on both my Gibson and my Epi. They just work as advertised. Great bends on the top three, solid tuning that doesn't pull out on the lower three.	1
Again, the folks at D'Addario nail it. The best strings for most of my electric guitar needs.	1
great strings	1
I had a sure wireless system sitting at work (i teach music) doing nothing, so I purchased this so I could use my electric guitar when I teacher.  Works great, no complaints whatsoever.  **UPDATE 4/4/18**So I finally had to get another one as the first on was becoming sketchy.  The first one never really seemed to connect tightly to the transmitter so I tried taping it and it did not help.  It also started to cut in and out and I just decided to get a new one.  The new cable has a much better connection, though it looks identical in every way.  I honestly think it could be a bit more rugged in construction so I'm reducing my rating to 4 stars.	1
Awesome!  A MUCH better replacement for our Line 6 G50.  Love the right angle plug!  Shure quality!  Easily better than the cable that  came with the G50.	1
I have always wanted this type of system setup for my guitar.  I had the Shure  walk around mic system that you put on your shirt.  This connector plugs right into that sender and gives me the freedom I like to move around and play my guitar without being attached to my amp by a cord. Great connector.	1
Great quality product. Saves me time winding plus includes a string cutter which is awesome. Highly recommended	1
Finally, a winder that has features and durability designed into it.  The pocket of the winder head appears to be large enough to handle any tuning peg head size and the molded plastic body appears to be thick enough to stand up to a lot of use.  The pivot point doesn't bind when using the winder as has a couple other cheaper models I've purchased (and thrown away) over the years.  The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated, works well regardless of string composition type,...stainless, chromes, core-types, etc.  The price seems fair enough.  I've seen a couple of battery powered models for not much more money, but if you're in that big a hurry to change strings you're living life too fast...... get a 'roadie' to do it for you.... why have to remember to carry spare batteries.	1
This is just one of those handy inventions that after owning, I can't imagine NOT having it.  I love the Planet Waves Pro String Winder and Cutter that I bought one for each of my three guitars, just to be sure I was never without it.  The best part of the tool, in my opinion, is the blade/peg remover.  It is concealed when not being used (safety) and is super accurate when cutting.  Nothing is more frustrating than using needle-nose plyers on a headstock, being careful to cut excess without nicking wood or wound strings.  This tool eliminates the problem totally.  Also, the thin blade removes bridge pegs with ease and without damage.	1
Love Elixir strings! I bought my first pack, over 7 years ago and I've been hooked. They last, at least, twice as long as traditional copper wound strings, and sound even better. GET THESE! These make my cheap $50 acoustic guitar, sound almost as good as my Martin...no kidding.	1
I'm a fairly new player, on an Epi Les Paul. I know it's not a Gibson, but when I first got the guitar I quickly found that something sounded awful, and I tracked it down to the G string. A little research revealed the issue and led me to try this set with a wound G. It was a great improvement, for my ears anyway. Last time I changed strings, I found that I still had a set with a non-wound G so I put those on. Ow, my ears! The G always sounds to me like a plane flying over. (I've checked and adjusted the intonation and it's good.) I can't wait to get the 110W back on. My strings might not be the weakest link in my playing, but at least on this guitar these are the only way to go.	1
I love the hybrid sizes. easy bends up high, solid power chords down low. The best of both worlds.	1
exactly as advertised and a decent price	1
Good product.	1
Great guitar strings that last	1
GREAT	1
Thanks.	1
good strings	1
These are the only strings used by The Bicycling Guitarist on his Silver Anniversary Fender Stratocaster guitar.	1
I have these on my Les Paul. Great tone and seem to last a long time.	1
I liked the more mellow-sounding strings that came with my Takamine acoustic, but they sound good and haven't broken, yet.	1
I have played other strings these are just what I love. I play a lot and these last the longest as well.  Good price quickly delivered.	1
These coated strings eliminate the "squeeks" and provide sharp clear notes.  They have been on several months and still look brand new. Just be sure you wipe them down after you play.	1
Best strings ... Bar none... feel so good and sound great...  Tried all major brands... My Zager acoustic guitar is designed for light weight strings only ... when I use Martin ... sound tinning compares Elixir... they are more $$$... well worth it for the feel and sound....	1
Ok, this is the deal. Look at the nozzle in the photo. It has a mound shape and a single hole. The product that is shipped has multiple holes. It may not be a big deal for you but I ordered this to match my previous fog machine that blows the fog into a defined diameter tubing. The new nozzle not pictured but sent does not fit the tubing. Be advised.	-1
Ok so Im not sure what others are expecting out of a $25 fog machine...BUT, for what it IS. Its a good product.  First off...NO, its not going to fill half a gym with fog.  And NO, its not going to have a timer. Cmon..its UNDER 30 BUCKS!!!  Its a good machine for what it is.  If you take good care of it, it should last.  To give you an idea of how much fog it puts out.  I put a good amont of fog in my 2-car garage on just ONE blast.  After 2 or 3, the whole garage was filled.  Heres my take:  PROs:  Small, lightweight, inexpensive, decent quality built of good materials. 3-5 minute warm-up time, and same amount of time between fog blasts.  Fog blast lasts about a minute or so.  CONs: Small tank.  For those of you who broke it after the 1st or 2nd use.  A couple of fog machine basics:  #1 CLEAN IT AFTER EVERY USE!  Dump out whatever leftover fog juice you have, put some distilled water in there, and shoot it for a few minutes.  Then dump the water and store the machine.  #2 DONT RUN THE THING DRY!  Im thinking about buying another one and running one on each side of my DJ rig.  UPDATE:  I changed my rating to FIVE ***** Stars.  Why?  Because Ive used it a few times, and it is MORE than decent for what it is. Its REALLY GOOD for what it is!  I spent less than $30 bucks on this little machine and while its not pumping out sheets, or cloud billows of fog...it puts out more than what I expected from this machine!  I did a small (50-80 pax) DJ gig in a basketball gym, and NO...this machine DID NOT fill the place or even a quarter of the place. But what it DID do, was put enough fog in front of my lights to make it a little more dynamic up front. And thats all I expected it to do.  Did it meet my expectation?  YEP. And it exceeded it because I only filled it about 1/2 way, and that thing ran the entire gig (3-4 hours). The warm up time is around 5-7 minutes, and then it takes about the same amount of time, maybe just a little less: 3-5 minutes in between blasts, but its good.  I think the key here is CLEANING THE MACHINE AFTER EVERY USE.  Thats where people run into problems.  You cannot leave fog juice in this thing for an extended period of time. So I just run distilled water thru it after every single use.  And I decided NOT to buy a second machine. Instead, when I upgrade my lightng and buy a truss system, Ill spend the money and get a bigger machine.  Until then, this little puppy does a fine job.	1
I gave it a five star because it does what it was intended to do for a small to medium size dance floor. It definitely put out a lot of fog for its size. Built tough, small, and the fog juice last a long time. I would recommend this mini fogger for mobile DJs.	1
This thing work's great, the cutter is nice to have because then you don't have to carry any extra tool's with you in case a string breaks. Shipping was about a week, on time.	1
Whoever said that this thing was not worth buying is expecting way too much from a winder.  The handle is built solidly.  The cutter works flawlessly.  The "winding head" is made of plastic and could stand to be built a tad more sturdy but thats not a big deal.  The bridge pin puller is on the plastic head so that goes back to what I was talking about with the sturdier comment.  I used this to restring my Takamine and have no doubt that it will last for years to come!	1
I love the pin puller the most. The bottom of it is very thin so that it slides under the pin very easily. This was something that was not as easy to use on my $2.50 string winder.  The cutter was also fun to use. Snips very easily, but the grip is not that easy to maneuver. Still it is a very effective tool.  The string winder was also very good. My hands don't move in a perfect circular motion, and no where near it either, but this seems to help me achieve that fairly well, compared to my $2.50 string winder.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is planning on changing strings.	1
good	1
Us this on my Line 6 G50, and works great. Love the 90 on the connector into the guitar. Keep the original Line 6 cable as a backup.	1
Product quality is good .. is according to the price paid .. recommend this product is just what I needed	1
Amazing strings. They still sound new after a few weeks. My older strings that went flat after a month can't even compare. Highly recommended.	1
these are unique-sounding strings -- warmer in tone than phosphor bronze and for noobs i can say they are easier on the fingertips. I got them to try them out for practice, looking for something that lasts longer than Silk and Steel, which (for me) seem to go dead in about a week. They hold the tuning well after the usual break-in, which seemed to be shorter than others I have tried. They are not as brassy as bronze-wound, and seem to attenuate the ring faster. I play with banjo-style fingerpicks so a softer sound is sometimes desired, sometimes not. For performers, i would suggest putting these on an instrument dedicated to the sound.  Physically, the strings are beige in color and appear to be wrapped in some type of polymer; remains to be seen how well they wear with time. have not tried using a slide with them yet, and wonder how they would do. These are on a Tacoma D-9, which is a full-bodied parlor dreadnought.	1
For those who are not sure about Elixers: Next time you change strings, put one wound string from a non Elixer set along with 5 Elixers and within ten days or so that one string will sound dead compared to the others. Other strings might sound better to you for the first day or so, but it's the long term benefit that I love.  I play more than most folks and yet only need to change strings about two to three times a year.  I've only had one break in the last ten years. I've tried other coated strings but these are much better.	1
These are my favorite acoustic strings.  I really like the tone that they give, and it is valuable that they do not need to be changed out as often as most other strings.  They hold a tuning well.  I use these in my Taylor GS8, and I love the tone and volume of sound that they provide.  There are many fine guitar strings, of course, but I think that these are the gold standard to measure others by.	1

I have been using Elixir strings for years on several guitars. They came as standard equipment on my GS Mini. I'm just a knock about player that enjoys the sound of the guitar. The nice thing about these strings is even though cost more in the front end they last twice as long a other strings.	1
This are amazing stings, lovely the bendings. My Gibson loves it.	1
They work great on my Les Paul. They give excellent string bending control.	1
Been using these for close to 30 years now. Best strings for what I do.	1
Sweet round tone. great strings.	1
Yup.  Strings!	1
Long lasting strings!	1
Love these, as good as strings costing 2x more!	1
specs say my ephiphone les paul comes with these, and I was happy with it out of the box so figured i'd put the same on when mine started sounding dull... so far so good	1
I've always been an old school guy when it came to strings. When coating came out I stuck to my D'Addario guns. On lower end guitars, it really doesn't matter. But after switching OFF of these Elixirs on my Taylor 816, I could hear and feel the difference. These are tight, bright, and keep the playability for weeks and weeks. It's going to have to be these for me from now on.	1
Not as vibrant as non-coated D'Addario Phosphor Bronze I usually use but still good.  Too soon to tell if the coating will retain tone and are worth the extra cost.  Others swear by them.  My first try.  We'll see.	1
Time will tell if they last longer than strings 1/3rd the price. Visually, they don't appear any different than cheaper Bronze wound strings. I was expecting something different, but as far as sound goes, the strings tuned well and only required some stretching 3 times to get them to stay in tune, even after playing "smear notes" on several songs. My problem with cheaper strings (De'Angelo) was they would tarnish or rust quickly, the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar. The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer. I'll know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not. Since these are literally triple the cost, I'll know if it was worth the extra expense. Hopefully these are made in the USA instead of China like most other things we buy in America. Good or bad, once I see the longevity of this set, I'll add to this review at that time.	1
These strings have are great with my guitar. I have used these strings for 3 months now and have noticed no change in their integrity.	1
5 stars, arrived on time and in good condition. Price is excellent. Will install to one of my acoustical guitars within the next few day.	1
makes my taylor sound alive realy like them great feel on the fingers great sounds and tones will buy more	1
I use these in conjunction with a 74 gauge for a Jackson 7 string.  Singing leads and articulated beefy riffs.  Although like most guitar strings they don't last very long slap these on before a show and get ready for the tonez!	1
Try them.....you'll love them!	1
Very nice set of 8.5's for those times you want to play with less tension than 9.	1
Perfect	1
The best	1
great strings at a good price point	1
Excellent!	1
What can I say, I love a good deal and these strings sound good, seem durable, and the 3-pack is a much better deal than buying one set at a time.	1
Ive been using DAddario EXL 110 nickel 10 gauge on my low action Gibson Angus Young SG.  I have short thin fingers (2  long pinky) with a heavy touch on both fretting and picking.  I had buzz with some low fret bar chords, and reaching with my pinky, so decided to try these 9.5 gauge.  They are easier to play, and do help eliminate the buzz, especially when reaching with my pinky.  They sound about the same as the 10s.  I did have to loosen the truss rod 3/16 turn to eliminate buzz on the low E string.	1
They key fact in evaluating this fogger is the price: for $40, you can't expect too much, but this unit still does a good job. I've used it for several small-venue parties (house celebrations, weddings, etc) and have gotten pretty good results. Once you let the machine warm up (many don't realize this, but yes, you have to wait for the machine to warm up) the fog does come out in large doses, and then sporadically throughout the evening as well. I personally found the included fog juice to smell really nasty, so I bought my own fog juice solution.  It doesn't fill up a very big venue, but for $40, I find the value to be quite worth it. Best of all, the unit doesn't require too much power, so I can hook it up with other lights and effects rigs. The included foot pedal comes in handy.  Hope this helps!	1
This little guy is pretty awesome. I needed a small fogger for a room no bigger than a large classroom and this works like a charm. Make sure for any fogger you buy that you take care of it properly. Running distilled water through the fogger after use isn't a bad idea.	1
This is an excellent fog machine for a house party and brings out the best of my lasers, vertigo lights, and scanners.  However, the included juice fog doesn't last long enough so I had to fog again as soon as the machine is ready.  I ended up just taping over the button for continuous fog all night.  The included remote just creates potential hazard in the dark, so I pulled that off.  Also, the outer shell gets HOT so had to put this behind the DJ booth to prevent anyone from burning themselves.  Lastly, keep the fog furthest away from any air return vents.  This is to prevent your juice money getting sucked into the vent in a hurry.	1
The choice of guitar strings is kind of personal.  I like the Elixir's because they sound great, feel great,  and they last long.  I put these on my Taylor CE635.	1
I only play Elixir strings.  They are relatively finger friendly, hold their tune well and are much longer lasting than many strings I have played in the past.  These were for an electric acoustic I just bought, which is why I got a lighter string than I normally play.  I will move to mediums once I get the feel of the guitar.  Of course, they will be Elixirs as well.	1
I find these a great value for they last at least 3 times longer than uncoated strings. they age well, and do not lose tone all at once.	1
At the recommendation of my former guitar teacher, I bought these medium gauge Elixirs for my Epiphone DR-500 MCE acoustic/electric guitar.  While they do produce more sound as an acoustic instrument (a good, pleasing sound), I apparently lack the strength to play medium gauge strings.  I did verify that the truss rod has the guitar neck straight.  After 1 week and at least 15 hours of play, I can not cut it with these strings.  Another friend, professional guitar player and luthier had recommended against the medium gauge strings but did I listen?  Going back to light weight Elixirs.  Through my amplifier, light or medium gauge strings make only a slight difference.  For whatever it's worth...	-1
My old cable was noisy. Every time it was touched or handled it was heard as clearly through the amp as the guitar was. This cable adds noticeable punch and clarity, as well as added volume in my opinion. There is absolutely NO handling noise while moving about with them. They are heavy duty, and should last for years to come. If you play bass, you owe it to yourself to have a set of these cables, if you play regular guitar, get the ones suited for that. These are dedicated bass cables, frequency ranges and responses are fine tuned for low-end. Though they would probably work fine for other guitars/uses, get the cable specified for those applications. This could be the last bass cable you ever need to buy if you take care of it.	1
I was skeptical of getting this cable at first, I thought that a cable was a cable and it didn't really matter to much what you use. I was wrong. Upon opening the package, you can feel the quality of this cable, it is thicker, stronger, and better looking than any other bass cable I have seen. When I plugged it in, I immediately noticed that my bass sounded better. It sounder fuller, and more bassy. The cable doesn't change your tone, it makes whatever tone you use sound better. Even my tone deaf dad said that the cable "makes it sound a little better", I say it makes it sound a lot better. While it is a bit on the expensive side, it is worth the money. The life time warranty is definitely a positive aspect.  One final note, this is not the exact cable I got. I got the 21 foot, one angled one bent cable. If you need the two straight ends, get them. But whatever combination of cable options you choose, this great cable will not disappoint.	1
Great strings. Lasts a long time. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wishes to purchase quality and lasting strings.	1
I am a novice guitar player (playing for 3 years now).  I change my strings about twice a year and have tried several brands, but I love these the most!  The sound is excellent on my guitar (nice deep sound).  After the initial stretch, they hold their tune very well (my pins on my guitar are also tight).	1
A bit expensive, but the sound is exquisite and the strings last a lot longer than others.  You get what you pay for.	1
Once again , Elixir strings true to its advertizement  just plain hard to beat . Sound is fantastic and longivity is great.	1
You cant go wrong with Elixir strings . These strings will briten up the sound of your guitar and last alot longer than others. Try them out , I think you will be amaized with the quality . Thumbs up.	1
Elixir's sound Amazing. I generally use a $5 d'addario acoustic string or an Earthwood but the difference in comfort and sound is Great. I play with comfort and ease for hours at times. The life of these strings is probably three times as much as any string I've used. Highly recommend to anyone new to guitar strings or just someone who hasn't put up a few extra bucks for them. Great strings.	1

What's not to like. New Strings sound great, last and last all day and all night long. Do not have to change out strings as often	1
Good strings	1
I can't even count how many years I've been using these strings. They sound perfect on both my Les Paul and my Strat, and if you wipe them down (do the finger nail grip with a microfiber cloth) they last a long time. Highly recommended.	1
Perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
I use these strings on all four (4) of my electric guitar's. They are good strings, and good quality.. I once had an issue with a single string that was nicked, and it failed to tune.. I emailed the company, and they made it right, no questions asked.. These are great strings..	1
first time trying these type of strings and they fit perfectly and sounded great.  Would Recommend	1
Been using D'Addario 9-42 since the early 90's.  Changes in guitars and playing style have pushed me to 10-46.  I love these strings as they are very consistent - not super bright when they are new and then change over time.  Once you stretch these out they have the same tonal character for a long time.  Plus they're pretty cheap so you can replace them whenever you want.	1
No problems! A++	1
great strings, last a long time and sound just as i expected	1
I love these strings. I buy them for my Taylor 414ce and they sound beautiful every time. I don't see myself buying any other kind of string in the near future	1
These strings hold a wonderful tone and last for months!  I have added to all of my guitars and find I tune less than ever.	1
awesome	1
bright tone use on a les paul and strat	1
Vere nice and good	1
Love these strings!	1
Great Product! Great Price!	1
More perfect strings. Great for a seasoned guitar and equally great for a brand new guitar. Thank you.	1
I'm not a great player but I really like these strings on my Fender Strat, and Epiphone Riviera.  Very smooth and playable.  Inexpensive but great strings.	1
I only use Elixr polyweb strings for my performance guitars. I always try to buy when they are under $13. In the stores they are $16. They last me a few months before they start loosing tone and  durability.	1
I have been using these strings for 7 years.  At first I used the Elixir Polywebs, but those things broke all the time.  I switched to these and haven't broke a string since.  If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string, but these match well with my 414ce Taylor.  Because of the price I don't use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic, for that I suggest Earthwoods.  I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat, very pleased there as well.	1
Always buy D'Addario.... Always!	1
As advertised	1
Really good strings. The lows are nice and chunky and the highs are bright and crisp. They stayed in tune surprisingly well.	1
I've been using EXL140s for years. Great strings, and the 10-pack is quite a bargain!	1
Great deal, great strings!	1
You already know these strings are great.  The value is even better.  And they are delivered in 2 day?  No brainer.	1
These are expensive, they seem to last longer, but when they start to wear, they develop a 'fuzz' where - I assume - the nanoweb is wearing off.  It doesn't seem to affect the playability.	1
These are great strings. Lots of bright tone, sustain and long lasting. They are just what a working musician needs!	1
These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb. Still a great guitar string. A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of "Goretex" A real triumph of re-invention. Well done Goretex!	1
These are perfect. Hard to beat strings. They last, keep in tune, and keep their tone. They don't need any string cleaners either. So you can save money on that. An obvious noticeable difference between the Medium gauge and the Light is that these Medium gauge are not recommended if you like to finger-pick a lot.  But boy.... Are they bright! Enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees!	1
Punchy, accurate  and rich in character.  These. Strings make all the difference in the world , elixirs yield true sonic goodness	1
Good quality. It was a great price for it. A + + + + + + + + + +	1
Good quality. It was a great price for it. A + + + + + + + + + +	1
Best brand good quality	1
Great price. Great strings. Been using them for over 35 years.	1
good product	1
Perfect fit for my ESP Baritone Viper. I tune down to B and some times A and the notes still cut through with clarity. So I'm satisfied. I'm sure these will be the go to strings for that guitar for now on.	1
I've been using D' Addario strings for a few years now and they're simply the best performers at least for me. They keep their brightness longer than any I've ever used and in 4 years I only broke one string (and that was my fault), I use standard 10's on my Hamer Studio and I use the skinny top / heavy bottom hybrids on my Les Paul. Wouldn't change them for anything else. If you've never tried them you should grab a set and give them a go. you'll be glad you did. Oh yeah one more thing, the prices for these here on Amazon are the best. I can't come close when buying locally. I'm talking a HUGE difference.	1
Great string. When I first started playing guitar, I chose Ernie Ball (because that seems to be the most well-known brand). Those strings always seemed to break after a while, though, and so eventually I moved on to trying new string brands. After I tried D'Addario, I really haven't used any other brands. They are color coded at the bottom to easily differentiate which string is which and the strings always sound great after they're broken in. They always seem to last forever, and I only really get a broken string after many, many months. Some of my guitars have had the same set of D'Addario strings for a few years and haven't broken yet. Overall these are great strings. I always use .10's, but I have used the .09's before and they have the same quality as well. I would definitely recommend this brand of strings, and I would also advise any potential buyers to spend the extra money for a 3-pack. Even though these strings are the best quality I've ever used, they will still break from time to time. That's just how strings are. So save yourself some time and money and get the 3-pack (unless you're still testing out different string gauges, in which case a 3-pack might be a waste of money).	1
Theyre meant for down tuning, and do it well. Low end can get fairly djenty.	1
Best strings for me. Won't go back to Ernie Balls.	1
I tune to C so these are what I like. Plus still have give for solo bends on the top strings.	1
These are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are. They are so tuneful, they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful. My only concern is that if the strings aren't wound properly they seem brittle and break. e.g. Low E and A strings and the vulnerable G string. The LIGHT version I find, are particularly suited to finger picking.	1
I've been using Elixir strings since Gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago. I use both electric and acoustic. The product performs exactly as they guarantee it will.  Every once in a while I'll get a "dead" string. I'll just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge. Same thing with strings that break while tuning them up.	1
I love Elixer strings - just great sound and they last a long time. Hard to beat these. I don't hear or feel much difference between the Phosphor Bronze and the other type but I'm sure there is one - you probably need two guitars of the same make/model strung up with the two types to really figure out which one you prefer.	1
Works as expected, awesome	1
Consistently good.	1
thank you	1
Worked real well on my hybrid guitar	1
Put these on a Gibson that originally came with 11's but was hard for me to play so I went to 10's. I was never really satisfied with the sound quality because it's a semi-hollow body. I recently got a Gretsch that had these strings. It seemed effortless to play on that guitar so I thought I'd try them on the Gibson. I also realized that if you press down hard on your fretboard like I tend to do, thicker strings may make it easier for you to play. It's hard to explain but it works for me. Anyway, D'Addario probably makes half of the strings out there, so you might as well just go to the source if you want great quality strings at a great price.	1
Makes playing a 12 string very enjoyable. Great tone.	1
I will buy these over and over.. awesome strings and its so nice you can pull out a whole set or just one.  The strings are separated by boxes inside.  If you run out you can just buy what you need.  Best deal I had all year.  And of coarse great price and fast shipping with Amazon Prime.	1
Ok	1
I have used this product for many years to grease the corks on my saxophones and clarinet.  It works much better than any of the normal cork grease products you can purchase, as it does a better job of soaking into the cork to keep it moisturized.  It only takes a couple of dabs of this on the cork...then simply rotate your mouthpiece around as you slide it on the neck to spread it to the entire cork surface.  I thought this product was no longer available...until I saw this today!  Whew...I'm back in business!  Highly recommended product...based on more than 30 years of using it in the "real world"!  :-)	1
I purchased this product to lubricate the tuning slides on my trumpet and flugelhorn.  I haven't used this particular Selmer product for years.  The company must have changed the formula because clean up is much more of a chore than I remember.  The tuning slides move easily, but it was very difficult and took a lot of work to remove the excess grease from the finish of the horns.  Can't say I'll use it again.	-1
These strings last much longer than regular strings. Under my playing conditions, that means about 6 weeks rather than 2. In my experience, the phosphor bronze last longer than the regular bronze and have a cleaner sound.	1
I play a rd 26 recording king, used to play martin strings. Changed to these and the tone mellowed and volume increased. Also, they last longer and do not screech as loud when sliding.	1
They are very bright. Really surprising difference. I've only had them for a week or so, we'll see how they hold up.	1
Great rockin sound.	1
great	1
Loving the new strings just bought them on a chance they would be the action I was looking for. Not to bad...	1
These have been my go-to strings for over twenty years. You can't beat 'em. They're smack-dab in the middle of all the other strings in terms of quality, sound, and cost-effectivity. For what I do they work well and always have.	1
Very bright sound	1
This is a full set of premium guitar strings. According to the box, the strings have a special coating that prevents contamination and corrosion from collecting in the windings of the strings, and this is supposed to make the strings last 3 to 5 times longer. Interesting claim. Of course, the highest 2 strings, B and E are bare, not wound, so I don't know if they have the special coating. It seems most people find the B and high E strings more likely to break than wear from corrosion, and I don't know if these Elixir strings are any less likely to break than others. But in any case, if you find your strings wearing quickly because of corrosion, the premium price of these strings may be worth it for you. The tone of these strings is pleasantly bright and comparable to other quality guitar strings.	1
I've been a pro guitarist and teacher since the 1980s. I also once worked at a large guitar shop where I had access to many choices for stringing my own instruments.  I love the sound of these strings on my Taylor 710ce, and also on my 'beater' (Larrivee D-03).These are about 3x the price of most other (conventionally wound) strings, but they do last about 4x as long (unless you break them), as the package accurately claims. So, for me, this is a no-brainer!	1
I used to use the Elixier nanoweb, but the nano part would peel off the strings like dried glue from the palms of your hands. The polyweb doesn't have this problem. Some people complain that the coating dulls the sound of the strings, but I really like the tone. I have used these for years, and in fact, they're the only strings I like at all anymore.	1
The Nanoweb formulation has been a companion of mine for years. Though they cost more than other strings, I change them less often. Also, they sound good at the outset and they don't change very much over their life on the guitar.  Most other strings (O,K, all others that I have used) have a distinct change of character in the first days to weeks of playing: usually from very bright to very dull in a relatively short time.  Elixir Nanowebs give you a consistency of tone that lasts for months.  They don't break easily. They are quieter while changing positions.  The coating will, after quite a while, start to fray.  Not a big deal, as that indicates it is probably time for a change anyway, and it takes a very long time for it to happen.	1
I really like these strings. Have used this make and size on my two Taylor guitars for years. Will continue to do so.	1
Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings.....to the less and also most expensive strings.  I find the Elixir excellent. My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet. That may change along the way. However, I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine.  What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate.  Therefore, strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear. My ears remain attentive to future string sounds.  I also love the d'Addario make.  Which I purchase through Amazon...always.	1
I've enjoyed these strings and make sure I have a extra pair on hand. Will be recording soon so need to think of possibly getting some for my buddy too.	1
I've played guitar for 40 years.  I've used these since they first came out, tried to go back to others, but kept coming back to these.  I used to have to change strings every 1 to 2 weeks.  Now I can go a year without a string change.  Had them on one of my guitars for 2 years and they still sounded good and stayed in tune.  Until someone convinces me otherwise, I'll keep using the Elixir Nanowebs on my guitars.	1
I have used many different brands of strings over the years, but have been sold on Elixir for the past 5.  Great sound and string life.  Must have.	1
I love the Elixir strings. They sound great and play easy. I would recommend them to anyone. Give them a try..	1
$3.00 a pack x 10 = greatest deal around!	1
I strictly play for fun, so I really don't like spending much money on strings.  I've used several different types of strings and never really had any complaints necessarily, but when I saw the price of these I decided to give them a try especially since they were cheaper than anything I find in a store.  I don't think I will ever use any other strings though cause these are great.  By far the best strings that I've used anyway.	1
Great strings, very smooth with minimal noise sliding up and down the fretboard.	1
the longer these strings are played the better they sound. They needed a little break in time	1
love the sound	1
Great strings.	1
I switched to these for all my electrics (I have about 20 and play 4-6 regularly). The . 009 - .046 gauge makes playing, bending a bit smoother, and they last really well (I wipe on FastFret to lube the strings and stop corrosion). They do what . 010 - .046 strings do, but seem to play a bit easier. A lighter feel makes playing better as it frees you to play and not be concerned with  too much string tension.	1
I've had these on my Yamaha APX500 for a while now and they sound really good.  A tad brighter than I like, but that's just the nature of the lightness of the strings.  It's real smooth when playing and they seem to be lasting longer than most strings I try.  In fact, I've had these strings on for over 4 months now and they still feel and sound good.	1
These are pricey but keep the fresh sparkly tone much longer.  When they start sounding a little dull it wipe them down with Fast Fret, loosen off the tension a bit and wipe 'em down firmly and they sound new again.	1
Elixer strings are the best strings. They feel great sound great and last forever. I would highly recommend them! 5 stars!	1
All I can say is,,, You should try a set of these Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings for yourself. You will not want to go back to any other set of strings. I've been using Elixir strings for many years. They have better feel, sound, and last longer than all other brands I've used playing Guitar. Elixir has excellent quality control too. I've never had a problem.	1
These strings are a little more money than the average strings, but they last longer. Great for the dedicated guitar player.	1
These strings are like magic. A littler more pricey than your martins or d'adarrio or most others, but whoo boy you get what you pay for.    If you have an older guitar and want it to sound new, or even a newer guitar and want it to reach its full potential, slap these babies on. You will be blown away at how much of a difference they make. Tone is rich and full (even on cheaper guitars), and they even feel nice.    I can't recommend them highly enough. They last for 6-8 months sounding great, maybe longer if you don't play every day. Worth your money.	1
These play really well. I have tried many other strings and I like these the best of any. Very easy on the fingers and great sound. Worth the extra $.	1
Someone bought me a gift card and this is one of the things I got. I also got some 12 strings and a tuner. Nice...	1
Elixir Strings give a good tone and last longer than any other stings I've bought.  Whether I'm playing Rock or Country these strings give me the tone I need. Shipping was super fast as I used the regular shipping so I got them a couple days before I expected.	1
Pretty decent strings for the price. I'm not brand loyal at this time, so I am trying several brands to see what I like. And some guitars like certain brands better. They are smooth playing and I can play for at least an hour and not feel like my fingers have been through a grinder.	1
Got a Gibson EDS-175 with the set back tailpieces and these strings are long enough to reach the top tuners.	1
Rock on	1
These are my go to strings.	1
Installed......10 times better.....10 times more played!	1
These strings lasted much longer than any other string I have tried, with very little sound quality loss.  I was very pleased with the quality and price of this product	1
Excellent strings. Great sound, longevity and price.	1
Arrived on time and as described.	1
Love the feel on these strings	1
I replaced my Elixer strings with DR's hoping to get a better sound.  Sound is subjective but they sound different and sonically more pleasing to me. A lot of reviewers agree!	1
I was very pleased with the item as it arrived on time and was exactly what I was expecting for what I had ordered!!!!!	1
The Elixir brand acoustic guitar strings keep their brand-new 'sound' a lot longer than any other brand.  I am very happy with the Elixir brand strings.	1
These guitar strings ring! They are very bright, and do sound very good on a mahogany guitar. I also played these in a local music store on a different guitar and they still sounded beautiful. I have had them on my guitar for 5 months and they still sound good, so they last pretty long. Definitely worth the price.	1
I have written other reviews about elixir. High quality strings. Great for acoustic and electric. No complaints on these strings.	1
Perfect gauge for Les Paul if you want to do any moderate drop-tuning.  In other words, the perfect GnR strings :)	1
On a 25.5in scale tuned to drop A#, these are a GREAT standard off the shelf pack. My only replacements are a 62>60 and 26>20 and that's merely preference, the set is super solid as is.	1
Love the feel so far and they sound great.	1
Great strings!	1
Perfect!	1
Are you a gigging musician?  Why the heck would you buy one pack at a time? What? Are you going to stop playing tomorrow or something?	1
Great strings	1
Great strings from a good company. The coating on the strings is obvious quality, and after just a few days of playing I can see that these will last a very long time. They also have a nice sound compared to other companies.	1
I have been using these strings since the mid 1990's. Once you use them, you will never look at another. They don't corrode as quickly as others and allow for smooth playing with the strings coated. I endorse few things. This is one of them.	1
I don't care that the D'Addario strings come in a 3-set pack for the same, if not less, price. These strings will beat them everyday. The nanoweb coated strings are my #1 fave as of about two years ago. I haven't tried the polyweb, but maybe I will in the future. All I know is that these strings are extremely bright sounding, and put out a full, round sound. Very majestic. Will come back again and again to the Elixir brand.	1
One reason that I like these strings is that they last a long time. I have several instruments and I don't want to spend time replacing strings on all of them. So the ones that have Elixirs don't require frequent changes, and to my ear, I don't hear any difference from other non-coated phosphor bronze strings. I've also used Elixirs on my bass, and they've lasted well over a year.	1
This is all subjective of course, but these are my favorite strings to play on.  The coatingwill wear off evantually with regular use, but not exceedingly fast.  They keep a good tone quality for sure.  The coating keeps then from corroding / rusting from the saltsin your hands.  I'll keep buying them so long as they don't change.	1
I am new to the guitar and was given an older silvertone guitar with apparently the original strings on it.  A friend suggested I try using Extra Light gauge strings as it would be easier on my fingers.  He was definitely right.  They were easy to install and much more pleasant than the original strings.  I cannot compare these to any other brand since this is my first experience with new guitar strings but they do seem to hold up well to an amateur after 3 weeks of usage.	1
these actually lasted a really long time on my acoustic. In fact they've been on there a year. On a normal phos bronze set Id get about a month before they looked liek a copper penny from the 1970's.	1
Really Great Product, soildly built, More than happy with perfomance, and I would ecomend this product to everyone who has a need....Its all Good!	1
The only place I found them a bit cheaper was Just strings. Elixir's stay alive until you break them relatively speaking. Great strings.	1
Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze, Martins Lifespan SP, Dr, D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze, and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all, smooth on my fingers. Second, Elixir Phospher bronze, last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better.	1
These strings are my second choice after the Elixir 80/20 Bronze. They are warmer sounding, well balanced. Cost a lot but well worth it to me.	1
WAY better than stock strings that I received with my Fender acoustic.  I am a beginner guitar player, but I was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers.	1
I am a beginner guitar player, so I don't have too much experience with different types of strings.  But, I can say that when compared to the stock strings of my Fender Acoustic guitar, these things are like night and day.  A much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers. Highly recommended.	1
strings were great. just a little to light for me. gave them to a friend who was just starting out	1
Great strings.	1
I don't have experience with a lot of different strings, but I use these on my LP-style electric guitar and I like them a lot.	1
Again...OUTSTANDING !! Just incredible strings.	1
Outstanding .......!!!!!!	1
My go-to strings.	1
These are my strings of choice, and I've been using them exclusively for years.  Perfect gauge for my aggressive picking style on the low strings (I play mostly rock and metal).  Reasonably priced when compared with the likes of NYXL or coated strings.  Spectacular tones when the strings are brand new, but they typically lose their "zing" within a week or two.  I've had them on a guitar for as long as 6 months straight and never had a string break on me.	1
good sound - change those strings - you will  be glad you did	1
Love'em Love'em	1
Great strings these are all I use on all of my guitars.d'addario has always made good quality strings and I will continue to use them as long as they name them,	1
Using these on all of my electric guitas, but im going to have to change them due to the high humidity where i live. after a few weeks the strings tend to look rusted, but thats not the strings fault, its the high humidity where i live. So if any one lives in a similar environment, you probably want to go another route (coated).	1
Be warned: using these will turn you into a rockstar	1
great strings	1
Definitely have to have a proper set up if you use these.	1
New favorite for Eb tubing, I don't like 11's and 10's always feel like there's a little chunk missing in the low end. This gauge rocks! Excellent playability and great tone and harmonics in Eb tuning. I wish more companies made this gauge...	1
Easier on the fingers for a beginner than the steel strings.  These strings also made the guitar have a more mellow sound and not as much "twang".  Maybe its just me.	1
Good Strings. I personally prefer Ernie Ball Earth wood guitar strings. To each their own. Its a very subjective thing.	1
I've been using elixers on my Godin Multiac Steel SA for many years now. They have a great, not-too-bright sound and you don't get the string noise when you move your hands across the neck like you do with traditional strings. These tend to last me about 3 months! So, I am very happy with them. They also track pretty well with my roland synth, so no gripes there. All in all I really like these strings and think they sound great.	1
I have been playing guitar for 5 years, and have purchased these strings 3 times. I have an acoustic-electric Yamaha APX and the light medium strings are perfect for me. These strings last a while for me. I play almost everyday and I each pair lasts me 4-5 months. I also use a Kyser capo and the strings don't stretch out half as fast as any other strings I've used. I definitely recommend these strings to any guitar player, just make sure you choose the right thickness for your guitar. Overall fantastic product!	1
I use only Elixir, and the acoustic phosphor bronze nanoweb are my strings of choice.  They not only sound great, with just the right amount of brightness, but they last at least 3 months longer than other non-coated strings. I'm not kidding. I gig three or four times a month in pubs and play every single day, and they last and last. And the coating makes it a bit easier on your fingers, too (I got a set of Martin acoustics as a gift from a friend and put them on my main guitar -- the tips of my fingers were taking a beating! And the strings didn't last more than two or three weeks before "that smell of rust" could be detected.  That just doesn't happen with Elixirs).	1
Im an amateur at the acoustic, I love these strings. They feel great and sound great, and with the nanoweb coating, they last FOREVER! Ive stuck with elixirs for years, and will continue to :)	1
I have a Yamaha acoustic guitar. I love it, but it certainly isn't top of the line. Also, I'm a very casual guitar player. So, fighting with strings and having strings "go bad" when the guitar sits there in the case is a problem.  Anyway, bottom-line: these strings solved a lot of problems for me. The strings feel easier on my fingers. They last longer. The sound is softer (less twangy). They are just great strings. I don't mind paying a bit more, because I'd prefer to change my strings less often. And, as a non-professional guitar player, that's the most important thing for me.  By the way, it took me much too long before I tried these strings. I have no idea why. But on my electric bass guitar the Elixir strings came factory installed. And I loved them. And on my electric guitar, some coated DR (neon) strings came pre-installed. And I loved those. So I have no idea why I kept fighting with regular strings on my acoustic guitar. Finally, the light bulb turned on and I thought: why not buy Elixir's for my acoustic too? I did, and I loved it. I felt like an idiot for not considering coated strings before. With my play style, "set it and forget it" strings are great. The fact that they are softer/easier on my fingers is just a bonus, because my level of finger-tip callouses is always a bit random depending on how much I've been playing recently.	1
I buy Elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now. They last the longest and hold the brightest and clearest tone of any string I've ever used. The nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference. They take several months to wear out (as opposed to the weeks other major brands last). They may cost a bit more than the competition, but if you try them and love them as much as I do, you'll never use anything else again.	1
I have used Elixir for a long time and still find that they are the best strings available. I have never had a single issue with them whether they were for my 12 string, my Taylor acoustic/electric, my Fender Strat or my mandolin. They always perform well and sound great.	1
I use these strings on all my acoustics (Gibson and Taylor). They have a nice feel and a mellow tone.	1
Im a huge fan of Elixir's!!!  This, however, is my first go with the polyweb, but there is no disappointment here!!	1
You cannnot go wrong with Elixir accoustic guitar strings.  Taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another.  However, you cannot go wrong with those strings.  I highly recommend them.  I like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings I have tried.	1
Excellent Seller! Item as described! Quick Shipping!  Highly recommended!	1
Very articulate and last for a very long time. Hold there tuning very well once you properly stretch them. Nice bright voicing.	1
It's a great product it's worth what you pay for	1
I have been using these for 32 years. No need to try something else when these have been proven to be winners. Strong, not brittle. Great tonality.	1
If you like a brighter crystal clear tone like I do these are the strings for you. I started out usuing GHS strings the first 5 or 6 years of playing because thats what SRV used and everyone was trying to find his tone however I got experimental and tried some D Addarios and fell in love. Ive tried every string under the sun but nothing compares to the crisp bright tone of D Addario.	1
I have never used any other strings apart from these ones. Color coding is effective for easy changing, good sounding strings.	1
Great strings. Nice and simple	1
I've tried every string brand out there and I always come back to D'Addario. XLs on my electrics and Phosphor Bronzes on my acoustics. I use these 12s on my SG that I play slide on. The heavy string tension helps me avoid hitting the frets.	1
none at this time	1
Elixer strings are the best strings. They feel great sound great and last forever. I would highly recommend them! 5 stars!	1
I only use elixir strings, they are without question the best, they may seem pricey until you consider they last three times as long as sound great, I have used these strings for over 10 years	1
I can't recall if I ever paid enough attention to prefer the Nano's to the Polywebs, but I'm still all Elixirs, whether on the Martin or the Taylor.	1
I've been playing guitar for about 15 years - and within the last year bought my first Taylor guitar (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Taylor-Guitars-414CE-LTD-Grand-Auditorium-Acoustic-Electric-Guitar/dp/B004Y7BZ1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Taylor Guitars 414CE-LTD Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar</a>). It came with these Elixir strings on it from the factory. I am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce. What's even better is how long they last.  I'm pretty hard on my strings. I use&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dunlop-Standard-Tortex-Picks-12-Pack-Purple-1-14mm/dp/B0002GX7ZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dunlop Standard Tortex Picks, 12 Pack, Purple, 1.14mm</a>&nbsp;which are very stiff, and chew up strings very quickly. The nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several MONTHS instead of weeks. They're a little bit more expensive then other major string brands. But after about a year of listening to these (only gone through 3 sets so far), they're worth the extra few bucks.	1
I have a Taylor 210e and I won't put anything on it but Elixir strings.  They don't go dead for a long time and do not rust.  Try them on any guitar and see the difference.	1
My guitar sounds great.  I love these strings and will purchase them again.  I put these on an Alveraz guitar and it really sounds better than my Martin.	1
They last forever, they aren't hugely expensive, and they sound great.  What more do you want?  I particularly like the lasts forever point....	1
I've used many other brands but Elixir is the best on sound and comfort. Not cheap but worth the price.	1
I always use elixir strings.  they last a really long time and they don't get rusty and gross like other strings.	1
the best string i simply will not change never any more because the quality of these strings. i strongly recomended them	1
Always the Best set of strings for all of my electric guitars.  Can't get any better than this.	1
I first came to know the company after I received a gift bag full of D'Addario products after performing at the Guitar Foundation of America. Their classical guitar strings are of the highest quality and their electric guitar counterparts are no different. They provide a crisp Ponta cello sound in comparison to a muddy sound other strings tend to give you. The best string for me in all honesty.	1
There are D'Addarios, and Elixirs, nothing else counts.  If you are on a budget, get the DAddarios.  These feature X-Light top strings for easy fretting, and heavy bottoms, for added thump.  Great for your Les Paul type guitars (that's what mine are on.)	1
Great strings, shipped quick.	1
Lovely as always  They stay tuned and last much	1
I've been an Ernie Ball man for almost 20 years and their Not Even Slinky strings were my favorite for tuning to drop C on a 25.5" scale guitar. However, after playing in standard E tuning for several years consistently, I've been slow tweaking my gauges and this might just be my favorite. I always felt the Ernie Ball Skinny Top Heavy Bottom set to be to skinny on top, and the Power Slinky set to be a little thin on the bottom. Beefy Slinkys were just a bit too heavy, so this set is just what I was looking for. They feel slightly different than the Slinkys (they don't have as much of the "springiness") but that's a personal preference and a very minute one at that.  If Ernie Ball made this gaugethen I'd probably those just because I prefer individually "packaged" strings over the color-coding system :)	1
I mainly use this and the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vater-Vintage-Bomber-Beater/dp/B00080SEAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vater Vintage Bomber Beater</a>&nbsp;as my preferred beaters (I also use more modern style ones occasionally.)  The reason I like this particular design is it allows you to feather the bass drum or lay into it depending on what the music requires. I can achieve a wide dynamic range with it. Note: I play heel down and do not use any bass drum muffling beyond a felt strip behind my bass drum heads. I mention those facts because if your playing technique or set-up may lead to a different opinion of this beater.  As I mentioned, I do use other beaters sometimes, so have some basis of comparison for the feel of different beaters on the same pedal. The heavy top of this beater gives a certain momentum when you are playing fast. I am sure it has to do with the center of gravity and weight, but am only guessing. The beater itself is densely packed, so you can get near the same effect as you can from a wooden beater head. But because it is felt, you can get softer notes if you feather it.  With a non- or minimally-muffled bass drum you can easily coax old school sounds with this beater - something you will be hard pressed to do with some of the modern beaters with light heads and multiple faces. Of course, you will still need the technique to do so, but this beater allows it more than most other ones on the market.	1
Best strings in the market hounds down. Amazing that given all the technology in the world these strings are still unparalleled.  Often imitated but never duplicated, get elixirs and nothing else!	1
This is the only brand I would ever buy the sound is superior and easy to play. These are well worth the money!	1
These are really good strings, but somewhat expensive.  These strings last a good while & easy on the fingers.  Will continue to use.	1
This is my brand of choice.  I use them on my Taylor acoustic and the sound is just better than some of the others I've tried (brighter/crisper).  I've tried Martin's on it as well and while they worked out fine, I felt it was worth the extra couple bucks to get these.	1
Elixir strings are always the best and the work so well on the Taylor guitar we put them on. Thanks	1
I feel like a wimp using extra light strings on my acoustic, but it's helpful for me, particularly when playing barr chords. The strings sound good too. Good tone and resonance. I don't feel as if I lost anything going from light strings. It's too early to comment on life. Time will tell.	1
good price for a bundle of strings, cant go wrong with extra strings :)	1
good buy on these strings	1
My Strats love these!	1
Nothing sounds better than a new set of strings!! these strings are very light and feel good on my fingers. For the price, you really can't beat em'. I cant get over the difference in sound that my guitar makes with these strings on her. LOVE LOVE LOVE these strings.	1
High quality, great tone, great for blues, rock	1
NICE STRINGS FOR A GREAT PRICE.	1
quite nice on my Les Paul Standard	1
good strings	1
I've had this string set on my guitar longer than any other string set. They still sound great and haven't corroded. My only complaint is that the .074 low string is just not the right gauge for anything other than F# standard tuning. If you want to do Drop E (which is a super common tuning for an 8 string) the tension isn't enough. It would be great if D'Addario made the same set with a .080 low string instead, which would allow for both F# standard or Drop E.	1
Great strings, I like to put them on my acoustic to get a very bright thin sound.	1
The price and the quality. Everything is perfect!	1
My favorite strings of all time.	1
Very great strings. My guitar wouldn't handle them though because of the shorter scale length etc. But still great strings and nothing was wrong with them.	1
D'Addarion never let me down....I've used it for over 12 years! without any complaint.	1
I've  used D'addarios for years, best strings made IMHO. These EXL-140s are my new favorite gauge .. ... I have them on my Strats and my Gretsch and Gibson hollowbodies.	1
What can I say, I LOVE THEM! I was seriously starting to question the tone of my guitar and then I put these strings on today. WOW! They are deep, rich, beautifully toned. They tuned without a fight to find the true note. I can FINALLY bend a string again without taking off a fingertip in the process. I've always been a hard core 80/20 phosphorus user but I thought why not give these a try. I will be buying more sets to keep on hand. I will check them for the next few days since they are fresh strings to see how long they hold a tune without going out, but I do love the way these sound and feel!	1
I have a 150.00 Epiphone and I have been using Elixir lights. Went to the medium and they greatly increased the volume of the guitar.	1
These last a long time, tone is fine, and have had no problem with breaking.  I've only had a few strings break in over 10-15 years of using Elixirs.  Very durable.	1
This is the third set of Elixer strings that I bought through Amazon and I love it. They're easy on the fingers.  I now replace my guitar strings every year and each time my Gibson guitar sounds like new. Even my old Wasburn sounds like new with these strings.	1
Depending which strings you are changing from, after installing them you may think you just bought a new and better guitar.  Desired tonal qualities are always a personal choice, but for me they provide as much brightness as I would ever desire and the warmness I  love.  They feel slicker than standard strings which can take a little getting used to, but I now prefer the feel.  It cuts down on string noise and is a little easier on your fingers.  These strings cost a bit more than other strings which some try to justify on the basis of string life.  I change my strings on a pretty regular basis so I really do not know if they offer better life compared to other coated strings so for me it is more about sound quality and playablity vs. string life and it is definitely worth a few extra dollars given the amount of time you spend with a set of strings.	1
convenient presentation, no more search strings at midnight. The sound is nice.	1
On time LOVE THESE STRINGS	1
good strings at a great price	1
good strings at a great price	1
Excellent strings.	1
Loved the tone and punch.	1
good strings	1
These strings brought to life a student's guitar of mine I tried them out on.  And, hopefully they will sustain longer.	1
good strings	1
Excellent quality and sound.	1
I've been searching for a decade. These are the ones.	1
I had problems keeping my guitar in tune in sets with an unwound third (G) string.  I have been using theses for as long as I can remember.  I started using them on my 73 LP and was sold based on the sound and tuning stability.  I have a couple of inexpensive Squires and they hold their tune as well.  I recently purchased an FMT Tele with Jumbo Frets - a first for me.  I was constantly pulling the notes sharp (too much pressure from my fingers on the strings I guess).  These are a little heavier than the strings that came with the guitar and I am no longer going crazy because the guitar seems to be constantly out of tune.  It is a little more difficult to bend the wound third, but it is not much of a trade off for me.	1
Strings 5 and 6 (b and high e) broke as I was putting them on, not as good as the EXL 140s. unfortunately cant afford to buy a new pack to restring my PXD void 1.	-1
My brand and gauge for many years. A great American made string set.	1
My brand and gauge for many years. Great strings that are made in America.	1
I see no reason to even waist my time with other strings. I have tried many others and none of them last as long as these, worth the money.	1
I love these strings because i hate changing my guitar strings all the time.  These prove to be long lasting and quality strings	1
I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes.  I used d'addarios for many years. I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable.  they sound great too. The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating.	1
These strings fit the Bill perfectly for "MY" desired sound from a Yamaha LJ-16 Acoustic Guitar which has been "Doctored" with Bone Saddle, Pins and nut. When I decided to put the money into the guitar, it was my belief that the Elixir Strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that I like so much in the LJ-16 and after all the work was completed......that proved to be true to form. I did move to the Medium for a little improvement from the Bass side and it's a most outstanding sound from a medium price, hand crafted guitar. Elixir has the best (most comfortable) feel, to me, of all the strings that I've tested and these provide the best (for my liking) sound on this guitar. Try them if it's quality sound that you're looking for..............These are great!!!!	1
Was unsure what to buy for my taylor guitar plan on using if the occasion arises. Where packaged great will last a long time.	1
They do last much longer than "normal" strings and in the long run are probably cheaper because of that long life.	1
What an I say, excellent strings when you can get them for $10-$12. I don't buy them at retail.  I prefer the nano's to the polly's (google).  And the 80/20's to the phosphor bronze for sound, but that would depend on your woods, and the sound you want. I sometimes use Phosphor Bronze on my all Maple, to offset the brightness of maple.  These are my fsvorite strings.	1
What can I say, I am a string snob! Ive tried MANY different kinds of strings for my acoustics and the Elixir Nanowebs are by far the best strings I have ever played.  I had a set of another major brand on a cheap Washburn I bought, and I changed them out with these strings and WOW what a HUGE difference. The guitar has such a great ring to it.  Also use these on my Taylors. These will give any quitar a beautiful voice!  Pros: Life Sound Playability Quality and Durability  Cons: Price	1
I only really have one complaint. The coating just does not feel right somehow. The sound is interesting. You have to get used to them. The only thing for me is that I feel I not really playing. They are kind of neat but is it not the same. I think I will have to try a lot more different Regular strings. My view or another persons view does not cut it. You have to try things for your self. Even though they are kind of neat in some ways I will move on for the time being. They are worth trying one time though. If you had a lot of guitars and could put some on one that you only used when you wanted to and the cost did not bother you, then I would have given them a five star. Coating is just not that great to have to have on all the time. My experience is limited. If I get more experience and change my mind I will come back and amend. These strings have not held up at all for me. I would not even recommend them if you had more than one guitar. I do not see they are any better than regular cheaper strings. I do not feel they are as good either.	-1
These strings sound great, play great, and the coating really does keep down the squeaking. Some purists don't like the coating movement when it comes to strings, and it does take a micron off the treble, but they last a loooong time. I usually only have to change my strings once a month. I use them on my Washburn acoustic guitar, and play rock, folk, and country strumming. They rock, and I feel they are the best strings around today, period.  These strings are very small, and are great for playing for long periods of time, without brutalizing the fingertips. Some people say the real light strings are not good for recording, and you probably have less of a bass boom, but I like 'em.	1
The first time I tried these strings was on March 27th 1979. Not only did I find them quite shrill, less than 24 hours later the partial meltdown at the 3 Mile Island nuclear power plant occurred.  Then years later I heard some changes had been made to this product so I thought I'd give them another shot. That was on April 25th 1986 and again less than a day later another disaster at a nuclear facility, the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine. Coincidence? Perhaps.  Finally in early March 2011, with the advent of the newly developed "Nanoweb" coating I decided to give these strings one last try. Those poor people at Fukushima.  I would highly recommend you not use these strings and try John Pearse 200L's instead. Not only are the Elixers excessively bright, who knows what sort of disaster may be averted by not using them?	-1
I have absolutely no gripes with Elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings. I have been using them since the first appeared on the scene and have become my go-to brand. I've read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage. I have yet to ever break an Elixir acoustic guitar string (in over 10 years of playing them). Can't even imagine. The only other coated string that may be a little better is Clear Tone--but I have had inconsistencies with them and because they cost more, I just go with Elixir and am never disappointed. I'm not a fan of the "Polyweb" which has a much more visible thick coating. The nano-webs get it right--they last a long time, sound great, and as far as I know don't flake polymer dust in your kisser.	1
On a friends recommendation I put them on a 'beater' ovation that I use when playing outside or with alternate tunings. They are now going on every guitar I own :) .Get 'em, you won't be disappointed.	1
I knew specifically what I wanted, it came right away, it was exactly as I expected it would be, perfect	1
Love D'Addario strings! I've tried many different guitar strings and a few of my guitars demand different types. But overall for my electrics, these strings seem to have a consistent tone and wear. I change frequently (once a month and I rotate my 10 guitars in and out of play a lot) but I like to feel that I will always be able to depend on the same tone every time I pick up one of my guitars. These strings help me get that.	1
Great for drop tuning.	1
Excellent strings	1
11's are my fave.	1
Heavy strings, went on very easily. Has a big tone and allows more downtuning than other sets. Very good strings as I would expect from D'Addario.	1
They came fast, but packed not to well. Box damage. Yet these are great strings to use.  SW	1
Good strings.	1
Shortly after I bought the MG82CX, I bought this adapter. When I first bought the mixer, I thought it was a little silly to mount it to a mic stand, but after my band's first gig, I quickly realized that this is a necessity.  The adapter mounts securely to a standard mic stand and screws into the bottom of the mixing board using two steel screws. Make sure you don't tighten them too much. Make them snug and they'll hold your mixer securely. I bought a mic stand with a round base ([...]) and it's a stable platform. I can easily mix our sound with one hand while playing my keyboard with the other.  The screws are secured to this adapter via two plastic washers. I have had to push the washer down on the screws a few times because I was afraid the washer would fall off while I was transporting gear to a gig. Something to be aware of, but not really a problem at all.	1
I needed a microphone stand mount to mount a Yamaha 6 channel mixer to a mic stand and this was just what I was looking for! I tried to engineer one myself, but I couldn't do it for less than what I bought this one for. The mount lines up perfectly to the bottom of my mixer and I had it mounted in minutes. The adaptor arrived quickly, undamaged and what a great price. $20!!!	1
This Mounting Adaptor BMS10A from Yamaha is made with precision and works perfect for mounting a mixer to a mic stand.	1
I love these strings. My acoustic Gibson Guitar sounds so much better after replacing the old strings, which were Elixer's too but about 6 years old. I'm going to replace my strings every two years now.	1
Yes they are more expensive, but they do get more mileage and are worth it to me.  However, they are hard to justify on cost alone.  I typically get 1.5 to 2X more life out of them and that isn't enough to offset the cost altogether.  But, I also like how they play and sound.  The nanoweb coating definitely cuts down on the screeching when sliding up and down the neck, and I like that they stay fairly bright and tunable longer than standard strings.  Also, I only play my guitar once or twice a week and typically change srings 3 or 4 times per year with these.  Cost impact is minimal.  I think they are not quite as bright out of the package as new Martins or d'Addarios, but that brightness drops off pretty quickly regardless.  After that initial breakin, they stay good longer.  I've played both, the phosphor bronze and 80/20 bronze.  I can't say that one is better than the other, but the phosphor bronze is mellower while the 80/20 is brighter.  It depends on you and your guitar as to which you will like best.  My guitar is naturally mellow to begin with, so I like the brighter sounding 80/20s.	1

Very happy with Elixir strings on all my instruments.  Very long life and good sound throughout.  Even when they are getting old and the coating is looking a bit ragged, the crisp sound stays there 'til the end.  Thanks for offering!	1
Very satisfied with Elixir strings.  The coating does start to shred after awhile but they still sound good even when they're approaching end of life and look a bit ragged.  Seem to be consistent products, thanks for offerings!	1
I build solid body electric guitars professionally and have played for over 50 years - so I know guitar strings. I always use Elixir strings on my personal acoustics. They are a superior quality product - worth the extra cost. They last much longer and retain their tone well beyond regular strings. .	1
They feel great, last longer than any other string I ever used and most importantly, they sound terrific. The medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges. My Taylor is much louder now that I use these. However, you may have to adjust your truss rod if you change from lite or extra light.	1
really bright sound and play great. brings new life into my acoustic. won't record with anything less than these strings	1
The strings help bring out a higher tonality to my guitar	1
Great strings for my electric guitars.  Long lasting, keeps the tuning and are one of my favourite strings.	1
awesome sound	1
Great strings!	1
Great strings!	1
Finally found the .60 ga. low E string I've been looking for and with my B.C. Rich Warlock and Seymour Duncan Blackout pickups, I'm pretty sure Kerry King himself would be impressed.	1
They last longer than Ernie Ball.	1
They costed twice as much as my usual D'Addarios but after 2 weeks of use, I couldn't be any happier. I've heard only positive reviews about these Elixir strings and now understand why. They are smooth as butter thanks to the coating and sound bright, clean, and crisp. They also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier. A great buy overall.	1
I purchased the Elixir strings a couple of years ago to compliment the Martin guitars I bought for my husband and step daughter for Christmas . My husband (whom was already an avid guitar player) had been talking about teaching his daughter to play for as long as I can remember. They were thrilled with the guitars and my husband said the Elixir strings were an excellent choice. I would definitely recommend this product to others.	1
When I bought my alverez guitar. it had the strings on it I've been using this brand ever since. I get about 9 months out of these I use to get 6 weeks out of a set of dean markleys this is the way to go!!!	1
Cheap guitar+awesome strings= expensive sounding guitar  After stringing and tuning, the first strum taken was noticeably improved. Imagine giving Janis Joplin the ultimate lozenge. That's what happened.  I love the sound.	1
Sound great	1
Strings. They got 'em. I bought 'em. 3 packs. More for your money. 10-52s, like 10-46s, but better if you drop tune. ... I've got nothin' else. They're good strings. Never had a complaint. Pick your sellers carefully, though, as I got a pack from 2011, so not exactly a fresh pack, if that matters to you. Though I will admit, despite that, the strings themselves were flawless. That D'Addario packaging is no joke, apparently.	1
Heavy and bulky.  Great for tuning but sucks as a keychain.	-1
I played these strings for like three months and still don't sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I've also been watching all his old interviews on YouTube and not once does he admit to the fact that he would have been nothing without this particular gauge of strings.  Nor does he cop to the fact that he used a plain 20 for the G string.  I am not impressed.  I will never play 13s again until I hear an official apology from his estate.  Music used to mean something, man.	-1
This was very difficult to use as a temporary fixture for going on and off a stage setup. Perhaps if it was fixed in 1 place for an extended period of time such a studio it would be helpful.	-1
Having played electric guitar almost exclusively for nearly 3 decades, I only recently switched my focus to acoustic. With a new Takamine in hand, I desired a warmer tone than I was getting with the stock strings so I purchased some wood bridge pins (to replace plastic ones) and these Elixir coated strings based on the handful of reviews claiming how much of a difference it made. The Verdict. Warmth, maybe. But the sound seems discolored. Less bright and perhaps warmer on the high end, but not as "bottomy" or balanced/round on the lower end. But sound aside, I ran into problems when installing these strings as my low E broke at the ball-end after just a few bends and insertion attempts. Never had a low E defect in 30 years of changings strings. High E perhaps, but never low E. Anyway with a few twists and turns, I made a makeshift knot at the end and got the set installed. So for now, I'm still playing on them. Don't "LOVE" them as far as tone, but I'll give it a break-in period and revise my rating if somehow  my opinion of these "top of the line" strings improves enough to overlook the intital defect / poor quality I first experienced.	-1
Elixir Polywebs are not for most guitars, but in some cases they can help improve overly bright, harsh sounding guitars that need to be mellowed down a bit. Other than that I didn't like them at all on my guitars. So much for the Polywebs. However, the Nanoweb 80/20s are a whole different story. My all time favorite guitar strings are the Elixir 80/20 Nanowebs --it takes them a little while to break in, but once they do, they just get better and better... and they last a long, long time.	-1
After around 10 years of using these, I am finally switching to a different brand. The last 4 3set packs I have purchased came with at least 1 string deffective. Waste of time and money. Sometimes you can tell the string is deffective right away, but other times it takes a few strummings. This last one started to de-tune by itself brand new.	-1
I've tried these on several guitars of mine, including a Martin HD28, a Guild D15, a Guild JF-30 and a Guild F212XL.  Yes, they last a long time, but the new sound can't compare with a conventional string.  To me they sound moderately fatigued from the beginning, with a loss of sparkle and high end.  On the 12 string they were acceptable, but that guitar had an abundance of highs to begin with.  If playing amplified with a pickup they sound OK, but otherwise I don't want an expensive new string that sounds somewhat tired from the beginning.  I'd rather use conventional strings and change them more often than play these.  The Cleartone strings to my ear sound much better.	-1
not happy ...	-1
Does not work with Yamaha product I purchased it for	-1
The first two sets of strings were fine, loved them. Just opened the third pack and found they'd left out the 1st and 2nd (E & B) strings. Bought them long enough ago that I can't ask for a refund - which I wouldn't ask for since I already used two sets. But I do think they should send me my other two strings.	-1
They're probably fine for standard 7 string tuning. However, on my Ibanez RG7 string they're incredibly loose and wobbly even when tuned down a half-step from standard. Bottom line if you're playing in anything other than standard don't even bother. Personally I don't even really like these anyway but they are not the worst strings for the price.	-1
Yeah, so after breaking 6 Ernie Ball high e strings in a row on my Parker Fly AND Parker NiteFly SA I ordered Electro Harmonix and broke that one too, then I ordered these with the reinforced ball ends- to discover that YOU GAVE ME TWO LOW E STRINGS AND NO A STRING IN THIS  PACKAGE.  Thanks, so so much for that.  So far the D'Addarios are the only strings that have not broken instantly.  You guys in the string business seriously need to get it together.  I think I'm in over one hundred bucks on stringing these two guitars and it has been some kind of surreal nightmare.	-1
Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says "Heavy Duty" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead.	-1
Its poorly made with attention to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not screw down all the way and are losse. It is useless!!! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine.	-1
I bought these strings to use for my 6 string to tune to drop B ..what I got was no 54 gauge string and 2 extra light strings !!! So I was disappointed ..won't buy again	-1
I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store.  Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string.  Have 2 problems with the strings.  First, the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up.  Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir).  I have changed strings many, many times, so I am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the E string itself.  Second, the high D (8th string) seems "dead"; it does not "ring" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used).  Considering these strings cost much more than others, I certainly am disappointed in them.  Hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good.	-1
Sorry, but this Shubb needs work! It has too much curvature for the thickness of the sleeve. I had to flatten it a bit with a mallet to get it close with the sleeve that's not as thick/effective as the std DeLuxe model. I wasted my money	-1
Not the best strings.	-1
I recently purchased these strings twice within the same month. The first set's G string popped while I was tuning from Drop C to E standard as slow as possible and almost immediately after I started winding it popped. Then my high e string popped while loosening it from E Standard to Drop C. The second set I bought five days ago and when I set it up in E Standard and it played perfectly fine then I tuned it to Drop C; everything fine. Suddenly while starting to tune back to E Standard not even turning the peg a quarter of the way "snap!"  it broke. I do not recommend these strinags, particularly for their inability to be tuned back and/or forth, even slowly without breaking. For this reason I recommend Ernie Ball or Fender strings. The only positive thing I have to say about these strings is the bright, clear, soft tone along with their great ability to stay in tuning once tuned better than some brands such as Ernie Ball.	-1
Strings feel nice, easy on my fingers which helps a lot since I'm just starting to play. Sound quality is good, not much more I can say about the sound since I am a beginner and won't pretend to be a guru or anything about that. As for the longevity of the strings, maybe I just got a defective string, but the #1 string (high e) broke rather quickly. The rest of the strings are still fine. I'm just disappointed that it broke so quickly, it didn't even last as long as my previous strings even though it boasts that it lasts 3x longer.	-1
Got these for my kids guitar thinking they'd be easy on his fingers.  They're too thin.  They barely register on the pickups, presumably no enough mass to get a good response.  They also go sharp way too easy if you play chords.  Switched to 9's.  These are horrible.	-1
I only really have one complaint. The coating just does not feel right somehow. The sound is interesting. You have to get used to them. The only thing for me is that I feel I not really playing. They are kind of neat but is it not the same. I think I will have to try a lot more different Regular strings. My view or another persons view does not cut it. You have to try things for your self. Even though they are kind of neat in some ways I will move on for the time being. They are worth trying one time though. If you had a lot of guitars and could put some on one that you only used when you wanted to and the cost did not bother you, then I would have given them a five star. Coating is just not that great to have to have on all the time. My experience is limited. If I get more experience and change my mind I will come back and amend. These strings have not held up at all for me. I would not even recommend them if you had more than one guitar. I do not see they are any better than regular cheaper strings. I do not feel they are as good either.	-1
The first time I tried these strings was on March 27th 1979. Not only did I find them quite shrill, less than 24 hours later the partial meltdown at the 3 Mile Island nuclear power plant occurred.  Then years later I heard some changes had been made to this product so I thought I'd give them another shot. That was on April 25th 1986 and again less than a day later another disaster at a nuclear facility, the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine. Coincidence? Perhaps.  Finally in early March 2011, with the advent of the newly developed "Nanoweb" coating I decided to give these strings one last try. Those poor people at Fukushima.  I would highly recommend you not use these strings and try John Pearse 200L's instead. Not only are the Elixers excessively bright, who knows what sort of disaster may be averted by not using them?	-1
Didn't like so much not as good quality	-1
It doesn't come with any assembly instructions but, you should be able to figure it out..  When sitting on the stool playing guitar, both feet are not going to touch the ground unless your are in the NBA. So, you can't lean back really. It looks good but, isn't functional. It really is for aesthetic purposes only. Don't buy it...You don't need it.	-1
2 strings broke while stretching them and can't get hold of D'Addario on their website!!! A little upset!!!!!!;;!;	-1

Amazing at first but after not playing for 3 weeks in my case they got rusted really bad...might go back to elixirs or other strings that won't rust as fast.	-1
Some say that this will fix all of your G String issues on a LesPaul type of guitar (I have a Gretsch Pro Jet). While this is true, it will also kill the tone of the guitar. I am not sure why, but this one string made a large impact on the tone of my guitar and I felt like I was playing a very dull guitar with almost no high end capabilities. This was a deal breaker for me since this made the guitar's high end (which is already the weak link on any LesPaul type guitars) even worse.  I would only recommend these string to someone who plays jazz and similar styles and has a tuning issue. Ohterwise I would say they take away more than they give.  In short, while it may fix the tuning issues with the G string it will also affect your tone negatively.	-1

Hi! I clearly remember buying a set of 10 normal light strings D'Addario (10-46). And i just received one set of strings. I mean ... apparently you made a mistake. you sent me a package of one set of strings, when in fact buy the set of 10. I really need to solve my problem because i want to keep my instrument working. I hope you can help me to give my opinion on the matter.  Thanks in advance for your attention...	-1
4 of the strings snapped Two high E's Two B's	-1
Was pretty fast shipping but the strings make a strange sound. When you play you can hear an extra sound that shouldn't be there.	-1
I've been using daddario for over a decade and I got really disappointed. the first set I opened was okay, but the second featured a very prolongued coating defect. I don't intend to return the whole package because I'm not living in the US now. but I definitely won't buy another.	-1
when I was young 12's were good .....at 70 not anymore	-1

CAD is universally known, at least in my circles, as super low quality cheap stuff. From the mics to instruments to accessories. I thought maybe, this pop screen would be difference, since it's pretty basic. But nope, CAD continues it's flaws.  The packaging of this thing was just plain horrible, it was so folded it up, I was afraid to even open it for fear it was already broken. Maybe that means it was a used item?? I dunno.  After one day of use, and attaching it to a vocal mic stand, the pop screen fell off. The screw was tightened really good, and should have held it, but it just came out. I got it to stay on, but any sudden movements, or a light breeze from the air condition, and this thing is coming off.  Not worth paying the shipping to return it, and will not buy any CAD items ever again	-1

I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.  Secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.  I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6" pop filter.  If you don't, you'll wish you did.	-1

This pop filter is very cheaply made.  The clamp that is at the "bottom" of the plastic ring which allows it to be mounted to the bendable arm fell off after just a few uses.  I currently have just the pop filter rubber-banded to my mic.  Looking for one that is better made.  Avoid...	-1
The early-mid 60's Fender Super Reverb has taken its place among the most sought-after of vintage guitar amps.  You won't find one in decent shape for under $2000 now.  Fender's marketing dept. was right on in bringing back this classic.  Too bad they dropped the ball.  The two I have played through sounded nothing like the original Super Reverb.  One of them was falling apart in the store!  The other was at a recording session.  I used it for all of ten minutes before switching to another amp.  I couldn't say whether or not the electrical circuit has been accurately replicated, but I do know the one huge difference between this "reissue" and an original.  The original Super Reverbs were hand-wired, and hand-soldered.  These are constructed using printed-circuit boards and 'wave' soldering.  Any amp guru will tell you that there is a huge difference, and there are some of these guys that charge $600+ to hand re-wire "reissue" amps to vintage specs using the point-to-point method.  Fender does build many fine amplifiers and they are presently building some "Custom Shop" amps that are hand-wired replicas and sound tremendous.  The prices are justifiably higher for the labor involved.  It's a shame they didn't elect to include this classic in that catalogue.	-1
Bought it, returned it. Low volume,no mids,barley cut a bar gig. This is a Vibro not a Deluxe or a jr! Very Disappointed. All my friends were to. All blues pro's. I use a vibro in Europe on the road,this amp is 1/3 the volume. Tried a few more around the city(NY) all like that.	-1
I tried two '68 Custom Deluxe Reverbs at home, and no matter how much I wanted to, didn't like either of them. The idea of having a vintage Fender Deluxe Reverb channel and a more modern channel (both with reverb and vibrato) is very seductive. The tone of this amp is exactly what I expected and was excited about, but three issues immediately raised their heads within the first fifteen minutes of unboxing both the amps I brought home.  The first issue was the hiss, that godawful hiss you can hear even when the volume pots are at "0" and there's nothing at all plugged in to either channel. At "0" the hiss on these amps is comparable to the hiss you would begin to hear on the '65 Deluxe Reverb and about "4.5" or "5". For someone like myself who plans to primarily use this amp at lower volumes at home, the hiss was unbearable; you can easily hear it under everything you play at lower volumes and you'd need a noise gate in your recording equipment to get rid of it if you planned to use the amp for recording. If you plan to use the amp at higher volumes (beyond "5") and in environments with high ambient noise, then I don't think it's really an issue.  The second issue is the ticking vibrato: Apparently it's quite common for the vibrato/tremolo in the 68 Deluxe Reverb to make a faint ticking sound that increases or decreases in frequency with the speed pot. In some amps it's apparently more noticeable, some less, some not at all, and in some it sounds like a faint whoosh (I heard it on three different amps). It's also an issue on the '65 Deluxe Reverb as well. If the Vibrato is turned off via the footswitch, the sound goes away entirely.  Unfortunately, if you intend to use this amp at low volumes in a quiet setting with the vibrato engaged the ticking sound might drive you batty. It did me. If you want to mic and record with it at low volumes (the clean volumes), you'll be unable to get rid of the ticking when the vibrato is engaged. However, if you plan to use the amp in louder settings at high volumes, then you probably either won't hear it mixed in with the amp's natural breakup or it won't bother you. At home I could easily hear it while playing at volumes in the clean range under "4"; In the broken up range beyond "5" it blends into the overall sound while you're playing.  Fender is apparently aware of this issue and considers it normal for both the '65 Deluxe Reverb and the '68 Custom Deluxe Reverb. According to a little internet research there is a potential fix for the tick if you take it to a knowledgeable tech. Fender is even aware of the fix (I read they published a service bulletin for it at some point), but I guess they decided the expense or time/attention to detail involved in implementing the fix during the manufacturing process isn't worth it. That's sort of disappointing to hear. If there wasn't a potential fix and it was simply an artifact of the vibrato that couldn't be gotten around, I'd have given the amp another star, but I think Fender loses that star for apparently being cheap and/or lazy.  The third issue is reverb feedback. Id read about it in a couple of forums and only experienced it on one of the amps I brought home. What can I say, it was deafening, and occurred when both the volume and reverb were turned up beyond 5. Not actually something Id normally do anyway, but it happened and I got the full dose of what others have mentioned. Ive read suggestions where putting some padding above the reverb tank fixes the issue, but then why doesnt Fender do that at the factory? I also didn't experience this with the 65 deluxe reverb, so Im guessing it has to do with the modifications to this amp that increase its baseline gain beyond that of the 65.  In sum, if you're chasing that clean Deluxe Reverb tone, also want a channel with a more full, modern tone, and either don't mind the hiss, or the ticking, don't use vibrato, or will be playing in situations where it's unlikely to be noticeable due to other ambient noise, and have some extra sound dampening foam laying about to cover the reverb tank, then, by all means, go for it. If you're like me and will be using it primarily at home or for recording and plan to use the vibrato, then I doubt you'll be excited at the prospect of paying over $1k for an amp with a bum ticker, a screaming reverb, and the vague hope that you can pay someone to fix it down the road (or take the time to do it yourself if you're skilled in that area). It's the sort of thing you'll either be able to live with and you'll love this amp regardless, or you won't. The many folks who give this amp high praise obviously don't mind the hiss, have had their hearing previously destroyed, or got lucky and have one in which the ticking isn't noticeable and the reverb doesnt feedback for some reason. For me that was far too many strikes against this amp, and I tried two from different stores and different manufacturing runs that both had these issues.	-1
I purchased this amp at my local Guitar Center. The amp actually sounds pretty amazing with a nice mix of smooth lows and cut through highs. It sounds bigger than it's 10 inch speaker. However, the main issue and why 2 stars... this amp has some serious cabinet buzzing/rattling on the lower register notes (mainly E, A and G). It's useless for recording and it was very annoying while practicing. I took it back to Guitar Center and tried a 2nd amp with the same annoying results. I read a few articles where players changed the speaker and tightened the baffle (never heard of a baffle until now) with positive results and the buzzing/rattling eliminated. But for the amount of money this amp cost I can't accept having to spend even money to fix something that never should have left the Fender factory. If I change speakers it will be because I desire a certain tone, not to fix a defect.  With that said, aside from the issue that I can't get past, it really is a great sounding amp. I was able to turn up to 5 with my Tele before it started to seriously breakup. I think it's a great practice amp and it could also be used on gigs where stage volume isn't to loud. It probably would need to be mic'd.  I love Fender products and use mostly Fender on my gigs. I was pretty excited to add a Silverface Princeton Reverb to my collection, but this has been pretty disappointing. I hope Fender addresses this. I ended up ordering a '65 Princeton Reverb hoping to get better results. We'll see...	-1
i don't know if i just got a dud but, i went through 3 high e strings in 3 days. the first one snapped before it could get to e, the second one snapped while loosening the string (seriously!?). and the third one just snapped while sitting in high e.	-1
This is way over priced. Sounds awful. Thin with no punch. Guess I will go with another Dr Z. Returned this little dud.	-1
I have six guitars that I need to keep fresh strings on, and I thought I was getting a deal here, but I was extremely disappointed when these strings lost their punch almost immediately. I usually can count on D'Adario for a good, long lasting clean sound, but these guys just deadened out so quickly that I'll be going back to Ernie's from now on.	-1
Not the real deal.  You would be better off to get an early 70's silver face and have a tech black face it.  Just a few component changes on a early 70's silver face and you have something far better than this reissue model.	-1
Sound is great but quickly fades with corrosion.	-1
I bought the Texas Specials a little over a year ago, thinking they would give me the pure SRV sound I was looking for. I installed them in a Maple fretboard Jimmie Vaughan model Fender Stratocaster. I never really 'disliked' them, but I never really fell in love with them either. I'm running my guitar thru a Fender Mustang 3 amp and sometimes a Vox VT20. The tone was just ALWAYS too 'harsh' for me. Seemed to always be breaking up, even at low volume. Turn up volume on guitar, breaking up. Turn up volume on amp, breaking up. Not in a good way. In a "wow that sounds like crap" way. In a really crinkling up aluminum foil type way. While the articulation is there, the shrill'ness just bothered the s outta me. As far as the tone, me personally, I never felt I achieved the SRV tone I was searching for. I recently swapped these out for Dimarzio pickups, an Area 58' in the neck, a True Velvet in the mid, and an Area 61' in the neck. This combination to me sounds a LOT more authentic and clean. The articulation is there, the clarity is there, and just the overall 'roundness' is there for me. Conclusion, after a YEAR of use, to me Texas Specials didn't hit the mark for Texas Blues or any blues for that matter. The only Blues I got was from spending $199. I don't know how these sound in a pure tube amplifier, so maybe that's where all the positive reviews come from. So good luck!	-1
Need I say more...if it is dirty get it cleaned at a music shop. Ifyou play your horn a lot you will be best to bring it to a music shop once a year and pay the $30-$50 to get it cleaned. If you have a professional instrument it will cost more. I know these sound appealing and seem so much cheaper then a cleaning. Let me know what you think when they are stuck inside your instrument... inevitably these will not clean much at all and you will end up at the music shop.	-1
Had to write this after buying one of these and then returning and trying a 2nd one. Both had serious issues that made them like a $200 amp. I used to own TWO of the PRRI (65 Princeton Reverb Re-issue) and LOVED them. Beautiful amp. When the 68 Custom arrived I was excited to have a warmer and easier to break up Princeton, along with the old school look.  I was not aware that the 68 here was made in Mexico (yet only $100 cheaper than the 65 PRRI) until after I purchased it.  When turning it on, it had a loud buzz and when the fever was turned up past 1 another loud buzz was layered on top of that. It was horrible rendering i useless for ANY recording.  Plugged in my guitar and it sounded like flabby mud. Turned down the bass to 0 and treble to 10 and it was better but the sound was dull and my Mustang II sounded better on the BF setting. Much better.  Put the volume past 2 and the cabinet rattled bad, put it past three and the tubes rattled so awfully it sounded like they would pop.  Tried another as well as the 68 Deluixe Reverb and BOTH had the same issues.  These are awful amps Cheaply made, rattling cabinets, bass heavy sound and I had to return and forget about it. The 65 PRRI is a much nicer amp in sound, quality and it takes pedals better than this 68.  So disappointed. Sounds like an old $200 crate amp from a few years back. Loose, rattly, dull, bass heavy and no chime or BF sound to speak of.	-1
Purchased this Amp brand new but it had a faulty reverb tank.  Even at lowest volume and intensity of reverb, a noticeable spring buzz and growling happened at what seemed to be lower tone registers.  Never experienced this before in any of the amps I had in the past ever.  I am very concerned about the workmanship at the California factory.  Although the amp was stamped made in California, there appears to be components from other countries in it.  I'd like to know who manufactured the reverb tank.  To test the reverb tank, I took it off the amp and sat the reverb away from the amp and put the tank on something other than the cardboard which it was seated on.  Same condition persisted.  Checked all tubes if they were loose as well and same condition.  Springs appeared un-damaged.  Not sure if this was a shipping issue or if defective from the factory..........  Update as of 9/26:  Received replacement (Note this was purchased through Sweetwater and Not Amazon) - When reverb engaged at any volume, feedback at any amount of reverb or input level when reverb is engaged.  The Feedback hum occurs with or without an input connected and only if the reverb is engaged.........  Now sending back the second and hoping the third will be the winner.  What is going on with Quality control at the Fender Plant in California ?????  This is an American built amp and a re-issue of a classic.  Just makes no sense considering I have a Pro Junior Amp and a Hot Rod Deluxe, both made at the Mexico Factory with NO ISSUES.  What is going on ?????  Update 10/1:  Received Third Replacement.  Seems better.  Reverb working without significant noise or Feedback issues.  There is a noticeable small hum when the Reverb is engaged and almost has that same type of hum most single coil pickups have.  Noticed the direction of the amp can be adjusted to minimize.  Outlets are grounded, but this amp is clearly much more noisy than my Hot Rod Deluxe amp.  That amp is plugged into the same electrical circuit and much more quiet.  I guess some amount of noise with the Princeton is expected to a degree since it is all tubes and RF interference can be problematic.  The question now is can I live with some of these issues if I will be recording this amp?  Time will tell.......One thing is for certain though.  If Fender had a chance to make a re-issue that was clearly not hand wired but PCB, then they should have made this amp much more quieter than the original.  Not sure if any of the noise issues were present on the original 65, but this could have been tweaked much more.  Cabinet Buzz and rattling issues - Some of the screws were not tight along the cabinet.  In an effort to stop some of the cabinet buzz I checked every screw and it did little for some of the issues with frequencies in the lower B spectrum.  Just insanely awful to have an amp that Is priced as a collectible on a vintage and have so many issue..........Result - Sending the Third back and getting a Full Refund.  I recommend not purchasing this amp.  Fender no longer knows how to produce this amp and test for such defects.	-1
Love the design features of this new Fender Amp. Sadly, had to return two of them, both with similar, serious problems. Did some online research and discovered that there are serious issues with this new model. Many people are having to do multiple returns to finally get one that works. This is clearly a quality control / manufacturing problem with Fender and not any fault of Amazon's or other retailers. So, I ended up having to order a different model (one with a good dependability record)  and will wait a year or so to see if Fender gets it's act together before trying one of these again. Too bad because I really wanted one.	-1
My low rating is based on two aspects: quality control and performance. I tried two identical sets of these pickups (one form amazon, another from elsewhere). With one set I ran into the same problem many other folks reported: a dead pickup. You don't need to install it in order to find it out: it is enough to measure the resistance between the wires. While it was correct on 2 pickups, it was infinite for the 3rd one, which means damaged wire.  The other set had all pickups alive, although I must say that the wire was unwrapping and falling off the body on one of the pickups. I installed them nevertheless and they worked. Now I want to comment on the performance. I was replacing ceramic pickups on an extra-cheap strat imitation guitar Giannini G-100 (from Costco) and naturally expected much better sound out of genuine Fender pickups. To my great surprise, the difference in sound was marginal. I of course tested all three pickup with clean and distorted modes. The worst part is that these pickups are much, much noisier than the original Giannini pickups. Even in "humbucking" 2nd and 4th switch position there was a lot of buzz, which is absent with the original pickups to which I returned.  The bottom line is, don't bother upgrading with Tex-Mex.	-1
I replaced em with dimarzio's....they're hum free	-1

Bridge pickup dead	-1
I returned these pickups as one did not work.	-1
There's always a first time and this happens to be "it". Tested before mounting for ohm stature. CLEARLY nowhere near the 5.6k advertised. How about 6.7/ 6.9/ 6.4 on two separate meters. I thought, ok, let's see how they sound. Installed...anticipating clack and cluck classic Fender Stratocaster sounds........one dead from the between 100 mV rms to over 1 V rms throughput and the solder failed. Took it to authorized Fender repair shop that's known world wide but in my hometown and a friend.....soldered it...short story long....the Squier pickups in the guitar I was hot rodding for my son, sounded infinitesimally better !! Sent them back, looking elsewhere , I've had a 1963 Stratocaster, '78'  '82  '96..2012, now two 2014's. At 65 yrs old I know what good sounds like, and those aren't it.	-1
Sorry for the 1 star rating but it was just to get your attention. I am sure these are great pickups but I saw a Fender Custom Shop 69 Pickup review on Youtube. Joe states the bridge pickup of the Texas Specials is too bright to be even useable. I also find this to be true on my 1996 American Standard. After watching the video I am going for the Fender 69s for the same price. Just saying, watch this video before purchasing the Texas Specials. Nothing against Texas but 69' sound cooler too. LOL Checkout the video at: [...]  PEACE!	-1
Why are SO MANY of the reviews for these pickups on this page for OTHER pickups, especially Noiseless - which these ARE NOT?!  I've had a bad experience with my set of Deluxe Drive Strat pickups. They are hot, yes, they are true single coil, yes. But even I was SHOCKED at the amount of hum these things make in high gain settings and with distortion pedals!! I mean, hell - I've got Strats with Fat 50s single coils and Texas Specials and even a set of Toneriders - all true single coil. But NONE of them come close to the almost shrieking hum these guys make! And in overdirve, the bridge pickup is so ice-pick sharp it will tear you head off. If you want pickups that can do anything, get the Fender Vintage or Hot Noiseless. Or better yet: the Dimarzio Area Set or Injectors.	-1
Sounds ok, durability really sucks... Just buy when there's not Elixir or Earnie Ball available.	-1
The worst, low quality strings I have ever used in over 3 decades of playing the guitar. I've used several different strings in my lifetime, from GHS Boomers to Fender Bullets, to my only true love, Ernie Ball Super Slinky's, and I have to say these are the absolute worst strings I've ever played... here is why... They NEVER stay in tune on any guitar I own (and I've tried themon several, from ESPs to Gibsons, to USA Fenders). I am CONSTANTLY tuning these POS strings. One chord after tuning and the whole guitar needs to be re-tuned. Next, they stay bright for about 2 hours. These are some of the deadest feeling/sounding strings I have ever played. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and I really do not know why so many people love these so much. I thikn it's because they are cheap and marketed well. Sadly, like I said... to me, worst string ever made. Makes sense I was buying these 10 packs for like $16.	-1
I decided to get this because I have 14 guitars and buying strings can get expensive. Plus these are the strings I prefer anyways. Had high hopes for it but even looking at the picture I thought "I wonder how they get the strings to not bind up inside?". The answer? They didn't. First string I went to grab was the low E. I followed the instructions and held the rest of the strings in place while pulling and it got stuck. Pulled as hard as I could without risking damage to the string and it would only come out about 6 inches...and then it wouldn't go back in. I tried another string, same thing. I now had 2 low E strings sticking out 6 inches from the box. I had no choice but to open the box up all the way, take apart the plastic spools inside, unwind ALL of the low E strings, and then try to wrap them back up again. The result? I now have 25 brand new low E strings with finger prints all over them. Thought my problems were over once I finished with the 3 wound strings. Nope. Sure enough went to grab a G and it got stuck. Took some serious coaxing to get it out. I would rather pay the extra money for 25 individual sets of these strings than ever get this bulk box again. They didn't even wrap each bundle of strings in protective sleeves either so by the time I use the last few sets they will probably be corroded and useless. Especially the low E's thanks to my prints. Basically what I'm saying is unless you are a guitar repair tech and plan on changing 25 sets of strings in one week do NOT buy this. Waste of money.	-1
Do not buy these strings for an Extended Range Guitar.  I have a 28.625 inch scale on my Agile 8 string and the lowest string (the 74), turns into a 50 before it reaches the nut.  Ernie Ball 8 string slinkies have the exact same problem.  The only manufacturer who doesn't skimp on winding the whole string seems to be DR for their Tite Fit Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes strings.	-1
I kept these on for about a week and switched to dunlop heavy core. They don't handle down tuning very well and they have a odd metal (not the music style) sound to them.	-1
You only get the pickups, and not the pots.  This put me in a bind, as I was building a guitar for somebody's Christmas gift and I had to scramble to find parts locally.  They sound great, and I might even like them better than my lace hot golds.	-1
I bought a set of 3 regular light gauge (.10) strings.  When I went to install the low E string, it must have been defective, because there was hardly any tension on the string I was winding when it broke just before the saddle.  I have included a picture of the break as a customer picture.  I was able to replace it with the low E string from the next set, however I'm still out a set of strings.  It isn't worth the hassle to return the pack, so I'm keeping them, but this'll probably be the last time I purchase from this brand.	-1
The Seymour Duncan website says it will fit in a sound hole from 3.85 to 4.25 inches in diameter.  The sound hole on my Seagull S6 is 3.875 and there is no way I could get this pickup into that sound hole without damaging the guitar.  And believe me, I tried.  And tried.  And tried.  I tried to the point where I damaged the finish on the guitar and broke the pickup.  Do NOT purchase this pickup if the soundhole on your guitar is less than 4" in diameter.  It fits fine in a Yamaha FG700S guitar I have that has a sound hole diameter greater than 4 inches.  I have contacted Seymour Duncan to request that they provide more accurate specs for this product.	-1
I've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go "flat" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster.	-1
Let me start off by saying 2 things...  One, i usually don't write negative reviews.. this one is important though because this product has taken away my favorite hobby for over a month now...  Two, that in not an amateur player and have been around guitars quite a bit in my life so I know what I'm doing with guitars...  I've played and used MANY different brands and types of strings and until now my two "go to" brands for good strings at a decent price were DR & D'Addario (Thomastic Infeld's are the best IMHO, but they fall well outside of the "decent price" genre...)  Anyway, About a month ago I needed some strings and since I had heard of the new BT sets from D'Addario I thought I'd give em' a shot....  I've regretted it ever since.... (I ordered the  EXL120BT's)  To the point.....  I install the strings, stretch them a little afterwards, tune em, clean/polish everything, spray a small coat of Fingerease and let it dry, etc...  My standard string install method I've used a 100x over or more with no problems or no noticeable issues...  Then i start to playing....  (biggest mistake I've made this year so far)....  Around 2 minutes into playing on the new strings (I use a few Gilmour solos to stretch the strings out after I install a set) I notice that my fingers on my left hand are REALLY starting to hurt, (especially my ring finger)....  When I stop and take a look at my fingers, I can see little tiny "fine hair" like metal splinters ALL OVER each finger, and a few of the larger normal sized splinters most of us have seen from time to time...  Some are really small and difficult to see without a magnifying glass, and, others are your standard metal shard, but ALL hurt like %#!$@!!!!  ESPECIALLY when you touch anything with those fingers... (You know, like a guitar fretboard for instance)  Fast forward to today....  And I SWEAR that I am not exaggerating....  I have not been able to play guitar since this happened due to the pain in my fingers, and I have pulled no less than 30 metal splinters from my middle, pointer and pinky finger on my left hand combined.... (I have finally gotten them all out as of about a week ago, which is around 3 weeks after the "incident")  As for my ring finger, the last count on it was 63 metal splinters (most being the little fine hair-like ones that are difficult to see without a good magnifying glass and get out without precision tweezers, but feel like knife wounds when you touch a hard object) that I have removed...  There are still several in this finger of the larger type and are so deep that I am unable to get to them so far..  I'm going to have to visit a doctor for these most likely...  Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another thing this company makes...  If you had gone through what I have (and still am), I can assure you that you'd be there with me...  Worst experience in my life with a product..  If I was the lawsuit type, they would have one....  (& if this doesn't end soon, they may still)  BUYER BEWARE.....  Don't say you weren't warned....	-1
CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again	-1
camw with a short in the wire.i have to tape it up to use it	-1
I don't know what the problem is. I just went through 2 high E strings in less than a month. I ordered this pack and gave a set to my friend. I kept 2 for my self thinking they would last me,but the high E quickly broke off...the first time could've been my fault I guess, I was trying to stretch the string out but it broke off. the second time I was just retuning. since I do do that a lot. I go from standard sometimes all the way down to B..As I was dropping the string, it just broke off. i've used nothing but Ernie Ball slinky's since I first began playing guitar and those are the strings that i've pretty much stuck to. They have never broken this quickly ever.  I don't know if it's the quality of the d'addario's or my guitar has some bridge issues.. But I have never had strings break off on me so easily...Since Amazon is only offering Slinky's as add on items I went with these even though I had never used a set ....Maybe I was wrong to try a different brand I had never used..  UPDATE: I was contacted by the company and they were able to solve my issue. I think I may have gotten some old sets,i'm not quite sure,but the year on the box was 2007,i'm not sure if that was the year the strings were made or just a random date on the box. But the company helped out and everything is good now :)	-1
This power supply is Junk only lasted 1 hour of use. The power supply got so hot it melted the outer casing .I would NOT recommend this power supply and seller. I am glad that i checked the supply. I could have caused a FIRE.The customer service was not helpful !	-1
The power adapter quit working after one day and Im not sure why. My Behringer adapter works much better so consider buying a different brand power source	-1
I managed to get through one night at a gig with these strings. I have been playing for 50 years and have used many D'addario strings and other products. These strings will not play in tune( and yes i did the intonation)!!	-1
VERY disappointed with this mic.  There are so many out there that are far better.	-1
Frankly I did not like the design of the dispenser. Prefer vacuum packed strings. I have six guitars, I change my guitar strings simultaneously each month. I think in this case comes to damaging moisture easily release them the ropes yet. Dispenser design really bad, hard to pull some strings that's not good, it hurts, buy this package by mistake, I'm sorry	-1
After putting the strings on the guitar I noticed that 3rd string had a different tint from other 5 strings. Also it's thickness was nearly identical to the second string and sound it made was somehow out of place.  Other 5 strings were in perfect condition but I ordered a set of 6 and expected to receive them all in a decent condition. I am disappointed, thus 1 star.	-1
Ive owned dozens of mics. I waned to like this mic. I wanted to like all the mics ive bought. This mic is bogged down and cottony sounding. Id rather use a sm58 because I wouldnt use this for broadcasting thats for sure. Id rather use a re20 which has more top end and is less colored and bogged down sounding. I even prefer my at2020usb over this mic. I just hope to god its good for screamers cause its not very good for anything else besides background noise cancellation and eating up gain.	-1
Having used D'Addario happily (as well as other brands) over the years, I felt a bit pissed off when, several weeks after purchasing these, I opened them and saw that they had a lot of corrosion.  I like the enviromentally friendly packaging, but it may have not worked this time. Or else they may need some QC.	-1
I have played on D'addario Before,  actually the first string I started out on. Super light's are ok,  but can wear out real fast,  So, It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's,  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings,  I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's,  cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.  Personally,  I don't like D'addario's at all,  I find the tone to bright.	-1
one of the sticks actually broke after the 4th jam	-1
Didn't come with the advertised BRL connector. Otherwise, I'm sure it's fine as a normal power adaptor.	-1
it will power some of my pedals. it didn't work with a Pyle Po Wah or a Danelectro Metal.	-1
I guess you get what you pay for. Does its job. Cord is 2-3 feet, but feels brittle and flimsy. Spend a little more and get a better made one. Cheers	-1
This item work for a week and then it stop working properly. It could have been the exception, I only want to share my experience.	-1
I had a Boss NS-2 and it works much better then M135.  I use strat with CS-3 and overdrive.  The NS-2 totally cut out the hiss and noise.  But this only cut out a little hiss, even I turned everything to the top.	-1
I though this was the case with the molded sides, but this has soft sides. Saxophones are too delicate to put in a case with flexible sides. I didn't realize it until too late to return and don't want to sell it and contribute to the detriment of someone else's horn. Very disappointed with description of this case. Stuck with two underwhelming soft cases and keeping MY horn it its original box.	-1
I Installed this unit in a local church on Jan 10, 2015. I was called back because one channel had a very low output. After cable testing all the cables, I noticed that there was a strong electrical smell coming from the unit and then it stopped working. Fortunately I was there to make sure that it was unplugged from the power. This is actually the third Behringer unit that the power transformer inside has burnt. It is not rated correctly for the power requirements of the unit. I have never had any problems with any other Behringer equipment, Just the EQ's.	-1
I did not expect that the device runs on 120 -volt electricity Alas and non-transferable to a 220 -volt electricity	-1
uncomfortable, to much work to adjust...buy a roc and soc...i have one for my dw kit..bought this for my Kat3...  sorry i did	-1
I've had this for a about more than a year, and it still works, but the height adjustment got wrecked after two months, not that comfortable (typical throne), and not for heavy guys. If you want to buy this go for it, for me, I'd rather save money on a professional throne like a Roc n Soc, it's worth it	-1
My friend and jam mate bought one of these and yes, It works, sort of, to eliminating some hum, but it cuts the volume too much and sucks some of the life out of your guitar tone.  For a little more money, why would you not buy an ISP Decimator 2?  They work much better at removing hum and keep your guitar tone in all it's glory.  I would image it could be used for other applications, but I would advise against using this for guitar/amp.	-1
ummm....supposed to remove hum.  not make it worse.  I've tried it in two locations and both channels and noise just gets worse.  Will try it with a few different setups and see what happens.  Might return it as i noticed that two of the screws look like a screwdriver has chewed up the head a little bit.  wondering if this is a refurb or something....I've heard of others complaining of the same thing.  Was really hoping this was the magic bullet to kill the hum.  not happy right now.	-1
I play at a church that has colored lights and my amp buzzes quite loudly.  I tried the Ebtech and the only thing it did was cut my volume in half...the hum and buzz was still there.	-1
I bought this base on the five star review but overall I'm not satisfied. I have to turn it every moment to be tight and it keep becoming loosen in seconds.	-1
Just assembly for a try, only few rolls with music, it's had some hole on head, that's mean bad quality. buyer beware for this kind of.	-1
The features all work except the headphone jack - if I plug my headphones all the way in, it only plays in one ear (never had a problem with this on any other players with the same headphones).  I had to keep it partially plugged out but since I like to keep the metronome on my bass drum (so it's within easy reach), playing frequently knocks the plug off.  I remember having this problem when the first portable cassette players came out in the 70's but this is now a new millennium and this should no longer be a problem.  Even with headphones (and I have isolation headphones) and the volume cranked to the max, I still had problems hearing it.	-1
Save your money get the pyle pro PDMK 7 mic kit its $125 has 7 mics which includes 2 condenser mics and works just as good as the over priced shures if you really need a SM57 type mic get the GLS ES-57 they are only $30 to $35 instead of $99 i own these mics myself snd use them while recording our own songs as well as clients in my studio don't pay for the shure hype and advertising	-1
Manhasset MH10001 Stand Lamp  Pros:  - Wide and strong frame blocks the light from the audience.  - Standard music folder fits on music shelf with this light attached.  - Accepts a wide variety of incandescent bulbs, such as tubular showcase bulbs from 20 to 60 watts, or the small-bodied compact florescent bulbs such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Feit-Electric-ESL13T-D-13-Watt-Compact-Fluorescent-Mini-Twist-Bulb-60-Watt-Incandescent-Equivalent-Daylight/dp/B000LWMSG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Feit Electric ESL13T/D 13-Watt Compact Fluorescent Mini Twist Bulb (60-Watt Incandescent Equivalent), Daylight</a>.  - Not expensive.  Cons:  - This lamp is not adjustable in any way, and the factory-set angle is inexplicably aimed at the upper part of the music shelf .  Using a 60-watt tube light helps, but the bottom part of the music still isn't well lit.  I got stuck using this lamp on a gig once, and wound up bending the lamp's sheet metal frame by hand to redirect more light onto the lower half of the music.  If you don't mind bending your own lamp, the light will then be OK.  - It doesn't fold, so it takes up too much space in a gig bag - assuming you carry it with you.  - Only fits metal stands without a rolled steel top, such as the Manhasset.  So, if you take it with you to a gig that has non-Manhasset-type stands, it won't fit.  Summary:  Manhasset should make this product with an adjustable lamp angle.  At the very least, the light should be redirected to the middle of the music shelf.	-1
I've been trying out lots of different harmonicas recently, which has given me a great opportunity to compare them all.  This Special 20 was the first I tried.  I found it perfectly fine at first, until I started trying other models.  Now, I find it to be very "stiff", and some notes are difficult to play, but are easy on other harmonicas.  Also, notes seem to get stuck more easily.  I wouldn't recommend this one.	-1
I did not like Grover 3277 Rhythm Stick Pair with One Plain and One Fluted I was not happy with them at all.	-1
I just pulled it out of the box and was surprised at how flimsy the product is. I'll hold on to it and see how it holds up.	-1
First and foremost I want to say that I bought this hi hat stand from Guitar Center. I did not buy it from Amazon. But I can say that it was promptly returned the very next day due to its inability to function properly. The pedal is held by a flimsy little squeeze piece of metal in which couldn't stay on to save its life. Every two pumps of the hi hat pedal that metal piece would fall off and the pedal would start hopping all over the floor. It was a cheap piece of junk. Unless you are a child and going to break this piece of equipment do not get it. Its not worth the $53 that they're selling it for. Spend the extra 20 and go for the next series up.	-1
It doesn't do anything.  I wish I had complained and sent it back soon enough.	-1
Its burnt after 3 months of use. It did not stop the noise either.	-1
I was very disappointed, this hi hat came with a bad clutch new right out of the box. I bought this to use in our recording studio, fortunately Amazon took care of my return fast so we did not miss any sessions.  If I had this to do over I would have bought the REAL DW hi hat stand in the first place, it costs more, there's a reason.  Good music to all!	-1
Over priced and didn't do what I wanted it to do	-1
this particular item did none of what it promised, I was so disappointed that I didn't even want to take the time to return it. I had an annoying humming in my computer to mix board connection, and when I unplugged the power cord to my computer; the hum went away, so I thought that this item would be just what I needed in order to get the crisp sound I desired for my online radio show.  I purchased it, it arrived, I plugged it in, and the humming remains. There is a disclaimer on the package that states that we should call the company before returning the item, but I don't need a "walk through" of how to plug in to an outlet.  I may call the company after my disappointment subsides, but I really wanted this to work.	-1
This product sucks! The hum noise got even louder and I had to take it out in the middle of the gig!	-1
Ridiculous price.  You can easily build one of these things for under 10 bucks.  Why do these companies shaft their customers?  Easy answer, greed.	-1
This makes zero difference. I have tried it in several applications.	-1
not dark enough	-1
More hiss than tone sculpting. Not really into this pedal ive had it for a few months prolly get rid of it	-1
It's non standard power supply is a pain in the azz. Cannot use in other countries. I hate devices with awkward power inputs. Other then that, works great.	-1
Flawed and insecure. The mechanism of affixing the contraption to the regular stand is extremely fragile as it relies on a narrow yet long friction-compressed green plastic cylinder that flexes inordinately should one try to rotate the whole works around the stand.  Under sufficient rotation, the contraption can FALL OFF the stand, carrying the microphone with it.  The only way I could make it work securely was to use TWO of these contraptions and interlock (as in a handshake) their boom mounting hardware.  Even then, they would quite easily turn around the stand but would not fall off, as they prevent each other from falling.  Rotation along one axis is controlled by an intermeshed cogwheel pair.  In the other axis, rotation is controlled by friction - which is often not sufficient.  The length of the 5/8" screw on the extension pole is too short and I had to replace it with a thinner standard star washer.	-1
No phantom power, and 2 of the inputs are slaved to the left/right channels.  It doesn't work well as a drum mixer, which is what I purchased it for.  I'll use it for overflow channels when I run out available channels on the stage.	-1
Unit arrived DOA.  Behringer has a bad reputation for quality.  So far I'm 0 for 2 on Behringer products.  Avoid.	-1
Its funny that, as I write this, there are 2 5-star reviews and 1 1-star. I don't think its as good as the 5-star reviews let on nor as bad as the 1-star. Yes, it is loud -- louder than the Firth and other pads that are wood or composite bases with a rubber pad on them -- those have little or no sound, unless they have BBs or other objects designed to mimic a snare sound like the Pro-mark X-pad. On the other hand, this pad is about the same or a little quieter than the Firth stock pad and slimpad -- ones designed to mimic the feel of a marching snare.  I own several pads, including this one. This Remo pad is the one I don't use. This would be a better pad if it were still built as it was in the '70s -- more or less the top of a snare drum with padding under the head. The older ones had metal rather than plastic rims and was tunable with drum keys rather than a screwdriver. If you can find a cheap one used, get it. Its size and light weight are a big plus. Throw it in a backpack with some sticks and you can practice on the road. But make sure you are all by yourself or in another part of the house.	-1
Complete garbage. What little it did little to enhance the guitar sound was completely drowned out by the amount of noise it added to the signal. Returned it.	-1
I've owned a lot of guitar stands over the years.  I've always liked On Stage mic stands, so this caught my attention.  Reviews seemed good, price was right, so I gave it a shot.  Wrong choice...  First of all, the stance on this stand is very narrow.  How I didn't notice that in the photos, I am not sure.  Holding a guitar, it does not seem stable, at all.  If I'm using a guitar stand, it has to be stable, period.  Second, I'm not sure who thought the design of this locking retainer was a good idea.  There is nothing natural about trying to get a guitar out of this stand.  It takes BOTH hands, and you cannot do it quickly.  Compared to my Hercules and Ultimate stands, this thing just does not measure up at all.  Save your time and money... get one of those...	-1
I found that the note attack was crap unless I kept the compression all the way down. In the end I sold the pedal within a month of purchase. The Joyo compressor might be a better option to maximize your control.	-1
The stand is as sturdy as any I have ever used.  I mean this thing is built!  But the pad, not good.  I love Remo and have used their heads for 40 years but this pad has NO response.  Its like playing on a wet sponge.  No matter how I tune it, sticks just won't bounce.  I was so excited to get this one but my expectations fell flat.	-1
'didn't do it for me,, it crushed the tone unless you really pushed it onthe volume. I was looking for a pedal that drooped some highs and tightened the lows with a thicker mid,, not there.  Iguess I was looking in the wrong place,, didn't need another overdrive	-1
too noisy to use, I wanted to retire my 1978 model for this....Dunlop just can't get this right like my old one.	-1
I like MXR pedals (their Carbon Copy is one of my favorite pedals ever) so I was really disappointed with this one.  What's the opposite of presence?  Bland?  Uninspired?  Whatever that adjective is, that's how I would describe what this pedal did for my sound.  I tried every setting and just couldn't find one that sounded even remotely good.  I have an Orange Squeezer clone so it's not that I don't like compression.  My Orange is a little noisy so I wanted to see if this newer compressor was quieter but it was a tone killer.  Everything came out bland.	-1
I hate it. I'd bought two, too! They topple over, scratch the guitars, and just overall make me angry. Yes, they are sturdy at this price point. I just don't like them.	-1
Sorry folks, but this ain't a Dyna-Comp by any stretch.  My mistake was thinking that this unit would be but a little more control.  The attack control on this thing goes from full-squash to almost nothing.  Unfortunately, besides compressing the daylights out of the signal, it adds some very unpleasant distortion as well - not what it's suppose to do at all.  I should have saved my money for a Keely.	-1
yes you can tweak it so its less, but you have to cut back on the distortion level to do so. so then why have a distortion pedal? pushed all the way for maximum distortion and volume the hiss makes this pedal unusable for recording. a gate won't do the trick because it will hiss regardless if your playing. really dissapointing pedal from mxr. their phase 90 sounds great, this thing is crap.	-1
First: The pedal does not sound in any way equal to what it shows in his video demo dunlop, its gain is much lower. If you are buying it because you like what the demo shows don't buy it. Second: When you turn the pedal on it softens the sound, like if you were in a hole which is completely undesirable.	-1
If you're looking at this, you're probably like me in that you were willing to pay more than to just get the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Behringer-Tube-Ultragain-MIC100-Audiophile-Vacuum-Tube-Preamplifier-with-Limiter/dp/B000CZ0RME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Behringer Tube Ultragain MIC100 Audiophile Vacuum Tube Preamplifier with Limiter</a>, but you still didn't want something too expensive. Well, sadly, I learned that this thing just isn't that great. The construction is shoddy. While it is all metal, there is a flimsiness to it that makes me a little uncomfortable with the thing. Mine also had some nice chips off the metal flake paint. Tone-wise, I certainly wasn't impressed. I took a look at the tube and saw some seriously bad craftsmanship. Yeah, I could replace it I suppose. Too bad my care for this thing is at a minimum. Funnily enough, the tube never lights up. They put a little light in there to make you think it does (lol). In truth, these "tube" budget preamps aren't truly what you'd think of as tube. It's a gimmick, and a poorly implemented one. "Neutral" appears to be the only setting appropriate no matter what you're using it for, which makes the other options useless. And trust me, they sound awful. I decided to just get another "budget" model, the VTB1, on eBay used. You pay for the quality of an item, of course. It can combine solid state and tube together, or have each separately. It can also function as a D.I. for bass. Um, much more useful, don't you think? No, I didn't expect the Behringer to have high marks, but this brand is disrespected in the recording community for a reason: it's just not that good. I returned mine.	-1
It's really bad distortion.  More like static that a warm distorted sound, to such a degree it gave me pause.  Then I began to think about why distortion would even sound pleasant.  I mean, you're intentionally corrupting a signal source, right?  Anyway, I'm anxious to replace the tube.  I've run keyboard, vocals, and guitar through it and I personally think it just sounds rotten.  My personal standard for tube greatness is the creamy Fender Hotrod Deluxe.  I understand it's not an apples-to-apple comparison ($800 amp vs. $50 toy) but it's just my experience - not gospel.  I got it used for $20 so I have little invested in this.  I'll have fun tinkering with it.	-1
for 50 bucks, it wasn't bad. I used it and loved it. unfortunately it shorted out and fried the board inside. I popped it open to try and see if I could fix it or resolder or anything, but no dice -- it was nice and toasted. not sure what happened, I always used a power conditioner and never did anything crazy with it. I am disappointed because it could have caught fire or damaged my other equipment if the case wasn't made as well as it is. for being such a useful device, why did it have to fry itself? I will buy another brand next time as well as steer away from all behringer products. if their preamp nearly caught fire, I don't wish to test their build quality on any other device.	-1
I bought this to help the sound of a Shure SM-57 mic.  There were some improvements, and it more or less did what I expected of it, though nothing remarkable.  However, I recently hooked it up to do some recording and found that it has become a serious noise source.  I've never dropped it, just maybe shuffled it around a bit with some other equipment.  It *looks* fine, but is now unusable because of the noise.  (I traced the noise to the unit by trying different cables and inputs and amps.)  Find something more solid.	-1
I've been trying to find a decent A/B switch for awhile to switch between my tube amp and pod rig. Unfortunately, this one did not fit the bill. The switches are too close together, and worse, whichever channel is off still gets signal from the other channel - it bleeds. It does not seem to suck tone at least, even when both channels are on ('Y' mode) but if you use this for 'A' OR 'B' the off channel will get signal bleed. So in my case, when my clean pod is ON (A is selected), the distorted amp which should be OFF (B) but still bleeds through, ruining the clean tone. Also, no 9v adapter - had to use a battery eliminator cable(not included). Fed up with these lousy A/B products - ordered a loop master.	-1
I have gotten other value stands but this is the thinnest and most wobbly stand ever. Its good for say a splash, it sways all over the place with a 16 inch crash. Even with the base spread out as much as possible.	-1
The stand I received was not what I expected at all! The upper tube fit crooked, instead of straight, which just seems to be  a  design flaw  in  the joint fitting. The tilter also leaves a lot  to be desired. It couldn't support a heavy 21" ride cymbal without having to really apply a lot of torque to the nut. I personally wish they'd ditch this stand & bring back the 900 series which is a far superior "heavy duty" stand IMHO.	-1
Not a very good/sturdy boom stand. I read a few reviews before I bought it because it sounded reasonably stable/sturdy. Spend the extra money and by the high end Pearl stands.	-1
As a professional drummer, these are Not good stands.  If you play in your garage, and don't break them down, trap case them, set up, break down, again, continue, they may be ok.  They are Wobbly, with an 18' cymbal that you are hitting hard, worse, the cheap/junk rivets come out, with causes the stand to spin, and simply come apart.  I had to duct tape 2 of these to finish a couple of gigs.  I threw these stands away, sold the good ones, and purchased stands that can stand up to even light break down, and set up, without falling apart. Good for a beginner, junk of you gig. I Don't recommend these light weight cheaply made stands.	-1
sent it back, not strong enough	-1
Cheap..  in every aspect of the word...	-1
One word, FLIMSY.	-1
Thought I would need this to supplement a beginner xylophone that I bought.  The Xylo had better mallets included with it, so really this purchase was not necessary for me.  Unfortunately, when you buy a  Xylo this is one of items that comes up as a suggested add on. In essence, I was duped.	-1
Crap! Broke within days.	-1
basically toys	-1

It was barely used because it sounded awful!  It was to be used by a professional musician. We recently had a professional sound man check the mic and he feels that it is a defective unit because it doesn't work as it is supposed to in regards to the signal.  Unfortunately we found this out over a year after purchasing it and we did not purchase the warranty.  It was NEVER used during a performance and only tried out in practice and during sound check.  I would like to exchange it if possible.	-1
returned	-1
I was so happy to receive this audio headset microphone and for the price you cant beat it. but i had plug it to my pa system pwma8601 and the output to the mic. does not work, you cant barely hear your voice. i don't know if i have to add something to it but the voice is very low.	-1
This may be adequate for speeches, lectures and such, with careful placement. But it's really not adequate for singing. The sound is thin and tinny (ie. no low end). And it's very sensitive to plosives, making positioning very tricky. The headband is so uncomfortable, that I got a headache after 1/2 hour or so. (I ended up waring it around my neck.) The cord is so short, you'll definitely need an extension. All in all, there's not much to recommend this thing.	-1
for me this sucked big time, if you want noise this is it. loud and ugly too	-1
Absolutely hands down without question or worth any debate in my mind the worst cymbal I have ever heard in my life.  My daughters toy cymbals sound better than this.  I know some people love these things but mine was terrible.  I even gave it to a friend and he gave it back to me with a similar sentiment.	-1
good sounding..but it is too high pitched..save your money and get a bigger one	-1
I rate this two stars only because I knew it would be bad when I bought it.  What should I expect for that price?  It somehow managed to be ever worse than I expected.  I think they just bank on people like me thinking "How bad could it possibly be? Its so cheap, why not?"  Don't.	-1
It's a good slide, but I prefer the Medium size. It fits perfectly on my little finger which is the finger I wear it on. Amazon doesn't carry the Medium size, so I got one from Music 123 (they carry all of the sizes). I also tried the small one , but that was too small.  I love the clay interior, it's very comfortable. And the glaze on the outside produces very warm, buttery tones.	-1
I purchased this Dunlop "Moonshine" slide at the same time as ordering the Dunlop model 224 Heavy wall brass slide also size medium...NEITHER of these Two slides are a Medium size. I have slides from many makers that fit my Pinky perfectly and they are size Medium. I now own TWO USELESS Dunlop slides...How two mediums from the same maker can be different is totally REDICULOUS and lousy business practice. Buy Rock Slide for the best or Imperial Valley.... I'm Disgusted	-1
Very nice looking. I am 6 ft. tall with average hands. I generally order a small slide for my pinky. Ordered a medium after reading reviews saying it ran small. Didn't come close to fitting on my pinky. Slid halfway on and 2nd knuckle stopped it cold. I really liked it. I wanted it to work. I am going to send back and order the large. That might fit my pinky, but if they all run small I am doubting it would fit my middle finger.  Otherwise it appears very nice. Like a Maserati with no engine, however.	-1
Ordered the large and it still barely fit my pinky.	-1
Fuzzy harsh fatigue	-1
It gives a strange scratchy sound on the strings. I'm not sure if I just made the wrong choice with a ceramic slide but it makes a hideous scratchy noise.	-1
Fits too tight for me, and is too long. I prefer the shorter 218 or 220 models in glass or metal, and just wanted to try something different. Will probably give this away. If you have LONG and skinny fingers, this might be a good fit.	-1
I think it's a cool slide, but unfortunately I can't use it. The sizing is WAY off. The large is still quite small. I can only get it on my pinkie if I really coax it over the knuckle. Useless for me since I play slide with my ring finger - which it'll never fit over.	-1
Stated to be a "Large" slide. It is very well made but have to use little finger and not index as slide diameter very "small".	-1
I got a Jim Dunlop glass slide that was large and fit great, so I figured this one would fit also.  Nope wouldn't even get up to the knuckle on my ring finger.	-1
I was not satisfied with this product.  The sound and quality are poor for the price.	-1
I was skeptical of a plastic harmonica, but there were so many good reviews, that I thought I should try it. I reasoned that if it played really nice, I could live with the fact that it's an ugly chunk of plastic.  Well...  Yes, it does come apart super fast and easy without any tools, but aside from that, there is nothing about this thing that impresses (or even satisfies) me.  1. Maybe some are airtight, by mine sure wasn't.  The design prevents any external air leaks, but it still leaks internally (a leak is a leak). 2. The mouthpiece is really thick - like having a big bar of soap in your mouth. Tone is subjective so some might like it, but I hate it - really dull sounding. When you blow through the comb and reed-plates alone, it sounds better, so I think it's that big plastic body that takes all the life out of the tone. 3. Did I mention that it's one big, thick piece of plastic?  UPDATE: Just got a new Seydel Saxony.  Well, compared to the Saxony, the CX12 seems like one of the "prizes" that you'd win for knocking over a bottle at a carnival. The Saxony is nearly twice as much, but it looks, feels, and plays like it cost 20 times as much!  UPDATE 3/16/14:  It's now a year later, and I still LOVE my Seydel Saxony.  Instead of continuously upgrading, just buy the Saxony and be done with it.	-1
I bought this product in order to dry out my Selmer tenor saxophone. I carefully researched all of the available sax swabs out there and decided to purchase the Hodge product based on numerous highly positive recommendations appearing on the major internet saxophone forums. When I received it I couldn't believe how small the piece of silk is. I should have realized there would be a problem with it because Hodge was advertising it as a swab that can be used to swab out the instrument without taking the neck off. In order to achieve this the silk material is too small. It is superb for just the neck but for the rest of the instrument it is totally inadequate, I am now looking for a "beefier" swab that I can use for the main body of the instrument. The plastic coated weight is very nice by the way. I will keep it for just swabbing the neck which it does very nicely.	-1
I was practicing jazz ride cymbal patterns on a Zildjian 20" medium ride, and after 1 hour with these new sticks the tip cracked. Then it doesn't sound the same. I loved the sound until the wood came apart in the grain.	-1
My fault for not catching this before the order, but if you have gorilla hands these are the sticks for you. Not for me. Used once (for a few minutes)...sticks are giant and wicked heavy. Too much trouble to sell on eBay. Will never use again...now I know :-)	-1
I bought it because it look nice but actually nothing is better and special about this stick and it even slip. So why pay over ten dollars and get the same quality.	-1
Sounds terrible. Clashes so hard against all other sounds in my kit. I know a China should be "white-noisey" and kinda "dirty" sounding ... but this makes more of a CLUNK sound.... If you go in the trash and pull out ANYTHING made of metal, and hit it with a drum stick, it will sound AS GOOD if not BETTER than this cymbal. Even for the super low price, it's junk.	-1
A cheap Chinese trash cymbal.  A good addition to a big set of drums, but cannot be used as a ride or crash cymbal per se.  It's a single stamped piece of brass/bronze/? material, that sounds like it's from the soundtrack of a Charlie Chan movie.  I set it under a 10" Zildjian splash cymbal, so the smaller cymbal hits it.  Most drum sets don't need this cymbal, unless you are like me and collect percussion instruments.  It really has no special sound.	-1
For this price, I couldn't expect anything better. I am not a huge fan of the china sound in general and this one is particularly ugly. Depending on the style of playing, it could fit in really well, but I don't play anything that requires a lot/any china at all, just wanted to experiment with the sound. I would recommend getting a better quality china if you were serious about incorporating this type of sound into your playing.	-1
Not only did both of these I received have non functioning notes but the pitch on the lower notes was questionable. I ended up buyin cheaper ones that were better	-1
The last drummer who played the USA Ludwig kit I my studio used a set of the black paint Vic Firth Steve Gadd signature stick and left black paint marks all over my white coated drum heads as black paint flecks all over. Luckily I already knew that a tiny bit Magic Eraser removes things like that from those drum heads.  As you can see from pictures the drummer has pretty good technique as there are no cracks on the sticks. If the stick didn't have paint on them I would give them five stars as every type of Vic Firth stick I've used has been excellent.	-1
not what I was used to it!!	-1
Bought this ligature to try with my Vandoren M15 mouthpiece. I did have improvement in ease of play of the upper register, but decrease in the mid. I play with it every day for 2 weeks but it never seemed to conform to the mouthpiece. I returned it, which was so easy, and replaced it with a Vandoren ligature that is working out great.	-1
ligature not large enough to come down nicely on the mouthpiece over a reed	-1
Poor product	-1
Rovner ligatures are overrated. They don't brighten the sound as well as Vandorens. I just think these are not worth it. It does make life a bit easier because there is only one tightener, but it's not worth losing your sound.	-1
Very cheaply made.  Arrived bent.	-1
I was prepared for this mouthpiece to not fit perfectly because an earlier reviewer mentioned it. And it would not fit most of my barrels. Finally I found an old barrel in my box marked "Old Barrels", that had a slightly narrower inside diameter. So after 5 minutes of sanding the cork on the Yamaha, I was able to accomplish a snug fit, albeit with a plethora of cork grease. I tried it out and it whistled too much. I took the ligature and the reed from a different clarinet and affixed them to the new Yamaha and it still whistled like the 4:55 Canonball Express out of Hooterville. Then I went to a third clarinet, added a brand new reed and a different ligature and, still, whistling galore.  It now resides in the box "Unusable Mouthpieces".  The reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 0 is because I estimate that there is a 40% chance that the failing is me and my mouth and not the Yamaha.	-1
I was hoping this would be like the microfiber silk cloths that came with both of my DiMedici flutes but other than being silk there is nothing similar.  This cloth mostly just moves the moisture around as it it not absorbent.	-1
I've actually heard better sounding farts than this atrocity ..	-1
I have played guitar for quite a few years and have played and owned countless pedals and can honestly tell you this pedal is a complete piece of junk.  Upon looking at it you will first notice there is no "Distortion" or "Gain" knob to actually control the amount of distortion this distortion pedal produces.  This means it makes one sound and you get a 3 band EQ and volume knob, that's it.  That alone should be a deal breaker for most.  Now I admit this lack of control and versatility could be redeemed through a fantastic tone, but you will find no such quality here.  Do not buy this pedal, spend a little bit more on a different pedal or purchase a different pedal second hand for about the same cost as this heap.  Save yourself from future disappointment and regret.	-1
Nice lightweight case that fits vintage buescher sax and mouthpiece. Only complaint is that the Inside place for neck is too narrow and does not hold the neck of the sax. Returned the case.	-1
I agree, it's not very absorbent. I had been using a strip of nylon I got at a fabric store and this silk isn't anywhere near as absorbent as that nylon was. I went back to the nylon.	-1
Everybody knows that the purpose of playing clarinet is to waste money on reeds.  That is what I did with these.  I forgot (just spaced it when I ordered these I guess) that Mitchell Lurie has  "premium" reeds that comes five in a box, so I kind of accidentally ordered these regular ones.  Although the premiums can be great, and I have ordered more of them now, these "regular" reeds are disappointing.  For $18-something a box of 10, I at least expect to have the cuts fairly even.  Half of this box had bark way up the right side, (by way up, I mean higher than the left side, very, very uneven cut, ) it looked like the machine was set wrong and they packaged the reeds anyway.  You can kind of see this unevenness in the photo.  One even came with a chip already in it!  (First one in the photo).  They are terrible.  I wish I could say something different, but I have been cheated out of $18 and had to turn around and spend MORE money on three boxes of premiums.  Such is life.  I imagine I will be able to use 4 or 5 of these after my break-in process, but I am already looking forward to getting the premiums, because these are life-less in comparison.  Just my opinion. By the way, all around I like Mitchell Lurie reeds.  I played them throughout my college clarinet career and beyond (that was years ago).  I always found them to be more "mellow" than Vandoren reeds and actually still find that to be the case.  But I will stick to ML Premiums now!	-1
Obviously the item shipped to me was wired incorrectly and they don't make them ALL like this- or else the other reviews would be bad.  The pedal shipped to me has crossed wires.  With no pedal pressed, the sustain is ON, with the pedal pressed, the sustain is OFF.  Totally backwards.  I am mostly annoyed because i got the super(slow)saver shipping and waited two weeks to get a crappy pedal that i have to ship back- and then wait another few weeks.  Yay.	-1
Sorry didn't last a month !!! not good quality at all !!  couldn't hold my MXL studio mic clamp broke due to bad design and part made with cheap materials IMO !!	-1
Very flimsy, the white cover is all faded and come part on surface... I wanted a RFEAL one and couldn't get one just these cheap knock offs. NOT worth the money!	-1
The unit that I got, Made in Pakistan, was nothing more that a tourist trinket or childs toy. 4 Stars for a toy. Dull Sound. Floppy head. No tone to skin, jingles flat and clinky. Wood marred, poorly joined.	-1
I thought these were regular sticks and not marching sticks - i guess I didn't see the corpsmaster part of the title, either way, expect a big, thick, heavy marching drum stick.  I ended up not using these that much because I prefer the white vic firth marching sticks over these.  The balance wasn't as comfortable as the white ones that vic firth sells and the brown color wasn't really appealing.  The bead is shaped a little oddly - not something I prefer to play with, but keep in mind this is just my preference.  I wouldn't recommend these, but I wanna also say i was sad that these weren't what I thought they were and now they are sitting in my stick bag collecting dust.  You cannot play drum set with these!!! You cannot play percussion with these!!!  if you do you will break or damage the drum/drumhead.  These are strictly for marching band snare drum use, and if you want sticks for that purpose, I would recommend the white ones and not these.  Also, for some reason they feel more slippery - maybe it's the coating? I dunno.  It's a quality made stick, I just don't have anything else positive to say about it.	-1
Purchased several. Some were dead on arrival. Others failed after a few months.	-1
The pedal works in reverse.  It sustains without pressing the pedal.  In order to stop the sustain, you press the pedal.  Exactly the OPPOSITE way a normal sustain pedal works.	-1
These are great headphones for what I do which is playing drums to my favorite music.  Very clear, tight fitting, etc..  However, my first pair went dead on me after a year so I ordered another pair thinking that maybe that was an aberration or something.  Low and behold, less than three months later the second pair left speaker went out too.  I have to find another studio grade headphone other than these.  Very unfortunate in terms of quality because I am a long time Vic Firth customer with sticks, DVD's, etc  UPDATE:  I emailed Vic Firth and they responded the next morning saying that they will send me a new pair!  Very good service and responsiveness!  Update:  12-1-17:  Vic Firth actually sent me a second (free for replacement) pair of these headphones because the first ones they sent me went dead on the left side AGAIN after just about 5 months.  I NOW HAVE FOUR PAIRS OF THESE HEADPHONES AND ALL OF THEM WENT DEAD ON THE LEFT EAR WITHIN A FEW MONTHS!  BEWARE!  I noticed many other reviewers with the same problem too!  I bought a pair of KAT headphones for drumming about a year ago and now they're starting to sputter!  They do isolate and sound very good though.	-1
I took a chance and bought because the description said it was compatible with most keyboards.  It did not work with mine... in fact, it did the opposite - not sustain, but shortened the tones and cut them off immediately - read other reviews that explained why this was and that many others had had similar issues, but still I was very disappointed.	-1
They are great. Totally sound isolating. Sound quality isn't the best, but we use them for our drummers at church and all of them love them.  Edit: May 1st 2014: not even 1 year later and one side went out. Now I gotta buy another pair and just hope they don't go out again. No cable breakage and everything looks fine. Just bad build quality.	-1
There's a helpful review that is titled "They break."  Believe me, they do. And OFTEN.  Been teaching drums for 8 years. Sometimes the headphones are tossed aside after a student's lesson.... or on the ground (though I give them crap about it). Still, it's not like they're thrown with force. In about a month, one ear will go, the headband will tear and subsequently allow the earpiece frames to flop all over and just not stay put, and, the black plastic frame piece will break right off of the earpiece, or any combination of these things.  I avoid these things like the plague. Get the CADs. They're twice as loud, too (literally).  I think the reason these isolate better is because they basically squeeze the head of the person wearing them... insanely tight. But that's the only positive about them. They seriously will fall apart. We've gone through about 15 pairs in 5 years... and still use the busted ones (gaff tape, etc) because we're just tired of buying them, knowing they will fall apart.	-1
I want my 2008 model Rhythm Tech tambourine to be brand new again!  It had a MUCH more comfortable handle and MUCH richer sound, too.  After so much gigging, it's showing wear, so I thought I'd replace it with another Rhythm Tech.  Unfortunately, I had to send this one back.....it sounds very cheap (more like Santa's sleigh bells than a true instrument) and also would have made my hand hurt.  The handle is wide where it should be more rounded, making for too open a grip.  And I have long fingers, too!  Sorry, this one's not for me.	-1
These reeds are great.... If you don't plan on using them. They produce a thin sound with zero support creating wasted air. Hemkes are cut very poorly and and not uniform at all. You'd be lucky to get 1 playable reed out of a box. If you are just starting out, spend the extra dough on some Vandorens or some Rico Reserves or Royals. The point is when it comes to reeds, the last thing you want to do is cheap out. After all, the reed is what makes the sound, the saxophone itself is just one big amplifier.	-1
i was looking for a replacement pedal for my Yamaha DD-55 drum machine. according to the Yamaha Corp. website, either the Yamaha FC4 or FC5 pedals will function for  the Hi-Hat/Pedal 2. but when i took it home and plugged it into the machine, it didn't work :(  however, i'll give it 2 stars since the pedal works beautifully with my Yamaha keyboard--as good as the one i already have, which only cost me $9.99. so i'm returning the FC4 while i continue to search for what i need. i realize the DD-55 is has been discontinued for a while, but i was quite disappointed to find misinformation on the Yamaha website about their products.	-1
These reeds are utter crap! I've used Rico #2 reeds for a number of years because of their ease of use and that you don't have to blow too hard for them to work correctly. I went through this entire 3 pack in one concert and a rehearsal a few day later.  The first reed made it through to the intermission of my concert and barely would work anymore. I changed it out during intermission to the second reed in the pack. Worked great for about 3 songs and then it too started not to work, and by the end of the concert was really difficult to blow through. A few days later I had a rehearsal so I tried using the 2nd reed from the 3 pack thinking I might have been tired towards the end of the concert. About 20 minutes into rehearsal the 2nd one died completely. So I changed to the 3rd reed from the pack. This one work for about an hour and then I could only get squeaks out of it. Ridiculous and frustrating!  Sure I've run into one every once in a while that was bad, but not all 3 from the same pack... maybe it was just a bad lot, but I'm not very happy. Now I have to order more before my next rehearsal. I'm sad to see that Amazon is endorsing reeds from this seller.	-1
Just a waste of my time.	-1
Completely useless junk!!!	-1
I suppose I could *learn* to use this, learn some licks to take advantage of it, etc., but I don't care for the thick velcro strap (I suppose I could try and change it?), and find the size both too big to be comfortable and too small to be useful in any more than a limited, or pre-planned, way.  I already lost it, also, and won't replace it.	-1
I have always found Ricos to be acceptable beginner reeds for students in their first year or two playing. The reeds are fairly consistent, and the lower price means that breaking a reed is not too much of an expense for whomever is footing the bill for reeds (teacher, student, school, parent...). The provided plastic cases do a good job protecting the reed, as long as they are not pushed in too far.  However, the number 2 is reed is quite soft in my opinion. I have always started my middle school students on 2 1/2s, and have had plenty of success. I would have students try making sound on a 2 1/2 first and then go down only if students really struggle making a sound.	-1
Bristles start to come loose and fall off with subsequent insert/retract. I've played it for less than a week total. I am a hobby player and so take the rest of comments as you may. Brush could be firmer and slightly heavier gauge. This is not appropriate for non-mic'd situation. The handle on my brush does not look like the one on the picture- shiny.. Rather, mine looks like old dull and weathered rubber and feels a bit tacky. I've been told you just have to play it before you buy it.	-1
Just a cheap recorder with a big bell! Don't bother purchasing if you or your child already owns a recorder. If you don't have a recorder and are still considering this, look at Yamahas instead. There are even precorders for easier learning (which are *still* better-made than this thing).	-1
Total piece of trash. Do not buy. It was not even good enough as a toy! It was not in tune! It was supposed to come with instructions. Mine didn't. It came in a crushed box.  Looked like I got a used piece of junk someone had returned!! The only reason I didn't return it was that it was cheap! I guess you can't expect much for $3.	-1
Two broke already - insides spilled everywhere. Wouldn't recommend it. Next time I will buy LP RHYTHMIX.	-1
I probably received a bad one. Rumor is Wuhan's quality control sucks so it's kinda iffy if your going to get a good one unless you personally get to test some before you buy. Which is what I suggest you do. I've heard Wuhan 16" chinas that sound much better than the one I have. The one I have sounds pretty much just terrible, I try to avoid hitting it and will be switching it out for a better cymbal soon.  Try to avoid buying these online. Find them at a local music store and test them out to find a good one otherwise you more than likely going to be disappointed.	-1
Please see in the above. I called Gemeihardt help for my new 5-year warrantied flute but no one at the store had replied  my  calls.	-1
This stand was a bummer.  Opened it up and was hoping to use it as a stand for my Korg Monotron Delay.  Basically what I found out was that this stand won't hold onto anything.  It can't clamp on to the microphone stand....so what's the point of it?  It's worthless.  I finally managed to clamp it on to one of my mic stands (I have 3 different ones, it didn't work with any) and then I barely put my finger on it.  Guess what happened?  That's right, it came crashing down onto the ground.  Right now it's sitting on the floor, buried behind who knows what, and I'll never use it again.  A very very bad product, surprised it's a quik lok product.	-1
Won't fit a standard mic stand! The wing screw is so short that it won't champ completely on a narrower stand! Very heavy and not supported well by the small clamp piece! JUNK!	-1
Tried this on both an Atlas and an On-stage brand mic stand.  Opening is too small to fit the bottom portion of the stand and much too large to fit the top half of the stand.  Can't tighten "Qucik-Lok" screw enough to get it to stay on top half.  Did a quick, not to great fix, by putting a small piece of slit garden hose around top of mic stand, and then placing this stand shelf's clamp around it and tightening.  Do NOT recommend purchase of this item.	-1
The design looks good, it has good quality and solid/strong built, the problem is that it is very heavy, the tray is actually heavier than what I was planning to use it for. if you use it in a microphone stand it is so heavy that it might cause the stand to tilt over. it would be good if it was made of a lighter metal. The design of the clamp is nice looking, but not very useful. I have a mixer stand and needed to use this tray to put a couple of little things on it under my mixer. The clamp doesn't fit on the mixer stand, so I cannot use it the way I was planning to. The clamp only fits in those cheap skinny microphone stands, or on the skinny extension portion of a standard microphone stand, it won't fit on a sheet music stand, so the clamp makes the use of this tray very limited, and the screw that is used to tighten the clamp is not protected so it will scratch and leave a mark on whatever stand you use attach it to.	-1
I purchased this tray for headphone and other small item storage in my vocal isolation booth. I covered with carpet to reduce reflection, and mounted it on a pipe that runs vertically from the floor to the ceiling. The tray is very sturdy and a great size, but the clamp has proven unusable. I have not been able to tighten it or set it up in a way that does not make the tray droopy and unstable. I ended up rigging another clamp solution (with generous use of duct tape), so I am all set now. But only two stars because the tray did not work for me as delivered.	-1
This pedal is an incredible volume pedal that works flawlessly...but only if you're playing on clean.  As a NWOAHM/Thrash guitar player I use a lot of very heavy distortion (high gain) and regular volume pedals just weren't able to tame the sound when I need it docile so I went on Musician's Friend, saw this and thought, "a volume pedal designed for high gain? I'm buying this." I have never been more disappointed in a pedal since I bought an Original CryBaby (compare it to a Morley Bad Horsie and you'll be disappointed in the CryBaby too).  I understand that for some, depending on the style, this pedal works admirably. But to the metal heads out there...DON'T BUY THIS!!! IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOUR THIRST FOR TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE SOUND (and sound level specifically)  Not only does it not adjust sound very well at all at high gain levels, the swelling/quelling of volume is completely flawed. It's as if the volume scale went from one to two to three to EIGHT with nothing in between leaving you with basically two possible volume levels: whisper quiet (it WILL NOT reduce the sound to zero. I guarantee), or full volume.  Do not buy this pedal. There are plenty of far better volume pedals, or you can do it the old fashioned way and change the volume on the guitar itself.	-1
This is a wonderful instrument as far as the acoustic aspect of it. However the electronics are very disappointing. The battery holder in mine is very difficult to open to replace the batteries. Also the tuner is a very poor excuse for one. Additionally ALL of the knobs are very loose and wobbly. I visited my local Guitar Center store and examined one of these there. It had the very same problems mine does. Epiphone is a very good company, however they certainly need to revamp the design of the electronics portion of this instrument.	-1
I've bought a guitar stand and a mic stand from OnStage, and they have served me well. From the knobs to the legs, this stand is simple and reliable. The assembly was easy. Nice product. The only issue was that one of the top tubes of the z leg was warped, and so the 2nd tier couldn't fit in. It was an obvious defect that even my untrained eye noticed as soon as I took it out of the box. Shouldn't they check the parts before shipping them out? I wrote them a polite e-mail describing the problem two weeks ago, and I'm still waiting for a reply. I can't buy a replacement leg anywhere, so my 2nd tier isn't worth jack squat. This company doesn't have its act together. I'm not buying their products anymore. If you buy a stand from them, be ready to take your chances.	-1
Not in love with the sound.	-1
Very disappointed in this product, especially since I believe they said it was the choice for studio playing!  I shook it a couple times and one end came loose, which caused the tiny beads inside to stick inside the rim.  I pried them out, pushed the lid back on as tightly as possible.  Today I tried it again and the lid popped right off, dumping a handful of beads on the floor.  I would think the lids on each end would have been sealed with something to prevent this.  Maybe a quality control issue.  Not sure if it's worth trying to return it. 4 frownie faces.	-1
Not subtle enough for me. Entire contents slide as a lump. I'm sure part of it is me. Would be fine if you needed hard definitive sound but not for slower quiet needs, My opinion of course.	-1
The round metal parts come off and go flying...	-1
This is one of the worst sounding tambourines I've played. It sounds like plastic hitting plastic. I got it for free, so I'll just give it to one of my little cousins or friends' kids.	-1
This stick is very big and not good at all... i bought this pack for my drummer... but he end up giving them to his friends	-1
The vast majority of harps I've bought have been A's, and that's the key I'd recommend to any beginner. I've owned two Lee Oskar A harmonicas. The first one was actually one of the first harmonicas I ever learned on, and I struggled a lot with it. After I became more accomplished, I bought a second Lee Oskar, but it only confirmed for me that these harmonicas are not for me.  Pros: 1) The construction quality on these things is second to none. Compared to these harmonicas, everything else will feel like a cheap toy. Even the cases they come with are rugged and snap together, as if built for professionals. 2) These harmonicas seem to be able to take a nearly unlimited amount of punishment in every form and keep going.  Cons: 1) The notes on these harps are just unbelievably hard to bend for me. I don't know whether I just got two duds or what, and maybe I need to adjust the reeds, because I haven't, but it takes a phenomenal amount of effort to get the reeds to do anything but play the note they were originally designed to play. 2) The case is horribly designed for the average person. Your lips either end up so far apart that you leak air at the edges of your embouchure, or end up pushing against the case rather than going over and around it like a normal harmonica. Basically, if you aren't familiar with harmonica playing, you will not have the tendency to "eat" the correct amount of your harmonica, which will work against your tone in the long run. 3) I honestly think the tone sucks. If you want a fat tone, this is not going to make you happy. It's a shame because everything about these harps will convince you that they're serious and will produce a huge fat tone with the oversized holes and huge reeds, but at the end of the day when you put it through an amplifier, it just doesn't sound good. This isn't to say these won't produce a lot of sound. These harps are freaking LOUD. But the quality of the tone just isn't there in my opinion.  My personal preference is the Hohner Special 20. I've played quite a few Hohners, and that harp produces the best tone for me. I would still encourage anyone looking to learn harmonica to purchase a Lee Oskar and a couple other harmonicas of the same key (this is important for comparison purposes) and see what works best for them. I have run into people that swear by Lee Oskars who are great players, and I believe that differences in throat construction and embouchure tendencies make buying harmonicas too complicated to recommend a single brand.	-1
Doesn't fit my stands	-1
I suppose these work as advertised, but there was no shaft length published with the description of this product when I bought them, and it turns out that I have no cymbal stands with threads long enough to accommodate them.	-1
did not fit my flt i ordered  wrong size	-1
wtf could also stand for "wasted the funds". What a waste of time and money. DOn't fit traditional stands. Don't know how such a super giant like Gibraletr could make a non-universal product. And it's kinda overpriced. There's more plastic in my kids happy meal toys. hmmm...	-1
Made a mistake on this purchase. Decided to save a little money over a high quality leather strap. The edge of this strap is very irritating on your neck. A bass can get heavy after a few hours, and this strap will scrape your neck until it is very red and irritated. Not a good design.	-1
i've had them for less than a week and they broke. probably because it is hickory	-1
Using with a Ludwig Breakbeats kit... Can't seem to keep the wingnuts steady so the height fluctuates regularly causing the bass drum to move. Rubber pad came off and had to be glued back on after 2 months. Just very low quality components involved here.	-1
Go to Walmart and buy a car you will get better quality	-1
Can't get intonation right have tried everything hang on wall it is pretty and I have set up my other guitars forever	-1
it sure didn't work for me	-1
Decent product, but would not buy again.  Minus 1 star - Product does NOT stay put on my hi-hat. The top piece has come undone many times in the last month. Minus 1 star - Product does not clamp down and hold hi-hat closed. If you are doing intricate work on the hi-hat, and attempt to do double bass work, you will be disappointed. Minus 1 star - Cheap cast parts. Feel like if I accidentally hit this, it will snap.	-1
I have not been successfully in using the Rovner tenor sax Ligature. There must be some profession tecnique that I am not aware.	-1
I bought 4 of these, 2 for light and 2 for heavy cymbals. I bought them without having had any experience - just some youtube videos. Unfortunately the mounting mechanism that attaches the spring to the stand totally ruins the thread of the cymbal holder - even after one tightening!!!! I am glad I used it on a cymbal stand that is old and not one of my newer ones!!!! I never used any of these!!!! I read the reviews that deny this.......	-1
After buying it quit working in less the 3 days. i tried everything to make it work. Sent it back for good!!!  i went out and bought a more expensive Wittner Metronome model #831 dark brown, made in Germany. Don't waste your hard earned music dollars. I paid $41.00 for Wittner and I love it!!! (5 stars) Get what you pay for here. Pay now or pay later..... ???	-1
Okay, maybe it's not fair of me to review the Qwik Time metronome because I got it free when I purchased a saxaphone (I didn't actually purchase the metronome).  The knob on mine won't turn to any setting other than 100bpm.  Other than that it seems okay.  It produces a tone at A440, clicks off 100 bpm or blinks a light at 100 bpm.  Does seem strange, since it's sold as a metronome, that no other tempo can be selected.  Short of that it works.   So, since I didn't have anything invested, I took it completely apart.  Battery out, circuit board out, arrow display decal glued to the center of the knob and sure enough, it is one molded piece with no ability to turn, EVER! I even took to it with a pair of pliers to be sure.  It's just a pretty picture that gives you the impression of select-ability. I'd be skeptical of any of their products now.  So I stand corrected.  It isn't a knob.  The arrows are buttons which you push to go up or down in tempo.  Sorry	-1
This bag is way too big for my 88 keyboard. Had to return it. I have a Yamaha MOXF8 and it was a lot more room left in the bag and my keyboard kept sliding back and forth.	-1
I couldn't DISagree with the other reviewers here more! This silly contraption might be the ticket if you're a drummer - I wouldn't know, because I'm no drummer, but if you're a banjo owner hoping to use this device to set the head tension on your banjo, save your time and money! Its an absolute joke! This thing ships with two adapters, both of which are completely useless for the 1/4" or 6-mm OD nuts on either American-made (SAE) or metric banjo J-hooks, so as soon as you receive it, you'll need to head-out to the hardware store or go on-line to locate another suitable adapter, and in all likelihood, you'll probably need to use a file or bench grinder to shave off some of the metal on that new adapter, just to make it work! Here's why . . . the diameter of the male shaft on both of the adapters provided with this lemon is 5.5 mm, and they both barely fit into the square female drive socket (or chuck), which means that the female drive socket on the device is approximately 5.8-6.0 mm in diameter. Thus, it will NOT accommodate a standard 1/4" adapter (1/4" = 6.4 mm.). This means that if you want to make it work on a banjo head, you'll need to locate either a 6 mm or 1/4" male socket adapter, and then grind-off all four edges of the drive shaft until it measures something less than 5.8 mm in total diameter. Absolutely ridiculous! Not this fool! I sent this lemon straight back. Good grief! How tough would it have been for these fine folks to have made the female drive 1/4" diameter??? Wake-up people!	-1
A good beginner guitar to play, fairly good construction of materials and for it`s large jumbo size, TONALITY-WISE, fair.	-1
this was bought for the Alesis Pad; however, did not fit and i returned it	-1

Looking back it appears that what is involved is a lack of quality control by Intellitouch.  While a number of people report the problems that I report, other people I know whose judgment and knowledge is impeccable report no such problems and adore them.  Some must be OK, but many must be crummy.  The Intellitouch Tuner's seemed to be the rage of Bluegrass and singer-song writer players around here about 10 years ago. They looked cool clipped onto the end of a banjo or guitar or fiddle.  They provided an image of the player as someone who was concerned with her or his tuning at every second of a performance.    A fool and his money were soon parted and I bought one.  I must say that I have about 8 different tuners for my guitars, banjos, and my fiddle. I find the Intellitouch to be the most useless one I have ever bought other than cheap 5 or ten buck tuners that don't last after a month of use.  I advise musicians who care about the grind of working on stage or playing at home to get a 20 buck kord chromatic and, if you need to worry about tuning up while band members or an orchestra is also tuning, get a cheap pickup clip for it.    The intellitouch's systems with arrows is hard to figure out and much harder than a simple meter dial.  It is really hard to figure out when it is on the other end of a guitar or banjo from your eyes and is too big to fit on a fiddle and not effect your playing.  I think if you need to know whether you are in tune WHILE you are playing by wearing one of these things, you really need to do some work to train your ears to hear proper tuning, and to school yourself so you recognize proper notes. You also need to figure out how to adjust the tuning gears and pegs on your guitar or banjo properly or insure that your setup is ok on a fiddle, or perhaps get a decent fine tuning tail piece for your fiddle.  If you have to lean on this strap on to do it, you just aren't doing your business right!  The Intellitouches are not reliable at all if the battery runs down. Moreover, instead of using AAA, AA, or 9-volt batteries like most other tuners, batteries you can easily install and pick up in any store, these tuners use special batteries.  I use tuners to check the intonation of my fiddle as I struggle to learn the instrument. I also use tuners to check the intonation of my slide playing on electric and acoustic guitar and on banjo.  Any tuner with a dial is much easier for you to get a read, particularly while you are playing or practicing than these intellitouches.    Of course, if you are either playing electric instruments or using a pickup on acoustic instruments, these tuners are useless.    The basic 20 buck Korg Chromatic has all you will ever need in a tuner. If you have to tune up in the middle of music or other musicians tuning get a little clip on pickup to clip to your instrument's bridge.    I have found that cheap no-name guitar/bass tuners have features these don't have like a setting to memorize alternate tunings.  Moreover Korgs and most other dial tuners have calibrations for you to tune with added cents which may be useful for the classical violinist trying to tune even tempered.    If you are interested in style points, particularly if you play bluegrass or old time music as I do, try the Gold Tone Bluegrass tuner that has all the dial functions plus settings for G banjo tuning, guitar tuning, and fiddle or mandolin tuning.	-1
I have owned (2) of these-they both ate batteries, and the second one had a connection problem.  Neither registered the low "E" well at all.  Never again.	-1
Way too small for my dulicimer as well.  Wish I had read the reviews before ordering.	-1
This guitar is horrible. I can't believe that Fender would produce such crap. I would say that this guitar is barely a notch above First Act guitars, that one can purchase at Target and various toy stores, in terms of quality. I could barely get it to remain in tune while I finished tuning the other strings. The neck is unfinished and feels like a tree branch that was just de-barked.  I like the idea of a 3/4 scale guitar for small children. But I can't justify the poor quality of this instrument. For just another twenty dollars one can easily purchase an entry level full size guitar from Fender or Gibson that will do the job and is much better quality. I purchased this for my 12 year-old daughter who is just starting out playing. I returned it and replaced it with a Les Paul Junior which she is quite pleased with.	-1
There were many scratches all over the face of the white portion of the guitar when I opened it from the box.  However, it does work.	-1
Trigger stopped working within a week...	-1
A nice Strat, but be prepared to do a full setup. The one I received had the worst neck bow I have ever seen, the strings were touching the frets from 5 to 12 without even fretting them! Fortunately it adjusted straight or I would have returned it. After fixing that and the intonation, it became a nice Strat. Since those early days with it, I have put some Texas wound pickups and locking tuners on it, it's a keeper. UPDATE: 5 months later the neck has bowed beyond adjustment or repair (truss rod cant be loosened enough to allow the string tension to pull it back to flat). New neck coming, but I doubt I will be buying any more Squier products. At this price point, it will be Epiphone for me.	-1
I was really excited about receiving this case but, as soon as you put the little Martin in, it is apparent that its use for the little Martin was an afterthought. Technically, it fits, but it is REALLY snug on the sides, making it almost feel like you are forcing the guitar in and out of the case. Aditionally, there is extra room on either side of the body-portion that is right below the neck (presumabely, space that would be taken up by the baby Taylor). Lastly, Im not fully convinced that the case clears the top of the guitar when fully closed- fully tuned guitar went in, shut it (with slight effort to fully close, but more than I would have liked), and immediately opened it to discover my guitar was slightly out-of-tune. I am returning this and looking for a case that is specifically made for the little Martin.	-1
First all I hate gig bags hate em I bought one of these cases for a little Martin 3 years ago I liked it worked well got another one for another little Martin the other day took 3 weeks to get here an it was terrible the latches feel like if you open it a dozen times that will be it they'll break for sure 80 bucks is a lot for this case I got a regular full size case for 30 bucks off Craigslist an put a towel in it works great if you get one I hope it's better than what I got JUNK it's going back good luck	-1
The guitar looks great (although the one I got had green-tinted pickguard, not white as shown on the picture) and sounds like a strat should. However I had to return it immediately due to quality issues. 1) It had a crack on the lacquer surface where the neck meets the body. 2) I had horrible hum that could be eliminated by touching the strings or the bridge. This is a somewhat common issue with electric guitars, but the amount of hum was much greater than with any other guitar I plugged to my amp before. (Note that this is not the kind of hum that humbucker pickups eliminate - the noise was even louder on the 2nd and 4th switch positions). 3) The neck is slightly misaligned - high E string is too close to the edge of the fretboard while the low E is further.  For what it's worth, this guitar is worse in quality than also made in china extra-cheap Giannini G-100 from Costco (where it is sold for $100). Both are made in China and appear pretty identical, but Giannini seems to have a better quality control.  Sound-wize this guitar is marginally superior to Giannini.	-1
These guitars look beautiful , especially the new FMT ones but BEWARE ! The pickups are terrible ! And the agathis wood is not very toneful. I had bought two of them, the first one the pickups were microphonic so they allowed me to trade for a squire classic vibe surf strat ( very good sounding guitar because of the pups but it also had flaws ) then i decided to try to buy another squier standard. Bad mistake ! The pickups work but they sound like you are dragging a hubcap across a tin roof ! Especially at higher gain. They build the pickups with quality plastic covers , stagger the poles , so they look cool , but they are terrible . The body, paintjob and hardware is good , and the necks aren't bad , but unless you are going to put an EMG or high output pups in, you won't get much out of these. Its a shame because they are nice looking guitars with 22 fret necks but they suck. They need to at least use basswood as the body wood. That is what my surf strat is made of and its a great playing guitar. If you are going to get a squier, get their classic vibe series- they still have a few flaws but are put together alot better.  And as a side note, they sent me the wrong guitar - a squire bullet HSS and it was better sounding than the Standard i got ? Squier really isn't that great of a company. Their competitor Epiphone makes better low end guitars but strats are better looking.  The best way to get a squier is to have it sent to a local shop and try before you buy.	-1
Ran across the Squier guitar online while looking at Fender Strats.  It is a beautiful guitar.  Read the reviews and fell for the bargain price.  Decided to take a chance.  To be frank, this guitar sounds terrible when compared to a quality Fender.  Adjusted the action, set the intonation, replaced the tuners then the pickups, and it still sounds un-bearingly bad.  In my opinion, the problem is in the wood.  It just doesn't resonate.  Again, the guitar looks great and plays great.  The neck is great.  But that tinny, stinging tone is awful.  Thought about making more mods i.e. wiring, pots, bridge, nut, etc. but it's just not worth it.  This guitar is completely unusable for a working musician.  So for anyone on the fence, trying to decide...Squier?..Fender?....You do get what you pay for.	-1
This might be good for something other than why I bought, which was for tuning an autoharp. The opening is too big for the tuning pins and slides around on the pins.  I'm going to have to spring for something better so I don't ruin the pins and/or the board that holds the pins.	-1
Purchased to tune a First Act Lap Harp, but the machining is poor quality and it would not work.	-1
If Yamaha had named this something other than a 'fife', I would have no problem with it. But because the fingerings are considerably different than a fife, it is of no help to anyone wishing to learn to play a fife.  Call it a 'Flufe' or a 'Recorfe' or anything else Yamaha, but when you call something a 'fife' there is an expectation that it's actually a fife.	-1
Very limited sound.	-1
It is hard to play and does not have a good sound quality. I always wanted to try a fife  to see what the difference between it and a flute is. I guess the difference is it doesn't sound good and is harder to play.	-1
Completely defective.	-1
Not good	-1
I must say I'm very surprised that no other reviewers have pointed this out yet. This thing is HEAVY. I have 3 DW double-braced cymbal stands and I can't put this thing on any of them. The stand immediately falls to whatever side I put it on, even when I attach it without a cymbal in it. Perhaps my stands aren't the best in the world, but I've used other arms that have worked just fine. This thing is way too heavy. I don't know what kind of stands everyone else is using, but this just won't work for me.	-1
Try as I can,so far,I can not get a damn single note out of it,and I am a clarinet player. I admit flutes work bit different in blow hole than a sax or clarinet and I also have a new flute I do not know yet how to play,,,,but.....I can get notes out of a metal flute and plastic recorder,but...not this fife. Is it me or fife or both?Do not know. Asumming it is me,I gave it 2 stars,instead of 1 star.	-1
The fifle in a good condition however I can not use it... Some how the holes won't make different sound. TRy the other brands...	-1
Basically this was intended for my daughter but she could not play it due to the difficulty of merely trying to get it to make a sound, much less trying to play a progression. Even when I tried to make a sound on it I found it very difficult.	-1
The product itself is ok but these things were way too overpriced you can find other ones for much cheaper.	-1
Showed up broken and to late to get a new one in time for Christmas. If it had not been broken it was probably a good value.	-1
The actual produce seems great and sturdy. If I could drill into a stud I'm sure it would be perfect, but I can't. It comes with plastic anchor screws to go into regular drywall and vague "instructions" to install them. I interpreted the instructions as the following:  "1 - Drill in the metal screw and then remove it to make a pilot hole." "2 - Screw the plastic plugs in." "3 - Install the hanger, screwing the metal screws into the plastic ones"  The problem is that the plastic screws were not sharp enough to go into the wall. Instead they bored out a 1/2" hole in my apartment drywall... damage that I will now later have to fix.  If I am doing this totally wrong somebody please correct me and I will edit my rating. Otherwise avoid this product unless you have the luxury of hanging your guitars on studs.	-1
I play with multiple groups (concert/jazz/quintet) and needed a portable stand that could hold up a full dance book.  At first, this was a great stand.  Sturdy and tall enough for comfortable stand up playing.  However, when setting up for a gig this past Tuesday, the clamp that holds the adjustable downpost in place broke and the stand will no longer stay up.  I baby my equipment, and am sure I never overtightened the clamp.  I only collapsed and set up this stand 15-20 times before it broke.  Luckily I was able to hold the piece in position for the gig with an extra spring clamp, but I am sadly dissappointed with this stand.  ***UPDATE*** I was able to work with the manufacturer and get a replacement clamp for my stand.  The new clamp has a slightly different design and is much sturdier.  I have used the new piece for months now with no problems.  However, the picture of this product still has the old piece, so I'm guessing they didn't change anything, but instead just replace the broken pieces with better ones.  Good customer service from On Stage, but still not a reliable product with the factory setup.	-1
The system is easy to mount and the cymbal is easy to attach BUT the mounting system TOTALLY ruins the thread even after just one tightening! They need to find a better system to secure it to the stand or even a thread though different brand use different sizes....	-1
Chicago harmonica..made in china..and from California?? haha oh well didn't sound as deep as thought or good although I am not expert player but seemed other ones I played sounded better maybe I liked different key of c or whatever though who knows, has plastic in middle part abit not sure if that cheaped sound if I knew this I may have bought higher quality metal one because seems plastic ones I played before were,n't ideal either	-1
Poor quality. After about 2 weeks of limited use one tone started failing. When I opened it saw that a membrane had broken off. A few others were already corroded. It's cheap but you get what you pay for.	-1
reeds started to bust 10 min in	-1
Zero quality all around! Why bother manufacturing and selling an item that is an insult to anyone with an ear for music?	-1
I have had to work with 2 ...They have short reeds so a great deal of metal is remove from each reed to get the tuning close on each note & close is often all you get. The reed plates thin and the plastic comb is weak, It bends [before breaking] much to easily, therefore the so a good air tight seal is not likely. Any entry level Hohner will be easier to play and last longer so will be a better bet for someone starting out.	-1
Compared to the original one which I had it on my 4C mouthpiece and was made in Japan, this one is just like a cheap copy!	-1
After initially breaking it in, i heard a loud crack and couldn't figure out what it was from.  I just know was trying to play some notes below the 12th fret and noticed they were buzzing really badly and checked on the neck and it was indeed cracked.  Probably won't buy epiphone again, was really nice for a few weeks.	-1
Junk	-1
is not the same size for my turntable, and the model is the same required.	-1
Slightly different than the original needle. I had to tape it to get it to stay on because it was missing a tab that holds the end up into place. I do not feel the quality was good enough for this price point. I would not buy this particular one again. I gave it two stars because I was able to make it work and it does sound good.	-1
Latches didn't line up, and case wouldn't stay shut. Had to return to Amazon, which is a pain due to the size of the box required. On the other hand, if you have a EJ-200, there are not many hard cases big enough to hild that guitar, so your options are limited.	-1
This stand has a chrome metal pole that goes into the hollow, black, vertical pole which is attached to the heavy three-pronged stand base . To adjust the height you simply pull or push on the chrome metal pole. Problem is the engineering of the chrome metal pole allows the chrome metal pole to rattle against the black one at the slightest touch. Very noisy.	-1
Opening too big. Was unplayable.	-1
one of the pipes doesn't make sound at all, the rest are all sharp when checked against several  digital devices.  oh well $5 and plastic. kinda says it all	-1
Played these for years on strat and ES335. Was always happy - lately though these have been a huge let down. Corrosion/pitting out of the pack. Strings are dead/lifeless response after a few days of lite play. No breaks but this particular DR product seems to have changed. Granted they are not expensive - but they are not the former version I recall using. Perhaps DR had altered their process or materials. These are no longer reliable strings.   :( I won't be buying again.	-1
I have been extremely disappointed in these strings.  I regularly use round core pure nickel (Pyramid Classics) strings, so am aware of the need to pre-bend before cutting them to length.  Never had a problem with other round core, but of three sets of DR (2 sets of .10s, 1 set of .09's) none of them were usable.  I could not intonate the A strings in the 10s sets, and the A string in the 9s sets buzzed all over the fretboard.  I wanted to switch to these from Pyramid since they are expensive, DRs are much more reasonable.  I'll probably try once more in the future, maybe I just got a bad batch, but two different gauges on two different guitars makes me wonder.	-1
This pitch pipe is tuned flat to the true tones of G, D, A & E.  I've compared it to three different electronic/digital tuners (one on my smart phone and two stand-alone tuners owned by my teacher) and the pipe is consistantly flat.  It is not useful except for gross comparison to get a slack string close enough to the correct pitch to finish tuning with a digital tuner.	-1
The sounds are only good for the initial tuning but no good for fine tuning. If compared with an electronic Boss TU-12H tuner the sounds are off. I bought 4 of these pitch pipes they are all off one way or the other.	-1
Looks like from other reviews its a hit and miss item. The G port was blocked by the reed so I opened tuner case and carefully bent reed back reed away from port opening so it could vibrate a sound. Great if mine worked otherwise just two stars.	-1
Purchased thinking these would be good for my beginner son on alto sax.  The plastic may make these more durable but you cannot we them so you get an sound that is not entirely desirable.  Went back to regular reeds.	-1
These (I bought several) aren't that well in tune, and you can vary the pitch depending on the angle in your mouth and how hard you blow.  Spring for a few bucks more and get an electronic clip-on marvel!	-1
Height is not adjustable.  For the price it is not acceptable.	-1
innaccurate, slow to measure, and the metronome subdivisions are actually wrong. this is NOT worth buying. There are better products available in the same price range.	-1

I'd tried a bari medium and it was barely playable; too stiff. I bought this bari soft and had the same problem - way too stiff for me. I tried it on a Selmer Goldentone 3, a Vito 4C, an Otto Link 5-star with no luck. Didn't bother with the Beechler 7.	-1
Works well on some strings, just sits there and waits on other strings. I think of these as frequency "dead spots." Purchased for use with a 12 string. As a capo, not bad, but not as good as my Kyser. As a tuner, the dead spot thing is the deal breaker. I have other tuners that work just fine on the same guitars, and you'd think the capo tuner would "hear" the string better, being right on the neck. Not so. Intellitouch is going back  I think.  Another drawback on this design is that the tuner is not so easy to read as you move it higher on the neck. A tilt-able display would make it much more readable in higher positions.  I've tried this on 6 and 12 string guitars, acoustic and electric. The dead-spots occur on all of them. This is not the only tuner with the issue. Recently picked up a Korg Pitchhawk-g as a deal of the day just to have an extra one. I'm amazed that established companies will sell these things with such sketchy performance.  For the 12 string I am using a Peterson strobe clip-on. I thought it was a little extravagant at the time but it works. It just works. Imagine that, Intellitouch. Imagine that, Korg.	-1
I had an Intellitouch mini which worked well http://www.amazon.com/Intellitouch-PT10-Mini-Clip-On-Tuner/dp/B002KDHBRU?ie=UTF8&keywords=intellitouch%20mini&qid=1460055261&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1  I recommend it. I also use a capo... So I thought-why not? I always tune again when putting on the capo anyway and I use a lot of alternate tunings... The tuner part is not very responsive (not as good as the mini) I should have returned it right away. The capo part? Well...it broke off in my hand after only 6 weeks!!! Not returnable now.  Kyser is the best capo http://www.amazon.com/Kyser-KG6K-6-Strg-Capo-Pink/dp/B000EELGVO?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage The capo part BROKE!	-1
Not very good.  I tried it on many of my guitars.  It did not pick up the tuning on the low "E" at any fret! It also took a long time to lock in on the note. It did not respond at all correctly on the head stock. Not recommended.	-1
Combining a capo and tuner is a great idea.  But, unfortunately, it's not a great tuner.  If you tune a note while it is ringing, then stop the note and play it again, you get a different reading.  So, unlike other tuners where I can tune in real time, with this one I have to play a note, see where I'm at, make an adjustment, then play it again to see where I am now.  Very slow and annoying.  The capo is made out of metal, which is nice (the tuner electronics are in a plastic insert embedded in the aluminum body).  It seems pretty sturdy.  But there is no tension adjustment, so it made my guitar go a little bit sharp.  It wasn't too bad - most people probably wouldn't notice.  The rubber did leave a light mark on my strings though.  I decided to put this one on my backup/beater guitar.  I use my Snark tuner (which I love) and an adjustable tension capo on my main rig.	-1
Arrrghhhhhh....!	-1
This doesn't do a good job at all. I wish that i could return it! My advise to anyone is just don't buy it. WHAT A WASTE!	-1
I waited 6-8 months to receive this mixer because they didn't have it in stock, I finally received it on June 3rd, I try it the first time and worked ok, the second time that I used it was for a event at Church and I started using the effects, in the middle of the event the mixer started making this awful noise, I lowered all the volumes but it didn't stop so, I turned the main volume all the way down and it stopped, I turned off and back on and was ok until 15 minutes later it happened again, I turned everything off and tried at home the very next day, and the same thing happened this time I started looking for more specifics and the noise is coming from the main volume (white bottom) for the effects right above the blue sliding volume. I tried to returned but it was one day over the period that you have to return it so, now I have a mixer that is useless, because even that I turned that volume all the way down, you can still ear some distortion specially at church where you can hear pretty much everything. This is the first time that I rate a product with one star in my 20 years buying on line.	-1
item arrived defective intoduced a ton of noise into the sound.	-1
JUST RAISED THEIR PRICE TO 10.98 plus 1.99 shipping? INSANE! DON'T BUY!!! Was worth the 1 to 2 dollars they used to charge, but this is ridiculous!!! ----- Doesn't fit the narrow openings of wooden recorders. Not very useful compared to making your own out of string and little pieces of cloth stitched together, custom fitting it to your instrument,  which is what I do and will continue to do. For when you drag your own swap with  little pieces of cloth on a string through your recorder or wind instrument, a one foot or longer string of them, they stay relatively dry while the inside of the recorder or wind instrument gets dried too. Thus they can thus be used again and again in the same session. Also of course a cheaper way to keep your instrument clean and dry inside. Sometimes do it yourself works better and is worth the extra effort. To each his own.	-1
Noisy, lots of hiss like all Behringer products I've used.	-1
This board won't even push my speakers louder than a cell phone. What's Up With That	-1
I've been using these since the 1960's. They used to sound a lot better and last a lot longer, but they're the only show in town so I keep buying them. I double a number of instruments and need to be able to just pick up a horn and play without having to wet the reed first. The new Plasticover Ricos don't sound nearly as good as they used to in the old days, and the plastic flakes off after a while. Unfortunately, nobody else offers plastic coated reeds anymore. In 1967, I bought a large quantity of Rico Plasticovers from a music store that went out of business. I still had some of those left until a couple of years ago. When I finally had to break down and buy some new ones, I was appalled by the drop in quality. It's shocking when you can directly compare new Ricos with New Old Stock Ricos. I guess this must be some more of that "New Normal" I keep hearing about.	-1
Kind of works half of the time and then will go into convolutions and midi spasms.  Not just midi misfires or retriggers, I'm talking every note playing almost like an arpeggiator but totally random and not good.  Because it's passive (runs of midi power) and there is no panic button on it, I have to unplug all of the cables and let the power light on it slowly flicker off before I can plug everything in again so it "works" for however long before I have to do this again, usually 5-20 minutes.  Why do I have to do that?  Not sure if I got a faulty unit or maybe its just a bad design but based off of what I have received here I would not recommend purchasing this device	-1
I bought this so that I could run two pieces of gear into my MIDI interface without having to juggle cables around - an Axe-Fx II and a set of Roland TD4 vDrums. Neither of them work when connected to this, unfortunately. Using SysEx Librarian I get garbled MIDI messages from both devices when this is in the signal path.	-1
SAD and flimsy.  My Bad...	-1
it doesn't come with the label marking which string is suppose to be, confusing to begin with, the string is flimsy and doesn't sound as good as the original string that my guitar comes with.	-1
i don't like it too thick	-1
Too much oil on it.	-1
Bought 5 packs on good review, Open tune "A" on National Resonator Guitar. Broke 2 BRAND NEW G strings (tuned up to A) while restringing. I know that this is a great deal of tension, however these are the FIRST strings that I remember ever breaking stringing or playing this guitar in over 10 years. Going to stick to my others, will not name brand out of respect. (brand starts with a D).  Inferior quality, might be ok for regular tuning: however my experience supports comments of strings going dead fast...  If anyone from John Pearse reads this, you can contact me... sent strings back to Amazon - thanks Amazon for being great on returns	-1
Flimsy crap, the way it folds up is terrible, the thin metal sections actually get tangled up within each other. Needs about a half foot of desk behind it to stand.	-1
These picks are made from the smoothest, slipperiest plastic I've ever used. At first they were fine when practicing, but in the summer during rehearsals or for gigging once my fingers get sweaty they slide all over the place. No bueno. Their max grip picks are amazing...love em...but these...no thanks.	-1
Not even a good toy product.  Planet waves has some very good items,  but this thing is junk,	-1
Junk	-1
Very, very cheap! Don't do it!	-1
junk, screw stripped, peg puller does not fit, cheap. get a much better one at G.C. for $1.99.	-1
These are horrible. The edges are rough and just don't feel finished. Took a Dremel to sand the edges so I could use them. Ended up giving them all away.	-1
Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well.	-1
Works but barely.  I say that in terms of stability.  The guitar has considerable movement when mounted.  Right side up is not as bad but fretboard down barely works.  Maybe for a ukulele.	-1
Well, I should have listened to the bad reviews.  This is flimsy.  It's just not stable enough to hold up my guitar neck while I do string changes, cleaning, maintenance, etc.  I used it a few times and it's too frustrating.  Good idea, and nice design (the folding up is great for storage).  But not good execution. This is a cheap-feeling plastic and is too light to adequately support my guitar.  I opted to buy a "shooting bag" that rifle shooters use to hold up their guns while they lie on the ground and target shoot.  It's non-slip, soft, heavy, and the right height to support the guitar neck.  It's really a much better alternative. Here is the one I bought, Primos Group Therapy Rear Shooting Bag  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BD4UAU2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1	-1
SAD and flimsy.  My Bad...	-1
Really cheap, thin plastic.  I wonder how long this will work before it breaks...	-1
i was rather disappointed when i first hit this head,i like the fact that its durable but i seems as if the thickness of the head dampens  its sound an awful lot,it may just be my tuning but im currently not a fan,i bought this head with the remo emperor tom heads, the tom heads are awesome i love their sound but the snare was an utter disappointment	-1

This get's 2 stars only because of the price.  If you're buying this to change strings, look somewhere else. This is too flimsy and you will need a sturdy neck stand.  This item was made to expand so it saves on shipping costs and storage for the factory and retailers. What that means for us is that all the joints are weak and need to be reinforced so that you can actually use it.  This is what I did and made a huge difference. SUPER GLUE IT SO IT IS FIXED IN THE EXPANDED POSITION.	-1

this piece of plastic is just terrible.  you'd be better off with a couple of books and a towel. not recommended!	-1
I mean it works and all that but I was not impressed with it. It was cheap and didn't hurt the bank. I mean if your at a table reading music you really do not need this anyway.	-1
Go build your own. Build it to your specs and have a solid stand. If not, you can find a lot better head stands. This one was a huge disappointment. Does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick. Im back with my wood block and am happy.	-1
Device does not sit level on table even after making sure it was fully opened.  Prop arm is very difficult to extend. Rubber cap on prop arm falls off. Hamilton needs to reexamine its quality control efforts.	-1

You get what you pay for and the price is very cheap! I am sending this back at a loss to me just to get it out of my sight. The Stagg Table Top is a far better table top stand and for only a few bucks more.	-1
I've been playing guitar for over 40 years and have tried many different kinds of strings on many different acoustic and electric guitars.  I put these on my Martin OM21 and was immediately underwhelmed.  I actually thought about removing them and tossing them right away but I wanted to give them a chance.  After several weeks I still don't understand all of the rave reviews - I find them truly unexceptional.  I'll take a set of D'Addario EXP's over these any day of the week. Needless to say, your mileage may vary.	-1
These strings lose their brightness quickly	-1
Arrived rusty. Some people swear by John Pearse, I'll never buy the brand again.	-1
I bought into they hype about these strings and got them for my Taylor 514ce (Adirondack top). These strings are NOT better than Elixirs. They sound thin and lifeless. There is a reason why Elixirs are almost twice as expensive.	-1
This pick unfortunately does not grip well.  Some players hands (like me), oil up.  Even sweat...  That said, the pick becomes slippery, hard to manage.  Great if you prefer a glass style pick.	-1
Just replaced a set of month-old Martin SPs with these Pearses, and I'm wishing I would have left the old strings on. These sound pretty weak. Same gauge, but feel looser - maybe a smaller core wire? Whatever it is, it's not a good match for my Gibson AJ at all. Maybe they have more character and power on a shorter scale guitar. Back to the SPs for me.	-1
I was sent a bag of generic, standard, WHITE bridge pins, when the product picture clearly shows black bridge pins with white dots.  This is not what I wanted, BLATANTLY FALSE ADVERTISING.  I also have to mention that these bridge pins are constructed out of cheap plastic.	-1
I bought many strings the last 2 weeks and this is one of them. These strings have no life in them. I like other d'addarios but not the coated one. Now I am mainly using Martin S54050,D'addario EJ13, Or Gibson Masterbuilt 11. All custom 11 gauge on my Seagull Rustic Mini Jumbo.	-1
The adjustment screw wore out after just a few weeks. Spend a little more and buy a better quality product	-1
The pick is really comfortable to hold but unfortunately it's so hard that the pick noise is unbearable	-1
I'd never tried these before but the price was good so I got them. From the product description I thought they would be a softer plastic, with a feeling more like Ultex, which is my current Dunlop favorite for a mellow electric sound on chrome strings. Instead they have a twangy brittle tone with a noticeable pick sound. On acoustic with nylon and also with steel strings they are twangier and more brittle sounding than Clayton Acetal picks, which are about the hardest picks I like to use.  Dunlops have that little divot on the top that you see in the pictures. That looks like a sprue site for injection molding. These have the worst I've seen, with more roughness and irregularity than the relatively tame ones on Ultex picks.  So I've put these on top of my dresser and will try to find a use for them. They are a bright color so I may drill holes in them to use them on key rings or something. They are too small for skeet targets	-1
In a month the clamp looked horrible the strings came off looks bad to present to others the good thing that it does its job my mic is still holding up but with time it looks horrible	-1
I bought these for my Martin D-18. There pins are made in Mexico for Martin. They are cheap plastic bridge pins that cost about the same as Martin's solid wood ebony pins. I would recommend skipping these and buying the solid wood pins. If you want white, you will need to search for bone pins that cost about $25.00.	-1
I've been a user of Dunlop Tortex triangle picks for a long time and decided to try these. The material makes your fingers feel sweaty the instant you pick it up. The recessed part in the middle is supposed to help you grip them better, but it is textured in such a way that it actually reduces the surface area touching your fingers and it's actually more slippery than the untextured outer edges. The only way I could get these picks to be somewhat usable was to scratch up the surface with a knife so as to be actually grippy.	-1
I noticed that some people find Gorilla Snot messy.  You may want to try Monster Grips.  I love these!  They're very tactile, they provide a great grip, and they're not at all messy. https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Grips-Ultimate-Guitar-Picks/dp/B00JER27MO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494881894&sr=8-1&keywords=monster+grips+-+the+ultimate+grip+for+guitar+picks	-1
Very hard to remove from fingers - yes the picks don't fly off, but I have yet to figure out how to get the stuff off without using strong solvents. Too much trouble to use for short song brackets	-1
total waste.  seriously?  This is the most messy crap ever.  It gets everywhere!!!!  Im going to stick to stick wraps	-1
OK, it does work but a little too sticky for me, will say it hangs in there for hours.  Like cutting down a pine tree and running fingers through the sap in the cross section.  I prefer the Zildjian stick wax.  I don't mind the pine but the wax is a better smell.	-1
Yes, it is sticky and the name is cool.  When, I perform, my picks get really slick when my hands sweat, and they move around between my fingers.  This was not the answer.  Everything gets sticky, and the picks still move.	-1
When I first receive this product, I opened it up and found the top layer of the substance already hardened. I had to remove that layer before getting to the usable stuff. May be I'm just not used to having stuff on my hands and fingers (I don't even like using hand lotions), but this stuff is very sticky, and has a funny smell to it. It probably take some time to get used to this stuff, but I've decided to find other ways to get better grip of my guitar picks instead of using substances like this on my hand. This will probably be the only jar of this "snot" I'll ever purchase.	-1
I wonder now what I expected from this purchase. Its a small jar of sticky stuff. It reminds of the time I stuffed a bunch of Peppermint Pattys in my gig bag and they melted all over my picks. I don't remember once saying to myself "I have a much better grip on these picks now". Like that, this product just feels messy like I need to wash it off. If I have to play Pollyanna, I should mention it smells nice.	-1
Too much hype here. Not as crisp and clear as some reviewers suggest.  This microphone is an ok hobbyist tool. But it is anything but something to use for more than that.  Notes: 1) Emits a foul sharp odor that smells like burning plastic. Sometimes, makes me want to choke and cough. 2) You have to direct your voice into the area above the label else it sounds "lost" 3) Has a tinge of a deep, lower bass sound from it. 4) For vocals, if you have to hit a loud note, it breaks up miserably. You have to back off the mic a good 12 inches to avoid this. And it sounds really horrible.  Overall a decent microphone for the price. Well built, sturdy construction. Nice extra with the shock mount. But you get what you pay for.  Update 1/2/13: Backing this down to 2 stars. The shock mount screws as they sit into the shock mount ring will no longer fit as they worse out. I can no longer use the mount with a mic stand because the outer ring wore out.	-1
Amazon processed the refund quickly, so that was cool. The bag came broken, with a zipper that was off the track. The bag itself seemed nice, but the flaw caused the return. Regarding the size of the bag, it's pretty small, so you may not get so much in it. It reminded me of a laptop case, maybe five inches bigger on each side. Of course, that won't work for most of you, but if you have very little to carry or transport, it may be ok.	-1
I bought this to replace and old SKB case that looks just like it which wore out after 2 years and is coming apart. I immediately returned this bag, there is no way, I was going to carry around a 1400.00 effects system (AX8) in this flimsy bag. This is basically like my kids backpack, there is very little padding and nothing at all rigid to protect what's inside of it. The SKB bag wasn't the most sturdy thing in the world but it was much better than this bag, so I will be purchasing another one unless I can get my hands on an aluminum case instead. I bought this because it obviously has great reviews, but I'm growing more and more skeptical about these reviews of these products, as this is obviously bogus information on this product.	-1
So this was my first condenser and having no prior experience I thought it was great until finally about a year later after really trying to use it I discovered my recordings had this terrible hum which turned out to be electricity and the mic not being grounded. I would touch the metal mesh on the mic and the hum would get crazy loud so here I was crazy trying to find solutions on how to ground my laptop or mic or whatever it was coming from.. instead the mic just broke and began to crackle and pop... it was ruined. So now I buy an Audio Techinica 2035 and VIIOLA... absolute pristine recordings! Absolutely no hum! Beautiful rich sounding! I've learned my lesson now and I would NOT suggest this mic. Spend the measly extra 40$ and get a TRUE honest and superior quality Audio Techinca or something else other than this. I'm so happy with my new mic now I can't believe what I was working with before. These mic's are not even true large diaphram microphone but the 2035 is AND it came with a stage stand, a shock mount, a leather pouch, AND quality xlr cable for 141$ on ebay! So if you want true superior hassle free quality go with a 2035 in this price range. I feel like I just graduated into a higher class within 5 minutes of owning and testing it... no hum at ALL.	-1
These picks are tiny. Dunlop sells 1.0 and 2.0. They give you a ridiculous item # - "474P2.0" and we are somehow supposed to know their relative size. I purchased the 1.0mm version at a store. They were red and somewhat smaller than the garden variety guitar pick. The 1.0 is great because it is nearly frictionless. I was surprised to find I could play a lot faster than with a standard pick. That said, I thought a heavier pick would work better so I ordered these. As I said, they are tiny, and about half the size of the 1.0. If I wanted to go to their website and "research" the varieties and sub-varieties of picks Dunlop offers I might have known this pick is a different series. =OR= Dunlop could have simply provided a photo showing me the relative size of the pick here, where it would be useful.  So the rating is because it is half the size of the pick I thought I was buying. Returning.	-1
They're way too small (by design, I know) and the material is not conducive to gripping.	-1
my Line 6 HD500X barely fits in the bag. I think it will wear out fast especially the zippers from the force that I have to use to close it when my pedal is inside.. AGAIN, HD500X BARELY FITS... RETURNED FOR FULL REFUND...	-1
Rec'd case w/defective latch & the advertised dimensions couldn't be more incorrect. It didn't even come close to fitting the guitar I ordered it for. It would've been perfect had it been the advertised dimensions. I'm not sure if the misinformation is the fault of the vendor or the manufacturer but, regardless, I had to return the case. I do wish that the vendors would verify the product related information BEFORE they post it because, in most instances, that is what the buyer relies on to make the purchase. Ther was no problem returning the item but it was an inconvenience  I really did not need!!	-1
TOO STIFF	-1
First of all, this stand is not sturdy at all. I actually bent it a little just putting it together. I have a song book that really isn't very heavy. I put it on this stand, and now the shelf is crooked from the weight. Its very wobbly, and sometimes it falls when I change music. Do not recomend	-1
Good stuff but I hate the smell!  It doesn't need to have a fragrance to work.	-1
Too much metallic, rough sound!!!	-1
I ordered this cable after reading all the positive reviews.  Cable shipped quickly, had it at my door in two days. I was excited and ready to test it out, take it for a test drive if you may say. I made my connections and almost immediately, I got a hum out of my amplifiers speakers. I tried a different amp with no success.  So, I put back my original cable and the hum is no longer there.  This cable is horrible, however if you are into the hum scene, go ahead and purchase one.  I will say this about the cable, it does look like it is solid or put together nicely.  Too bad, I am getting this hum, I was looking forward to to hearing my daughter sing.  I am packing this cable as I speak and will be returning it for full refund.  I am a technical person, have been a systems consultant for 30 years, so I know a little about cables.	-1
I really wanted to like this guitar. I played it for a couple of weeks, hoping the flaws would stop bothering me, but I finally realized I just had to overlook too much to feel okay keeping it. I sent it back.  First of all, the good things. It sounded good, really good, what with the P90s and the fully hollow body. I think the Casino Elitist sounded better, a little richer and more solid, but it was close; really they were both good sounds, just different, almost coming down to personal preference. And the action felt good, too, low and fast. The quality of the woodwork was good overall, except for a clumsily-cut curve in the headstock, which disappointed me because, to my eye, this nice little arc carved on each side of the headstock is part of the iconic design of the Casino, a nice little detail that sets it apart from its Gibson cousins. The polyurethane finish was well done, smooth and even.  But the stain was another story. It was applied in blotches, and you could see streaks and sponge marks where the stain had been allowed to dry too much before wiping off, or something of this nature. Streaky, ugly, blotchy. Not good.  The pots appeared to be cheap, and when you twisted them, they wobbled on their axis rather than spinning straight. This did not inspire confidence; I feared for their longevity.  But the frets were the deal killer. The fret job was abandoned halfway to completion. Maybe they thought nobody would notice. Maybe a lot of people wouldn't. Here's what they did: the frets were pressed into the fingerboard, the ends smoothed off, and the frets were leveled with a file or belt sander. Then some worker began the job of crowning the frets with a fret file . . . and there it ended, throw the guitar in a box and ship it out the door. The crowning was never completed, so the tops of the frets were not properly rounded, but were left way too flat, too wide. And the file (or belt sander) marks had not been sanded smooth, so the harshly flat tops of all the frets had ridges in them like corduroy! Imagine what that feels like when you play it. Bend a string and instead of a nice smooth feel--and sound--you get this grinding feel, and a grinding sound as well. It was kind of funny, kind of funky in a dime-store cheapo guitar way, like some $29 Woolworth guitar one of those old real roots Chicago blues guys might have played back in the '50s . . . but for a guitar at this price point, a guitar that's trying to be a real grown-up guitar instead of a toy guitar--this is completely unacceptable. Laughable really, deserving of scorn. Where was quality control? Or is this the standard the once-proud Epiphone company has set for itself? I will never know the answer, but I do know I will never risk buying one of these junkers again. It cost me over 80 bucks to ship this guitar and case back to the online store I bought it from--they shipped the guitar and case separately, so two boxes, two FedEx bills--so, expensive experiment.  Too bad, because I really wanted to like this guitar.	-1
A beautiful guitar, and just the right size. However, it would not stay in tune and the POTS sometimes would not work at all, and sometimes would just suddenly start to work. I sent it back and after my last couple of experiences wit Epiphone I would not buy another until their quality control is seriously upgraded.	-1
One of the E strings broke while I was restringing and the others were so bright and buzzed so bad that I threw them away.	-1
Hmmm...This is the second time I've tried these. I'm hard on mandolin strings and wanted something that last longer then non coated strings, but frankly, these just don't sound as good to me as D'addario J74's.  Now the J74's don't last as long as these, but...for the first three weeks just sound great compared to these.  I tend to change strings every 6-8 weeks if I'm playing everyday.  These coated ones will sound pretty decent for ten or more weeks, where as the j74's (If I don't break a string) will deaden in about six weeks of daily hour or more a day play. But, still if you want tone, the J74's just sound better then the exp74's.	-1
I wasn't enthralled with the strings. Wouldn't buy them again.	-1
Didn't last 6 months. Developed a crackle/short under light usage.	-1
Awful, second one I bought and became defective within less than 3 days of normal use. I have straight ones I've not had a problem with, but these L shaped ones just seem to go to cr@p right away. Don't buy this garbage.	-1
I bought these strings for a 30" short scale bass, and had 3 problems.  1) The E string was too long for my bass, and had to be shortened at the bridge end.  2)The strings were too large for the nut on the guitar, and I had to have a new one made.  3)The E string is too floppy for this scale. Really floppy. This same gauge might be ok on a 34" scale, but not for a 30" scale.  The A,D, and G strings worked ok lengthwise. They weren't too floppy either.  If you have a short scale bass, pass on these.	-1
I love Planet Waves. They are cheap and decently durable. They aren't top quality and will eventually wear out, probably faster than more expensive ones but they will a while. I always get the cords that have the 90 degree angle on one end which will help with the wear and tear. I bought a few of these to use in a church environment and things get abused more than I'd like, so far they have held up!  *****REVIEW EDIT***** These are not holding up as well as they usually do. Since, the review all of the cords that I purchased have broken.  I bought them right before Christmas 2015 and now it is Easter and they all have failed	-1
This cable is junk. It's very noisy. Every time it touches itself it makes a tapping noise through the amplifier. You can clearly hear it when you plug it in and if you take a loop of the cable and tap it against itself, there is audible noise. It also seems to pick up stray RF and causes the amp to be noisy.  Do NOT recommend.	-1
After 3 months, this cabel has developed a fatal short. It's unusable. The Amazon dealer won't take it back. Now I have to see if it's worth chasing the manufacturer for a return or replacement.  UPDATE: due to the great price on this cable, I bought another. After 5 months it is now shorting out. I will now spend about half of what it's worth sending it back to D'Addario to try to cash in on the 'lifetime guarantee'.	-1
Cable broke.	-1
You get what you paid, at first works fine, but after light use (4 or 5 months) at home, begins to fail, dark and muddy sound, scratch noise, until no sound seems to be have very fragile the inner wire.  Maybe for static use works I mean to patch some equipment, but for guitar doesn't work, get a better cable.	-1
TL;DR: Started cutting out within very few uses, and you don't want that to happen to you: get something else.  I bought this and Planet Waves' upscale "Custom Series" cable, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002H09OS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage, at the same time, to compare.  Neither had been used much before this one started cutting out.  It lasted through a few sessions at home; it was never gigged.  I bought a Planet Waves Custom Series cable http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002H09OS?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 at the same, to compare the two.  That one still works, but I'm not a big fan of them either.	-1
I'm so disappointed with this cable. I've purchased hundreds of Planet Waves products over the course of my career, and I've never encountered something like this. The cable already doesn't work. Maybe I got a lemon, but I definitely want a replacement.	-1
I recently remodeled my office, and decided to hang my many guitars.  I have several on a long piece of Slatwall, and the rest hung up on individual hangers.  I have three of these String Swing hangers, and two each from Hercules and On-Stage.  The Hercules were purchased here on Amazon, and the On-Stage are the brand favored by the local guitar store, so I got them there.  Of the three, my favorite is easily the Hercules.  The wood is the most nicely finished, and the hanger pivots more freely, and locks the neck in place when the guitar is hung from it.  But when I went to order more, they weren't in stock.  Amazon has spoiled me...when I want something, I want it right now, and I could get the others quicker.  The Hercules hangers are also twice the cost of the other two, but that wasn't a factor for me...after all, you're hanging an expensive instrument...who really want's to skimp on the only thing keeping it from damage?  Next, I prefer the On-Stage brand.  I looked for them on Amazon, but didn't find them.  They don't lock the guitar in place like the Hercules, but the yokes are strong, and pivot freely accommodating all types of guitars.  Both of those two are pretty strong.  Pulling on the yoke by hand doesn't reveal much give.  But I needed three more for the last three guitars, which I hadn't originally planned on hanging...so I ordered these from Amazon with same day delivery.  They will do the job, but they're not as good as the other two.  First, although you can't see it in the picture, the way these work is that the yolk has a long threaded shaft that goes through the plastic spacer (the part that's shown touching the wood in the picture.  There is also a rubber washer-grommet thing that goes between the plastic spacer and the yoke.  After mounting the base to the wall, you put the washer and spacer on the threaded post and then thread that shaft into the metal thread insert that's pre-installed in the wood.  You tighten the yoke untill the rubber washer compresses enough that the yoke begins to tighten.  If you leave it loose enough that the yoke will automatically pivot to match an odd-shaped headstock (like a Telecaster), the whole thing feels pretty flimsy overall.  When you put the guitar in the hanger, the yoke will sag downward under its weight, and you can visibly see the yoke move...like a quarter inch, or more.  You can also see the spacer sliding against the wood base!  If you turn the yoke another turn or two, so that the rubber washer is more compressed and the whole thing is tighter, it does firm things up a bit, but everything still sags.  If you use them like this, the yoke won't pivot freely to match your headstock...so you either have to turn it by hand, or hang the same guitar in the same hanger all the time.  That's probably how most folks do it anyway, but I'll often move my guitars from one spot to another.  The thing is, BOTH of the other brands have a much thicker shaft, and feel a LOT more solid once installed, while being free to pivot and accommodate whatever guitar is hung from them.  In my case, I've hung my three lightest guitars (two accoustic and one semi-hollow electric) from these hangers.  Finally, the screws they include are too short!  The screws were two inch coarse-thread wood screws.  After you go through the wood base and your drywall, you'll have, at best, 3/4" of screw into the studs of your wall.  But remember, it's a wood screw with a long tapered tip...so the first 1/4" isn't holding much.  Also included with this stand are two drywall anchors...the E-Z anchor kind...white plastic with a deep screw thread that self-drill their way into the drywall and provide a hole for a smaller screw in the center.  This is just stupid...for one thing, if you're screwing into a stud in the wall, which you should be, these anchors won't work (and aren't necessary).  For another, while the ANCHOR itself is rated at some super high weight rating, it's the drywall itself you can't trust to hang a guitar!  No one in their right mind hangs an instrument from a hanger like this attached only to drywall.  So, bottom line?  Plan on finding some 2 1/2" or 3" wood screws to go along with these mounts, and please don't use the drywall anchors!  To be fair, the Hercules screws weren't long enough either, IMO, and both the Hercules and the On-Stage included cheap drywall anchors.  But again...you're crazy if you hang an expensive guitar from a hanger using only drywall anchors!	-1
OK sound. Failed in 1 month, upgraded to Mogami GOLDS and never had a problem since.	-1
I've bought a bunch of these over the last few years and 75% of them have gone bad within 2 years.  They simply don't last.  Get something better.	-1
Horrible. I've had 2 fail after just a few months. Save up for better cables.	-1
Was working great for about 2 months before it suddenly stopped giving me sound when plugged in. I had to rotate the cable jack about until I had sound coming out of my amp. I have several Planet Waves patch cables, one custom series cable (Had it for close to 3 years) and more recently, the American Stage series. So far none have failed me this badly. My suggestion? Just get the Custom Series or American Stage cables if you're gonna buy Planet Waves.	-1
These are pretty beefy strings even for black nylons, and while I'm used to slightly heavier strings for my fretless basses, these go too far.  There's simply no reason to use a .115 gauge E string unless you REALLY like taut strings and feel like getting a new bass setup.  They should swap the .115 string for a .050 gauge G string and shift the rest up so you'd get a .050-.065-.075-.100 set.  Actually, a .050-.065-.085-.105 set would be even better.  Hey wait, that's exactly what my La Bella 750N set uses - time to put those back on!	-1
I know, I know...you get what you pay for. However, I thought I'd get more than a few uses from them. Gentle home use, nothing more. I didn't pull on it or step on it but within days it started buzzing. I tried the spare and after a few days it started with the crackling too.  They were cheap enough to not go through the headache of trying to get my money back for this trash. Avoid these sorry cables. I wish I could give it zero stars.	-1
These are cheap and uncomfortable. But you get what you pay for usually.	-1
Only one pick arrived. Not 4.	-1
worked ok for a couple of uses then stopped working on me, love their more premium cables and wanted to try these but disappoint, love other products from this brand though.	-1
So like most people I got this Bc of good reviews so my cable arrived and I plug in and it's already buzzing so it was a broken cable didn't even last a day it says  guaranteed for life I want my money back don't waist your money on this	-1
Cheap construction.  Edges bite into my finger.  Not comfortable.  They could have at least smoothed the edges.  Nice idea tho'.	-1
Way too small to use even though my fingers are medium.	-1
This arrived in an undamaged large cardboard box. Opened up easy enough, to find this almost indestructible case .... destroyed. Mangled, bent like a banana, hole in the side, hinges broken etc. How did this happen? I think somebody at the ol' warehouse was upset because like I said the box didn't have a scratch. Amazon stepped up of course and made good on it but it was a waste of my time and theirs. And to be clear "I love SKB cases, especially the new models" they had nothing to do with this "mystery of the mangled case."	-1
Just spend a couple bucks more On a better cable. Don't be cheap when it comes to cables. Buy good quality cables that have life time warranty. Like monster.	-1
I'm trying to find finger picks that help me transition from alternate picking with a pick and these aren't the ones. This smaller size is about the size that would fit on my pinky and i have skinny fingers. I thought the round style would feel more natural since I've been playing finger style with just the flesh of my fingertips and I trim my nails but that wan't giving me the speed I'm used to with my pick, but these picks feel very clunky and clumsy. No matter what i do, twist them partially, or put them on backwards whatever... these picks overall feel like clunky waste of time. Finger tips aren't perfectly round, and the shape of these is basically round around your fingers so it just feels lame. I might have to go for the press on nails that people glue onto their nails because I need a more natural feel, as if it's part of my fingers, not some thimble stuck on them... in fact I think thimbles would be better than these things.	-1
I bought a set of these to try to learn some fingerpicking techniques, but I have to say I had a bear of a time trying to get them to fit properly, and they felt tight and uncomfortable on my fingers, even though my hands are pretty small.  It was a cool idea, but they should have made them out of a softer plastic where they fit around your fingers, and harder where the striking surface is.	-1
I got these to put on a fretless 4 that i preamped & thought it would give me a really smooth sound for a fretless. I cant say its all these strings fault but compared to the set of rounds or flats ive put on since there's no comparison ...personally i think they have a bad core or the coating is just too thick..you lose a ton of volume with these strings...there still sittin in the junk heap ....  Personally I wouldnt waste my $ on'em :/	-1
At first I really liked this cable. Coils well, doesn't tangle, solid connection. After a couple months of regular use (I play shows & rehearsals every week), it died without warning in the middle of a show. In fact, it died just after the return window closed with Amazon, so I contacted Planet Waves about their lifetime warranty. I was notified I'd have to ship it to them at my expense in order to get a replacement. Being that it would cost nearly as much to ship it as I'd paid in the first place, I decided to take the loss and move on. I've had good results using other Planet Waves products, but I won't be purchasing any more of their cables. Totally unreliable.	-1
The cable died on me in less than a month. Very disappointed in built quality.	-1
Bought two of these. Both failed at pretty much the same time, within a year. Both used in controlled conditions, on dry rehearsal rooms and stored carefully, they both actually look almost new, but don't work anymore. Save your money and look for something else.	-1
Second one I bought. Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. Went through two of these before I learned my lesson. Don't waste your money on this junk. I love Planet Waves stuff normally, but these are junk.	-1
After five months of light home use mine quit working.  It loses connection after being plugged into the guitar for a while.  Not worth ten cents.	-1
The jacks were bad from the minute I took them out of the box.  If you move the wrong way the sounds cracks and goes out.  Not a fan, but what should I have expected for a chord that was less than 10$	-1
cable shorted out after 1 month of light use	-1
I got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world.... after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead,,,	-1
Dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly. Will never buy again even if only 5 bucks	-1
This was bought based on the advice of others. I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.  It worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. It happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. After confirming the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.  D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. In my case, I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.  Again, this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good. The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. I don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. Well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.  So the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. I figure I'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, I may get it replaced. More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.  If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, I'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. IDK how much R&D it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. That would NOT make it a deal breaker.	-1
Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord. Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord.	-1
Guess anyone can get a bad cable. Just bought this and never got to use it cause anytime you moved it it lost connection. Looked like the molded ends would be good in the long run. I bought a 20' GLS audio cable that is working fine right now. My friend calls them Iron cables cause that's what they look like. It had the fabric like the old electric irons had back in the day. This cable feels cheap when you hold it. The diameter of the cable is rather small compared to some. Anyway I sent this one back in exchange for another one. Guess that will take about a month to get another bad one. 2nd one!!!! I sent the first one back cause it didn't work. Now the replacement one has stopped working. If you play for a living or in front of people you might want to buy a better cable. This one is sure to ruin your night if you don't have backup.	-1
This cable worked fine for a short while. I didn't put it through much abuse and the jack developed a break. The price was good and I have no complaints about it otherwise, but be wary of this jack design. There's no repairing it unless you buy a new jack and solder it yourself.	-1
Based on the number of positive reviews, I bought the 20ft right angle version of this product to use with my Fender Jazz bass.  When I received the cable, I was a little concerned about the light gauge and feel of the cable.. but hey, it got great reviews.. so why not?  I used the cable last night and my signal faded ... repeatedly.  I wiggled the cable and got the signal back, then it happened again.. no signal.  I pulled out several of my backup cables and tried them all and had no loss of signal or cut-off.  I tried this cable again.  Same loss of signal.  I'm returning this cable, as I can't even recommend this product as a backup cable since it is unreliable.	-1
Ukulele ad on Amazon states that this ukulele has "smooth fret ends"; all the fret ends on both sides of the neck were sharp enough to cut. I could have smoothed them down with considerable work but the other issue with this uke killed the sale. The ukulele definitely was never "Inspected and adjusted in the USA by a skilled technician".  Skilled technician?  An amateur uke player could easily see the problems with this instrument. The nut width shown on all online specifications for the Oscar Schmidt OU2 ukulele show a 1 1/2" nut width.  That extra bit of width makes it far easier to play.  The ukulele I received had a 1 3/8" width which is nothing special when it comes to a ukulele nut width. I have returned the uke.	-1
This cable is of very poor quality.  Constant buzzing, and loss of sound depending on the angle of the cable.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I have both the 20 ft cable and several 6 foot cables. There is a BIG volume loss when using the 20 foot cable. I expected some loss, but this is almost to the point of being unacceptable.  If my amp is normally at 2 (out of 10), I have to crank it to 4 or 5 with this one plugged in to get the same volume.	-1
These are well made and they arrived quickly , but they will not fit JBL which seems to have sabotaged their speaker mounts so you must buy JBL stands.	-1
Well I guess when 2 or 4 strings are good so that should be about 2 stars.  The E string is dead with NO sustain and the A string broke about 5 minutes after I tuned it up, just sitting in the guitar stand.  There is truth in sticking to what you know.  Never had the problem with Ernie Ball and that's what I going to replace these junkie strings with.  I absolutely recommend you buy something else.	-1
I have no idea what bass these will fit on.  I tried to use them on a Hofner Beatle bass, and the blue fabric at the end of the strings was going to end up in the nut.  So I had to send them back.  Don't buy these unless the scale of your bass is about two inches shorter than that of a short scale violin bass.	-1
I used Rotosound strings for years and always found them to be very good, but, this set came with a dead E string.  I'm very disappointed.  I guess I'll go to D'Addario from now on!!	-1
These bend out of shape easier then other brands for some reason so be careful if you have thick strings and play hard	-1
Alas, this unit arrived with a broken leg adjuster. Upon investigating further, it appeared to be a design (as opposed to manufacturing) flaw, so I opted to get my money back.	-1
My guitars are very expensive and this hook is of good quality but the rest of the assembly is cheap. Wood base is really light weight and the sheet rock screws are a joke. I can't see me hanging my Strat or Martin to this .	-1
It does its job, however I don't like the fact that you can't get the color of wood you want. I now have all ebony wood in my house and the guitar holder outlier. I actually asked the buyer for the darker wood version.	-1
This pick holder sticks up too high on my guitar. I prefer those that are flat rather than ergonomically rounded.	-1
Two stars because it does what it was designed to do. Minus three stars because it is too hard, inflexible and therefore very uncomfortable. As a matter of fact, the strap is inclined to cut into your shoulders while wearing which is particularly troubling if you have a heavy guitar. I could not wear it at all after a while so opted to simply invest in a padded leather strap, (considerably more expensive but well worth the investment.)	-1
thanks	-1
Hated it.  Really, really stiff.  Not flexible enough.	-1
if you don't fill it up all the way, the picks start to fall off	-1
Junk.	-1
Arrived in pieces. Not useable.	-1
Didn't last 6 months. Developed a crackle/short under light usage.	-1
i found this item to exspensive for just one i hope that the people selling this would atleast make it a two pack	-1
Seems sturdy enough, but the yellow is much brighter than in the picture. Doesn't look 'tweed'. Looks more like you play for Stryper, which is probably NOT what you're going for if you order this.	-1
Awful, second one I bought and became defective within less than 3 days of normal use. I have straight ones I've not had a problem with, but these L shaped ones just seem to go to cr@p right away. Don't buy this garbage.	-1
The cheap leather ends will scratch your guitar. If that doesn't bother you..go for it.	-1
Terrible design. The picks fly out like confetti when all you want is one pick. They have another model that is bigger. That one works better. This one is useless. Can't believe I bought two of em. Save your money.	-1
I love Planet Waves. They are cheap and decently durable. They aren't top quality and will eventually wear out, probably faster than more expensive ones but they will a while.

Terrible in every way...  Stiff as a board, yet still somehow manages to get all tangled.  Scrapes up my neck.  But the worst part is all that tangling already resulted in having my strap button screw stripped out.  I'm so frustrated with this piece of crap I can't believe how bad it is.  Not that this strap was that expensive but I've had much better results with cheaper straps.	-1
Ugly and cheap looking in real life.	-1
The Dunlop strap slips on  shoulder. Very useless for someone who holds guitar neck up high. It's suitable for lightweight acoustic guitar, not a heavy electric.	-1
This is great if you love losing all your picks! I may have received a dud but my picks fall out when I hang my guitar or lay it down. The tension on the spring is so loose. Even when I load it up with picks it's loose. I'm going to try to adjust it when I get time but I was not happy with mine. Luckily, it was just an add-on item. I know you will occasionally get the one dud and other customers may have had better luck. I usually do not ask for a refund or stir up a stink over a low cost item and I won't on this purchase. I'll make it work somehow. Just be aware that you may have the same experience.	-1
I agree, worthless. You can put them in -- but if you have short nails like I do, no way to get them out. Worthless.  Would give it zero stars if I could. Save your money.	-1
After 3 months, this cabel has developed a fatal short. It's unusable. The Amazon dealer won't take it back. Now I have to see if it's worth chasing the manufacturer for a return or replacement.  UPDATE: due to the great price on this cable, I bought another. After 5 months it is now shorting out. I will now spend about half of what it's worth sending it back to D'Addario to try to cash in on the 'lifetime guarantee'.	-1
Cable broke.	-1
You get what you paid, at first works fine, but after light use (4 or 5 months) at home, begins to fail, dark and muddy sound, scratch noise, until no sound seems to be have very fragile the inner wire.  Maybe for static use works I mean to patch some equipment, but for guitar doesn't work, get a better cable.	-1
Stiff leather and hard uncomfortable trap. I gave up putting strap locks on these and bough another brand strap.	-1
Holds maybe six picks.  Not worth the money, obviously.	-1
Stupid item, its huge with a folded metal 'spring' that takes up all the room inside. You can put one pick in it!!! Might as well just put an extra pick between the strings up top as usual.  Bought 2, threw them both out so people won't think i'm a moron.	-1
Cheap and does not hold many picks less if you use thicker ones. Hard to get picks out too.	-1
The Dunlop 5005 pick holder works much better. The picks fall out of this particular holder.	-1
TL;DR: Started cutting out within very few uses, and you don't want that to happen to you: get something else.  I bought this and Planet Waves' upscale "Custom Series" cable, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002H09OS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage, at the same time, to compare.  Neither had been used much before this one started cutting out.  It lasted through a few sessions at home; it was never gigged.  I bought a Planet Waves Custom Series cable http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002H09OS?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 at the same, to compare the two.  That one still works, but I'm not a big fan of them either.	-1
It's large and there's a big difference in flexiblity between the metal tip/edge and the plastic body. You might like it if you're going for the tone of a metal pick on metal strings, but I think there are better choices if you're going for speed and accuracy.	-1
work but too tight for me	-1
I'm so disappointed with this cable. I've purchased hundreds of Planet Waves products over the course of my career, and I've never encountered something like this. The cable already doesn't work. Maybe I got a lemon, but I definitely want a replacement.	-1
Holds picks but doesn't stick well	-1
OK sound. Failed in 1 month, upgraded to Mogami GOLDS and never had a problem since.	-1
I've bought a bunch of these over the last few years and 75% of them have gone bad within 2 years.  They simply don't last.  Get something better.	-1
Horrible. I've had 2 fail after just a few months. Save up for better cables.	-1
Was working great for about 2 months before it suddenly stopped giving me sound when plugged in. I had to rotate the cable jack about until I had sound coming out of my amp. I have several Planet Waves patch cables, one custom series cable (Had it for close to 3 years) and more recently, the American Stage series. So far none have failed me this badly. My suggestion? Just get the Custom Series or American Stage cables if you're gonna buy Planet Waves.	-1
I know, I know...you get what you pay for. However, I thought I'd get more than a few uses from them. Gentle home use, nothing more. I didn't pull on it or step on it but within days it started buzzing. I tried the spare and after a few days it started with the crackling too.  They were cheap enough to not go through the headache of trying to get my money back for this trash. Avoid these sorry cables. I wish I could give it zero stars.	-1
worked ok for a couple of uses then stopped working on me, love their more premium cables and wanted to try these but disappoint, love other products from this brand though.	-1
So like most people I got this Bc of good reviews so my cable arrived and I plug in and it's already buzzing so it was a broken cable didn't even last a day it says  guaranteed for life I want my money back don't waist your money on this	-1
Just spend a couple bucks more On a better cable. Don't be cheap when it comes to cables. Buy good quality cables that have life time warranty. Like monster.	-1
