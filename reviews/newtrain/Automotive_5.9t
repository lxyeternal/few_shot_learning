I wanted to darken up the front windows in my work van, without dropping a bunch of . This was perfect for the application. I took me 2 tries to get it on good, so it might behoove you to buy 2 boxes. 1 box was exactly enough to do a Chrysler minivan. After being on for about a month, the haze has finally gone away. But I couldn't get a couple bubbles on the bottom to go away. Professional tint can usually be shrunk with heat gun to help rid those last couple bubbles, this tint will not shrink under a heat gun so you gotta work it!	1
Works perfectly.  My wife actually used this to tint the rear windows of the Parent-mobile darker (Subaru Forester) so that our little man doesn't have sun glaring in his face.  This is a more elegant solution than the screens, more subtle, and looks good.  She found a great YouTube tutorial on installing and on her second try, made it look like it was professionally installed!  We just wish there was a *bit* more in the roll.  For our particular application, there was just enough for 2 rear windows.  If there'd been any unforeseeable incidents that required extra cutting, you'd readily only have enough material for one window.  From the inside it looks good.  From the outside, you can't really tell it's not OEM.	1
Fit right on on hassle and no more  missing at hi speed,  less than half the price that you would pay here in Canada	1
I bought these to replace my stock coils on my Monte Carlo.  They worked great at first and then 4 months down the road I had misfires.  I did extensive troubleshooting to include my O2 sensors since I doubted a brand new coil could go bad in such a short time.  I replaced all sparks and wires, then I eventually tried putting on my old stock coils.  At that point I found a nice corrosion mark on the ignition control module right beneat one of the coils.  The coil started firing through the bottom rather than through the post.  I would suggest only buying these if you are looking for a temporary performance fix, but not if you plan to keep your car running for the long haul.	-1
Works great! Engine seems to run much smoother now!	1
does what it needs to do. looks nice, and haven't had any misfires	1
as descibed	1
Cool	1
Very good oil and works well in my Harley Davidson Ultra. Have used it in the engine since new and no issues.	1
Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50 Synthetic Motor Oil for Motorcycle is great synthetic oil for your bike and the price is very competitive.	1
Bought this for our 2003 BMW R 1150R.  Even as a female I understand that Mobil 1 is THE standard for synthetic, and we would never buy another brand for any of our engines.	1
well i have been using ams oil for ever with excellent results,however im sick of really over paying for oil.not to mention i can buy moble 1 at wally world or any place they sell oil	1
I used this in a bike years ago but have had trouble finding it on store shelves for whatever reason. Walmart always had like 1 or 2 quarts, but that's it, I don't know why. At Autoparts stores the price was so high I just avoided it. SO, I stopped using it. Well, time goes by and I found a good deal on Syn3 so ran that till its gone....and was looking for a quality product to replace it. With the current rebate, this is a good deal so bought some at a fair price.	1
This is the only oil I've used in my Harley's for many many years.  It does what it's designed to do and it does it very well.  Great stuff.	1
Purchased for 1986 Ford Ranger 2.9 V6  I had a standard replacement coil installed for the last year.  Was experiencing an uneven idle and mediocre acceleration. I installed the coil and a new connector. The idle smoothed out, the acceleration improved noticeably.  I have always used Motorcraft Platinum Plugs.  A year ago I installed new cap, wires, etc.  I know the coil was well worth the money spent. Technology has improved in the years since the engine was first designed.  It was an easy installation. Taking less than 5 minutes. Use a 5.5 mm socket, same size as the ignition module on the side of the distributor, to remove and install the coil.  I also, spliced and soldiered in a new connector.  Also from Amazon.	1
Two thumbs up !!	1
I've had this for a couple of months so far so good .I have it installed on my 94 F250 5.8 truck, Hope it lasts longer that the MSD Ignition 8227 Blaster TFI Coil which left me walking not once but twice.	1
Fits good, and as part of a tune up made a huge difference to how well the truck runs. Gained a few miles per gallon.	1
GooD!	1
Use V-Twin oil because it doesn't have any synthetic lubricants which can cause clutch slippage in motorcycles. Been using this for years and it works great.	1
Good	1
I installed these myself and they were not as hard to handle. Just be sure to do the tinting in a clean space.	1
hight quality protuct.. GILA video lessons not enought.. the most car windows needs dryer to install well	1
I bought this as a performance upgrade to my vechile.  It was easy to install and works great.  My vechile starts easily and I can feel the quick response to throttle movement.	1
Another perfect "plug and go" product!	1
Serious spark.  Really exceeds the factory unit.	1
loved it	1
Better than stock and look good ,coil wire is snug never fell out.	1
Arrived super fast. Took 10 minutes to put it in. No instructions come with the box so just be safe and disconnect your negative battery terminal.  As for performance, there is a definate change. I can't say I feel more power, but the idle is smoothed out and when I get on it, there is no more dips in the power band like there was before and they were very noticeable. I am running the MSD 8.5mm Superconductors wires and the copper plugs. My Bronco scoots great now. Just a smooth pull all the way to redline.  Awesome product.	1
As described, satisfied.	1
just installed this nice piece on my 1995 Ford Mustang GT took like 10 minutes to install and looks great!! I have been driving around problem free for about a week and a half now car starts up faster nicer and my fuel economy seems like its way better! definitely recommend this part weather your looking for a replacement or performance piece or even to add a little cover to the engine bay!	1
Fires just like it should and was a great upgrade over stock! Car starts up a bit fast and runs a bit quicker!	1
My MSD coil is eleven or so years old, my car wasn't starting, and I tracked it down to the coil. In went the Accel and my Cobra fired up with a roar. FWIW, the Accel coil weighs about twice as much as its MSD counterpart.  (downside: Yellow? REALLY??? Accel, consider, maybe, red parts.)	1
I have a 1992 Ford Thunderbird.  It started having a little miss and lacked power.  So I added this coil to my tune-up parts list. It did the job, car runs great & power is back.	1
I purchased this for mu 96 E150 Econoline van which recently turned 100k miles. I ad done a tuneup few years ago, but had not replaced the coil. After replacing the coil, I noticed improved performance, and great pickup. Great product and very competitive price wrt auto parts store, and highly recommend. Shipment came free and on time as expected	1
I bought this along with matching Accel wires, rotor, and coil for my 1991 Ford F150 to replace my ancient Motorcraft ones. Fit and quality are good, though the coil-cap connector is a little different than OEM - not a big deal if you get the Accel wire set as they come with two coil-cap wires: one for this coil and one for the OEM coil. My truck runs much better now. Recommended.	1
Awesome replacement for my screaming eagle heavy breather at less than half the cost. I think it looks better too.	1
Fast shipping, quality product.	1
K&N makes a great product and if you want to increase your fuel mileage this is an easy way to do it!!	1
I have used Mobil 1 on all my vehicle's for years and after buying a new to me, HD 2010 ultra Limited was pleased to see the they also made the V-twin moil 1 for it. I call them to ask what makes this a better product than the OEM oil that HD sell's and they explained that it is specially formulated to meet or exceed the requirement need with air cooled HD engineers as well as trans and primary case requirements. I believe that they manufacture a superior product and will be only running it on my bike.	1
You may not look cooler,but your engine will thank you in the long run.  I only use Mobil 1 V-twin in my hog.	1
Expensive but works. Keeps my moto cooler in the summer months and is readily available even in most auto parts.	1
Its oil what else can you say other than what's in title asd asd asd asd asd asd asd as dasd asd asd	1
Having bought a new Harley I wanted to use  a top notch oil for my high performance engine. My bike came with the Harley syn3 already in it from the factory. So when I did my 1st oil change (at 300 miles, did not want to wait until 1,000 miles) I decided to go with this product based on a ton of research and reviews I did on line. So far it has performed flawlessly. The real test will be how it works over time, but as of right now I plan to keep using this. And I am the type of person that will change the oil and filter in my bike more often than most, at least twice as often as recommended.	1
I have not yet used this product but needed to change my oil soon. Great value for the money. I cannot purchase locally for this money.	1
It is good tint but it is difficult to install. The small strips mean you have to line up about 6-8 maybe even 10 strips to cover your back window. It is next to impossible to line them up perfectly, I could not do it and returned it. You will either have them overlapped or a space between them, both look terrible.  Recommend having the rear window done by the pros, but doing the side windows yourself with Gila tint.	-1
great product east to install very very dark tint I used the tint on my home windows and it worked just as well. very happy	1
I use this oil in my Fountain Powerboat. I read where other high performance boaters claimed a drop in oil temperature with the V-Twin oil. I experienced a 5 degree drop in oil temperature along with a few pound increase in oil pressure over the 25w-40 "factory" synthetic oil. I'll continue using this oil and would recommend it to others for high performance applications.	1
Great pack to change fluids on my Harley FLH.  Great to have one kind of oil to change engine oil, primary and transmission.  Use M1 full-syn in all my vehicles.	1
Mobil1 is what I use in my cars and truck, so it made perfect sense to me to use it in my bike too. It's great quality, and more readily available than some other high-end brands.	1
Purchased case of 6 oil for the changing of the oil on the bike.  The cost was good enough to buy 6 and have it shipped then it was to buy locally and pay the cost of the taxes and price shop for oil  No complaints	1
Been using a synthetic V twin oil by vavoline for a couple of oil changes in my 2011 VN1700 Classic. Always found myself needing to change it before 3000 miles due to it getting to dirty. So I ordered this oil back in March this year and finally did the oil change after my engine kept stalling out due to dirty oil. I cannot believe how cool my engine runs now. It's also quieter and the radiator fan doesn't even kick on after riding so far (that's how cool the oil keeps my engine). Hopefully I can see past 3000 miles oil changes with this oil.	1
I only use Mobil 1 in my motorcycles and this was a bargain.  Great oil at a great price.  Shipped easy, on time, and in perfect condition.	1
The life of an engine depends on Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50 Synthetic Motor Oil for Motorcycles to prevent friction which causes heat.  You can get along without it but you will get along by foot.	1
Mobil 1 was promptly delivered as promised.  Works well in my Harley engine.  In fact, the idle speed has slightly increased maybe due to this oil and less friction compared to non synthetic oils. Longer term, I think that the oil will do fine as it is formulated for air cooled motorcycle engines and the extra heat and demands on the engines.   The oil rebate was submitted but it takes a long time to receive it (4-6 weeks).  Not sure, but I could have gotten the same price on this oil at the local auto parts discount store.	1
Harley Davidson's love this stuff!  Fully synthetic, refined motor oil from a quality manufacturer. I only use Mobil 1, in all my cars (3) and my motorcycle.  Everything seems to run smoother, quieter and more efficiently with Mobil 1.  Not sure what else to say, probably worth checking the Mobil 1 website or more info.	1
I've been hotrodding for 40 + years. I have found most oil are good but if you want the best for your best toys ,use Mobil 1.	1
Very good product is designed with high warm, I recommend it for use in 100% satisfied with the product purchased thanks.	1
They work great.  I was in the AAP and found some Griots garage sponges then saw these for half price.  They are the perfect size for putting on plastic and tire dressing.  The curved end made getting into tight spots easy.	1
I do not like the design of these particular brand tire swipes.  The reason being is, you may be fine with the curve in the applicator if you have smaller tires.  However, if your vehicle has larger tires, these swipes are more of a burden than a helpful resource. It slowed me down considerably as I found they required more pressure to distribute the gel evenly across the surface of the tire.  Another drawback to this also means due to the pressure required and "drag" across the tire that these "break down" much quicker than others i've used.  I own my own automotive detailing business and while the concept of the swipe as a product is excellent, I would lean more towards a uniformed surface foam applicator as they save time and have better overall distribution of the tire gel.	-1
I've used Eagle One Tire Swipes for a number of years.  They are a high quality long lasting material.  The key is to use the tire swipes when the tires are as clean as possible so that you don't clog up the applicators with a lot of dirt and grime.  It's my favorite applicator for putting dressings on tires.  I'm using DuPont Tire Shine while my supply lasts.  It's perfect to use with the tire swipes.	1
The picture on this item was a bit confusing, it didn't look like the current labels for Mobil-1 VTwin 20-50 but the quarts that arrived were good.	1
You can use this oil in for the engine oil, primary, and transmission in Harley's.  My Streetglide seems to run cooler using this full synthetic compared to the dyno oils.  With Mobil 1 you cant go wrong.  It is a high quality oil and a good price.  A lot cheaper than royal purple.	1
Best price for this item anywhere.  A must have for your bike if you do your own work.  Will purchase again in a few months.	1
I had been using an Amsoil 10-40 synthetic in V-Star 1100 and it seemed OK, but the gear changes weren't the best. When I had the bike in for service, they changed the oil and when I got it back, the clutch felt like it was slipping and the engine was noisier then usual. I'm assuming they put a convectional Yamalube oil. So I used this Mobil-1 20-50 VTwin oil. OMG! I never thought oil would make such a noticeable difference, but it was instant. The bike ran cooler, quieter and the shifts were crisp and smooth. The 50 weight looks like molasses coming out, but works great in a v-twin. Highly recommend.	1
I have a 2012 Ultra with an air cooled 103 cubic inch V-twin engine. These engines are set to EPA specs from the factory, and consequently run fairly hot. When the bike is in motion the oil cooler does a good enough job, but at low speeds or stopped in traffic the oil temps go way up. Heat is the biggest enemy of an air cooled engines oil. Heat causes the oil to break down and then the engine doesn't get circulating lubrication. The first damage shows up in the cylinder heads from lack of oil. This damage can happen quite quickly on a hot day and is very expensive to fix. I have found the best answer is Mobile 1 V-Twin Synthetic in 20-50. This motor oil has very high thermal resistance and will continue its circulating lucubration when other oils have broken down due to heat. Harley Engines are very expensive to repair so take all precautions available. The Harley Syn-3 oil is NOT the answer, although your dealer will want to sell their HD branded oil. Always use a 100% synthetic oil, and the best synthetic is Mobil-1 V-Twin.	1

My bike is a 1987 Honda Shadow VT700C with 76,000+ miles on it.  I have been using Mobil-1 oil in it since I bought it new 25 years ago.  When it was new, I used 5W30, at about 50,000 miles I switched to 10W40, and last oil change I went to Mobil-1 high mileage.  Still the engine clatter seemed to be getting worse.  So I was looking for some Mobil-1 20W50 oil, which is also recommended in the owner's manual for hot climates.  When I saw this V-Twin Mobil-1 20W50, I whistled at the price - fifteen bucks for a single quart -- two or three times the cost of regular Mobil-1 oil. Still, maybe that was what I needed for my aging engine.  So I bought case of 6 for sixty bucks - which works out to ten bucks a quart.  Later I saw WalMart also carries this, and it comes in two grades - regular for about eight bucks, and advanced for about ten bucks.  What Amazon.com is selling is the Advanced grade, and the price is comparable to WalMart, and no taxes, plus free shipping.  I am very impressed with this engine oil.  Engine clatter has all but disappeared.  The bike sounds and runs much better.  It is pricey oil, but it is worth it.  I would heartily recommend this oil for any v-twin, and especially for all aging older engines, V-twin or otherwise.	1
Changed oil in my HD and noticed it ran smoother right off the bat. The best thing is the shifting is alot better. I had a problem when going from first to second and going in to neutral,always embarrassing. A thousand miles on this oil change and has not happend since. In my opinion its worth the extra couple of dollars per oil change.	1
Mobil 1 has a history of being a quality product, I would not use an alternate oil for my Harley.	1
Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50  I was skeptical about using this oil in my Ducati 696 at first, because the manual had specified 15W-50 and many other riders wanted me to use a 10W-40 instead. Many of them claimed that the 20W-50 was designed for slow revving Harley-Davidsons with true V-Twins instead of the somewhat higher revving L-Twins from Ducati.  I had clutch slippage with Rotella T6 5W-40, so I tried the M1 V-Twin 20W-50 because it is the only over the counter synthetic xW-50 JASO MA-compliant oil I can find outside the realm of boutique Motorcycle-specific oils from Motul or Silkolene at nearly double the price.  The V-Twin 20W-50 is fairly thick out of the bottle, and my 696's engine starts up with a slow lumbering attitude and sound. I contacted Mobil to make sure they would recommend it, and they stated that the V-Twin 20W-50 was the correct oil to use in my 696. Once on the road, I didn't hear/feel anything wrong. WOT 9000 RPM upshifts were clean and precise. The datalogs I got from my Ducati Data Acquisition did not show any RPM spikes, and I did not hear the cat-like screeches after an upshift.  As for the high-revving engine comment earlier, I looked up Buell's 1125 and Aprilia's RSV4 engine oil requirements. They both called for 15W-50, and Amsoil's catalog showed recommendations for 20W-50. The 1125 and RSV4 are by no means low revving engines, they can rev higher than most of Ducati's engines which are already fairly high at 9k-11k RPM.  Overall: 5/5 stars, great oil to use if your bike needs 15W-50.	1
When I had my HD I switched to Mobile 1 from Syn 3 and noticed it ran cooler and less internal valve clatter.  I recently bought a BMW boxer and also run Mobile 1.  Since BMW has a dry clutch I use regular Mobile 1 15/50, not concerned about not having anti shearing properties in V twin oil.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mobil-1-V-Twin-Motorcycle-20W50-Motor-Oil-1-Quart-Pack-of-6/dp/B000SKV4T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mobil 1 V-Twin Motorcycle 20W50 Motor Oil - 1 Quart, (Pack of 6)</a>	1
Nice looking gauge very accurate from autometer but no wiring with this kit ??? Come on.	1
works great ,nice quality	1
Works as designed	1
As pictured	1
It is very easy to install and looks real nice. I put it in my 1969 camaro and it works well so far, I have had it for about 6 months now and no trouble	1
perfect they work great	1
Great for spreading shine on black tires to make my ride look badass	1
Both tire swipes separated within a few uses.	-1
Others have said they tear easy, and they do if your not a little careful how you use them. I bought these at the beginning of summer and only used one of them on both my vehicles all summer and it just started tearing on one corner. I also don't feel the need to clean these when done, I just put them in a plastic grocery sack when done.	1
Meh it sucks	-1
Essential to wipe away excess tire shine. Using this sponge actually saves me on the shine as I can evenly distribute the liquid across the tire.	1
Works great for applying tire dress!  Nice and big!	1
This is the easiest way to put on tire or trim dressing. Love them	1
I used to use a folded microfiber cloth to apply tire protectant, but it's a bit of a hassle to keep hold of, and getting into the bead area is trickier than it needs to be. I saw a package of these locally, and thought I'd see if they worked better. I found it much easier to apply tire dressing to the whole sidewall, and it went on faster as well. I use 303 protectant, which leaves a matte finish and dries to the touch pretty quickly. I'm sure these would work well with any liquid or gel tire shine. The black foam could be a little stiffer, but I didn't see any wear after 4 tires, and if they only last a few months, replacing them certainly won't break the bank.	1
I rarely get a product that makes such a differance. The engine idles better and just plain runs smoother throughout the RPM range. In the transmission, the shifting is much smoother too. My HD Sportster loves it. If you are thinking about using this oil then I can say you won't regret it. I sure don't!	1
I have used this oil in my 05 Roadking, my 07 E/glide and now in my 2011 Heritage Classic. I use this in all 3 "boxes" It shifts well and quiets motor down and runs cooler. I have used "dino" oil and Amsoil, this is my choice for performance. Price on Amazon fair and shipped to my door in a timely fashion, also K&N oil filters avail here, chrome twin cam is 171C, top quality filter and has a nut on the end to wrench off with a socket, no filter wrench needed	1
If you drive an air cooled V-Twin H-D or other make, this this in my opinion the best stuff.  When I'm stuck in traffic feeling the heat coming off my air-cooled engine, I feel confident knowing this stuff performs very well at high temperatures. It also helps keep the motor, at least what it seems, a little cooler than the others.  For my bike I would trust SYN3 and Mobil 1, but my first choice is Mobil 1. I don't trust AMSOIL enough to put it in my engine. Here is why.  First, AMSOIL 20W50 is not API certified and may void my warranty.  The AMSOIL website says its 20W50 meets API requirements, but this doesn't mean it's API certified. If you go to the API website and check AMSOIL, only 8 of their oils are certified, 20W50 is not on the list.  Second, I don't trust their multi-level-marketing (MLM) network. Why does this matter? Well, they have literally thousands of distributors.  Chances are, if you are reading a blog about how well AMSOIL performs, a "news" article, product review, comparison, etc., you can most likely trace the source of all these resources  (or get directed towards) an AMSOL distributor sponsored website.  Even most of the positive AMSOIL posts on discussion boards are pretty much spam promoting the product. Hence, most of the great reviews I've read are not really reviews.  I would be very interested to see a quality product review tested by an independent.  As for the H-D SYN3, this is comparable to M1, but because it says H-D on the box, you're gonna pay more for what I believe is at best on par with the Mobil 1. Screamin' Eagle SYN3 is manufactured by Citgo.  I heard a rumor on the H-D boards that Harley-Davidson could not strike a deal with Mobil because Mobil would not remove their name from the package.  Mobile 1, just like SYN3, is also approved to lubricate the primary/tranny (in my case, the same compartment), but I've heard mixed thoughts on this.  Right now I do have M1 in the primary/tranny with no issues, but am looking at alternatives.  However, I'm 100% sold on using M1 as the first choice for my motor.	1
Over 82K on a 07 FLHTCUI without a hiccup.  Perfect 6 qt carton (4qts motor-1qt tranny-1qt clutch).  Change my own fluids so I get lazy sometimes and go as long as 7K between oil changes but this oil protects like no other.  Tried the HD brand syn Screaming Eagle oil and it sucks to high heaven.  Don't buy into the Harley hype it's not worth the money you are spending.  Best oil on the market.	1
Great!	1
V-twin big bore engines kick the crap out of oil since they are commonly air cooled and the oil is running the tranny as well.  This oil came in second only to Amsoil in performance testing for half the price.  Unless you are racing/dragging your bike, this is all you would ever need.  I put it into my 06 Yamaha RS Warrior and it quieted the transmittion down nicely!  Did not think oil would do that or have that effect but it sure did!  I read all I could before buying this oil and it was superior to any Harley or Yamahalube or other name brand oil out there.  From what I read, dino oil just cannot take the abuse V twins give it with heat, RPM's and functioning in the tranny as well so spend a few more bucks and do it right.  Change it less frequently as well!	1
After switching to Mobil 1 in my 2009 Sportster, I'm sold. Oil temps dropped immediately and noticeably. The engine starts faster, runs smoother. I'm sold.	1
I used Mobile 1 in my 06 Road King. I also ordered the filter from Amazon so it makes it easier.	1
This is the Only oil I use in my Dyna Street Bob since 2008, Engine runs cooler, Shifts Great, Here in Florida as you all know it gets mighty Hot. This is the only Oil I will ever use in my Bikes.	1
After a few cycles using the HD SYN3 oil, I decided to change my own oil and use this Mobil 1 in the engine.  Having never been satisfied with the "just after the oil change feeling" with SYN3, there was a noticeable improvement in engine smoothness and reduction in engine noise during the next 2,500 miles I kept this oil in the bike.  These are things you notice when you become connected to your bike, as you fellow bikers know.  I have used Mobil 1 since because of this experience and because I can get it from Amazon cheap.  It's probably not as good as AIMSOIL, but it's very good and I'm confident it's doing a great job.	1
My girlfriend and I both have Yamaha 650, yr. 2002 and have been useing Mobil 1 after the 600 mile break in. She has 55,000 miles on her bike and I 34,000 mi. We both did the oil changes every 7-8000 miles (was told we can do this with this oil) until 2 years ago. Thats when I did last oil change. I only put on 2300 miles but she did 16,000 miles. Tomorrow I will change both bike oils. My oil looks yellow and hers a dark brown. Only reason I am changing oil is the 2 years since and oil filter,not knowing moisture build up or breakdown in the oil in 2 years. Both bikes run perfect, just like out of the factory. Dave	1
no issues	1
Most durable and pleasant to use. Great value.	1
Nice size and contour for reg sized tires not sure for low profile and big truck tires. Priced right	1
Extremely disappointed by this purchase. I accidentally ordered the "2 pack" for 8.50 or so, instead of the "pack of 6" which happened to be 7.50. I didn't figure it would be a problem because I thought I was getting more than the other. HOWEVER, the more expensive one is just two applicators....for MORE money than the 6 pack. Needless to say I will be contacting the seller. Will post an update if anything comes of it.	-1
It's sized perfectly if you're a little girl or an Elf.  I didn't even open the package, just sent it back.  Ended up with a real 2.25" billiard ball, drilled out.  Enough said.	-1
Ordered this thinking it would fit my Hurst short shifter on my 91 Mustang GT, hasty purchase lead to me realizing that this is a 3/8 thread and I needed 7/16 20...Which I have not yet been able to find on amazon. My return time expired before I put it on the car (its a project so a shifter knob is not high priority to put on) so I've got one to give to someone!	1
I'm a professional Detailer and I purchased these a few months ago and these Eagle One Tire Swipes work great. The small convexed design allows for the best control wile applying any type of tire dressing to anything with tires quickly. I recommend them greatly, I'm actually going to buy more right now.	1
I picked these up at a auto parts store recently. As I tried 1 out, at 1st it was fine. After using it on the 2nd tire, the soft foam separated from the stiff (yellow) foam handle. I wasn't applying much pressure as I was using it. At the regular price of 2.5-4$, these would be overpriced for some cheap quality/non durable, foam tire applicators. A person is better off using a solid 1 piece applicator pad or a tire brush to apply tire dressing.  You can get at Wally World two 4" round microfiber applicator pads for around $2, or A tire brush for 2-6$.	-1
Great for applying tire shine gel.  The contoured sponge follows the sidewall profile of the tire and prevents waste. I use a disposable glove so my hand doesn't get messy with the tire shine liquid/gel.	1
much easier than spraying on then having to clean off the rims from overspray. they cover the whole sidewall evenly.	1
Caused $800 in warranty damage to Impala. Stay away	-1
Worked like it was suppose to.	1
Great product	1
Certainly the best out there. Was tired of spending 15$ each time for air filters over the years. I drive approx 18k miles a year and needed something that lasts! Certainly felt the increase in pick up and also getting slightly higher mileage. Def recommend!	1
I love these K&Ns.  They always increase my gas mileage by about 10-15%.  I always get a little nervous about the extra dirt that blows by, but I haven't had any problems.  yet!	1
I freaking love this Filter. I order this for my Mitsubishi eclipse 2003 and fits perfectly. I also notice that my gas don't burn that fast.  This filter make your car breath more air. That means more air less gas.	1
This filter is amazing. I no longer need to keep changing my filter. I will be saving soo much money.	1
fast shipping!!! good price!!! looks great!!!!	1
Makes my boat go faster.	1
good	1
Thanks Hurst. looks great in my 67 Camaro	1
This might work ok on a car engine, but it's almost useless on a small engine.  I've tried using it on snowmobile engines and on souped up Briggs motors with small Mikuni's.  You have to almost close off the restrictor in order to get a vacuum reading, and once you do that it bogs the engine down so much you have to take it off to keep it from dying.	-1
Edelbrock used to stand for quality.  The old man must be turning over in his grave that such poor quality is being sold under his name.  Looks like it was made by third graders in China using rocks.	-1
I was a little worried that it wouldnt fit my Mazda 6s but this was a perfect fit. Shifting is so much smoother than the Razo I used to have. The white ball really stands out and gives it a bit of a sporty look. Nice $30 mod.	1
A Hurst product that has trouble finding my address, a Hot Rod must.	1
We used this panel for a turbo installation (see videos on youtube under redonkilaus).  The panel holds the boost gauge, and the air/fuel mixture gauge, perfectly.  We mounted it below the ashtray in our 1997 Toyota 4Runner, so it looks like a professional installation and is easy to see.	1
simple and effective inside the glove box, comes with the mounting hardware. in my BRZ I have two of these and a few gauges, my water-methanol kit and can fit 4 gauges with room to spare for license, insurance and registration!	1
The unit arrived exactly as described in the Edelbrock 4025 picture. I received it today and was already successful in syncing my 2 carbs  (34 PDSIT2/3) on my 72' VW bus. It lacks the build quality of my original English one that I had in the 80's but it works just as well. The manometer tube is plastic within the cast metal (zinc?) column. Obviously the column needs to be folded up vertical when in use. It folds down nicely for storing back in it's cheap paper box and bubble wrap.	1
Exactly what I wanted and expected, thank you for the fast and friendly service!	1
the right tool for the job	1
Works great!  I've owned several over the years, and other than the tube now being made of plastic rather than glass, the quality hasn't changed much.	1
Amazon was the only place that I could find this type of panel.  Exactly what I was looking for.	1
Used it to sync the carbs on my MG. Now it runs a lot better!	1
Good product, great price	1
Works good and its cheap.  Great for hobbies but professionals might want something else. You can tell build quality has gone down since old German units, but it serves it purpose. I would buy again if I lost this one.	1
Works great for syncing dual carburators, also will work on side draft carbs. I have no complaints.	1
Awesome	1
This Uni-Syn was exactly as described, the photo is exactly as it came. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it does not say Edelbrock anywhere on the device and the instructions look like a photo copy of an old instruction.  Pros Worked very well to balance my Datsun 240z carbs Seems to be well made Good price Amazed that I could still find this Very compact Easy to Adjust  Cons There is no numbers on the float tube Made in Taiwan (Expected American made Edelbrock) The float seems a bit cheap but it does what it should	1
I gave this a 5 star rating because Unisyn makes a quality product. I bought this to replace one I had years ago. If you are buying this because it says Edelbrock, it's a Unisyn repackaged in a Edelbrock box.	1
Great fit and performance. Easy to clean once dirty with the manufacturers cleaner and oiler. All my cars use a K+N filter.	1
Extremely easy to fit. Spent some extra time, cleaning bay and then drove gently around for 10 minutes. Put foot down to overtake a stopping car and my ol' Grand Cherokee nearly leapt out of its skin! Best $$$ per HP increase around :-)	1
Used for my fuel system upgrade. Worked well, fit well. Everything good.	1
Great product and fast shipping.	1
junk	-1
Filter is only 6 months old/2000 miles...dirty and almost clogged..sure i do alot of city driving and looking at my intake after this filter...it's dirty. Idle was jumpy...cleaned with throttle body cleaner and a new wix paper filter...so much for KN...not impressed.	-1
worked  great and was a perfect fit	1
Nice deal as advertised. K&n kicks butt. Best reusable filter. Always use them in my vehicle. Nice clean flow. Brappp	1
Direct fit in my 03 grand cherokee.  Not sure if it is better or worse but atleast I don't have to replace it ever again.  I am batman.	1
When I finally got the right air filter , (I ordered the wrong size!) It works fine no problems excellent power and gas mileage  betterment	1
This is a great filter since you never have to replace it, haven't noticed any pick-up in horsepower, throttle response, gas milage, or sound.. although it will save money in the long run.	1
I have used K&N filters for decades. They save money on replacement filters and improve gas mileage. If you buy a vehicle to keep for a while, K&N filters will save you money in replacement costs and less gas burned. NO BRAINER!	1
The air filter is of very good quality compared to the previous disposable one that I had in my car. I like the fact that it is washable and reusable although the re-oiling also costs money. The company claims that the filter efficiency is good and the air flow is better, which in theory would increase the engine output and gas mileage.	1
Ive placed K&N air filters in every car Ive owned and have only good things to say about their filters. This one is no different. I simply swapped the Fram filter my Civic had with this one & immediately noticed the difference. The car breathed better thus accelerated with more ease.	1
I rated this 1 star because the "ENSURE IT FITS" solution from AMAZON failed! I own a Honda Civic 1999 LX and it said it fits my car. Unfortunately it doesn't I can't rate the item itself except on material because I did not try it!	-1
The cleaning and roiling kit seems to cost almost as much as a normal filter	1
Didn't fit like it's description said it would. Ended up just tossing it out	-1
Fit nice on the electric fuel pump.	1
Just installed it in my 1998 Honda CR-V. Fit perfect. My wife also has a 1998 CR-V and I put one in hers a few years back and it made a big difference in performance and fuel economy. Hope it does the same for mine.	1
Great Product, perfect fit on my 2000 Honda Civic Ex Sedan. The difference comparing it with the stock one is not much, However, the car definitely runs smoother and picks up faster.	1
K&N filters, what can I say?  They are excellent and I use them in all my vehicles.	1
Very nice quality filter. I bought it mainly for the longevity of it as opposed to a paper filter. Perfect fit for my 99 honda civic hx.	1
does exactly what its supposed to do and saves me money in replacement filters! VROOOOOOOM VROOOOOM!!! Makes my fingers sticky and red!	1
ooooookkkkkkkk	1
These perform no better than a good paper filter and they can even damage some of your sensors in your engine by putting oil into your air stream. They are also thicker than paper filters (think a t-shirt versus a paper towel). I think these are way over-priced and then you still have to buy the expensive special cleaner and oil for them.  You are better of just getting one of these for a lot less money&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pentius-PAB7764-UltraFLOW-Air-Filter/dp/B000EQB6NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pentius PAB7764 UltraFLOW Air Filter</a>.

Cheap and does its job. Used to connect my Holley Fuel Pressure regulator.	1
Great Product....as it was described.........Thanks	1
Performed as expected. Needed teflon tape on threads.	1
Works as advertised	1
Good product	1
Used this with my fuel pressure regulator and filter, all bought from Amazon along with 3/8" fuel line hose. Everything worked great!	1
good product	1
ok	1
Nice finish and quality work!	1
all very well as expected reponsable store.	1
Product is as described:  well made with good appearance.	1
Arrived in good condition will be installing later....Thanks	1
great fitting	1
What can you say about it. it works	1
Updating the old fuel lines and bit of chine can't hurt. It's a simple fitting so not much to say about it. Looks good and feels durable.	1
all very well as expected reponsable store.	1
Nice gauge and I feel it is built well. Decent install instructions and all the parts you'll need, except wire, (and possibly your preferred mounting pod method obviously) are included. It seems to work well in my E4OD. Only complaint is that even new tight now, as soon as my truck heat warms up here in the winter, the lens fogs up for about an hour. I can still see what it's saying no problem, but there's some moisture trying to get out somewhere. Maybe after a hot summer this problem will evaporate (ha)	1
Like the Auto Meter EGT Pyrometer gauge I bought with it, it is the best cheap insurance you can buy to protect your diesel engine and transmission from an extinction event. Hearing the horror stories about $4,000 transmission rebuilds due to overheating I decided to install a temp gauge to find out how hot it was getting. Auto Meter makes a broad line of gauges from budget to plain fancy and all have the same quality you'd expect from them. The probe came with the gauge so there was nothing extra to buy. I would recommend this product to anyone weather you have an automatic or standard transmission.	1
easy to read and came with everything I needed, was a great addition to my car, the entire Z series is nice	1
installed one of these trans temp gauges in my 02 F150 in an overhead gauge pod for a 99 super-duty. the gauge works like it should. easy installation and came with everything i needed to get the job done. gauge comes with two lightbulb sleeves one red and one green. i would suggest changing the bulbs to LEDs instead.  check out my build  [...]	1
This was a good buy for me. The gauge came with everything needed to connect it and get it going. Although they don't give you much mounting options as other manufacturers do. But it was a simple fabrication to my Wrangler's center console.	1
Does what it should and easy to read.	1
Wood quality as always.  Works great	1
Super nice gauges, I have a few and won't get the cheap-os again.  This one probably saved my trans. I was concerned I was getting it hot and sure enough I was. Now I can keep an eye on it and adjust accordingly.	1
Works as it should. Good purchase.	1
Easy install works perfectly for my F250. Used the test port on the trans with no issues. Install took about 45min	1
I purchased this gauge to monitor the transmission temperature while hauling up steep mountain passes.  I also had to buy the Autometer Short Style Sending Unit (part # 2259) and Autometer Metric Adapter M10-1.0 to 1/8" NPT (part # 2265) for it to work on my '07 Nissan Frontier. Other makes/models should research if the supplied sending unit will fit in the transmission test port prior to purchase.  When installing the sending unit make sure to use teflon tape and do not overtorque!  The supplied incandescent bulb is pretty dim and only has red or green bulb caps that come with it. I purchased a mini wedge LED bulb (t3 bulb type: 3-1/4) over at the superbrightleds site. Pretty cheap, will last longer, won't heat up, and much easier to read. I purchased red, cool white, and amber to test them out. Cool white was the easiest to see at night.  Frontier owners - A few tips...Do not use the supplied crush washer - instead remove the rubber o-ring from the original factory transmission test port bolt and then use that on the new sender. I was able to tap into the brake harness under the dash for the ground and 12V illumination. I tapped the upper 12V power port/cigarette lighter for switched power.  4 stars for not supplying an LED and having to purchase so many items just to make the gauge work on my Nissan. Other than that, it's an Autometer. Great gauge and a great buy. Can't beat the quality and price.	1
It didn't really help me.  I still had to use other cleaners and it was a lot of work scraping all my windows.	-1
Installed in a 1998 Jeep Cherokee XJ.  I put the sender in the trans>radiator line to monitor the temperature of the fluid once it leaves the transmission.  So far it works as expected and I'm glad I bought it.	1
Simple yet accurate.	1
I recently lost a transmission from an overheat pulling 20k through the hills of Tennessee. Son one VERY EXPENSIVE rebuild later I bought this. Wish I would have installed this years ago. Gauge reads accurate. I opted for an led instead of an incandescent. I don't feel comfortable with how hot the regular bulbs get.	1
I bought this gauge for my 93 GMC K1500 to monitor the transmission temperature when pulling a trailer. And for this winter, I put a plow on the truck, and I would also like to monitor the temperature then as well, because over winter I use a winterfront so I don't lose engine heat when the truck's block heater is plugged in. Now if it starts to get hot, I can always open up the winterfront to let in more airflow.  So far I have found the gauge to work flawlessly. I have it installed in the test port of my 4L60E, where the mechanic that does transmission work for me suggested I put it (I'm a mechanic, but I don't work much with transmissions). I also have a Hayden 678 tranny cooler installed in front of the AC condenser. When driving down the highway at 60mph, I see temps of about 125-130. Mixed stop and go city and some short 50mph stretches have stayed under 150. When pulling a 20 foot loaded car hauler at about 8500 lbs gross weight with mixed city and highway, the highest spike on a 1 mile long moderate hill at 60mph, I have touched 210 if I really push it. Backing off and taking it easy up the hill shows 190-200.  The gauge comes with: -Gauge -mount -sender with adapters -bulb and socket with red and green covers (which I found dulled the light)  So people are aware, there is no wiring or connectors included. You will need some spade connectors, as well as some length of 18gauge wire. I also suggest installing an in-line fuse with a rating of 5amps.  As of now, I have had the gauge in the truck for a little over 1 month and have no complaints. You may want to consider buying a different mount though. The one included gives you one option, which for my truck worked well. It is installed in the pocket where the stock radio used to be. I have uploaded a picture of where it is.	1
Easy to wire up, comes with quite a few adapters, screwed directly into the test port on my 700R4.	1
Junk, Did not work, lesson learned	-1
not a better gauge in this price bracket, would recommend for anyone on a budget.	1
This part arrived on time with good packaging. It comes with a sending unit and has everything required to install except thread sealer and 16ga wires & connectors.	1
All gauges work well and I like the color changes in them instead of just the numbers.  They are small to take up less room but are a little harder to read but the colors make up the difference.	1
This was my third set of these things.  I always keep one set on the shelf for debugging new engines and periodically I will install them for a secondary reading or just to have a gauge display in a convenient spot for me.  They are inexpensive, convenient and effective.	1
third set i have bought for various cars.  i like the look, fit, and function of these gauges.  have never let me down and work for many, many years.	1
Easy to follow instructions make wiring these gauges a snap. It can be time consuming, but not all that difficult. I daisy-chained all three gauges and their lights together to simplify wiring. Start at one gauge with your positive wire, run that to the positive of the next gauge, and finally the third gauge. Once you have all 3 gauges' positive terminals wired together, you can run just 1 wire to a keyed power source. I did the same thing with the grounds, all three gauges' ground terminals are wired together, along with all 3 of the ground leads for the lights - all connect to 1 wire to a good chassis ground.  After doing that, there are 2 sensor wires to run under the hood and one wire for the lights. One to the temp sensor and one to the oil pressure sensor. The wire for the lights can be added to the panel lights fuse or any wire that gets power when the park/headlights are on.  The panel the gauges come in is a quality piece, however I did not have space to use it. I made a custom panel to fit in the space I had and cut the holes for the gauges. The small 1-1/2" size was perfect for my application.  Gauge set comes with all the sensors needed and basic supplies to mount and connect wiring. Does not come with any wires.  I have used Autometer/Autogage instruments for over 20 years now and have always found them to be quality products.	1
I needed a small gauge that would fit right into the idioit holes in my dashboard where they forgot the gauges.  After much looking these did the job, look good, and I epoxyed them in.  Now I need to connect all the wires up.  They look factory.	1
I used this to remove tint glue reside. It worked reasonably well. I found that it worked best when you scraped while everything was wet. The blade that comes with is a bit useless tho. Its a nice touch anyways tho.	1
Reliable and well lit. Works.	1
Exactly what we needed for significantly less $$ than the auto parts store wanted!	1
Works good.  Looks factory!	1
I was replacing the same gauge from years ago, the sun had faded it and I wanted a fresh looking new one.	1
What can you say, they've been at it a long time.  Quality you can see in so many ways, even down to the gauge movement on startup - just buy it.	1
Super easy to remove Gila film and I mean SUPER EASY! Peel off the film (slowly) spray and lightly scrap the glass clean. Done.  I used to be a automotive tint installer and have never found removing window tint adhesive so easy. However, I have only used this on Gila brand films. Other high end films (3M, Lumar) use better adhesives and I cannot comment at all if this has any affect on them.	1
I tried to use this product on two different cars. One was a 2001 Accord and the other an 07 Camry. The chemical itself didn't help hardly any. I followed the instructions and the film came off in two layers. The layer that was stuck the the window only came off after about grueling 2 hours with the inadequate razor blade holder. The razor kept slipping out adding misery to the job. Just pay the extra few bucks and have the tint shop remove it.	-1
Really disolved the window tint glue very easily and made for easy tint removal.	1
This product was totally ineffective. I followed the directions and found that the adhesive was no easier to remove than if you used soapy water. If you are expecting something with a solvent to really react with the adhesive, this is not what you want.	-1
Wish it had more.	1
It does not work I scribed and none of the tacky glue residue came off I was expecting a chemical reactions to soften and allow the residue liquefy to allow ease of remove value within soap and water after the application.....waited my money and time....	-1
This product will remove your tint like a champ.	1
Worked good and cheap	1
I followed the instructions and was able to remove the film. I sprayed, then covered the window with plastic and taped it shut. 30 minutes later, removed the plastic, sprayed again and put the plastic back with fresh tape. Next morning I started peeling from an upper corner, and slowly and carefully I removed the film in one piece. Then a Scotch brite blue sponge with Fantastic cleaner. Rinced the sponge often. Finally, a microfiber cloth and acetone (nail polish remover will do).  Letting the product do it's work is key. The film had been on the window since 2002.	1
I removed my tint and a lot of glue stayed on the windows and whatever I tried did not remove it until I bought this little kit. Took me about an hour to clean my 4 windows but well worth it.	1
ITS the Little Details that make the biggest difference! Spectre and Amazon came thru inna big way with this lil dress up wire separators.. Excellent quality, and ease of install.. Bright and brilliant chrome sets my engine compartment apart from 99% of society.. 10/10 recommendations and satisfaction..	1
if you are looking for an affordable way to dress up your engine this isn't it, spend the little extra and get good metal ones. these look great in the add but are poor quality.	-1
excellent product thank you very much	1
I wasn't very pleased with this product overall. I was expecting some nice alluminum/metal wire separators and instead these are cheap plastic separators. Putting them on isn't the easiest because the bolt tries to fall out whenever you go to put them on. I didn't even bother to leave them on for this reason. I found a parts car and took some of the factory wire separators off of it for my 82' Supra.	-1
nice little gauge cluster - put it on my 83 cj7, nice to have gauges that work.  note - i hadn't ever done gauges before, and didn't realize the oil pressure sender is calibrated to the gauge - so initially I thought I had a major problem when the oil pressure was pegged out.  Then I put in the oil sender included in this kit, and all is good (my bad, good kit...)	1
Look ok. Be advised, they are plastic.	1
Arrived on time and in excellent condition, look good, and work great!	1
Very cheap plastic	-1
Great product	1
Cheap Plastic.. Trust me don't order..Its a Joke	-1
Looks good,working like supposed to be!	1
I bought this for my 1994 Celica GT, and it works great! The throttle is much more responsive giving a little kick to it. The difference in mpg is little to none though. Great for unleashing more HP and Torque though!	1
Just what i was expecting. Great durable filter that will last forever. Fit perfectly, sounds great :D Car instantly felt a tad bit more responsive. I love K&N!!!	1
It's a snug fit for my application, but K&N makes the best filters in the world, you can't beat that.	1
This stuff actually works pretty good at covering up nicks and scratches on your vehicle. There's a colored lipstick-like tube that you can use to blob some wax onto the defect and then you apply the liguid wax itself over the bad area. Then buff like you would normal wax.  I use this after I've already waxed my car with my regular wax (Meguiars) to just hide the chipped areas that are visible. Regular waxes are normally white and they tend to collect in the nicks and make them even more visible. This colored Turtle Wax is much better at hiding the bad areas. Although the Turtle Wax itself isn't in the same league as some of the better carnauba waxes, it's good enough for the touchup areas.  Using Turtle Wax Color Cure is definitely much easier than fooling aroung trying to use touchup paint which never matches and is always a hassle.	1
First things first, if you DIY then be sure to watch some videos on the net to see the tips and tricks from the Pro's. I can't stress it enough, I fumbled through the first roll before calling my dad and haveing to go to the local car shop to get another roll. I do have to say, price was compareable to Amazon. As for installation, thats not to be complained about here... Every roll of DIY tinting is exactly the same size, and same applications. As for the product itself... This tint is the 3rd out of the normal 3 sold. There are lighter and less dark, but for the three main sold, this is the middle. Its more of a smoke than a dark smoke. Its def is not the darkest out there. For most states that make it illigal to install in the front side windows, the cops may have to think a bit about it, or go get their do-dad that measures it. As for now, this is right in between no tint and my factory tinting in the back, perfectly what I wanted. Its hard to explain, and I hope it helps. So, be sure to watch the vids. Get a squegee, or a credit card. And a bottle with a ton of water and a bit of dawn, The tools suck, but water and dawn make up for it. Seriously, you cant hurt the film, unless you don't spray BOTH sides with water Dawn mix!. Dureing the process, don't be shy, the more you use, the better it will look. This kit will do 2 side windows, thats it... maybe a small back window, but if you have a car, then get the back window kit, it comes in strips of longer material thats designed to be in the back, and in layers, not one big piece... but if you have a pickup or similar with a small window(s), this one may do the trick.  Good luck!  One year later (Dec of 12) There are no bubbles, no tearing from the window going up and down. I found a hair in there the other day, but thats my fault. Who have written it doesn't last must not have installed it right.	1
I buy this tint from my local autozone ive been doing my truck and my friends trucks for about 2 years and i love this tint its not easy to tear and doesnt fade	1
This stuff does work very well to keep heat and light down in your car (or other window).  However you should be aware that it is very difficult to install on any window that is curved.  It is almost impossible to get all the bubbles out of it and it will crease - guaranteed.  Maybe i just don't know the tricks that pros use to install this, but i got it working pretty well on my rear windows (Nissan Sentra) but the rear windsheld was much more curved and unless i am missing something, there is no good way to make a flat surface curved without either cutting it or creasing it.  It still works fine - so if you want to do it yourself and don't care too much about how it looks then go right ahead.  FYI - Small windows are a bit of a pain too as it moves when you try to trim the edges if the piece is too small.  - Recommended for medium sized flat windows. - Not Recommended for curved windows, small windows, or large windows (difficult to piece two sheets together).  ********** UPDATE 11/11/11 *********************  Giving one star back as it came to my attention that you can heat shrink curved surfaces.  I don't remember anything in the instructions mentioning this (which would have been helpful), but that would have helped a lot.  On another note The tint is still holding strong to my car windows  (over 3 years later).  My installation job doesn't look great, but is still helping keep the car cooler.	1
Actually work well and look good at the same time.  Buy two sets though	1
A+	1
Good Stuff	1
Look great it's plastic I think u want plastic but it kinda cheap plastic waiting to see if the metal bolt that holds it together will rust the Alan wreach it came with did	1
Arrived quickly looks great.	1
Excelent Product	1
execlete producto	1
Use on my 300 SRT- Construction good. Have no idea if this is better then others. Who would know? But the red looks great. I tried to wash and oil- did not look great and just easier to buy new one.  Amazon price is $6.00 higher then O'Reilly Auto But as all Amazon products we pay more but save time and gas. Saved an hour by buying from Amazon	1
very cool part. I used this on my 2001 4.0 EXPLORER as well as Spectre Performance 8145 Mass air flow sensor adaptor. I got some more power and mpgs and didn't spend a whole lot doing so.	1
Great.	1
These filters look nice, but the construction just isn't what I was expecting. The filter media is much thinner than most of the other inverted cone filters that I've used, and while this technically does not negatively affect the filtration, I do not trust it to hold up in the engine bay. The finish on the outside was good, but inside several wire mesh strands were dangling from where the epoxy and end caps meet. The only reason I won't be returning these is because they work well on my air compressor.  I will not be using them on my vehicles.	-1
give my maxima more horse power	1
I replaced a K&N air filter with this Spectre Air Filter that was on a custom built air intake on my 2003 Wrangler Rubicon. I had used the old filter on a couple of vehicles and it was time for a new one. The air intake and most of my engine is black so I choose this filter. The filter looks and performs great. Is has a much deeper tone than the old filter that sounds slot better.	1
Fits perfect and it does the job that it supposed to do	1
Looks good in my fairlane 500	1
These look good but the construction is cheap. I expect flaking will start soon even though the vehicle is garaged.	-1
they work good and look good	1
work great, look good, fast shipping	1
As advertised.	1
Ecellent	1
It's a good product, I have done it really easy on my rear windows... putting it on windows that roll up and down takes a lot! Of patience and control of the tint. If you dedicate a good block of time, you can get great results!	1
Works as expected and im a beginner just takes patients	1
My husband loves this polish for my car and my Toyota truck cover small scratches well.	1
WORKING AS ADVERTISED	1
verry good	1
very happy with product	1
Great product from Spectre, I would recommend them to anyone . Packaged well and shipped fast.	1
Very nice	1
works well	1
nice look for the under manifold wires	1
You will probably want to rip it off and throw it in the trash while you are applying it because the wrinkles are so frustrating but once you let it dry in the sun for a few days it actually looks rediculously good for the price. Do not buy if you think this will be an easy job or you hate DIY. Definitely takes a willing mind and a can do attitude. The satisfaction at the end is quite pleasing however and I'm definitely proud of my work!	1
The shipping box was fine, but the tint box was crunched and there is crease damage on the tint.	-1
This is good tint for the price. If you're new to tinting watch a tone of YouTube videos before trying it for the first time and buy 1 more roll than you think you need because your gonna screw up at least once. (Tip Stat with your flattest and/or smallest window first and use plenty of soapy water.) It doesn't shrink as much as the professional stuff when heated.	1
easily installed and works great	1
great value	1
Love It... Great Value...	1
bought for my 79 ford bronco. looks great wired in in less that 20 minutes. setting the light was easy. great buy	1
I like them but the only downside its they look a little little low quality but obviously they work. If you want your engine to look better on a budget this is your item.	1
hreat polish on them looks great on wires and works well on 66 mustang 289	1
These are junk will not be using these.... guys they look nice in pictures when ordered them but they are cheaply constructed and do not recommend... waistng your money you will be disappointed...... Plastic not chrome like description said....STAY AWAY....	-1
Looks great! Not too dark and has great visibility!	1
Blue tint not smoke	-1
Works  great	1
I had to bend it in order to make it work for my application, but its a good product. Very thick and will not deform.	1
good!	1
Excellent product and price.	1
Perfect	1
looks great.  very strong part	1
very good	1
I tried this on our vehicles and it actually worked on small chipped areas pretty well. You use the lipstick style tube to daub colored thick wax into the damaged area, let it harden some more for a while, then use the liquid wax over it. From a few feet away, the chipped areas aren't noticeable.  Regular waxes are usually light colored and wind up leaving white wax in the chipped areas making them stand out even more. Using this colored wax eliminates that problem.  The liquid wax itself really isn't the best I've ever used (I like Mequiar's better), so before using this Turtle Wax to hide the nicked areas, I use my normal wax over the entire vehicle.  For small nicks, this stuff works.	1
good!	1
looks great.  very good part for the money	1
Serves its purpose.	1
Perfect for smoothing in uneven wax and enhancing color on the car.	1
After having used the car polish on a red 2010 Toyota Corolla, the results where less than spectacular.  I was looking for something to take care of minor scratches around the door handles and some deeper ones that exposed the base coat.  It did neither.  The wax did not erase or hide any of the scratches to the paint.  It did shine the finish, but any car wax product could have done the same.  I even re-applied for a second and third coat in some area's to see if that would improve the performance of the wax, but no go.  Mostly what this did was turn my buffing cloth red.  I applied and buffed out by hand, so your mileage may vary with a electric buffer.  If you give this product a try ensure you have plastic/rubber gloves for you hands as it will stain, though it washed off with mild soap.	-1
First - I've read every review of this product here - and if you do like me, and look at reviews before you buy - ignore all the negative ones that talk about bubbles, cloudiness, not enough film and/or spoilage - those are "installer" errors, and not the fault of the manufacturer, or defective product.  I bought my film from Autozone, the box, and Gila's website tell you how much film is contained, and gives you an idea of how much car it will cover - one rear window, or two side windows, I was tinting a compact SUV, which has more glass than a sedan, so I bought three rolls, one for the rear screen, one for the two rear side windows, and one for the two rear doors.  This is not my first time applying tint, but, it has been many, many years, since I've done it.  Applying tint film is not difficult, but it's also no walk in the park - there are tricks & techniques that the professionals have developed and unless/until you master those, don't blame your mistakes on the manufacturer or the product - don't try to it by yourself, you need two pairs of hands, don't try to do it outdoors unless it's a very calm day, the slightest hint of wind will get hold of the film and create all sorts of problems for you.  I did the two small rear windows (the cargo area sides) first, and those went very well, so, encouraged, I decided to try my hand with the rear screen and made a total mess of it, so I stripped the film off and tossed it - the basic problem is that the rear screen is a "compound curve" - not only does it curve from left to right, it curves from top to bottom.  Next day, I took the film and the car to a professional and asked him if he would tint the rear screen using my film - which he agreed to do - he applied the film whilst I watched and in less than half the time it took me to screw it up, he had the film flawlessly applied - I was so impressed that I had him finish the entire job (basically the two rear doors), rather than struggle with it personally.  What did he do that I didn't?  He used a heat gun on low to gently shrink & shape the film against the outside of the rear screen - before applying the film to the inside.  The end result was a professional, quality job, virtually indistinguishable from factory tint and one of things he shared with me was that the Gila film was a thicker, better quality film that the product he normally uses.	1
good product.	1
Having the option to spend thirty bucks and an hour or so of my time or two hundred bucks for professional tint on a car over twenty years old is an easy decision.  You will get what you pay for, which is cheap tint.  This stuff is not as thick and will not lay down as smooth as the 3M or other higher grade tint that the professionals use.  If you have a nice car, pay to have it tinted professionally.  If it is an older car that isn't worth the investment and you can live with something that is most likely not going to be perfect, tint it yourself, there are plenty of articles and videos online that will walk you through it.  The side windows were done in 20%.  Also used the 5% 6" strips for the rear window and had enough to put a strip across the windshield.  Worked fine if you can live with 1/8" lines on the rear window where the tint overlaps.	1
Bought the basic version of 35% didn't care for it too much. Bought , this one in 35% and like it. Not only is it thicker and easier to lay down, the clarity along with durability is great. Use plenty of water/solution. Tinted my sunroof on my honda civic, works perfect. Enough to see the blue sky but not even to fade interior and heat up my car. Would buy again. Bough better tint for the rest of the car from Ebay and was precut. Lexen tint is good and llumar is better. Lexen did the rest of the car my advice, heat shrink it first. I used a blow dryer to take the curling out from it being on a roll. Use your head and do it once before you rip it off and blame the company	1
BUENO	1
installed these wire seprators on my msd spark plug wires makes the routing of wires look great	1
Ver y good	1
Will see how it goes when I do the upgrades.	1
This filter cannot be beat for the price.  Construction feels very solid and seems to work just as well as other major brands.	1
Great product	1
Great air filter. Nothing wrong with really, and it would fit on a 1999-2003 Chevy Malibu 3.1L V6. It fit on my 03 Chevy Malibu	1
Makes the truck go superfast (just kidding). it fit properly and it does give it a smoother acceleration.	1
We returned it.  It was hard to apply and could not get the bubbles out.  If you want quality you should go to a professional for tint.  Way too difficult and my husband is a body man and a mechanic.	-1
The Amazon listing is for GILA Ultra Shield, with "Lifetime Warranty". As another reviewer posted, I too received GILA Heat Shield Plus, with "2 Year Warranty". I returned my order to Amazon for a refund, and will look elsewhere.	-1
Thick perfect tint. Been 3 years no bubbles nor peeling. Professional install	1
Looks alright, but its a pain to install.  Doesn't shrink right and the adhesive is not great.	-1
disappointing. I have bought these a few times just at the local stores and have never had a problem. The one I ordered off of Amazon however, was poor in quality. I did one window, then when I went to unroll the film for the second window, the film had a ton of creases in the middle of the roll... making it unusable. I tried to apply and use a heat gun just to see if I could get it to work, but no luck. waste of $.	-1
I was very disappointed with the quality of this PLASTIC product. Not very solid and will not last long.	-1
Excellent	1
EXCELENT	1
I love them	1
I like that this is chrome and has the allen screw... Just wish it was metal not chrome covered plastic...  :0	1
These wire sepatators work great, I am able to keep my plug wire in  order without the wires coming loose . Saves  alot of time when changing plugs , or  adjusting valves, not having to figure out which wire goes to which plug. Nice part at a great price. They are plastic, not metal, but do the job as intended	1
The separators are pretty, they will dress up your pig with lipstick for sure. they are chrome plated plastic with Allen screws to tighten them around the secondary ignition wires. They work well and do the job they were designed for. Good price, good service.	1
good item, cheap and easy to use.... as long as the wind aint  blowin like crazy	1
excellent	1
Purchased this product to do my rear window in the truck. Wasted two entire rolls. This product is very hard to use. Placing on window without it becoming a complete disaster or looking terrible is very difficult. I would rather windows that are not tinted over windows that are but look terrible	-1
Nicely made filter	1
great fit on my '11 genesis coupe using a 3" coupler.	1
used it with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Spectre-Performance-9751-Black-4-34-Air-Duct-Hose/dp/B001OMM7HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Spectre Performance 9751 Black 4" Air Duct Hose</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Spectre-Performance-9741-Black-4-34-x-3-5-34-Intake-Coupler/dp/B001OMK5NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Spectre Performance 9741 Black 4" x 3.5" Intake Coupler</a>&nbsp;on 5.7 Hemi ,works good far now	1
Great filter and worth the price. The color almost matched my engine bay perfectly!	1
It does the job up to a point. I have had this item in use for just over a year now. If you have a turbo, take warning!!! The fancy chrome center piece in the middle of the cone can come loose and very well cause severe damage to your turbo by being sucked in. At 1st I thought my turbo was bad, and this is what I found. I got lucky, no turbo damage. The manufacturer needs to look at a better adhesive that holds on the chrome pieces.	-1
Have this on my 2001 Chevy Malibu 3.1L it gave it a great sound. I only have the filter not full cold air intake.	1
Filter fit my car perfectly and made an immediate difference in my engine performance being over 6000 feet and living in a dusty area I could have bought 3 of these with the money I sent last year on OEM filters every 3 months. I am very pleased with this product it has already paid for its self by not having to replace it and the filter  was easy to clean with the kit and reinstall myself.	1
I purchased this K&N high flow air filter in preparation for converting my 2003 Dodge Neon SE to e85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline).  I installed the K&N filter about two weeks prior to the e85 conversion and can honestly say that the acceleration of the vehicle was a little more responsive than what I was accustomed to.  In addition, the mpg appeared to go up slightly (maybe 1 to 2 mpg).  Note: I did not alter anything else on my car (tire pressure, spark plugs, oil, etc.) and did not change my driving habits.  I have read a lot of online forum posts from people insisting that increased air flow to the engine does not make a difference as fuel injection systems will adjust the fuel/air mixture accordingly.  While I do partially agree with them, I believe there has to be some benefit of letting the air intake system breathe a little easier.  In addition, you've got nothing to lose as the filter comes with a 1,000,000 mile warranty and can be cleaned & reused.	1
I purchased this spring set to replace the old one on my '85 pick-up. They were easy to install. They are a bit stiff compared to my old one, but I'm sure they will break-in just fine. Would recommend product!	1
Great looking Return springs liked the dual layer of pull for my Carbed C3 . Easy to install looks good too!!	1
Great stuff. Easy installation with dish soap and water.	1
Great filter with the different size inserts to fit different intakes. Keep it clean and oiled and it will last a long time!	1
Easy to install	1
Cheap and decent air filter.  Worked fine on my beater with a speed density adapter	1
Probably fine as a wax/polish but does not hide even the faintest of scratches. I tried on two of my black cars and it did little with respect to scratches/blemishes/dents. Like others say, just don't expect any miracles.  UPDATE 4/22: Upgraded by rating from 2 stars to 3.  I waxed the entire car today and noticed the following: 1. did not mask/hide/cover scratches. Even the faintest ones as mentioned in my initial review 2. did achieve a nice shine which I'm quite pleased 3. did seem to mask/over swirls. This alone may be worth using.	-1
Great product	1
Worked great on my black pickup. Does not leave white in seams and on edges. Easy to apply and remove. Worked equally well on my dark gray car.	1
The before and after photos on the bottle are 100% misleading.  No magic here, it does help mask the scratches a little, but if you can still see them and it does nothing to hide chips, as suggested by the fake pictures on the bottle.	-1
great just what it said it would be	1
I bought this turtle wax polish hoping to fill in the paint cracks that were in my 93 Firebird. This stuff did the trick. It even fixed the crappy GM paint that was starting to crack on the rear bumper. The did not make my car showroom quality by any means, but it really does looks 80% better. I am very impressed with this product.  However, do not be sold by the chapstick tube that comes with the bottle. This did not work at all. It did not fill in any large nicks or holes. The only way to fix things like that would be to repaint the car. Also, when you put the wax on the car it is very hard to tell what you waxed because the red blends in so well with the paint.  Overall this product is a very good buy for the price and for an aging paint job. I have yet to see how long the polish will last on the car but I am hopeful!	1
just go to a tinting store and have it done, this is cheap material	-1
I messed up when installing and got a few bad spots. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because it is a little light even for 35%. Has been installed for a while now and the part i did not mess up seems to be holding up nicely.	1
Great product fast shipping would buy again	1
saved for bug out kit	1
Fast service...Great quality,looks and value. Installed in a few minutes and can already tell increase in HP.....	1
Love these filters comes with adapters to fit various diameter intakes, good filter for the money.	1
OK!!!	1
works great ,nice quality	1
good!	1
MUY BUENO	1
I will be using on my 1965 Pontaic GTO . Make sure throttle arm returns to idle position with a nice pedal feel .	1
did the job for me	1
Works just like it should	1
Outstanding, as long as you understand and accept the limitations of cheap tint films. If you are not understanding and accepting of these limitations, then go take it somewhere and pay somebody a few hundred dollars to do a professional job with professional film. Obviously, this can't compete with professional films. But at the same time, it is a lot cheaper and easier to apply than professional tint films. As long as you take your time and do proper prep on the windows, this actually turns out fairly well. If this is your first, second, or even fifth time tinting a window, just order more than you need. You WILL screw it up. Don't get caught short. And don't leave a negative review just because you don't know what you're doing.	1
Installed it on my truck. Came out great, but I do have a lot of prior experience with Gila products having installed their low E film in my house. If this is your first time at applying window films, be prepared to waste some, there is a learning curve. The more application solution you use the better, I'd say you almost cannot use too much. Using too little is recipe for failure, bubbles, wrinkles and poor positioning.	1
Great product for the summer heat and sun. It is not going to reflect much as it is just black but, you can first put on GILA 35% dark smoke which has a very high UV protection to block the sun/heat/rays.	1

good	1
Good product. I use it on the rock chips on my black car. Front bumper. Takes 2 applications. Really works. It will stain . Wear gloves. Always aply it with an orbital.	1
This stuff is great. Really helps hide small stone chips in black paint. Great for front end of car. It's not permanent, but the wax pencil really hides small road rash. Wax with normal wax and all the road rash stands out. Not with this black wax.	1
Very Good Product	1
Easy install and improved the fuel economy	1
looks good haven't installed yet waiting for the custom intake pipe to be finished....	1
As Advertised	1
This cleaner provides considerably more air flow than my current 7 year old cold air filter. Noticeable immediately, highway and local driving, Amazed at the difference.	1
I didn't care for this product at all.  The problem is that you get the impression that it covers scratches and gives a brilliant polish.  Instead, I tried this out on my suburban with some scratches (both tiny and larger).  It did cover the small (I mean SMALL scratches) but anything else it wouldn't do too well on.  The other thing is, if you wash the car or drive the vehicle in the rain the wax seems to wear off rapidly...like really fast.  The only reason I gave it two stars is that it does cover SMALL surface scratches but that's about it and only for a few days.	-1
Made a noticeable difference on my truck finish.	1
Goes of after a first wash!!! Dont spend money on this polish please	-1
Used on black jeep. Does hide minor scratches. Would buy again.	1
window tint is best left to the pro's i am not a pro!!!	-1
This is by far the best tint that I have ever installed.  I'm not a "professional" installer, but I'm both a perfectionist and someone that spends a lot of time upgrading the looks and performance of vehicles.  I can't imply enough how essential it is that you cut your window patterns to the exact size before installing this stuff.  Yes, the adhesion is great but this stuff is so tough that a surgical scalpel has a very difficult time making clean cuts through the film.	1
if u never tinted windows don't even purchase this waste of time and money and stress. the video makes it look so easy but its not. just pay local tint 180 for 5 windows or 140 for 3 windows	-1
Very happy, I now realize I would rather to have had a darker shade, but this still makes it hard to see into the vehicle unless direct light is used.	1
Love this.	1
probably works good on very tiny scratches, but not big ones	1
nice product	1
This product does exactly what it says, it covers up  swirl marks and scratches . And it does it very well. Its NOT a remover. People need to read what a product does before assuming then buying.	1
Great filters.	1
Works great! Will keep buying these filters, I love the open air access, low price, and ease of use.	1
Great filter, with a mean sound. Only problem with it, is that it is not pre-oiled as it says it is. However, that's only important if you do lots if off road, or dusty driving. I recommend to clean every 5000 miles, if non oiled.	1
Good	1
Does the job	1
good quality filter, and installed easily. helped pull my custom cold air intake together nicely.	1
Works as described. Be sure to let it dry thoroughly before wiping.	1
I was hoping this would help me remove swirl marks from car washes but it did nothing....I take care of my car and thought this product look promising as turtle wax is my go to brand for all my car needs and this specific product was just useless. Just a black colored liquid that didn't really do anything that it said. I had to use the turtle wax black wax spray to help remove this and bring the shine out with the swirl marks still there.	-1
Nice	1
good	1
Bought this with Spectre 9599 3.5" Aluminum Mandrel Elbow and replaced stock filter & cover on my 05 Dakota. It works well and looks pretty good.	1
Installed on my 07 Expedition with a little fabrication, noticed an increase in power.	1
so far so good !	1
works good	1
Gained almost 1 sec. for my 0-60 (mph) time (8.9s) :-) Connected to resonator box via a 3.5 to 4 inch red coupler, a 4 x 4 inch aluminium straight pipe, a 4 to 4 coupler, and a 4inch diameter 90 degree alum. pipe. Sits in old air intake box, so I can replace it with my box filter if going off-road in 5 minutes - WJ Grand Cherokee 4.7L	1
I didn't buy this off Amazon, instead I bought it at O'reilly, only because I didn't feel like waiting for it to be delivered.  Anyway, anyone on here that says it is easy to install if full of it. It comes with 2 adapters. One for 3 inch intakes, and one for 3.5 inch intake, and if you use no adapter then it fits on 4.5 inch intakes. Well, my intake is 3.25 inch so I tried using the 3.5 inch adapter. Tightening the hose clamp all the way and there was still about a half inch gap between the filter and the intake tubing so instead I ended up not going with either adapter. I put a spare coupler onto the end of the tubing, put the filter on and tightening the hose clamp all the way. So far it works but wish they had made the adapter better.	-1
Good product	1
This is a pretty low quality film.  I bought two rolls of 5%.  I had a roll come out of the box with a really bad crease in it.  It was at the end of the roll but left about 2 linear feet unusable.  If you buy this I recommend unrolling the entire roll and inspecting it.  Amazon refunded me but it was a hassle because I couldn't finish tinting the car until I could find it locally.  In retrospect I should have just purchased a pre-cut kit of pro-level film.  This stuff does not handle heat well when trying to shrink it.  It's very tough to get the temperature just right that it shrinks but doesn't permanently crease.  I've done quite a bit of tinting over the years and the pro stuff is worth the money.  Hoping this doesn't fade too bad or turn purple in a month.	-1
Cheap tint! Works fine, be super careful with the roll or you'll wrinkle it. This is the perfect compromise between privacy, Sun protection, and outward visibility.	1
There are a lot of products out there for leather. This helps to clean and condition the leather in your car and with regular use will keep the seats from showing age and cracking. Best thing to do is to turn on the heat and warm the seats up. Then apply the product. Let it sink in and then gently wipe off excess with a good micro fiber cloth.  Keeps the new cars looking new on the inside and helps the older cars maintain a nice appearance.	1
works well, smells good , leave leather sofa and automotive seats clean and conditioned without feeling greasy , i used to find this in the stores locally but now have to buy online for some reason .	1
For the price, these are great. The bolts were almost too short, though. I could have probably used a different mount location if needed. In hindsight, the pin keeper cables should have been part of my order. I didn't use the screws to mount the circular plate to the hood. I used pop rivets instead because I think they are more secure and look better.  I also sprayed primer wherever bare metal was exposed, as this is necessary to help prevent unsightly rust. All in all, these are an inexpensive solution to ensuring a secure hood.	1
Nice product and was as described	1
it works great	1
I purchased this to tint the windows on a 2000 Civic coupe, just 2 fixed rear sides and the rear window. I used to tint windows professionally, but it's been a few years so I bought an extra roll to have some in case (3 total - measure the longest points of your windows).  My mistake that completely slipped my mind was measuring the height of my rear window. It's not Gila's fault that I forgot.  The headline for this product comes from the utter uselessness of this product. It's 24 inches tall, unless you're tinting a pickup truck, it will automatically be too short. If you're experienced in using two sheets and cutting a midline to line them up, too bad, because it's only 10 feet long, it's not long enough to reach across the window again.  Maybe the spare piece will work on the side window. No, it won't. So you need two rolls for the back window and one roll for the side window and then you end up with a lot of left over parts that are good for nothing. Unbelievable how terrible the planning is for this product.  Again, this is on a 2000 Honda Civic Coupe, one of the most popular compact cars on the planet. I won't need to purchase a Gila product again or recommend them.	-1
Very strong and protective paper.	1
I'm not a tint professional however i have tinted several of my own vehicles.  I thought this tint was good but not the best i have ever used.  Just another roll of tint.  Nice color and seems good quality, Not quite as thick as other tint I've used and i think its easier to install if its thicker.	1
It's a filter... it filters the air real good.	1
Excellent ,item is great,fit is nice	1
nice. great look and well made. have two kn and these are working with the same air flow.	1
This is a really great air filter for the price and right out of the box you can feel a bit of increased horsepower and also very easy installation because it's universal.	1
This cover doesn't come close to fitting my bench seat in my 1988 toyota pick up. Which is a very small bench seat. I ended up buying a micro fiber blanket at costco and securing it with grommets and bungee cords.	-1
I love this wax it makes my call Look new	1
It is what it is	1
doesnt really coat over scratches at all	-1
It appears to be good quality but I'm not really a good judge since this was my first time to tint.  It was enough to tint two windows and it matches my other tint.	1
Works great on leather and the interior of my lexus. I highly recommend	1
Good quality.	1
awesome leather maintainer	1
Cleaned and conditions the leather, and cleans the door panels, dash panels.  It is great stuff.	1
Have been using this for years and it has yet to let me down.  Everyone should have one of these if you own a car!	1
Very good budget meter.  Works great, fairly accurate for an analog meter. Reasonable price.	1
Works great to conceal swirl marks made by crappy car wash places. A little work with some clean Micro Fiber cloths will bring your Black Back!	1
Works pretty well and does what it claims to do	1
No works as they said,THE COLOR NOT COMES BACK! Its a normal wax.	-1
Installs well, no problems, would buy again if the need arises. A nice shade of smoke color. Highly recommend, not too dark, but dark enough to keep the sunburn off.	1
All ways fresh which makes it easier to install. Not to dark really help save the heat build up inside my little truck. I took the glass out and installed the tint. Let it set 24 hours and installed the glass. it looks great.	1
I'm just another one of those guys who in this economy likes to DIY before paying someone hundreds of dollars to do it. I have never tinted anything before, I was a little nervous about messing it up but this stuff is cheap enough it won't kill me to buy another roll if I do. I was surprised how easy it was, just follow what the Gila video says and it works fine, don't be scared of the product, apply the solution generously! I ordered their application kit which works great, I can only recommend it, that way you have just what you need for the job and know it's clean. The key for this to work well is to clean the glass properly before, one crumb of dust and you have a bubble. Too little solution and you can't adjust the foil well and it creases. Stay focused, don't rush, and with some patience you'll have great looking tinted windows in under an hour depending on the size.  I will gladly buy this product again if they hold up in the long run, just finished applying the foil 10 min ago so time will tell how good they really are.	1
Good quality film. Easy to install. Gives a little blue tint look when looking inside the vehicle from the out	1
I have used there other products for my house and It made a big difference in the heat that was getting into the house thru the windows	1
I've been running Redline synthetic oil in my 5.0 track toy for years now, and despite seeing coolant temps as high as 240 on one occasion and oil temps regulalry as high as 275, my Blackstone labs oil analyses keep coming back with wear on the low end of the normal range.  You can run Redline with confidence.	1
Quick and easy , just as described ... Would buy again !	1
Seems to be great, good price, I am not an expert on these things but seem to be a great value.	1
I bought this air filter after looking at others costing $50 more almost. I decided to choose this brand and it is great quality and build.	1
i ordered this product because of the price and the brand was great and easy to install to any intake manifold.	1
It's everything an air filter should be fits perfect on my AEM cold air intake and look good thank you	1
This makes my car shiny and beautiful...but does not seem to last 3 months.	1
Thin and watery. The older product was much better. It did not eliminate swirl marks and it appeared to actually dull the paint. I would not recommend buying or using this product.	-1
Turtle Wax Black is the best black wax on the market!!! If you have a black vehicle and you want a shine use Turtle Wax Black you will not believe the showroom shine you will achieve. Better than showroom shine in my opinion....	1
Thank you, just as expected!!	1
excelente muy bueno gracias.	1
I've used this once thus far and it seems to work well.	1
Its not hard pleasing black leather, particularly if your car spends most of the time in the garage, away from the sun. Still, I like how this looks on my leather seats. Its not overly expensive and it does a real good job.	1
I use this for my office treatment tables as they are covered in black leather.  Works great to clean them and keep them soft.  Also works great for getting women's makeup off the tables.	1
I purchased this Item and it was delivered damaged badly. The outside (amazon box) was basically crushed in half. There was no packing materials inside the box at all and the tint itself was basically folded and creased in half. I put in for a return and Amazon (as usual) promptly sent a new one with a well packaged box with stuffing and all. The box that the tint comes in from the manufacturer arrived in MINT condition. I unrolled the tint and cut it for the first window. The first 8 or 10" were damaged somehow. Seems like a manufacturing issue so I discarded it. I did the first window and went to the passenger side. I unrolled the tint for the next window to find the last 3 feet was JUNK. Completely creased and folded. I don't understand how the factory can package this stuff. I ripped the tint off the first window (I don't want to drive with only ONE window tinted) and threw everything in the trash. Never again. I will use 3M from now on. I used it for 30 years with no issues. $15 lesson learned.	-1
used this on my house;  i live in phoenix az;  this helps a lot in reducing solar heat gain coefficient;  good for your car or hour home;  don't believe that nonsense about the film messing with the window seal;  it works fine on double pane windows & will not adversely affect their R value	1
I can't complain about this window tint. It's pretty good. I picked it up at an auto parts store along with a window-tint kit (that included spray, a squeegee, lint free cloth, and a razor blade). Whether this job succeeds or fails is on you. Definitely search windowing tinting extensively online and watch videos. Take your time. Also, I would suggest getting a heat gun. Even a generally "flat" window has some curve to it. The tint needs to shrink to those curves. The 24"x6' roll will do two windows or one rear window. I used it to tint my quarter windows (behind the rear passenger seat but before the rear window) since all of my other windows were already done (professionally). So far so good. I messed up the first two times so I only had enough left to do one of the windows lol. I'm going to buy some more and finish up later.  I have a few GENERAL tips mainly for a stationary window in particular (this is just the basics, not in depth details):  1). Clean the windows very very well and run a wet razor blade on both sides of the window(s) to clean up dirt, paint, etc. 2). Clean the windows AGAIN, and one more time after that. 3). Wet the outside window and lay your tint over it. Make a ROUGH cut (leave a few inches of room to play with). Squeegee the tint down if you have to to get a better cut. 4). Wet the inside of the window and do a rough placement BEFORE you remove the clear film to expose the tint. 5). Make a more refined cut of the area you're tinting. Get as accurate as you can. 6). While removing the clear film spray the tint as you peel and the window itself again. 7). Place the tint on the window and squeegee air bubbles and water from the middle outwards. 8). While squeegee-ing, wet the other side of the tint as well so the squeegee glides easier. 9). As you finish squeegee-ing, wrap a lint-free cloth around it to absorb excess fluid. 10). You're done!	1
The tint is blocks out most of the sun rays as advertised.  I have a very sensitive right eye due to a freak accident as a kid, so I very much am dreadful of the sun and its UV rays.  I used this tint on my enclosed patio sliding door and I just couldn't be happier.  It's well worth it, especially for the price.	1
Works alright.	1
does what it is supposed to do	1
Some cars don't have a tachometer (or maybe it's broken!), so a device like this will come in handy when tuning the idle RPM.  I use it on my '71 Super Beetle when I need to tune it.	1
I bought this with the intention of tuning up my old 60 F100 with it, old school style.  I ended up taking the truck to a real mechanic.  Still I like this little old fashion meter.	1
all good thanks	1
Good	1
The best colored wax I ever use signs beautifully easy-to-use	1
Don't waste the money...or rather realize you getting it out of a bottle.  Product over-promised - under-delivered for sure!	-1
this is the 3rd one i have purchased-it has multi fit adapters for different diameters-mostly can just replace oem  filter by just installing and removing air box cover that is on oem round filters-not 100% sure if will work on all vehicles?	1
The company that did the LS V8 conversion on my Jeep Wrangler installed this filter. The shop is extremely knowledgable and felt this filter was as good as any filter of its type on the market but at a much better price. I have two spares that I keep pre-oiled in ziploc bags in case I get in real dusty conditions.	1
This is a great filter, used it to replace a K&N filter that was put on the truck by a previous owner and had a hole wore through it because of improper mounting. Same great quality as K&N and under half the price!	1
I bought it to use on a kit for my Ranger but now it is being used on our Scion xB	1
Gives a nice custom look to my engine. Works good with little maintenance and has just enough chrome to add a little flair to my engine bay.	1
Good product	1
Great for leather seats & smells decent too. I like that it's not that glossy, just cleans & leaves a subtle shine.	1
Good. It works!	1
Cleans and protects leather. Not too slippery after spraying product on Would recommend, good value, protect my leather seat in my Lexus IS 300..	1
Not a tiny, cheaply made meter. This is a large meter with a clear and easy to use scale. It immediately told me that my dwell was way off, even though I had tried to set it using a feeler gauge. I won't have to do that any more. The voltmeter function is accurate (as checked with a digital DVM), and the tachometer reading matched my dash gauge exactly.	1
Cheap and easy for what I needed it for.	1
This wax works good. The only thing I didn't care for is the wax stick that it came with. The wax from the stick wipes off when it is touched.	1
couple this with ICE spray wax it's amazing.	1
Color stick helps with small boo-boos...	1
Slicker than snot on a door knob!	1
It's expensive.  But- it is one of the highest specification oils obtainable, and is definately to be considered if a person owns an older car that they want to take care of the best they can.  This and other ester-based oils are not to be confused with the big name "synthetic" oils that start out as petroleum and then manipulated into qualifying as synthetic.  Ester-based synthetics are the real deal.	1
I started using this way back since i had my very first motorcycle w/c is a 98'Honda CBR-600. When my bike hit 13,000 miles i asks around on what's the best synthetic motor oil and one of my buddies who works in a bike shop recommended this. He said that for sport bikes that revs up into the 12,000 RPMs,i need all he protection that i need for my bike engine that would not lose it's viscosity in that zone when the engine is screaming in it's full power. Using this after putting it, i noticed that the gear shifting is much more smoother & my bike has more accelerating power. When i sold that bike and bought myself a 99'Suzuki GSX-R 750, i used this same oil w/ the same exact results. I'll keep using this until i could find something better for my bikes but i doubt that i'll switch to another brand of oil. This oil has not failed me yet so far....	1
Really a fantastic oil for turbo applications. The Subaru literally cooks lesser oils. Extended drains are possible, but I usually change at the 3500-mile mark on both cars due to the boost. I've noticed a smoother idle. I run 5w30 in the Winter (Lake Tahoe) and 5w40 the rest of the year. I also love Motul 300V, but like the additives in the Red Line.	1
The only true synthetic oil available.  This stuff is a bit pricey but well worth it.  While living in Europe I had a C class Mercedes and developed a sticking lifter.  I put up with it for awhile and then changed to oil with Red Line.  The ticking noise went away instantly and never returned.	1
As described. Nice looking filter that performs well and at a cheap price. It comes with nice adapters to fit different diameter intakes and they are a nice design and look good. Filter comes pre-oiled but does NOT come with oil like the product description says.	1
so i bought this because i wanted to replace my current filter, and just decided to get this one. so i could wash it. instead of buying a new one again and again.  it fit fine, good quality filter, kinda heavy actually. one problem though, with normal driving before and after, this has decreased my MPG. i have a obd2 reader, and its kinda of weird, the air flow is higher than my original, but the fuel trim is getting higher,  also.  almost like the car is taking in more air, and has to mix more gas with that air to keep the air/fuel ratio.  its not noticed immediately, just after time, maybe a week or two, youll notice the loss of mpg, its not much, but when your only driving  3 miles to work, put 5 gal of gas in your car, which used to get you to work for a week, or so, turns into 4 days, obviously im not on a track, but i don't use AC, kick on it, anything like that. temp has been about the same, no added weight.  so to just put the variable to sleep, i had consistent milage no matter the temp outside, if i kicked on it, more people, etc.  i was getting about 22-23mpg.  i switched back to my original air filter, after a couple weeks, the mpg came back.  so its up to you, and your car how this works out for you. it does make a deep rumble sound if you kick on it, but obviously your using alot more gas doing so.  newer cars have to keep a certain air/fuel ratio. for your catalytic converter, and several other reasons. but the old cars without all the computers and stuff, i'd imagine these to work better on, but i don't have one, and cant tell you.  so good luck, looks cool, washable, sounds good, nice quality air filter, just my car in my specific situation i had a few mpg loss. may not be your situation.  i would recommend to a friend,	1
I've used these for few years on my racecar throttle body, The trim frame is real steel chrome, not rubber.  The inlet will stretch to 4" diameter (also comes with smaller adapters, stainless wire is used for the mesh construction and is also filtered on the cone end so that air can enter from the tip of the cone too.  Every bit as good as the red and black ones. Filter oil is harder to find, but I use the other brand oil (however it does mess up the color a bit).  Enough metal is in the construction that you can custom shape it a slight bit to fit under your hood if needed by bending the chrome or the mesh.  I've whacked the metal collars on the cone ends with a mallet to make mine slightly ovoid.	1
great, thanks	1
Worked alright on my wife's black car. The paint stick thing is kind of useless as it falls out of the scratches in my experience. Wear gloves unlike I did or you'll have black hands after. I've had good luck with other product that don't turn your hands black and can be used on multiple colors of cars.	1
It did not color most of the chips in my paint even with multiple aplications.	-1
Works very well!!	1
Working good so far.	1
Great price does what it is suposed to do.	1
great item	1
Perfect great price.	1
good stuff	1
It cleaned better than Mothers and Meguires. Good value and actualy works Well	1
Easy to apply. I won't claim that this is the best product but I will claim that the product is easy to apply which means I will be applying it more frequently. I feel that the best way to protect leather is consistent and frequent treatment. Formulation matters too but if your product is difficult to apply then it won't do you much good sitting in the bottle. This is one of those products that is easy to apply. This product has a smell but it isn't strong and it goes away quickly (a day or two).	1
Good stuff!	1
I bought this to relocate the speedo on my '07 Nightster. It did a hell of a job. The product is WELL worth the money (especially when relo brackets for this job cost 150 bucks, what a JOKE)  The look is REALLY nice and I imagine would suit any application, and is quality made. I didn't think twice once I got it and checked it out.  Great product.	1
I got this to relocate my speedo on my 2009 harley nightster. Fit  little loose but I used electric tape to fill the difference. I also had to widen the mount hole a little. This is a great cheap way to relocate the speedo with little to no work. I highly recommend this.	1
Worked well to relocate my 4" Harley Davidson speedo on my Sportster.  Good product, paint on bracket scratches kinda easily but whaddya gonna do?	1
Great wax	1
Works just fine.	1
THIS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND ENERGY. COMPANY REFUSED TO PAY TO RETURN IT, SO I WAS NOT GIVEN MY REFUND. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT OR THIS COMPANY.	-1
Best wax I've ever used on my black car. Amazing results. Wish the finish lasted longer then a couple of months.	1
...may not make your vehicle faster but it will probably make it louder. It does both on my '94 Dodge Cummins using the redneck intake system I fabricated. It's a pretty good filter and inexpensive enough to replace every 6 or 8 months. Easy to clean in soapy water. I recommend it.	1
product was best priced, received in no time, it was a gift and the person receiving the product has no problems with it	1
This is not as described the filter is for a 2.75 in tube is was to small wouldn't fit but very easy to return.  Ken	-1
I really like the way this looks, sounds, and performs under the hood of my Durango (stock air filtration was worthless.)  I do agree with a previous reviewer that the description could be changed from "Includes filter oil" to "Pre-oiled".  The former gives the impression that it comes with a separate can of filter oil, which could potentially be used more than once.  I also disagree with another previous reviewer that this filter isn't tough enough.  For $30, and for the average user, it's plenty tough.  I will probably buy again.	1
I bought one of these at Auto Zone to replace the filter on an AEM cold air intake on my 2007 Honda Fit... It was replaced for awhile when I installed a KraftWerks supercharger that came with a K&N oval shaped filter... I was cutting holes in my hood for hood louvers and while doing it I decided to remove some metal supporting the side of the hood and put the Spectre filter on in place of the oval shaped K&N... In both applications this filter with the conical shaped base made an improvement in performance that was very noticeable and positive...Surprisingly to me was that it improved the output with the supercharger very dramatically and it sounds pretty good too.	1
Works great use on old to20 tractor.	1
Very good	1
does what it's supposed to.no complaints.fast shipping	1
Worked fine on my old 6 volt car for dwell and tach!	1
Works great, easy to connect and read the scales. Plastic case is heavy and should be strong enough to endure heavy use. I'll find that out over time.	1
Already has improved my fuel mileage on my 00 Pontiac sunfire by over 1.5 mpg and that was from just half of a tank	1
This will pay for itself in about a year. The rest is just money in your pocket.  The only down side is having to apply K&N oil to the filter.	1
I have owned mine now for over 3 years. I could tell a difference in power as soon as I put it in. I put the K&N stickers on my airbox and love it that when I go to get oil changes I never have anyone ask me to buy a cheap overpriced disposable filter anymore. Better gas mileage too. In this time of $4 gas that's great. The filter hasn't even had to be cleaned yet. I will probably clean it tomorrow  before I go on my trip. It's easy to do. You can visit the K&N website for instructions if you've lost yours like I did because I purchased it over 3 years ago! I know it's expensive for an air filter, but in the long run it will pay for itself.	1
Work Great on Harley to Blend a few Scratches.	1
This works really well - highly recommend!!!	1
works as advertised	1
really works great on my black truck	1
Well i just collected this from the shipper and i knew what it was when i saw the box. This thing is HUGE and i am hoping that it sits just right in my engine comaprtment. If i can i will put a small clip of it on with the engine running and with me doing a couple accelerations so you and (I) can hear the attitude change LOL. Thanks amazon and i am glad i stuck with the 4incher....ricers beware...	1
It does change the attitude of your car. It does have a lot of free area for air intake.	1
Was broke both times the box was soaked with it	-1
Had one for 20 years, lost the original.  This thing is worth its weight in gold.	1
Worked very well.  Thank you much.	1
Neat little tester! It's small and portable. The tach is easy to read. The green clip IS a little flimsy but sometimes it won't read due to a loose connection, but it work's! It works ONLY on 4 cycle engines. A G M. tach. clip is included.	1
Good but a bit fragile	1
perfect	1
This is the best wax of this kind that I had used so far. If you follow the instructions in the bottle you should be able to get a good shine on your car as well as to remove the scratches.	1
I have a dark blue older BMW that has a lot of rock chips on the hood and grille.  I asked a detailed if he could fill in those spots with OEM paint.  He said the chips were too small for the paint to stick and recommended this product.  The car looks 90% better: not perfect but much better.	1
The black color in it, as well as included color stick, are purely gimmicks. They do nothing whatsoever to hide scratches. It is simply a car wax and nothing special.	-1
I can remember my Dad using this brand to wax his car when I was younger so I purchased it to wax my car.  Works great!  Easy to use!	1
It just makes sense to invest in a better way to filter air that is reusable lessening the carbon foot print!	1
Thing is great, I bought 2 just so I can clean one and let it dry completely and still use my ride, should be enough for life	1
Working good	1
Love the K&Ns, have them on all of my vehicles. Performance definitely perks up when they are used, and kept serviced/clean. Sometimes you can find deals online when other automotive parts houses have special online discounts and free shipping, but usually can't go wrong with the price from Amazon.	1
Saving gas with an increase in horsepower is always a plus. I needed to replace my air filter so i decided to go with the KandN brand. I also wanted more air flow for my snorkel. So far so good and i can actually hear the snorkel sucking in air.	1
Needed to set fuel mixture on a classic motorcycle, worked perfectly	1
so far works great as needed. Time will tell as how it holds up.	1
Wow, great shine on black convertable.  But to last must be waxed right after application.	1
Great quality, looks great and good value. I recommend seller.	1
Doesn't fill in scratches like it used to.  Light scratches from people dragging their backpacks across the side in the parking lot take a few applications to cover up.	1
Use to relocate my speed on my 2006 Sportster 1200 Custom. The bezel is easy to over tighten, so I flattened it and now it sits warped. Not a problem with the product but something to note to not over tighten when using. I'd recommend snugging it up with some locktite on the bolts.	1
Fits the Sportster speedo exact;y	1
Takes lest room then the other mount that bought.	1
Purchased this to side mount my motorcycle gauges worked like a charm	1
I have one of these in every vehicle I own. That's the first thing I add when I get a different ride.	1
Good product! If you wheel a lot in the dirt, you will ruin stock style filters quick! These are cleanable and reusable over and over, must have for wheelers!	1
Have wanted to replace my air filter in my 2001 Jeep Wrangler, for a long time.  The cost always stopped me.  I have a K & N filter in my motor home and have been very happy with it.  It is easy to keep clean and I clean it much more often than I previously replaced filters.  I also have the cleaning kit from my Motorhome filter purchase so did not have to buy the cleaning kit.	1
K&N products have always been used in our vehicles for 20+ years now....its synonymous with reliability, economy and performance. From a 2010 F150 to a 2003 chevy cavalier, they are used in our family in all sorts of vehicles...have always been happy with their products and would recommend their products always	1
I love these air filters! They last a lifetime, just wash and reuse! Don't let auto service shops talk you into a new filter every oil change, get one of these and save money.	1
i have about 5 years and 100k miles on mine, and it still looks like new, cleaned 4 times now, and it should last to the million mile mark. great price on amazon...	1
Ordered this for my 99 Pontiac sunfire. Shes an old car, but i still like to treat her right. I ordered this along with a K&N oil filter. I got this filter to help with the performance of the engine (i think it did a little, though this could be a placebo effect) But the main reason why i got it was because i would reuse it and clean it when needed. No more wasting money on FRAM filters.  My next car that i will inevitably have to get will definitely have one of these filters installed. I love the build quality of this filter too. Feels really solid.	1
Works as good as the day I bought it nearly 10 years ago, if my memory is correct.  I just wish that the cables were a bit longer since some older cars have batteries on one side and there coils on the other.  Still use it every now and then still performs like it should.  Not too much use on the new DIS and distributorless cars.	1
works good.	1
I'd love this thing, if it worked. It claims my bug idles at 400rpm, measures dwell at around 18, and the voltmeter claims my alternator charges at under 10 volts. So, all measurements are useless.  If its behavior is consistent, I suppose I could use these numbers as benchmarks for future tuneups--but it probably makes more sense to buy something else instead.	-1
replaced old ring from 20 years ago	1
was a direct replacement to mount my Autometer tachometer.looked nice.	1
Such a great alternative for doing a speedo re-locate. I have used this little mount on several projects, and will buy more.....	1
Nice replacement better than original	1
Works well.  I used it to relocate my speedometer on my 01-sportster.  Quality item.	1
I used this wax on a 2008 Lexus GS350. I bought the car new, and though I take care of the finish, it still had pits from road trips. The car is dark gray, and I used the black wax. This wax exceeded my expectations! It  overed the small road chips and shined the car beautifully.	1
Great	1
What can I say it fit my buddys 99 Tj. Lot better air flow than stock and super easy to get in and out of the air box for cleaning.	1
It does what it is supposed to do, filter the air and be a lifetime filter.  So you get what you expect, a high quality product.	1
fits perfectly and works great in my 97 jeep wrangler sport 4.0. it comes with 2 stickers too if your into that sort of thing one of them is a do not dispose sticker and the other it a k&n sticker	1
This will not net any performance improvements however it will save time and money instead of changing paper filters. I have owned many k&n products and they never disappoint.	1
what can I say. oh. fits a 2000 Jeep TJ 4 cylinder perfectly. helped with some power, especially on the highway where you need it the most with these slobs. do an exhaust system too and you'll notice a huge difference in performance.	1
All around good deal for a great product! Would not hesitate to bseller again.  Haven't calculated mileage increase, but other vehicles I have owned benefitted fro a K&N filter.	1
I originally purchased one for my Astro van.  It seemed to improve performance an fuel economy as stated.  I purchased a second one for my other vehicle, Jeep Wrangler, and it has done the same for it!	1
Purchased for my 06 Jeep Wrangler  Unlimited.  Noticed performance gains in upper RPM range. Recommend to anyone with a desire to upgrade their performance without downgrading their bank account.	1
This is really not a good light. It lasted less then 3 months..filled up with water and stopped working. Save your money.	-1
This unit will reek havoc on trucks with CAN-BUS. My 2016 F150 freaks out whe this is connected, with lighting and trailer connection errors galore. Relays click profusely.  I promtly disconnected and will be returning. It's not CAN-BUS compliant, which is very common on late model trucks.  Other details: wiring is very short, and not fully sheathed.	-1
plastic brakes apart	-1
Didn't do anything for my black VW Passat which has a number of small rock chips on the front end.  Rubbed in the wax stick then applied the polish.  Zero effect. Still can see every rock chip.	-1
car runs smother but gas mileage ? NO its using more gas now I bought Fram air filter even dough its a paper filter it works for 12000 miles and coast $10. I could drive my car 50000 miles and spend 5 Farm Filter which coast the same and do not need to wash or oil it just put it in garbage and replaced with new one , Do spent money	-1
This is not a good product, maybe good for just waxing,it doesn't hide eney scratches at all	-1
Very disappointed in this product.  Says it will cover mild scratches and swirls.  Appeared to do that upon initial application, however; within a week all scratches had re-appeared and no coverage of swirls at all.  I'd not wast my money again.	-1
Well in my state blue lights are illegal which I found out after ordering, like I need a stater pulling me over which happened to a friend who had the same hitch cover. They have a push button test you can see through the clear package, looks cheesy to me anyway, I returned it the beauty of Amazon.	-1
Does not fit a full size Chevy bench truck seat.	-1
WAY TOO SHORT!!! I'm not sure what this thing was meant to fit but the back is about 6-8 inches too short. The bottom fits fine and is good from side to side. This is on a 1987 Ford Ranger. The good thing is that it is made from good thick material so it should last a while.	-1
I really wanted to like this, and ignored all the information out there that these are high flow, low filtration filters. Thought I'd give it a try. The build quality is really good and it's very consistently assembled with nice supple seals and uniformly supported layer of filtration media and metal screen. Unfortunately, after 10,000 miles or so, some including heavy towing, there is a visible coating of fine dust all over the downstream side of the intake tract. It's visible to the naked eye and can be wiped and viewed on your finger tips.	-1
Didn't work so I returned it.	-1
Didnt work in the slightest for covering up scratches on motorcycle fairing (plastic) or the gas tank (metal). The wax itself just enhanced them, making everything around them shiny, and the chip stick just made it look like they had been colored in with a crayon The shine on the intact parts was good, but in contrast to other reviews this really didn't work at hiding any scratches.	-1
i couldn't wait for this from amazon so i bought it at the store.  what it excels at is making your hands black, and anything you touch black. this includes your buffing mitt or whatever microfiber cloth you are using.  you get the same effect as a spray wax. it's not lasting and it comes off easy.  if you want decent wax, get turtlewax hard shell. then pour some black ritt dye into it and you have your own black polish but it lasts longer than a few days.  i wouldnt do that if i were you, though.	-1
I have a '11 Ford Flex. I tried twice to get this product to work and it failed both times. First time, after I installed it, it worked as advertised: nice blue Ford logo switched to red oval when you pressed the brake. But after the first test, the blue light quit working. I sent it back and got a replacement. Again, at first it worked properly but then both blue and red lights quit. I sent it back and bought something else. I do not know if it was 2 defective lights or it just didn't work on my vehicle.	-1
These filters look nice, but the construction just isn't what I was expecting. The filter media is much thinner than most of the other inverted cone filters that I've used, and while this technically does not negatively affect the filtration, I do not trust it to hold up in the engine bay. The finish on the outside was good, but inside several wire mesh strands were dangling from where the epoxy and end caps meet. The only reason I won't be returning these is because they work well on my air compressor.  I will not be using them on my vehicles.	-1
I had some pesky swirls that I wanted to remove and I didn't have time to do a full 3 step polish compound wax. So I tried this thing out. As a filler/dye wax, it's supposed to put color into the small scratches and swirls. I followed the instructions, washed the car, dried, then applied thinly with a microfiber applicator and waited for it to dry. After doing the swipe test, (rubbing a clean finger across the dried wax to see if it's okay to remove) I began to remove it. It was CRAZY hard. Bits and pieces stuck to the car and getting it off caused EVEN MORE SWIRLS AND SCRATCHES THAN BEFORE. Not to mention, it is a dye wax so anything it touches will be stained black. I knew this going in so I made sure to use black microfibers and such, but it makes this product even worse.  Fortunately I was able to remove the new swirls with Meguiar's ColorX, but I will never use this thing again. And the Chipstik? It's literally a black crayon/lipstick that you rub into the scratches. If you care at all about your car, stay away.	-1
This product did nothing for my car in fact it made it worse. I wouldn't use again. What a mess!	-1
JUST GOT THIS BAD BOY FOR MY 91 F150 XLT LARIAT l6 4.9. runs way smoother then before and i notice that the rpms are a little smoother when changeing gears update 2/15/14 just failed on me a few weeks back, had to get towed home not worth the money	-1
I tried this on relatively new Mercedes Benz with black paint.  The "Chip Stick" is basically a black crayon or tube of hard black lipstick.  It works somewhat, but doesn't solve the problem of chipped paint.  Only touch-up paint can do that.  I guess if someone wants to fill the chip with black wax that will melt or fade in a few weeks, they could use the sick.  The black wax is no better than any other wax.  It also stains all of your applicators and buffing cloths black.  I compared this wax side-by-side with Meguiar's Gold Class Clear Coat Wax Liquid.  Meguiar's still is the gold standard and, with a black paint job, it's the only wax I've found that will totally eliminate swirl marks and give me that glossy liquid black look.	-1
The Accel coil adapter  was problematic, the black plastic the hard-shell connecter was made of was as brittle as a old connecter on a car with 150,000 miles on it driven in the desert, the first time I tried to remove the adapter from the coil the exterior detent clip broke off, the fit to the coil was still tight, which is good, however the detent holding the power wire inside the hard shell connector was missing so the green wire pushed out of the connector causing more need for mind numbing diagnosis. hours of wasted time figuring out he part I just replaced was defective. After finding the problem I also noted the crimp of the wires soldered and flattened  that made for a very poor crimp. If you are just replacing the coil to a performance coil or to a older style coil this may work for you if you don't intend on doing more work on or around the coil. I would not recommend this product.	-1
It does the job up to a point. I have had this item in use for just over a year now. If you have a turbo, take warning!!! The fancy chrome center piece in the middle of the cone can come loose and very well cause severe damage to your turbo by being sucked in. At 1st I thought my turbo was bad, and this is what I found. I got lucky, no turbo damage. The manufacturer needs to look at a better adhesive that holds on the chrome pieces.	-1
The manufactures of MSD Ignition 8227 Blaster TFI Coil have obviously started making it cheaper and with inferior materials.  The picture of this coil is of the older ones ( black and red) and there are better made I have two and they are still working fine.  In spite of the picture the new MSD Blaster coils are a solid bright orange, lighter and cheaper made.   I know as I ordered one of the newer solid orange MSD coils and it overheated and failed in about three months. Left me in the middle of the street. Luckily I had  and old stock coil with me and was able to change this junk out right there and got us going again. Beware!!   Update,  I have included a picture of the coil you receive, as you can see it is not the same one pictured when you order.  The set of orange twins pictured are both dead and useless, within less than a year. Please do not buy this coil. It is a waste of your money and will leave you walking as both of these did me. As I said earlier they are cheaply made, light weight and all but useless.  To MSD's credit if you can find the black and red coil on the order page it is a much better coil, I still have two of those and are working fine still.	-1
I bought this to allow use of the Accel 140021 Super coil on my 2001 Dodge Dakota. I installed it and 4 months later I was driving when my truck just shut down and would not restart. I had to be towed to a garage where they proceeded to troubleshoot the problem. It turned out that one of the wires in this adapter is broken. I had to reinstall my stock coil.  I called ACCEL about getting another adapter and they would not do replace it. So beware !  I will try to replace the bad wire on my own.	-1
should have been included with coil interesting the coil itself makes no mention of needing it on the product page however once received it is marked plainly on the box	-1
I can't tell you that I definitively felt any difference up front but it did install easily and worked initially. After about 8 months and 3000 miles, this part failed on me leaving me stranded on the side of the road in my RV. The total diagnosis and repair totalled about $1500 including towing. My guarantee allows me to return this one and get a replacement. $40 versus $1500 doesn't seem to make this a good bet. Electrical system problems can be a bear to diagnose. In retrospect, I would recommend going with Motorcraft (or maybe Delphi).	-1
No instructions included. If it fits properly, I couldn't make it.	-1
I didn't buy this off Amazon, instead I bought it at O'reilly, only because I didn't feel like waiting for it to be delivered.  Anyway, anyone on here that says it is easy to install if full of it. It comes with 2 adapters. One for 3 inch intakes, and one for 3.5 inch intake, and if you use no adapter then it fits on 4.5 inch intakes. Well, my intake is 3.25 inch so I tried using the 3.5 inch adapter. Tightening the hose clamp all the way and there was still about a half inch gap between the filter and the intake tubing so instead I ended up not going with either adapter. I put a spare coupler onto the end of the tubing, put the filter on and tightening the hose clamp all the way. So far it works but wish they had made the adapter better.	-1
actually what I got in the mail from this company is not at all what is shown in the picture. the seat cover almost fit after I had to do some extreme modification to get it to slightly fit. the top and bottom were sewn wrong to fit to my seat and the tan portion is a rainbow blend of different colors of stringy thread, but the weave is nice if that's what you are going for.  The left and right sides were also sewn in a fashion that I can only imagine is due to unskilled labor or the blind. don't buy this if you have a large truck either. I am thinking it would be better fit for a 1/4 ton truck than a 3/4 ton or larger truck.	-1
Terrible, terrible cover. It is really small and the quality is so poor. Ends are just folded and sewn. Vinyl trim is already folding up on edges exposing the white backing. One small seam to hold on the trim. No effort at all to make it nice. I bought this to dress up a truck I am selling and it is embarrassing to look at. Immediate return on this puppy. Spend a few more dollars on something better than this.	-1
Ok First off - I was not using this on the seat it was intended for. I used this on a 2015 rear bench seat. I grew up on the farm with these things and the seat covers from 25 years ago are still being used and look good. So thought these were the same NOT THE CASE!. THE GOOD - The material its self is sturdy -and it actually looks really good. The BAD - CHEAP! The slots where the seat belt pokes though is nothing more then pleather sewed around a hole. Looks unfinished - the pleather was just sewed on the seams weren't hidden - they just stick right out - I thought I had it inside out or something but same thing on other side. 2nd BAD - the cords that attach snap right off with little to no effort.  I wasn't going to go through the trouble of trying to find another cover so I just broke out the sewing machine and attached all new loops made out of 1.2" tie down straps for attaching and used a parachute cord to weave the all the loops together. then i just pulled the pleather crap off and sewed the holes shut. I made it work but Im disappointed.  The fact Im using this on the wrong type of seat makes no difference what so ever to the quality of this cheap knock off.  2015 XLT Z71 Crew Cab	-1
Didn't fit my truck very well got it on one side and then it wouldn't pull down on the other who ever makes these needs to learn how to measure	-1
Look closely at the picture provided. This is clearly for a mini - to mid size bench seat. Yes it's inexpensive. Yes it's "universal". But, when all is said and done, wouldn't you want accuracy in the description of the product you are buying? Move on, find something better if you need to cover a bench seat in any vehicle with size. Too bad, I thought Saddleman would be one of the brands you could trust to decribe their own product accurately. I would have paid more, if they told me too. Just give me the option of buying the right item. Yeah, I'm not going to waste my time - returning it, finding another, etc. etc. - Just DONT BUY THIS FOR FULL IZE APPLICATION	-1

Bought this item at Pep Boys and on my first air filter change I found the ring warped -- looks like heat go to it.  Would not recommend this to anyone.  The other two reviews talk about "adapters" (plural) this discription is "adapter" (singular), and I am confused by their review, not knowing what "adapters" they expected to come with this?  Does air filter risers come with something else normally?  I understand the discription to mean the rings "adapt" to the carb/air filter can, adapting one to the other.  Don't know, just wondering? Now the CRIME, if you go and find the metal risers they are silly expensive -- SO, I got a tin can and cut it with metal tin snips to the height I needed and it worked fine and it did not cost $30 rip off.  Stay away from the plastic pieces with all of the extra pieces which you will not use.  I saw someone on ebay selling the extra rings for $5, something to think about, of course, you might need all three rings, that adaptability is nice.	-1
The Item description, at the time of writing (08/11/2013), is incorrect. This item number/package does not include the adapters. It is only the riser kit. You get 3 different sized risers. Sent it back and went with the Mr. Gasket set. I will update once that is received.  Update: The Mr. Gasket set does indeed include the adapters. It is cheap, but it works.	-1
These grommets didn't fit my 81 Chev K-10 305ci.  A person has to be careful when orderings these grommets for size and a good picture to look at the outside and inside of the grommet. For the right application I think they are made well	-1
10PSI max. So it's basically good for a lawnmower. Does not belong in automotive section.	-1
The web site does not specify which type engines this works with, yet the packaging has written on the back "NOT for use with fuel injected engines", which eliminates the last 20 years of cars.  Amazon needs to list this in the ad so others do not have to return it as I did.	-1

I bought this K&N air filter last year and have sinced cleaned it once and used it approximately 40,000 miles.  I took it out to clean it for the second time and much to my displeasure found that the filter element was separated from the rubber surround in a few places.  This means that unfiltered air was getting into my engine for how long I have no idea.  I did email K&N directly a couple of times and they never returned my emails.  I would have been happy with getting at least 100,000 miles out of this but for this price it's a piece of junk.  To all the K&N fans who will probably question what I'm telling, yes I did get the K&N cleaning kit and yes I did follow the instructions to the "T".  I bet many more filters out there are failing but people just don't realize it.  I will never buy another K&N product again.	-1
I was not impressed with the quality.  There was over-molded material on the edges (clearly the result of sloppy casting) which I had to remove with a knife for a proper fit. Additionally, one of the metal supports at the end was not properly covered with rubber, and needed to be pushed back into place. Time will tell if it is a superior filter to the Spectre it replaced...	-1
had put this in for like 10 mos. on my 2006 crv and it plummeted my gas consumption to an avg of 17 mpg.the oem filter atleast was giving me 20.didnt notice any upgrade in driving performance especially on hard throttle.will not buy anymore kn filters as i think it is overhyped especially for honda engines like the crv.	-1
not impressed. woulden't buy another and don't like this one.  If you have to get an alarm, save your money and get a good one the first time.	-1
Don't work	-1
This alarm is useless. The sound level of an alarm should be loud enough for someone to hear it. Thus is about as loud as a watch alarm clock.	-1
This stuff is available everywhere for cheap.  It is very difficult to work with.  Buffing it off creates a huge mess and a lot of effort is required.  The shine it provides is pretty good but only lasts about a week at most.  After that the water beading properties seem to go away.  Spend your money on something from Mothers or Meguiars and you'll be greeted with a longer lasting shine that is easier to work with.	-1
Cheap product that does not fit well due to unnecessary bends in the hard tube.	-1
Made in China and very cheaply made. I bought this and Dorman 46003 to fix a leaking vacuum hose. Well, this stuff is far from OEM new Jeep/Mopar stuff. One of the little tabs broke off when I tried clipping it to the other piece. Plus, the biggest hose in this part that goes to the valve cover is way too long. Also, the short piece of vacuum line that goes from the fuel pressure regulator to the intake is sized too large. I would up putting the old hose back on so I would not have a vacuum leak.  I was able to break the seal on that rubber boot that fits on the largest tube, slide it down and make it work. But, I shouldn't have to do that, it's clear the quality control on this part is not very high.	-1
Very weak alarm. Wires on unit should be longer. I had to extend mine. Seems to have a mind of its own.. If you know  what I mean . I would not buy again or recommend. It's  good to locate your car. UPDATE!  The alarm randomly went off during the night even when it was disarmed!  I'm taking it out.  Do not waste your money.	-1
This Alarm goes off way to easily and also the remote has to be almost on top of the car for it to arm and disarm..  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.. the only good thing about it is that its a very simple install..	-1
I decided to wax my wife's new, always garaged, all black, always clean, car. Consumer Reports rated Black Magic Liquid Wax, #48016 as the best in their 2006 report but gave it just the middle rating for removal. Easy on but not so easy to remove. How, oh so true that is. Washed the car twice. First time I used the BM recommended car wash product, the second time using just cold water. Dried the car with 100% cotton towels. In the shade on a 74 degree afternoon, 55% relative humidity, no wind, and a cool car exterior, I applied the wax, per the manufacturers written directions printed on the bottle's label. The directions state, "Shake bottle well....wax your vehicle in the shade while the vehicle surface is cool. Wash vehicle with Black Magic Wet Shine Car Wash. Dry thoroughly." The directions also state the wax is, "Formulated for easy-to-use application by hand or buffer/polisher."  More about this later. Anyway, I did all the above. When the car is clean and cooled off, ready to be waxed, there are three printed steps for application and removal. They are: "1. Pour a small amount of .... wax on a 100% cotton pad or foam applicator. 2. Apply a thin layer of wax in a firm circular motion. Do one section at a time, covering evenly and thoroughly. LET DRY TO A HAZE. 3. Wipe to a deep, brilliant shine with a clean, dry 100% cotton cloth or microfiber towel, turning cloth frequently to prevent residue build-up."  NOTICE that the directions state the wax is "Formulated for easy-to-use application...." NOTHING IS INDICATED ABOUT EASE OF REMOVAL. This is because it is NOT EASY TO REMOVE. It is, in fact, the most difficult wax I have ever tried to remove. This wax will NOT dry. Never. The sun will fade away and the earth will turn to a frozen rock and this wax will still be wet. Cold, but still wet. Try to remove it with a dry 100% cotton towel or a microfiber cloth and you will buff until you have biceps the current Governor of California would have envied in his glory days, or advanced arthritis before your time.  If you, like me, follow the manufacturer's directions printed on the back of the bottle, you will come to hate this wax and your shoulder's will torture you in the morning. I decided to give this red and black, almost full bottle, to our neighbor for use on his target range. A police officer, I thought he might be able to make better use of it then I was able to. On the way over to his house and thinking about the satisfaction I was going to obtain, I had a flash back to what another reviewer has shared.  If you use the following procedure, his, you will in fact enjoy a nice easy application, an easy removal and a deep, glossy shine. You might even come to like this wax. It is unfortunate that the original directions were obviously writen by a Washington politician and we all know what they say is relevant only to what they think you want to hear. Never mind the truth.  So, for an easier time of it, do the following. 1. Shake the bottle for 1-2 minutes. 2. Thoroughly wet a clean 100% cotton pad or a clean foam applicator pad. Wring it out so it is wet but not dripping. 3. Pour a small amount of wax on the pad. Immediately apply with a firm circular motion to a cool, clean, surface. Cover a large enough area that you have a thin, consistent, glaze over the surface. Avoid heavy deposits that leave thick streaks of polish. 3. Immediately use a clean, dry, soft, 100% cotton cloth or a microfiber towel and buff the wax off. It will dry and come off fairly rapidly and easily and you will have a very nice shine.  This does work. Whether or not this procedure will allow the wax to last any longer than the excellent carnuaba paste Kit Wax shine, super easy to appply and buff out, is not known. But, the above will work with the Black Magic Wet Shine Liquid Wax wax and give very nice results with modest effort. If the manufacturer's directions were worth reading I would have given it four stars. Maybe even five.	-1
I've been waxing my cars six or more times a year for the past 46 years and I would rate this wax as one of the toughest waxes I've ever used to remove and get a good clean shine. My present car is deep maroon and it was practically impossible to get this wax to clean up without getting swirl marks and smears. I'm not one to write reviews but after doing the two sides on my white van and the hood and roof on my maroon vehicle I felt it was in my own best interest to throw the remainder in the trash. After the elbow grease I used I felt the results were not worth the efffort used. I have used the old Blue Coral in the past which is a three or four step process and I think that was easier than this. I don't know how this product was rated so high but I'll use Turtle wax carnauba anyday over this. Incidently the temperature when I applied this was 67 degrees which in my opinion is perfect for waxing. Give it a try , it's not expensive but if I were you I'd stick with whatever you've been happy with in the past or if you want something new , try Turtle wax carnauba. In my opinion you won't be sorry.	-1
Great filters but this does not fit dodge promaster 2015 1500. Van .  K and n says it fits but it doesn't not even the same shape as stock filter	-1
After reading all the reviews, I had to try it. Well, it went on easy enough and cleaned up smudges in the paint that didn't come out in the wash. BUT... never set up well. It gummed up my terry cloth buffer to the point I had to throw it away. Used up 4 more buffers before I got it all off. The car finally had a nice shine when I got all the gummy residue off. We'll see how long it lasts... But I won't be using it again.	-1
terrible	-1
I bought this and Dorman 46004 to fix a leaking vacuum hose. Well, this stuff is garbage, buy OEM stuff instead. One of the little tabs broke off when I tried clipping it to the other piece. I'll admit this piece seemed to fit better than the other section of vacuum hoses, but the large hose is really difficult to install on the air cleaner.  If I could give it zero stars, I would, that's what it deserves. Now I'm out the cash for this crappy part and will wind up more buying the OEM part. This Dorman stuff is made in China and very cheaply made. I've had better success with other Dorman products, however.	-1

I tried this as I accidentidly thought it said turtle wax carnauba car wax and not Carnauba cleaner wax, it goes on ok, but is the hardest way to rub off, though at least it's cheap, no more than $7 wasted. Definitely will not buy again, if this wax was not so to take off, I would have gave it 5 stars, but this 1 flaw since it is so huge, has dragged down my score on it. For those of you who did purchase this and find the wax hard to buff off, to use it up, I recommend using it on areas of the car where nobody sees such as the bottom, the bumpers, and the roof, no need to waste time trying to buff it off since extra wax left on will not any harm.	-1
This does nothing the paper filter doesn't do. Its not like you are going to beat Don Garlitts after putting a tacticool filter on your truck.	-1
These bolt are not intended to be used on 10 bolt 2004 Chevrolet Silverado differential rear end.  Not only did I fight all the way with an impact wrench to remove the old bolts, but I assumed when you buy the differential cover and a cover gasket which were the right ones, the bolts would be the right ones, they were not, they were Sae thread and mine were metric threads. I started all the bolts in by hand and then like an idiot that I must be for not checking first,I used the impact to finish the job until two of them sheared the heads off, there were 4 extra bolts left which I compared to the old ones with rounded off heads, this is when I realized what I had done ,now its too late and I am not taking them back out as I will probably break more off trying to do so, I filled it with gear oil and it's not leaking for now, Thank God ! This product should not have been sold with the Doorman cover for this vehicle	-1

This is the first Spectre product I've been disappointed in.  I expected it to be an inexpensive knock off, with the same mounting dimensions as the Hurst Super Boot.  The mounting pattern does not match and will only work if new mounting holes are drilled.  Also, the rubber is so thick and stiff it doesn't work very well as a shift boot.  I do not recommend this product.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Spectre-6284-Universal-Rectangular-Large-Shift-Boot/dp/B00062ZI2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Spectre 6284 Universal Rectangular Large Shift Boot</a>	-1

I am trying to use these but they are of very poor quality.  When you squeeze the tangs together, the side with only one bends more than the other and rather than keeping a circular shape, the clip becomes somewhat of an oval.  This makes it had to slide the clip over the round tubing.  Also, the single tang stays bent a little bit that way, reducing the force on the tube and also making it difficult to remove, since your pliers will want to slide off the side with two tangs (the bend in the side with one tang will be above the top of the double tangs).  if you will only put them on and never touch them again they might be ok but I wanted spring clamps so that I could remove them fairly easily.	-1

If you're looking for a "narrow far reaching beam", look elsewhere. These lights do not produce any real output. They are good if you only want to "look cool".  As stated in another review, these are the same lights as sold in AutoZone or AdvanceAuto stores.  The housing is made from pretty durable plastic, and the lens is glass.  It comes with a wiring harness that can be used, but is of a low AWG wire.  They are pretty shallow in depth, allowing you to mount them virtually anywhere.	-1

You want to buy this? OK, just remember it's your problem if it fails and something serious happens. My experience with this product could of caused a serious fire. I always liked these filters and decided I wanted one. After installation things were great, until I began cleaning the filter on scheduled times. One day I noticed the thread cut on the metal casted device that the 2 end caps are held onto with was mis-manufactured. One side was tapped correctly with deep quality thread cuts. The other had shallower and less quality threading done to it. This imperfection caused the filter to loosen over a short period and started leaking small amounts of fuel through the seals. We are not talking water leaking, this is raw fuel into the engine compartment while driving. Since I always have my eyes looking into the engine bay and maintaining my vehicles, I caught this possible disaster before the ultimate destruction, a fire. I removed the bad quality device and repaired the gap in the hose and feel much more safer. DO yourself a favor and always buy manufactured machine sealed fuel filters so you don't end up a statistic BBQ.	-1
Flimsy construction, and as others have pointed out a carb thats running a little rich will burn up the foam (which by the way is already falling apart once it's older). Once that starts melting off with the heat that smess will clog up your fuel lines quick.  These are junk.	-1
I have been in auto parts and care chemicals since 1975 and I can assure you that BM 41023 DOES NOT "DISSOLVE" brake dust !! I was also an ASE Master auto Tech for 12 years. Brake dust is composed of steel dust (from rotor wear), carbon (from pad wear), steel fibers (from pad wear) and asbestos (from pad wear). I would really like to see a compound that "dissolves" ANY of these materials, much less ALL of them!	-1
COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME & MONEY. I'm not kidding or being sarcastic, the product has a 4 step process and the last 2 are both scrub your wheels. 1. spray on cool dry wheels 2. wait 2 minutes 3. wipe away brake dust and grime (wait, isn't that scrubbing?) 4. extreme buildup may require agitation with a brush (the company had to think hard of a word to say scrub without saying scrub here)  After applying as instructed, waiting and then spraying with a hose my wheels looked no cleaner than if I had just sprayed them with the hose without the product at all. Which is to say they looked dirty and wet.  The scrubbing also wasn't any easier after applying this product than it is when I don't use this product.  A power washer is the only method I've found where you can get fairly clean wheels without scrubbing. It's not as good as scrubbing, and getting the waster out, hooking it up and putting it away is a pain but at least it's less effort than sitting for 10 minutes and working up a sweat next to each wheel.	-1
Don't use messed up my rims.	-1
Didn't buy from Amazon, bought from another store.  I had a healthy amount of break dust built up on my front wheels (they're light-gray) and a small amount built up on the rear wheels, this did nothing to remove the break dust from either wheel.  I followed the instructions: Spray on to a cool, dry surface, let sit 1-2 minutes, spray off; this cleaned very little, if nothing, from the rims. I faintly remember trying something like this in the past and being very disappointed, I couldn't remember the brand, but this may have been it; I recently decided to try again with a wheel cleaner, this may have been the same cleaner I used in the past.  It is imperative that you are careful with cleaning solutions like these because they can damage the coating on your wheels so I was extremely cautios about the time that I let it sit. I first used the 'shower' setting on my sprayer but quickly switched to the 'jet' setting and saw no difference. I'm not sure what this is supposed to remove, but it apparently doesn't remove brake dust.  Stick to the manual method of using a soapy mit or sponge to remove the brake dust build-up.	-1
How do you market and sell a product that doesn't do anything? It's pure idiocy because now I will avoid ALL Black Magic products. We tried this on our Hellcat and Audi, only to find that it does nothing that plain soapy water won't do just as well. I'm not exaggerating; this is a useless product. Zero stars and the company has to know that this doesn't work, so shame on them for STEALING money from car owners.	-1
I bought this along with armor all quicksilver. While this did take off some dirt and grime, it left a lot on the rims. It might have loosened it up for removal during brushing, but according to the bottle you shouldn't need to do this.  I did a head to head test of the armor all vs black magic. Armor says to let it sit 5 minutes. This stuff, 1-2. After about 30 seconds, this stuff is entirely off the tires- without even hosing off. The armor all was still there after the 5 minute period. Of the two, I would select armor all, but it was more expensive, about $8.  The only good thing is that it sprays a lot, so you don't need to use as many sprays which should save product. Sadly, I went back through with the armor all to clean up the spots this couldn't handle. Black magic will make your wheel cleaner, but you need to put in more effort to make it look "almost new" clean.	-1
may as well spray rose water on your wheels and pretend they got super clean, this thing does "nothing" virtually. I tried in different ways, dry wheels, wet wheels, cold water, hot water... It doesn't work period. So take your 5 bucks and burn them while you drink a beer instead.	-1
Black Magic advertises "No Scrub". This is correct because even if you scrub your wheels after using this product, you will still have brake dust. Another review on here is perfect, "The "Black" is the brake dust that will still be stuck to your wheels after you use this product. The "Magic" must be the money that disappears from your wallet and goes to the dishonest corporation that markets this junk."  If you own dawn dish washing soap please use that before buying this stuff, it is total crap. I emptied to bottle and refilled it with dawn and water, works much better!	-1
Its OK if you scrub it on light brake dust.  But it does make your wheels shine but if you have heavy brake dust forget it!	-1
Used this product on different cars with different wheels.  This product never work; not even a little cleaning.  DO NOT buy this!!!!  I am throwing mine away, not even worth keeping.  It deserves zero star.	-1
I bought several bottles of this product based on the description. It is pure junk. I could not get this product off my wheels until I used another product to remove it. I threw every bit of it in the trash can. Do not buy this product you will be very unhappy with it.	-1
Have used different wheel cleaners over the years - picked this up on special somewhere - and it's no better than soap and water.  A good wheel cleaner should take the brake dust down to the tire - a soso cleaner should at least loosen the stuff in a uniform fashion so you can get it with a sponge - this stuff really does nearly nothing, it actually kinda gums up little rays of it on the wheel, making it a little more of a pain to get the concentrated spots off.	-1
So, far I've tried all the "off the shelf" available at my local department store sprays in an effort to keep my aluminum wheels clean. Of the 4 or so I've used this is the worst. It does almost nothing. Other sprays, Eagle One, Mothers, Meguiars, at least worked to some degree and were at least useable. This is not even worth finishing the bottle. Sad since I really like Black Magic wheel black.	-1
didnt last a year	-1
K&N claims that there filters have less restriction on air flow which is true, but what they don't tell you is with less restriction come dirtier air. You can void your warranty because they do not filter out particles as well as oem. To say you get more horse power because the oem is somehow starving the engine for air is crazy. The normal auto engine does not require the air flow that a K&N filter has and it is not worth the dirt and damage dirt can do to an engine over time. Independent studies show that K&N does not perform as well as oem and K&N can not prove differently. Although there is not studies on every oem filter you can imagine that if the studies that have been done show that k&N lets in more dirt than oem that the auto manufacturer will void the warranty if problems arise in the induction system.

You need to be informed that these locks are not compatable for all HiLites.  For instance, I purchased from Amazon HiLites #174, KC 121 Long range, Slimlights.  The bolt on the Slimlite is smaller than the bolts on the full size lights and some others.  This information is available on some of the other seller's web sites.  As always, no matter how much you think that this is the product that is correct for your vehicle, do your homework, visit other sites and gather all of the other information that you can, do not strictly rely on Amazons short description.  Save yourself problems down the road.  Then come back to Amazon and buy them at a great price with the free shipping!!!  In addition, a contact the the manufacturer reveals that they do not offer a lock like this for the Slimlites.  I don't know why, every one wants to secure their expensive lights from theft.  If I find a product that will work, I will try to revise this feedback.  Purchased in April 2011 for 2004 Ford Ranger FX4 with a Westin Sportsman  brushguard.	-1
I followed the instructions perfectly, but the mesh twisted and trying to fit the chrome ends on is a pain. I ended up getting plain old hose.	-1
Does not PERFECTLY FIT a 2012 GL-450 even though it says so. It fits in the wells of each side of the plastics but you cannot screw all the bolts down as the rubber trim of the filters are too large.  Compare it with the OEM filter and you will see.  I am in the process of evenly tightening the screws down without stripping the plastics or warping anything.  I hope the whole plastic engine cover will snugly fit well over the engine even with several millimeter discrepancy.  I also hope the gaps the filter is causing between the "two plastic pieces" will not allow air flow. As any gl-450 owner knows, its a hassle to change these filters out as you have to disassemble the tower bar and such.  Not really a pain in the butt but it's not like switching out an air filter on a honda.  I recommend DO NOT BUY from this post as it is inaccurate fitment.	-1
Was wrong one.	-1
This is the second K&N filter that won't fit my cars. K&N really needs to work on their design. The original Toyota filter fits nicely. Some OEM filter also fits nicely but not this high performance one.	-1
I tried this product on two vehicles. It did not work on either of them. One leak was tiny at the rear main seal and the other was much worse and coming from multiple areas. Don't waste your money!	-1
Has to be modified to fit standard holley carburetor  soldering is inconsistent,  im not going to be surprized if it leaks as well	-1
Slime did not work for me.  When I contacted the company, I got the return email below.  Below that, you will see the original email I sent to the company to see if I they can help me resolve the problem.  Slime made my problem go from bad to worse.  However, the pump works well (average would be 3 but deducted one star for making my tire wobble).  From: Karen Bechtold <kbechtold@slime.com> To: XXXXX@yahoo.com Sent: Friday, November 11, 2011 6:50 PM Subject: re: New submission from Contact Inquiry Form  Thank you for contacting SLiME! If the plug is leaking, that tells me that it does not have a good seal. Slime is compatible with plugs, but if the plug is leaking, it can be rather difficult for the sealant effectively to treat the puncture. Tire plugs and tire sealant are temporary repairs and if the tire is still leaking we would suggest that they remove the plug so the sealant can work with the memory of the tire to seal the puncture. While the instructions do not state to remove a tire plug, they also do not say to use it with a plug. On the other hand, the liquid nature of the sealant can cause vibrations (as noted on the warning label). Since you are experiencing wobbling/vibration issues, the only way to remedy the situation is to remove the sealant. The tire should be repaired with a plug/patch from the inside of the tire after the sealant is removed. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us.

However, after about two months, the plug did not hold up and tire developed a slow leak at the same punctured spot. So instead of going back, I used sealant from the kit I had purchased from Amazon in May, hoping this would fix the tire.  I followed instructions as shown on the product brochure and made sure puncture was at 6 oclock position and after putting in the solution, I ran the car in slow stop and go motion for good 2 miles and sped up to distribute the solution evenly. Now the tire feels heavier, noisier and wobbles like it is out of balance but the air still leaks from the spot I wanted to plug with this product. I initially thought maybe I should take the plug out but the plug had worn evenly with the tire and it was impossible using needle nose plier and since your instruction did not specify that plug needs to come out so I left it there. Your product seems to have overall good reviews but it did not work in my situation. If plug being in the tire is the problem, you should address that with your instructions. Now I feel that the only way to resolve this is to replace my tire.  I don't know what you can do to resolve this but I just wanted you to know about my situation for future product development or instruction update.	-1
Looks cheap wouldn't put it on my 2014 ss camaro looks out dated	-1
I installed this product friday nite (7/7). I drove 135 miles and it failed on the road about 65 miles from home. Luckily I had my old coil in my Jeep because I had read some of the previous reviews about premature failure and was able to tie it in place w/ some 550 cord I had to get me home. I tied it in because the hardware was too hot to install the O'Reillys house brand of coil that was functioning just fine. I'm terribly disappointed in this coil as I have had MSD in my Jeep before and it was great. I will be returning this to the vendor hopefully for a full refund. This is a MSD problem, not a vendor problem, but hopefully they will make this right. I am attaching photos of this coil installed on the rail, and the el-cheapo coil hanging in front of it, hooked up to get me home.	-1
I put this on along with new plugs and plug wires and it started right away.  While it was running I drove to my no ethanol gas station about 10 miles away, didn't shut it off while refueling and drove it home.  When I get home I shut it off in the driveway and wanted to see how quickly it would start back up so I tried to start my car.  It would not start!!!!  I cranked for over 5 seconds and stopped.  I popped the hood to check all my connections and all looked good.  So I came inside for about 10 minutes and went back out and it did start after about 2 seconds of cranking,,,about a second longer than the Accel I removed.  WTF!!!!?	-1
Anyone whom states they get more performance from this is lying. Physics law only conducts so much spark through a given point regardless of the coil. Don't buy stick to OEM!	-1
Don't waste your money on this coil zj guys. This makes the 4th one in a 3yr period. And iv ordered 4 Accel coils there all junk. This last msd coil lasted 2days then left me stranded on the hwy at rush hour traffic in Norfolk VA. just lucky i had the 17yr old stock coil with me to get home. Don't buy this coil! They SUCK! Don't know why I thought they would be better after the 8th one?	-1
Picked up 2 bottles of this for my wife's Explorer which had a Rough Idle & she just filled up with  Ethanol Regular..  . Didn't do a dang thing... Auto Zone claims I got a dollar off at 5.99  but if I look at the price above I got shellacked.  Like the other reviewer says you can get 2 qts of TECHRON at Costco for 5.99 for fuel Injector cleaner. Thought I heard a Valve not seating right in my wife's engine. This didn't do anything to quiet that either.	-1
Hmmm, not sure this did anything. You try so many brands, you get used to paying more attention to the car after you pour it into your tank, and you hope--and hope--but I can't say I noticed any difference with this.	-1
After installing this coil on my 1996 jeep cherokee,I noticed the black plastic plug did not fit tightly as in the oem coil,after installation,took on drive & cut out & would not restart?had someone wiggle plug while starting & it started,decided to return home,while driving,kept cutting out,needed someone to wiggle plug.removed this coil & installed a new oem coil,problem solved.	-1
I've used the US version and thought it had great quality.  This is made in China and in my opinion isn't as good	-1
DO NOT BUY!!! PRODUCT CAME WITH NO SAFETY SEAL. THERE COULD BE ANYTHING IN HERE, I WILL NOT PUT IT IN MY ENGINE!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!	-1
I'm not sure WHAT was shipped to me but it didn't seem to be Lucas Fuel Treatment. Danger aside, it was shipped with the caps just secure enough so they wouldn't spill. There was no safety seal under the caps, and it was completely odorless. The majority of my views on Amazon.com are 5 star reviews, but this one was not. I love Lucas products and expected to write a very positive review. Hopefully this matter will be resolved or at least explained.	-1
No noticeable performance.	-1
None of these fit my 2000 ford explorer 5.0 302. Wrong lengths. No matches. Go to lowes and they have all the right size 5/16 stainless bolts. You may have to stick a lock washer on a couple to make them fit perfect but no big deal.	-1
Not one stud or bolt fit a 97 Ford Explorer 5.0	-1

Cleans like normal All purpose cleaner but still less than most of them !! Never will buy again!!	-1
Old stock, this stuff was dried and clumpy. That's what you get here though, B quality items that couldn't be sold in a retail store. Thanks online shopping	-1
This product doesn't clean much. It's a very mild cleaner. If you're cleaning leather work boots it won't do the job. Nor will it do well cleaning leather car seats.	-1
It's like another brand to me	-1
This cloth is not great. It's Costco quality. It even warns you that the edging may scratch paint. 10 years ago this would have been impressive, but nowdays there are much better options. It's just a microfiber cloth, it's not even particularly large, dense, or good. I bet the bag costs as much as the cloth to make.	-1
didnt work too well	-1
I wrongly assumed that this tube would fit my lawn tractor's front tire, which had begun leaking.  After all, the size was right.  How could I go wrong?  Sadly, the stem is meant for a center hole--not the kind found of my tractor and most others on the market.  And forget removing one side from the rim (which I did to facilitate installation)--without the right setup you will never remount the tire.  I ended up taking it into a mower repair shop and had to fork out over $20 for a new tube and having the tire remounted.	-1
For $50 there ain't much in this kit. The bottles are the smallest ones and the "applicators" are nothing special.  Pros:  - Contains both Cleaner and Sealer - Comes with two each of the applicators and the microfiber polishing cloths - Klasse is a great product  Cons:  Not much value for $50. You are better off buying the larger sizes of each of the bottles and getting the applicators separately.	-1
It didn't work like it was supposed to. I ended up using a screwdriver because that worked better than this did.	-1
little pricely, but worked well	-1
Be aware if you order it...I did and I got a 1/4" wide roll and sent it back. The Amazon sticker stuck on the outside of the clear plastic container said it was a 1/2" wide by 50" long roll and the manufacturer's description on the inside of the front read 1/4" wide by 50' long. It was indeed 1/4" wide.	-1
It looks great, but reflection is bad.  When exposed to water, it is breaking and sticks off. It could fit and stay if it is not exposed to water, snow , cold temperatures. Plus you cannot band to the side, it is plastic based.	-1
If it reflects they must be using a special light.  Yes I did peel the thin clear protective film off the face side.  Put it on one side of my 32 foot motorhome in a trim strip that has a black plastic insert.  The side without tape does not reflect just like the side with the tape.	-1
Low score because the saying "don't believe everything your told" is all to true.  I have a side trim strip on my 32 foot motorhome with a black inset in it.  With the desire of safety and design I felt this reflective idea while maintaining the black accenting would be good.  The reflection could be seen from the side and possibly even when vehicles are passing being visible in lane changing. NO the reflection is not at all like represented in the sales information I read.  Yes there is some reflection but on a 1 to 10 with 10 representing the best reflector you have ever seen these reflect only a (1). The tape adheres well and there is a film on the exposed service are that must be removed.  If you fail to remove the film there is NO reflection.	-1
I can't believe the price for this junk.  It's tape, it does stick, it's mildly reflective (about as reflective as you'd expect glossy black tape to be), but overall it's totally not worth the obscene price.  For reference, I used this on my black motorcycle, so I bought the black version.  Honestly, I think my black paint is just as reflective as the tape when light is flashed over it.  Yes I pulled the film off it it, yes it has a metallic finish, but it's just not what it's cracked up to be in the description and some other comments.	-1
Bought it to add to my Motorcycle for riding at night. I have found it only works at certain angles when the light hits it and then it is still iffy. Kinda bummed I thought it would be as reflective as the Police car graphics. Yes I did remove the protective clear coating that was on top of it. I have lined both sides of my bike with this tape and parked it in the road at night to test the reflectiveness and nothing really only on certain feet and angles. Better then nothing I guess.	-1
This product is WAY overpriced for what it does. Although it does in fact reflect light, it does not do it well at all.  It's a 3 part tape with a removable backing that allows it to be applied, and a removable covering that enhances the effect, if it can be called that. I used this as driveway reflectors on my solar lights stems, so I could see better on days when the sun does not charge the lights.  Coming in the driveway with my HALOGEN backup lights right on them they DO NOT REFLECT back to me. I found out that in order to see any reflection from this "Scotchcal" tape, the light source and your line of sight have to be parallel, or else you will just see shiny black tape. Might as well just use black electrical tape. It's about 1000% cheaper and looks identical. So long as your lights are higher or lower that your own line of sight, sadly this is a complete DUD.	-1
Poor Quality, but was inexpensive... never worked one time	-1
Poor quality...do not buy this	-1
Opened the box and began assembly. No bolts, no wheels, nothing. All that was inside was the handle assembly and brackets to load the paper rolls onto.  This is now a HUGE PAPERWEIGHT. Unfortunately I cannot return this as I ordered it last year and the return period has now expired.  I have ordered another one and This time I will open the box and double check to be certain every single part is included.	-1
The disappointment began when the box was opened. No instructions were included. Searched the Internet and found the manufactures sited and down loaded the instructions. The instructions are poorly written and you still will struggle to assemble. Start assembling and the paint job is poor, paint runs, and paint thin in areas. Start bolting the parts together and the bolt holes don't align unless you assemble the base upside down. Had to re-drill the parts in order to assemble them properly. When bolting the paper arms on noticed that half of them are crooked or bent. Throughout the process found washers and bolts missing. Now that this poorly painted, miss manufactured, bent, missing parts is assembled we go to mount a role of 20" paper on it. Guess what it' won't work. Back to the web site to see if we can find more information on the assembly since the instructions were poor. We down loaded the specification sheet for this model. Another great surprise it states that the unit only handles 18" paper not the 16"-22" paper as advertised. I wish I would have read the other reviews before purchasing. Avoid this product.	-1
Trash china tool, it is cast, the socket does not have the small index to lock onto ratchet it looks like it may brake off into engine if I use it. I work on firefighter trucks I cannot not gamble use with this crap tool, nor will I jeopardize my integrity.  The advertised picture looks allot better than the tool I received. Don't waste your time and money folks !	-1

This was messy to apply, and came apart after a couple of weeks.  The adhesive literally peeled off the original joint, it hadn't really bonded.  At least the mess came off the weatherstrip. I fixed it using crazy glue... that held.	-1
didfnt work	-1
Does not work!  Dont waist your money!	-1
this took a long time to arrive so I took some clear tubing I had and melted end with a torch, flattened end and used a small nail to pierce the tube at angles and worked great.  If this had arrived sooner I would have used it.  Ok did a 2nd car and tried this vs my home made tubing sprayer.  This thing kinked, would not bend and when it kinked caused the spray gun to blow product onto the side of the car.  glad I used plastic sheeting to cover the car and taped it to the car at lower edges.	-1
Not what I thought it was, description is vague at best, this is a clear/cloudy wax, it is not black and it is not similar to GM factory undercoating (which I had read it was)	-1

only works to remove factory strut cartridges. The fatter gabriels would not clear the inner tabs that allow extension to drive  pin socket. I had to rent the oem 27034 from autozone. It does not have tabs inside because there is a separate 3 pin and 4 pin sockets.. No flipping of pin socket w/oem 27034 .Very dissapointed w/OTC. this is going back.	-1
Could more accurately be called the Dent May Help Tool.  First off do not ignore the directions and try on a vehicle in the sun.  It just won't work.  I used the tool on several dents and never did get completely satisfactory results.  It did lessen and improve one simple round ding.  The tabs on which the liquid glue is applied seemed to adhere better the first few pulls so make your first pulls count.  I am not sure I would buy or recommend this product.  The concept seems sound but it failed to give me much satisfaction.	-1
This didn't pull one sent in my 2007 Impala. Save your money.	-1
Didn't work very well on my dent. Might been the location or my lack of experience with the problem but I wasn't terribly impressed.	-1
I bought this appox. 9 years ago initially, so far, I had to replace the tool twice(no serviceable parts).  Need appox. four hands to use on car.  Way over-priced, next time it breaks off to ebay it goes.  Way to much play in the dies to flare.	-1
The MasterCool tool gets 5 stars all day, shipping was a disaster..  The plastic case was broken in 2 places because of the way it was packaged.. It was thrown in a box (significantly bigger than the tool case) and sent... There were no peanuts, bubble wrap, news paper etc..  This tool is heavy and I'm sure it got a real pounding during shipping... It was sent from another company and not Amazon...  Didn't want to deal with the headache of sending it back and decided to keep it...	-1
This unit worked good for the first few flares then it was all downhill from there. I am restoring an old cadillac so i had to do at least 24+ flares on multiple sizes of stainless tubing on this vehicle alone. ALL the dies I used for this car are worn out ALREADY.They started chipping immediately. Junk AFTER 1 CAR!!!. Mastercool told me they don't warranty wear even when i told the girl it was one cars worth of flares. The holding dies are chipping where they grab the tube. They appear to be made out of pot metal. This in turn causes the tube to oval and so the flare nut can't slide up to the flare without a hammer!!! Also,the pump handle leaks fluid when under pressure. Almost all the flares LEAK. I have to buy more tubing. Mastercool says go after the seller and the seller says they don't do warranty. Put your money in an old fashioned manual tool. Thats what I'm back to.	-1
I own or have used almost every SAE 45 degree double lap inverted flaring tool (and ISO/DIN Bubble flare) on the planet so I can't take all the happy glorious testimonials any longer. I own the Kent- Moore version of this kit supplied to GM dealerships. For double flaring lines OFF the vehicle in a well lit area it is acceptable but on-the-vehicle flaring exposes serious design problems. The tube dies are NOT doweled, tapered or otherwise nested and captured & aligned adequately (foolproof) with this tool. The upset adapters & cone attachment to the ram end have a ridiculous amount of slop causing further alignment problems requiring another hand to keep aligned as the adapter/cone @ ram is guided into the tube end. No easy feat with gravity and brake fluid keeping everything slick. Too easy to break weak adapter pilot pin or actually miss tube with cone. The tube dies are long presumably for better grip but that often renders this tool USELESS when the repair area is SHORT leading into a bend. I have other flaring sets with shorter grip length that have equal or superior grip...never slip. The hydraulic ram unit otherwise is very good & powerful. However, when I have a critical one-bite-at-the-apple situation I call on my Snap-On/Bluepoint TF-1000 (I believe similar is sold as Lock Technology 3000B multi flaring gun) a bit heavy but a rock solid design using heat treated tool steel and importantly can get at short lengths & has SELF-ALIGNING thrust bearing- screw type tube guided ram...you can sort of "feel" the flare as it's forming. Mastercool needs to apply better tool design principles here before they hit your wallet this hard. This kit is NOT the cat's ass just yet...I'd wait for an upgrade. JP	-1
This arrived mostly dry already. Too dry to use.	-1
I tried to fix my shoes, It's very sticky, and hold at first, but dosen't hold long, and need to re-fix again.	-1
I like the previous comments. Unfortunately i did not experience the same good results, i used this product to glue a new trunk weather seal on my BMW E28, the seal forms a water channel, due to car design the seal is always under a lot of stress, this glue lacks the strength to keep the weather seal in place and therefore allowing water to come in contact with metal in the trunk of the car, consequently corroding the trunk. I finally took the time to remove most of the 3m material and replace it with plain common silicone glue purchased at the local auto parts store. The silicone glue did a far more superior job.	-1
Not a god product at all. I purchased for use on sheet metal. Arc will not burn through it. The 3M stuff is much better. I had to end up removing the primer from the weld surface after my piece was tacked on because it would not burn through.	-1
I've used 2 of these for about 2 months now -- probably 6-8 times in both traditional (soap and water) and rinseless applications. They work OK -- not as good as the wool mitts I've had for years or even the microfiber chenille mitts. In my opinion, they're now handy to have around for extremely dirty or disposable applications. With the price I paid, I knew they'd be average or worse, but I don't recommend them unless you'll only use them half a dozen times a year or for that one super-dirty-throw-it-away-afterwards job. Mine are shedding and going in the bottom of my "mitt" drawer.	-1
Just doesn't cut it. Doesn't hold enough water. Should have gotten Chemical Guys wash mitt.	-1
absolute garbage - do not waste your time and money - bought 4 for a school car wash and they fell apart on first use after making a mess in the buckets and on the cars - this manufacturer/brand should be banned from Amazon!	-1
Won't last long as I wash my car once to twice a week. Pay for what you get.	-1
Not heavy duty.	-1
It's a decent quality washing mitt, which does it's job, and is pretty well suited to it's $4.49 price at overpriced B&M stores such as Sears and Kmart. It's also sold under the name Clean Rite at some retailers. If on a budget, it's the mitt for you, but expect lint on the car for a while, until washed in a washing machine a few times (must not put in washer with any fabric that can cause lint, ie ones that won't leave a trace in the lint trap, or washed with any harsh chemicals like bleach/ammonia, with fabric softeners, or many detergents, just a very mild soap) Even when washed properly, it will wear out much quicker than other microfiber mitts in it's price class. This mitt was selling for less than half the price, and within about a day, for reasons that escape me, shot up to over $5.60, especially with the other similar mitts from this company, consistently bordering around $3.00, a price that actually suits these. If you'd rather spend a couple bucks extra for quality, or actually want a mitt that will last, go with the Chemical Guys MIC493 chenille mitt that ranks #1 in sales on Amazon.	-1
i have used it a few times and it dise not do what is said of the product the interior doea not come clean it does take up a little dust but thats it ,it did not clean all the dust like it said it would	-1
If your interior is already cleaned, don't use it.  It will leave lots of lint on your dash.  I have a one week new car and i wanted to keep my interior dust free.  So I got this from Amazon with other car care products.  I had applied some ArmorAll on my dash and leather seats to keep it protected.  After  a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash.  So I wanted to start using this duster.  After opening it brand new out of the blister pack, I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel.  I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should "Pick UP" dust instead of leaving "LINT"?  Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again....	-1
thinking these were like the californa dusters that have the wax that traps the dust we order this product.  really don't waste your time or money,  these have nothing that helps trap the dust.  all they did was smear the dust around.	-1
I have tried everything from shaking, to holding it out my car window while shakinging, and I cannot get this thing to stop shedding. It leaves behind more dust than it picks up. Terrible. Unfortunately, it would probably cost as much to ship back as it cost. Spend the extra on a California Duster.	-1
Get  a California Duster instead.  This duster just moves around the dust and leaves lint everywhere. A waste of money...	-1
Feel apart in a day. Waste of money.	-1
Stiff and literally flat. Good for flat surfaces in the engine compartment. Think about it.	-1
Bad product - hard bristles, and they come off very easily	-1
Really crappy product for detailing. The bristles are way to hard and shouldn't be used on anything except maybe scrubbing valve covers.	-1
This brush is awful as the bristles are too hard to use around the emblems of my vehicle and could scratch the surface.	-1
bristles are falling out and are a lot stiffer than expected. the bristals were cut in a way they have a small hook on them and hang on any kind of  cloth.	-1
nothing more than the Microfiber cloths bought in bulk at Costco but a larger cloth.	-1
I too purchased these (4 packs) back in June of 17, and have the same lint issue. Tried washing them and just made it worse. Heaven forbid you wipe your windows with them.  You'll have to spend some serious time working to get all the fibers off. Using them for garage / shop towels instead and just tossing them.  I'm a huge Meguiars fan, and this is the only product I could say anything bad about.	-1
Somewhere along the way in early reviews, I read that the H60XA was made in the US. I was suprised when I received my gage and read the packaging which clearly says " Made in China". I will not longer be buying any gages from them since they have decided to go to China for production.  Shame on them for selling out to Chinese made gages.	-1
Junk	-1
Cleans well and long size, however, gave off too much lint/loose particles. Normally I like Meguiars products, not this one....	-1
This stuff is great for my bike but when i got it one of the bottles lids wasn't tighten so it leaked threw the box. Ruined my xmas present	-1
Bought this along with Mothers Clay. Mothers clay is significantly better than this. The consistency of the material and outcome etc. I like other Meguiars products alot and have many of them but this one is not quite upto the expectations. Sorry to Meguiars if this is rather unfair to rate based on comparison but thats how it is.	-1
UPSET!! I tried it for the first time on my mustang and it scratched the finder. I made sure to add plenty of detailer before rubbing with the clay bar, but it ended up scratching the paint.	-1
clay is small and will require extra effort to clean the vehicle with this clay kit. overall works great with a lot of effort	-1
Worst towels I have bought!	-1
Weird product and not much info. U  I used the metal polish on my Street Triple frame and engine, the product turned them white from the sparkling matte black. Used WD-40 to remove it. However, this worked fantastically on my chrome wheels and BARE metal engine on my XS650.  The leather cleaner doesn't seem to work, if at all. However, did an okay job on my leather couches and seat on the XS650.  EZ cleaner and plastic one worked great on the Street Triple. Left water spots on the XS.  Will not use the wax since both bikes are matte one is matte orange the other is flat black.  2/5 on the Street Triple, 3/5 on XS650. I feel like this is more for shiny Harley's or sportsbikes.	-1
A couple of products were opened on delivery. Wheel cleaner leaks all over. I would just buy what you want individually	-1
I wish this bar would be a little bigger, it is not easy to work with	-1
This stuff just falls apart. The seal started to deteriorate after a month.	-1
Be aware, This did not come in the box but rather in a plastic bag. The bag did not include the setting blocks as indicated in the product description	-1
Box was open when arrived and did not include the setting blocks. I had to fabricate these from material I had to purchase at the local hardware store	-1
This product works well.make sure you get new and not product that probably failed QC and ended up on Amazon or an auction site.	-1
Generic brand, NOT 3M. Sold in single 15' rolls, NOT "Pack of 6." Waste of time and money!!!!!!!	-1
Useless on windows. Leave a huge amount of sticky lint behind.	-1
Not 3M and came in a large plastic bag, allowing the roll to fold onto itself. The sealant was stuck to itself and the plastic packaging, causing most of the roll to be completely unusable. Luckily I didn't need much, but the false advertising is pretty staggering.	-1
Installed the window, 2 months later, the "sticky" thing felt apart and the window started geting looser and looser till i had to take it out... came out by hand. Almost like it never cured. very rare from a 3m product !!! but true story.	-1
kilfast hp-52 pop rivet  tool is a piece of junk  cannot get rivet rods to replase	-1
I had one of these for about 10 years it never failed to perform. Then sold it on craigslist and never looked back and my rivet projects are so much easier and more professional now. With what? ANYTHING but a "right angle" riveter which this is a classic example of. I now have air/hydraulic riveters that importer sells in everyones town for about $55 for the 3/16 capacity and $80 for the 1/4 (the 3/16 is powerful enough unless you really do use 1/4" rivets) and these units sell for the same on amazon and are plentiful. If I don't have air I use an old ritchie 702 pistol grip style gun I scored used at the swap meet but similar versions available on amazon from westward and others for $45 and up. I may try the "bolt cutter" style sold here from astro pneumatic soon. Now whats my beef with the right angle design which dominates the industry... well Ive set thousands of rivets- probably tens of thousands even and prefer stainless steel. The right angle design forces you to use one hand to squeeze the handles and the other to hold the head to the work so the rivet sets flush. This works for anyone but a little girl on aluminum rivets. However on steel or stainless rivets the handles open so wide and require such force that only a gorilla could efficiently squeeze with 1 hand and hold it flush with the other. Oh I have done it but with all my might. You shouldnt have to wear yourself out with a tool and your work WILL show poor results and loose rivets are not acceptable. With the pistol grip fype particularly air hydraiulic about 80% of your strength and effort can be concentrated on keeping the rivet flush or even holding two pieces of work together with the other hand. So if you are a gorilla or like to expend extra effort this marson is as good as any but is the same bad tool. You can do better!	-1
It broke the first time I tried to use it. I thought the other bad reviews were just user error, but since trying it I now know it is poor quality. I am returning it for a refund.	-1
DOES NOT WORK WITH LED BULBS. After an hour of contortion to install this in my FZJ80 it worked fine with the standard filament bulbs however  when I switched over to the LED bulbs (the reason I bought it) they just stay on and do not cycle off. Flasher makes a buzzing noise when this happens. I reinstalled 1 standard filament bulb and it went back to flashing. This flasher has too high of a resistance threshold to be used with all led bulbs. Waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY.	-1
The item shown is not the item you received. It was not made in the USA. It was made in Taiwan. It did not work! It necessitated a trip to my local auto zone where I picked up the actual part for about 12 bucks. Do not buy this.	-1
The one I received is NOT marked the same as the product photo, does not say LED like the photo, and does not work with LEDs. Apparently there are two different Novita EP35 and this Sold By Amazon one UPC 020637 30235 is the non-LED version.	-1
Did not fix hyperflash due to LED turn signals on my 2002 Toyota Tacoma. 2 stars cause it still blinks. I am going to try resistors.	-1
Did not work as described.	-1
Returned, did not work in my car as advertized.	-1
Worked exactly as OEM, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I bought this to correct hyperflashing on my LED turn signals. Did not correct the problem. Flasher had a continuous buzzing sound and not flashing the lights when all (4) LED bulbs were installed. When only two LED lights and two OEM tungsten lights were installed it would hyper flash. Exactly like the OEM flasher. Returned.	-1
This is NOT the Tridon EP35 Flasher as listed! I ordered it thinking it would be (I needed the specific model for my LED conversion), and ended up receiving the "Novita EP35" which is not for LED use. I ordered a replacement and received the SAME one.	-1
Didn't fit my supra	-1
This was sold as fitting my car, it doesn't.  I went so far as to check the part number on other auto parts web sites since Amazon's information is wrong in some instances.  Funny thing is they list a correct flasher unit for my application but there was nothing about it being LED turn signal lamp compatible the reason I went with this one.	-1
Hooked it up as per the direction got nothing but a buzzing sound; went with the EF32RL from CEC Industries	-1
I give a two star because I have bought 4 led turning signals and I install 2 in the back and it works good after I install all for check and I notice the all for turning signals where on whenever I switch right or left so is not for led turning signals I does work but you might have to install more than 4	-1
Did not work, lights would come on solid	-1
Will not work with Led lights without ballast resisters. So this not a no load flasher unlike what description says. Amazon refunded money. Great customer service.	-1
As a general rule, I read at least several reviews to get a better sense of the product from the buyers side, instead of the sellers side. I researched this product thoroughly before purchasing it and I read all the reviews.  The first Tridon EL12 Flasher I received had loose parts rattling around inside. I contacted the seller, returned it and was sent another.  I installed it but it still didn't work. Partly because I was given wrong information on the placement of two in-line diodes which were installed in the circuit. That was corrected. Nevertheless, the 2nd Tridon Flasher was deemed defective and I bought a new one. Now this one (the THIRD TRIDON FLASHER!) doesn't work as it should. It is designed for low load applications. When I have ONLY LEDs in all the turn signal sockets, it doesn't flash!  I must put one incandescent on each side for it to have enough load to flash.  This is for a motorcycle application. I am modding a Honda Rebel CMX250 to have LED turn signals.  This flasher is supposed to replace the resistance-based flasher.  That would allow very low load LEDs to operate in the light sockets. This flasher did not perform as expected. I still have to have 2 incandescent lights in my rear turn signals to get the unit to flash properly. I am not happy with that.  I have gone to great lengths to research, a lot of forum discussion and even hired a mechanic to help me with this. It should have worked. I also called superbrightleds.com and spoke to a tech. He told me this is the correct flasher. The turnsignal circuit is a very simple circuit. There really isn't much to it. The bike i am working on has limited electrical power and i wanted to mod with other electrical devices.  This may work out for you. Just be aware that you may also spend a lot of time trying to figure why it won't work!	-1
I replaced the 22 year old factory coil in my 1990 geo with this piece of crap hoping for some kind of slight improvement in either gas mileage or performance. What i got was the opposite. Once the truck was fully warmed up it would missfire once or twice while turning slowly onto a steep hill and pressing on the gas. I immediately knew it was the coil as this is the first time ive been driving with the coil and it never happened before. Once i got home i verified the problem by stepping on the gas quickly and holding it down from an idle while in neutral and parked, the engine stumbled for a good 5 seconds like it wants to die and then finally starts to catch up with itself and the rpms go up. It should defenetly not be a heat issue with the coil becuase there is plenty of ventilation all around the coil in the engine compartment of this truck (tracker). Put the 22 year old factory denso "Made in japan" coil back in and problem is gone. DO NOT LET THE PRETTY COLORS AND STICKERS OF THIS THING IN YOUR ENGINE BAY FOOL YOU. I was very dissapointed when i found out this coil is made in china and not U.S.A. I figured accel is a quality enough company to manufacture their products in the U.S or at least Japan but i guess not.	-1
This coil was installed together with the Accel points eliminator kit and together with Iridum plugs resulted in excellent performance .....for exactly 300 miles.  Then the car started missing and finally died completely during a hot summer day on the highway.  A look under the hood found that the coil had leaked all its oil from the top.  A tow home cost 129 dollars. Now have an MSD on order.	-1
This thing is aweful. It worked no better than the original when I put it on in late december. And failed in February. Don't waste your money go to your local auto store and get one specifically for your vehicle. This is garbage. Motorcraft d500 is a far superior coil. And can be used on anything this can.	-1
Worked for two days not worth the time sending back	-1
I thought it was really great at first. Then I took off on a trip cross country. Periodically it would simple give up on North and stay between East and South . Moving only within that range. Then I would attempt resetting. This never worked unless I turn it off and try again an hour later. Then surprise everything is hunk dory again.  Also I am confused on how the "black Ice" alert is suppose to function. When the temperature sunk to 45 degrees any temperature fluctuation below that would trigger the buzzer and or light. It has been my experience that freezing point is 32 degrees F.	-1
Never used it. Was meant to be part of overhead console.....BROKE before it ever worked.	-1
Would not calculate.  When I did as the instructions said, it went into cal mode and was supposed to go back in 20 sec.  Never did go back, even when I turned it off and back on, it was still in cal mode.	-1
Is very bed not WORKING	-1
If Amazon continues to market such scams, I will have to cancel my account.  Directions were full of misspellings which indicates poor quality and lack of attention to details.  No reputable firm markets a sloppy presentation.  Compass Unit itself would not complete calibration process. Once in the cal. mode it never returned to op. mode.  Magnetic technology is not functional.  Poor engineering on top of poor quality and presentation.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS JUNK.	-1
compass is crap, thermometer is not even close.  You can calibrate it, and it will loose it the next time you power it up.  This is a p.o.s.	-1
The ability to tilt the display is very limited and will not tilt forward at all (so an instrument panel or dash that tilts down toward the windshield won't work. The compass would not calibrate after multiple tries in different locations. Had to returen the unit	-1
not real happy received fan in my installation I am unable to use plug so i have to cut wires to install. Did not check before I installed and it don't work on any speed. Since wires are cut now im unable to return. Do not buy this fan.	-1
Not enough air for the noise level.  Rattles.  Sounds like the bearings are going after a week.  Draws 1.65A at 12V.	-1
Well made but loud.	-1
Uses a cheap resistor to slow the fan speed.  Open it up and re-crimp and connect all the wire connections, and wrap the critical connections in electrical tape (silicone), before using.  Otherwise it is a fire hazard.  Unfortunately, these are the only metal fans left on the market.  If you can't find used, get one of these and fix it before it burns your camper down.	-1
The whole head fell off the second time I tried to swivel it into position.	-1
Looks fine but the loudest most annoying fan motor noise I have ever owned.  You literally want to use it but you may as well fire up the blender and have conversation if anywhere near it.	-1
It's making too much noise but the worst thing is that  the 2nd day l installed the tilt base broke.	-1
Looks good, but...  The 12v plug was flimsy and broke when disconnecting (the 1st use!).  I put a different plug on and the fan worked for about 30 minutes on low speed before overheating.  When it overheats, the fan speed drops or stops, and then starts. Very annoying when trying to sleep!	-1
Decent construction and air flow but really loud. If its running I can't hear my generator. Worst of all the metal blades "ring" adding another layer to the noise.	-1
Do not purchase, burnt up in less than 10 hours of use!	-1
Fan seemed built well, very retro which was nice in my old rv. Blew fuses every time I turned it on. First time was ok, every subsequent time the 15 amp fuse blew instantly.	-1
I did not have a great result from this product. I used ti to reattach my rearview mirror in my 1999 BMW M3. I followed the directions exactly. The rearview mirror stayed up for about 6 months then fell off again. I will be switching to a different brand of glue, maybe Permatex in the future.	-1
Mirror fell off.	-1
I've had several replacement windshields installed and each time the installer's adhesive has failed when the windshield got hot. Each time I did a DIY to replace the mirror bracket. I bought the Loctite to re-install the mirror and followed the instructions very carefully, but in each instance, when the windshield got hot (triple digit air temperature, but the glass and car were likely much hotter), the adhesive failed and the mirror fell off. I finally decided I had nothing to lose by trying something different, and as I already had JB Weld in my shop, I mixed up one drop of JB Weld (that's right, it only took one drop), and after cleaning the glass and metal tab very carefully, I re-installed the mirror using JB Weld. Voila'! Even on days when the glass was exposed to 110 degree (air) temperatures, the JB Weld held. Yes, JB Weld might be more expensive to buy because it is a larger size, but it is actually much cheaper/ounce and it has many, many uses. Even if the JB Weld only works 3-4 years, that is far better than the single-season that the Loctite worked for me.	-1
Fell off literally 2 mins after installing the mirror.	-1
In 3 months, the mirror came off again!	-1
Didn't work.  Ended up having to get my mechanic to reinstall it.  The kit he used cost $14. Does not work on a heavy mirror.	-1
Mirror fell off the next day. Not recommended.	-1
I followed all the given directions, truck was sitting after not being driven for several hours so it was a normal temp of around 75 degrees in my garage, cleaned the window, applied it as instructed, let it cure over a day, and the first time I went to adjust it, it just ripped right off my windshield.  I tried again but used the Permatex brand and it worked fine, I'm able to adjust it, and its still stuck on my windshield after several months and a couple adjustments.  Can't recommend this; I'd go with the Permatex if I had to do it again.	-1
The glue turned "gooey" again.  It was applied 100% as directed.  How do I get a refund?	-1
Did not work u have little time to do it perfrct once that window expires it's useless!! SOO!!! I tried everything! Except double sided tape i noticed gorrilla tape had some and a nee extra strong one claiming to hold 30lbs. It worked! It took 2 minutes and my mirror is fixed after hours of other glue prodcuts this simple tape worked. Now i finally used goo off to get all the old glue and duct tape off my window! I am happy it worked i should of tried it right away and am angry no one else suggested this!! Now.. we will see how it holds up on hot summer days but now in 70ddg in sunlighr all day it us fine. I should of started with when my mirror broke off it took glass with it making it all much harder. If tgis happens to u the first thing u must do is get alp the glass off the mirror button.	-1
Very poor quality, no recommended.	-1
Out dated, it did not work at all. Bought 3m brand from local store that was not out dated. Put on the same as loctite one and this one is still holding.	-1
It arrived broken.  The glass vial had smashed and the applicator tip dried out.  Useless.	-1
The glue was all dried up. Had to go buy another one at the store.	-1
I've done this repair with other products several times and it works.  This did not.  Mirror fell off after 10 min	-1
I have a 84 El Camino that I needed to replace mirror . The reviews I read all said go with Loctite products. I follow directions exactly ,I even let it dry over 24 hours. The minute I touched the mirror it fell off !! So I bought a product VersaChem follow those directions let it dry 24 hours and it worked great...So not sure if I did something wrong with loctite but it didn't work for me	-1
Junk	-1
I'm usually very good at these things, followed instructions perfectly in warm weather, and I even prepped the metal piece by sanding/cleaning. Disbonded from the window.	-1
Read all directions perfectly,  cleaned glass thoroughly  and it came off the next day.  Dealer sold me glue kit that held now.	-1
Held fine for about 2 months, by I live in Florida where it can get warm and this adhesive "melted off".  Bought 3M product and so far since good.	-1
followed there instructions completely,did not work,I would not use this product again.	-1
Cleaned glass with acetone, cleaned metal button also. Was careful not to touch any part that was to be glued. Applied the activator and let sit for 5 minutes as directions said. Applied a drop or two of the glue, held it in place for a minute and then taped it in place all night long (10 hours). Went to see how strong it was and it popped off. I'm not sure what else to try, did everything as the directions said.	-1
Followe instructions and the mirror fell off 2 days later	-1
Worthless... Followed the instruction to the letter. The rear view mirror worked great: For exactly 5-days. Then I found it on the front passenger seat. You only get a single, one-time application, so I had to get new adhesive. Instead, I used a 2-part epoxy. A much better choice, and plenty leftover for other projects.	-1
I ordered the button kit as well as the adhesive so I was starting with all new stuff. I followed the directions exactly. The button stuck to the window and I let it rest over night before mounting the mirror. It mounted, but when I moved it to adjust the angle, it came off in my hand.  One thing I remember is that the primer/activator liquid wasn't a dark color as in the picture, it appeared clear to me. When I applied it to the glass, I could see it, but when I applied it to the button, it seemed to instantly disappear.  I purchased the Permatex Extreme from a local auto parts store and that did the trick. Similar setup, but it worked.	-1
Mirror fell off first time it was touched... and yes, instructions were followed verbatim.  Definitely expected more from Loctite.	-1
poor Item I let it dry for a week put mirror on 5 min it fall off	-1
First, background. I have used different Loctite products for the past 15 years very frequently. They more or less do what they say they do. But this does not. I have tried it a few dozen times. It does not matter how you clean/degrease the windshield and the mirror mounting pad (I have used rubbing alcohol, industrial cleaning ethanol, even MAF sensor cleaner), it does not matter how you prime it (hot/cold, wait time, brush, wipe or no-streak cloth) and it sure does not matter how much you use (a small drop in the center, thin layer across, generous dab etc). The end result is adhesion that lasts from half an hour to the first time you try to adjust the mirror after letting the truck wait for it for a week. I am looking into something else.	-1
I used the product as instructed and left it a lot longer than it said, but the mirror fell off!!!	-1
Refill canisters are too large and do not fit in this dispenser.  Soap oozes out all over the place.	-1
Did not full field my expectancy	-1
I was hopping to make my hand clean up easier, but after pumping like a mad man for several minutes nothing comes out. Should be easier to use.	-1
For reference, I am using the proper GOJO container which even references this item as the dispenser to buy. I went ahead and put this thing on the wall only to realize that the container would not fit inside of it. There were no obstructions on the rim, it just had not been cut properly at the factory. Came back to check the reviews in case anyone else had the same problem and looks like its just me. Wasn't worth the trouble returning after I already had it hung, so I took a dremel and grinded the outer circle enough so the GOJO container would fit.  If you buy this, ensure that you check if the soap container fits on the dispenser before hanging it and you will need your own fasteners as they are not included.  My mistake for buying an overpriced soap dispenser...	-1
Is this product is supposed to make life easier by making a mundane task quicker and more efficient?  If so,  it has failed miserably.  This thing never worked right.  Once primed, it will dispense a only a few dollops.  It then will lose its prime ...again!  This endless frustration is not worth dealing with.  I found it easier to scoop the stuff right from the container than constantly re-priming this poorly designed product.  Looking at some of the reviews, I see that I am not the only one cursed with this thing.  Its not inexpensive either.  What a waste!	-1
I bought this dispenser and the appropriate container of GOJO for use in my woodworking shop. Got around to installing it today. No matter what I did (and yes, I read the instructions), it would not work. It is a very simple devise, that uses gravity and a simple pump to help it dispense the GOJO. At the center there is a small white plastic insert (you can see it in the photo) and in there is a small diaphragm that aids in pumping out the cleaner. No matter how I tried to "prime" the pump, or what I did, it never even started to work. Charging over $18 for a couple of pieces of plastic and a spring, you'd think the darn thing would work easily. Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return policy. I'll just be using the GOJO by opening the lid on the jar and scooping some out.	-1
Be careful with this product! It doesn't fit as advertised! And wrong coloring!	-1
Bushings crack when installing. Buy GM, everything I buy that is made by Doorman falls apart, my last Doorman oil cooler lines lasted 7 months. I have been through 5 sets of oil cooler lines for my 2 S10 trucks in the last 8 years made by Doorman. Even the original lines from the dealer are now made by Doorman. They start leaking when it gets below 0 degrees. For the hinges, my mechanic uses "Mr. Gasket 11 Shifter Bushing and Clip Kit" stainless steel sleeves customized with number 8 bolts that last forever.	-1
Bushing fragile	-1
Picture was misleading order because i thought the locking clip was like the factory round one but instead got the dreaded square one	-1
This is the kit I started with. One of the bushings broke while I was pressing it in with a special tool, so I bought the Redhound kit for half as much. The auto parts store only had two kits in stock, and a bushing kit that had 16 bushings, each one a different size. To blazes with buying 14 extra bushing that do not fit anything I own, so I went with the Red Hound kit, and will NEVER buy Dorman unless there is not alternative. I returned one Dorman kit, and used Red Hound kits top and bottom. Use a 5/16" bolt with a Belden washer & nut and two large flat washers to pull the bushings in. Be sure to put the FLAT WASHERS ON THE BUSHING FLANGES. The Belden washer may break off the shoulder flange on the bushing. Use a 9/16, 14mm, or 15mm open end wrench to finish pulling the bushing all the way into the hole.	-1
Top bushing was too large and did not fit my 1995 GMC Jimmy.  I had to use what was left of my old one, lucky the bottom one does most of the work.	-1
works ok, bushings are definitely not brass and need to be	-1
purchased for a 2001 chevy s-10 the pin and bushings are fine but you do not get the retaining ring you see in the picture you get the square ones you see in some of the other pictures which are brittle garbage	-1
Cheap material the little rings would break in not time. I would not recommend these bushing kit.	-1
Not very strong/sturdy- go with GM parts.	-1
The pins seem to be of OK quality but the bushing material is far too soft, within a week the uppermost bushing of the two hinge pin assemblies on my S10 drivers door split and collapsed.  The pin was then wearing directly on the door hinge but.  This negated the fix to the door, entirely and completely.  I should have purchased the bushings from my local GM Stealership or NAPA.  Dorman quality can be iffy, these are less than iffy.  The quality of these "replacement" parts is "replacement junk".  I suggest you pass on these repair kits, if possible.	-1
This product scammed me with mis leading language. My fault. Be careful and insure you read quantities and specifics. The product worked but I had to order another one to complete the job. Two day wait.	-1
the pack inside of the box was open and the clips weren't in there im very disappionted about this product	-1
worked ok but would recomend spend extra few dollars and get bolt on ones	-1
Tried to install these and would not work. Broke two brass bushing trying to install so went to a local parts store and purchase the bolt on type. The bolt on type is the only way to go and anyone change these in 20 minutes or less.	-1
I ordered these to replace my worn pins on my truck.  I'm CDO about my truck and I noticed a bit of play in the factory stock hinge on the driver door.  As it turns out these are made with pretty generous clearances and my door now has more play than it did before installing these.  My next step is to try McMaster-Car in hope they will have a tighter fitting bushing in the correct size for my door hinge.  I gave them two stars because they do an adequate job of holding the door onto the truck.  FYI: CDO is similar to OCD except the letters are in the correct order.  Erik	-1
Per my other review of the pads, this control tower does not fit on the pads as easily as it should. I had to shave off about an eighth of an inch of each tower to make it fit on the pad and even then it's a tight fit. In the manual provided it said to tighten the pads after installing the tower, but it can't be done. There is no room or space for the wrench to reach the pad once the tower is installed.	-1
installed on e90 bmw 3 series, it was easy, painless and looks like a factory option. it is really seamless integration with bmw mounting system,  AFTER BEING INSTALLED FOR ABOUT A YEAR I REMOVED THEM TO DETAIL ENTIRE CAR AND NOTICED MASSIVE DENTS IN ROOF. not happy about this at all, I may have tightened them too much, but i strongly doubt that, and if it is that easy to over tighten I think there should be some sort of warning about it.  dont know what to do about the roof dents.	-1
The fairing itself looks good on my 2004 Tacoma. However, I was really disappointed with the pieces mine came with to assemble it. It comes with plastic specialty fasteners that once pressed in will not come back out. The problem was that two out of the four fasteners they sent did not even fit in the pre-drilled holes where you connect the fairing to the brackets/mounts. So, I either A, had to drill the holes larger, or B had to go to the hardware store to buy more plastic fasteners and hoped they fit. So, I took a trip to the hardware store thinking that would be easiest, but quickly found out that none of the hardware stores around here had black plastic fasteners, just grey ones. So then I had to spray paint the grey fasteners black. Two evenings of visiting hardware stores, new fasteners and black plastidip later I finally had black fasteners ready to go and was able to mount the fairing to my roof rack. A pretty big PITA, and extra time and money for such a simple issue that should come done correct from the factory!	-1
I've owned the Yakima Q-Tower system for almost eight years.  I just transferred it to my third vehicle (same bars and Q-Tower, somewhat different clips needed for different vehicles).  The tower itself, and the foot, appears relatively aerodynamically efficient.  The lock housing -- not so much (the lock housing is the assembly that holds the clip and the lock and has the cam that locks down the unit to the car).  I also bought the optional fairing for two of my vehicles, but have never used it.  I liked the idea that the fairing would reduce wind noise and slightly increase fuel economy.  But I found that I'd have to remove the fairing to attach things to the bars -- and at least some of the things that I wanted to attach were incompatible with the fairing.  I don't even use it when I just have the bars up there because -- well -- I usually try to remove the whole mess when I'm not using it to even more surely decrease noise and increase gas mileage.  The round bars have been effective -- can't complain about them.  I presume that they are slightly more aerodynamically efficient than Thule's standard square bars, but can't prove it.  The bars definitely increase wind noise when they are installed -- I'm even more inclined than usual to keep my speed down with the bars up there -- to keep down noise and minimize fuel efficiency decrease.  If I were buying a system now, I think that I would look into one of the new Aero bars (i.e., with more of a wing-shaped cross-section).  Incidentally, the three vehicles I've used this on were: 2006 Scion xB (the old original boxy version), 2008 Toyota Prius, 2013 Toyota Prius.	-1
I put this on my Mercedes C300 and it did not help with the wind noise at all. It looks great but aside from that it made a higher pitched whistling then when I did not have it on. Definitely not worth the cost and did not meet my expectations at all. Yakima needs to fix the wind noise because it drives me crazy!	-1
$160 ?? Just buy a 10 foot 1" EMT conduit pipe at Home Depot for $6/each and get four rubber 1 1/8" chair leg tips for $2.50. Cut to size and add pipe insulation for padding. You just saved $145!	-1
Much of the plastic was pilled off the bars	-1
The Yakima rack system "howls" when the vehicle is going 40mph or faster....almost intolerable on the freeway.	-1
Light output is very good, nice beam pattern. However the plastic lens is fragile. I have had them installed for a year and have twice been taken out by highway pebbles. I am about to yank them out and look for something mOre solid.	-1
Contrary to Amazon's car fit tool, this product does not work with the 2007 Honda Civic hybrid.  The aerodynamic spoiler on the wipers doesn't allow for the wiper to rest against the windshield because it hits against the wiper arm bracket.	-1
I'm sure this product works fine, but it doesn't FIT the car! I used Amazon's part finder and it said it fits, and PIAA's web site also says it fits, but it does not! There are two major problems: 1. The wind deflector on the driver side wiper hits the wiper arm. The OEM wiper's wind deflector has a curve in it on the end that is near the base of the wiper arm to avoid hitting it. 2. The OEM blade has a "slot" that helps align it to the wiper arm (which has a receiver of sorts) - that also doesn't fit with the PIAA wiper.  Needless to say, I am returning the set of PIAA wipers I just bought. Very disappointed at both Amazon and PIAA.	-1

They're ok. Not what I was hoping for	-1
I can't discern any notable difference between this thing and my stock horn... seems to have been a waste of money.	-1
only lasted 8 months on my jeep.  and i had a heck of a time finding room for it, so unfortunately i think the easiest thing to do is order another one	-1
I bought these horns to replace the wimpy horn on a Subaru Legacy. The high tone unit never worked out of the box, DOA. The lower tone, the one I really wanted, worked for two days then stopped working. Big waste of time and money, especially considering the Wolo horn that I got to work no problem, procured from the local auto parts store for 1/3 the price of this pair! Prospective buyers beware!!!	-1
The receiver portion is sized a bit small to fit in a standard class III hitch.  It has some play, you will notice this if you are hooked on to anything.  The 1/16" vertical side supports do not support the vertical 2" riser very well, side to side.	-1
Do not buy these bulbs they are not what you think. I purchase a pair & they only lasted me 9 mouths. What a waste of money. PIAA my only be good for sponsorship. Try to buy hella before PIAA that's my opinion. Do not buy PIAA.	-1
worst bulb ive ever owned. the color is cool but they don't light up the road worth a dam! they burnt out within about 9months	-1
Dismally dim yellow. Returned.	-1
Not yellow at all, didn't last long either...	-1
The good: nice and bright and true amber/yellow color; the bad: i powered these on maybe 15-20 times tops and never for extened periords, ie road trip....so, if thats normal operating life, then alls good, but I expected longer life (1 bulb burnt out).	-1
OVERPRICED!!!  BULBS WERE SOLD NEW IN BOX BUT $70???  NO........	-1
Burned out much (much) faster than the original equipment bulb. Disappointed in this PIAA product.	-1
Horrible. I spent 75$ dollars on this and 3 months later one bulb explodes and burns 2 fuses on my car and leaves me stranded for 3 hours At night till i fixed it !!! I want another pair or a exchange! I have pictures of it. Please and when I do I'll change my review to a 5 star.	-1
Easy to install but they were not much brighter than my regular OEM Toyota Highlander 2016 fog lights.  The yellow lights looked  cool but I don't think they were very useful because they were dim and not too bright on my vehicle.  I have used PIAA before and they were great but these for some reason these ones didn't work for me.  Not bright enough.	-1
The look is nice, the light is nice, but the life span is VERY BAD. And the price is way too high (I bought them much cheaper but still expencive)	-1
Short bulb life in Mazda 3 fog lights Not sure why if it  is bulb or housing  It has happened twice  so not worth the cost for these premium bulbs	-1
Installed these the last week of April, now 2 weeks later one is burnt out. They were installed properly and the bulb glass was not touched. The set in my wife's car has lasted over 2 years. Hopefully Amazon will replace.	-1
I really liked these but they just didn't hold up. One failed after about 3 months and the other within a few weeks. Too bad. Very bright and clear as advertised. Just too pricey for short life. By comparison much cheaper Hella bulbs never gave me a problem and have been reinstalled. Still like the look of these much better.	-1
Do not waste your money on these bulbs.  I bought them purely for cosmetic reasons.  Yellow fogs look much more attractive at night and your car stands out from the rest.  Higher end Mercedes and Lexus came with yellow fogs from the factory to better cut through fog but they used a filter built into the lamp.  To mimic this effect the bulb has to have the color in the glass.  These bulbs cast an excellent deep yellow light but the first one burned out after only 4-5 months with little use.  I had maybe 10 hours on them at most.  I just took them out and replaced them with the clear made in Germany Silvania bulbs sold at a local parts store for $8 each.  I will never buy any Piaa products in the future.  Read other reviews and you will find many people with an experience like mine; I did not get a bulb that was abnormally bad.	-1
Not much to say.  I installed the bulbs and tried my lights one night, and one was burned out the next day.	-1
I bought this for the fogs on my 997 turbo and one side does not match the other and the color is very orange.  I've had good success with prior piaa yellow bulbs but this has been a big disappointment	-1
It has been about 5 years since I have used piaa bulbs and past experience was great. Now the quality sucks plain and simple. 1st bulb lasted 3 days the other one went out 2 weeks later. I never ran the plasma bulbs before had the coated lenses. Went to these cause the Hella yellow stars are not even close, but at least they have lasted and are now back in use(bought them last winter). Truthfully the piaa's are not as yellow as I thought they would be but do get less glare back in the snow and rain. Time for piaa's customer service and I to have a long talk. Once the rally bar is done for the Focus there will be Hella's mounted on there not piaa.	-1
Pure waste of money. Bulbs look amber, not yellow, and they are no brighter than the stock bulbs. Look for GP Thunder bulbs instead - twice as bright at 1/4 of the cost. I'll never touch another PIAA product again. Very poor product imho	-1
Its a really SMALL bottle, you will probably only get 5 - 6 washes at this most.  Not worth the $  You can purchase bigger bottles at your local walmart or retail store	-1
it might work good on newer aluminum on the older aluminum wheels on jeeps from the 1997  you better do a acid wash, I tried this before I did the acid wash and just a bunch of build up black black black never ending would not stop. did the acid wash all that polish surfaced  so it did no good on the older aluminum wheels. so that's my honest opinion cant shine a turd but you can rub all day if you want. more poop don't make a difference.	-1
didn't work at all.	-1
NOT FOR CHROME ! WTF?	-1
I like the product but the bottle is tiny for the price read it very carefully! You can do a lot better for the same or less money I think.	-1
Pain in the butt use.  I followed the instructions exactly and it took over 1/2 hour to finish one wheel.. Even then it wasn't what I expected.  Neighbor had some nanoskin which I then used on the same wheel and the other three.  Took about 10 minutes for all wheels and they are perfect.  I typically like Mother's products, but this one is not for me.	-1
This stuff doesn't cooperate when trying to polish Aluminum wheels. It will leave a horrible film on your rims that is very hard to remove!. I only used it once and was horrified by the results. It doesn't buff well, and doesn't make the rims look any better than before you started. Thiis product made my rims look awful, so I quickly tried to remove it, but it took forever to remove this product from my rims. It also has a very "chemical" smell that makes me believe it's not good for rims. I had to throw this product away! Avoid Avoid!	-1
Purchased this with the intent of shining up my factory polished Tahoe rims...directions say to rub on surface and wait for black residue....wiped on rim and no black residue, polish stayed whitish color. Can't polish rims, so useless to me. Would probably polish an aluminum bar up great, but for practical uses, not so much...	-1
Tried this product on the metal parts of  Kirby vacuum frame like I saw on a YouTube of someone using with great results; but did not even come close as demonstrated	-1
Yeah, this doesn't work very well.	-1
Didn't do jack for my wheels pal	-1
I use this stuff all the time and I love it. I usually purchase the smaller container at my local auto shop. I purchased this large container and it is not mixed well. Everything is separated. I have a large puddles of honey syrup stuff on the top od the product and today I decided to go down deeper and about one inch down it looks like Vanilla Ice cream with Caramel swirls. Maybe it is really old and sat on the shelf for years???	-1
Ended up buying different polish...	-1
I received a container already opened and used 1/4 part of it. Not worth my time to try to return. The product itself is very good though.	-1
when I received it and opened it spilled all over it was like milk. that is not how it is supposed to be	-1
Picture says this is great for all types of metals. But the package says, not for Car Wheels, Chrome, Coated Metals. So it's really only good for polishable metals. Wouldn't recommend this for people looking to use on Cars.	-1
I have used Mothers in the past and LOVE it. This? I hate it! It claims on the bottle that you can use it for colored molded plastics. I trusted it. It ruined my plastic trim! Left white spots all over it that I cannot remove with anything I have tried. Photo shows white spots (my apologies for the hand shadow) This will be going back to Amazon for a refund and I have lost some respect for the Mothers name.	-1
You get exactly what you paid for on this one.  Cheap price gives you cheap quality.  Hard to buff off even after a few seconds of applying it.  Glad it was just a few bucks.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Turtle-Wax-T-222R-Super-Hard-Shell-Paste-Wax-14-oz/dp/B00068OL1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Turtle Wax T-222R Super Hard Shell Paste Wax - 14 oz.</a>	-1
Good luck rubbing off this your car's paint. When it dries it turns into cement. Even washing car wouldn't help remove it's residue. I tossed mine in trash.	-1
Paste is very hard to remove after you've let it dry for the amount of time they say you need to let it dry. Not only is it very difficult to buff out, you will never remove all of it, no matter how hard you try. Good luck getting it off if you get it in small cracks	-1
Not impressed, after waxing and buffing for a few hours, the car looked great.  After about two months, no more water beading.  I will stick to spray wax if this is the alternative.	-1
I got mine filter in the mail in a good time frame but the glass was broken on the bottom and I thought it might hold but no Gas everywhere!!!	-1
I have worked as a mechanic for many years, These filters should be outlawed. Sometimes they don't leak but since you can get many different filters that will not leak ever you would be a fool to buy one of these. Read the other reviews.	-1
The filter itself looks GREAT. The only problem is the tips. Because it's "universal" it has the interchangeable tips that'll allow you to run the filter with different sized hoses. Great, right? WRONG. Because the tips screw in, they never fully seal. The best I got was a itsy bitsy drip, but this was only after I tighten them as much as possible with a pair of pliers.  Point of the story, buy yourself another filter.	-1
I was stupid enough to have purchased 2 of these and the second one recently failed completely on cyl 2&3. Lifespan was about a year for each on a less-than-daily driver. They had slow deaths, with frequent random soft or hard misfires, leading me to chase my butt around every other sensor on the car, thinking "no, it couldn't be my new MSD!". I have 8.5mm Superconductors with NGK copper plugs. Please, please never buy anything from these jerks ever again. Save yourself the time, money, and aggravation.	-1
Installed this ignition June 2012, coil 4 crapped out on me in August of 2013. All my mechanic friends have nothing but bad things to say about MSD and recommended buying a stock OEM ignition, with the same 1 year warranty, for half the price...or even two (just in case) for the price of one MSD! DON'T BUY THIS JUNK!!!!!!!	-1
This is a soft, fixable material.  But the bad news is that when used as an exhaust gasket it crumbles to nothing is less that an hour of running.  Do not use it for anything that gets above approximately 400 degrees.  There is another Mr. Gasket material on Amazon that does work at higher temperatures.	-1
Tried using as auto gasket material for holding liquids in - did NOT work as the oil penetrated it and leaked out	-1
Too wide for 99 toyota camry wires.	-1
I have 8 mm wire and these were too large.  I couldn't even use them.	-1
Shoulda known better. Whatevs, they'll work for now. I'll leave these on my 1930 Model A hot rod until I locate seperators made in the US by American hands....to match the car that's been on the road for 85 years.	-1
The kit did not include the cables as advertised. The cables were the only reason I chose this product. The packet had not been opened. If the cables were intended to be in the packet they had to have been left out at the manf.	-1
not durable at all, used it a few times worked well at first then started having problems with readings and the sound for continuity started fading away till no more, product has been in my tool case so it gets tossed around allot but not too often and now it does not work.  poor quality	-1
This review is for JUST the 250 gram can. This is stellar polish (10 stars!) but the big can it comes in is a disaster. I thought it would have a screw-on lid, but it is built like a paint can - you have to pry it open by working a screwdriver around and around, and it is darned tight! The lip ends up being all bent and deformed, and there is no way the can will remain airtight after a few uses. If air gets to the polish it will dry out and be useless. Because it is so costly, I transferred all the contents to five small prescription pill bottles. That way I can use one at a time and the full ones will hopefully remain fresh for many years. The 250 gr size either needs a new can design, with easy to close lid, or a really big squishy tube... In the meantime, I recommend that folks order the muli-packs of small tubes to avoid this hassle. JD Spokane WA	-1
I have been a long time user of Simichrome polish. This the first time I purchased the 8.82 oz tin. I opened the can to find it was only partially filled. I estimate almost half full. I noticed a rather large air pocket in the last tube of Simichrome Polish, which I wrote off as an isolated incident. However now after receiving this partially filled tub I decide to contact Buy-it-now via email. I received a prompt answer from Alex Hanson who said that I should "rest assured" that there is precisely 8.82 oz. Well at $2.95 per ounce I wanted to make sure and after emptying the tub and weighing the contents I found the total weight to be 6.5 oz! I write this so others can be aware and hope it helps others make informed decisions. The actual cavity is worse than the photo indicates.	-1
The Simichrome polish is a very good polish, however when my can arrived after opening the can up there was a scoop of polish taken right out of the middle of the can.  Not sold by volume but by weight.  I could not live with this so, I returned the polish for a full refund.	-1
I returned the floor mats the day after I received them, I was all excited about receiving them as we had a big rain storm coming and when I set the drivers mat in the car I was disappointed as it covered a smaller area then the factory carpet floor mats! Having beige colored carpet I was looking for floor mats that covered more of the area. Based on the picture it looked to like they had a outer lip for containing the water and dirt the lip was same hieght as the ridges.  After paying for the return postage I found out that I could have gotten the same floor mats for the same price at my locale Subaru dealer and would not of had to pay the return postage or 15% restocking fee.	-1
Mine was probably defective... I returned it	-1
This thing is garbage!  I'm sending it back.  It turns off automatically and waaaay before the battery is charged. It sat hooked up to my motorcycle battery for days, the green light was on and the battery could barely turn over the engine.  I thought maybe it was a bad battery so I tried it on my generator battery and got the same result.	-1
I can conclude that this charger doesn't charge an AGM battery up to the proper voltage before float charging. This was not designed, and should not be used with, AGM batteries, unless you want poor battery life and weak start ups followed by long ride times to fully charge the battery.  Older thoughts: I am pretty sure this doesn't work. It doesn't seem to keep my battery charged... when I leave it plugged into my motorcycle for a few weeks, it always weak starts, and I have to ride it around for at least 30 minutes to fully charge the battery, otherwise I will need to jump start it. Maybe it's a bad battery, but the battery is not even a year old.  Update: nope, it's the battery tender. I rode my motorcycle for an hour yesterday and now the bike fires right up a day later like nothing happened. It seems obvious that the tender maintains the battery at a very weak voltage, so you end up with a weak start. Sorry, but I don't always have time to ride around for an hour after removing my battery from the tender. I have already purchased an Oxford 3x Oximiser to replace this shoddy unit.	-1
Bought the Batt Tender 1.25 about 3 yrs ago. I keep it on my Snowmobile when not in use. I just took it off my Snowmobile and the Green light stays on all the time. Even when you just plug it into a electric socket it stays Green. I called Deltron and they wanted $26.00 to replace with shipping. This is the 3 rd one that does this. What gives with these Tenders?	-1
I purchased this product on 02-28-2015 and worked fine up until recently. Now when I hook it to my battery, both lights (red and green) come on steady when I plug it into a wall outlet. I've tried hooking it to another battery with the same results. I tried contacting Deltran with no luck. The Battery Tender Plus supposedly has a five year warranty which is good until 02-28-2020. I don't understand why I can't get any help with this problem.	-1
didnt work I have had these before and this one didn't work out of the box	-1
Installed charger per instructions and charged the battery for three days. The red light never changed, so I unplugged and removed charger and tested the battery. it was 5.5 volts! It was tested at 10.1 volts when starting the charge, so the charger DISCHARGED the battery! I tested the output on the charger and it was 5.5 volts. After reading the specs, it is supposed to charge at 14 volts. I am very disappointed and am returning this charger to Amazon and buying a different one.  Edited to add: I bought a Noco Genius G7200 and it has worked perfectly! It charged the battery in 10 hours and everything is good.	-1
First one was bad, returned to Amazon; second one same problem! First same as the last, hook it up. red light stays red for hours! Tried them both on 3 different good car batteries, same thing. After only 30 minutes hooked up, the unit gets too hot to touch -DANGEROUS, these things are a fire hazard! The maker use to be a great company with great products, but I guess they moved to China (PRC) and turned to garbage! WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHR BATTERY TENDER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Save your money people this is just junk i plug this thing in and it made a buzzing sound for 10 seconds then it just blew up  total waste of money.	-1
Don't waste your money. I bought this thing on 12/21/15 and it took a dumb after one year...	-1
Dung Pile Charger ruined my deep cycle batter from not go into the float mode. Went to use my battery and only had a 5 volt charge. Hooked it up to a regular charger and will no longer charge. The light stays red all the time unless you go out and unplug it then plug it back in.	-1
This stated it would fit my Polaris 800 but it is so way off.  Nothing about it fit. Measure first.	-1
Never goes into float on one battery and on 3 other batteries no matter what I do it's telling me the battery isn't connected properly.  Right, because there are so many ways to screw up hooking up positive and negative cables to a battery...  /sarcasm.    Garbage...  save yourself some money and frustration and look elsewhere!	-1
Stopped working,money down the drain.	-1
Not only do these things look stupid, they do very little to help your vision. But if you want to look like an idiot, these are a great buy.	-1
Burned out when plugged in!! Sending this back! Usually, Deltran products are quality, I have an on-board battery tender in my 1950 truck. For now, looking at this product and the fact that it burnt out before I could even connect a battery, I say cheap product and you might want to look at other ones. Does not feel well made at all and this would be a fire hazard even if it did work.	-1
I ordered these for my 1996 chevy silverado. The mirrors where just tall enough that with the wingnut tightened down, i could easily grab them and pull them off the front. The edges are too far apart to reliably grab the mirror. Also, the shims will destroy the front of your mirrors. On top of that, they were completely loose in the package, its a miracle they didn't break, and they were missing the long strips of padding as well as the instructions.	-1
They do the job but it is not a long term setup, they work fine for someone that does not do a lot of regular towing.	-1
Very generic, they did not fit well (1997 Yukon) and do not offer the same visibility as other towing mirrors i have used. I don't know that i would even go as far to say that they "are better than nothing." I got these for towing my camper and had they been Adjustable they would have worked, but they are not.	-1
Product works but the warranty is void if you make changes to the cord lengths. You must get permission from the manufacturer to change the cord length. I need to add 3 feet to the 12 vdc cord. Following the instructions in the warranty, I emailed a request to the manufacturer to extend the cord length. The request was refused. I could not change the cord length without voiding the warranty. This is not acceptable. If the user makes a clear, correct and simple change to the product to allow it to be used safely, the manufacturers should allow it.  The manufacturer should provide instructions to allow the change or provide a product with longer leads. Not all vehicles are located near power outlets and have ability to store the unprotected charger from the weather without making changes to cord length.	-1
cheap, cheesy, don't really stay on well and the mirror on the extension should be convex, not flat! What were they thinking? i could not recommend this product to anyone. I sent them rite back,put on two spot mirrors and the problem was solved. However...the paint on my stock mirrors will be forever scrached having tried this product.	-1
From a long time user of this battery tender DO NOT BUY. I recently replaced a Deltran Battery Tender that eventually failed. This new unit charged the battery and the green light was on indicating a charged battery. NOT . The car would not start, the battery voltage was 10.5V. This POS killed a 3 year old battery on my weekend cruiser. The mfg warranty is useless since a replacement battery far exceeds the cost of this tender.	-1
I have five Deltran Battery Tenders purchased in the early 1990's; once used solely for maintaining a charge on motorcycle batteries for eight vintage motorcycles.  I don't recommend the Battery Tender for fulltime connection to a motorcycle battery because the electrolyte will be depleted in a month or so.  A similar experience seems to prevail by other users of the Battery Tender.  As far as "tending" motorcycle batteries go, I'd rename the Battery Tender to Battery Destroyer.  I never used the Battery Tender for car batteries so I can't comment on larger car battery usage.  But I sure don't recommend connecting these to a motorcycle battery.  Otherwise, you can say bye-bye to your brand new motorcycle battery.  The heart of my Battery Tenders is a UC3906 battery charger controller.  The Unitrode/Texas Instruments data sheet of the UC3906 states:  "All of the voltage thresholds on the UC3906 are derived from the internal reference.  This reference has a temperature coefficient that tracks the temperature characteristic of the optimum-charge and hold levels for sealed lead-acid cells.  This further guarantees that proper charging occurs, even at temperature extremes."  Personally I find this amusing as an electronic engineer involved with the past design of complex military power electronics systems.  Now think about this comment directly quoted from the UC3906 data sheet statement.  First clue:  The "battery temperature compensating" UC3906 controller is located inside the Battery Tender enclosure and the remote battery being charged is located elsewhere, perhaps under the hood of a hot engine compartment.  Second clue:  The UC3906 controller operating temperature located inside the Battery Tender enclosure is not necessarily operating at the same temperature of the charged battery it's intended to compensate for temperature variations.  It's actually laughable to presume the remotely located UC3906 controller will compensate the charging voltage for a battery being charged several feet away.  Even if the environmental temperature of both the Battery Tender enclosure and the remotely charged battery is the same, the internal temperature of the Battery Tender enclosure is going to be higher than the external environmental temperature.  Hence, it's really a flawed design unless the UC3906 controller is mounted directly to the charged battery or placed in standby mode.  If the charging/standby voltage is critical as implied by the UC3906 data sheet, then an external temperature sensor should be attached to the battery.	-1
Worked for @ 2 years, their Service Department is a waste, they think I have a short in my Optima Battery that I bought at the same time, my Sears charger works fine, so no more Deltran Products for me	-1
I have a old car which I don't driver very often and find myself jump starting the car when I want to drive it. So I bought this item and it seemed to kill my battery. After 10 hours of use, the car wouldn't start at all.	-1
Pull it out of the box, stood it up, the wife came home hit it accidentally getting out of her car knocking it over and the wheels and axle fell off of the tank...Really? Cheap garbage it seems. I put it back on but not expecting it to last.	-1
Well the tank is okay but at less than a year the axle popped out of the plastic channel it sits in and will not stay put any longer. This contraption without wheels is not much use. The way it is built prevents me from doing a fix-it that I can figure out. Looks like the tank somehow developed a bit of curvature which forces the axle to pop out on one end. Not too well designed IMHO. Can not recommend anyone to buy this item.	-1
Wow, customer service from Deltran is *awful*.  I called them today for some help and I have never been treated so rudely.  This device does not properly detect the presence or lack thereof of a battery.  if you plug it into the wall before connecting it to the battery the "Storage" light comes on which means the tender believes the battery is fully charged and thus will not charge.  Even when you connect it to a low battery it doesn't properly detect the lower voltage and re-start charging.  This makes the product rather useless for it's intended purpose.  When I called Deltran's support number the woman who answered scathingly informed me that I was "tricking" the tender by unplugging it from the battery and plugging it back in too quickly.  When I explained that I wasn't doing that, that I was unplugging it from my truck, driving away and coming back later and plugging it back in she then changed her story.  Now she's saying that plugging it into the wall first is not allowed and that you had to make sure you connect it to the battery first and then plug it into the wall.  When I pointed out that this made using the product very inconvenient to mount it somewhere "out of the way" as I had done, she hung up on me.  I'll never buy another Deltran product again.	-1
Like others have posted, this has failed shortly after purchasing. I bought a five dollar charger from Harbor Freight to replace this piece of junk.	-1
I bought two of these for two different motorcycles... they both died within two years of purchase and the warranty is a joke.  "The Battery Tender Plus battery charger has a 10 year limited warranty, which is unprecedented among battery charger manufacturers."  What they don't make so clear is that I am supposed to pay two way shipping for each unit... back when I checked it was about $20 to RMA each unit and $25 to just buy a Battery Tender Jr... so that's what I did.  A few more years have gone by and so far those have been okay.  The warranty on this particular unit in my opinion is useless... look into that before you invest!  If I had invested in one of their high end models that cost me several hundred dollars then of course the $20 to have it repaired/replaced would have been the way to go... but in this case I think charging the customer 50% of the purchase price to warranty an item is just wrong.  That covers their cost to replace the unit, they aren't covering anything... they're just selling me a new unit at cost.	-1
Another failed battery tender and loss of battery.  I noted, just like others have that the light would go to "fully charged" shortly after plugging it into every battery I tested, including batteries that were significantly discharged.  A 1 year old battery left on the tender for 6 months showed the start of sulfation, which led me to investigate what the tender was actually doing.  No temperature compensation as far as I can see, too short (as in 2-3 minutes) absorption time at too high a voltage (14.9v), marginal voltage level once in float (13.3v).  Basically plugging in battery that is not 100% charged will lead to chronic low charge condition and early battery death.	-1
I have had two batteries die while being tended to by this device. Both were practically brand new. I have no idea why but the battery's demise was confirmed by the dealer in both cases. Seems to work for short periods but fails when left for months at a time.	-1
These used to be a great products.  It does extend battery life on boats and collector cars.  I've had two die in the past year.  When the first one failed, I downloaded the form to send it in for warranty replacement only to find out that it cost $20 to send it in for warranty.  I sent my $20 in, and they just sent me a new one.  Probably cost them $20 to make, so they just replace it.  Now, I just had another one die.  I don't think they are going to get another $20 from me.	-1
Upon arrival I hooked it up to my new deep cycle battery that had been cycled a few times. The battery was near fully charged-12.5 volts according to my meter so I thought this would be a good test for the float function. The charger started out in full out charge mode and after 8 hours it never went to float mode. The tender was hot as well as my battery so I disconnected it. I ran a couple of interior lights on my camper for an hour to take the surface charge off and checked the voltage again. It was almost 13 volts - overcharged in my book. If I had blindly trusted the battery tender to automatically keep my battery maintained when I wasn't using it , it would have just cooked all of the water out and ultimately killed the battery or worst yet - started a fire in my camper. I ended up buying the B&D VEC1089 - I love it - it cycled perfectly and the digital readout tells you exactly how many amps it's charging at. I don't know if I would trust just leaving it on all of the time though. I think I'll just get into the habit of charging the battery once a month. As much as I would like the convenience of automatic maintenance there's no substitute for just taking care of things the right way. My only concern I have with the B&D (as with any product now days) is how long will it last ? Time will tell !!	-1
I usually don't write reviews but this is a different story. I've used this item 2 times and sat to the side for months in garage. Will not even turn on.this item is trash.. Shop around first before you buy.	-1
I have had the same problem as others. Will not go into float mode and boils all the water from my motorcycle battery. Have tried it on two batteries and ruined both of them. DO NOT BUY THIS!! Someone told me "Battery minder" is a better charger. I may give it a try.	-1
Does not charge fast enough for my needs, so I returned it.	-1
STOP WORKING AFTER 1ST USE!	-1
I purchased this Battery Tender to keep the battery in my summer car charged up in the off season.  Unfortunately this battery tender caused my battery to leak acid all over the trunk of my car causing corrosion and requiring an expensive repair.  I purchased this unit specifically because it's NOT supposed to overcharge a car battery.  What a mistake.  Don't buy this product - it doesn't work as advertised.  I reached out to the manufacturer via their website twice but they never responded to me.  Faulty product + no customer service = fail.	-1
The battery charger works as designed ,it keep the batteries charged. I will no longer have a early battery failure. I will recommend	-1
This maintainer worked great--for about three months. Then it died deader than a door nail. The so-called "10 year guarantee" wasn't worth much. I would have had to pay $12 to return it to the company, and another $12 to ship it back to me, because I didn't have the receipt (but there's a date code on the unit.) and then, if I send it to them there was no guarantee they would repair or replace it. ("Only if we determine it's a factory defect.") That's more than half of what I paid for it in the first place.	-1
.........yeah right.  I used this charger very little in our garage. noticed one morning that the units lights were off. Found the GFCI had tripped. Reset it to realize the tender starts having smoke come out of it and eventually breaker tripped again. So figuring it comes with 10 years warranty I checked out their website to find out the following:  The costs of transporting products to Deltran for warranty service is the responsibility of the purchaser, after 90 days with proof of purchase.  I could handle that, but on top of it I have to pay $12.95 for a Warranty Evaluation, Shipping & Handling (WESH) Fees. So all told I'll be out another $15-20 for a product that cost me less than $50.  Essentially you get a 90 day warranty, anything after that you pay for shipping and warranty evaluation.	-1
Add me to the list of failures...after 11 months. I do not know why I ignored over 30 one star reviews. I thought with all of the positives, they must be flukes. Well mine just fried, nasty burnt electronics smell, no lights, no output. It did not hurt the car it was attached to and I discovered it very soon after failure. It is not worth the hassle indicated by others to file a warranty claim. I ordered an Xtreme hoping for longer life and good performance. Anybody reading this review, beware! The failure rate on these Deltrans is too high.	-1
Bought this because of all the reviews, but it did not work for me.  My Harley uses an AGM battery, and found out after the purchase that this charger cannot charge an AGM battery.  For a simple battery maintainer, this product is big and heavy.  I expected more.	-1
I got this to keep my stored batteries from dying for my classic vehicles. It worked great for about 2 months, then it stopped going into "maintainer" mode and fried all of my batteries. Some of these reviews say this was a great company before they started getting built in China, but for my 60 bux it was just a waste of money and batteries.  I too donated it to Waste Management like another reviewer said.	-1
The tender works marginally well and after a few years the grounding prong pulled loose of the plug. I cut the unit's plug off and replaced it. This unit keeps the battery charged but I've noticed my voltmeter reads just over 13 volts every morning so it seems to me that this unit is keeping the battery barely charged instead of fully charged. I recently bought a Solar ProLogix 12 amp battery charger that seems much better built and keeps the battery more fully charged. If the ProLogix literature is to be believed, it is a much more sophisticated unit than the battery tender while the cost is just a few bucks more.	-1
I have a collector car that I only drive to shows or a very occasional joy ride. I've tried a few other brands and was disappointed. This seems to keep the battery charged (without over-charging) and works flawlessly. I'm going to order another one for my ATV!  Just a follow-up. I purchased this in 2011, in 2013 and it failed (just died... no lights, no voltage). I paid to sent it back to the manufacturer and received a replacement (which appeared "reconditioned) but worked, until January of 2015 (well that's when I noticed) it was also dead. BTW, the other one I purchased for my ATV also died after just over 2 years.  I'll try yet another brand and hope for better results.	-1
I own several vehicles and motorcycles and I had one of the pre china battery tenders and it lasted for several years. it did so well I bought 3 more of the battery tender pluses at one time at Christmas 2010.  one worked for about 9 months and then would not go into the float mode. It killed the battery from overcharging. hooked up the next on a different battery and it worked about 2 weeks before doing the same thing(not going into float mode).  the 3rd one lasted less than a week........... each has a 10 year warranty so I phoned deltran and spoke to their "tech". he cannot understand my problem........ tried on different batteries. plugged into outlet first blah ,blah ,blah. I paid over $100.00 for 3 of these Chinese junk chargers.  I can send them back and they will check at my cost if nothing is found wrong I would be charged a service fee and return shipping. poor customer service ,bad quality. for what these cost they should last.  Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy these battery tender chargers........  Update: 1-15-2014 buy an xtreme charger......I have 3 of the red xtreme charger, see my review ........	-1
This is the 4th Battery Tender I have purchased in the last 12 years.  The warranty period is 10 years, but if the product fails earlier you must send it back the manufacturer for $8 postage and then pay a $13 shipping/handling fee, basically 1/2 of the price of a new one.  I've had to do this 3 times in the past (they fail after about 3-5 years).  I bought this unit since I knew it would take forever for them to replace my last defective unit.  I wish someone else made a more dependable unit.  One more thing: The unit has a red and green LED light.  Depending on various conditions, the lights can be on, or blink or a combination thereof.  The manual details the state of the charging based on these lights but fails to indicate what is happening when both lights are on without blinking.  I called them and they said the unit had failed.  It would have been nice to include this alternative light pattern in their manual.  9/16/11 Update: I have just changed my rating from 3 stars to 1 for the following reason:  Deltran, in their infinite wisdom returns the replacement unit via FedEx Ground, but with signature required!!!  It is of no use to call FedEx and ask them to leave by the door, and today I found out that even leaving a signed note by the door still will not allow FedEx to leave at the door (or else today it was not my regular FedEx guy who routinely leaves everything at my door).  So, if you are away for a few days and miss the delivery(s) then you must pick up the package at the nearest FedEx office, which for me is an hour RT.  All this for a $40 item!!!  As an aside I keep buying this unit since it does keep the Optima battery on my rarely used sports car in good shape, still after 9 years, AND the Battery Tender is wired to my battery with the plug just sticking out from the hood (so I don't have to re-install a wiring harness form another manufacturer).  But if I was starting over I would consider buying a unit ftom another manufacturer.  I agree fully with another reviewer that it is a bit scarely to know the charger will fail without notice and by the time you ascertain this it could be too late.	-1
Had my battery tender plus for just over 2 years and it worked great for those 2 years maintaining the battery in an antique car. Recently I put it on the battery on my daily driver and the charge light didn't come on. Testing on several other batteries seems its lost its status lights and all its regulation and just puts out a constant 15 volts now cooking whatever battery I hook it up to. Their tech support was rude and unknowledgeable. Of course their warranty is a joke since it will cost 50% of its value just to make use of their warranty. I considered buying another but with so many other choices now on the market I can't rationalize the battery tenders high price. I replaced it with a Vector for the same price which has twice the features.	-1
first, it was very difficult (for me) to find a ground point that would let this product attempt to work.  and when I did, it did not "charge" the battery...	-1
Why haven't they corrected the problem with the large size Schrader valve you can't get thru the valve body ! I ordered this set hoping by now they would have corrected this issue with all the post about user's who couldn't complete the job to repair their Ac system , but they haven't ! Maybe they just don't care Only smaller sizes work	-1
Does not work on the high side fore my 2008 Expedition.  Removed the low side just fine.  The diameter of the vavle assembly is not large enough for the high side schrader valve to fit though.  Guess I'll have to have the system full drained, then replace the valve, and then recharge.	-1
