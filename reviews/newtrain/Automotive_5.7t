The kit is basically exactly as pictured. It will work great on most ball joints, I was even able to get it to work on a moog problem solver ball joint with very little clearance. I've also used it to separate tie rod ends and it works sweet. I'm not sure what alloy metal OTC uses but these seem pretty damn strong so far and have not broke. You can never have enough pullers and presses in your tool kit. Please rate this review if it was helpful.	1
works  good	1
Great tool, just have for any garage	1
This worked perfect for my 2011 Ford Escape.  I will never to a coolant flush the old way again.	1
A Must Have For Mechanics. Some Cars you just can't get all the air out of engine no matter what you do. But with this tool, No Problem.	1
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. USED IT ON A 2002 MERCURY MOUNTAINEER COOLING SYSTEM, NO MORE AIR BUBBLES IN SYSTEM AND SUV RUNS LIKE NEW AGAIN. NO MORE OVERHEATING . THANK YOU!	1
This pressure tester did the job just as advertised. You need to keep the pump plunger oiled and even then it's still a little stiff but it holds pressure well and seens to be pretty sturdy.	1
I purchased this for use at home as I am an avid DIY'er doing most of my car repairs. The Stant Cooling System and Pressure Cap tester provides accurate testing of the cooling system. Note that you also have to purchase the correct specific radiator neck and cap adapters to fit the vehicle(s) you are working on. This  may make it a bit price prohibitive for the casual user.	1
tight fit and no leak when conducting pressure testing!  maybe some lubrication on the pump will make pumping motion more smooth.	1
This unit has saved me a lot of sanity. After using it to find a hole in the radiator, I used it to confirm there was no leaks on the new one I installed giving me piece of mind. Definitely recommend for anyone who only has a basic mechanic background.	1
Very little can be said as it was all there and works, so it is what was described good deal for the price.	1
I bought this since they didn't have the right adapter for my car so I bought this.  Very important tool when rebuilding a engine	1
After doing some research this was the best one out there.  I was not dissapointed.  Worked great and is of very good quality that will last a long time.  Very happy with this!	1
worked great for my VW	1
Love this simple device, good price as well	1
If you want to check your alignment on your tires, assuming you don't have four-wheel steering, then this is the tool for you.  The only reason why I say four wheel steering, is because people think they have to check their rear for alignment--not true unless they have the aforementioned.  In any event, you would utilize this tool on you brake "rotor" to determine whether or not you're positive or negative.	1
This tool arrived on time (only 2 days - thank you Amazon Prime). The instructions are easy to read and the tool looks like its really going to help me align my car once its lowered.	1
I have only used the tie rod end remover so far, but it worked perfectly and without straining to remove the original tie rod ends from a 2001 Subaru.  Like many other reviewers, I wish these tools were made in the US, but they seem like they were made to high quality standards.	1
These tools are high quality, heavy and durable. I haven't tested them to destruction, but I've pulled very difficult joints using a lot of pressure. Nothing has harmed them at all. The bodies look forged and the threads on the screws are the proper Acme type square threads. I can't find anything bad to say about this set. You can pull ball joints, tie rods, pitman arms on all makes of car and light truck without damaging the boots.  These are big enough for most cars and light trucks. The different pullers let you remove almost any front end joint on almost any car or light truck. Don't bother buying one ball joint puller, get this set and you'll be using most of them. I need at least 3 different pullers to work on Mercedes. This is a universal set, and I have yet to find a make/model that it won't fit.	1
I used to be the guy at that went back and forth to Autozone borrowing their pullers. Not anymore! These are amazing and the case is fantastic. I never realized how often I would use these until I had them. I've used them to pull two pitman arms (so easy), pop tie rods to change the boots, pull my transfer case yoke out to replace it and even a couple project in the house. It's one of those purchases that you feel like kicking yourself for not doing 10 years ago.  The pullers themselves are fantastic quality. Don't make the mistake and buy the one puller you need now for half the price of all these!	1
I bought this to simply pop the lower ball joint on my 2006 Land Rover LR3 with 70K miles. I couldn't use the venerable pickle fork, so I had to breakdown and buy a front end set. This kit paid for itself in this one job alone. The dealer wanted over $700 for this job; It cost me $200 for parts and $94 for this kit. I used the longest puller for my job and it easily popped off the ball joint with just a couple of cranks with a normal length 1/2 drive breaker bar. The puller didn't even flinch. No warps or bends in the claws.  I suspect this kit will serve me for life since I won't be abusing it with a commercial rate of use. I do work on cars more than the average backyard mechanic and I am confident you don't need to drop $400 more on a commercial grade name brand set.	1
This is another great OTC product! I purchased this kit to disassemble front end components without the use of a big hammer...lol... The tools worked great for their intended purpose. Well made and easy to use. Another great addition to my tool cabinet!	1
Tool recieved and fuction as described. More for weekend mechanics, would not get for everyday use. But for use on occasion, good.	1
The SG Tool Aid Strut Alignment Level is made of good quality and gives me a quick and easy look at the wheel alignment.	1
This thing works great!  I did the entire car with ease!  Picked up a 1-1/8 impact socket to go with it.	1
I change out the wheel studs on our race car a few times a season for safety. This tool does a great job al installing the studs straight and even. It is a time saver. Great tool!	1
No doubt the easiest way to replace damaged or broken wheel studs. This product will save you lots of time and money.	1
The pullers had everything I needed to separate my Jeeps ball joints and tie rod ends.  It is nice to have the right tools!	1
I bought this kit to give me the parts to do tie rods and center link on an old MB diesel.  The kit was perfect and the tools were decent.  My main issue and reason for not given five stars is that this is not US-made.  Global economy or whatever, when I'm looking for quality tools, I'm not looking for products from overseas sold at top prices.  Sure, these are better than Harbor Freight, but I doubt the third world labor to make this was much higher than the HF part.  But that is a rant to have another day, and I can point you towards a better kit for now.  So this is a great tool set for the DIY mechanic.. But I do hope that OTC brings manufacture to the USA.	1
I used this for my 2003 X5 4.4 to remove control arms and tie rod. One of the units from the set will fit and do the job. No need to buy the expensive BMW tool! Yes it does get some time to fit the tool over BMW spindle, but for the halve of the price of one toll I'll do it again.	1
This is a great tool for the money.  They are the exact same tools they sell individually but for a lot less than you can pick them up for.  I have bought a lot of OTC stuff and have been happy with its quality every time.  Wish they were at least still made in canada but thats out of my control.  would rather support the canadians with my money than the chinese.	1
what else is there to say? it is a great tester mine just broke down after many years of solid use. have to own tool if you're a mechanic.	1
I bought this about three years ago on Amazon to replace a Snap-on pressure tester from the mid-80s.  I'm a diesel mechanic and this pressure tester gets used about 3-4 times a week all year long.  It's well built and sturdy and the case has survived a lot of abuse (most of these blow-molded plastic cases break their clasps very early on).  This tester has survived hundreds of uses and pump still feels strong.  My only complaint is that the gauge needle will jump when you set the unit down and it will also move when you pick it back up.  I've learned to set it down, establish a visual reference point to avoid parallax reading errors and then not pick up the unit until I've taken my final reading.  Handling the unit while taking reading can cause erroneous readings due to the needle movement.  I've seen this same problem with most cooling system pressure tester gauges.  I've been planing on switching my gauge to liquid filled gauge at some point to see if that fixes this issue.  In any event, this Stant pressure tester is well worth the money and would definitely buy another one if this one ever needs replacing.	1
as an automotive tech anything that saves me time is invaluable, with these new cars its important to get all the air out of the cooling systems, on  some cars that's almost impossible to do without a tool like this. this one has held up well and i have never had to bleed a system again with it. i have owned one other tool that was supposed to vacuum out the cooling system but right out of the box it didn't work. i have owned this tool for almost two years	1
Great product, a must have in our heavy duty bus shop.  Use it for leak detections on gas and diesel engines. Makes refilling the system trouble free	1
A+	1
The airlift is awesome, after learning how to use it. It's best if you have a 5gal bucket of coolant to draw from, at work we use this to fill tractor trucks and it will draw 10 gallons with one "charge" of 25 to 27 lbs of vac. Down side is no positive paid pressure feature.	1
Device works well. Must buy adapters to make work for specific applications (Honda civic). Adapters are overpriced but they are needed and fit well.	1
Well constructed tester, the tester fits the cooling system on both of my Dodges (Viper and Durango) without any adapter, and the additionally included adapter allows it to test the pressure cap - in 30 seconds I was able to track down a couple of problems, one was an OEM pressure cap that was opening at 10 psi instead of the indicated and required 17 psi, and pressurizing the system allowed me to find two problems that I had been having problems finding any other way.  Although I've been working on my own vehicles for 30 years, I had never had cooling system problems that required any special tools, but this allowed me to find problems I didn't know were happening (such as the pressure cap opening too soon).	1
This Stant cooling system tester is well-made (metal not plastic!!) and the instructions that come with it are very helpful.	1
I have owned the Snap-On version of this item in the past and there is no point in paying over twice as much when this item does the same job. I just used this a few weeks ago and it found the leak in 15 seconds. It's a fairly straightforward item and it does what it is supposed to do. Again I see no reason to pay over $100 for a Snap-On/Matco/Mac brand when this one does the job just great. It's well-made and works perfectly.	1
One of the lowest priced cooling system pressure testers available, yet very well made of good substantial materials.  The pump body is all metal - no cheap plastic.  Most of what you are paying for in the more expensive kits is all the adapters.  If you can use a standard "A" cap, then a simple model like this that doesn't come with a lot of adapters is all you need.  It works very well and is very easy to use.  You can also order from Stant any adapters you need.  Stant is a very well known name in cooling system components, and the quality of this tool shows why.	1
Excellent for people who have a use for this tool. Ideal for the backyard mechanic tool kit.	1
The tester does it's job as advertised.  The tester is not very useful unless you have the standard radiator cap and radiator or you have the adapters needed.  The adapters can be expensive.  A complete set of adapters will cost more than the tester, $300 or more.  Check the STANT web site for the adapter you need and make sure you are willing to buy the adapters you will need before you purchase the tester.	1
Works very well. Fast deleivery. I am completey satisfied with the way the purchase management and the tool itsself.	1
works great.	1
WORKS GOOD	1
beyyer price then Myers Tire supply.	1
Original equipment so the quality is great, price was better than though local suppliers. Quick delivery.	1

Item arrived but late but to be fair it was the holidays. I used it on a Ford F350 and it worked great and less than 1/2 the time of my one off the tool truck. I had no air in coolant after this it was great. I am an ASE Certified mechanic. I don't usually use the universal types with the cone but had no issue with vacuuming and refilling plus adapter fit great on my application. I do wish they sold a guard or protector for the gauge though just in case of accident.  Update: Tool is working great and found that if you can find or make adapter it makes a great tool for removing air from power steering systems as well. I would not try to refill with it in that instance though.	1
This thing works GREAT. One of my cars has a really fidgety cooling system with a lot of little parts, so after replacing just about everything from radiator to thermostat I wanted to be sure none of the bazillion O-rings had leaks and when I refilled no air would be trapped inside. My compressor sucked the system down to 25" almost immediately and held perfectly. After a few minutes, I switched fittings, put the strainer into a bucket of coolant and refilled the entire system in just a few seconds. I needed just a minor top off (maybe a cup?) and it was done. I could not be more satisfied. Definitely not one of those tools a DIYer uses every day, but if you use it just a couple times in your life it will have paid for itself in saved time & frustration.	1
How in the world could this kit come with everything and yet missing the 1/4" NPT fitting on the vacuum side. I had to get that male fitting from Harbor Freight to screw onto the brass adaptor. That is inexcusable from the $130 kit and yet require you to get another 1/4" NPT fitting from another hardware supply to make it work.  Nothing more frustrating for any user to have to compromise in the middle of a job and have to make a run to get a part in order to finish the job.	-1
Product works as described. Took me a little while to get the rad neck fully tight but I finally found the sweet and was able to check pressure and refill using the other hose provided. I do strong recommend buying the airline nipple ahead of time; bought mine as Lowes. Also recommend not using one of those cheap air compressor as it will not hold enough air to fully get the job done before having to refill itself. Other than that, it worked well.	1
Fantastic Product and easy to use. Comes with clear and precise instructions.	1
Perfect as this is what my mechanic owns and uses on SVT Cobra Mustang to bleed out air bubbles	1
Absolutely a great purchase. Very easy to use, I'm glad I finnaly bought one.	1
Love this tool!	1
you may not need this tool often but when you do it pays for itself, well made, works flawless, so glad to add to my workshop	1
So yes this is an absolute time saver when doing cooling system work. You can fill and bleed the cooling system in under 2 minutes. So that's what I love about this. What I hate about it, is that you have to switch hoses after you put the vacuum on the system, to then, fill the system with coolant. Maybe that sounds fine to you. BUT, before I bought this I have been borrowing co-workers' Vac Fill tools similar to this. And they all had single hose setups. All you had to do was turn a valve. So I don't like that about this one.  Other than the slight inconvenience, this is an absolute great tool. Make sure you have a big bucket to go with this. I got a 5 gal bucket from Home Depot for $3. Because, if you run out of coolant before the system is full, you just defeated the purpose of using the tool. So get a big bucket and keep several gallons in it.  You will also need an air fitting because this set does not come with one.  Highly recommended time saver for flat rate techs!	1
Clumsy to be swapping out the hoses all the time and it's always more of a mess than the fancier versions that have both hoses connected at the same time. It's still better than filling with a funnel just not by as much as I would like.	1
Glad I purchased this unit...just wish I had done it sooner.	1
As someone who does all my own work on all my vehicles, I regret not buying this earlier.  This makes it so you can do a single flush on a cooling system in under 20 minutes all on your own with basic tools, I highly recommend this product to anyone.	1
Without this Airlift, it would be impossible to fill the 2004 Cayenne. There might be a breather plug somewhere, but it would be difficult to get to anyway. This is much easier. This Airlift uses the Venturi effect to create the vacuum inside the cooling system with 90 lbs or more of air compressor.	1
If you are looking at this then buy it. I just got mine yesterday and I have never refilled a cooling system so fast, easy and cleanly. I was a professional mechanic until 2004, now I just work on mine and my friends cars. No air bubble, no dinking around trying to raise the front of the car or trying to bleed the system. It literally took 2 minutes to refill a 3.0L ford after doing lower hoses and I had no problems with the dreaded trapped air pocket.	1
The best one made. Yes the gauge is a little cheap but they all are. Main body constructed of brass instead of plastic like the rest. Plus it doesn't have just the cone like the others. So can be used a lot more  easily on most cooling systems. If you are an  automotive tech. This is the one you want.	1
This is amazing!! If don't wanna do it the old school way and fill, heat up, cool, and watch it burp then this is the tool for you. You have about 300% on time. I can fill up and do a pressure test in about 5 mins	1
Professional grade tool. Worth every penny.	1
Not sure how I went so long with out this tool?! Now that I have it I don't know that I could go back to doing coolant flushes without! Works well, simple to use, takes the headaches and frustrations out of bleeding cooling systems.  A little bit pricey but its the price you pay for quality tools! Its also nice to know if theres any cooling system leaks before refilling...and this will pretty easily let you know if a leak is present under normal conditions/pressures!	1
AWESOME tool!!  Very fast way to properly refill just about any car with coolant	1
Another awesome tool to have when dealing with a difficult cooling system to bleed. Sometimes regular style bleeding leaves air in hard to get places in your cooling system like the heater core. This tool is perfect for a flawless bleed and also doubles as a way to check for leaks if its does not hold vacuum. Highly recommend!!	1
This product is a must have for refilling coolant systems	1
saves time	1
Really nice kit for vacuuming the coolant system, only takes a few minutes to vacuum and refill, should have bought this years ago!	1
You gotta have one of these if you change out your coolant your self.  This is about the best tool that I have purchased in years.  I have a diesel truck and needed to change out the coolant and check the system for leaks.  This device, as long as you have a decent air compressor or shop air, will pull a vacuum of over 25 inches on your system, and then you can hold it there to see if you loose vacuum.  If you do, you have a leak.  Then change out the hose adapter and put it in your new coolant and or distilled water, and pull the new stuff back in your engine and radiator using the vacuum you just pulled.  I know this saved me well over 2 hours in draining, filling 4 times.  For you do it your selfers, this is a must have to change out your coolant.	1
I have not used it, so i can't give it a negative review but based on other reviews i would expect this to work just fine without any problems	1
Work just like it post to .	1
This is absolutely the best tool to flush and fill coolant fluids! On my vehicle, 2016 Mercedes AMG GT-S, this is the only way to drain and fill. Extremely high quality and works exactly as advertised. No surprises, just works!	1
This things is just great. My brother bought this for me for helping him flush and fill his coolant on his Mustang. His model Mustang is known for having airlock issues if not filled and burped correctly, and even still it can be time consuming and still result in trapped air.  Enter the UView tool. The quality of all the components can be seen as soon as you open the case. All of the fittings are dense and have solid weight to them. The various rubber adapters should fit almost anything you'd need to hook the tool to. The gauge is simple to understand and easy to read.  I have a 30 gallon 6CFM compressor that made short work of the tool. Within seconds of hooking up my air supply and opening the valve the vacuum was climbing fast!! I watched as the radiator hoses started collapsing around the 5 seconds mark. We reached 26 on the vacuum gauge in roughly 45 seconds, closed the valve and waited. The system held great. You swap to the suction tool via a quick disconnect, put it into the bottom of your new coolant, open the valve and just be amazed. The fluid moves fast so do be aware of that. Definitely start with at least a gallon. You can shut the valve to move to another jug as necessary.  As advertised once the vacuum is gone and fluid is no longer being pulled into the system you are full and ready to go. It's as simple as that.  I had the pleasure of using this tool twice over two days because as part of the post flush process we changed his thermostat. Unfortunately I didn't test it before install and it was bad, but the process of filling was so easy because of this tool it didn't bother me at all.  I'm normally not someone who likes to jump into purchasing specialty tools, especially at this price, but I would not hesitate to tell someone if they even need to do a fill on a coolant system ONCE this tool is worth every penny of time and issues you may avoid. I will be much more likely to do more frequent servicing on my other vehicles just because of how easy this made the process.  NOTE: You do need to have a male thread (1/4" MNPT) air fitting (NOT INCLUDED). I do think for the price of the kit one should have been supplied, but it's definitely not a big enough deal to remove a star.	1
Works good! My only recommendation is to have your new coolant in a 5-gallon bucket so yu can fill in one shot.	1
Works Very good and fast . Way better than the old Air lift I had for years	1
This kit makes changing your Jeeps ball joints a breeze.  I used this adapter kit along with the OTC press, and it worked perfectly. This kit is crazy expensive for what you get, but if your labor time is money, it's worth it. It comes with a single paper sheet instructions, and the kit's parts are etched with part numbers to make using the correct adapter quick and simple. And the adapters all fit into the OTC press's carrying case.  Which is a nice touch.	1
I used it to service a 98 Jeep Cherokee XJ with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OTC-7249-Ball-Joint-U-Joint-and-Brake-Anchor-Pin-Service-Kit/dp/B0002SRGXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OTC 7249 Ball Joint, U-Joint and Brake Anchor Pin Service Kit</a>&nbsp;and it worked pretty well. The parts are made in China but are of good quality and look like being made of hardened steel.  The two cups for removing the ball joint are perfect. The two for the installation not so much but still okay. The angle of the lowest one isn't perfect for that Dana 30 axle but close enough for not having any problem because of that during installation. The inner diameter of the longest cup is about one mm too large for my taste. Theres too much play with the new original Spicer ball joints I used and the cup, on one side, comes at the edge of the knuckle of the ball joint. Because the angle of the other cup isn't perfect, it is difficult to center this one around the ball joint. Anyway and thanks the good quality steel, everything run fine.	1
I hoped this would work on my vehicle (in title), but it wouldn't.  Technically, what wouldn't work is pushing out the old factory lower ball joint.  The cups provided are not big enough to go around the bottom of the ball joint (on the "receiving side") of the push out.  The smallest part (bottom of picture) would work to press out the old ball joint (but again, none of the other cups are big enough to go around the bottom of the ball joint).  The small cup part (at bottom right of picture), plus the biggest part with the square notch (upper left of picture) would work for pressing in a new Moog K7411.  Ultimately, I returned this without using, because the ASTRO 7897 kit I purchased had IDENTICAL pieces in it to these, plus an additional cup that I made work for the pushing out of the old one, so I didn't use this kit.  Product appears to be of very good quality, and if I were a professional mechanic, I would probably go for the OTC 7894 over the Astro 7897 as I'm guessing the OTC will last longer over the years.  Again, the ASTRO 7897 has all four of these in it, and they are identical in shape, size, thickness.	1
Bought a Harbor Freight ball joint press  with their adapters. Did one side before I started breaking stuff, (tools). Ordered this adapter set with new press. Got the next side done in a half hour.	1
I bought the Amazon Warehouse Deal thinking it would be a good deal.  Not so much.  The one I received was obviously well used.  Worse it was incomplete.  The remover was missing from the box.  This is likely going back to Amazon.	-1
A Must For changing Jepp And Dodge Ball Joints.	1
Did the job on a Jeep Wrangler TJ (1997-2006) Dana 30	1
Exactly what i needed.. Used it for a F250 6.4 diesel that i changed the radiator myself. Had to buy a small pancake compressor 150psi it think.  All the Airlift directions say it needs to have is 90psi.  It worked Great.  I have used the Airlift tool multiple times on my truck before i changed my radiator to see if i could find the leak (it was hidden behind the intercooler) and i used it to refill the system after the radiator swap.. Extremely easy to use, i have never messed with the coolant system on any of my trucks other than draining and refilling and never had to use a Coolant Vac tool until this truck. Just follow the directions and the tool does all the work.  Simple but Genius design, wish i had thought of it	1
If you own a Diesel you MUST HAVE THIS TOOL!  Way impressed.  It made the changing of my 2003 F350 6.0 PSD Coolant quick and easy.  No more slowly pouring in gallons of fluid in the Degas bottle.  Now it takes less than a minute to refill the coolant.  This is a quality tool well made and did the job perfectly!  Impressed!!	1
This thing is the bomb, heavy and built like a tank.  Don't waste your money on cheaper/frail alternatives.  Once you start using this you'll never fill coolant the traditional way again.	1
I wish they were less expensive, but they truly do a great job. Instead of sizing up to a larger fastener (which is not always possible) you can go right back to using the same size bolt. Fixed my snowblower very quickly. Very easy to use in tapped aluminum castings.	1
Love this kit!  Works exactly or maybe even better than promised. Replaced hoses and thermostat and the kit let me know I had a leak before I filled the system. Corrected the leak, pulled the air out, then let the kit pull in the new coolant. When the pressure got to zero, the system was full. Didn't even have to add coolant to the overflow tank. It was so much fun, I wanted to do my other cars. Not many products work as advertised, but this one does. Some of the best money I've ever spent on tools. High quality, great performance. Glad I bought it.	1
Must have tool for doing any work with cooling system	1
This is an amazing device.  Especially with a truck like mine (heater core is much higher than the rest of the engine) it's almost impossible to bleed all the air from the system.  Follow the instructions, watch a YouTube video or two, and it's super easy to use.  I'll never do coolant again with out it!  I especially like this upgraded version for the solid brass valve/manifold.  The whole process took me literally 10 minutes, and that was with letting it sit for 5-6 minutes under vacuum to ensure the system was sealed.  Buy it, you won't regret it	1
Great for evacuating your coolant system.  You have to have this for rear engine Porsches with front radiators.	1
Really well made tool!	1
The OTC Jeep Service Adapters are a must have if you own a Jeep.  They fit the ball joints perfectly making it easy and safe to remove and install Jeep ball joints.  Great accessory for the OTC ball joint puller!	1
Very high quality tool.  It didn't end up working for my application but returned for no problem refund.	1
Oh my gosh!  This tool saved my sanity.  It is an indespensible tool for ball joints removal and installation on our Grand Cherokees.  It is, literally, the right tool for the right job.  Very well made and packaged.  Truly professional quality.	1
Awesome kit. Worked great on my 1988 Comanche	1
Fits the Dodge ball joint and good quality	1
I used the harbor freight ball joint tool with these and replaced my ball joints without any problems.  I tried using the HB pieces, but I couldn't line them up straight without totally ruining the ball joints.	1
thanks	1
This is a handy tool, especially for modern vehicles cooling systems that don't tolerate an air pocket very well.  It is also nice that the unit functions as a leak tester as well.  It is a little unnerving seeing all of the hoses collapse under the vacuum, but it fills everything right up and no air pockets.  It is also constructed of quality materials and should last a good long time if properly cared for.	1
Great product for use in auto shop or home garage.	1
Makes short work adding coolant.  Good investment. Now I won't keep putting off coolant maintenance	1
works like it should	1
This worked out great. I was worried I would be able to repair the treads on the manifold with the engine still in place. purchased an angle driver to help in tight spot	1
A real life saver.  Had 2 stripped holes in the engine block for my 10 year old snow thrower.  Lucky for me I was able to access the spot with a drill without having to remove any additional parts other than the belt cover.  Used the proper size drill bit from my set (glad they didn't include one in the kit so I didn't have to pay for something I didn't need) and inserted the first helicoil and snapped the bottom off as per the instructions.  The tapping was deeper than the coil insert's length, so I installed a 2nd one in the same hole till it bottomed out on the first one - leaving a portion of the 2nd coil still exposed.  Using the installation tool, I was able to back it out a bit and cut the excess off, screw it back in and now have a fully restored tapping - better than new!  Just make sure the top of the insert is a turn or so below the surface - helps ensure that the insert won't back out as you unscrew the bolt the next time the assembly comes apart.	1
have been doing ball joints on jeeps without it, but this makes it so much easier. Should have got these when I bought the press to start with.	1
Makes changing the ball joints in a Dana 30a breeze.	1
Used this kit to replace ball joints on 2010 Jeep JKU.  It would've been a lot tougher without the kit, but the instructions weren't very helpful for my particular application.	1
Made the steering ball joint replacement a joy on my Jeep GC 98	1
very  nice, well packed	1
Works great for the jeep	1
These adapters made the job easy.  They work great with the new spicer ball joints I got.  The removal cup included was not large enough to go around my factory upper ball joint,  though, during removal.  Fortunately,  there was a piece included with the ball joint press that worked for this.  I used this set with a non- otc press rented from oreilly. No issues with it working with that press.  The cups do work perfect with the spicer ball joints for my jeep tj.  This it is a must,  for installation. Not too necessary for removal but does help greatly.	1
Coupled with the OTC 7249 'kit', this made changing out the ball joints in my Dana 30 a breeze.	1
Best thing since Betty white.  If you have a pressurized cooling system get this. Took me 3 days to get air out of my silverado before this. Now it takes just a few minutes. Love it.	1
I like it but the first car I used it on was a Nissan Altima 2.5 and I still had to raise the front of the car to the moon and run for 45 mins to finally get it to blow heat at an idle	1
Wow wow wow!...for any autotech or diy.....must MUST HAVE!	1
Exactly what I expected.  Very satisfied.	1
first off I a mechanic and have my own shop....its ok, expected it to work better and or easier.....had a 2008 chevy express van, replaced the heater core and you could see it was gonna trap air because of the orientation of the heater core and after using the tool repeatedly it still had crappy heat at idle so it really didn't get out all the air like I hoped it would.	1
Works wonders, I should have bought this sooner. I maintain about 15 cars and filling the cooling system with this tool makes it a snap and the best part is no trap air.	1
This set worked perfectly to remove the ball joints on our 2010 Jeep Wrangler. They are made in China, that's why I didn't give them a 5 star rating.	1
Worked well. Still tough install	1
Believe me it is well worth the price when doing the uppers on your jeep!	1
Used to install ball joints on a 1999 Jeep Cherokee front axle (Dana 30)	1
Worth it.  Buy them, you will thank yourself when you are done with the job.	1
I think these are necessary to change the ball joints. I guess you could do it without them but I would rather spend the extra money and make the job much easier.	1
This is a good quality tool for a special purpose. I believe it works fine for what it is designed. The thing to pay attention to is  which types of trim, and which makes of car.  I was able to use this on some of my trim, but certainly not everything. I think I may have been misinformed about which makes of car it was designed for. It can keep you from damaging some fragile and expensive trims/moldings.	1
Edges are super sharp and actually damaged my glass. Tangs on the end not really skinny enough to do the job.  If you do buy this use some sandpaper or a file to smooth out all the sharp edges.  Material does seem strong and hard tho	-1
Use this tool to remove Ford/GM/AMC windshield molding. I used it to remove a 1996 F-250 chrome front windshield molding. It is more expensive than some of the stamped metal cheapie moulding clip poppers but much nicer to use...less flex, easier on wrist with a more solid feel when on a windshield moulding clip. Arrived quickly and securely packaged. Has my stamp of approval.	1
works exactly as attended, no problems	1
I DO NOT KNOW HOW I LIVED WITHOUT THIS!!	1
Good quality tool. Haven't had a chance to use it, but I'll have it for the next job I do.	1
this is an awesome product. removes the air pockets in the cooling system commonly found in late model engines. highly recommend if you do any kind of service work on your own vehicles.	1
Couldn't get the adapters to fit 2007 boxster coolant tank	-1
worked for a custom hp 44 i built in my cherokee rock crawler. Fit the angle of the inner C's accurately. this part with the otc press and air tools made all 4 ball joints a 30 minute job	1
Worked great.  The installer is angled so ball joints can be pressed in straight without the need for washers or shims.  The cutout in the receiver means it fits perfectly for the lower ball joint.  Made in China.	1
The adaptor makes easy work pressing new ball joints into a Dana 30 front axle.	1
Saved my bacon. Works perfectly, much better than the POS from Harbor Freight. Fits the unusual angle of the Dana 30/Dana 44 front axle C. No fumbling with generic parts to try and get it to fit. No pieces of steel stuck between the cup and the axle. No compromises. These fit the Jeep Dana 30 axle ears perfectly.	1
Great quality and works as expected	1
Worked great on removal and installation of upper and lower ball joints on 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Already had the C-press.	1
I've seen them in use but never used one, some instructions would have been handy. They seem to slip into the clip and allow you to pull them to the clip's larger hole so they pop off the studs the clips are held in by. When they are pulled in that manner they lower and loosen grip on the trim and you can remove trim and remove clips from around your windshield or rear window for resealing or replacement.  1 star off for no instructions.	1
A little pricy but it worked as advertised.	1
Worked great on my 87 Buick Grand National windshield molding.  I did not break any clips or bend any moldings upon removal.	1
works well if its in the exact right spot, could be a little thinner and angled more to fit ford clips easier but all and all works better than using a screwdriver or hook	1
couldn't get the molding off without putting little notches in the chrome at the contact point. could have done better with a flat head screwdriver.	-1
Seems like every clip is different.  Modified one side for my job & it worked fine	1
very good product when you need to get all air out of cooling system to prevent air lock and causeing  engine damage	1
just used this to do coolant changed on my 2006 dodge ram 2500 and 2007 4runner. this UView 550000 make changing coolant so much easier and faster. I would recommand to product to anyone who is on the fence of thinking about buying this. Buy it!! it's worth the money. it is made in Canada not in China!!!!!! -:).	1
Excellent.  Well made of brass and makes filling cooling systems lightning fast.	1
Couldn't be happier. Same as snap-on RADKITPLUSA. But half the price. I  only wished i would've bought it years ago.	1
worked perfect for my 94 Jeep ZJ dana 30 knuckles.  I had to improvise a cap since my OTC ball joint press didn't come with one. Used a small piece of 1/4 plate to get the job done.	1
Man did these things come in handy! Well worth investing in this tool instead of paying the mechanic. Now I can charge my friends beer money to do their ball joints!!	1
this tool set made ball joint service a breeze for me - i am not a mechanic but it surly made it easy to complete the job	1
the angeled adapter is the real trick in this set. gets things straight on the first round, less hazzel. durable too !	1
this is well worth the money an it really works great. i recommend it to anyone who has to replace jeep ball joint. it cut the time in half at least.	1
I use this on my Honda Goldwing to ensure there's no air in the cooling system after replacing the coolant.  Works like a charm.  Very high quality tool.  Well worth the money.	1
Great product, fast, and easy. Great seller!	1
I worked in a few automotive shops in the past and the lead mechanic always told me I needed something to test and fill radiator jobs. I bought this one to assist in the replacement of a radiator on my Jeep and could not be happier. It helped me identify another leak in a hose during the process saving me a bunch of time, money and troubleshooting. It makes a vacuum to pull the fluid into the tank without creating air pockets that can lead to overheating as well.	1
Works fantastic! Easiest way to flush your radiator.	1
Works great	1
The only way to positivly fill a cooling system.	1
Works as it should.  No more mess/waiting/guessing/hoping/hassle.	1
Useful	1
If you have a Jeep Wrangler with the stock factory black plastic extended fenders, this is a must tool to have to replace the fender mount tabs that seem to brake when you go out in the trails. So much better that trying to fight with a screwdriver to get the mounting tabs replaced. This tool works on any flat plastic mounting tab.	1
Great product item was as described	1
Tool is great for application, cheaper than local stores.	1
Great tool for removing automotive door panels: so much better than using a plain screw driver. LOVE it!	1
I used this to remove and insert the ball joints on a 2002 TJ jeep.  It was easy to use and fits exactly, Right tool for the job.  Made removing them very easy.	1
item is as described, it's quality made, so far it's holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.	1
I changed the joints on my Jeep and even with the cost of the remover set and this adapter it was still less than having a shop do it.	1
I have an 07 Jeep Wrangler which is one of the vehicles that this kit is for. Trouble is that the part with the notch cut out (the largest piece) isn't deep enough for use with a stock ball joint as their own instructions describe. Plus it is made out of material that is too thin-walled so the inside diameter is too wide. This allows it to slip off the ball joint lip as it is being pressed into place.  When I buy a special tool that is designed for use with my vehicle, I would expect it to work. Got to wonder if they ever actually tried it before they said it fits.  EDIT: I have been informed that this kit is not designed for the JK Wrangler (mine is a Rubicon but the BJs should be the same as Sport and X models) and Amazon's description is/was at fault. I don't know for sure how to both inform others of this and review a product that I've never been able to use in accordance with its design. OTC is an excellent company, and based upon other reviews, I suspect that this kit is likewise great. So I'm speculating by upgrading my 2 star review to a 5 star one. But JK owners beware...this kit doesn't work well on your Jeeps regardless of what Amazon's description says.	1
Great price, great tool, just as described. What else can I say? It gets the job done. It is a must have when replacing the ball joints on my 2001 Jeep TJ.	1
These worked great to remove and replace the ball joints on the Dana 30 axle under my 1998 Jeep Wrangler TJ.  The quality is far superior to the Chinese Tool Store stuff.  It costs more, but is very much worth it. The removale tool is angled perfectly for the Dana 30.	1
A Perfect must have mechanic tool.	1
GREAT PRODUCT AND GOOD QUALITY	1
awesome product I highly recommend	1
Works great. I have used it several times with no problems. It gets all the air out and you will know if you have a leak in your system before you add any coolant. Very well made.	1
Used it many times.  High quality unit, works well.	1
this is a very good tool. I can't understand how it works but it is great when I change the coolant in my vehicles.	1
This product is worth every dollar and more. High quality, and the ease of refilling your cooling system with no air gaps left in system. With this tool it literally took no longer than 2/3 min. To refill my engine block, radiator and heater cores. Slick system. Got to have!	1
Makes it a lot easier to remove the plastic fasteners on the engine cover in my car. Glad I made the purchase. Can recommend this item.	1
Arrived on time.... works perfect...	1
Worked good, not great.  A high quality tool for sure.  But my screwdriver performed almost as good.	1
Looks like it will work ok	1
Item arrived on time as ordered great product and good price.	1
Handle fell apart, cracked and delaminated. Looks like the injection of the plastic shot wasn't hot enough to merge all the plastic properly. Was probably one of the first injections of the day or improper shot settings.	-1
Good.	1
good	1
Great tool that makes releasing the torsion bars quick & easy...and much safer than using a puller hooked to the lips of the crossmember.  Tool came in an OTC box but casting says J42393 KENT-MOORE.	1
High quality materials and components.  Does a good job of getting the coolant in, safely and quickly.  However, I had some issues with getting the grommets to stay in place.  Can't move them or they lose there seal.  Easy to work around.	1
Simple and by far the best way to fill our race cars coolant system without air pockets.	1
Works as expected	1
one of the best tools you can get for filling automotive cooling systems- you won't have air pockets when using this	1
This tool is amazing.  First of all the craftsmanship is outstanding.  It is almost like a work of art!!  Now as to it's function:  I used it to help me flush my cooling system on my 77 Mercedes 300D.  These cars are known to be almost impossible to fill with coolant due to air pockets.  Well, not when you're using this thing.  I flushed and drained 3 times with water and a wetting agent and then I flushed with a dilute solution of Shout cleaner to remove any hint of an oil residue.  I then, after rinsing the Shout out two times, did a dilute Citric Acid flush.  I followed that with two water/wetting agent flushes.  I then drained everything and pulled a vacuum on the system and let it sit for the better part of a day in order to check for leaks.  Finding no leaks I filled the system with waterless coolant.  This tool is a marvel!!	1
Works great and at a fraction of the cost of a Snap-on or MAC.	1
Works perfectly every time. I had borrowed this many, many times from my co-workers to fill 2.4L (new "world motor" dual thermostat type) and 3.6L Chrysler engine cooling systems after cooling system or engine work seeing as this type of tool is the only way to get those cooling system types full of coolant. You can't beat it. Even with a cooling system that can be filled effectively with the "funnel on the radiator cap" method this is faster and more effective and that means money if you're flat rate.	1
Used a universal tool, and it bent under the pressure when trying to load the new torsion keys back into an 05 Silverado. This tool worked effortlessly and was DEFINITELY worth the money. Super glad with the product.	1
Makes the job SO much simpler and safer.  Just seems kind of pricy for what it is.  I was shocked when it arrived at how BIG and BEEFY it is, which made me feel better about the price.	1
Expensive, but made the simple and safe.  I wouldn't do the keys without it	1
great tool, works great. makes changing the tortion bar adjusters & keys very easy to change.	1
done the job and sold it for almost as much as I paid for it. Nice to see made in the USA tools	1
Not used in anger yet but seem okay, more of there if needed tool for me. Casting quality is not bad and much better than some I have seen. The conincal base on the shafts means that the forces is NOT transmitted via the thread which is good. The pnematic hammer shaft fits my generic hammer okay.  As a side note there is a debate if pickle forks are good to use, generally they can damage the joint so best to replace. Use a bolt type UJ splitter if you have to re-use parts.	1
Nice kit, multifunctional.  Prefer the popping tools but when you need a fork, why not buy US quality since it isn't much less than HF anymore.	1
I have owned this kit for 4+ years now, and the kit has proved to be a usefull tool. Recently I broke one of the forks and haven't been able to find a replacement single fork. I see the kits all over the net but I cant seem to find replacement parts.	1
After buying and returning the GRIP set, I ordered these.  What a difference.  This set is night and day better than the other.  Handles screw in straight, casting marks are mostly ground away, and the shank for the air hammer actually fits like it's supposed to.  Well worth the money to get this kit over the other.  Very satisfied.  As a side note, on the back of the package label, it indicates that the end of each handle (or hammer adapter) has a point at the end which drives the tool, rather than driving by the threads.  This should prevent thread deformation under high impact.  Very nice touch.	1
Excellent tool for loading and unloading torsion bar keys. Very simple and safe to use.. WARNING: Loading and unloading torsion bar keys can be dangerous! Use caution!	1
Works great	1
What needs to be said OTC quality	1
not a great tool	-1
OTC is absolutely the best! I love their products, it worked like a charm! No way I could have done the job without it!!	1
Very good quality product. It works as expected.	1
Fast shipping, works great!	1
Works great.	1
tool great for the repair	1
Little sharp it can take the paint right off.	1
Excellent tool to use whenever you do any coolant system work.	1
Love it!  Plug and play!  High quality parts and carrying case.  FYI:  Had to purchase a 1/4 inch adapter to connect to my compressor -- There is no mention of this on the Amazon listing but it is one of the first things mentioned in the instructions (after I purchased it).  Also, per the instructions, the Airlift system requires 24 to 26 inches (vacuum) on the gauge before the system should be activated.  This means that if you have a low output compressor (less than 90 psi constant output), you could have problems reaching the 24 to 26 inches of vacuum for the Airlift to do its thing.	1
great tool and good value,  ive used this tool a number of times since receiving it, it works great, saves  a lot of time , easy to use. it arrived in the time promised, good customer service. I highly recommend this tool.	1
Amazing tool, makes confirming leak repairs and filling a total breeze! Make sure to rinse the tool and lube the threads, and it will last a lifetime! ZZ	1
Very easy to use, can't believe I never bought this before so easy to vaccum leak test and to refill with coolant right away no need to wait to fill up radiator and less of the spills	1
Made filling up my Polaris RZRS 800 a breeze. No mess. No air pockets.	1
Seemed like a good tool however, the one I received looked like it had been used before . So, I returned it. To expensive to pay for a used tool.	1
Tool arrived in great condition and to my surprise it was made in American, maybe I lucked out on this one.  This tool is specifically designed to remove and install the torsion bar suspension on my specific year model truck.  Caution!  One should always be sure to get the correct tool for the job and your specific application.  This type of suspension if not removed correctly will and can cause sever injury to you.  By all means do this as specified by the manufacture.	1
These work as advertised and at a fair price. Using them with my air hammer made changing tie rod end a snap.	1
I finally got to use this set last weekend.  It saved me a lot of time.	1
This set is perfect. I like that I can interchange between a striker and an air hammer handle. This one kit is basically like having 6 different pickle forks. The quality is very nice and I'm sure they will last a long time if used properly. I have many other Lisle tools and you really can't go wrong with them.	1
Well designed product.  Nice beefy threads.  Easy to assemble.  Individual pieces are available on the internet.  I would recommend this product for professional used.	1
Great little kid you can use it with a hammer well with a rivet gun I found it to work best with a sledge.	1
as a professional mechanic i've been using my lisle set for years. These are excellent. All my lisle tools have been infallible so far. Ive even accidentally gouged steering knuckles with these, a testament to their strength, density, and hardness. And i've beaten on them with sledge hammers with great fury.	1
It's a good set came in a nice package	1
Works perfectly, haven't run into a car that it won't fit yet.	1
Solid built, easy to use, performs flawless	1
Would recommend this to every mechanic. Makes filling cooling systems effortlessly. Great time saver.	1
Works perfect. Very easy to use. I used this while replacing the lower control arms on my silverado.	1
Worked really well. Item as decribed	1
Bent after first use.  I had to use a regular gear puller to complete the job.  Returned item without any difficulty	-1
Did what it is supposed to. No better alternative.	1
works as it should	1
Very usefull this tool for fasteners.	1
Very handy tool to have. Makes removing plastic fasteners a breeze. Fasteners can be reused if they're not damaged, this tool works great. The correct tool for any job is the only way to go.	1
Exactly what I needed and fit perfectly!	1
That's how useful and awesome this product is.  My life is complete due to lisle 35260!	1
Perfect for popping those little suckers out without breaking them. Love it!	1
looks like it should work fine, haven't needed to use it yet.	1
this is an extremely invaluble tool. a must for every mechanic or shop.	1
Fabulous - don't know how I ever got along without it.	1
Good quality tool. That's saying a lot these days.	1
awsome, love it	1
Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but am impressed with the quality build of the machined brass components. As noted from other reviews, just be cautious and do not drop the gauge. A nice touch on the gauge would have been a rubber outer cover.	1
Worked good on porsche boxster Only way to put coolant in	1
Look great.  Hope they work for my front end.	1
Thanks	1
One of those tools that you need once in a blue moon but when you do they are worth their weight in gold. Makes removing ball joints a breeze. Only thing, though; the plastic packaging doesn't lend itself to keeping the bits organized in the tool drawer.	1
Very good quality for the money.	1
I used it for steering knuckle removal on 99 jeep wrangler, also tie rod ends and stabilizer removal. Strong and lightweight.	1
OTC made in USA quality,  buy this tool and your set for the rest of your life.  No more driving to and from the machine shop (or twice if they are busy and you have to leave it for the day)  makes ball joint and tie rod ends a snap to replace.  Update:  The tool I got has NO CHINA markings on it at all, the adapter kit I also purchased for my 1999 Taurus is made here in the USA also.  See my photos of the tool in use, note the made in USA label on the frame of the tool.  No I'm not paid to post the stuff.	1
Under $80, From Amazon.com so buy it now and never have to drive round trip to the machine shop at your local parts store !  This tool pays for itself the first time you use it, removes and installs all ball joints. Also good for U joints on rear wheel drive cars.  This is not a junk tool from China, it is USA MADE by OTC.	1
Works as it should. The rubber snugger protects the cars finish.	1
Works.	1
Works fine	1
Works.	1
As advertised. good all purpose angle.	1
Kinda pricey but it was needed to safely do the lift kit. I'm sure I'll use it again in the future but I'm not sure how long that will be. If you can find one to borrow or rent, save some money and do that.	1
I used it on an 04 silverado to install a leveling kit. It worked, enough said.  I recommend some moly grease on the threads.	1
This is a extremely heavy duty tool. This is dealership quality at the cheapest price around. I had to replace my upper and lower arms in my avalanche. Now you need a good tool you trust your life with because if the tool breaks and the torsion bars get loose, you could get hurt or seriously injured up to death. I put my life on the line with this tool and I'm glad I did. HEAVY DUTY!!! Make sure you grease up the threads so YOU don't strip them out.	1
Yup looked all over locally to rent this tool no luck. Bought this tool on amazon and leveled my truck in about an hour. Running a larger exhaust may take you a bit longer time. Recommend 100% get the right tool for the job and save your fingers.	1
Shipped Fast. Fair price.	1
works just as it says so needs more adapters though	1
I used this purge tool kit during the coolant flush and fuel cooler flush on my 2008 Ford F350 diesel 4x4. I wish I would have had this tool years ago, it made filling the systems super easy and prevents the cavitation behind the front cover on my particular model.  I highly recommend this kit.	1
Good product and fast shipping!	1
Quality tool, helpful it comes with both attachments	1
Different size forks are amazing i have used these on tow truck tie rods and auto tie rods and still looks new good quality works perfect with my ir air hammer	1
does what tool made for getting ball joint and tie rod off	1
works great and heavy duty.	1
Good quality material, I like that it is designed for use with air chisels. Just make sure you screw the forks down tight so you do not not strip the threads. I would recommend this produce to anyone needing it.	1
Quality.  Holds up to the worst beatings.	1
Great product great price!	1
Handy little tool. I use it to remove those plastic clips holding it the inner fender wells on my Tahoe. Have to remove the tires and inner fender wells just to change spark plugs. More clearance also helps two install new spark plugs wires.	1
good	1
I have used this tool many times, and owned one before, though because it is such a great tool, it somehow disappeared one day, awhile back, heh. Anyway, it is an essential in an auto technician's role of daily stuff, and when dealing with coolant systems, this draws out all the air bubbles and fills it up so you can get right into your pressure testing, and running, typically without ever having any subsequent thermostat issues. The different size rubber assortment is good and very important. 5 Stars...	1
Very happy  with this product	1
It does what you need it to do.  I was able to put the leveling kit on my Avalanche fast and safely.  Tool works great.	1
To replace the torsion keys/bars, the right tool is a must! I tried using "c" clamps and another type of clamp/puller... 2 broken "c" clamps (yes two) and no results 3 hours later. I broke-down and ordered the $100 tool. Within an hour of receiving it, the job was done. Well worth the cost and wait.	1
Bought this tool to use on my new truck and it broke 1/2 way through the job. Construction seems to be a little cheap.	-1
this is a must have tool no need for skimping its safe and it works great swapped the bars in a snap ...thanks	1
Solid construction, gets the job done. Good seller.	1
Good	1
very useful and handy set of forks if your doing any sort of suspension work.	1
GOOD TOOLS	1
These save a lot of time if you are a alignment person.	1
Tough as nails, and SUPER handy.  I love that the hammer screw-on is actually pretty short.  I don't like using a hammer on pickle forks when they're a foot long or so.  This lets you get into tight spaces and still have room and angle to swing a mallet or hammer.  Also, the air attachment obviously makes things VERY handy.	1
Great tool at a good price	1
thanks	1
Pretty simple tool for working on ball joints in late sixties and newer Dana axles on four-wheel-drive domestic trucks. The nice thing about this, besides the solid construction, is that you're getting a quality, American-made tool and not some import junk that is going to break on you at the worst possible time.  For something like ball joints, where do-overs are expensive and tool breakage is not an option, step up to US-made quality and pick up one of these. I'm very satisfied with mine and I would definitely buy it again at twice the price.	1
Hand to replace gromits and front and rear bumper covers, worked great!	1
This makes taking  the plastic rivets off a breeze.	1
The lever point doesn't seem to do much. I still had to struggle when I removed the fasteners. The tool is very sturdy.	1
I'm a mechanic and this is my most used tool, great for removing crappy plasticintake shrouds for Subarus and the annoying under trays that come on just about every other car these days. Only problem is that I keep leaving them under hoods, lol.	1
Exactly as advertised	1
awesome, would be better yet with a few more adapters for the ever changing cooling system set ups....but, I still love it....great tool....excellent for the Escapes and any other funky multi hosed vehicle	1
Works perfect, every time. I only need to use the cone shape adapter on all the cars that I have worked on. May be better for the regular shadow tree mechanic to buy the cheaper version instead.	1
exelent	1
Work well, but seemed a bit pricey.	1
item is as described.	1
These don't say made in USA.. they don't say at all were they are made.. but they are ok..fit and finish is a bit sloppy..im sure they are import. didn't use yet.i hope they hold up	1
Good quality fork kit that makes separating ball joints a breeze.	1
they work but have uneven surfaces	-1
good product	1
Good quality tool	1
Not much to say here.  It works well.  There are no burrs or rough edges.  Very good quality.	1
Neat tool  easy to do	1
Works well!	1
Must have for any mechanic.	1
One of those tools that you never need until you REALLY need it. Worked exactly as it should and looks like its made out of decent metal so it should last for a long time.	1
If you have a jeep with dana 30 or 44 this tool is a must have	1
Good stuff	1
Yes, made in the USA.  Praise Jesus.  A little confusing when you open it up and find empty slots within the case, good foresight on OTC's part.	1
Yup, made in the good old U.S.A.!  Heavy C-Frame press that will take the torque needed to break loose those rusted ball joints on your Dodge Cummins 3500 4x4.  Worked great for me, although the bushings were not exactly the sizes I needed.  I bought the Astro 7868 Master Ball Joint Adapter Set, But still ended up having to fabricate a bushing out of pipe. The Astro set is well made, just didn't have the adapters needed for my project.  I lubed the press screw with aluminum based anti-seize lubricant, which I like, because it doesn't end up dripping all over the place.  I didn't use an impact wrench, but the press screw did hold up when using a two foot breaker bar, probably putting 200lbs. torque on the press screw.  I saw no deflection in the C-Frame, while putting the pressure on it.  Overall, I'm very satisfied and the press should last me forever.	1
Used this on some very tough ball joints,even used it with impact. Just keep threads well lubed.	1
Just wanna add that this is the tool that Mac passes off as their own.  Got a mac and it clearly said otc and made in usa.  It sells for about 250 off the truck.	1
Still using after a few years and still going strong, its a must have for ball joints and ujoints so far it seems to take the abuse I throw at it. One tool everyone should have in the tool box. Reason for the 4 star is the coating cracked and pilled off first use.	1
Product as expected.	1
great product	1
Good name brand tool, works good.	1
OK	1
ordered another tool and got this thing to much of a pain to return as it was low cost	-1
this item is of very high quality	1
Works very well use it on JD tractor and Goldwing	1
I have used this tool roughly twice a week for the last 8 months and it has held up great with no leaks. My only gripe is that it needs to have a longer suction hose. It can't reach the overflow tank on any semi truck.	1
I can't say enough good things about this tool. Just follow the simple instructions and you will do a bubble-free, mess-free, and quick refilling of your coolant system. The only thing worth mentioning is that you don't need to use the tightest grommet. You can pick one size smaller and just used the adjustment screw to tighten the grommet on the coolant reservoir to make a great seal.  Another bonus is that if your system can keep the vacuum for a couple of minutes, you know there are no leaks.	1
This definitely helped speed up the process of my radiator drain/refill. Only downfall is if you have a 150psi compressor it will have a hard time trying to keep up with the suction.	1
A quick way to separate ball joints and tie rod ends. can be used with a air hammer or sledge hammer.	1
Saved me time using my air hammer when rebuilding my suspension on my 2006 Dodge Magnum Srt8.	1
Havent used it yet but I am sure it will work very well.	1
Not sure I would use these for every day needs but for my home needs they worked perfectly.	1
Worked great when replacing ball joints and drag link using a pneumatic hammer.	1
Great product. Works as said. Bust loose BJ's and tie rods ends easily.	1
Bought this set a while back to help me in replacing my ball joints on my dodge truck. Finally got around to using them and they worked great. There are three different sizes to choose from. I used two of the three, and could not have gotten by with just one size. One reason I chose this set is because you can use them with a air hammer.	1
Used these to get the knuckle off the end forging on my axle.  Did the job and had no issues.  Impressed with the quality of the material thus far.	1
Ball joint work on factory ball joints on a 1972 c10, of course you need to get the air hammer to go with this set or a heavy sledge hammer!!! However when I was done and wiped away the grease, there was no damage to the tools!!! Well worth the price and are store with storing oil so they won't be rusted and seem fresh from the factory so keep a rag on hand when opening!!!	1
Solid piece of equipment. Worked great with the Jeep adapters. Made the it easy to press out and in the ball joints.	1
Great tool to have	1
Very good quality	1
A must have tool for a car mechanic removes trim pieces without damaging them. I have used to install stereos in several cars. The quality of the product is excellent. Could be a bit cheaper.	1
Works great for pulling out fender clips. I use it all types of auto clips on fenders, door panels, etc.	1
Works great	1
Good	1
Good quality	1
work's great	1
This tool is the cat's meow.  Purchased to use on my Honda Goldwing, but have used it on all my bikes, my quads, and my cars.  Eliminates air bubbles from the cooling system completely - no need to bleed or "burp" at all.	1
Easy to use and does what it is supposed to do.	1
Truly an awesome tool! I first read about the Airlift in a motorcycle magazine some time ago. In my shop, when we do coolant drain/flush/refill, there are always air pockets that have to be 'burped out' on the cooling system after the refill. The airlift makes the whole process, fast and easy. On a typical motorcycle with one or two radiators, to create the vacuum in the cooling system and then refill takes maybe 3 minutes, including disconnecting/connecting the air compressor line from the tool.  Not sure about the lower cost plastic version, but the brass construction version is certainly worth the money. it's a real time saver.	1
This worked really well when I replaced the coolant in my Goldwing it made refilling a snap. I had to adjust some stuff in the beginning until I had the hang of it. Everyone should have one.	1
This made my coolant change a breeze and my power steering fluid a breeze. I bought it mainly for my truck, but have used it on several cars and such and worth every penny. Well built, easy to use and saves lots of time and potential engine damage.	1
Used it once on my 97 f350 to change a tierod end and it worked. I used it with a little craftsman air hammer and after a while of hammering when I was about to give up on it I fell forward from the tierod end breaking free. I'm giving it a 4 just because the castings look a little cheap to me but if it holds up over time I might change it later.	1
As a Technician I see a lot of cars, as a Technician in a snow state, rust makes a simple job harder. Replacing tie rods or anything with a joint is no match. Due to rust this joints can become very well seized, If replacement is needed with a new one then I use my air hammer with appropriate size and the joint comes loose in an instant. Turns lengthy difficult jobs into easy ones. I would recommend it to anyone dealing with suspension work. Do not use if you plan on reusing joint, A puller would save the grease boot from damage.	1
This is the best of this design puller. Worked really well. I have broken some other brands This keeps telling me I have to type more words	1
LIKE IT	1
works great	1
good tool	1
Works. Be nice if angle we're increased a bit.	1
I used it to replaced Universal Joint on my Tacoma 2005. It made my work a bit easy even though I'm struggling. To have this is so much better than using a hammer I think.	1
So I got the tool yesterday after using the China made one for multiple hours with no success I put this one to use and wham bam thank you mam it was done pushed it right in! I bought this because it was made in USA and wanted quality and only other one I know of that actually made in USA is snap on and it's over 600 dollars. I read reviews of some people saying it was made in china but mine was stamped made in USA and it sure performed like it was. I love it	1
Worked good. However, It was not enough to remove the lower ball joint from my 2004 Dodge RAM 1500. I needed a supplemental kit that had the correct parts to fit on the Dodge knuckle (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00061SGPO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_29). Both of these together and you should be able to replace any ball joint on any car/truck :)  Made in the USA is stamped into the steel. The Chinese versions seem to bend easily (just watch some YouTube videos).	1
Yes, this is the press that you want for ball joints.  Works on U joints too.	1
If you work on car s and usually do change coolant you should have one, it is quality product and work as pro.	1
This gadget works amazingly well for checking for leaks, and then filling your system without bubbles.  You need a bucket big enough to hold all the coolant the system requires.	1
Bought to use on a 1999 VW Beetle.  Worked great!  I don't use it to fill fast, i used this to get rid of trapped air and it worked great, no bleeding required.  I also used this to vacuum and fill a ambulance that had coolant lines throught entire vehicle for interior heating.  This worked first time no need to vacuum several times.  System took 8 gallons of coolant. Cons DO NOT USE THIS TO CHECK FOR LEAKS.  When a system draws a vacuum it sucks hoses closer to pipes so if you have a loose clamp this WILL NOT tell you,	1
Worked exactly as described.  Used it on my 2005 Prius for the engine and inverter cooling systems and was very happy with the tool.  I especially liked the carrying case that keeps all the fittings together.  Very glad I bought it.	1
I have used it on a couple import car front end side jobs. Good quality and easy to use.	1
Could not have done the job without these tools!! Perfect.	1
Construction of this tool and it's box are spot on. The tool worked flawlessly.	1
Used in F-350 front end overhaul.  Nice heavy duty press.  Also used bushing/collar adapter kit of various sizes which I found helpful during the job.  Grease the lead screw thoroughly with EP grease before using.  Less effort needed, you won't gall the threads, and the tool will last much longer.  You're getting greasy anyway, right???	1
I used it to service a 98 Jeep Cherokee XJ and it worked flawlessly, even with the tremendous force I had to apply to install the new ball joints. I only used the C-clamp of this tool, together with their&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OTC-7894-Jeep-Dodge-Ball-Joint-Service-Adapter/dp/B0002SRGW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OTC (7894) Jeep/Dodge Ball Joint Service Adapter</a>. The tool is heavy and well resistant but to avoid breaking it during installation, I put it under good pressure and hit a few times around the ball joint with a hammer to help it enter, like I did when removing the old ones. The case is also of good quality, as always with OTC, and whats nice is that theres enough room in it for their Jeep adapter #7894.	1
Helpful tool great price	1
item as described and fast shipping	1
used once to remove door panel on 1996 truck and worked fine, saved time and parts.	1
Great	1
Good Product. Would Buy Again. *Did NOT come with the rubber paint protector at the bend.*	1
very hard the material of the legs of this product use it and leave the marks very visible taking into account that it is used in plastic materials of the different parts of the car.	-1
The hammer part that Screws  in bent and is broken after using one time and i only hit it with a hammer four times.	-1
Good tools for the price, just got it recently so do not know how it will perform in the long run, feel sturdy and good construction.	1
BOUGHT THESE TO REMOVE THE NO GREASABLE BALL JOINT IN MY 85 FORD VAN THEN GOING TO DO MY 08 FORD P/U.  WORKED GREAT ON THE 85 WITH A 3LB HAMMER. DIDNT GET TO THE 08 YET BUT I WILL..............	1
Men,  I used this kit to change the Tie rod ends on my 1999 Lexus RX-300 with 120K miles. The Tie rods ends where still good. I just thought it might be time for ball joints & Tie rod ends as I was buying new tires? I'm hoping to put another 100K on my boat hauling SUV.  This tool did the job, with ease. I now have it to leave to my grand kids. Saved Bu-Cuo dollars from having the Lexus Stealer do the job!  This package of Forks (3) was priced much less at Amazon than other net & brick/mortar stores in my hood (Fort Myers, FL). Amazon shipped it for free within 3 days and no sales tax (don't you just love it?).  Rascal	1
I've had this lisle tool for years.  Coupled with an air chisel this make child's play of removing ball joints and tie rod ends.	1
Worked perfect	1
If you are working on a dana 44 front axle, you will need this tool to set the ball joint preload properly. This is a well made tool and have used it many times working as an auto tech.	1
It did what i needed it to do. Its a solid and sturdy tool.	1
This is one of those tools, if you work on cars, that you always need, but never seem to want. Yet you will always use. Well I finally bought one and this worked out great. It's made well enough for the home mechanic. Just take care of it and use it for what it's intended. I have used it several times and it works great. I wish I had bought it years ago.	1
Fantastic tool to have when you need one.	1
Nice quality tool	1
Recommend you use this clip remover and use a large plastic putty knife to lift the door panel.	1
the tool spun in the handle pretty much on first use.	-1
sleeves bent on me, returning this item.	-1
This quality tool gets the job done.	1
Nice kit made in usa	1
This press is really built like a tank! Great quality and totally saved my butt when doing u-joints on my 06 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel! I'm sure this will last a long time, I'm very happy with it and glad I spent the $$ on it.	1
Used this on over 100 cars.  Perfect coolant fill everytime.  No issues and no air pockets. Better than those coolant flush machines you need to hook up and then puts air in the system when you reconnect the hoses.  High quality recommend for autoshop use.	1
But then, it is supposed to!  I made a little modification to it so I can switch between vacuum, and sucking in the coolant.  Works easier now rather than swapping out the lines.  This is the best thing to assure that your cooling system doesn't leak, and to get all of the coolant into the system without including air.	1
I had never used such tool and had a hard time purging air from the cooling system before when I did not have it. I always doubted if the air was all out. But now I KNOW! I was a breeze to use the tool. I does what it says it will do. Easy to read. Do I recommend the tool? of course even to ones who don't even need it.... lol	1
This tool is worth it. It can be used for more than popping out plugs on cars. Great buy!	1
It's a good tool for it's purpose	1
Worked good	1
love how easy this tool makes your life	1
Nice tool,  using it a lot now.	1
Made in USA.  I was able to pull the ball joints out of a 2003 F350 6.0 diesel with an pneumatic impact driver.  Showed no signs of flex.  I did need Otc 222305 Receiving Tube and Otc 38354 Receiving Cup to get enough clearance, but I knew that from other reviews from people that did 1 ton Ford trucks/vans.  The case it comes with has a few empty spots so I can put the extra pieces in there for storage.	1
Made in the USA.  Quality tool.  This is totally worth it.  Changed both my lower ball joints on my F150 with ease.  I ordered and used the master ball joint adapter set with this.  You can also rent tools like this at the auto parts store as well.	1
Got a Harbor Freight Ball Joint press I bought for $89.00. Was doing ball joints on 2001 Jeep XJ. Got one upper joint off, tried to get lower off, it just kept turning, and turning. Loosened it up. The C was bent so bad, jack screw wouldn't go through bottom hole anymore. Ordered The OTC 7249, Got the other side done in about 30-45 min. Worked great!!!!!! This was less than $20.00 more so why is it sooo much better!!!!!!!! You can see the quality difference in the two side by side.	1
Very robust, well designed and built.	1
Worked great to pull and push the ball joints in my 2000 XJ. Feels sturdy and hopefully will last a lifetime. One of the cups is a touch to big for the lower ball joint, I went to Harbor Freight to get an adapter set, but that is not a fault of this tool.	1
This is a quality ball joint and U joint set. Made installing so much easier. Thanks Amazon	1
OTC tools are high quality Amazon price is lowest.  I got my tool for $152 other tool sites wanted over $185 plus s/h.  Use super saver shipping and save more money.  Time to retire my old SGC Tool Aid spring compressor and use the OTC tool.  The SGC is still useful for straight springs on cars and trucks but you can't compress the strut springs to remove the strut nut safely.  This OTC tool will compress the spring correctly and most important safely.  You can get hurt bad if the spring slips off using the cheap tools out there.  Invest in this OTC too now, instead of driving to the machine shop and spending money and time for the shop to swap the springs out you can do it in less then the time it takes to go to the shop and save the labor fee.	1
OTC 6494 Strut Spring tool is a VERY well made tool and very easy to use. This tool is MUCH safer to compress the springs than the use of the two threaded rod type compressors (I had one fail and the spring "exploded" and I nearly lost the tip of my finger.) This tool hold the spring securely no slipping and very strong. Cheap insurance.	1
great to have when needed	1
Handy tool to have.	1
Must have for .ca. am maverick...makes pulling tabs so much easier!!	1
Purchased this tool as I'm always trying to use a screw driver to pop out plastic plugs on the vehicles. It does not work on wheel well liner plugs as the heads are designed to pop off of those. But the plugs that have a center pin that you can pop up with a screw driver then pop right out with this tool. Also, trim molding, door panels, and wire bundles attached with a pop in clip all come out real easy with this handy tool. Very high quality tool. Heavy duty thick shaft, and a handy hard rubber pivot to protect your paint or plastic.	1
Nice pry tool. Say a technician on you tube using one, he recommended it so I bought one.	1
great tool	1
Worked great on my GM corporate 10 bolt front axle, nice quality tool.	1
Works great! As described. I would purchase again.	1
Makes installing Dana 44 upper balljoints much easier with proper tools, this was strong enough to remove old sleeve too.	1
I ordered this for my husband he says it works perfect	1
I have not had the chance to use this yet. Very nice quality.	1
Nice piece. Very strong, made in the USA!	1
great product	1
must have tool works great and strong	1
used it to replace the ball joints on my dodge ram cummins. I ended up getting a Chrysler kit with it to do the job. The c frame is very rigid and you need to grease the screw before using it.	1
Really awesome tool and made in USA.	1
works great	1
Excellent product. Well made in the USA.  I used in in conjunction with the Powerbuilt 641322 Ball Joint Adapter Kit for Ford to replace the ball joints on a 2005 Ford Taurus.  I was impressed with how well the OTC tool performed, especially since this was my first time to use such a tool..	1
Great tool for ensuring that you don't have an air-locked cooling system. I bought it to swap out the Cummins orange coolant for Evans waterless on a 6.7L diesel. By pulling 22" of vac for 45 minutes (until I had no more vapor coming out of hose) I could be sure that all the old coolant was gone.  Pulled 3.5 gallons in very quickly, but I had to pull a bit more vacuum and take a bit more time to get the last 1.5 gallons in. It would probably not be an issue on a smaller system.  Good quality brass is a nice touch in our modern plastic everything world. This is one of those tools you can hand down to your grandchildren...if they can figure out what its for.	1
One little trick I had to fill the line in the Bucket with the vacum pull  , then close it off and revacum the system That way no air could get back in. The fill line would have air in it before you start to refill the radiator.  This system worked very well	1
This saves me so much time and guesswork it's not even funny.  I never have to worry about air pockets or getting a good 50/50 mix.  Just mix it up in a 5 gallon bucket, stick in the suction hose and let 'er rip!  Fills the cooling system in less than a minute and eliminates any chance of an air bubble.  Can't believe I've gone so many years without this.  Imagine all the headaches I could have saved myself!	1
Works great	1
works as expected	1
does the job	1
This is great tool. Glad I added to my collection.	1
works as it should, no complaints.	1
As always OTC has great stuff. This is a MUST for changing ball joints.	1
The OTC 7080 Is a great tool and does exactly what you need it to do.  The tool makes it easy to torque to spec's.	1
this tool is only good in installing new balljoints if u are trying to remove the old one it slips	-1
Needed this to install ball joints properly. Worked great,fit well and was hardened properly to hold up to tightening with any wrench	1
I thought this would of been a flimsy tool but it turns out to be good and sturdy. The ears take a good deal of force	1
This ball joint removal tool in injunction with the Jeep service adapter accessory made what is usually a difficult and time consuming job EASY PEASY!  This unit is really beefy and doesn't bend or distort under load.  It simply owns the ball joints and pushes them right out.  In my circumstance I also bought the Jeep service adapters which fitted my 2013 JKUR perfectly.  The Jeep service adapter took all the guess work out of the job and made it really safe.  Sometimes when you don't have exact service adapters that fit the ball joits perfectly you have to make due and sometimes you have slop.  Under  pressure stacked adapters can shift and come apart and under pressure can launch a hunk of metal like a projectile.  The Jeep service adapter took all the risk out of the job and made it super easy to do.  I really thought this was going to be a nightmare job but that couldn't have been further from the truth.  I highly recommend getting the specific service adapters for your vehicle if they make them.  It made my job safe and EASY PEASY!  OTC (7894) Jeep/Dodge Ball Joint Service Adapter https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002SRGW0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_wCV1ybSC8ZCCJ	1
No idea how anyone has given this kit a good review. Does not even come with a cup deep enough to press a Ball Joint back into place!?!?! Flat out denied me a refund. Beware in the fact you can remove a Ball Joint with this kit alone. But will not be able to replace it w/o compensating. In my case, utilized a flat Pry Bar.	-1
Nice high quality ball joint tool! Glad I got the real deal, hopefully it will last a lifetime!	1
Great tool, super strong. Makes it easy to save money by DIY.  I saved over $900 bucks rebuilding the front end of my F150 myself.  Tool held up great !	1
It's like a puzzle, but once you figure out how it goes, it does a beautiful job.	1
Do you need a $100 radiator filling system?? Probably not but with coolant costing $30 a gallon this can save you money in the long run. What they should be advertising is the fact that when the tool puts a negative pressure on you coolant system you are checking for leaks before adding one drop of coolant. Think about how many times you find a leak after you just poured your $100 of antifreeze in you radiator.  Works as advertised and really is a open the valve and done deal. Buy a Homer bucket at HD to pre mix your coolant and place higher then fill cap.	1
I was very impressed how this tool worked and the quality of  construction. This is for evacuating air from cooling system and to quickly refill system with exact amount of coolant. The newer cars without radiator caps are difficult to get trapped air out abd this solves that problem. I used this to do a coolant system flush on a lexus LS430 (with a radiator cap) and also a chevy suburban. This same company makes another one which is cheaper and from what I read works well also. This tool is professional grade and is built to last.	1
This is a great tool!  Made coolant change easy.  Results = absolutely no air bleeding problems afterwards on a 997.  Follow the instructions carefully and you will be thrilled. Key points:  Read the instructions a couple of times then follow them.  Helped to have&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SightLine-Computer-Glasses-DOC-2-00-BLACK/dp/B00CXX8OZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SightLine Computer Glasses DOC 2.00, BLACK</a>&nbsp;to read the label.... Cannot stop raving about&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SightLine-Computer-Glasses-MICHAEL-2-00/dp/B00CYPRH96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SightLine Computer Glasses MICHAEL 2.00</a>&nbsp;they are great when I am working on my car.  Second, the new coolant gets sucked in quickly!  Be ready.  You don't want to start sucking in air if the suction hose runs dry.  If you are worried this is going to happen, close the ball valve to stop the flow until you have refilled your feed line container.  It is best to use a clean 5 gallon bucket, and a sufficient volume of coolant.  I used a pancake compressor and it worked fine.  You don't need a huge volume of air, but you do need 90psi.  Made in Canada.  Nice workmanship, solid tool.	1
Most special purpose tools are overhyped and under-deliver. That can't be said of the Airlift 550000. Simple, straight forward directions, does what its supposed to do with no fuss. I purchased the brass version, used it for the first time on our 2009 Corvette and it functioned perfectly. Pulled a near perfect vacuum on the coolant system and hooked up the new coolant and within a minute or so, the new antifreeze mixture was drawn into the radiator. Quality tool you will be happy with IMHO>	1
Heavier duty than the photos suggest. I was on the fence because of the price but it makes sense as soon as you open the box.	1
It works very well, but the springs on my truck seem to be at the very upper limit of spring diameter that this can handle. There are (4) pins, one at each corner, that had to be modified so I could engage them. I used a handheld grinder to grind off the lip on each pin so there was a flat spot. Only that flat area would slide past the spring. I don't believe I could fit any larger spring diameter, I was at the max. I put plenty of oil on the bolt and it compressed the spring seemingly without any twisting or bolt bending. It was tough on my compressor/gun as it strained the limits of that as well (I have a Cambell Hausfeld ? gun).  This is not a fun job as the anxiety factor (when spring is compressed and you take off the top shock bolt) is real high. Getting this tool removed, after new shock was in, took a little work as I needed a screwdriver/prybar to get most grips off.  All in all its a sufficient tool for the job.	1
The tool came in missing parts. But had to return it.	-1
Needs safety features included	-1
Strut springs are a breeze with this tool...stay away from the widow-makers!	1
Good quality tool.  Used it to take out a bunch of fasteners so I could remove my bumper cover as part of a headlamp replacement project.  Performed as expected.  This thing will last a lifetime.	1
Does the trick!	1
very good on golf gti boot (hood) pannelling when u fitting rear shocks	1
Cheap, fast shipping, definitely a need item you need if you are a Jeep Wrangler owner. Will shave you a lot of hassle to remove and replace pop rivets and plastic clips on your Jeep Wrangler	1
Great Product	1
This tool is great for pulling fasteners without damaging them. The rubber ball can be slid up and down the tool for your desired leverage point	1
Works	1
A++	1
Great price	1
Must have for ball joints. Other clamps bend and end up useless. The OTC clamp is the best one I've used.	1
Better price than off of the tool trucks. Shipped promptly and works as intended. OTC makes great tools.	1
I work at a GM dealership and a few of us technicians have this tool.  Its awesome at how well it fills the cooling system with no air pockets.  We have used this on a number of different vehicles from Chevys, GMs, Cadillacs, Subarus, and so on.  A must for anyone who works on cars, the time you save pays for this tool in a few jobs.	1
What a great tool you don't have to fill and re pressure test a coolant system with this tool. The tool will not hold vac if you have a leak. I can not pour coolant in as fast as this tool fills a system.	1
This is a great tool that makes changing coolant a very easy task.  I work on a lot of BMW's which typically get air pockets in them when you change your fluid.  It is typically a long and messy process to get the air pockets out, but this tool makes it easy by creating a vacuum which means no air pockets.  Just fill and go.  I have not had an air pocket since using this tool.	1
Makes it a lot easier pulling the nylon Rivets	1
Worked well to help me open the door panels on my 2004 Jeep and 2007 Corolla. It's made well and very sturdy. Be careful though softer plastics can warp or chip a bit if use you too much force.	1
hubby loves it for working on interiors of cars	1
put it under strain today and held up good tool	1
Great buy!	1
Very heavy duty, commercial quality.  It comes with more than enough attachments to get the job done professionally and safely.  I purchased this in conjunction with the OTC 7894 kit for my Grand Cherokee and together solved the issues I had.  The only downside is I wish the "C" bracket was a bit larger.  Great tool!	1
I haven't used this yet, but it appears to be the exact some quality as the rental tool I've used in the past. I will update this review after I swap my ball joints again.	1
Heavy duty will last forever.	1
I went through four lesser brands before pulling my head out and buying a quality tool like this one. Super impressed. Made the job so much smoother when the press doesn't bend.	1
Ordered April of 2016 and the clamp is made in USA. The clamp is very heavy duty. The screw part of the clamp has a steel ball under the work end. I would say that as long as you keep grease on the screw, the clamp will do decades of repair jobs. The plastic case is nice except the latches are plastic, not steel as pictured. The plastic latches do have a hinge, not the bend and break type.  I also ordered the Astro 7868 master ball joint adapter set as other reviewers had recommended. Amazon's reviewers are so good that I check Amazon's reviews, even while shopping in a store. Hope this review helps.	1
As expected.	1
This saves a lot of time and hassle when filling cars with coolant.  No more big air bubbles or anything in cars that are difficult to bleed.	1
It has worked on every model of car I have ever used it on and it has worked flawlessly.  Some times you get it a little overfull and the overflow just spits it out after the car warms up which is not a problem. You have to empty the coolant out of the radiator and drop the lower hose to drain it from the engine before using this tool.  This tool is used on mostly European cars since it's a challenge to use a funnel and not get any air into the coolant system.  The volkswagon models are what you need this tool for, but when used correctly  you can use it for every car.	1
I love the way this works just as described  and fills the cooling system in no time without air pockets	1
Works just as advertised. All I had to do was follow the instructions and this tool worked like a champ. I used it on a Honda Shadow motorcycle to purge and refill the coolant.	1
2013 Subaru Outback 3.6 Replacing both rear OEM shocks with King Springs installed  Used for the first time today, ensured threads were properly lubricated, then completely screwed the bolt through the compressor by hand and back out.  This worked flawlessly for my application. Used with my impact wrench it compresses the spring evenly, and safely.  It is very well built, thick metal and good welds.  Once I received a quote from a local shop for over $300.00 to do the work I decided to invest in this tool and have no regrets.  It came very well packaged; sealed in very thick molded foam.  I reused the rubber netting sleeve that came with the bolt to protect the threads for future use.	1
Makes the job so much easier, plus much safer.  Only regret should have purchased this 4 strut changes ago.  The tools they loan you when you purchase the struts have always made me cringe.  Best part about this is that you can use an impact wrench, VERY STURDY.	1
Don't mess around with safety. If you haveaver used the individual clamps on a strut before you know how hairy it can get. This clam she'll style is so much easier and safe. Used it on my wife's Accura, brothers Chevy Trailblazer, buddy's Mazda. Don't regret the purchase at all.	1
cool	1
Made my life much easier than using a screw driver	1
works great	1
A MUST have to help with taking off those plastic clips. Works perfect!	1
The fattener remover is sturdy by I wish the inner gap would be a little more open, the Nissan plastic fasteners don't fit in it	1
works well	1
great tool	1
I have used this kit countless times. Definitely worth The Investment. I also like the add-on kits made for it. A must have for at-home mechanics	1
It is Made in the USA.  Used it for replacing 4 universal joints worked like a charm.  Just need to be liberal with grease on the screw.  Nice heavy steel.	1
Made in USA...stamped in c clamp with raised letters.....NOT a china model. Worked Great for U joints in s 97 expedition that had been frozen shut with rust for 19 years........ball joint removal is next I see no problem with this tool lasting for years.....	1
I have used this over and over, worth the money!	1
arrived the next day. everything was present and in excellent condition.	1
good	1
much safer and easier to use....highly recommended!	1
Expensive but at least I recognize this manufacture to make legit tools. DIY means it'll cost you more time to figure out the odds and ends due to not working on cars daily. Despite that this tool saved a lot of time and ensured safety that stick compressors can't do. I hope you have space for it. It does take a bit more space to store this even after collapsing everything/	1
Seems like it would work well with larger struts, I used it on an Toyota Camry with the optional bridge adapter model OTC 6583. It was not a safe operation, the retainer pins are on such an angle that they do not lock into the bridge. Also the angle of the clamshell prevents you from compressing the spring evenly (the upper piece with the bridge is angled). It was very difficult for this particular application and with the retainer pins not lining up the benefits of this tool were all negated.	-1
Lifesaver.  I had used the "widow maker" clamps rented by auto parts stores for years.  Always ran a chain through the springs because I had one break on me.  This unit is a beast.  It is very capable of handling even larger SUV springs.  I used it to replace the struts on my Ford Expedition and wife's VW with no problem.  Great purchase.  Highly recommended.	1
item is as described, it's quality made, so far it's holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.	1
Great product. I used it to refill the cooling system on my car. It was probably unnecessary but I didn't want the hassle of burping the system or otherwise trying to get the air out of the cooling system. It works exactly as described. I drained the coolant on my car and replaced both rad hoses so I figured air would be everywhere inside and this would help. Even if I use it once it's paid for itself over having a shop do the drain/refill or flush procedure. I was quote like $150 or $160 by the local dealer to do a flush, I paid that, did it myself and had this tool left when I was done for future coolant flush jobs.  The only slight issue I had is that I don't think I had enough PSI from my compressor. I had to do the procedure twice, as in fill up the system most of the way, then run it again to suck the rest of the air out, I couldn't pull enough vacuum out on the first try.  I did have to top up the coolant bottle the next day after driving, but I didn't have to add much so this thing definitely works.	1
I first learned of this tool from a friend that's a mechanic. So, when I was working on a car where I thought this would come in handy (2000 VW New Beetle) on, I bought it.  It made life SOO much easier. Although I've only used it one time on one car, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again. I think it's a good tool to have around the shop!	1
Just use ( 10-25-2012) to change engine & hybrid coolant systems in my 2007 Toyota Prius WOW did this work or what it took me and a buddy under 2 hours to change both and the spark plugs. did need two people one to hold unit stable and one to do the valve work and hose changing. hybrid system gurgled for 30-60 seconds then smoothed out and sounded perfect. I highly recommend this tool, best $120 tool I have ever bought	1
Excellent	1
Works perfectly.	1
A must have in the auto industry, even if you use it once, it will save you from replacing the factory retainers which can be a PITA and time consuming.	1
Having the right tools always makes a job easier	1
I like using these for the fasteners but can never find one when I need it.	1
I purchased this unit thinking it would be a safe and fast way to add coolant to my motorcycle cooling system. Unfortunately the adapter for the radiator neck doesn't come with this unit. Thus making it unusable for my application. Without that adapter I am NOT able to use the unit for my motorcycle.  Hoping it will work for my autos. It should state that it doesn't work on motorcycle cooling systems. I would not have made the purchase.	-1
I am amazed at the number of good reviews Stoner's Invisible Glass Cleaner gets. I bought an aerosol can of Stoner's a couple of years ago because of the good reviews it received. For me it was terrible. It was anything but invisible! It left a haze no matter how many times I applied it and tried to wipe it off. I tried using both lint free cloths and paper towels and it still left a very noticable haze. I stopped using the product and went back to good old Glass Plus. I recently bought a new car and wanting to detail it with the best products I could find, I decided to once again try Stoner's Invisible Glass because of the reviews and perhaps I missed something the first go around or they improved it. This time I purchased the spray bottle and the results were the same...a smudgy haze that could not be removed from the glass. In fact, because it's a new car, the glass was almost perfect anyway and it actually made the glass worse. Again, I went back to Glass Plus with perfect results. I have thrown away a full container of unused Stoner's Invisible Glass for the second time. As the saying goes, "fool me once...shame on you, fool me twice...shame on me." If I could give this product zero stars, I would have. It's that bad!!! Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. Avoid this product or buy it once and try it for yourself. Just keep the good old bottle of Glass Plus on hand, cause you'll be needing it.	-1
I purchased this tool months in advance of my project and it didn't survive one repair job. It's advertised for both positioning the cam and holding it while loosening. My cam gear bolts were factory tightened and still this short handle Lisle tool required a pipe on its end to offset force from my 24" breaker bar. The tool began to bend while loosening the first bolt, and broke in half on the second bolt. Lisle Customer Service Rep told me that the tool "was altered for use" by putting a pipe on it and they do not make a longer tool..... no warranty.	-1
You can't use this item to remove the pulley.  It's used to put it back on. The description and packaging don't make this clear.  WTF. Also, you can make the same tool and accomplish the same objective with a nut, washer and bolt. To make a long story short, I feel like I was defrauded out of $25.	-1
POOR QUALITY,  AND MADE IN TAIWAN. OTC IS JUNK NOW!!!!!!!!	-1
Worked reasonably well when I first got it, but it is not robustly made.  When working on my truck recently, I pushed a little too hard on the spark plug cap to seat it onto the top of the tester, and I realized that there was no longer a spark gap inside!  The electrode can slide up and down inside the plastic, making the "calibration" a complete joke.  I have since bought the OTC tester, which is made more like an actual spark plug, and immune to this problem.	-1
I'm very disappointed in this product. I purchased it so I could have an accurate chuck/gauge to use on all my tires. Unfortunately it isn't as accurate as the claims. I could accept a pound or two discrepancy, but this gauge is off by as much as 10 pounds and that varies from tire to tire. I thought spending more money would mean better quality, but I was mistaken. I do not recommend this product and wish I hadn't purchased it.	-1
NOT MADE IN USA  AS IN PICTURE!!  Over priced for a cheap China made tool . Save your time and money. Beware!!!!!!!!!!! Returned Without a problem . Amazon was quick and fair. But they need to remove the false pictures and clearly tell you this is made in China. After returning I ordered another OTC 7249 kit from other vender that was made in USA - A1  Quality.	-1
Bah.  Received different item than shown, never worked right, returned.	-1
Other reviewers had mentioned that the picture showed a different part. If you go to the GearWrench site and look up the part number, it shows the old model 2756D with the ceramic body. I contacted the manufacturer about this. About Nov 2010 KD Tools changed the design to the plastic POS shown on the Amazon site. KD Tools failed to update their own site to reflect this, adding to the confusion. Avoid this new KD Tools 2756D and get the ceramic bodied OTC 6589 (based on the original KD Tools design).	-1
I've yet to find a spark plug that isn't to recessed for this to get behind	-1
Purchased the OTC ball joint for upcoming ball joint jobs.  The first unit arrived with a thread so badly damaged that it stopped about 40% of the way into the press.  The damage was from the factory and was from mishandling of the part.  The plastic mesh covering the threads was not damaged or showed evidence of being in place when the damaged occurred.  The free replacement part which was quickly shipped, arrived with debris down in the bottom of the threads.  Some of it looked like a fine thread possibly fiberglass, and there were also some what appeared to be a fine metal particulate.  This was on the surface of the coating and was removed with a fine brass brush.  After cleaning the threads and lubricating it well, found that there are several tight spots on the rod as you thread it in.  The condition of the threaded rods does not speak well of the manufacturing process at whatever supplier OTC has making that part.  OTC maybe ought to inspect the overall quality of what its Chinese supplier is providing them.	-1
The markings are not evenly spaced at all. Just renders this useless.	-1
With small pressure the tip get separate from rulers. The pocket clips need a two hand operation to put'm on.	-1
I couldn't use it-- Not enough room on the rear 3 cylinders of a V-6. No room---	-1
i broke this when i tried  use	-1
returned product	-1
Pure garbage. Ban this item.	-1
Use channel locks, pump pliers, dogs, slip joint pliers.  Whatever you like to call them to take these out, works better than this tool.	-1
Quality looks decent enough. I only used this tool once and a puller arm broke at the threaded section. OTC warranty period is 1 year, so i was SOL on the return. The cost of the replacement part I need is almost as much as the complete set from Amazon. I have a few OTC tools and always liked them, but this one has me a little sour.	-1
low quality, the handle broke off as soon as i took it out of the package. In the future I will not buy low quality tools. It is not worth the frustration.	-1
It broke coming out of the package... It looks like it was defective when it went in.	-1
I don't really "hate" this but it does not fit at all. Is absolutely not compatible with my '00 TJ's OPS which is 1-1/16". For the record I put a 1-1/16" socket over it at home and that fit perfectly, only problem was it was not a deep socket. It was for reference though, a real 1-1/16" socket fits and this didn't. Go with a deep socket to be sure.	-1
spins in the handle. junk.	-1
I bought this to remove the plug boots on my 2000 GMC Sierra.  It worked on a couple of them then it decided to break off right where it goes into the handle.  I ended up using needle nose pliers to get the rest of the boots off.	-1
If I could give this tool zero stars, I would.  The tool broke on me, the handle spun on me and the actual tool came off the handle itself!  I filled the cavity (where the metal hook part goes into the handle) with epoxy and placed the metal hook back in hoping it will be repaired.  We'll see how long this lasts.  Luckily I have the Lisle 52990 Spark Plug Pliers to remove the plug wires in a T100 that I am working on.	-1
Tool seemed fairly well made, nothing fancy though. Unfortunately I bought this for removing the plastic rivets from my Polaris quad and they were of no use. Might be good for car fenders though.	-1
I called OTC and they sell a new version of this tool, same model. If you do a google search many stores will show the new picture. It is based on the Ford tool 303-567. According to them, all new sales should be the new version. It is uncertain if Amazon has old stock.  The new tool bends at 90 degrees instead of being straight, and has a raised area where the socket is placed (instead of being flat). There is much cam cap interference and it adds tons of frustration to an already difficult job. The tool may not even work when centered on the cam, you may have to offset it a bit to account for the obnoxious raised area.  You must use this new tool with a long horizontal 3/8 extension or the socket head will lock onto the cam cap. This is what happened with my 95 4.6L engine. It is less of an issue with the 32V engine but its still very awkward. I don't know about later years, but it is suggested for all modular engines. The tool got two stars because it works great on the center valves where there is no cam retainer.  These tools are designed by Ford. I don't know why they would change a good design into something that is practically unusable.	-1
dint work for me as described but it works well as a belt puller	-1
Hooked the tool around the base of the wire and gave a light pull and the tool broke in two. Fortunately I had also ordered the Lisle spark plug wire puller pliers to fall back on. Pass on this tool and just get the pliers.	-1
Does not fit on Chevy Vortec 5.3L / GM thick boots with the steel sleeve around it. This more for like the old style cables. The tool is good but not for this cables	-1
While using this for the first time on my Durango to remove the spark plug wires the handle pulled off. Not very well made for a Lisle product. I would have returned it, but shipping would have cost as much as the tool. Would not recommend, find an alternative.	-1
it doesn't do what its says it does its not a good tool to buy	-1
Well I was using this for the first time yesterday extracting the plastic neck of a transmission filter from its rubber seat and it broke where the shaft meets the handle. Now it's loose there and I don't know whether it will break off. So, since I bought it back in July and can't return it, I'll try epoxy glue before using it again. It might be okay just for pulling spark plug boots; but, if you use it for anything else better not put sideways force on it.	-1
Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.	-1
Didn't work well for me.	-1
Tried on multiple seals while rebuilding gm differentials - didn't work once - ripped into and tore apart seal and I eventually had to remove them the way I always have - with a hammer and flat screw driver to bend in the seal before removing it - too bad as I had visions of a better way	-1
complete and total junk - I never saw a socket cut so bad - look at the picture I guess Lislecorp is just a reseller for more Chinese garbage :(	-1
didn't fit	-1
Not a huge fan of this puller.  The rubber grip on the handle will pull off before any seals come loose.	-1
After sanding and grinding to fit properly, the follower had no place to go. Save your money and buy a nice set of screw drivers and pop the follower out when cam lobe is positioned on heal.	-1
It's an OK gauge.  Not terribly accurate.  When I zeroed the gauge the zero-mark was at least 2/32nds off, making it very hard to make an accurate read. As others have indicated, it arrives pretty well greased up, but nothing that a quick wipe with a towel can't fix.	-1
Zero is off so other readings are also incorrect. If it would be used a lot numbers would wear off and would be  hard to read.	-1
too shiney for  use in my well lit shop==hard to see numbers--think I will be buying a digital display gauge-- gauge was not accurate and could not calibrate like other gauges I have owned with all my years in the automotive trade, my eyes are a better depth gauge	-1
The tip fell out of the gauge the first time I held it up. Junk.	-1
The tread depth when zeroed or leveled has a 1/32 error and this maybe is tolerable for instances when tread is deep. However the critical point comes when tread is at 4/32 or less and this is about 25 to a 50% error.	-1
Broke on the first fastener.	-1
Pretty useless while trying them on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500.  Waste of money.  I ended up making my own by using a grind stone to shape some plastic tubing I had laying around.	-1
broke when i first used it	-1
Mine leaked air at the coupling.	-1
Guess I was the unfortunate one...somebody's gotta be I guess.  This product has great reviews,  didn't see a single review where one was broke on arrival but mine was.  The measuring pin was separated,  guess it was NVR connected right,  I requested a refund.  I might buy another when I send this back,  its just such a hassle to send stuff back when it arrives broken.  I hate going to ups and printing the labels and all that madness.	-1
a little flimsy have to real work it to get line to  break free ended up breaking  line and getting it out later plus all the rust didn't help once new fuel pump was installed tried to remove line off new pump and still had problems	-1
Does not work with my 02 civic. But may work with your car.	-1
Poor design , small center bolt , Lisle should be embarassed to put their name on such a poor product.	-1
I decided I needed a new seal puller and picked this up cheap here on Amazon. I tried to pull two seals with it today and it just tore through them like a can opener. It would have been easier to use a hammer and a chisel.	-1
cheap and flimsy. 2 liter bottle caps are 100x strong than these.	-1
Complete garbage, didn't fit sensor on car and didn't fit new sensor. Size was right but finishing was so bad it wouldn't work. Spent 20 minutes trying to file it to get it work before throwing it in the trash and going to auto parts store for a replacement.  The lack of QC from the company that manufactured this is appalling. I can't believe Amazon allows this vendor to sell on their site.  Do yourself a favor and buy a 27 mm socket from a reputable seller.	-1
I bought this to remove the fuel line off my 2004 GTO and it couldn't do it. I know I was doing it right. this just couldn't do it. take it for it is.	-1
Bought this to remove an inner tie rod on my wife's vehicle because it included the 1 1/2" adapter I needed. Unfortunately the fit was so sloppy and my tie rod was so tight that this tool just slipped whenever I exerted enough force to loosen the tie rod. This tool was useless to me.	-1
Horrible quality i don't know if i got a defective one or they are all like that but the sending unit didi not fit the edges are not right and looks more round that it should be. I ended up buying the a $5 socket from harbor freight same size 1 1/16 and its way better quality i put up pictures so you can c yourself the one on the right is the 5 dollar one	-1
Was bought for my 94 f150 2wd 5.0 xlt.  Shipping was 3 days (3-5 day free shipping). Packaging was good and no damage. Would NOT recommend OR buy again. was very cheap and broke after 1 fuel line. Had to go back out and buy i different finger tab set at part store and the scissors. The scissors can be very frustrating but worked for me in the end. Gave it 2 stars because it did disconnect one line and if that's all you need and you don't ever need it again, go for it.	-1
Although the socket walls measure 1 1/16", the inside corners of the socket are rounded, and would not allow the socket to clearance a oil pressure switch on a 2002 Jeep Liberty. Thankful for Amazons no hassle return policy. Unfortunately, I have a part in my hand, an the incompatible socket.	-1
It worked on one ACDelco GM sending unit, but stripped out on the second and was useless on the third.  Don't buy one if you plan to use it more than one time.  The little square contact points inside the socket strip out after more than one use, then it's a major pain to get off of the sensor when it strips.  I've been an ASE master mechanic for 16 years so it's not like I didn't know how to use it correctly.  Lisle used to be the way to go for funky specialty sockets like this, but it looks like quality is no longer a concern of theirs.	-1
The range of accuracy is 2-4psi which can be very annoying when setting a tpms light. Mine might be defective, but I would suggest looking other places. This could be a great product if it was a little more accurate. Oh, also the handle to press on to inflate is not the most sturdy feeling. It doesn't glide right when pressing.	-1
cheaply made.	-1
Used this tool to remove my fuel line on a fuel filter change...OMG I was under the truck for over a hour wrestling with it! Eventually the tool broke! What a piece of junk! I ordered the metal sissor one off of Amazon, got the fuel line off in 2 minutes!!! LITERALLY! I heard the click, and the fuel filter just came out! Save yourself some time and aggrevation...if you have a Ford truck, get the sissor tool, not this plastic junk.	-1
POS. socket is stamped 1 1/16 will not fit the sensor. My 1 1/16  short socket fit the sensor perfectly. Lisle quality down the drain.	-1
This product barely did the job. I would not buy it again.	-1
Well, this might be, but it won't be for long. Plastic is WAY too soft, and will not release springs in couplings.. Kinda defeats the purpose of the purchase, if you ask me...  Get some kind of metal/aluminum disconnects. This isn't it.	-1
Feels cheap and for five dollars more, home depot sells a digital one.	-1
Didnt help	-1
Did not fit the sending unit I was trying to replace. It was a little bit too small. I had to go to a local shop to get one that actually fit, even though they were both labeled as the same size.	-1
I got this to try to change out a fuel filter on a 03 F150.  It's very nice that it has a bunch of different sizes, but there's nothing to grab onto.  Once you slip it over the fuel line there's only the little larger piece of plastic to grab, and I was not about to generate enough force to pop off the back fuel line.  I also found that the harder I pushed the more the tool sort of opened up.  If you could get your fingers directly behind the wide end of this tool you could really generate a lot of force and probably pop the fuel line off easily.  The way it's set up, though, you can't.  While it's more expensive, I think the larger aluminum one-size tools seem like the way to go.  There you actually have something to hold onto.  I should add, though, that I have a feeling my fuel line is a bit rusted / gummed up and so perhaps under normal conditions this tool might work without a huge amount of effort.  Pushing as hard as I could, though, I was not able to get the fuel line off with this tool.	-1
not well made at all. The first time I used it the tool bent. I was pulling push-type plastic fasteners out off a trunk molding. Bought a snap-on brand  plastic fastener remover and have had no problems with it after several uses.	-1
Doesn't fit Dodge or Jeep vehicles with the 27mm switch. I don't know why amazon would advertise buying them both together when it is too small?	-1
Did not fit the pressure sensor for my 2002 Jeep Wrangler.	-1
Doesnt fit the Jeep pressure at all.  The socket is a millimeter too small.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C7ZTTS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01 is the sender and they even list this as the socket for it.  Now Im  not sure what to do.	-1
not very usefull	-1
Comes apart easily.  The little pin comes out easily and is hard to find.  If you are careful enough, it works, but there must be better gauges.	-1
This unit arrived with a lead health warning.  If this would have been listed I would have purchased something different.	-1
These will slip off and damage the clamp as well as skin your knuckles. Maybe if you were in a place with good access to the clamp it would work. I was despirate when I bought these and just wasted money	-1
Handle broke.	-1
I bought this item based on the reputation of Milton products , I am disappointed , this item is hard to read. the shaft if shiny and the numbers are hard to read they should paint the shaft a different color. I bought a different gauge from Wal-Mart for 2 dollars and it is easy to read.	-1
I bought this first thinking it would be a good buy.  I left it in my glove box, only to find it one day, bent.  Did not last long in storage.  I then I bought the digital tire pressure and tread depth combo.  Way better product.  Look up - Accutire MS-48B Digital Combination Tire Thread Depth Gauge and Tire Pressure Gauge	-1
This one leaked air at the swivel fitting..	-1
I can hardly read the depth indicators. They may have run out of ink when making these, I don't know, but it's almost unusable. The indicators are silver over the silver tube - almost all of the black ink lines and writings are faded.  Don't they check them prior to shipping? Thinking about returning it.	-1
meh...  i think a screwdriver and a pair of dikes work better.  I think I will be returning.	-1
doesn't pop up clips.	-1
Does not remove the plastic rivets i bought it for. It's way to thick.	-1
I wouldn't buy any more of these. It's hit and miss when it comes to putting sockets in them. Not all of them fit in order, and the holder takes up lots of space in a tool drawer.	-1
Great idea but not durable.	-1
I really like the look of this on the website but upon receiving it I have found that the sockets just fall back out the magnet is not strong enough. Standard sockets hold well from 3/8 of 2 inch and 1/8 but deepwells fall right back out just by picking it up. What good is a socket holder if it does not hold the sockets.	-1
Broke every single fastner when trying to remove	-1
Could not get it to do a straight pull on my 5 lug Jeep Liberty hub. Probably needed the extra leg. Took it to local shop and they did it in about an hour for $130. Wasted my money on this. It is a very solid heavy duty tool.	-1
Shattered after a few months of use. I keep it in my toolbox drawer just to organize my sockets - I don't tote it around for every job. It shattered one day while removing a 10mm socket. I suspect it's because the plastic does not hold up to chemicals like brake fluid that you may get on your sockets during normal use.	-1
You most likely buy this tool to help remove panels/trim inside your car in a safe way without scratching your car or damaging the trim. On top of that you want a sturdy tool that unlike the plastic counterparts offered here in a set of three break on second or third use and bend too much.  Well... The positive:  The tool is sturdy enough to accompagny you for most of your DIY life in the garage  The negative: The front end of the tool is fairly sharp. They could have easily done a much better job getting the edges more round so you would not scratch your car when performing work.  Bottom line; I still recommend this as the options (like good tools from HAZET) are at least 4 times the price. Just be careful using it.	-1
Cheap and bent on plastic fastener removal. Bent back pretty easily but still this is not the highest quality tool.	-1
Came with an M10 tap instead of the M8.  Luckily, I didn't need the tap out of this.	-1
Broke first time used. Used one time, first the tool leaked air when it wasn't attached to an air line (just to check the air in a tire without any air). Then when I tried to put air in a tire the end leaked so badly it was unusable. Also the gauge read 110 psi when it wasn't even on a valve stem. Poor quality, expected much better from US made Milton. Had to go to Sears for one, last place I wanted to go.	-1
So much for thinking I'd be able to see if my Spark Plugs are firing or not.  This thing burned out during its 1st Use !	-1
great  update....after minimal private  usage..it leaks....has a mickey mouse o-ring  in tip .....other than that it is a great unit...accurate gauge but mickey mouse seal renders it aggrevating at best to use	-1
I ordered this at first from amazon, `Fulfilled' by amazon (I will post this there too).  Pictured there is the K-D Tools brand tool, as well as here.  The tool from Amazon came from their KY warehouse.  When I got the tool, it was a Gearwrench brand tool.  Not the brand I hand ordered.  In fact, at this time, nowhere on amazon can you find the Gearwrench brand tool.  I searched.  So I sent back to Amazon for a replacement of the correct Brand.  Amazon was great in quickly resending my order.  But, once again, from their KY warehouse, I got another Gearwrench tool.  Not the pictured K-D Tool, and not the brand I ordered. So I returned to Amazon for a refund.  I found this one sold by Tool King via Amazon.  Again pictured it the K-D Tool Brand, with K-D Tool name on the Tool.  But just like Amazon KY warehouse, Tool King, from their CO warehouse, sent a Gearwrench brand tool.  Thought K-D Tools owns Gearwrench, and they are both good brands.  I feel the K-D tool is a grade better and I order a K-D tool brand and have yet to ever get one.  So just a heads up, YOU WILL NOT GET THE TOOL PICTURED OR THE BRAND LISTED.  IT WILL BE A GEARWRENCH BRAND TOOL AND NOT THE K-D TOOL LISTED AND PICTURED.	-1
I got two of these, neither of them worked on my 96 Jeep Cherokee despite the fact that it had no issues and just had an in depth tune up. Ended up getting my money back for them	-1
Does not work for either coil-on-plug spark detection, nor did it work for the plug wires on my lawnmower or motorcycle.	-1
Not the red one, You will get a silver one.	-1
Junk  Cannot see a spark anywhere on this	-1
DISAPPOINTED  won't work on coil ova plug type ignitions.	-1
Thank you.	-1
Poorly designed and barely works	-1
never used it , never worked from new	-1
thnx	-1
I wrote this review based on the lettering scratching/wearing off after a few uses...Primarily the number 30  Other than that, everything else seems to be working.	-1
Well built tool but had to modify /grind clearance to fit behind the inner joint. Could not get enough room to use slide hammer with enough force to do any good. Plus it is too thin to get a solid hit. Finally just grabbed the joint by hand and pulled it loose.	-1
Nice rig but it becomes unhappy and sticks if you use it in cold weather , below 40 sit seems to stick. So if it sticks your back to using it as a tire inflator and using your tire pressure guage again. The entire reason for this thing is to pump air in read it your done. Not the case. If it sticks not you have lost faith in it.	-1
This tool will kind of tell you if the wire is energized but only randomly. It seems to need to "charge" a bit before it flashes which makes it useless if you are trying to to test for an erratic idle as it too flashes erratically! Usually Lisle is top notch but not in the case of this mickey mouse device.	-1
It barely worked.  Finding the sweet spot on any wire for this thing to work was difficult.  Even testing it on coils that I knew were perfectly good, I could only get it to light up occasionally.	-1
At first I love this, but the handle lever froze up after one winter in a covered dry area of my shop.  I bought this because I wanted quality and not the cheap gauges but was disappointed with this durability.	-1
I just don't feel like you can grab the boot tight enough to pull it off. I ve tried it on different model cars still same issue doesn't grab the boot hard enough.	-1
I bought this to remove a really stuck plug boot.  The plastic handle grips keep pulling off the tool.  Save your money and buy something of better quality.  This is junk.	-1
The pressure gauge only worked once. I really liked the weight and how solid it felt but I can get an inflator for a lot less. I was tempted to order the 501 model but once bitten twice shy. Sure appreciate Amazon and their ease of return policy.	-1
Would not work on 2012 GMC w/ 6.2 engine.  Not enough clearance between oil filter and cast oil pan.  Returned due to this issue.	-1
The item came in very filthy, looks like from vacuum dirt. Very disappointed. I haven't tried it yet hope it works.	-1
doesn't hold up under prolonged use	-1
I was wanting the actual item being shown in the picture, instead I received a plastic cheap looking tool. If I knew this was what i was going to get would have never ordered this tool.	-1
This tool is about worthless. Use your money to buy a real wire terminal tool! I had better luck with a paper clip	-1
Slips and spins on my filters.  Not worth the $$$$	-1
This only works on small diameter filters.  There is another identical looking tool for normal size filters.  Do not assume (like I did) that an oil filter removal tool fits all common sizes.  Read the diameter numbers in the product description which to be fair are there in plain sight--but what is missing is that there is more than one size tool and this tool only works on (what to me are) tiny filters and not normal or common sizes.	-1
the spring easily falls off	-1
junk, not worth the money, much better units for a couple dollars more.	-1
Difficult to get it to grip the oil filter.  Had to hold it on the filter, which caused me to burn my hand.  I'd rather use a cap wrench but filters being different from one brand to the next it's hard to find a cap wrench that will fit.	-1
After doing some research I was hoping this would work on OMC OI outboard ignition systems. My specific motor is a 150 hp Johnson 1997. It may work on other types of outboard ignitions, but not this one.	-1
Not very good Spring affair is terrible Socket adapter is thin Works on end of oil filter were its the weakest - if you need to remove a real tight oil filter then you want to be as close to the base as possible It works - but theirs much better	-1
Used it on my chainsaw and could not get it to work...it may work on other equipment but will have to wait and see.	-1
horrid the spring came loose and doesn't work well anymore	-1
I find this to be very cumbersome to use. I had clearance issues on the sides as well as difficulty getting a wrench on it. I used this on a Subaru Outback 3.6R and would NOT recommend it for that application. If you have plenty of access than this work find but in general I would look for a better solution. I ended up getting some filter pliers that were perfect for the job.	-1
not for 4runner v8 its too short	-1
Junk	-1
It did not work at all for me. I wish I had not purchased. Maybe mine was defective, but, the springs are weak and it does not grip the filter at all. I would not recommend this product.	-1
Not sure why this has good reviews from others.  First, it only works on spark plugs that have the screw on tip, which many motors do not.  Even worse, the cable does not stay on the tester.  Tried both ends of both cable and tester and they only attached loosely and would fall off when trying to test something.	-1
I used this on a 2001 Toyota Echo. It kept slipping even though the design looks very well. Scratched my knuckle pretty bad taking some skin off. Had to go back to the old pliers sad!  Feels like it's well-made but does not seem to work for the vertical hanging Toyota oil filters	-1
Doesn't work very well at all.  No grip or complete lack of claws that can clamp on filter.	-1
I don't like this product at all,  very hard to use. If I had a choice, I would give it no star . waste of money.  I don't recommend it.	-1
needed something with being universal	-1
Garbage. It slips.	-1
I would not buy this product again. it did not identify a coil that had low output. Much better product is one in which you actually adjust the air gap to see where the spark no longer jumps across. it takes 10,000 volts to jump 1 cm. Most high out put ignition systems should be able to out put about 20 to 40,000 volts and be able to jump 2 to 4 cm with a strong coil.	-1
This oil filter tool is a little too large to fit Honda Filters. You need a 2 3/8 in. max. size to fit Honda filters.	-1
This would not work on the oil filter on my '03 Nissan Frontier. The reason for the 1 star is because my '97 Honda Prelude, '10 Honda Accord, and '15 Acura TLX use the same exact filter. The specific filter I am talking about is the Mobil M1-110 oil filter. I can however use it for the 1 Ford that I have since it uses a larger filter. I purchased a Fram FM101 oil filter cap wrench from Wally World for $3.37 and it fits the Mobil M1-110 filter perfectly. It also fits the Royal Purple 10-2867 filter very well, it is slightly loose compared to the M-110 but it has not been an issue.	-1
Spring was broken. Junk.	-1
The pump in theory suppose to suck oil out of the dipstick hole. It did not do it for Honda engine. It did for snowblower. You will need to get dirty to change your own oil.	-1
Maybe I'm crazy, but I've found that I need to squeeze the two arches together to loosen the oil filter for my Honda Civic.  I checked the size of the Honda filters and it fits the size range described (granted it's at the lowest end of the size range).  It does work, it's just that I need to squeeze it to allow it to "bite" on the oil filter.  The tool itself is of high quality, and I'm sure if I had a larger filter it would work great, it's not working too well for my cars.	-1
Did not fit the oil filter on my mercruiser.	-1
didnt work well and only loosens the filter	-1
THIS POS DOES NOT WORK ON SMALLER FILTERS--AS IN LATE MODEL HONDA CRVS AND NISSAN ROGUES. Very deceptive since their description (even on the package) says it will work on 2 1/2" filters. BUYER BEWARE. Worthless for most late model foreign cars.	-1
I pumped it thirty times and it still would not evacuate the oil out of my engine.  Waste of money.  Garbage.	-1
not working	-1
This is annoyingly undependable and misleading. Get the OTC 6589 instead. Its results are much more correlated with reality.	-1
Okay!  Removes your old oil filter but can't be used to install the new one?!?  Crazy. Waste of money. Should have bought the regular looking calipers. Oh well. Lesson learnt.	-1
Was working great when I got it in January of 2017. Since then I have used it three times. Now on my fourth try, doing an oil change; I extracted the oil out of the car, which it did great. Then I notice that at the base, where the black base meets the white plastic reservoir that holds the fluid, it was leaking. Slow leak all over the base which got on the floor. I emailed the company on 4/23/2017 and will updated if they respond.	-1
Did not work well at all. would not clamp on and stay! Don't but this one look elsewhere, useless to me!	-1
After this arrived, I checked for spark in a mower engine that was giving me trouble. It showed no spark. Several hours later after engine disassembly and magneto replacement it showed no spark. I was skeptical, so I hooked it up to my truck, and again no light. Anyway, the bulb inside is replaceable and must have been bad. The mower was fixed, but I lost confidence in this tool. There should be a check procedure for the bulb included with the instructions.	-1
Bought two different sizes of these, not pleased with the performance of the design. The 3 jaws work a lot better for me.	-1
Tool feels sturdy and like it would help, but ended up being a useless tool in the arsenal.  I wouldn't recommend this since you can hand tighten the oil filter if you used a textured one like the purolator.	-1
When I first got it, the wrench did work, however, it was never that easy to use due to needing to be flared out first to fit over the filter.  At some point, I lost the spring (not sure why it could even detatch) and then it was rendered completely useless.  Ended up buying a couple of the large socket looking ones that come in three sizes to fit common filters.  They're a bit cheaper, but I had to buy multiple so they end up costing more.  But, they also work, easily, every time.	-1
Purchased the item after reading so many good reviews. Ordered the item and received a totally different product than the one picture here. The items doesnt grab the filter head properly, already tried with my VT 600 oil filter and my RX 330 and nothing.  Dont waste your money. This one is going right back to amazon.  If I could give half a star I will do it	-1
The rubber boots are impossibly long.  I have never seen any application where you could make contact with the sparkplug top with insulating boots this long.  Obviously, making sure you have good contact when TESTING is critical.  I had to cut a halh inch of rubber off both boots.	-1
does not fit all coils... it's a weirdly designed unit. maybe for sure in specific application, i tried to make it on multiple cars with no luck. waste of money	-1
I tried this on a 2010 RAV4 filter cap. (this car has a cartridge filter) All this thing did was chew up the cap and did not get it open easily.  I was pretty useless reinstalling the cap and getting it to the correct torque.	-1
I bought this and had it stored until my car was ready for the oil change.  It turns out when I opened the new box that there was a mityvac 7300 inside.  This is not the 7201 and it's too late to get it returned.  OK I've been duped yet again.  I will no longer buy from AMAZON.  That's final.  unless this gets resolved.	-1
I wanted to like this product alot...but didn't.  First, after tightening the screws on top as indicated in instructions and installing the rubber stopper, I proceeded to empty the 7 Q oil resevoir for the hydraulic fluid on a ztr.  the mityvac leaked air the entire time, took an hour with near constant pumping.  I called mityvac tech service.  he said, 'yeah, that happens some times, where the lines aren't fully seated into the quick connections.  you can try and fix it or take it back to the retailer...nothing i can do."  nice guy, but not much resolution there.  I didn't feel like monkeying with it, as it was new and it had already pushed my patience.  It is also super messy.  oil everywhere from the hose.  the hose is super stiff, and I can see why, to allow for vacuum.  I called Amazon for a refund and as always they were  super awesome.  Try something else...or take a gamble...maybe yours will be a winner.  mine wasn't.  (I read other reviews like mine...and discounted them thinking I'd have better luck and bought anyway...  don't be me :)  )	-1
Piece of junk! You will pump till you think you will die!! I had enough after 10 minutes and finally put my car on my ramps and pulled the drain plug!!	-1
I should have returned this. It's no strobe light. The Inductive Timing light is so much easier, at least where you have battery power. Its made well but be sure to have the device fully inserted into the wires. Mine fell on the floor for not double checking the wire attachments and it could have damage it.	-1
I give a chance to the product since there was a lot of good review.  I did not consider the bad one and I should.  Some people complaint about missing part, it was my case to.  Moreover, the product leek badly.  I call the manufacturer and the decline to help me since I bought it from their authorise dealer.  I find unusual that a manufacturer is not behind is product.  The unit arrive in original well seal box.  I decide to purchase an item from another company	-1
Tool was damaged on arrival.  Plastic covering edge was cracked.	-1
A small curved pick outperformed this tool by far for my connectors.  The tabs seemed to big to be effective	-1
Tool is solidly built.  However I could not find a single connector on my RX 350 which it works on, and the only connector in my Altima which I found it to work on is the cable to the alternator, which in any case is easily removed with a screwdriver. Also the tool is too long, so it can only be used if you have direct line of sight access to the connector.  Most connectors are mounted on body panels or other parts of the engine, where a shorter tool would be needed.	-1
I've had one of these for quite some time. At first it worked fine and works great if the engine is warmed up before evacuating oil. One day when I was using it the entire cyllinder tank collapsed on itself so I assumed it was due to fatigue and hot oil making the plastic more pliable. It still worked after that but I had to make sure to go really slow and not pump it much which took longer but I had to watch to see if it was showing signs of collapse each time. Then my pump seemed to be very weak and did not pump much at all which required constant pumping to suck the oil out. Also,after the first couple uses, the drain plig rubber grommet was almost impossible to unplug and remove without using pry tools to get the plig to budge. The rubber plug became distorted from the oil and it swelled inside the hole. Finally I became so frustrated with it that I took all the hoses I could from it, filled it with water and used it for target practice. I bought a metal topsider and it seems to be doing much better than this plastic tank. If they built this same style pump but used a good pump, a strong, reinforced metal cyllinder tank with welded bands up the cyllinder in conjunction with a sight glass or some type of leak proof sight tube to check your evacuated oil level then it just might be the ticket. Nothing worse than getting a few uses of enjoyment from a product only to have it fail miserably down the line. I am a mobile mechanic and could benefit from the use of a good quality, Industrial grade manual oil evacuator. The top sider has been treating me fine for what it is.	-1
hardly fit to any connector	-1
It's not that good, it is very big, thick,long, very hard to use.	-1
It's a great looking tool , I tried it on (4) connectors on a 96 Eldorado and it didn't work on any of um...... Guess I'll have to buy a different car!	-1
Got this to replace my broken chain type exhaust cutter. This tool is very flimsey. You really have to take your time to make sure your cuts will be lined up even while your cutting & if your not careful you can easily make the pipe out of round. On the positive it gets the job done and its less tedious then using a handsaw, but the same if not better results can be had with a cutoff wheel. If you want a nice clean cut I strongly suggest paying the extra for a decent chain type exhaust cutter. This was on an aluminized steel piping, I seriously doubt it would cut through any kind of stainless steel. What can I say, you get what you pay for	-1
i've used mityvac products for years, including my first two fluid excavators and they lasted about 5 years . the last two items i bought were mv7400 and mv7201, the mv7400 did get a good bit of use but only lasted a little less than a year. the mv7201 i bought specifically for trans fluid filling on these newer vehicles and i promise we've only used it on 10-12 vehicles and it won't pump anymore yes it's leaking at sides of top, i haven't taken it apart and checked for o-ring. basically i don't have time to buy a new item then fix it where it will work i figured it would work when purchased, after my last three mityvac purchase and issues i'm gonna have to rethink whether i want to buy their products anymore or maybe it's time to look elsewhere there is other extractors and dispensors on the market. I don't mind paying for a quality product but thats not what i got last three times. Only reason i gave a one is because i can't go lower.	-1
Buy it only if you have one of those special cars that requires the fluid to be pumped out.  I bought this thinking it would be less work than driving up a ramp, taking off a skid plate, loosening a hard to reach drain plug and then waiting for the oil to drain.  While this does reduce that work, it creates more work on its own.  First, it leaks from all the fittings.  Sometimes the drain hose just slips out and then gets oil everywhere. Then even better, sometimes it just burps.  The allotted storage slots for the hoses do not work, the hoses pop out on their own, so you are suck trying to find a place to store hoses that drip.  Pumping is as much or more of a chore than taking off skid plates, it takes LOTS of pumping, even if you try to rely on gravity by placing the container lower than the car.  Emptying is a pain as well.  If you couldn't tell, I hate this thing.  It takes up lots of space in the garage, you come back and it has oozed oil out of lots of places, and then you wonder why you are using it in the first place.  I finally threw mine away.	-1
Tried it a couple times but the thickness of it on old, brittle plastic clips causes more damage than anticipated.	-1
Ok	-1
An incredibly poorly designed product.  First, the idea that it won't overfill itself is dead wrong, at least in my case. My previous review focused on that 'feature' of this device.  Now the plug in the top of the tank will not come out. I haven't used any 'exotic' chemicals in it, just standard motor oil, and the plug just seems to have swollen and will not budge.  Regarding the company, I have sent several emails and tried to call them, and gotten back NOTHING. No responses at all.  So far, this thing has saved me a lot of time, and some mess (before it overfilled) but I'm really afraid of the mess getting the damn plug out will cause.  If anyone at Mityvac ever reads these reviews, which I highly doubt, you really need to figure out what the heck is going on with the design of your product, the materials used for the plugs and seals, and why the overfill prevention doesn't work. Mine sits in the garage, half filled with oil I can't get out.  Would I recommend this? Heck no. Perhaps the later constructed ones have had some deign changes since mine was built, but if there haven't been any changes, I'd say look for something else, or possibly leave the plug out of the talk until you need to 'evacuate' some fluids, and watch it like a hawk when it looks like it's getting full before it makes a bigger mess than you would have had if you just changed the oil yourself and skipped the 'super sucker'.	-1
This tool is too long to be useful. Any where that you have room to use it, you can get the clips by hand. I bought it hoping to help out in hard to see or reach spots but its worthless.	-1
I bought this for the sole purpose of being able to pour motor oil in both my commercial mowers and my vehicles without using either a funnel, and also being able to solve certain measurement issues when using bulk oil. This product solves both of these problems. The see through property and graduations on the side help control oil amounts and the flexible spout allows for easy, drip-free application. The only thing I am going to do is color the measurements on the side with magic marker to make the easier to read. Other than that, it works great. One thing I would like to see the manufacturer do, is make some sort of cover and cap for it to help keep out dust and dirt between uses. UPDATE: 1/11/2011-Last month, the spout broke clean off where it attaches to the canister. The break was caused by the plastic breaking down. The unit was never abused or dropped. The fact that the plastic deteriorated in this short of time means the plastic used will not hold up over time.	-1
Pro: works if you are lucky. Con: many ways to kill and none available to fix. expensive if broken. many cheaper alternatives.  I used this to change my wife's oil (ML430) has an oil filter on top and you can feed this down the dip stick to suck out the oil. I also used this to suck out power steering fluid and tranny fluid in my truck. You MUST warm up your engine so the oil is thin enough for this to work. This IS big enough to suck up all the oil from the ML (which has 8.5 quarts). The problem is that if you do get all the oil into this thing, then HOW do you get it out if the oil has cooled? I'll tell you how. By putting too much pressure, you'll blow a seal and leak oil EVERYWHERE. It will stink up your garage, make a mess and it will do it when you aren't around. Do yourself a favor. Get a marine oil sucker (battery powered). I've used it to suck wife's oil straight from engine into an oil transport container, which I can dump directly into the recycling thing at the auto parts store. Not all this manual pumping garbage.	-1
Received the MityVac months ago and stored it in my garage. A couple of days ago I tried to use the unit on my VW Jetta. Set it up and tried to extract oil from my engine. It took a long time to extract the oil, two days, because the unit would not keep a vacuum in the main chamber. A day later I tried to find the source of the leak but couldn't find it. Put a vacuum gauge on the output and it would keep the vacuum for a couple of minutes and it went down very fast..  Called the MityVac company and discussed the problem with a service tech. He could not help me with the problem and did not know where the leak was located..  Would like to get the unit operating because it is so easy to use, but since it will not keep a vacuum I am worried that this will not happen..  Can you help Paul	-1
Missing parts	-1
This worked ok for a few months but the more I used it the harder it was to operate. Not sure why - ended up tossing it and making my own air vac setup.	-1
Line markings are not very accurate at all.	-1
Used it to change the oil on my BMW and Mazda SUV - both experiences resulted in an extraordinary amount of pumping... I am talking multiple hours here! Basically wore me out!  I tried tightening up the screws some around the lid but no improvement. I thought it was supposed to create a suction effect and clean out the (warm) oil with some alacrity - in calling the manufacturer they assured me it is designed to work on the gravity/siphon principle only, not suction.  This was not what I thought I was buying; probably my own fault but it now sits in its box in the garage - I can't be doing that kind of labor for an oil change... my time is worth more than that!	-1
Review is NOT about the product yet. Upon arrival the fastener that holds the pump to container was broken made it impossible to operate the pump. I'll update my review once I receive a replacement from Amazon	-1
didn't work worth the crap for oils and doesn't hold vacuum very long for sucking fluids.  wasted my money on this	-1
Overall can't comment on the functionality of the unit. But unfortunately as a Brand New In Box item it came without the 5 foot house, adapter et. Makes you worry about quality control. Dip stick accessory also missing.  Thankful for Amazons quick, easy and free return and exchange policy. Lets see how the next one goes.  Dr. Tasso Pappas	-1
I should have listened to the other reviews before wasting my money on this.  I bought it at the beginning of boating season to be sure I'd have it by the end (when the oil change is required).  Now it's been over the 30 day return policy so I have a worthless pile of junk here.  First, it wouldn't suck.  The top wasn't screwed on all the way (although the gasket was there).  I fixed that and pumped 10 times according to the instructions, and nothing.  I kept pumping and eventually the oil started coming in at a trickle.  Yes, the oil was hot from running the engine to operating temperature, the thing just wouldn't suck as it should.  Yes, I had the oil fill cap off as well (although it didn't make a difference).  Yes, the tube was all the way down into the dip stick hole and into the oil pan.  I ended up having to keep pumping the entire time in order to get out all the fluid.  The metal cylinder that you pump was actually leaking air at the top constantly, which obviously isn't right.  An hour and a half later when my oil was finally all out and my arms were tired, I tried using the pump to move it to container to take to the recycling center.  I ensured (again) that all connections were tight and the spout seal was in place.  After 3 pumps the spout lid shot off the top.  Luckily it was on a tether or serious injury could have happened.  I should have just thrown it in the trash and driven to a local store and bought something else, rather than wasting all my time.  The manual suggests using their web site to find service centers near me, but their web site only has a form for me to give them all my personal information and hope for a call back.	-1
Air was leaking from the top side cover in between the two screws where the suction tube outlet is located.  I have tightened tightened the screws/nut and it still leaks air unless i'm clamping on it with my two hands.  I tested it out on my brake master cylinder reservoir and it worked fine.  After pumping till my arms got tired, I only ended up with about a quart of used oil, which in fact was at operating temperature.  I'm sure if there was no leak, I wouldn't have had to pump as much.  I ended up just draining from the bottom, which was 100x easier.	-1
A great concept, but the container would not seal properly from its first use. A great deal of money gone to waste.	-1
This rack is built to hold 28 sockets. I filled it with 17, and placed it on the side of my Snap-On rollaround toolbox. I then tried to remove a socket and the whole holder fell off the box. The magnet is so weak that I doubt it could hold a full rack to the toolbox. Very disappointed. This is one of those tools that's been around for decades, and now they're skimping on the magnets. Again. Very disappointed. I just bought three of these (1/2, 3/8 and 1/4) and they're all going back in the box. More than disappointed. Disgusted.	-1
The design is too long to fit in a smaller tool box.  Every time I pull it out to get a socket, they all fall out.  They need to put a stronger magnet in this product.	-1
If it works, it works pretty good.  Chances are you will get one with a missing O ring though.  Several people on car forums I am a member of receive defective items including myself.  I called customer service after multiple emails went unanswered.  I told them I think it was missing an o ring because it would not hold a vaccum.  They said "yep it might be" and that was it, no "we will get one right out to you" or ship it back for an exchange.  They were very rude.  I just sealed it with some gasket maker and it works now but looks terrible.  I would go with a different unit with beter quality control.	-1
I bought this thing to use on my Mercedes a few months ago.  Last week I was going to test it for the first time but of course didn't which was a mistake.  Tried to use it and I can't get the pump handle to go all the way down.  The leaflet says to pump 10 times but with all 200 lbs of my weight on the handle I can't as there is a tremendous pressure felt.  The best I could get was maybe oil in the tube 10 inches above the oil pan.  I even bypassed the extract valve with tubing and could feel suction on tube going into the reservoir from the pump but nothing or very slight suction on the tube going into the oil pan.  Called technical support and about all they could tell me was how it was suppose to work and I would have to return it to the vendor. I'm glad I didn't pay full price.	-1
Not sure if this is the correct tool.  Tried to remove my Ford Escape radio with these and I still haven't been able to get it out of the dash.	-1
this product broke within 2 month of using it	-1
Awkward to use and did not work well on my cayenne. Sent back.	-1
Didn't fit on my 2005 Dodge 2500 front brake calipers.	-1
and double junk	-1
The actuation handle is flimsy. Not enough throw in the press. It bottoms out before the caliper is press back completely.	-1
Did not work as well as I expected the device would be good for a home mechanic....	-1
I bought this for Brimbo 4 piston calipers and it does work.  The issue I have is does not fit inside the caliper and the service book states do not separate the caliper.  So I just used a C clamp and the old pad to push both of the pistions back at the same time and that worked fine.  I hope I can return this.	-1
I bought this thinking I would have some type of warranty but it seems that I don't.  I have went past my window to return it.  I guess the thing to do is start buying from a tool truck again so at least I can return it without paying for shipping.	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS. This gap gauge is inaccurate and had cause me to gap an additional .07 mm that cause my engine to shake at speeds higher than 60 mph. I don't think it had caused harm to the engine but definitely not a pleasant riding experience.	-1
The gauge is not very accurate. I measured the one i received with two caliper measuring tools and the readings on this gauge is off by at least 0.13mm or 0.005 inches. Do not trust this gauge with pre-gapped plugs (as mine were). My denso PKJ20CR-L11 plugs are supposed to be pre gapped at 0.44 inches, but they read 0.38 inches.  The bigger problem is that the metal material isn't very tough. The first plug I gapped using this tool chipped a bit of metal off. See photo. I'm all for made in USA, which this tool claims to be, but the one I received was a waste of my money and time.	-1
A POS , plain and simple , like the product.	-1
Yes it works great but not worth the price	-1
The fine mist from the AIR-sol sprayer is nearly impossible to control even in a light draft and that deposits the product all over trim leaving nasty, hard to cleanup spots all over plastics and trim. It does however work amazing on my bathroom mirror.	-1
Opened the container and the contents inside were to dry to use. I tried rolling it with the roller but it was like oily black sand and gravel that would not coat properly, it was just to dry. Now I have a clumpy mess to clean up. Will try another brand next time.	-1
This product is only for show or hauling around groceries! One week after installation I loaded some bed rails and I have gouge marks down to the original paint! I didn't throw them in either. I have a 84 C10 I'm restoring and take great care with everything. Very disappointed... Spend the money on a professional job is you want to protect your bed!	-1
the kit only is for a 6 ft bed  description dosn't sayany thing about only for six ft bed have buy another quart what a rip off now have get a extra quart	-1
Product is excellent.  The problem is the one gallon kit says to get another quart if you have an eight foot bed on your truck.  Don't bother with the extra quart, it is not necessary.  I painted two coats with 3 quarts of gallon kit.  I'm sure there are different application rates but I found it would run or  drip excessively if the paint was put on too thickly.  My review is not on the quality of the product but critical of their advice to get another quart for an eight foot truck bed.  Now I have 2 quarts left over with nothing more to paint.	-1
Did not last, prepped as directed but my white bed paint shows through after a year.	-1
Already wearing off after about a month. Not very resilient.	-1
Junk, complete junk. Rolled it on, used two coats. Here I am a year later and the sun has completely destroyed the hurculiner coating and you can see strait through it to my trucks factory paint job. It doesn't even protect the truck from scratches from routine jobs. Just pay the extra money and have a place spray it on.	-1
I followed all instructions, allowed it to dry inmy shop for 30 hours after I was done with the final coat. Looked it over, looked amazing! Within a week of being outside the side that gets sun where I Park is faded, the other side looks glossy or semi gloss. That side looks bad like old flat rattle can.	-1
used this on my mower deck, didn't last very long, won't buy again. have better luck with spray	-1
This stuff is WAY too shiny. It looks terrible. I would stay away from this.	-1
I have used Dri wash for over 15 years.  Three purchases ago, I got a bottle that when let to set for several hours, would separate with a noticeable thick layer of water or what appeared to be water at the top.  In 15 years and probably 3 to 4 dozen purchases, that was the first time I had ever seen it separate like that.  Normally the classic would separate with a thin white layer at the bottom, then the greenish liquid in the middle and a small white sort of foam at the top.  No water ever above that, and it always worked very well.   I never had a problem with it until I ordered a bottle of classic and a bottle of Ion. Both had what looked like about a 1 inch layer of water at the top of the unopened bottle after sitting for several hours, I thought it was odd, but used it any way. It was terrible, Both the Classic and Ion were terrible, it did not clean well, didn't leave that super smooth feel on the finish of the cars.  Did not last past the first water wash. Water would not bead .  Just terrible.  I have ordered more, and gotten good stuff.  But this bottle I thought before I opened.  I shook it up and let it set for  the day. Sure enough, it separated with that tell tail 1 inch layer of water at the top.  I didn't even open it because I know it will be bad.  Take it from a person who has used a ton of this stuff over the years.  If you see a layer of water at the top, send it back do not open it, it will not work as desired.  Trust me on this.  I am attaching a photo of the bottle. You can see the murky layer of water above the white foam. Also I don't remember that layer of foam being that thick before either. Normally is it a layer about half that high. Just about the thickness of the layer of water that never use to be there.  I don't know what they did, or if this has been tampered with. I see no holes in the  metal cap seal but I do know its not right.  I will try to buy this again, but if I get one more of these POS bottles I am done with Dri Wash for good.  Its too expensive to  not work like it should.  10-16-16: UPDATE  I went against my own set of principals in that I did order another bottle of dri-wash.  After corresponding with the parent company about the product they swear that the formula has not changed and that I just need to continue to shake it up before I put it in the spray bottle.  Well thats not going to help but they are adamant in their story that they haven't changed anything. I won't argue with them any farther about that issue.  What I did do was this.  You may want to follow closely, and even then I am not 100% sure my conclusions or fix are totally adequate.  My conclusion is this: if the company didn't change the formula then they changed the quality of the ingredients they put in it. One of the chemicals, probably an emulsifier of some sort they started buying in china or some other place trying to reduce cost to increase profit.  Its a sad story we have all heard before.  At any rate I took my New bottle and shook it well then let it set for a minimum of 48 hours on my work bench. In a place I could access it without moving it too much so the layers would separate well.  I got an oral med dispenser from the local pharmacy, one that has the little tube to stick on the end.  Using it like a hypodermic needle I drew off all of the clear liquid that rises to the top.  From my bottle I was able to get about 3.5 ounces not quite 4.  It is not water, because it does not evaporate at the normal rate that water would, it seems more like a mineral oil or something similar. I won't go so far as to have it analyzed to find out what it is.  But I took as much off the top of the bottle as I could get. Shook it up again and did the same thing, I got slightly more but not much. I never did get it all, but got the top clear layer down to less than 1/8th inch.  Then after shaking well I used it on my truck normally, and it seemed to work a lot better, not as good as the old, but much better then when the clear liquid was left in the other bottles I used.  Whatever the oily fluid is that doesnt mix (well) is hindering the performance of the product My conclusion is that the product may not have changed formula but the quality of the ingredients has suffered, and do not mix properly thus causing the issues we have been seeing.  Again, this is only my opinion and somewhat knowledgeable observation.	-1
Update #1: Price flucuates from 60-95 so don't get taken. Update: #2 after 1 year the black is disappearing, not the rubber pieces but the color itself. Its almost all gone. The Color should last longer then less than 1 year. My other truck I did at the same time with Plastkote still looks new. I will use Plastikote from now on.  Use really good tape, I used blue painters tape and it bled through. Like others say read the directions. I had no issues with any rubber clumping. I Used a mud mixer and a cordless drill and no issues at all. Goes on really easy. Not only did i do the bed of the truck but I also did the wheel wells and almost the whole sides of the truck. Now time will tell if it holds up. At least I no longer have to worry about people keying it or door dings.	-1
Bottom Line:  If you take your time with prep work it will stand up to wear and tear, but nothing will make it stand up to UV.  Then:  I applied this to my truck about two years ago and was extremely happy with the results.  For preparation I took my time and used a wire wheel on a drill for the bulk of it, then cleaned it off with acetone.  For application I followed the instructions to the "t".  The results were fantastic, I would get questions and comments like "that looks great, where did you go to get it done?"  It was durable too, I could dump a load of gravel in my bed, then shovel it out with no chipping or flaking.  Now:  After a while I began to see the original paint color speckled through the liner, and the material turned from glossy black to flat gray black.  It still doesn't peel off, but the protection is lessoning and if you press your hand to the coated surface, when you pull it away you will have black dust residue on your hand.  All the symptoms are indicative of UV breakdown.  I would only recommend this to someone who has a tanneau cover.  I will be cleaning and coating over this with another product.	-1
Used this to compress the rings on a single cylinder motorcycle engine.  After sliding the cylinder over the piston top I tried to remove the ring compressor. After unscrewing it all the was I was unable to open it up so I could remove it and slide the cylinder the rest of the way down over the piston. Poorly designed...NO way to remove it once it has compressed the rings!!!	-1
The band is way to stiff and the collection band has too much slack and lets the ring band tilt causing damage to the rings.	-1
Shorted out. Did not want to bother returning it. Not worth it.	-1
Junk...  I used it twice- and now its broken.  Meter don't work anymore- and it melted a battery..  I couldn't return it because it sat in my garage Unopened for months before I used it so I assume the warranty passed.  And YES- I know how to use it..	-1
This thing is OK, but for the price, I didn't expect a piece of cheap plastic.  There are no instructions or even any assembly screws.  For $25, can I at least get a few screws to put the thing on???  There are nicer metal plate frames out there that I will probably look into now.  I would not recommend this one.  Also, it clips shut with four pretty cheap closures and I feel like at any moment it could pop open and my plate would come out.	-1
Rugged material, however does not stay open for loading.	-1
It's very flimsy, put something a little heavier in it, it collapse	-1
Far too flimsy. This thing feels like it needs to be packed to the gills in order to retain its rectangular shape. Would also appreciate some type of rubber/velcro grip on the bottom so it's not sliding around in my trunk when lightly loaded.  It does it's job, hence the no-return, but at the same time I didn't expect "soft sided" to mean "collapsable in all situations except fully loaded.	-1
I wish this had rigid dividers instead of just fabric. The unit is too floppy in general unless you load it up with a lot of stuff.  This is only a tiny but more useful than a standard duffel bag.  I would recommend you spend a bit more and get this one -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Snap-on-870116-21-Inch-Trunk-Organizer-and-Tool-Carrier/dp/B001EHEFTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Snap-on 870116 21-Inch Trunk Organizer and Tool Carrier</a>. I did and am much happier with it as it is ridid and seems to hold just about as much stuff.	-1
I have an organizer for my trunk and bought this one to give me more space options to put my stuff when grocery shopping.  This organizer is so "soft sided" that it's a pain in the neck trying to place stuff in it.  If you load it fully then I guess it works "okay"....but just "okay".  When you take anything out the sides collapse and the remainder of items in the organizer.....are no longer organized!!  It is so "soft sided" and made of such flimsy material that you cannot carry anything with a little weight to it into the house using the organizer.  Not a fan of this one....my other organizer is 100 times better!!	-1
The organizer is well made but unless it's filled with stuff, it'll collapse.  I ended up getting a cargo net that's working better for me.	-1
Came with a nice crack and hole in the bottle! Thanks for that.	-1
It would have been a five star review. But 409 works better, on cleaning up a bike. Mother just makes the part you use it on look wet, and leaves the dirt beneath. Four stars...	-1
Nowhere in the product description does it mention the hazing after a few minutes of spraying, unlike the regular detailer spray from Turtle Wax and Meguiar that I used before.  Not only is the spray hard to spread when wet, but after it's hazed and hardened it's a biotch to remove, needing a great deal of elbow stamina.  Not recommended. I'll go back to Mequiar.	-1
I really wasn't impressed with the overall result of this Polish, as part of the Mother's 3-step kit. I used all 3 steps, and still think I get better results from Tech Wax.	-1
I bought this product so that I could prevent the yellowing of headlights with its protector. But in fine print on the label are the words "Not a UV protector". I doubt it will prevent yellowing.	-1
This does NOT protect your lens against UV rays.....says so on the container.  (What else would you care about protecting it from that a liquid could handle?) I used 3M Headlight Restoration Kit Heavy Duty with Drill-Activated Sanding to restore my headlights; after a few days I noticed there were still a couple areas I didn't do as well as others........This product DID NOT do anything for those areas.	-1
Clay is useful but hate the fact you have to buy the entire package just to get the clay. Has California on it which explains why as if everything needs idiot proof. Maybe a few years from now it would be consider to cause cancer but only in the state of California.	-1
After using this product I found that Novus2 plastic polish worked better and was less expensive	-1
Did not notice any changes to my headlights. Time will tell if this is true waste of money	-1
Ive used this product in the past but this is the first time the trigger on the spray bottle arrived broken.  Needed the product and didn't have time to return.  Probably just a fluke.  Otherwise, great product that works well.	-1
Doesn't do much.	-1
Worked until the product dried, then appearance went back to gray.	-1
Worthless.  Did nothing to revitalize my black two year old vinyl.  Like wiping on dirty water.	-1
It says restores rubber to new finish but not as good as it claims.	-1
I tried this on my rear bumper with has a black rubber grip type strip and it didn't really do much to change the faded color.  And, it washed off, nearly completely, with the first rain.  It left water marks after the rain as well.	-1
My car does not have a lot of black plastic trim. It's a Cadillac CTS, and the only black areas are around the front and rear fascia, and the door pillars. But these black plastic parts had begun to fade after about 2 years. The car is garage kept most of the time. This product works - for about 2 days, or until car gets wet. Then things are 'back to gray.'	-1
I was very disappointed with this product. I cleaned my car, let it dry and I applied it just like it says too and I took my time (hours even) and made sure I buffed it dry with a towel numerous times. I even let it sit in the garage for over 24 hours and buffed it dry again just in case. It looked great in the garage and my favorite part was that it wasn't slippery like other products I have used in the past. The first day I left my car outside overnight the next day I already had drip marks everywhere and it was already starting to come off. After a week (I only drive this car once maybe twice a week) my black trim was already starting to look like what it did before I wasted my time with this product. I should really give it 1 star but i guess it looked nice in the garage when I first applied it and I loved the fact it wasn't slippery but the results went away far too quickly.  I have used black magic wet tire gel on black trim in the past and it works much better than this the only thing with that is it does make it very slippery and does drip some as well but not as bad as this stuff and it lasts much longer (good month or so not a day or week).	-1
I am only going to warn you of my experience with this product. I used the back to black mothers cleaner on a BMW E46 M3. Placed on the window trim that is a rubber like material. Probably rubber if I had to guess. So anyway, aside from only getting the wet black look for a short while it has also eaten through my trim and it will have to be replaced. No other parts on my car are damaged. Only the area where this was placed. I plan on filing a small claims case against mothers for the costs to get the trim replaced. This was used on the car maybe two years ago and I have not ever tried another product. Possibly the result of the sun, but again no other rubber pieces are destroyed. Only the area where this was placed. Maybe you will have better luck, but to me this is a product to be avoided.	-1
I have a bright yellow pick-up with lots and lots of black vinyl and rubber trim.  I just finished using Mothers Back to Black and am disappointed because of the unevenness of the black on the finished product, especially on the black bumper trim.  I have used several different products and my preference is Meguiar's M40 Vinyl & Rubber Cleaner & Conditioner.	-1
I wasn't impressed.	-1
Came in open the inside crack	-1
Saw the Mothers name and immediately thought quality and reputation. Even ordered two bottles. Upon arrival I used according to directions and was not impressed. Did not do what it said it would do. Would return, but not willing to spend the money for postage. Will just take this as a lesson that a name isn't everything. First time that a Mothers product didn't work for me. Oh well. Hope the Mothers folks read these reviews. Maybe they will change the formula for one that works.	-1
I purchased this product to renew the black trim on my pickup truck.  When first applied, it seems to be working but after applying and buffing as instructed, then letting it dry I noticed streaks on my trim work.  I priceeded to try it at another location, then another but all my attempts left the same ugly streaks.  The dulled flat black oxidized look return along with streaks from the Mothers Trim Care product.  I wouldn't recommed this to anyone.. It is a total waste..  you won't even get a minimal improvement.  Two Thumbs Down!	-1
I bought this product to use on my Yakima roofrack plastics which are badly sun faded. Didn't do a thing and they look the same as before. I wasted $10. Tried on my black car trims and barely makes a difference there. Not recommended by me.	-1
Does not "reverse" the effect of oxidation as claimed, only temporary.  Minimal effect on exterior black trims. Streaks BADLY after one rain. Not effective at all on dark blue interior plastic. Now I use it as a tire dressing. And it's at most mediocre at at.	-1
I bought this stuff and was pretty impressed with the results of it since I applied the stuff in the summer. But when it started to rain or if the car got wet, this stuff will come off and then in order to restore the look, you have to reapply it again. There is apparently better stuff but since I wasn't aware of it, I didn't know better and the geeks at the autostore recommended the stuff. I guess the stuff is ok if your car never gets wet and you don't mind having to reapply the stuff. I however don't want to have to reapply this stuff as there was a lot of labor involved in trying to improve the look of the trim pieces on the car.	-1
For years, I've used another company's trim detailer. But when that ran out, the only one I could find at the local auto store was Mother's Back to Black.  I use trim detailer on all sorts of trim types and vehicles, from cars to motorcycles, black plastic to flat grey painted metal, porous and non-porous.  For rubber materials, Back to Black works.  It doesnt have that silicone slipperyness when you're done applying it. However, I noticed that this product will not cover up rubber surfaces that have accidentally been touched by wax. The wax marks show through after a couple hours of drying.  For flat finish painted surfaces, this product doesnt work at all. Blotchy and inconsistent.  I'm sure this depends upon the condition of the surface you're treating, but the point of this product is to hide blemishes on surfaces that don't look so good anymore. As such, it doesnt work well for older vehicles that haven't been properly cared for.  Plastic surfaces seem to work 'OK', but the product washes off some plastics and on other plastics it doesnt seem to work at all (you can apply it, buff it, and it looks like it was never applied).  For ALL cases, the product doesn't last.  If you have a newer vehicle (<2 yrs) the condition of the surface is probably so good that this product's shortcomings are not visible.  But if you have a 5+ year old vehicle (or one that sees a lot of sunlight), then you'll be disappointed that all the time you spent detailing the rubber/plastic surfaces of your exterior is wasted.  To be fair, I'm comparing the performance of this Mother's product to the previous product I used which was made by the other 'M' company and is called "Trim Detailer" or "Gold Class Trim Detailer".  The other company's product works much better and lasts far longer than Back to Black.	-1
11 coats of wax on a new sonic in 2014. One winter. Several water spay-offs and now the paint won't even bead water. Poor product in my opinion.	-1
A clay bar is the standard way to remove bonded contaminants before compounding, polishing, or waxing a car. For the past several years I have used a variety of clay bar products to detail cars. Generally, the first time I clay a car, I expect the clay to get dirty very quickly ... it can be surprising how much material can get trapped in the paint.  I recently bought a car with badly oxidized single stage paint. My plan was to strip the car with dish detergent, clay it, and then begin paint correction using a fairly aggressive polishing compound. This clay was on sale, so I bought it. I'd assumed that I'd use the clay, get it completely full of crud, and toss it.  I washed the car and got to work with the clay. I quickly noticed that it wasn't picking up very much. That surprised me, so I grabbed one of my other clay bars and went back over the same area. This clay bar got dirty very quickly, picking up material that the Mothers clay left.  So, I'm not very impressed with his stuff. It's probably better than nothing, but not that much.	-1
Pretty poor kit. Clay was stiff and unusable. It appeared to have been on the shelf for years. I essentially paid a lot for a bottle of spray detailer.	-1
I wasn't very thrilled with this product.	-1
It sucks big time	-1
I used to like this product until I bought a new car with all black interior. It is a real pain to stop it from streaking and stop it from showing overspray as soon as I am in the sunlight. Light interior? Stuff works great because you cannot see the residue, but forget it if you have dark leather or vinyl. I repeat, mine is a brand new car, never treated before, factory fresh. I have a huge mess now.	-1
The bars are tiny, like real small.  Is clay that expensive??  Give me a break, it is just clay.	-1
Dulls the finish. I used this on the interior of my truck and it made it look dull and worse than before I applied it. I was surprised too because of all the positive reviews. Maybe I just got a bad bottle but I'm going back to Meguiars.	-1
It's stiff enough to use as an upholstery brush but the bristles come off while using. This does not make it a good brush for cleaning seats etc.	-1
This product did remove some scuffs and very superficial scratches, but anything more severe than that - it didn't do much to remove it.  It's not good.	-1
thats not worth Your money the scratches look worse after	-1
I've used this product twice already thinking I might have done something wrong the first time. And it's just not worthy of giving the results of what it claims to do Point Blank there's no other way to put it.	-1
did NOT work as advertised ,and followed the instructions an videos available to the "T".. waste of $$$	-1
very mild actually too mild little difference noticeable after use.	-1
Thin plastic bottle shatters when dropped. product is ok, Manufacturer makes these so when they drop the bottle cracks. Any squeeze bottle works better than these.	-1
I really wasn't impressed with the overall result of this Polish, as part of the Mother's 3-step kit. I used all 3 steps, and still think I get better results from Tech Wax.	-1
Horrible. Let the pros handle it! Save your !	-1
This clay is too soft and not aggressive enough. No comparison to clay magic. Used this on my hood for 10 mins and it still didn't feel smooth. Had an old bar of clay magic around. In just over a min the Hood was clean and smooth. SAVE your time and money and get some real clay!	-1
The detailer leaves a milky white residue.  I took extreme precaution with the clay using proper technique and it significantly marred my paint despite adequate lubrication and refolding.  The towel that comes with this is absolute junk.  You need to individually purchase each of these options and you will get better results and better products.	-1
It did not work for me. It create a water spot like white powder in the morning when there is a fog. It also do that when it rain. I will try turtle wax next time	-1
I bought this because of all the high reviews, but for the life of me I could not get this stuff to come off. I later bought some Rain Dance and got much better results. I gave the rest of this stuff to a friend that said he uses it all the time. Perhaps he'll have better luck than I did.	-1
I really wasn't impressed with the overall result of this Polish, as part of the Mother's 3-step kit. I used all 3 steps, and still think I get better results from Tech Wax.	-1
I used it on my hood.  Not impressed at all with the result.  Left more scratches than 18 years of sun, wear and tear ever did.	-1
Claybars are not very aggressive and seem to fall apart quickly. Instant detailer included tends to be streaky. Low quality microfiber.	-1
Didn't seem to do any good. Best bang for the buck came from compound and polish.	-1
I only received one 80 gram clay bar in package so some kits might not be as advertised on box.	-1
The clay is wayyy too soft to hold up to pressure needed to rub a vehicle down. I tried this for about 10 minutes and chucked it in the garbage, and went back to my old clay bar. I recommend Clay Magic. It's a much stiffer clay and you can use it like an eraser to remove tree sap, bug crud, and anything else that's foreign to your vehicle's surface. Clay Magic is the way to go.	-1
For the effort it takes to use this product your better off using Swirl remover. Swirl remover will do the same thing while cleaning, smoothing and polishing the surface preparing it for wax..	-1
Not what I had expected. Does do a good job for what it was designed.	-1
This kit seems like more of a hassle than it was worth. After using one clay bar, my car's finish was indeed smoother, but it looked exactly the same. A few little spots of sap came out here and there, but I honestly think the same thing could've been achieved with Goo Gone and Windex.	-1
I was not impressed with this kit. The clay is fantastic, but the detailed that is included just sucks.  First, I had to use an entire bottle to keep the clay lubricated around my entire small car. The ad clearly states that this bottle will last "many" cars. No. Not if you don't want clay residue on your car.  Next, after claying my car, the excess quick detailed dried. Oh no problem, instructions say you can clean with more detailer. WRONG. With tons of muscle and even more quick detailer, I was unable to clean the surface. I had to reach for my trusty 3M compound remover.	-1
Just got a car that the paint needed some TLC to bring it back to life. Having some Turtle Wax " liquid clay bar " i tried that on a fender and was amazed at what it did. I knew i did not have enought to do the whole car so i went looking online for more. What i found was the liquid clay bar was highly critisized and the "real" clay bar was deemed so much superior i went in that direction. When i got the " Mothers system " i was well prepared having watched online video's and reviews etc. Was i ever disapointed !! A complete PITA to work with a piece of silly putty in one hand while sraying detailer to lube it with the other and wiping it down with thier "special" cloth after.. Compared the area with the one i used the liquid clay on and what i did in one quarter the time looked much better than the solid clay bar area. I finished the car with the liquid clay bar. Having the kit with the included " carnuba" wash/wax i gave that a try.. supposed to be a wash and wax all in one. The car was clean after the liquid clay bar so i cant say how well the wash part of it worked but the wax part was non existant.. Used Mequires "gold class" liquid wax after and what a shine then !. I do like the microfiber towel they included  :) I may also have thought this a good product if i had not already used something far better and easier.	-1
I normally use a different clay bar (from "Uber"), and wanted to try a more easily attainable over-the-counter clay.  I gave this clay bar system a shot.  There are actually three products:  1. The clay itself. I found this clay to be very underwhelming because it is an extremely mild clay.  I was claying a friend's vehicle which has never been clayed before in 5 years, so I was expecting the clay to pick up quite a lot of contaminants, especially from the hood and trunk.  It definitely picked up some, but only amounted to about 50%, even after two passes.  The surface still didn't feel smooth.  I then went back to my usual clay bar, clayed the trunk and hood again.  Upon examining my clay bar, there was the other 50% that the Mothers clay didn't pick up.  Also, the Mothers clay is fairly sticky and soft.  If you have nitrile or latex gloves, be sure to wear them!  Even with gloves on, I found that the clay kept getting bigger and flatter simply from the light pressure of me claying.  It eventually gets so large and flat to the point it's clumsy to use, so I ended up prematurely re-folding the clay (which is particularly irritating since it hasn't picked up all that many contaminants to begin with!).  By itself, I would rate the clay bar 1 star.  2. The microfiber towel.  This is a decent microfiber cloth; nothing fancy.  Don't be mistaken that you can use this cloth by itself to wipe off all the detailing spray you use for an entire car.  You will need multiple microfiber towels.  The towel itself is pretty thin, and won't absorb much liquid.  One side has longer nap than the other.  It would probably be better for buffing polish or wax.  By itself, I would rate this microfiber towel 2 stars.  3. Showtime Instant Detailer.  I thought this was a decent product.  It has pretty good lubricity, so when claying, the clay glides effortlessly over the paint.  There's a pleasant smell which reminds me of lotion or soap.  My only gripe is that I ended up using the entire 16oz bottle on this one car.  As such, I don't think this is the most cost effective clay lube or quick detailer available.  By itself, I would rate this quick detailer 3 stars.	-1
I have been detailing cars and aircraft for forty years. I have tried almost every thing out there as far as waxes and cleaners go. I'm am a old school Simoniz guy. Yea, lots of work...but it works. I would always use a cleaner first, Dupont worked. I figured it might be time to try something new. So I tried the Mothers clay bar. Did not work well. I tried Meguires Clean and wax and that stuff is great. Tried Klasse, real good stuff. Micro fiber.. the more you spend, the better you get. The clay was a joke.	-1
One of these fuses didn't conduct out the box.  It was a frustrating day let me tell you.  Had been working hard for months putting my system together (one weekends when time was available).  Finally juiced it all up.  Only to find one of the amps wasn't working.  Even though I was so careful, I had to assume I did something wrong, so I checked all my power connections.  Only to find that the FUSE ITSELF was bad.  It hadn't blown.  The element was fine.  Literally the element wasn't connected to the endcap.  I had to check it several times, but that was definitely the problem.  Tossed in a new fuse, and all was great.  I'm sure it was just bad luck, but I felt the need to share this story.  Hopefully you get all four in proper working order!	-1
Sealed container had already hardened product.  I opened the tube, pierce the seal and then nothing came out. it was already hardened.  I don't know if this is old or if the manufacturer isn't sealing its tubes properly.  Just be ready to scramble  around locally to find gasket maker that you can use once you have you engine torn apart.	-1
There was already a hole in the tube when I opened it up. Was able to use it for what I needed, then promptly threw it away. It's a little annoying buying something new with a hole in it, oozing out black RTV everywhere..	-1
item was set before opening.  I had to cut the tube open to find some unset portion of the RTV.	-1
On too many occasions, as with this product, Permatex plastic caps will crack right across the middle where the cap transitions into its tube piercing stem. Now you cannot properly reseal the tube and so the product dries out and you have to buy more. No over-tightening required. I suspect it is a design feature to sell more product. It became so frustrating I contacted the manufacturer, they informed me they were well aware of the issue. They promised to send replacement products out and I stressed I only wanted a couple replacement caps, no free product. They indicated they would send them out and instead did nothing. 1-star for persistent manufacturer defect and customer service fail. In the future I will avoid Permatex products whenever possible.	-1
BOUGHT TWO TUBES, ONE WAS PLUGGED. REAL PAIN TO TRY TO GET OUT.	-1
The majority of the Time, this sealer doesnt work worth a damn. It claims OIL RESISTANCE, but that has Never been prooven to be True. Oil ALWAYS ruins the sealer, in some way or another.  And as far as SEALING goes; It really doesnt. Most of the Time, it always allows something to leak through.	-1
Dryer out before even opened	-1
Product arrived defective - top of tube had  already hardened. Should've gone to the store.	-1
Tube arrived with a broken cap. Throw it away, and buy some more. I have grown to hate Permatex, and prefer CRC, or almost any other company other than Permatex. Loctite is the only product I buy from Permatex now, and I am getting away from that too. ITW Permatex gasket makers, and Hylomar have been declining in quality steadily since the 1990s. Their Hylomar was separate and I would have oil and blue half cured gel. The same is true for the last batch of hi temp red RTV< and the last tube of black had a cracked cap. I started buying CRC lately and think it is a better product.	-1
The product is great based upon specifications.  However, the compound only reach to the top of blue label when I opened it.  It makes me wonder if 8 oz here means the bottle only, or the compound.  I guess the former is true.  I also have 8 oz regular anti-seize from 3M.  The compound really fill up all the way to the top.  I suggest that Permatex should make it clear that we are paying for 8 oz BOTTLE, not the compound.	-1
The bottle arrived in new looking condition. Inside, it was barely half full. I don't know where the rest is?? It seems to be genuine anti-seize.	-1
I read a review about the caps splitting and recalled that the exact same thing happened to me on a tube of Permatex black. I contacted the company twice but they would not respond. I have had mediocre results with most Permatex products over the last few years and have switched to other brands like L or V or 3 instead (Amazon does not allow competitors names). I think they have cheapened their products to make a quick profit.	-1
Subpar not as good as Meguiar's Gold Class Carnauba Plus Paste Car Wax	-1
I saw all the 5 star reviews and thought I would give this a try. I don't know if the wax I got was bad or what, but it is not even close to what I have read. 1. Very hard to apply  (by hand) 2. would not come off, streaked and smeared badly. 3 I have been doing my cars and others for over 30 years, this is one of the worst results I've ever had. I Ended up having to re-wax the whole car with my normal wax Meguires gold class carnuba. I'm not sure if all these rave reviews are doing it by hand or using a buffer, or as I said earlier got bad wax, I would not recommend this. The can also does not seal up good lid is very loose. Overall nothing good about this wax for the price, If You're Doing It By Hand, so I am sticking with my Meguires Gold Class.	-1
End result was decent, but not noticably better than most hard waxes. Applying this wax took 2X to 3X the normal time for most paste waxes; taking it off took 5X longer. It was so incredibly difficult to remove (I hand waxed my car), to the point I considered hoping over to my local hardware to to buy a DA power polisher to take off the remaining wax. Most of Mother's products are really good. Not sure what happened here. I ended up returning the product to AMZN.	-1
Wax was so thin that it ran out of the cans during transit and was unuseable when I received it.  Not a good product at all	-1
This is not pure carnauba wax. It contains petroleum distillates. Made what I needed this for take a lot longer. The distillates can be somewhat evaporated by letting it sit out uncovered, but it takes a very long time.	-1
wrong item	-1
Product dried up after first use despite being capped, rendering the rest of the tube useless.  Some air was leaking through the cap after using the cap to break the seal on the tube.  Manufacturer Permatex was unresponsive regarding the leaking cap.  I strongly recommend using a screwdriver or something else to break the seal on the tube, to minimize the chances of making a crack in the thin plastic cap.	-1
I am a mechanic and have purchased this item and many other similar types of permatex silicone tubes. The caps on each and every one of these items have invariably split before most the contents could be consumed leading to premature solidification of the remainder of the product. THIS LEADS ME TO STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT PERMATEX IS INTENTIONALLY DESIGNING THEIR CAPS TO FAIL IN ORDER TO BOOST PROFITS BY FORCING THEIR CUSTOMERS (YOU) TO REPEATEDLY BUY YET ANOTHER TUBE OF THEIR FAULTY PRODUCT.  This design flaw surely has lead to millions in additional profits for Permatex.  If you have fell victim of the Permatex faulty Caps I urge you to:  1. Keep all faulty caps (even if you have tried to repair it) 2. Keep your receipt of purchase 3. Submit a complaint to your States Attorney General (google; [your state] attorney general) 4.

I ordered this after reading about it. I used it in the valley corners and as the front and rear gasket sealer on a SBC engine instead of using the rubber gaskets in the kit, or the ultra black like I've used before. After this stuff leaked twice I used Ultra black like always and it sealed perfect. This stuff gets very soft and gummy when in contact with oil. Maybe I was using it wrong, maybe I'm a dope but it was a pain to clean off the engine. I don't think I'll have a use to try it on again.	-1
I bought this to fix some minor oil leaks and it just doesn't work that well. I used it to seal my Camshaft Endplate, Camshaft Sensor and High Pressure fuel pump. Well the Camshaft Sensor still leaks after letting it sit for over 24 hours. I now have to tear it apart again and use some higher quality stuff. I would of given it 1 star if it didn't work at all.	-1
too tight for my bumper.	-1
BACKGROUND:  I purchased a used travel trailer (2003 Surveyor SV210) and it was missing one of the caps/plugs on the rear bumper. This was a bit of a concern as the sewage hose and some related pieces are stored inside the rear bumper and I certainly didn't want to lose them while travelling. I measured up the bumper (4" !) and ordered two of these to keep both caps looking the same.  MY EXPERIENCE (UPDATED - July 5/11):  On a recent camping trip that took us down some rougher gravel roads, neither of these bumper caps managed to stay in place. Neither completely fell out but both were pretty close to being lost. I am now unsure as to whether or not I can trust these bumper caps and am considering replacing them with something that stays in place better. The funny thing is, they are a difficult to insert and seem very snug but once they start to vibrate they push themselves out.	-1
When I got it, it seemed to fit well in the bumper of my trailer.  But driving down the road I noticed something dangling out of the bumper, "It was the sewer hose!"  Of course it was embarrassing to stop and shove the hose back in, thank goodness I had my trusty duct tape to tame the snaky beast.  The bumper cap was long gone never to be seen by my eyes again.  I'm still looking for the perfect bumper cap that will not pop out just because the road is a little bumpy.  The quest goes on...	-1

These are overkill for most projects no where on the packaging do they state as to how many amps they are rated at! I had to go out to their site and find it myself ( no one picked up the phone!) . Btw they are rated at 85 amps! Yes they are convenient but for what you pay here you can go out to most web sites and get 20 diodes for your automotive needs! The self sticking tape is a nice feature and there are diagrams on the box and on the website plus they have a tech support line when you call ( as I said nobody answered when I called)! So I gave 2 stars just wish I would have never opened the package? Smh! Live and learn!	-1
The Old ones I have never use to do what this one does. Bought it to make a gasket around a heating oil pan patch. Every time I squeeze a new pin size hole appear. No biggie. I just taped it around and keep using. Then another hole appeared. Got it all over me. The floor, my jacket, all over the place because of the cheap tin foil they use	-1
Cap failed on second use of the item, leaving 95% of the tube's contents wasted. Not happy with quality control.	-1
From ad copy led to believe that this was metal. Only the mounting flange is metal. The coupler and check valve are all plastic. I don't believe it would stand up to much use and absolutely no abuse. Hasn't every one either stretched their municiple water hose tight or tripped on it etc. You would snap this off in a heart beat.  TH JR 160-85-a-26-A coupler is brass and will hold up. However if you abuse it you will probably break the plastic mounting flange. This is the lesser of two evils i am sure.	-1
don't waste your money on this	-1
Plastic hose fitting , which will fail early.	-1
It did seal my tractor hydraulic fittings although they need to be tight. package says takes 3 days to dry and it recommends you buy their primer also (about $10) but I didn't use it because I didn't read the package details close enough (we're talking very fine print) until I had the fittings off. It took 5-6 days to dry sitting in garage, temps got down to 30's some nights so may be faster if temps stay 60-70 min.	-1
You might think a PERMATEX product for use on auto engines would be resistant to gasoline, you would be mistaken, it looses all adhesive affect when exposed to gasoline	-1
used this as recommended.  Its not strong enough.  Gasket started leaking just as before.  Going to the "high tack" stuff.	-1
sent back didn't need it	-1

Needed for motorcycle project, and can is dry/dead out of the box.  No propelant or dried up and would not dispense.  Went to my local auto parts and picked up small squeeze tube to get the project finished.  Product works well (Permatex high-temp red rtv), but beware old stock of this product in pressurized can.	-1
Since I had used this same product several times before over the years, this time it seemed like the material was not very flowable... I believe this is a good brand and a great product which is why I purchased it...  I was a little disappointed this time for sure...	-1
JUNK! Did not fit properly and required modification. Still fell apart.	-1
I had wanted an ossilating fan for my shed for some time.  When I saw this item, I really didn't expect much...  Just a small ossilating fan.  I got the package very early.  Packing wasn't bad.  Immediately upon opening the box, I noticed how flimsy it was.  No big deal, it was cheap and intended for light use.  I installed it and went to turn it on.  The switch pushed inside the unit.  Frustrating, but these things happen.  I took off the back screw and looked.  The switch plate was screwed in, but the switch wasn't attached at all.  No glue or anything...  Not even any residue.  Upon examinaton, the switch that came with unit I received never would have worked. It didn't have anything that could have bridged the contacts.  Poor design, poor manufacturing.	-1
I have installed many solenoids and isolators and recently tried this one.  I installed this one and after 2 days of use the top of the unit (the small circular disc on the top) blew apart and the plunger popped up and grounded the battery against the housing - this started an electrical fire in my engine compartment, luckily I was able to get the fire out and pull the solenoid plunger out fast enough to prevent further damage.  This product is extremely unsafe and you risk starting a fire in your vehicle, which could lead to a forest fire, house fire or even death.  The problem is that the top of the unit is not crimped or welded on properly, which can cause the solenoid to pop up and fall back down grounding our power source.  I will be letting Amazon know that they are selling a dangerous product.  Of note, I am an experienced mechanic and showed this failure to two other mechanics - none of us have ever seen this happen to a solenoid before.  It is hard to imagine a product could be make with such low quality.	-1
Useless! I followed all instructions and STILL had to make modifications. Fell apart and dropped the antenna after a few months. AVOID!	-1
Way too coarse for modern precision engine valves. This might be okay for lapping the valves on a 1948 farm tractor, but totally too coarse a grit for my use on motorcycles valves. Literally felt like road gravel suspended in heavy oil.  They don't really give a grit specification on the package. I ended up finding a much better two-grit combo package (120 & 280) at the local auto parts store.	-1
The lug nut key requires a 13/16" socket or 21mm socket. if you have a honda/acura or any car that doesnt supply a 13/16" or 21mm wrench, you'll need to carry an extra socket and ratchet in addition to the wheel lock key in your car. Additionally, since you have tuner style lug nuts, that means you also have another special key lock for these nuts. So troublesome.	-1
The item was too small, outside of that it seemed to be a quality item.	-1
did not fit my lexus RX350 Sport although McGard clearly says it does.  Had to buy Toyota part to get the lock.	-1
Does not with,  used on a few minor marks and really put my elbow into it and nothing changed.  I was so hopeful but left with disappointment!	-1
Tried it on a 2015 Ford,which had a number of tiny,hair-thin scratches at door handle as well as below trunk. I rubbed with 100% cotton rag for several minutes, reapplied fresh solution, tried again. No improvement whatsoever, not even the extremely thin ends of the tiniest scratches were gone or reduced. Maybe this product works with some clear coats, but others might be too hard?	-1
This stuff has no cutting ability as far as I can tell. I've used a few times now on the tank of my motorcycle, and it seems to be a decent polish/wax, but doesn't take out any swirls or light scratches.	-1
The web site said this item would fit the year and model of my Toyota Camry so I ordered it and it arrived but it did not fit and I had to return it for a refund, as a mater of fact I ordered another similar item and it also said that it was the correct item for my car but I also had to return it!!! Bad news with the problem of returning both units!!!  I ended up ordering for the third time only this time I ordered the same unit that I had ordered for my other Toyota Camry!!!  All is fine now but what a hastle!!! I hope you review the site I Own A 2002 Toyota Camry SE !	-1
So so. Did not remove light scratch.	-1
Are you kidding me?  I can't believe any of these reviews and especially some of the before and after pictures.  I cannot get this stuff to get out the finest superficial scratches, even something as light as a swirl mark.  I've rubbed and buffed at every angle to some very light scratches around my 2003 Thunderbird.  The end result is the scratch is still there just like it was before I started rubbing and buffing.  Snake oil.	-1
Doesn't work very well. Maybe I need a buffing pad of some sort? I noticed no difference in the scuffs I attempted to fix.	-1
DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. I went into this hoping to just remove some hairline scratches and swirl marks, nothing intense or any deep scratch removal. Not only did this stuff barely remove any scratches, the product cakes hard onto your paint extremely fast before you can even wipe it off after you apply it, leaving it VERY hard to remove with a microfiber towel. You'll essentially create more scratches trying to remove the product, and then it sends tiny white flakes everywhere, where THOSE are even harder to remove. This stuff ruins your paint, please avoid this or buy a more professional scratch remover.	-1
Not effective on light scratches of my graphite gray trailhawk Jeep.	-1
Useless.  Works no better than regular compound.  Buy Meguiars compound which works the same for less money.  I have both.  Used both.  This product does nothing that compound does not do.  Silly to buy both which is what I did.  I love Meguiar products but this product is useless.	-1
Used this product on my new black Platinum f-150 and it seemed to make the area dull where used. Have tried several different waxes since installed to try and brighten the area but did not work. If you have a dark vehicle ... do not use this product!	-1
Didn't remove any light scratches	-1
Did not work	-1
Did not remove any scratches. Useless.	-1
Stuff just does not work for dark colors. If you have a dark color car, do not buy this stuff. I use meguiar's stuff for everything, and I enjoy using their products. This one simply does not work, and if it does it surely does not work on dark colors. I have three different scratches on my car, all different kinds of scratches. This did nothing, and I mean nothing. I followed the directions and put a good amount of elbow grease into the scratch. The product simply does not work for dark colors. It might work for a lighter color and I can see why that might be the case. However, I would not spend the money to buy this. Odds are it won't work.	-1
Doesn't do much	-1
Hard plastic. Not the quality i was expecting	-1
I just lost my money. Its a lie does not work . on TV looks good until you buy it. I call nevea or vicilin..	-1
Did not do as expected.	-1
Save time and money, saw this at Auto Zone for less money.	-1
fake	-1
So I had swirl like scratches on the back bumper from tapping some shrubbery.  Used a terry applicator and worked it into the affected areas.  Then buffed/wiped off with a microfiber cloth.  I even did a second application because I was not too happy with my first results.  In the end the product did not seemingly help the scratches.  If anything I feel like I glossed the section of the car.  But I persoanlly see the scratches just as much or near as much as they were before doing so.  What a major let down, I assumed from some pictures it would have done a little bit of better job, least to some areas of the scratch.  Oh and I found the product cheaper at target.  Like $8.48... not that I reccomend it : / #Shrug	-1
Fake product.  Label is not the same as the picture on ad.	-1
So this stuff is supposed to remove scratches?  Well, lets just say it doesn't.  I wouldn't waste your time.  Get a good rubbing compound, polish and wax.  I wouldn't ever buy this junk again.  If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.	-1
Did not work. Smeared  on area used.	-1
Permatex appeared to be used not new.. Lubricant bottle was filled with 3oz of lubricant. Not 8oz which I paid for...	-1
Picked up a bottle of this at a local auto parts store in hopes of removing some swirl marks and light scratches. After using a Porter Cable DA polisher and going at a 2 foot by 2 foot section for about 5 minutes, none of the swirl marks or scratches went away. Just skip this product and opt for a more expensive and higher end scratch removal system.	-1
I feel led astray.  This item, and it's yellow counterpart, are NOT soft.  They are hard plastic and after trying them for a short time they have been replaced. The ad description is misleading.  There is nothing "Rubber-like" about this item.  Now, after removing them, I have two holes in my wall that need to be repaired! If you want something soft to protect your car door look elsewhere.	-1
Didn't do much for me.  Looked the same before and after.  I had a scratch from a twist tie from when I got groceries out and from someone smacking my door with something.  Neither looked any different after applying.  Seems to fine as a wax on clear coat though..	-1
First, these are not clear. They are white (and slightly translucent). Second, these are very rigid. You would think that they would be soft considering what they are supposed to do but that is not the case. Though they might protect the paint on your garage wall, they are definitely hard enough to chip the paint on a car door.  A day after I installed them in my garage, both warped and now neither sits flush against the wall.  Overall, this was a big waste of money for me.	-1
These are not as soft as they look. They are hard plastic and they really don't protect the paint on a car door very well considering how rigid this plastic is. What's worse is that just a few days after I installed them, they warped. Now they don't sit flat against the wall. Overall this is a complete waste of money. Adhesive backed 1/4" thick cork is probably a better option.	-1
I'm disappointed in this product. It's advertised to remove scratches. Unfortunately this product does not do what it states. I'm not sure any product on the market for the average person at home can remove scratches from your vehicle. The only way I have had scratches removed from my truck was through a detail shop. If there is a product on the market that removes scratches without having to go to a detail shop,  please let me know.	-1
just wax nothing special	-1
Does not work. Followed all the directions step by step from their YouTube channel...	-1
It does not work for me.	-1
waste of money..did not do anything..just created a mess	-1
not work.	-1
My bottle came opened and almost empty.	-1
Buffed the scratch areas which momentarily disappeared....then the scratches reappeared.	-1
Really hoped to  be in the 5 star camp, and followed all their instructions, but this completely failed to remove scratches on my motorcycle fairing (plastic) and gas tank (metal). In fact the shine just enhanced the scratch and made it more visible. Awful.	-1
Worthless! I am very disappointed with Meguiar's I've always used their products. I have a newer dark gray truck, a couple very minor scratches, it did nothing for them. I even have a scuff mark in the clear coat and it did nothing for it. I seriously don't know how this product can get a good review.  I will try something else stay tuned.	-1
I have a Porter Cable 7424 polisher which I purchase several years ago.  I always used it with some pads and bonnets from Griots Garage, but I decided to give the Meguiar pads a try this time.  I use my polisher with a Porter Cable "18001 hook and loop standard pad" and I never have had a problem with the Griots products.  I attached the Meguiar pad (which is really just a round piece of foam with some cheesy felt or something glued on the top)and after a couple of hours of use, the Porter Cable pad had basically cut through the cheap foam, ruining it.  Disappointed, I contacted Meguiars customer service.  They agreed that the Porter Cable hook and loop pad was was safe to use with the Meguiar foam pads, but was  basically told the problem I had was because of: 1) My backing plate was was "bad" and had rough edges  2)  I was using too much pressure or 3)  My backing pad was "very old" and could be brittle  I can not see how they justify selling these foam pads for $10 a pop!  Save your money and look for a better product - that is what I am going to do.  The Meguiar pads I bought are going back	-1
not what i expected. would work for other stuff probably. who cares.	-1
It may not be fair to the product itself, but I do object very much to the product image which shows two pads - when you are getting one only. Some may argue that it is to show front and back of the pad, but sorry; I don't buy that! The pad, by the way, works like a charm. By far the best way to wax a car, much better than a lambswool pad, which has a tendency to heat up the lacquer and cause swirl marks.	-1
I have use these pads before but this one fell apart on the first job. I was buffing the wax off my boat and it fail within 30 minutes. I use it on my porter-cable and it just fell apart. I am not very happy. I normally would recommend these pads because other ones I have are okay but not this one. I hope this is not what going to happen in the future or I will but something different	-1
After my first few uses I stored this and five months later I opened it to see the compound had broken down and separated causing a film of oil to sit on top of the lubricant.	-1
Every utube mechanic said that this was the stuff to have when replacing nuts and bolts. I found it messy and useless. A good cleaning and silicone spray works much better	-1
For the first two uses they worked fine.  On the third use, the backing started to separate from the pad. Not a good value. I am sorry I bought them.	-1
We used it to wax a boat. The velcro on the back separated from the rest of the pad and flew off while in use! Not happy with longevity!	-1
I was not impressed with results I got. I had some light swirls in my paint, and was hoping this product would help. It really didn't do much is about the same as wax.	-1
After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the "frequently bought together deal" including the 6.5" finishing pad and the 6.5" polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7" which include a recess to make centering the polisher's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7" pads are actually machine washable.  The Velcro pad is attached far more securely.  The older 6.5" pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.  There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0"  or this older 6.5" pad, it's just that Meguiar's has improved and updated their pads now.  The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad, that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0" pad a no-brainer.  Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.

I've always been a fan of Meguiar's products and I can see how they are popular here on Amazon because they are readily available and have a big consumer name behind them, so I was quite excited to get these pads home and try them. Having used them on several complete vehicle and having tried other brands for an extended time, I feel comfortable putting a review out there for the Meguiar's Soft Buff Foam Pads.  These pads fit perfectly onto any 6" hook and loop backplate on a DA polisher. They fit snug and I never worried about them falling off in the middle of use. In terms of performance, I would say the cutting, polishing, and finishing pads underperformed in terms of their respected functions. Because they are flat pads, they do not hold and apply product as well as a pad with a textured surface. The flat pad also makes it easier to stop the pad from rotating on the surface when applying more pressure to your DA polisher. This is reason enough for me to not want to continue using these pads, but there is an even bigger reason I can not recommend these pads.  The hook and loop patch on the rear of the pad does not fully cover the back of the foam pad. When you attach these pads to a backplate, the backplate edge comes in contact with the foam on the edge of the pad. When you apply any pressure with your DA polisher on, the backplate will begin to cut into the foam pad slowly. After 6 vehicles, the edges of all the Meguiar's pads have fully separated and shredded. This problem could have easily been addressed had the hook and loop patch covered the entire back of the pad.  Because of the performance, design, and quality issues, I find the Meguiar's pads highly disappointing and completely unusable. If you are looking for very good quality pads, look at Lake Country CCS pads. These pads have a hook and loop surface that covers the entire back and the pad surface has pockets to hold and apply more product. Lake Country makes several types of pads, but you'll be well off getting their&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CCS-Yellow-Cutting-Pad/dp/B000N3WSWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CCS Yellow Cutting Pad</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CCS-White-Polishing-Pad/dp/B000ZSHDMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CCS White Polishing Pad</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CCS-Gray-Finishing-Pad/dp/B000ZSC7IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CCS Gray Finishing Pad</a>&nbsp;over the Meguiar's offerings.	-1
This did absolutely nothing to reduce the appearance of a miner scratch we have on the side of our painted motorhome. We could have applied a wax and received the same result. We even tried applying with a machine but still did nothing to reduce it.	-1
Scratches disappear when applied, but are back after the product dries the next day or so. Not worth the price WD-40 does almost as well.	-1
This product is useless, even small scratches don't come out, I tried several times to polish out the scratches but to no avail, waste of money!	-1
Purchased this product to remove a minor scratch, it ate through my clearcoat and left me with $400 in damage. Had an auto detailer look at the damage before getting it fixed, he asked what product caused it and I told him "ScratchX 2.0" - he replied "Oh, I would never even use that stuff, it's too abrasive."  Bottom line, from my experience with this product: do not purchase it under any circumstance unless you are very experienced working on cars.  This is truly a one star item. Avoid at all costs.	-1
A great product that works really well on clearcoat finishes to remove minor scratches and scuffs.  Unfortunately the product is packaged in the worst package ever made. You squeeze the bottle to dispense the product from the bottom facing nozzle, with result that the product splatters sideways - perpendicular to the nozzle across 360 degrees. You get nothing or it sprays out half the bottle in every direction, and the product stains clothing, walls, concrete and blacktop. Most of the product ends up being wasted as result.  Buy the product but lose the packaging.	-1
I have a couple scratches in the clear coat and some in the paint. It really doesn't get rid of conceal anything. I wouldn't buy it again. I'll just continue to wash and wax my car and once the scratches get to be to much I'll get it repainted.	-1
Not impressed with this product, it didn't mask or fix the swirl marks in my paint. followed as described and not worth the time.	-1
Doesn't work worth a darn.  Regular wax works better than this product.  Very disappointed with Mequiar which I thought was a good brand.  I will go back to Turtle products from now on.	-1
this is a late followup, this product does not work at all.  no idea why i bought it, shouldve been more careful.	-1
As title says - waste of time, money and calories. I have 08 BMW 335i Sport. Silver color. Have long scratches similar to those that guy posted in product images. Spent almost an hour, tried all different techniques. This product simply doesn't work. If you have a new car with nice paint, I would avoid buying this. It might work for some old cars which paint is in different condition, but not for me - sorry.  P.S: I bought a full set of Meguiar's paint care, you can find my reviews on other products as well. What actually worked for me (somewhat) is Ultimate Wax and Clay Kit (contaminant removal kit), Clay Kit is very hard to apply though, but it works.	-1
It just does not worked and the white line (done by some key or wire) remains there! Do not waste your money!	-1
It was impossible to make the edges straight.  It looked ugly after a few weeks--all wrinkled--  I had to throw it away after 2 months.	-1
I purchased this product to do... something, but it didn't hide or conceal the light scratches in my clear coat any better than a thick coat of paste wax did.  In short, if you're looking to remove scratches, investigate another product.	-1
Did not work.  I would have given it 1 star but I guess there is a chance I didn't use it properly.  I tried to glue my Ford truck Mirror back on using this twice.  I followed the directions precisely.  Then I went into my windshield repair shop  (Tahoma Glass) and they re-mounted it in 10 minutes for free.  It's been close to a year and no problems	-1
i tried it on a superficial scratch, and kept rubbing the product several times, and reapplied 3 time and scratch is stil there, i tried it with foam pad, microfiber pad, microfiber towel, worst product meguairs produce.	-1
This stuff is spendy compared to most of the other scratch removal products, so I did some homework before buying. Meguiars put together a very nice video of Scratch X in action on their website and I was sold. And indeed, it worked fantastic. Put a little time and work into it, and your car will be scratch free just like the day it was painted.  Unfortunately, that appearance only lasts between 1-3 months. Then your car is back to its old, scratched appearance. I believe the "2.0" in the product name refers to how many months you can reasonably expect it to work until you're out there yet again polishing the same old spot you thought was gone.  If you plan on dumping your car or selling it to some poor schmuck, this is for you. It's the ultimate concealer. As far as the work of actually removing the scratch, no go on that. I haven't quite figured out what makes this stuff so special, but it seems to be little more than makeup or coverup for cars. It works on the same premise as Clinique or Loreal Paris.  Maybe someone out there likes spending half an hour ever few months polishing the same spot on your car. If that's your thing, buy two tubes for a year of fun. But for the person who wants a solution that lasts, keep looking. I still am.	-1
I wanted this to work like others before it.  I follow the written directions and get no results.  seems to help with the faintest of scratches but other than that, no help.  I tried a few times and got very little results.  I will try with a friend who does detailing and try for other results.  Maybe my expectations were too high, like the latest summer sequel to an old franchise.  Go in expecting small results.  Will update if I see anything new happen with my next and maybe last try.  Car: 2003 BMW M3  Small scrapes on door from get open door knick and finger nail scratches at door handle.  Considering pictures.  If I do that means this worked or tried other product and sharing results.	-1
cannot use with water spots from rain	-1
Does not last long at all.	-1
Worst wax I have ever tried. As others have stated, the applicator is cheap, product goes on uneven because of the applicator. Extremely difficult to remove. Leaves nothing but streaks. Luckily I had old carnauba wax to use instead of this. I used this inside my garage, out of the sun and around 70 - 75 degrees. I tried this because of the positive reviews. Maybe this was an old product or Amazon doesn't store it in a temp controlled environment.  This is the second product from Mequiars I have purchased from amazon and have been disappointed with.	-1
Great product, but it costs just $9.00 at your local Walmart.	-1
The main reason why I give this product only 2 stars is because of two major downfalls: paint residue and durability.  First of all this product will leave a white residue everywhere! This mostly ends up on trim, rubber and any cracks/crevices the wax gets into and is almost impossible to remove completely! A real headache and should be avoided.  Secondly, this product is just a basic wax. So it won't last in any harsh weather condition, especially hot sun or snow, and must be reapplied on a constant basis and layered to keep your paint protected.  Nowadays there are many much better products out there that can give a much better and lasting protection for your vehicle. For about the same cost you can get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Meguiar-s-NXT-Generation-Tech-Wax-2-0-18-Ounce-Liquid/dp/B0002UQATS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Meguiar's  NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 (18-Ounce Liquid)</a>&nbsp;which does not leave a residue and lasts longer.

That way you get the detailer (a MUST for maintaining a lasting shine) along with the wash fluid, tire shine, and applicators.  Peace, Ben	-1
First the pro's.  This wax is easy on and easy off.  Unlike every other wax I was able to apply to the entire vehicle (in the shade) and then buff off.  It leaves a pretty descent shine.  Unfortunately NXT is far from the perfect product.  Although the product description indicates it removes swirls, it did nothing on the 2 cars I used it on.  Doesn't clean at all.  Maybe its not supposed to?  This wasn't too big a deal since I usually clean my paint before I wax.  The biggest disappointment however is the durability.  Lasted less than 3 weeks. One vehicle is a SUV, not a vehicle I want to wax every 3 weeks.	-1
Maybe I'm missing something but it didn't work for me at all, wanted it to hold my wing mirror in place on my motorcycle after the thread was stripped slightly, but it only lasted a day	-1
did not come with nozzle.  WORTHLESS	-1
Used on a black paint job and product left streak marks. As I read through the long list of reviews, streaking on black paint jobs is a problem with this product.  I returned the wax and won't use again	-1
The product seems is a thread locker and nothing seems to be wrong with that.  but my tube was pretty much half empty.  thats not cool.	-1
Bought this wax after it was considered one of the best.  Washed and clayed my car in the shade.  Paint was cool to touch.  Applied the wax with the included pad, which seemed cheap and felt harsh - not soft like the one included with the Collinite wax I use on my Corvette.  After applying the wax, I let it dry.  I have been waxing cars since the 70s, even using old fashioned paste wax.  This crap was the hardest wax I have ever tried to remove.  It literally was unbelievable.  I was talking to myself as I was trying to get it off the car, using microfiber towels, of course. Horrible, and then when done, the finish was streaky and looked like crap.  Cheap NuFinish, which I used to use, is MUCH easier to apply and wipe off and actually leaves an even, smooth finish.  I'm not plugging NuFinish at all -- just saying that the cheap stuff outperforms this junk.	-1
The worst wax I've ever used. Even the car wash stuff is better. I bought it cause i have a black car and wanted to avoid white or yellow residue in hard to reach places. And consumer reports rated it highly.  However this stuff left my car looking like i dumped cooking oil all over it. Streaky and not shiny at all with a noticeable film. 65 degrees in the morning shade and it would not buff out. I think with a buffer it would come off but that doesn't count as easy removal in my opinion.  After reading some reviews it seems like I'm not alone in having trouble on black paint.  Although it left all my plastic and black trim looking ok. I didn't have the staining trouble like others.  Such a bummer. Very expensive. Waste of time. Awful look.	-1
ordered "advanced formula" received aluminium instead.  might work great but they are two different products and i didn't get what i ordered	-1
Streaky, runny, horrible bottle.	-1
I bought some of this yesterday to wax my car. Someone, who really knows how to care for his vehicles, recommended this to me since he said it was less prone to leaving dried white wax residue in the cracks. After claying my car, I shook the bottle and tried to apply it. A watery solvent came out and dripped all over the pad and car. I tried to rub it off, but it dried to a sticky film. I shook the bottle for a few minutes, and still could not get the liquid to mix correctly. I took it back for a refund. It appears to have a shelf life, and that is the reason I'm publishing this review. I bought some Meguiar's Carnauba Gold wax to replace it. I didn't want to risk getting another 'old' bottle from the retailer. Fresh NXT Tech Wax may work very well.	-1
This did not hold up to the vibrations of my lawn mower.  It failed in the first half hour of use.	-1
I used tech wax & it was ok so I tried tech wax 2.0 & it sucks.  I am done with there waxes. I use there polishes & there ok but no more wax.	-1
The product works great however I was not very happy to receive a bottle that was maybe a third of the way full at best. Not even close to the 8 ounces it claims to be. There was no evidence of leakage or spillage during shipping. Not sure if this was an isolated incident or somebody shipped me a previously used bottle but a tamper resistant seal would be nice.	-1
Meguiars came out with the original NXT around 2005 and it was actually a pretty good product.  Not the greatest shine but was fairly durable and easy to apply.  Then, sometime a few years later, NXT 2.0 was introduced and to me, it was a huge step backwards.  Although it just received a highly favorable rating from the big consumer magazine, it is far from one of the best products on the market.  This version 2.0 has very poor gloss characteristics on dark colored cars and the durability is just terrible, literally no more than six weeks before water stops sheeting off the car.  I maintain eight different personal cars and so am almost always waxing something.  I think all the high priced, multi-step products are just so much snake oil being sold at outrageous prices and trust me, I've tried almost all of them.  Good surface prep is the key to the success of any wax/synthetic product and that involves clay, light cut cleaner, polish and then the final way.  Once prepped properly, just about any product will do really well and, if applied regularly, will protect the finish and make future preps unnecessary.  My current favorite for durability and shine is Turtle Wax cleaner/carnuba although the good old Meguiars cleaner was in the purple bottle is still a darn good product at a bargain price.	-1
Let me begin by stating that I have been using car care products for over 40 years and consider  myself a serious car maintenance amateur.  I love Meguiars products, having probably a dozen of them on my maintenance cart, and I wanted to like it.  NXT Next Generation wax goes on easy enough, and produces minimal dust, but it epic fails as an automotive finish. It's leaves a greasy, dull finish on the car, defeating the purpose of applying it. After using this, I had to use another product to actually get a real shine. In a word: it sucks!  Definitely not recommended.  Some of the favorable reviewers seem to make excuses for undesirable outcomes, like misapplication, misunderstood use of the product and such, but I find these are just that: excuses...and poor ones at that.	-1
I've owned this wax for some time.  It doesn't last more than a month - if that. It's a pain to put on and take off.  It goes on ok, but taking it off is another story, leaves a almost a oily residue until you wash your car, or use numerous towels/microfiber to take it off.  How much do you really want to rub your paint to get the residue off (I have black paint)?  I haven't really seen any good protection from the elements or from birds/bugs.  One postitive is that it does smell good when applying it but I'm sure Meguiars added the fragrance for some marketing perspective.  All in all, for the price compared to durability - this stuff is a waste and not sure why Meguiars even put it on the market.	-1
this product is good but not outstanding as Barry Meguiar says not last as long as he says I've used both summer and winter and in 6 weeks lost many of its properties. in the real world, not in the world of Barry Meguiar you have to wax the car every month if you want to protect your car. is not true that regardless of price waxes last for many months. since you apply the wax starts to degrade the environment, sun. uv, rain, dust. when you wash you remove the wax inevitably part because dust and pollution and the polluters and stick to the wax and when you remove these contaminants also remove the wax.	-1
This product is easy to apply and easy to wipe off.  But, on black cars especially, it does not give a nice deep glossy or "wet look" shine.  It leaves more of a streaky oily finish.  I switched over to yellow carnuba wax and the difference was night and day.  I have a full bottle that I no longer use and it's just sitting in the garage collecting dust.  If you have a black car, and stick with carunba wax instead of synthetics. Meguiar's to make great products, but this one fails to impress.  I get a better shine off of Meguiar's cleaner wax than this NXT stuff.  But a friend introduced me to Mothers pure carnuba wax and I have since made a switch in brand.  I mean the shine you get with this stuff is just insane.	-1
Flashy new packaging, a fancy new name, and exuberant claims of futuristic technological advancement can falsely lead many no believe that this is the best wax they have ever used. IT IS NOT. This wax is not half bad, but it is definitely nothing new and not any sort of innovation. Works equally as well as other cheaper brands and WILL NOT remove swirl marks on dark cars just like other cheaper brands. Trust me, your car WILL be 'naked' if you believe everything they claim.	-1
I use mainly all Meguiar's products for the care of my family's two vehicles. This product works as advertised, which is to say that it restores the plastic, rubber and vinyl trim to black. But water causes this product to run like a woman's mascara and it leaves ugly streaks on my black 07 F-150. I know that having a black vehicle amplifies all imperfections, so it may not show on other vehicle colors. But its too much for me to ignore. It also can leave a greasy look if you don't wipe it again with a dry cloth. Its still greasy-feeling when you touch it, though. I am going to try Adam's SuperVRT.	-1
Spill everywhere when I open the shipping box. Reason is because the cap is loose. The anti-seize is great but the bottle is not great.	-1
Not much in the can, this thing may have been opened and used, also didn't receive the one pictured. The cans at autozone are nearly filled to the top, this one is less than half full, way less than 8oz., If this is something permatex is doing now, I'll be switching brands.	-1
did not work for my auto...as apposed to product info.	-1
Does not come with installation/removal key!!!! What the hell... Really? I have to buy the installation key separately. This does not make sense at all. Should've bought the Gorilla brand instead. You get what you pay for. The actual lug nut is really small compared to the OEM one also, which makes me wonder if they are up to the task. I recommend anyone trying to find a good lock lug nut to find a better choice. This lug nut is really not for a truck, I looks and feels too weak.	-1
Didn't really hate it as much as hated to waste my money on it.  The lubricant was already included with the O2 Sensor I bought.  Either I did not research the O2 Sensor right. Maybe it said the lubricant was included.  Now the tube will just roll around in my tool box unopened.  Probably never have a use for it.	-1
When I received the product in the mail I was surprised with how light it was. When I opened the bottle however I found that the bottle was only filled up about half way.  The product in and of itself does work as advertised but the fact that you get short-handed by only a half full bottle is extremely frustrating to me. I would compare it to opening a bag of chips. 60% air, 40% product.  Had I received a full bottle this would have been 4-5 stars.	-1
2003 ML500 brakes still squeal in cold weather.	-1
I bought this from Amazon last year and went to use it again the other day. The cap had rusted through for some reason! I keep this in a waterproof toolbox with a desiccant to keep the humidity low, but somehow it just rotted away. They product itself is great, but it's pretty hard to use now that the lid is gone.	-1
#7 "Tan colored" Show car glaze was the best product ever, for over 40 years, the new "white colored"  formula made in late 2016/, is not as good a product,  it looks like the new formula is water-based?? and is nothing more than white milky glaze slime. I used the new formula then came back with the original formula (the little I had left) and what a huge difference it made.  very disappointed to see  a great product go away and disappointed we where where not notified on the packaging.   I would like to shed some light on the review above, The previous formula was a tan colored product with an oily consistency, it was also free of any grit,  it was a "0" cut substance. This has not changed in the new formula also "0" cut. What has changed is the way it responds to your paint, in my opinion. the Tan formula was almost sticky, it would lift dirt or light dry over spray off your paint and if polished with elbow grease or buffer it left your paint super glassy and dirt free, without  removing paint. Remember both are  "0" cut products. The new product does not lift dirt, it just leaves it where it is and glazes it,  onto your paint. as i stated earlier i applied the Tan over the new white formula, my white towel picked up dirt that the new formula left on my paint.  On another car,  i first electric buffed with a light compound and then applied the new #7,  it seems to be ok, but i miss being able to apply Tan #7 by hand and get great results, even if there is a little dust or light dry over spray dust on the car. I will look for a substitute product in the future.	-1
Do not like it, it streaks all over, and its very hard to remove once it dries and the shine is not that super as claimed, I have other waxes that do a MUCH better job of shining my car.  It took me hours to remove it, even after using a water spray, and I waxed inside an air conditioned garage and did not let it dry more than 5-10 minutes. Very disappointed, expected a lot more from such a fine company!	-1
I bought this per Amazon's recommendation to go with my new O2 sensors. After using it, I read the instructions on the O2 sensors, and they very specifically say not to use anything which does not specify that it is O2 sensor compatible. I cannot find any such labeling on this packaging. I hope it does not ruin my O2 sensors.	-1
Good for 1 waxing. Will not but again.	-1
It appears they have changed the formulation of this product recently. It used to be quite viscous and was a nice tan color. It also used to "creep" quite a bit more when spread on paper (and therefore the paint).  The last two bottles I received from Amazon were a yucky pea-soup color and thinner in consistency. I have been in contact with Mequiar's who seemed to be quite interested at first, but I haven't heard back from them after providing the photos they requested. I will be returning the 2 bottles I bought and will try to find some older stock locally.  Additional Information : It's been over a week since I contacted meguiar's with my question that they initially seemed so eager to answer. I sent an additional email to one "Brendan Taft" at Meguiar's to remind him of the situation and re-ask my question, but still no response. I have no choice but to conclude that they have changed (and probably cheapened) this product and won't admit it. I am returning the two bottles I purchased from Amazon and was lucky enough to be able to find a bottle of the old formula at my FLAPS (at double Amazon's price).  I have always used Mequir's because they used to offer quality products. After my experience, I will be actively looking for alternatives.  I finally heard back from Brendan Taft at Meguiar's :    "Dennis,    We have not heard word of a re-formulated #7 Show Car Glaze."  Love the wording of the reply.  I would like to include the pictures I took of the product and sent to Meguiar's; then everyone could judge for themselves if they have changed the product. I find it strange that Amazon has the capability to handle video reviews, but pictures can't be added.	-1
not recommended	-1
It may not be fair to the product itself, but I do object very much to the product image which shows two pads - when you are getting one only. Some may argue that it is to show front and back of the pad, but sorry; I don't buy that! The pad, by the way, works like a charm. By far the best way to wax a car, much better than a lambswool pad, which has a tendency to heat up the lacquer and cause swirl marks.	-1
Not really impressed with this product. The Meguiar's cleaner/wax product does a much better job. This may be good for some cars, but not mine.	-1
It calls for an additional type (?) of part to attach to Ur machine. I don' have it so it sets unused. Would no recommend.	-1
Broke apart on it's first use.  Even on low speed, it just fell apart.  I would not recommend this to anyone.	-1
I have an 04 Black G35 coupe that I haven't waxed in 2-3 years, if not longer.  My god, I used the  M105 M205 Meguiar's 7 Mirror Glaze Professional Show Car Glaze Meguiar's Mirror Glaze 20 Polymer Sealant  I applied all using the porter cable polisher and a red disc for the M105 and M205.  WOW.  Especially the M105,  It truly made the car look like it had been re-painted.  This m105 is truly totally amazing stuff.  In the future I will leave the mirror glaze off of the routine and just do the M105, M205 and the Mirror Glaze M20 Polymer Sealant but until next spring, I think I can do just another coat or two of the Mirror Glaze 20 Polymer Sealant as the car looks fantastic and just needs more coats of protection now.	-1
For the first two uses they worked fine.  On the third use, the backing started to separate from the pad. Not a good value. I am sorry I bought them.	-1
not too good why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is not too good.  strange.	-1
We used it to wax a boat. The velcro on the back separated from the rest of the pad and flew off while in use! Not happy with longevity!	-1
After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the "frequently bought together deal" including the 6.5" finishing pad and the 6.5" polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7" which include a recess to make centering the polisher's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7" pads are actually machine washable.  The Velcro pad is attached far more securely.  The older 6.5" pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.  There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0"  or this older 6.5" pad, it's just that Meguiar's has improved and updated their pads now.  The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad, that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0" pad a no-brainer.  Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.  Here are the links for the newest and improved pads: <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SOFTBUFF-2-0-FOAM-POLISHING-PAD-7-inch/dp/B0036VTNGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SOFTBUFF 2.0 FOAM POLISHING PAD 7 inch</a> <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Meguiar-s-W-9207-7-Soft-Buff-2-0-Foam-Finishing-Pad/dp/B001TKWRHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Meguiar's W 9207 7" Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Finishing Pad</a>	-1

I've always been a fan of Meguiar's products and I can see how they are popular here on Amazon because they are readily available and have a big consumer name behind them, so I was quite excited to get these pads home and try them. Having used them on several complete vehicle and having tried other brands for an extended time, I feel comfortable putting a review out there for the Meguiar's Soft Buff Foam Pads.  These pads fit perfectly onto any 6" hook and loop backplate on a DA polisher. They fit snug and I never worried about them falling off in the middle of use. In terms of performance, I would say the cutting, polishing, and finishing pads underperformed in terms of their respected functions. Because they are flat pads, they do not hold and apply product as well as a pad with a textured surface. The flat pad also makes it easier to stop the pad from rotating on the surface when applying more pressure to your DA polisher. This is reason enough for me to not want to continue using these pads, but there is an even bigger reason I can not recommend these pads.  The hook and loop patch on the rear of the pad does not fully cover the back of the foam pad. When you attach these pads to a backplate, the backplate edge comes in contact with the foam on the edge of the pad. When you apply any pressure with your DA polisher on, the backplate will begin to cut into the foam pad slowly. After 6 vehicles, the edges of all the Meguiar's pads have fully separated and shredded. This problem could have easily been addressed had the hook and loop patch covered the entire back of the pad.  Because of the performance, design, and quality issues, I find the Meguiar's pads highly disappointing and completely unusable. If you are looking for very good quality pads, look at Lake Country CCS pads. These pads have a hook and loop surface that covers the entire back and the pad surface has pockets to hold and apply more product. Lake Country makes several types of pads, but you'll be well off getting their&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CCS-Yellow-Cutting-Pad/dp/B000N3WSWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CCS Yellow Cutting Pad</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CCS-White-Polishing-Pad/dp/B000ZSHDMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CCS White Polishing Pad</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CCS-Gray-Finishing-Pad/dp/B000ZSC7IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CCS Gray Finishing Pad</a>&nbsp;over the Meguiar's offerings.	-1

This didn't work for taking ink stains off my leather purse. But I'm sure it does a good job with regular leather cleaning. I'll keep it and use it to clean my car seats I guess.	-1
This stuff really did not work for me. It gets some dirt off the leather, but it did not make my leather shine and did not take away some of the hard to get dirt. I have an Audi A4 2013. I would not recommend buying this if you have that type of car or a car that is fairly new. It just plain does not do what it says it does. A total waste of money. It smells pretty good, and does take a little of the dirt off, but not worth it. There has got to be a better product out there than this.	-1
This will not work with most car leather. If you have conventional leather (not a Ferrari or King Ranch edition f150) your car probably has sealed leather seats. They have a transparent vinyl coating on top to protect from spills and to reduce maintenance. I would guess that 90% of cars have this. I used this before knowing about vinyl coatings and all it did was make my seats slippery and coat the windshield with evaporated product that couldn't be absorbed into the seats. You can test to see if you have coated seats by putting a drop of water on the leather. It will darken if the leather is uncoated and can absorb the water. I am giving it a bad review because there should be some instruction in the description or on the bottle that this is not for vinyl-coated seats.	-1
I used this on my 2012 Lexus LS460.  It went on easy, smelled a little weird, but maybe in a nice way.  I came back to look at it two days later (have not driven the car or taken it out of my garage yet) to find a completely spotty and horrible look to my leather and trim.  I don't know what is going on yet, and I definitely need to see this in brighter light, but it could be that this product distroyed my leather and trim in the car.  I really hope not.  I will let people know.	-1
I had a white boat which was very oxidized and Flitz worked great. I had tried lots of other products to no avail but the flitz made it look new again and it kept its shine. Now I have a black boat and its a different story. At first the black gelcoat shined up great but over night that shine went away. After 3 polishes (with a makita buffer) it looked a lot better but it really didn't last long. I'll use flitz again on a white gelcoat boat but never again on a colored gelcoat boat.	-1
It didn't work on my silver Honda. The roof looks the same (faded) after using this product several times with an orbital buffer	-1
The intended use for this was to buff out scratches in a clear Stratoglass enclosure on a boat. Also purchased the kit with their large buffing ball and and a 3000 rpm drill, as per instructions. I believe the kit package stated this was its intended use. Scratches did not buff out. Later tried it on some fading red gelcoat but it did not do a very good job their either. I used it on some mag wheels and there it worked ok, but not as good as Mothers Brand. I tried it on an anodized aluminum Tuna Tower that's been turning from silver to white. There it worked good; however after about a week you could see it was back to turning white. In fairness, neither my professional detail people nor I have ever found a product that worked well and lasted more then a few months at most on the aluminum and we have tried many. In hindsight I should have returned this. Probably would cost more to do that then its worth.	-1
