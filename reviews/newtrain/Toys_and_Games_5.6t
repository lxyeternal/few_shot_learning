I didn't see this it was a gift but I heard that they loved it and are enjoying it.	1
The main part was made of some seriously flimsy plastic.... and it's SUPER hard to clean after you use it. I'm sure I will only get one more use out of it before I will be too fed up with it to use it again.	-1
gift	1
Great classroom product.  My students love watching the pea plants grow!  Easy to use, very little mess.  Perfect for the primary classroom and a great price.  Highly recommend.	1
My four year old and I worked on this project together after she received it for her birthday. I created a "science notebook" to write down our observations, including whether we observed roots, leaves, flowers, how much sunlight the plants receives, and whether we watered it. She also wanted to count the number of leaves and the height of each of the plants on "observation days," usually every other day for several weeks. It took about 15 minutes every other day, although sometimes she requested to write down observations more frequently if something very interesting happened like a new plant sprouted or grew several inches. We initially wet eight seeds, four pea and four bean in damp paper towels. All germinated and we transferred two of each into the window for a total of four plants. All four sent down long roots, but only three of the plants sprouted (one of the pea plants never had any stem or leaf growth). The two bean plants are currently over 20 inches tall each, and the one pea plant is about five inches tall, The window itself is made of plastic that is not terribly sturdy. It is sufficient for exploration of plant growth and has withstood the handling of my four year old though. She loves to water her plants, and her excitement to show me how they have changed is priceless! Highly recommend!	1
Bought for my 5 year old grandson.  He had a great time with this.	1
I have a brown thumb and I was able to grow peas with my kidlet. They sprout quickly too, especially if you follow the instructions to start soaking them before planting.  I would avoid using all the pellets they say to use because ours hydrated to an abnormally large amount that would never have fit into the plastic container.  Roots burst out within days. The journal idea was great and it gave my kids a sense of time and changes. She's on the young side so we also had her draw pictures of what she saw every day to mark the changes. Great toy and easy to maintain and setup.	1
easy to see the roots, but a little flimsy in design. HARD to empty out. all in all- i will use it again and again in my classroom	1
I bought this for my son as a project for spring break. We opened the package and there were NO SEEDS. Fortunately, I had bought some baby carrot seeds to supplement the ones that were SUPPOSED to be included. Ridiculous to get all set up for a project and not be able to complete it. Horrible QA. I think I should get a partial refund. Not like this is inexpensive for what you get to begin with. Have seeds on hand unless you want to risk delaying your project and disappointing your child.	-1
Satisfied customer.  We get to watch our vegies grow and will soon plant in the garden.  Momma is going to get her bean plants!	1
Ibought htis for my boys to watch and learn.  It is a good idea and they check on it every now and then, but I am the one taking care of it.  Can't rate it low for that.  It is nice to wactch everyday.  My boys are not interested in watching plants grow.  My younger son picked the green beans that come with it and within a few days.. it takes off.  I have it in my kitchen window and waiting for the sprouts to grow.  Grows very fast so kids will see a difference everyday. Very nice and worth the money if your child likes to watch things grow.	1
Urban Myth is something like Trivial Pursuit, where the trivia falls into six different categories and you must be on the correct category to win something after answering the question. However, instead of open-ended questions, these are true or false trivia questions.  Sounds simple, you say? Think again! Some of these are really very tricky, and they're written in such a manner that it's nearly impossible to guess if something REALLY happened or if it didn't.  The object of the game is actually to collect the question cards themselves, which have letters on the back. Be the first one to spell out "TRUE" or "MYTH" with your cards, and you win.  I liked this game, I think it's a really fun twist on trivia games. The true-false aspect does level out the playing field a little bit (everyone's got a 50/50 shot at each answer). We found that the game moved quite quickly, so we managed to fit a couple of rounds into the allotted space for game-playing.	1
I got this along with a bug book because my boys, 4 and 5, have started expressing a lot of interest.  What's to say?  The Peeper does a great job of displaying captured critter magnified from both above and below.  My minor complaint would be that the top piece doesn't fit as snugly as I would like.  I added some tape around the edge to make the top less likely to come off when inconvenient.  Overall a great toy and has been holding up well so far. Approx 2 months.	1
magnifico	1
Stuff like this normally bugs me, but not this one. The kids love it.	1
Great!	1
love this for our grandkids	1
Awesome idea. Magnification could be so much better if a focus was available.	1
Love bugs then you'll love this!!	1
Disappointed that this broke within the first week. Stick to using a cup with plastic wrap instead.	-1
Great for little explorers.	1
The lid does not stay on. Wish I had bought something else.	-1
My 6 year old grandson, the bug expert!  He loved this toy for exploring his backyard, even though his mom insisted they stay in the backyard!	1
Bought this for my 6 year old grandson and he loves it.  Be sure though if you purchase this that you talk about harmful insects that they should not handle.  This Creature Peeper is very well constructed and thought out.	1
Everything about this Creature Peeper was done right, except that the compartment doesn't fasten shut! This is a two-piece item; the base contains the magnifier and peephole, and the creature compartment with magnifier sits atop the base, as you can see in the photo of the product. Unfortunately, the creature compartment simply sits atop the base - there is absolutely no fastener of any kind - not even tension - to secure it in place, which means that my 4-year old is CONSTANTLY upset because the slightest tip of the thing and the top falls right off, releasing whatever bugs were inside. I have to say, I continue to marvel that someone could design a product with such an insurmountable fatal flaw that results in the product being completely worthless. All they would have had to do was thread the two pieces so they could screw together, or add a couple quick-release clips or SOMETHING - even if they just sized the pieces so they would fit snugly and tension would hold them together - to secure the top to the bottom. This is one of the most unbelievably bad product designs I've seen. Unless this is for an older child - like 10 or above - who will be able to use it in an exceedingly cautious manner so as not to accidentally knock the top off - I would avoid this like the plague.	-1
Great-granddaughter loved this. Still using it. She loves bugs so this is great to start out with. She is 6 years old.	1
I bought this for my nine year old grandson and he plays with it non-stop. Great toy that encourages imaginative play. It is larger than I thought it would be.	1
A happy customer in Hawaii!  I bought these for my son's preschool for their science table.  The kids really enjoyed it.  PS--Cheaper on Amazon than at Education Works!	1
this is a fantastic thing to have around for curious kids. i don't think it's a huuuuge improvement over a mason jar, but the kids love it. my son brings it outside when we garden, go to the park, and when we open up the worm bin. we use it for the bugs we find at home too. they love looking at the bugs, and they're good about letting them go too.  the viewfinder has fallen off a bit, but it's still functional/useable.	1
This is a very educational toy for children who like bugs. You can see both the top and bottom of the bug magnified and very clearly through the eye openings. My six year old in his back yard Safari gear has added this to his arsenal and loves it. The only negative comment I have is that I wish the top piece screwed onto the bottom as little hands have the potential of spilling the bug(s)and hopefully not in the house. Otherwise a great little scientific tool for kids and grownups.	1
We got this trailer for our son to go with his Bruder Roadmax Tractor and he loves it! He loves filling it with his duplos and dumping them! It also works with his Bruder Roadmax Dump truck and Backhoe!	1
We have several Bruder toys and their quality is just the outstanding and it's very nice, made with the details and durable toy. it's nice to have it in addition for the truck or tractor...	1
Great toy. My toddler loves it	1
My 3 year old loves these, they are built with quality and are sturdy!	1
Bruder trucks are awesome!  This is a farm tractor with a front end loader bucket attached.  The bucket is manipulated by hand and the cab roof hinges at the back allowing children to place things inside the tractor.  Our children place everything in there from balls and blocks to small dolls and animal figurines.  The tires are soft rubber and the windshield is clear acrylic.  We have about 10 Bruder toys and two young boys who give them a lot of use and abuse.  The toys are well made but be sure that you buy the ones that are age appropriate.  The Roadmax series is great for smaller children, two to five, because there are no removable small parts and the handles are large and easily manipulated by small hands.  Also, the colors are bright and eye catching reds, yellows and greens.  Bruder makes toys for older children with more smaller parts and realistic color schemes, but the moving parts of the older age appropriate toys can catch and pinch small hands, so be careful which toys you buy for the little ones.	1
Purchased this toy for my grandson when he was two.  It is very durable and he seemed to like it.	1
My nephew loved this truck at first sight. It's a great gift for a little kid and fun to play with. This item is sturdy and has some gadgets that keep the kids interested.	1
THE TOY CAME  VERY FAST AND IT IS  GREAT !!!!!!!!! MY GRAND  SON WILL LOVE THIS ONE.  I  AM GLAD  I  BOUGHT THIS	1
Bruder products are the greatest.  I haven't been disappointed yet.  Great size for a 3 year old to maneuver around.	1
We ordered this for my son's first birthday, early May 2011. He's not a brute with toys, however, within 6 months the bucket lift no longer functioned. Whenever he tries to put the bucket up high to push it around the house, it immediately falls back down. It functioned for the first 6 months but no longer. I contacted Amazon and was told we needed to contact Bruder. Despite repeated calls and emails to Bruder, I've never received an answer/response. I would think the product would have a one-year warranty but I'm too frustrated to continue trying to contact them. Suffice it to say, we won't be purchasing any more Bruder products, and cannot recommend them. My son still enjoys the toy but gets frustrated when it won't work properly.	-1
The roadmax series fills the large gap between use a few times and throw away sand toys and those that cost so much money you don't want to see them in the same. The are perfectly proportioned for 2-4 year olds, are inexpensive compared to the Pro-series, and everyone who sees then thinks they're a blast.	1
This tractor is great.  I looked and looked for a good durable and safe tractor for my 1 year old and I finally found it. There's no "name brand" like John Deere and there is no distinct color to make it seem like an International or an Allis-Chalmers. He can be rough with it and it has no affect what so ever.  Also the wheels are perfect.  They spin really well so it is really easy for him to push around.  I love this tractor so much that I plan to buy the rest of the line of trucks from this company.  I think the garbage truck will be next.  It looks great too.	1
My 5 yeat old is obsessed with space. This was perfect. He could hold each planet in his hand while we learned about it and then we hung them up in his room. They glow in the dark. You have to snap a few of them together. No big deal. One was loose so I set a little glue in the snap area and it's fine.	1
To be honest I was not expecting much when I ordered this for my son's room, but this shattered my expectations with how cheap and low quality this is. The planets are poorly painted and barely glow in the dark, even after using a Maglight to charge them up before hand. I had to tape some of the planets together since they didn't hold on there own. The glow in the dark stars that come with this are a joke. They are extremely tiny and are very poor quality. I just tossed them out and bought the National Geographic brand glow in the dark Moon and stars and they are awesome.	-1
My son loves these! I wish it came with a sun, but besides that these are wonderful!	1
It broke the same day we opened lol but no matter what my son loves it. It doesn't include the Sun lol but we made it with a balloon. They glow in the dark that's amazing for my kid jajaja.	1
ok	1
The book is excellent for learning and is hours of fun, however I hate how they're made out of paper and rip so easily!	1
My son is very happy with his planets. We love their glow. Nice product!	1
I'm giving this 4 stars only because the "240 pieces" label is kind of deceiving.  It has the planets and a few of the hard plastic stars that glow in the dark, but the vast majority of that number are glow in the dark stickers.  the stickers are hard to peel (bc they're so tiny), the glow in the dark coating scratches off of the easily, and they don't stick to walls well. That may sound like a lot, but I liked the rest of the set enough to only remove one star for it.  the planets are neat and glow well.  we hung them up all over the childrens' room, using the light fixture as the sun, and they're thrilled every night when we turn the lights off.	1
Pros: - Inexpensive toy great for younger kids - Includes everything you need to put it up, plus glow in the dark stars  Cons: - Granted its not super high quality - feels flimsy and the planets can fall apart if you don't add some scotch tape. - The instruction manual is printed in black and white - but they list the colors of the planets for you but it doesnt match exactly.	1
Now I am master of the solar system, Kneel before me in fear or I will pluck the sun from the ceiling. Ok really I purchased these for my daughter to hang up in her room to go with the billions and billions of glow in the dark stars on the ceiling. These are a cool teaching aid or perfect as a decoration. Or if you want to rule the universe this is a good start. .	1
perfect for room decor, she loves it, great seller	1
These were a huge hit. We only put up the planets. They are enjoyed every night by my space lover.	1
I bought this to use at VBS and it was a huge hit! The plastic isn't super thick so it's not heavy, but that also means that it breaks easily if it falls. I had to tape one planet together because the rim chipped when it fell out of my hand.	1
Damaged & plastic falling apart	-1
How about an actual product review?  This book features a story about Snow White, one about Cinderella and one about Ariel. The Snow White story involves the princess and the dwarfs helping a deer remove a thorn from its paw. The Cinderella story is about her getting ready for the ball. The Ariel story is about her going off to explore the shipwreck but returning in time for the concert.  Ina ddition to the stories, there are several games in the book, all age-appropriate. The final page is a simple game involving all three princesses and scenes/objects from their stories.  The educational value in the book is in reading, reading comprehension, vocabulary building, etc. If you're familiar w/ LeapPad books, you'll find this one in keeping with their usual standard. A nice choice for the preschool set; it would be nice if more LeapPad books were aimed at this level.	1
We have had an extensive Leap Pad library in our home for almost over 2 years now-this book is very fun for the girls-it brings their imagination to a fairytale land, yet at the same time they are learning. Totally recommend for any Disney Princess lover!!!	1
I was thoroughly unimpressed but it's a gift for a 3 year old so I thought it will probably be ok but no. My just turned 3 year old explained to me why each extremely cheap plastic ball was a poor representation of the planet it was suppose to be. So based on that...1 star. And truthful, they are a load of crap.	-1
These are so awesome! They glow nicely, and it includes everything you need to hang them. Even comes with a bunch of glowing stickers too. Happy customer here. They look fantastic in my sons room.	1
Great educational toy.	1
Cheaply made put me in mind of Easter eggs.	-1
My 5 yr old loves this set. We had to make our own sun though. Otherwise this would have been a 5 star rating. A solar system without it's Sol, is just a system. The Glow in the dark stickers are fun too.	1
These were a gift and we were told they looked great in her space room and they glowed longer than other glow in the dark products.	1
Better than I expected	1
My 6 year old boy loves this...we hung it in his room.  We bought a styrofoam ball and painted it yellow for the sun.	1
My 10y/o received this for his birthday.  He loves it	1
Cheap, don't recommend. Other better brands available	-1
g/grandson is into the solar system big time  , I had gotten him a smaller version from another company , but  found this, its way bigger,  stays lit longer & he's loving it many times over .......... might even buy him another set for the other side of the room .......	1
Actually...not as cheap looking as I thought they would be. They come with cute little star thumb tacks and fishing line to hang them buy. They glow brightly. My 3 year old son loves them and is learning the names of the planets (they at least sort of resemble the planets, including pluto, which the instructions have correctly identified as a dwarf planet).	1
Awesome gift for kids! Glows in the dark well. Comes with everything needed to hang them. Great learning tool.	1
Served their purpose for Vacation Bible School. But crack easily.	1
These look awesome and are the perfect size for a classroom.	1
I bought these for my 4 year old who is learning about the solar system in preschool. I thought it'd be nice to encourage his interest. He absolutely loves these. The bigger planets had to be assembled (putting the two halves together). There are also two stickers with the name of each planet (I found these a little harder to remove from the backing then I expected). The string that is provided is more than sufficient to hang up the planets. It would have been a nice touch if the star shaped push pins glowed in the dark. The included glow in the dark stickers were a pain to remove from the backing so I only used a few. We had some glow in the dark decals on the ceiling already which tied into the theme. The set comes with a little strip of putty and I'm not sure what it's for. Maybe to attach the planets that have to be assembled. These also don't have much glow to them.  Overall I would definitely recommend this set. It isn't top of the line but definitely worth the price. I was a bit disappointed that a sun wasn't included but we're just making it a craft project. We'll be making our own this weekend.	1
Wouldn't buy again. Should come pre assembled with better hanging option.	-1
Grandson loved them	1
Not worth the money, cheap plastic colors are aweful and some come apart. Not worth hanging up.	-1
Ordered two packages and both bags of balls arrived with crushed balls!	-1
Perfect size perfect amount!!	1
We ordered these to hang in our living room off a sprinkler pipe on the ceiling which already has xmas lights. The kit is pretty cute-there is no Sun though. As for glowing, they don't do much of that. We used wire xmas ornament hooks to hang them rather than the clear wire they came with. They look super cute and are a fun conversation piece. They range in size so the smallest is about 2" around and the largest is probably 7" ish.	1
Very cute planet set!	1
My son loves his planets and wants to show everyone who comes over his room. They take a lot of light to charge for a long time, but 10 minutes before bed time is enough to get them glowing until he's asleep.	1
This solar system is super cute. It really glows in the dark. It also comes with star wall stick on's. My son absolutely loves going into his room now at night just so he can see all these glow.	1
Horrible quality. Olympic a few balls didn't have a dent!!! They are super soft and not durable at all. If you can look past all the dents, they won't last past one play time.	-1
My sons have had these for a few months now and they are holding up wonderfully. Bright colors and the carrying bag is convient.	1
Terrible and cheaply made. Saturns ring won't stay put. Incredibly disappointing.	-1
This Solar System is so awesome! Planets glow in the dark, tons of clear string to hang the planets with push pins included. Extra glow in the dark stickers too.	1
Very nicely done  but don't glow very well unless have super bright light next to them for long long time. Barley even glow with regular bedroom light . Star stickers do not glow on walls either with regular room light	1
These are pretty cool but there's no sun!!! How is it called a 3D solar system without the very center of our Solar system??? Disappointing as I needed this for a project. Guess I should have paid attention to what they consider a solar system.	1
Terrible,  terrible, terrible approximately half the balls are poor quality that stay dented. I can't see how these would last. A few out of a hundred are real good, so you can see the potential but qc is non existent. Also nothing on the product confirms the bpa free claim. Could be a lie ?	-1
Bought his ball on sale. Love the bright colors. Filled an inexpensive tent with them, and it was a huge hit!	1
Kids love it	1
I have bought two of these sets now. I had them hanging in my bedroom and i could tell my baby wanted something to look at in his room. Now we are both very happy looking up at the planets and stars as a fall asleep.	1
Needs a sun!	1
We got these for my daughter and she was over the moon. Way over the moon. And totally into her glow in the dark solar system. <3	1
Good quality, looks cool, easy to put up.	1
Bought to go with a train ball pit.  The size may sound small but the balls are significantly larger than "regular" sized ball pit balls. I used a mix of both sizes though for variety and because I didn't know these larger balls existed :) the colors are bright and vibrant, balls were well packed, we didn't get any deflated or crushed balls and they hold up to my son sitting on them, laying on them, and possibly standing on them when he gets in the ball pit.	1
They are so sturdy! I've put all of my weight on them and they are uncrushable! My son has been so rough with them, setting his skateboard on them and jumping on it and none have been crushed. They did send 96, not 100, but oh well. These have provided hours upon hours of fun for my preschooler and his friends. Great for all ages. I even have fun with them. :-)	1
We love this set! The glow does not last for very long but otherwise they are great and even come with a small information sheet that gives you some fun fact about the different planets.	1
Bought for my science obsessed son. It is so cool. The planets are realistic. The stars glow. We had problems with the labels but in the end we glued them together on the string and it worked great.  Suggestions. Make sure the light is on 10 mins before bed to give the planets and stars a chance to charge. My son figures out that to get even brighter planets, take a flash light and hold it up to each planet. Takes on a few seconds for each one and they glow very bright for a long time. Definitely makes for a cool bedroom.	1
These were great. I bought it to use a few of the blue ones to make a Dalek costume for my daughter. The rest, I would throw into my pool when my kids were swimming. They made great pool toys.	1
They work great for my ball pit	1
These are great balls. I just wish the price was lower because you can never have enough balls lol.. we started out with a ball pit kiddie pool. And kept expanding now we have a rather large inflatable Intex pool that has taken over my son's room. This has been a great investment we have had for about 6 years. Great for winter time to keep the kids busy. We probably have about 1600 balls  at least in this pit of various sizes. These take up the most room so they are the best if your filling a big area.	1
Great for replacing balls, love them	1
These are great! I bought them to use for Christmas ornaments for my solar system obsessed 3 year old. They are well made and look nice. He never played with them, so I can't speak to their durability, but for ornaments, they were perfect!	1
These do not hold their shape of the 100 balls 3 came already smashed. And 2 weeks of infrequentuse by an 18 month old has left another 25-30 smashed. I would not buy again.	-1
Nice balls and nice feel to them with a bit of "give' not rock hard!	1
I bought it with GigaTent Action Play Tent and Tunnels and my kids and there friends still use it. Something to do on rainy days and easy to store away.	1
too thin, easy broke, but the price ok.	1
Good quality product. Nice, true size. Recommend.	1
These really do glow brighter than others. The star stickers are smaller than I expected as we high ceilings so all you can se is a glow can't tell what it is.	1
Easily breaks. Falls apart on its own	-1
Bought this for my 7 year old niece who loves all things space. She said it was a good weekend project.	1
My son is obsessed with these.	1
This item went perfectly with my son's bedroom space theme decor. We had purchased planet, space shuttle, and satellite decals for the walls, glow in the dark stars for his ceiling, a large astronaut decal, star projector, and of course a bedspread, but something was still missing. This little solar system gave the room a pop that it was lacking. Granted, it's not the most amazing quality I have ever seen, but it's lightweight enough to hang easily, the colors are very pretty, and the planets are a good size. I also like the star-shaped thumbtacks that were included. The stickers that come with this set aren't anything to write home about, but I wasn't concerned about that. Overall, I am extremely happy with this product!	1
spot on spot on	1
Hoping my son will love this. I know I do	1
The size bigger than I thought but that's even better cause my 16 mo son love it	1
Great price, my baby loved playing with them.	1
Fun	1
Very cool product. My son is obsessed with planets and this was a huge hit	1
This kit looks amazing up and had everything you need to hang it up. I could only give it 4 stars though, because it doesn't include a sun, my son really wishes it had a sun. Other than that it is amazing. The kit came with clear string, sticky tack, and cute clear star shaped push pins to hang up the planets. Also included was name tags for the planets, instructions, and glow in the dark stickers to stick up. The stickers have stars, shooting stars, circles in multiple sizes and some planets. We used the biggest circle to put up next to the earth to make a moon and all the other circles to make the asteroid belt; then dispersed the rest of the stars about. One other issue I had was that Mercury did not have a hook to hang it on the ceiling, so we had to break Pluto then super glue Plutos hook onto Mercury. I'm sure we could have just returned it and got a new one, but it only took 30 seconds and my son didn't want Pluto up anyway. It's been up a couple of months now and nothing has fallen down and look like they did the day we put them up. Would definitely recommend.	1
Cute and made our 7 year old very happy.  I wish I had glued all the bottoms on becasue several of them have separated and gotten lost.  They don't glow very well.	1
My son loves them	1
I bought these and several other brands or balls to put on my trampoline for my nieces and nephews to play in. Of all the balls I bought these are the toughest. They hold up better than the others and none of these were smashed. The kids play with these all the time and can jump around on the trampoline for hours. I also filled a blow up pool with these for the smaller kids to play in and everyone enjoyed that, including some of the adults. I will be ordering more of these for our next party. We decided we need more on the trampoline!	1
The balls look just like the picture, but they are a little flimsy. I wrote a review earlier on a friends opinion of the balls without testing them myself. I think for toddlers they are fine. They dent easily, but still bounce back because they are filled with some sort of foam. I would buy them again and I bought 300	1
Great! Perfect size, you would need at least 200 to fill a ball pit. Brightly colored and I aven't noticed a smell or dents. Gets the job done!	1
The stars are just stickers and they are hard to get off the sheet, but the planets are so cool, nice and bright for our daughter to gaze at as she drifts off to sleep.	1
Too hard to out up	-1
These were perfect to hang in my sons room:)	1
Just what I needed for the bounce house portion of our obstacle course. The colors are vibrant. They came in 16 yellow, 16 red, 16 orange, 18 green, 18 purple, and 18 blue. They work perfectly with the color scheme of any of the colored field day activity sets you would normally find. Also very, very durable.	1
Nice amount of balls, very colorful, great size and weight for my little one to hold and play with. Comes with great carry / store case.	1
Not the cheapest but the best!  We needed two packs to fill our small baby pool.  BRIGHT colors and way better quality than another set we found at Wal-Mart.  Spend the extra money if you care about having better look/quality balls.	1
My daughter received a Minnie Mouse ball pit for her birthday.  There were not enough balls so I purchased these to fill it up.  They are indeed quite large (bigger than the other ones), very colorful, and seem durable.  None of ours were squished or dented and remain that way after a week of play.	1
I bought two packs of these, and have mixed results. Both bags did contain 100 balls and they are pretty big for little toddler hands, so definitely a plus. However one bag was filled with balls that are weak and dents easily... Not sure why. The other bag is filled with balls that are sturdy and not easily dented. Either way these are super fun in a bounce house and/or baby pool. My toddler loves them!	1
I bought this for my 5th grade classroom and my students love it!  What a great way to teach about the solar system.	1
PERFECT!!!!  Forget all the reviews you've seen.  I am super picky and this was the absolute best deal I found and well worth it.  I bought 2 packages totaling 200 balls.  The balls are larger size like you would see at McDonalds or Sonic playground, they are soft enough for your baby but tough enough for older kids.  They did NOT smell like others mentioned and they are SAFE for your kids.  My boy just turned 2 year's old and loves them!!!  See the pics, I show the small pool with both 1 package (100 balls) & 2 other pictures showing 2 packages (200 balls) - one with the same pool and the other with a slightly larger bouncy castle.  I was very hesitate based on some of the low reviews but I will buy more in the future.  The packaging was FAST (Amazon Prime isn't always 2 days for me but these were on time for his 2 year old party).  My kind just loves rolling in them, not enough to get buried but enough for fun.  A+	1
I purchased a few different brands in different sizes for my kiddos ball pit. These by far were the best. Well worth spending a couple extra dollars. Plus, fast shipping. Thank you.	1
Love it	1
They are actually real size, not mini. Which is oddly hard to find. I had purchased from two other sellers and ended up with super small 1.5"ish balls. These are easily double the size and I even went back and purchased 500 more after my initial 200. My daughter loves her ball pit so money well spent!	1
Have lasted 5 years we still have them in our basement toy room for when friends bring there young ones to play	1
Bought this for my son's 3rd birthday. He was nuts about our solar system, knew all the planets, dwarf planets and would use his plastic ball pit type balls to represent the planets. I decided to look for some he could play with and saw that some people said they were pretty durable. They are for sure! Never hung them up on the string, my son just played with them in bed or on the floor. They don't glow for very long though, Maybe if you let them charge for like a day they would, but my son wouldn't wait that long lol his birthday was in December and it's now August and they are still in good shape. They aren't super thick plastic not super thin either. They don't look exactly like the planets, but they aren't that bad. My son, at 3 yrs old, could tell which planet was which. For the price, it's not that bad. If you want an exact replica, I would look for a paintable or more expensive version.	1
I bought two my Grandsons loved them!	1
Very cool.	1
I know this is going to sound extreme to some, but I did a lot of research and comparisons in trying to find the perfect ball pit balls for our children to play with for many reasons (which include the fact that these things are so darn expensive and I wanted something safe as kids are always pitting things in their mouth) . THESE ARE PERFECT!  PROS: 1. The size is absolutly perfect! They aren't too small so that you need hundreds to semi fill your space. And they are big enough that my baby's hands can still very easily grab and hold them. (I purchased the 3 1/8 size)  2. The material is non toxic and phthalate free.  3. The colors are vibrant and bold.  4. There are no holes in them which makes them less likely to crush AND makes lots if fun for the bath tub without worry of water and soap residue remaining in the ball.  Cons: 1. Price is higher (but COMELPLETELY worth the purchase in my opinion, for all of the pros I mentioned above)	1
I got these to add to my sons ninja turtle ball pit. While they were the perfect amount of balls, the quality isn't the best and most of them are already broken and crushed, some are paper thin, some a little thicker. But overall my one year old hasn't complained much.	-1
I have bought this product a couple time. Not because i didn't like it or it broke but because i love it. The glow of this company products is awsome! it bright vibrant colors but not too bright for little ones room. I have put them in my daughter son and nephews room over 2 years ago abd still havnt lost the glow.. This brought is great price and awsome prduct.	1
glows well after being exposed to natural light. The stickers that come with are sub par, but hey, they aren't why I bought the thing. It does not include the sun, but 8 planets plus Pluto. I plan on using my son's light fixture as the sun. The planets are indeed made of thin plastic, but that's because it's just not smart to hang heavy objects from your kid's ceiling. They hang well, just takes a bit of patience. You could also go to the hobby store, get two small dowel rods, and hang the planets from those for ease of installation and more security. I chose to glue the planets together to make them a bit stronger. For those worried about breaking, you could also stuff them with batting.	1
Looked really cool but the largest planet fell (due to unreliable knot tying skills) from ceiling to floor onto carpet and cracked, a three inch long split in the bottom half. They have been careful to not put any contact numbers on the box; I would be happy with a new planet but...	-1
Tons of fun for our toddler. We have used these in the tub, on the trampoline, and in his old pack and play (while we wait on his pool to come in)! We ordered 600 5cm, and 200 7cm. We would definitely recommend the larger 7cm!	1
Product as described! Great job. .. A+	1
They are what I expect. Not too crushable but not too hard! Great size too!	1
Gave to my gr-grandson for 2nd B.Day. Parents put them into the bounce house.  He loves them.  He's never met any kind of sports or play balls he didn't love.	1
Great quality!	1
Better then expected, large and thick plastic. Perfect	1
Helped with making a playful gift of the Big Bang Theory Sheldon Bazingz! T shirt	1
Even though you think 100 balls is a lot, I would recomend buying two if you have a little bounce house or a ball pit. The bag is great and a good amount for the price but when toddlers are concerned i don't think you can have enough. If you are looking to provide some extra fun for your kids these are good but you do spend forever cleaning up plastic balls if you plan to put them away after each use.....there are so many!	1
My grandson loved this for his birthday!	1
The Saturn which is my 5y/o favorite planet is already broken when he opened the pkg..the pkg did not come with the string, adhesive putty, am not sure what the tacks are. Everything you see in the picture is what I received. Will try to make do because I don't like the hassle of returning items. Glowed just a little. Cheap plastic too but I wasn't expecting anything more. The Uranus is the broken one..he had put the Saturn ring around it as shown in the picture	-1
Product seemed to be in heat to long. The stickers with the names of the planet were hard and the name flaked right off.	-1
keeps my child entertained for hours- we filled his pack and play with it to play in!	1
This is a giant bag of plastic balls. They are soft and colorful as pictured.... Not sure what to say about this product because it is what it is. We used them to fill a play pen... Actually we bought 3 bags and it was a good amount. They are very easy to clean... We filled the bathtub with warm soapy water to clean them and it worked great.	1
Kids loved it in their pool. Held up to the kids playing with them for hours on end. Very happy with the product. Received them when expected from the seller.	1
Theses are really cool, easy to hang up and all and they glow which my two sons love..makes any room look way cooler	1

good quality	1
Good product	1
We set up the solar system last night and my son was thrilled. It glowed really well and my whole family loved it.  My son usually sleeps with a nightlight plus his door open so he can have hallway light coming in. He happily shut off all the lights and shut the bedroom door so he could enjoy the glow in the dark better.  I don't think the stars were too tiny and none have peeled off so far.  The look of the 3D planets at night is awesome.  On the negative side, the string is slippery so it was hard to tie it onto the planets and thumbtacks. We easily stuck the thumbtacks into the ceiling.  The planets are a bit cheap looking but the kit is not that expensive so we got what we paid for.  We did drop Pluto and it cracked but we can fix it with crazy glue so be careful while hanging them up.  We are happy with our purchase and would recommend it to others.  I hope this will help my son want to go to bed earlier too :o)	1
Excellent balls for our bounce house.	1
Great Product!	1
My 3 year old LOVES these planets. I thought they were incredibly easy to put up. They have a nice glow to them. My son is completely fascinated by them and his imagination and interest in planets, stars and everything space has exploded. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. As far as the star stickers, we didn't put them up since he already had much larger glow in the dark stars and a moon on his ceiling. I figure he can use them on paper or other places later. The planets make a perfect addition to his room.	1
kids insisted on on putting it up right away! It also goes great with the solar system book!	1
These looks great and look really cool, glow nicely, we have had them for about 2 months now. They look awesome, only issue I had is I couldn't tell what order to put them in and there was no description of what each globe was and ended up putting them into a random order. I had no idea which planet was what I confessed to my kid, but they do look cool.	1
Got these as a gift for a space themed birthday party. They were a hit!	1
my 1 year old loves it	1
12 month old loves these in her pack-n-play!	1
These balls are great! My 8 month old son loves them and we have had them for 3 months. His older brother (9) goes rough on them and they seem to be holding up great. None of my balls came smashed and I have had no problems with them, even with the older kids jumping in the balls.	1
You can squeeze these with no effort. My 5yo is not very rough. Her and a couple 2lb.baby ferrets play with these and several are collapsed.	-1
I might need 500 balls to fill her little pool thingy but we love these. Big enough, soft enough... Perfect.	1
Good complete set. I am giving it 4 stars bc the stickers included that have the planets names on them, wipe off. Yep, the letters wipe right off. So don't even try putting the names on the balls. However, the parts are all included and it was very easy to hang. So overall a good set.	1
A neat addition to groom the creativity of a young mind. The solar system and stars are great. What kid doesnt want to turn off their light, look up and pretend they are traveling through space? Its also a great alternative to a night light.	1
This solar system set was a huge hit with my son.  He received them for Christmas and he immediately wanted them hung over his bed.  They are very accurate depictions of all the planets and look very neat both in the light and when the glow in the dark.  They have inspired my son to ask lots of questions about each planet and learn more about them.  I would absolutely buy these again!	1
my kid loves it! :D	1
These are far to small to be planets. Cheap. Not a fan.	-1
Ok so my girlfriend wanted to get some pit balls for a dog party.  We ordered 200 2.5 inch and 100 3.5 inch.  We did a lot of research and reading reviews.  We decided to go with these because of price and prime shipping option.  For the price there not bad but soon as my dog puts them in his mouth they cave in and do not go back to shape.  I know that's not what these are meant for but hoping they were a little stronger.  They will be fun for a few uses but soon most will be recycled as they won't last.  They have a chemical smell but that's pretty normal I think with these types of Chinese made balls.  You get what u pay for but good if your looking for cheap price and prime shipping.  Made it in time for party.  Review update:  Its been over a week of this ball pit set up inside my house.  Im not sure if it the play pin making me sick or if its the balls themselves.  They both are giving off a chemical smell still and I have had really bad headaches.  Everyone in my house has been off.  Dog throwing up etc.  To bad he loved playing in them.  I never get headaches either.  If this is for outdoor use maybe but not indoors.	-1
Product is what i expected. Not top of the line but adequate for our purposes and my 4yr old LOVES them. They larger planets require popping together, much like a plastic easter egg fits together. They are relatively light and hanging was not an issue. The paint job is rather cheap looking but again you pay for what you get. We did not use the labels on each planet and from our ceiling height (9ft) we wouldn't of really been able to clearly see them i suspect. The stars sticker sheet that comes with the package is a joke though! There are a lot of them which is great, but they are tiny and not cut very well. It is next to impossible to pick them off the sheet. No doubt the 4 I managed to tear off will permanently be adhered to the ceiling. I ditched the rest of them. They do glow pretty brightly but it does not last too long. Overall i'm okay with my purchase, my son is enjoying them and the price was right for me. 4 stars for a crappy sticker sheet.	1
Had them hung up in about ten minutes. Fun	1
What a great kit for my 5 year old son to have hanging in his room. He asked a ton of questions about the planet's, and was very involved with putting them together. They do glow when you turn the lights off, but sadly it doesn't last very long.	1
junky-- ended up buying a much better (and more expensive) solar system mobile.	-1
My niece and nephew had so much fun playing with these!  We put them in a tent and crawled through them.  This kept them busy for at least an hour.  I only wish I had purchased another set.	1
my daughter love it	1
They are just what we wanted! Going to be tons of fun for along time.	1
Good	1
very good quality!	1
I put this in my son's room.  He loves it.	1
Just what I needed.	1
Works	1
This is absolutely fabulous for my space-obsessed 6 year old son... but one problem: It didn't come with any kind of diagram to show how the solar system is layed out, so we had no idea in what order to hang the planets. My son's okay with that now but I have a feeling one day he's going to insist on us doing all kinds of research to lay them out accurately.	1
My kids are crazy about these balls.	1
These were a nice addition to our Jump O Lene Transparent Ring Bounce. I believe, 100 balls are sufficient for a standard size ring bounce. I found best price on Amazon for these, so, bought them. Will recommend this you have a ring bounce.	1
Perfect for our shark water slide and jump house	1
good	1
Great...	1
I measured distances between planets and hang them in the house in distance scale. My son was 1 year old when I did. For many nights we just kept telling goodnight to each planet. And the rocky planets fit all in his room.  They glow  for a long time after the light is off.. He knows all the planets at 3 and now we tell him stories about each planet. This was one of the most amazing purchases. It made me realize how amazing is the sole system.	1
Hung this from my daughters ceiling. It has been up a year and is just as awesome as the day we put it up.	1
Love this set! My son loves the planets and this solar system is super cool.	1
My son loves these and they are still glowing strong after a year.	1
my grandson loved it	1
Put these in a 36" baby pool for an indoor ball pit for our son when he was 6-18 months old. He had THE best time in the pool with the balls, throwing them, & diving in & out of the balls. Money well spent. Wish we'd thought of it when our older kids were babies. The reason for only 4 stars is that a few of the balls were poorly made & thin making them collapse & be crushed. We had to throw out about 5 of them.	1
This goes with the jump o lene that I purchased.  Put all of the balls inside for more fun.	1
It's all good	1
I purchased this set for my 3 1/2 year old daughter and she loves them! I've been teaching her about the planets and these are a great learning tool and a hands on way to learn about the planets. After using these a few times, she's able to identify each planet. In the set you get the 8 main planets, Pluto, and a sheet of 200 glow in the dark star/comet stickers. The planets are not exactly to scale, but they are mostly accurate in their sizes relative to each other; for example, Venus and Earth are often called twin planets because they are about the same size and in the set, they are the same size. Also, Jupiter is the largest planet and is the largest in the set.  While I think that these make a great teaching tool, there are quite a few things that could use improvement. First of all, the planets are made of flimsy, thin Easter egg plastic, so when my daughter tries to open and close the few planets that open, I'm always worried she's going to crack one of the halves. Also, the center of the entire solar system, the Sun, is NOT included! I find that so disappointing, especially if you are going to hang them from the ceiling and want to create an accurate model of the solar system. The colors of the planets are mainly accurate, although Uranus is an odd purple color with spots, when in reality it is supposed to be a pale blue color. I do like the detailing on some of the planets, such as Jupiter's lines and red spot. I am disappointed in the Saturn planet because the ring will NOT stay on it - it keeps falling off even when I popped open the planet to insert the thin ring around the edges and tried to close it between the two halves.  I do like that you can hang these from the ceiling, but in order to do that, the instructions state you have to use adhesive putty or tack the string into the ceiling. Because she may not be interested in these for too long, I chose not to put holes in the ceiling and also because she likes to hold them as we are talking about them. The other selling point of these planets is that they glow in the dark. Based on the item photos, I thought these would glow really bright, but unfortunately, they glow pretty faintly. I also find it disappointing that the planets do not come labeled. Unless the parent is savvy about the solar system, it may be hard for a child to tell which planets are which. Lastly, the stickers that come with it are very cheap and nearly impossible to peel off the sheet! I ended up ripping lots of them in trying to get my nail under the edge to peel it up, so we just threw them away.  It seems as though there are more cons than pros to this set quality wise,  but my daughter does love it and they make the planets more real to her than just looking at pictures of them.	-1
These are SO cool! My son loves them. The stars included are just stickers, but they do glow brightly.	1
The planets are of poor quality and the planet labels are easily erasable.  There aren't really 250 items as 241 are little glow-in-the-dark stickers.  I accidentally dropped Jupiter and it shattered into three pieces.  There's also no sun.  It should really read "3-D Planets + Pluto"  I also purchased the Wonder Stars Super Kit, which I thought was of much better value, and better priced than this one.  The two should be closer in price.	-1
Kids love this. One gripe was with the instructions. They give you a ton of fishing line with which to hang the models, but they say to only use two feet of it?! Wouldn't make sense, especially if you want to get a feel for the perceived distances of each planet, etc. We used the line to extend it about ten feet across the main wall of our sons' room. The provided tacks work well, and assembly is overall quite easy.	1
Great buy!	1
On-time delivery,soft and durable balls. Kids love them very much.	1
Good thanks	1
These were a home run with the kids, use them for dry ball pit or kiddie pool	1
Good quality balls, just as advertised.  I filled a medium sized kid pool 9about 5ft in diameter, about 1ft or less deep) with 300 balls (so 3 sets) and it was perfect for all the kids at my daughter's birthday party (ages 1.5 to 10)	1
Perfect for our home. I squeezed them pretty hard and they spring right back to their original shape. So far they are holding up, even with our ten and twelve year old who can't stop throwing them at each other. :)	1
every kid loves balls.  these are great and worth the money.  have been playing with them since the abby could grasp things	1
My kids love it.	1
Love these!	1
Excellent product and service, very satisfied!	1
I was not very impressed, I imagined they would be bigger then what they were. I never even hung them up. They are so small you would not even notice them hanging from a ceiling .	-1
This is a perfect item for children who love space.  My grandson is really into space and loves these	1
great	1
My grand son loves these.  They are attached to his ceiling, he told me how to position them !!  The 'putty' that is provided made it easy and they are still up there after all this time, even though they are touched occasionally since he's on the top bunk.  Very durable and attractive.	1
I really like this solar system, and so does my son. It's hanging up over his bed, in his awesome outer space room. The planets are on the smaller side, but still fine for our purposes, and you can clearly tell the differences among the planets, and which planet is which.  Some other reviewers have complained that the planets don't glow very brightly, but we have found the amount of glow to be perfect. We use these in a kid's room, and don't want something that is going to light up the room at night. They glow brightly enough to see them clearly, and the glow lasts for a few hours (I know. I have a little kid. I'm sometimes in and out of his room for hours trying to get him to go to sleep.). I wouldn't want them any brighter than they are.	1
I bought these to supplement an inflatable pirate ship that only came with 10-20 plastic balls. It looked pretty lame so I decided to purchase this set to fill up some of the space. These were perfect and really make the pirate ship a lot more fun for my niece to play in. She loves jumping into them and throwing the balls around.  None of them have been dented or crushed, yet the plastic is not so hard that it would hurt if you got hit in the head with it. Very pleased with this product.	1
I used these for a ball pit I made for a birthday party and they really are crushproof. Great price for them too!	1
Very nice, although I remain a doubt, then buy two equal packets and a packet saying that for ages 3 years and the other said from 2 years. It's something strange for me is the same product. Although my son is not yet two years is a lot of fun with these balls. Only by detailed age do not give five stars.	1
Great price and great quality.  The kids loved playing with the balls and there was no worry of them doing so in the house since the balls are soft enough not to hurt anything when thrown.	1
Ordered this for my great grandson for his birthday and he loves it.	1
So cool...my grandson loves it!	1
this is so nice looking in our sons bedroom. he loves it an they glow .great for all kids . and adults,,,lol	1
These have two uses at our house 1 - Put them in the kiddie pool for the little ones to play with 2- Put them in the play pen for the little ones to play with Either way, water or no water they are well worth it.	1
My Grandkids are 4, 3, & 2 1/2 now and they still are enjoying them.  All of the boys as soon as they could sit up & crawl have enjoyed them in a small kids pool (without the water of course).  I keep it set up in a play area that is all soft for them to dive in.	1
Purchased these to fill a baby pull for my young one. He enjoyed throwing them at me, which was fine because they are lightweight and don't really pose much of a hazard.  They are thin plastic which might not appeal to some, but for me it was perfect because mine is still young.	1
I got this for my grand daughter for her 1st birthday to go with the ball pit.  She LOVES balls!	1
this is great outdoor fun for all the kids when they come for parties.  It is always a hit a my house.	1
bought these with a small blow up kiddie pool and my daughter loves her ball pit! she also loves to throw these balls and learn to catch and throw!	1
The are very cool and fun for a kid.  I just wished they looked more realistic is all.  But the kids do love them.	1
Gave as a gift. My grand-son wanted them hung as soon as he opened them!	1
The planets are of a good size that looks really neat hanging in our DS6's space-themed bedroom.  It comes with sticker labels of the planet names, but we opted to leave these off (Black with white lettering.) The only downer was I was expecting decent sized glow stars to complete the looks.  These were micro-mini (and I mean micro) stickers that looked better suited for a dollhouse.  Not sure what we'll even use those for, if anything.  Overall, VERY pleased with the look of the planets hanging from the celling!  The orbit has taken over the entire area of our DS's room. We have the room light that is in the corner of his room as the "sun" and a Milton Moon that lights up on the wall next to his bed.  So cool!	1
These are great quality and my kids loved them!  They are very colorful and has provided hours of fun at our house.	1
These are very nice for the price. Very colorful and balls all retain their shape very well. Nice size for my kids to play with them in the ball pit.	1
Bought these to fill up my little 1 year olds ball pit. They are perfect in size and not cheap. He loves them!	1
Fun...not as durable as I would have liked but very nice decoration.	1
brought 2 sets---kids love them.gets their imagination going and pretty easy to set up. don't let the kids knock them once its up---push pin goes flying.	1
Each planet holds tight. Detailed manual really helps to place the planets in the correct order and distance. My son loves seeing its glow in the dark.	1
These were easy to put up, come with some extra information, and are cute in the room. My daughter irritated that Neptune is mostly purple instead of blue, though.	1
ok	1
Just the right amount for a 2 year old. Great fun, easy to pick up and stow away. Hours of fun. Not too soft not too hard. Just right highly recommend	1
Perfect for the kids room	1
Looks great in the dark with a black light.	1
Not very high quality at all. Bought to make a mobile for baby and the colors are off, planets are not sized to scale, etc...	-1
Awesome 3 dimensional glow in the dark plants, and they didn't leave out Pluto! My son loves staring at these as he goes to bed!	1
A lot of balls for a lot of fun & laughter. My kids love them & we filled their tent with it at times.	1
Well, its been a year... These balls were a Christmas gift last year and I can say that over the year, they really held up.  We bought them for a pop up tent (loved the tent... you know, the hexagon one) and we used the balls in the basement.  In general...  PROS... - they are lightweight, so when the kids throw them, no one gets hurt - they are not crushproof.  I can easily crush the with my hands...BUT... they do return to shape easily. - they don't seem to break at the seems (we didn't get any broken ones either). - the colors are bright and pretty cheery - great carrying case... that thing has been used over and over this year and it still works... I wasn't expecting that. - nice size... these are pretty big, so they cover a good deal of area.  Be careful of the cheaper balls that are sometimes smaller... it will take more balls to fill a space if you get the smaller balls....  CONS - they aren't the same quality as the ones you find in commercial facilities.  They are just a bit too thin to be that durable.  If your kids are older or bigger, you may want to get balls that are a bit more sturdy. - 100 balls isn't enough.  No really... whatever you want to do with these balls, you probably need more... one bag is just never enough.	1
this was gift for my 10 year old..she loves it we hung them up all over her ceiling.	1
changed my review after using it...  upon opening it it was neat! but now that we are learning about space and using it... I'm bummed. two of my loops were broken, and the stickers which make up 200 of the 209 pieces, aren't cut properly. So i can just peel and stick. If i want to use them i have to cut them myself :/ not happy.....	-1
We have these in my sons nursery and he loves them and so do we	1
Item came quickly and as described. My toddler has tons of fun playing with these balls and thankfully they are lightweight, so we've had few accidents.	1
My kids love them...I placed them in a pool and keep it in their playroom so they can play with them whenever they want.	1
We got this when my baby was about 8 months, and it's been 3 months and he still loves it! For smaller babies, all they would do is grab it and put it in their mouth, so wipe thoroughly before giving it to them. When the baby gets a little older, they would grab these balls with both hands and bump them into each other to make sounds. With each developmental age, the babies would play with these balls differently. You can put these balls into a plastic container or inside a play tent. My baby even puts this into the ball popping dinosaur toy. I would say it's a good buy!	1
Grand baby LOVES this toy. HAPPY happy happy happy happy She plays with this everyday and smiles from ear to ear.	1
Little pricey for balls but we needed to fill our little toddler ball pit. They are a little bigger than the balls that came with the pit but he still likes to throw them around for mommy to pick up.	1
I never have issues with the balls. All accounted for and neatly stored in a nice bag for transport purposes. Goes great with my bouncehouse. I do have trouble collecting them to put away, but thats a given...	1
after receiving these balls i was concerned that it didn't state Phthalate free on the packaging and it said only ages 3+ (probably because they contain Phthalates and small children put toys in their mouths).  It took me for ever but I managed to get ahold of the manufacturer and he told me that they in fact DO have Phthalate in them, its just a very small amount.  Amazon really screwed up with this, its a very important piece of information to be wrong about and I'm extremely upset that I have to mail them back and order something else!	-1
Two stars. We liked it ok....but where is the sun?? You know the star that is the center of our universe? I could look past that....almost but then I had a hard time figuring out which one was supposed to be Earth. Um, kind of a big deal since pretty much most preschoolers know what Earth looks like. anyway, they glow dimly and we are still going to hang them even though I had to superglue some of them to get them to stay together. I would say it's an ok beginner set for a kids room. If you want something for a teen or have a space nut kid I'd pass on this one.	-1
I added these balls to a 100 I already had and my 2 year old loves playing with them in the pack n play.	1
Amazing! I wish I could take a picture. We lay on our sons floor and its just beautiful. Wonderful glow.	1
100 balls sound like alot but its not if your thinking of buying these two or three hundred is ample, come in a awesome carry bag and seem durable plus my child seems to love them.	1
Many of the other reviewers spoke of receiving dented or out-of-round balls, but I decided that, for the price & the purpose (a ball pit), that wasn't a deal-breaker.  As it turned out, of the 2 sets I purchased (200 balls total) NONE were dented or oddly shaped!!!  Woohoo!  So far they've even held up to my 9 mo. old grandson's attempts to "eat" them (he has 6 large & sharp teeth!).  Also, 200 was just the right amount for a 4' pool.  Addendum (3 mos later):  Still no dented balls!  And that's after 3 mos of my 4 yo granddaughter leaping into the ball pit onto the balls every time she comes over.  Some are becoming softer, but that's the only change I've noticed in the 3 mos.	1
I purchased this pack of balls to go into an inflatable ball pit that I purchased for my 2 year old daughter that didn't have enough included, and I am so glad I purchased these. This pack of balls fit perfectly into her ball pit and she loves them! They are a little bigger than I thought they'd be but they really do work wonderfully with her ball pit. Also, the colors are really bright and vibrant, and these have really helped her with learning her colors.	1
Hmm, I know there are many jokes that you can go about this but I guess this is as advertised. They're plastic balls for a ball pit or whatever creative avenue you want to take with them. I used them in an inflatable pool and made a ball pit for my 1 year old. The balls are larger than I expected but that doesn't take away from the fun????!!! LOL	1
Perfect for space themed room for my 3 and 7 year old boys.	1
My preschooler is obsessed with the solar system.  My sister gave this to him for Christmas and when he opened it he was ecstatic.  Definitely his favorite gift this year. I was impressed with the product, especially after seeing the price.  I would have paid about $10 - 15 more than list price. They are plastic and some planets need to be snapped together similar to a plastic easter egg.  The rest of the planets are one piece, similar to a ping pong ball.  The plastic is thin and the larger ones that need to be snapped together seem like they could easily break.  Since these will be hanging on the ceiling, it shouldn't be an issue. The tacks that the come with the set are thick and most likely would be very painful to step on.  I liked another reviewers idea to put one of the glow in the dark stickers on the tack so that it could easily be found if dropped. Yes, they do glow.  My son had a hard time getting use to the glow the first night and it kept him up pass his bedtime because he kept asking for us to take it down.  The next night he was fine and wanted to talk about the planets before he went to bed. It does come with a little handout that has a few facts about the planet and a diagram of the planets that gives you a visual idea of how far the planets are from each other.  If you want to hang the planets the correct distance from each other you will have to do some research.  We chose to do it visually only because it would take some time to calculate the distance based off the size of each of the plastic planets. The set says that it comes with 209 pieces.  That would be 200 stickers which come on a small 8 by  5 1/2 sheet.  They are very small and cheap looking.  We decided to skip putting these on the ceiling and will instead use them for crafts. Even with the cheap stickers, this set is a great value. It is an educational toy and if your child isn't interested in the solar system, this would be a great way to peak their interest. I	1
Daughter loves it	1
I put 600 of these into a Intex blow up kids pool in my play room for the kids. They are great. I'll Admit i got in the ball pit too with the kids to play and the balls did not smash.	1
the balls are wonderful for kids, very colorful, light, they float, would buy this product again with out any hesitation	1
I purchased the to fill my granddaughters Minnie Mouse ball pit. She has had hours and hours of fun with these and never tires of playing with them.  they have withstood lots of wear and now her cousin has expressed a wish for a ball pit of her own. Not sure they are sturdy for 8yr old but great for the 1yr old	1
Will purchase more of these. I purchased these for the kids bouncy house and will purchase more. The kids have a great time with these and with the storage bag, clean-up is simple. They are durable.	1
Bought this to go in my toddlers bouncy castle. Yes a few balls may crush but overall they are really good and for this price what more can you expect. they do not smell bad at all and she loved them to bits. They are really meant to be played with in something soft or a ball pit not hard floor where if stood on they will be crushed. Overall great product.	1
Gave this as a gift to a young boy and he loved them. No sharp edges like I've found on other bags of balls.	1
I got these to fill up a ball pit for my toddler. It was enough to fill up a 2 kid sized ball pit. They do tend to crush but I would expect that when you have a toddler going crazy on them.	1
Balls are pretty thin plastic so I'm not sure they could hurt even if most adults threw them with all their might. One bonus is that there are no air holes so I have used them not only in the ball tent but also in the bath since they won't suck up water and get moldy inside. Planning on buying another hundred soon to finish off the ball pit.	1
I was provided with this product in exchange for a review but opinions are my own.  My children love this solar system and how it glows!  The planets are made very well and I loved how we could hang them however we wanted (straight line, group, etc.). At first we were confused which planet was which since some look very similar, but the symbols on the bottom of each planet allowed us to match them to the paper diagram.  I didn't expect the extra educational info on the planets, so that was a nice surprise.	1
My son LOVES this on his ceiling! Knocked off a star because I wish they would provide a better detailed way to hang the planets. Also, the stars included in this package are just tiny stickers. You're better off purchasing additional glow in the dark stars.	1
Nice quality balls that are great for a ball house. They are soft enough to be thrown or played with in the house and not break anything, yet they are strong enough to be put in a ball house and with stand being bounced on and played with. Nice bright colors too!	1
My little one likes these. They are soft enough to play with or hold. There are so many and the colors are bright.	1
Great price, seems to be sturdy and safe. Purchased this for my son's 2 year birthday party for guests to play in. Great quality.	1
This was a great buy.  It does take some effort to assemble and install but it is worth it.  My kids have done away with their night lights as a result.  The little sticker stars may look flimsy but they really do flow quite brightly.  I have now bought 2 more to give as gifts to other kids.	1
Xmas gift for playroom!!!	1
This is a very cool kit. My toddler son was very excited to get this and he now points the planets out by name. They look really neat in the dark and in the light. The only con was that we have popcorn ceilings and these are nearly impossible to install in that type of ceiling. I had to make a mount for around his fan and get creative with how I hung the others. Good luck and enjoy!	1
Balls were delivered dented.  This was a gift for my 8 month old niece.  My sister texted a picture to me right out the package and almost all of them were dented.  This was not worth the money.	-1
OH gosh this is too much balls in my house I had to put some away. at one point my 1 yr old threw it all around the house. I had to throw some away because i stepped on it & it smashed it. once it's smash there's no ball, just a flat plastic. My son loves it. I just think the 100 of them was too much.	1
These are great, much more affordable than the ones they sell at Toys R Us and just as fun! My daughter loves rolling around in her blow up ball pit.	1
The planets are alright, not at all to scale...  The star and comet stickers are not that good...  Good purchase for little kids, but I'd like to see a scale solar system available....  I'd buy it in a heart beat...	1
this balls are so big for ball pool. and easily crushed..also smell was so strong. I will not buy again.	-1
I agree with the reviewers who've said these balls have inconsistent quality.  I've bought three of these bags for a homemade wading-pool ball pit.  The first two bags were full of nice, firm balls that would only dent if you tried to squish them hard with your thumb.  I then ordered the third bag, and its balls are completely different -- the plastic on one or both halves is soft and flimsy and dents when the ball simply lands on something.  I'm actually worried that some of the balls will end up tearing.  I was very pleased with the first two bags but am considering returning the third -- so, caveat emptor.	1
We've had this set for several years now and it's going great.  They glow almost all night long and they're  fun to look at in the daylight too.  The coloring on them is great and they're easy to install.	1
ok	1
If you are looking for crush prove balls, these are not the balls to buy.  Don't bother buying these...they get crushed very easily!	-1
Bigger that the balls you get at walmart. Just like the ones in a professional ballpit. My kids love them and they are holding up.	1
They really glow and for a substantial time after turning out the lights.  I've had others that weren't this quality.  I highly recommend these ones!	1
Great thing to get for ball pits that only come with a few balls. This is the 2nd set I have gotten, one from a store for my own daughter and I just bought this set here online for my friends son. She says her son loves the balls and the ball pit so can't ask for anything more.	1
I ordered it under Prime for 2nd day, and was surprise that it came in next day!  I have been searching for large sized ball pit balls to add to my 300+ intex and M.M.T.L. brand balls that I purchased from thrift stores. Yes, not all balls are uniform in thickness. Some thicker, some thinner but that doesn't bother me. I'm sure a competitor named CMS already explained in many of his responses to other negative comments about Intex balls.  I am looking for exact same balls and am glad I found them. If you want to fill up a ball pit deep enough for your toddler  to jump in, this is great!  The excitement and smile on my son's face makes this product priceless! I will buy more to fill it up even higher as he grows.  If you have mishapped balls, try put them in a big pot and pour hot water on them. Someone suggested hair dryer.	1
Perfect addition to our Active Play 3 in 1 Gym Set ball pit!  We purchased 2 of these and it was a great amount at a great price!	1
Our kids love things that glow in the dark and anything to do with space.  WIN!  This is an awesome little set.  Sturdy for ceiling (probably not for play).  Works perfectly in conjunction with glowing star stickers (also sold on Amazon).	1
This was a little more complicated than I first thought, but time will tell as the children grow up. It was just as promised.	1
Hi - we bought these balls to go along with a inflatable bounce house for my 2 year old son. These are safe and durable enough to withstand a 6, 3, and 2 year old children. Nothing too complicated, if you want a bunch of safe plastic balls for hours of enjoyment then I highly recommend.	1
The planets have nice colors, my son likes looking at them above his bed. Getting them all hanging and attached to the ceiling was quite a job. It took me quite a while with the putty, the tacks, a hammer, the string.... quite involved, and 2 planets have already fallen down and I don't plan on putting them back up!	1
I bought this for my grandson with a matching sheet set and glow in the dark comforter. This is a great bedroom dcor. My grandson enjoys exploring the solar system mobile. The delivery service was great.	1
I really love this kit and so do my kids.  I hung it up in their room and at night when they are going to bed we review the planets.  They had them all memorized within 2 nights of chatting about it and they glow in the dark so that makes it even more fun!  They are ages 5 and 9.	1
Glows bright and fosters an interest in the world around us. What more can you ask for? The planets come in two halves though but it doesn't affect their purpose.	1
I have a variety of different balls for my son's ball pit at home and these are well made and do not crush or peel apart like some of the other brands I've tried do.	1
My twin toddlers love these!  We dump them into an inflatable kiddie pool to make an impromptu ball pit.  They are a nice size -- big enough so that they don't roll under the couch, but not too big.  They do dent easily though and there isn't a way to pop the dents out.  You'll want to keep them away from dogs; ours has chewed up some of the balls.	1
I read reviews saying these balls are not hard enough but that is what sold me on them. I did not want some so hard my son could fall on them and get hurt. These will crush but they come right back out and are fine. I bought them to go with the megaland ball pit.	1
I would say 80% of the balls are smashed in. I personally consider this a complete waste of my money.  I would return but 4 year old daughter has been waiting for these since I ordered them and she has seen the package so I cannot really return them.	-1
These arrived really quickly.  The bag is convenient for storing the balls.  Love how many different colors the balls are.  My 21 month old is learning his colors now so these help.  Also fun for counting.  They seem a teeny bit larger than some play pit balls I've seen at stores but they are still really fun!	1
we got this for a birthday present for our five year old nephew.  he loves it!  his father does too!	1
Okay so this is really more like a 4.5 Star item, but the three year olds that I used this with to teach about Space ABSOLUTELY LOVED hanging a new planet each day and the "mini facts" (which was all their brains could hold while memorizing the planets) on the box.  The only thing is there is no Sun and no Moon ... thank God Christmas season had just ended so I scored a gi-normous gold bulb as my sun and we had a sparkling white bulb for our moon from the dollar store.  Even without the sun and moon this system is so worth it's value.	1
You can buy cheaper balls but they are generally smaller and less durable, so these are a good value for the volume. I underestimated how many I would need to make a decent ball pit.  If you plan to make a ball pit, plan on spending a minimum of a couple hundred bucks. The plastic odor faded with time, but I found it initially overwhelming in the house and moved the ball pit to the yard.  Balls in mesh packaging seem to have less plasticky fumes.	1
My son is very happy with this product!  I ended up hanging them on the wooden beams of the bunk bed so that whoever ends up on the bottom bunk that night gets to see them dangling above.  My only problems with this product is Saturn's rings come off too easily and I had to superglue some of them shut.  I know the colors aren't exactly right, Neptune and Uranus don't come with rings, and the colors aren't perfect, but even so, my son still loves it.	1
I decided to try these for my 4 yr old's room, despite the somewhat negative reviews. He loves learning about the planets, and also loves the glow in dark stars on his ceiling so I thought these would make a great addition. And they are wonderful!! We are so in love with them every night when the lights go out. The plastic is lightweight so they can easily hang from fishline, not necessarily cheap. Assembling the planets and stringing them to fishline is fairly easy. Tying a little loop on the other end to hang from the pin took a little patience, but not too bad. The star-shaped pins hold them securely to ceiling with no problem. The different colors and patterns make each planet glow brighter or dimmer, for a realistic touch. I will agree a downfall is the sheet of glow stars they include....they are TINY, could fit on my thumbnail. But they are great filler stars IF you buy some larger glow stars to fill the ceiling, and I highly recommend you do! The star sets made by Great Explorations & University Games are great, OR the jar of stars made by The Toysmith are great too - all available on Amazon. The key is to get sets with different size stars, it really makes your ceiling universe pop. I was so impressed by how amazing his room looked at night....that I bought another set of planets and large set of stars for OUR room (keep watch on these, as Amazon often puts them on sale - I got mine for $9.99 w/ free s/h!) And now I'm so in love with my nighttime universe, as much as my little boy! I look forward to gazing at it every night before my eyes quickly close on another exhausting wonderful day.	1
These are great and just as described. Can be used as educational tool also for learning colors and counting. Not so hard that if they are thrown they will break anything. Only setback is that they do crush easily and are very hard to get back to original form. If I had to purchase these again I would get ones that are crush proof.	1
Buyer beware: this is a large bag of colorful but POORLY MADE and VERY dented balls! The set we received had so many dents and were so misshapen that many won't even roll around. I thought I would give them a try despite the reviews because its so hard to find a safe set to use with kids.  Very disapointing.	-1
We've had these for many months now, and they have held up very well. Nothing too surprising in this review: they are durable, colorful, a good size for kids (roughly the size of a tennis ball). They are light and "give" a little bit when squeezed, which probably contributes to their toughness. Good value for the price.  Be aware that 100 balls may not be as much as you think. We have 200 balls and it doesn't seem to fill our small ball pit that well!	1
This was so awesome to put in our 5 yr olds room. It'd be great for any aged kid! Love it!	1
Bought this product for my five year old grandson who is an astrology nut. These are hanging from his bedroom ceiling and he loves them.	1
My son is going to be so excited to transform his bedroom into the solar system! This is a great gift for a young boy who love space!	1
At 24 I still really want to play in ball pits. However, they are rather hard to find for adults and places like Chuckie Cheese seem to frown on adults frolicking in theirs. So until I can convince my boyfriend to let me fill the closet with these play balls (and I will make it happen someday!), I will just have to live vicariously through my niece who has one of those little inflatable play areas made to go with these balls. I got her a bag of these balls and she loves them. They're the somewhat soft kind so if more than one child is playing parents don't have to worry about someone throwing a ball and the play date ending in tears.	1

I got these for my son who is almost a year old. I wanted something for him to play with. I just bought the one bag and put about half of them in his pack and play. He loves playing with them and banging them together. The balls arrived and none were dented. They were all in great shape and still are. I don't know how they will last when he gets rougher with them but I am pleased with my purchase. They really don't hold much educational value except for teaching colors but he likes playing with them. When he gets older and can play in there on his own I'll probably pick up another pack or two and make a true ball pit but for now he is happy with half a pack in his pack and play.	1
I ordered these to go with a ball pit that only came with a few balls in it. Works great!	1
neat and fairly accurate representation of the solar system.  would like it to have the sun in it, but still a good toy for a great price.  got a 4 because it would be better if it had the sun	1
I got this as a gift for my nephew and I think he'll absolutely love it! The planets are medium size and have awesome colors...I really think he'll love it!	1
My 4 yr old took a notice in the solar system. SO this was the best gift for him. He has it hanging from his ceiling in his room.	1
Bought this for my son's birthday 3 years ago.  It has been hanging from his bedroom ceiling ever since.  The star pushpins to hang the planets are neat.  We placed them in the correct scale, and they look awesome.  They still glow at bedtime, 3 years later.  I have to admit, it is a pain to get on a step ladder to dust them (a damp cloth works best) but they are worth it.  What a way to drift off to sleep!  Oh, and yay!  it includes Pluto.	1
My daughter enjoyed these so much we purchased them for a birthday gift for a friend.  Educational and fun.  Easy enough to hang and they included clear line to hang with.	1
I bought this 3D Solar System on a whim. It was on sale, and I thought the glow in the dark aspect might help cure my 3 year old boy of his fear of the dark. It arrived in the mail two days later and he was so excited to hang the planets up above his bed. Even my one year old was excited, chanting "Moon!" and "Ball!" over and over again. The kit comes with clear string and star shaped thumbtacks to push into the ceiling. It also comes with glow in the dark star stickers. The planets come with two labels each. We attached one label on the bottom of the planet, and one on the side. The labels peel off a pit over the months, and you'll have to press them back down every few months. My Son immediately started learning the names of each of the planets. I cut out a section of the back of the box that told a bit about each planet. For the next few weeks, he fell asleep every night with that piece of box clutched in his hand.  Since then, we've added to the planets. It includes pluto so we added four more dwarf planets: Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris; and we added a comet, space shuttle and asteroid belt.  Pros: Develops an interest in the Solar System. Everything you need to install is included. Durable, Educational, and Fun.  Cons: The stickers don't stick well. Pluto could be confusing. It's the only dwarf planet included, they should either take it out or add the other dwarf planets. The colors are a little off. Saturn is not that green, and neptune is more of a blue purple than a pink purple. There is no sun included, so you'll have to get creative with arranging the planets. We put a yellow circle on the wall, but I've heard of others arranging the planets around a ceiling light.	1
We bought my 9 month old son all kinds of different fun toys, and he only wants to play with these balls! I ordered 2 of these so I'd have 200 balls. When they arrived, I'd say 10-15% were dented. But really who cares, cause they're just gonna get dented anyway by your kids. We filled my son's Pack 'n Play with 200 of these and he just swims in them like in a ballpit!  Pros - Balls are bright and colorful. You can teach your kids colors. - Balls are big but super light, so my son is able to hold them with one hand! - Balls are soft (as they should be), so I'm not afraid of him getting hurt in his ballpit.  Cons - Balls dent easily, but it's easy to get them undented. It's because they're soft, but they're SUPPOSED to be soft! If they were hard, it defeats the whole purpose and safety of a ballpit. I really don't bother undenting them anymore cause they just get dented again and again. My son doesn't care and continues to have a blast anyway!  I plan to buy another 100 when he gets bigger to fill up his ballpit some more. Very happy mom to a VERY active baby, who plays happily for 30 minutes now in his ballpit!	1
This is a great product, easy to assemble and holds a good charge for a bit. I would recommend this to anyone with a space enthusiast in their life.	1
I agree with other reviews- these have a bit of inconsistency. A few of the balls are really thick but some are really thin and bend in easily. Most of them are a medium mix of the two. They are perfect for color recognition because they include ALL the colors. They are a good size for smaller hands.	1
I ordered these and a small pool for my grandson. I know he will have fun when he can sit up and play in the pile of balls.  The colors are so very bright and great for a little one.  You can already see how much he likes the bright colors in his picture.	1
Balls arrived quickly and my 17 month old loves them. She uses them for much more than just the ball pit.	1
These have been hanging in my son's bedroom for a couple of years now and still glow pretty well.  Pretty realistic renditions.	1
~BACKGROUND~ I purchased this as a gift for my 8 year-old son.  ~OVERVIEW~ 9 planets NO SUN ~25 feet of clear string (fishing line) 200 glow in the dark adhesive stars planetary guide book  ~PROS~ - It's educational which was most important to me. - It glows - not too bright which was perfect for us. - The tacks used to pin the planets to the ceiling are clear so they don't stand out. - The planets are well detailed and nicely colored.  ~CONS~ - NO SUN! - The fishing line used to hang the planets is challenging to tie to the planets. - The fishing line used to hang the planets is not of equal length, so you have to try to tie them to the planets equal. - The sticker stars are somewhat dim and can be challenging to peel and stick. - Not really a "fun" type of toy - hang it, look at it.  ~TIPS~ - Since there is no sun, use your ceiling light as the sun. - Set aside about an hour to set this up in it's entirety. - Sit at a table and assemble the planets and string first.  ~CONCLUSION~ We have had these up for several months and none have fallen.  They glow fairly bright after being exposed to light and slowly fade to a dim glow.  Overall we are pleased with this set.	1
We received this toy as a Christmas present for our two year old who loves anything space. Whoever design/manufactured this toy should be embarrassed. It is made with the cheapest plastic possible, the planets are painted in bizarre/inaccurate colors and the pieces fall apart very easily. They glow in the dark ok but there is no way I would ever hang such a lame toy in my son's bedroom.	-1
Purchased this to go along with Mega Playhut. I found that this was a good addition for added balls in the ballpit!	1
These are great!  Not a single on was dented or cracked and they have held up to some serious jumping and ball toss battles.  Good value for the money.	1
His only question/complaint was, "Where's the sun?!"  Also, he's determined to find a way to make the glow last longer.  But other than these two things, the kit is great!  He loves this!  We put it above his bed, so he goes to sleep each night looking at the planets.  The stickers are small, but really nothing to complain about.  The putty alone didn't help much.  After every planet fell down at least once, we realized we had to tie a knot around the tac then add putty then press into ceiling.  No biggie.  Great gift!	1
My son got this for Christmas and it is wonderful for teaching about the solar system in a fun way.  He loves how the planets hang over his bed and glow in the dark.	1
The only thing missing is the sun but they do glow in the dark. Could have been more clearly marked.	1
The planets were much nicer, more colorful and a tad larger (nice!!!) than I expected them to be. I bought these along with the Uncle Milton's Moon in my Room for my 5 year old nepew. We haven't opened the product because it was his christmas gift, but I was able to shine light on the planets through the packaging and they did glow well in the dark. I didn't really see how long they retained their glow because I fell asleep...lol. Very cool, I expect he will get many nights of enjoyment from his nightime friends. I will update the review should any problems with the product arise. So far, I am well pleased with my purchase!	1
We bought these to go into our little princess's play gym and she loves them. The balls are not flimsy and easy to clean. We saw the same product at [..] for [...] Glad we got from here.	1
Just got this in and it is TOTALLY CHEAP. This is .99 cents store quality with a fancy box.  They're just plastic little balls  :/	-1
We just purchased this product for my 9 y-o's birthday and she is so pleased!  She is very interested in space and asked to transform her room into a "space room" and this was a great find.  All of the planets glow and it looks especially neat in the dark.  She loves going to sleep under her glowing planets and stars.  I think this toy is appropriate for children as young as 2 and as old as a teenager (maybe even higher - heck, I'd love it in my room and I'm almost 40!)  We've also purchased a moon, the Uncle Milton Moon In My Room and a book, 13 Planets: The Latest View of the Solar System (National Geographic Kids)- I also recommend both items in addition to this product.  Educational and fun!	1
My only real gripe about this product is that these balls are inconsistent in quality - some are made of thicker material than others. But that's not really a problem, for me anyway.  These are, whichever way you look at them, thin plastic balls. They will crush, ding, dent or otherwise loose their perfect roundness if you let anything heavier than say, another plastic ball, collide with them. I mean, would you expect an egg to be able to cope with a three year old child jumping on it? No. It's an egg.  However!  If this distresses you greatly, you can resurrect them by warming them very gently with a hairdryer. Or as I did, leave them next to a heating vent.  I placed an order for 1000 of these, they arrived in bags of 100, some rectangular bags, some cylindrical bags. The last 300 arrived loose in two boxes (150 balls a piece). I called the manufacturer and they explained why this may happen... They ship bulk. If a box can be filled with 150 balls, it will cost the same as shipping with a bag of 100 balls and the box 1/3 empty. They use common sense - ship more in a box for the same price and SAVE YOU MONEY.  The bags these things ship in are meant to hold plastic balls. They will not hold up well if you choose to constantly pack and unpack them. They will not hold up well if you use them for anything other than storage. I'm thinking I will not want to repack 1000 balls into 10 bags anyway.	1
I bought this product with very cheap price which is $6.00. Thank you for this lightning special for this special science tool for teaching solar system to my daughter.	1
This is great for learning the planets in our own solar system. And it could very well influence young people who would become our future people going into space travel.	1
We bought this set for our son's birthday because he is in love with everything space related.  I found it easy to put together and we had fun hanging them as a family.  My only wish is that the planets were somehow labeled as to what they are.  I suppose I could have done this before hanging them, but I didn't and now I have no clue which is which.  My son likes to tell me what they are though, so that works for me.	1
The most tedious part of this set, for me, was putting Saturn's ring into place.  Hanging it was not hard.  I used putty that I had bought from the store, I just figured it would work better than the included putty.  I installed this whole thing myself (stay at home mom), with a 1 year old and a 3.5 year old and a huge ladder, everyone in the same room that includes a Thomas the train table to work around, and I was able to get them up in no time.  I used the smoke detector as the "sun" and lined them up from there.  My 3.5 year old knows the name, and color of every planet after 1 hour.  So I would say it is educational.  The kit glows well, really well.  The stars included are what you would expect. They are kind of poor.  I bought a tube of the 3D stars by the same company.  It is a tube of just 30 stars.  I placed putty on them and stuck them to the ceiling.  I just figured the stars should have some dimension like the planets.  1 tube was enough for the whole ceiling.  The room looks great.  I highly recommend the tube of 30 3D stars too!  They are also fantastic!  We have them in both kids rooms.  If you buy them, you will need to use a different brand of putty to hang them to your ceiling.  My husband hung the stars by string in my daughters with the included putty and they all fell.  I stuck them flat with a different putty and they are fine.  I cannot tell you if they glow for an acceptable amount of time b/c I don't use them as a night light.  That seems like an unrealistic expectation of anything glow in the dark.  I use a really dim night light and my children can still see the bright stars over the dim night light.  and I am able to check on them later without walking around in a dark room.  In the day time I wish there was a sun, but at night time I wouldn't want it so it isn't that big of a deal to me that it isn't in the kit.  Still haven't figured out what to do with Pluto though...	1
Love this product, looks great hanging in 10 year olds room! Glows in different colors in the dark! Takes about 30-40 minutes from start to finish to hang this up! Very sturdy once it's up.	1
i bought this for my toddler son's room. He loves the planets! i used them as a mobile over his crib, they are very entertaining. Before i had them hanging, he would roll and chase the glowing planet all around his room before bed. he thought it was the funniest thing ever!	1
I gave this as a gift for a seven year old boy that is interested in astronomy. He absolutely loves it! His mom says the glow in the dark aspect is so cool and pretty that his little sister wants to sleep in his room.	1
I purchased this for my three-year old nephew, and he is learning to identify the planets--with Saturn being his favorite. He enjoys looking at the little plastic worlds--though he thinks Mercury is the Moon! :)  The planet colors are fairly good for such a toy product, and the planets themselves are different sizes. The kit is a nice idea; however, I wish the whole product was a little more durable and easier to display.	1
I bought this for my children's room which has an outer space theme.  The planets are nicely done and look great.  No, they don't glow in the dark all night long... but who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways?!?!  They certainly glow long enough for both of my boys to fall asleep!  We have a round ceiling light which I put triangular "rays" around which is now our SUN.  I'm giving this 4 stars ONLY because I agree about the sticker stars... yeah... they kinda stink.  BUT, the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars are easy to find (I've even seen them in pharmacy's) and inexpensive.  We put up 2 packages of the plastic ones and added the sticker stars from the package.  It gives the effect of stars which are closer and farther away!!	1
The educational value of having the planets hang from our son's room is great.  At 4 years-old, he could name the nine planets thanks in large part to this "toy".  So I give it the highest marks in educational value.  A little tid-bit about each of the planets is provided on a panthlet in this set and I read it to our son as my husband hung the set.  Our son actually memorized much of what I read to him and when the set was new he asked me to reread the panthlet to him several times to fill in the pieces of information that he had forgotten. It's also fun in that our son enjoys showing it to our guests and telling them about the planets.  However, I rate the set as 4 out of 5 stars in the fun category simply because it is more like decoration.  This set hangs from the ceiling, so you never play with it or even touch it once it is hung.  You simply enjoy looking at it and talking about it. The downside of this set is that the stars are really small stickers so you will want to purchase some larger glow-in-the-dark stars.  Also it is a pain to hang this set since you have to tie fishing line to each of the planets and then use tack-like objects to connect them to the ceiling.  But once you have it all set up your child will probably be pleased.	1
My daughter is 10 months old and absolutely adores this toy. She loves books, whether she's looking at the pictures or chewing on them and this toy is great for both. It's very durable. My daughter has banged it and dropped it frequently and it's still going strong. The story is read out as you turn each page and your child is asked to match the block to the animal they're counting on that page. Then the next page switches animals and adds one more. By the end your child has counted up to five with five different animals. You can also play the song on each page which is a Leapfrog version of Old Mac Donald. . It is a cute story that will help your children identify animals and numbers up to 5. When your child is finished palying the block goes in place and the book has a lock tab to keep it in place so it doesn't get lost. There is a handle on top which makes it easy for my daughter to grab and carry around. It's great for at home, but works especially well in the car or over Grandma's house. The colors on my block aren't fading as some of the other reviewers noted, but this seems to be one toy my daughter doesn't chew on. It's educational, durable, and easy to clean. I have a few other Leapfrog toys and they all are wonderful. Another Leapfrog toy that I'm exceptionally happy with.	1
This is good fun for parents and babies alike. As your child turns each sturdy plastic page, the story is read out by a computer voice. Alternatively, the unit can be switched to 'singing' and a song is sung for each page. The pages go from one to five and ask the reader to find Tad's Cow, his pig, and his sheep etc. A cube with pictures will need to be turned by baby to so that the pig is facing the front and the baby will be told if he has found the correct animal. The animals go up from 1 cow to 5 sheep and help baby learn numbers. Educational and enjoyable, and the song (an altered version of Old MacDonald) does not grate as much as some electronic toys.	1
We received 2 tents for Christmas.  This one and another from a different company.  They were similar in size, however the other was $45 vs. this one for $100.  Every aspect of this tent is simply better.  This is still not industrial grade poles or fabric, but it is just so much better than the other companies that make kids tents.  The tents themselves are roomy and taller than most indoor kids-dome tents, can easily get 2 big kids (8 year olds) or 4 small kids (3 year olds) in these tents and have room to play a game or do a puzzle.  The tubes are self expandable and seem very high quality and pretty kid tough.  It is true, they do not "attach" via velcro or tie on to the tents or the middle compartment, but my kids have not had difficulties with that yet.  You simply slide one "ring" of the tube's inner metal spring into the tent hole and it fits - yes a 7 year old flying through there may dislodge it - but it hasn't been a problem for us yet.  The poles for the tents are the big improvement over other brands, they are designed to "bend" and then "straighten" back out where as the other brands i've seen bend, and stay bent.  I see some room for improvement and it's not a great buy for $100, but is a very good buy.  Whereas the other brands i've seen on amazon or tested out myself are really poor buys.	1
We bought this for my 18mth old son.  The kids love it!  Even my 9, 8, 6 and 2 year olds love it too.  We have it set up in our basement and they play hide and seek in it.  It does disconnect at the seams because there are no ties or velcros to hold it together.  For the most part, it was worth the money.	1
My daughter loves books!  And this one is no exception.  She can open this book herself and "read" it while playing with the block.  At 18 months, she still doesn't get the idea of putting the block into the book for the correct animals, but I'm sure that will come with time.  This has been a favorite since we got it almost a year ago!	1
Learn to count to 5 for babies.  Great for fine motor skills for little ones.  They need to match the picture on the block with the correct picture on the page, and then place the block in the hole.  The block is a perfect size for little hands.  Tad's voice is very soothing to hear, too.  Nice book overall, but I know I didn't pay $24.99.  It was less than $20.00.	1
kids love it	1
HOURS of fun for my babies (14 months and 30 months)!	1
Our 15-month-old daughter loves this toy.  Right now she is getting the hang of putting the block in its proper slot, and she enjoys listening to the frog singing about his farm.  Turning the pages without the risk of ripping something also appeals to her a great deal.  The time will come when she will work on her numbers, and also on telling the difference between the animals.  This is not a toy that will be hopelessly obsolete for us in the next three months, which is something I very much appreciate.	1
I decided to take advantage of the leap frog buy 2 get 1 free sale and am I glad I did. I received 3 of these books for the price of 2. They are so cute. It sings or talks in a very clear voice. The premise is counting 1 to 5. Each page has a different animal on it and theres 1 less animal than the # called for. Theres a block that the child turns to the picture of the animal and puts in the book and then the book sings a song about the animal and #. A wonderful teaching tool for very small children. I purchased these for 3 grandchildren between the ages of 6 months and 15 months and I know they'll love them. Leap Frog makes the best toys and they're very high quality--this is a must have toy for young children.	1
This makes an excellent toy for traveling to the doctor, or waiting in an office.  Animal identification and vocal sounds are part of the "curricula" for early childhood development, and this toy is a great tool. Toddlers will need some assistance, however, in turning the cube in the appropriate pages.	1
I purchased this for a one year old's first birthday and now it's a year later.  I generally have kids ages 1-6 at my house.  The kids love when I bring it out.  It takes up most of the living room & it's an easy to assemble fort.  It's not super high quality, but you are getting two tents, four tunnels, and that center thing for the price.  In the end it really exceeded my expectations & I am sure when the kids are older they will not have forgotten this particular toy like 95% of the others.	1
Great detail	1
So in love! I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas to go with her doll house. The doll house is built big enough to pair with Barbies so I wanted a stable to fit her Barbie horses as well and this is perfect! The craftsmanship is superb. Well worth the $60 I paid for the stable. We've had it for a few months now with no issues. I had originally wanted to paint it but I've actually grown to like the unfinished look. Be aware that this is no small stable! It folds up very nicely but does take up a lot of room.	1
My 4 year old granddaughter LOVES this.  I painted the roof a nice barn red, the bars in the windows black and glued miniature wooden horseshoes on it in several places.  Then I bought a classic sized horse with removable saddle and bridle to put inside it, which included several grooming tools, feed bucket and trophy.  Made a great gift.	1
This was the perfect gift for my horse loving daughter. Beautiful! Well made, and amazing price. My dad thought we paid over $100 for it. Great size for barbie size horses.	1
Nice quality barn.	1
A huge hit w/ my daughter for her Breyer Traditional horses.	1
Purchased for Granddaughter for  Christmas, she loved loved loved it, I was really impressed how quality made it was. all the doors open without hanging up or catching. the corral fence is a large size. Made for medium size horses. Highly suggest buying.	1
It's a Christmas gift so my daughter has not played with it yet however much bigger then I expected I think that she will love it	1
finally arrived, and it is awesome. I paid for shipping and it took too long. but if your kids love horses, this is the best. She is going to love this birthday gift from her Grammy and papa, the price is amazing for this.	1
Thanks	1
Melissa and Doug has not disappointed yet. This stable reminds me of "old School". We got it for our 2 y/o daughter and she plays the heck out of it. She has had it for 4 months and has not broken. Would not hesitate to tell others about it.	1
Fun solid wood stable. Feels well built all around. I ended up painting mine but the wood like is fine too.	1
Amazing barn for the price!  Wonderful quality!  Bought this for my daughter to keep her toy horses.  Regarding size, my daughter has Barbie horses and 10-inch Paradise horses.  The Barbie horses just fit; the Paradise horses fit, too, but just barely -- their ears scrape the ceiling.  But they do fit, and my daughter loves all the doors that open -- wonderful detail.	1
The all wood stable has many easily moving parts and is nicely constructed.  It has rough edges in places, but nothing some light sanding will not fix.  I'd do this before giving it to a child or there will be splinters (got one picking it up for the first time).  Go easy on removing the cardboard from the wood, the sticky tape comes off without leaving residue, but it peels slowly.  I'd add a few simple latches so all the doors would not open while carrying, and also a sturdier latch for closing the entire unit.  But even without the latches, it is a great accessory for toy horses.	1
This is one of the best toys we own. As a parent, I appreciate the fact that a lot of thought clearly went into the design and manufacturing of this 100% wooden stable. The foldable fence stands up easily and can be stored above the stalls, all of the doors slide or open/close as they should, and it's light enough for my 5-year-old and 7-year-old to pick up and carry even though it's very sturdy. My kids use it with the set of three Melissa and Doug horses, and also with a variety of other horses and action figures. They play with it for hours! In my opinion, this is a rare find and is a toy our family will use and treasure for many, many years.	1
I bought this for my 6 and 3 year old girls.  They absolutely love it!  Personally I love the quality....well worth the money spent.	1
My Grandson Loves it! Also bought the large castle. He loves cars, trucks, trains but is also intrigued with architecture. Perfect for boys, only problem was the furniture available was only sold in pink. I bought it & had a very fun paint day.	1
grand son enjoyed it greatly	1
Oh how I LOVE M&D toys! well made through and through! you will never get junk when you buy this brand. I am also thrilled to have saved $$$ over the actual breyer barns. They were double the price! I remember growing up having a barn similar to this and it was so fun and made playing with my breyer that much better! Shipping was FAST packaging gets 5 stars too. and I LOVE that the box had NO PHOTO of the barn on it . It is a surprise for Christmas and I didn't want it ruined due to a picture! Quality long lasting toys are hard to find but I would say this is one we can pass down if cared for properly!	1
This barn is fantastic!  So well made!  This seller shipped it very fast too. I can't wait for my daughter to open this on Christmas	1
Awesome quality! Much bigger and nicer than I expected. Folds up easily. My 6 and 4 year old daughters love this	1
Sturdy and heavy. Fits traditional size Breyers well.	1
Bought this for 3 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She was SUPER excited! The barn will accommodate 3 Barbie-sized horses, or the entire dozen of the Pasture Pals. Would recommend getting an extra set of fencing for more versatile play.	1
Well I really like Melissa and Doug and that's why I bought this stable for my daughter for Christmas. It is big and wonderful for playing with horses or ponies. She has had it for only a month and a half though and the wood has split on two of the stable doors already. They weren't broken when I recieved it and my daughter does not play rough with it at all. The wood literally split vertically on the bottom of one door and then on a hinge on the other door. I thought this stable would have lasted forever but unfortunately I was wrong and have emailed Melissa and Doug about it hoping to get it resolved.	-1
This was definitely the favorite gift this year.  It is really cool with doors that slide and others that are hinged.  It feels sturdy and my granddaughter now has a home for her beloved horses.	1
This is a nice stable and a good size, however, one door did break off already and one of the roofing pieces started splitting/fraying....  We were able to fix both though...	1
My grandson loves this. Quality is awesome and it is very big! Great product and should last for years	1
Very well made. And quite large. My girls really enjoy this.	1
This is one well made horse stable but with Melissa and Doug who would expect anything less.  The stable is well worth the money.  My granddaughter plays with it all the time.	1
Adorable stable perfect for 1/16 Bruder style horses. Can't wait for her to open it at Christmas.	1
Looks great. Hope it is easy to store. My 3 year old granddaughter loves horses and will be so surprised when she finds it under her Christmas tree. Wish that it was painted in more vibrant colors.	1
We got this for my dauther when she was 10. She is now 12 and it's still in great shape. She loves it. The only part we had to wood glue was the shingle and that was recently. She uses it with her traditional size Breyer Horses.	1
its ok	1
This is a great quality stable and fits most bigger brands of horses.  I would caution that the doors are very fragile and can easily break.	1
My granddaughter loves it and months later is still having fun with this well made toy!	1
good size..easy assembly	1
Great item well worth the money	1
This barn is fantastic! My mom bought for me (I'm 11), but it took forever to get here. Got lost in the mail, not Amazons fault I guess. Took 2 months to get here, but it was worth the wait! You should totally get this!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
I wish i could give this more stars. This is an amazing toy that can be passed Down from your children to your grandchildren. It is sturdy and drear quality. Plus a bonus for me is you can personalize it by painting it. However I left ours alone. I love the wood look.	1
I purchased this for my 7 year old daughter and she just flipped when she got it.  I like it because it looks real and is made very well.  I would highly recommend purchasing it.	1
this is the most amazing stable and a majority of the horses fit. it looks and works like a real stable and is durable. my daughter plays with it everyday. we are planing to buy her 2 more to complete her stable set up the price is worth it	1
I talked my daughter out of buying the larger Breyer stable in favor of this much cheaper one. I told her we could paint it if she ally wanted. When it arrived I could not believe how big it was. I never even looked at the measurements to be honest but even so it is very large. One of the doors did fall off fairly easily when I hit it accidentally with my leg but it was glued back on without issue. I do wish it had a lock to keep it closed when moving it but that is neither here nor there. The stables are large enough to hold a couple of horses each. She was absolutely elated when it arrived. It also came with a large, beautiful wooden fence. If you have a 6/7 year old child that loves Breyer horses this is THE accessory to get.	1
Really nice, well-made barn.  It works great for my daughter's Breyer traditional horses.  It is compact.  It has nice details.	1
My son has had this barn for a couple years and I just bought one for my daughter because they are constantly fighting over it.  It is the most sturdy barn we've had yet and we have lots of them.	1
Very nice item. The quality is great really sturdy and it is a good size. My girls 6 and 8 got it for christmas and both love playing with it	1
I was very pleased that this came fully assembled. My 4 year old daughter was very happy to receive this. It is well built and a nice size for toy horses, plenty of room for play without taking up an enormous amount of floor space.	1
We bought this barn for our four year old daughter.  She is obsessed with anything and everything that has to do with horses.  It was the perfect gift for her! The barn is sturdy. It fits her wide variety of horses that range from My Little Ponies to big Barbie horses. The wooden fence that comes with the barn is great, but we are thankful we bought the Breyer Wood Corral, because the original fencing would only hold a few of her horses. When she uses both fences together, it creates a large corral for all of her horses. We highly recommend the Melissa & Doug Folding Horse Stable for your little horse lover!	1
Hi quality as is all of Melissa and Doug items.  Love it.  Great for smaller horses, not the tall/big ones.  Purchase the extra corral and it's a great set!	1
Melissa & Doug Folding Horse Stable  The base of this large all wood stable is roughly 13"x18 folded and 13"x26" when opened.  From base to the peak of the roof measures about 14.5".  Yes, this is a big toy.  Item descriptions I have seen say this is scaled for the "Classic" Breyer horses.  That doesn't work out quite right.  The Breyer Classic horses are scaled at 1:12.  They can't stand at the Dutch doors and stick their heads out without being propped up with their front feet suspended up off the floor .  THIS STABLE IS MORE CLOSELY SCALED TO THE 1:9 TRADITIONAL BREYER HORSES.  At this scale, the Dutch doors are the correct height for a 1:9 scale horse with strait forelegs to stand comfortably at the door and stick his head out the opening.  But even a horse of this scale can be a snug fit.  It needs to have its tail hanging down for the smaller stall.  It looks like the stable was built with an eye to a 1:10 scale.  Unfortunately, the 3 ft. corral fence supplied seems way too short.  When you round that out, it would make an enclosure just 9 inches square.  A better length would have been 6 ft.  That would make an enclosure that is 1.5 ft. square.  The stable comes unfinished.  A clear coat will bring out the warmth of the wood and protect it from juice box spill stains.  A light grey stain would give a a nice, natural weathered look.  The 16 lb. stable does not lend itself to be being frequently relocated.  But, if the stable is to be moved around a lot, a latch should be added to keep it folded and any loose contents safely inside.  The Dutch doors can be held shut with thin magnetized rubber strips.  You may already have some of this material in the form of business cards stuck on your refrigerator. The longer the strips, the better they will hold.  This is a well-built toy that should last for a long time.	1
My daughter said this was her favorite present from Christmas, she screamed when opening it, " IT'S A BARN" well worth the money, quality is great. We will be staining it for her & putting name plates on the stall doors. This barn is good for Traditional size Breyer horses	1
This has exceeded our expectations as it is quite large and sturdy with moving parts that keep my 3YO's interest.  My only complaint is trying to match animals sizes to the size of this stable.  It would have been nice to have had some tips or a product recommendation on what size horses to purchase as the Schleich ones are really too small.	1
I looked around everywhere for a stable for my granddaughter's horses!  I got her Horses for xmas now she needed a stable!  This is the best on, by far!  It is made so well, all wooden doors slide, doors open with ease, windows are easy to access!  It is just great and easy to play with and store all your horses inside! My granddaughter just loved this and so did everyone else!	1
I remember having a wood stable and corral for my Breyer horses when I was a little girl.  It was one of my favorite Christmas gifts.  Now I have a 7 year old daughter who plays with my horses and needed a nice stable for them.  I can't wait for her to open this on Christmas morning!  It's beautifully made and is the perfect size for Breyer Classics horses.  A few other reviewers have said they seem a little small for the stable, but I think they are a perfect fit.  The corral fencing that comes with the stable is well-made and unfolds easily - I ordered an extra set as well so my daughter can make a large corral for all her horses.  If you are looking for a nice quality stable for your child, look no further.  This is it!  The plastic stables I saw in stores and online don't even compare to this.  If my daughter doesn't play with this (which is doubtful!), then I will.  I plan on keeping this for future grandkids, as well.	1
My daughter got this kitchen for christmas, at 2 years old.  She LOVES it.  All the noises are fun (but sometimes the faucet sound goes on forever) and there is so much storage space.  She pretends to rinse dishes and then puts them in the dishwasher.  She pretends to bake cookies in the oven.  And she even pretends to give her stuffed cat toy baths in the sink.  The microwave is her favorite though.  It makes three different sounds, and we are always finding other toys hidden in there.  And the shutters are fun.  You don't get a whole lot of food and/or cookware accessories.  But the ones you do get are very good quality.  And they are foods she loves (esp. mac n cheese and spaghetti).  I bought a couple additional sets from the Small World brand, and they are just the right size for this kitchen.	1
I found the connecting wire between the tap and the stove a struggle because the instructions sequence your actions so that the tap is screwed down first.  However, the connection from tap to stove cannot be secured unless the tap is fixed into position after the stove.  Even then, I had to use decorator's tape to hold the connector into the stove.  A power tool is really needed to complete this job effortlessly. With it the assembly should be quick if the connection discussed above was a simple matter.  Finally some of the stickers are not easily attached.  Now it is assembled, I hope it stays together!!	-1
Luckilly I ordered this last week when amazon was selling them w/FREE super saver shipping (great deal!!)  The shipping company even called and arranged a time when they could deliver it to my house so someone would be here.  The kitchen comes in one piece, except you have to screw on the doors to the cupboards, etc.  I checked to make sure all pieces were intact, since we will not be setting this up until Christmas Eve.  The only thing was the stickers were a little crumpled from being crammed in the box, but Little Tikes has wonderful customer service and they are sending me more for free in the next couple days.  I am very pleased with how sturdy everything feels, and the accessories are the perfect size.  I know this will be a huge hit with my daughter on Christmas morning (and I can't wait to play with it, too!!!). Thanks Amazon!!	1
Purchased this kitchen from Toysrus.com and just received it a few days ago. It took my husband *maybe* 10 minutes max to put together. The directions are fairly useless as all they show are pictures and aren't *that* clear BUT it could not be more simple to put together. Not too many screws and some snap in pieces. The stickers came all crumbled but I was able to salvage them somewhat but will contact little tikes for a replacement set (due to a poor packaging job on their part, I've had stickers from almost all of their products arrive in that condition).  OK, on to the features, pro's & con's.... The kitchen in my opinion is the perfect size, not too little not too overwhelming. It fit perfectly in my kitchen (which is not large at all) and my son loves cooking right next to me. He LOVES the microwave but he's still a little short for it (he's 21 months) but stands on his tippy toes and that's fine (he will have lots of time to really grow with this kitchen in a variety of ways). The microwave is fabulous and I took the tip of another reviewer to not put the popcorn sticker on it which was an excellent tip, otherwise you can't see what's inside and my son loves to check out what's "cooking" in there. Also, as another reviewer said the microwave door doesn't completely close but it's close enough and I think the only people that actually care about these little nuances are us parents:)  Same thing with the oven door, that doesn't completely close either (it's a little ill-fitting) but completely unimportant. My son LOVES LOVES LOVES when it's says "what would you like to cook"? ..."A hot dog", "eggs and bacon" etc. He gets so excited from the sizzling sounds and that it "speaks to him", he also loves the sound of the running water and pushing the puttons on the microwave. I also must say Little Tikes did a FANTASTIC job with the voice work on this kitchen. The voices are all little kids and they are SOOOOO cute, and speak very very clearly which I love. Yes, it is a little loud but a very easy fix is a piece of clear packing tape over the voice box which can easily be accessed under the black "grill", it made a huge difference, now it's just right. The only real con I can say about this kitchen is, it would have been nice if the dishwasher and the oven opened just like a regular one not side to side but I do understand why they made it this way. I think they incorporated just the right about of sounds into this kitchen as well, enough to be engaging and not too much to take away from using their imagination. The colors are awesome, nice and clean and modern looking and the best part GENDER NEUTRAL! I know some people love the look of the step2 kitchen but I personally think it's old fashioned looking, dark and dreary and an eye sore -- this is fun and fresh! I know they don't sell additional food for this kitchen but really don't think you need any more sizzling and cooking food that's interactive. I will buy additional play food but what they provided that works on the stove (eggs and bacon, hot dog on a bun, mac and cheese, spaghetti & meatballs & chicken) is truly sufficient. My only concern as others have stated is losing these pieces because they don't sell replacements...yet. But, I decided to make it into a learning game with my son and teach him that food and cooking utensils do not leave the kitchen i.e. so we don't lose the pieces (so far so good;)  I HIGHLY recommend this kitchen and feel that it's a wonderful toy for a toddler on up that will help foster their imagination and bring many years of smiles and laughter. It's very well made as are all little tikes products are and I love how easy it is to clean. All drumsticks up on this one!	1
I bought this for my eight year old daughter, and she seems to love it!  The detail and craftmanship is great, and I love that all the doors work smoothly!  It is made pretty sturdy, but a playmate has broken the wooden hinge on one of the lower doors, and there's no way for me to fix it so that it will also function.  I would also warn that if you are thinking of buying it to paint, there is a coating over the wood that does not take paint too readily! She has fun and it fits her Breyer horses well.	1
Looked all over for a worthy enough stable for my daughters Breyer horse collection she plays with.  The quality of this wooden stable is outstanding and I highly recommend.  It's very large so it works with many different play horses.  Worth every penny I paid.	1
i bought this stable for my 2 1/2 year old niece.  she loves horses but had no stable to put them in.  once she opened it, she had a hard time letting go.  my brother told me that she wanted to sleep with it that night and stay up late to play with it.  i was so happy that i listened to the reviews on this item and bought this one not the "other popular brand" that horse lovers like. this stable is paint free and so beautiful.	1
It's a nice toy.  Even though it is not purple, pink or sparkly, my daughter really likes it.  I like the simplistic look and it's durability.	1
I was surprised at how big this stable is.  It's nice wood and great quality.  Much better price for the product than some of the other brands.  My daughter will love this for Christmas.	1
We had a hand-me down kitchen since my first b/g twins were 18 months, they are now 3 and have 8 month old twin brothers. We decided that a pink kitchen wasn't fit for our family, so we went in search of a new one. It was between this one and the dream kitchen. They were both, non gender specific, and both interactive. We liked this one better because the colors are more appealing to kids (atleast it was to our 3 year olds in toys r us) and that it is a little more interactive. Of course this kitchen should be for pretend, but its nice that you can put eggs on the stove and it will tell you what it is, you can also buy additional interactive foods from toysrus and from amazon. It is very durable and has held up to much abuse. My 3 year olds love to cook when mommy does (ours is in the kitchen and the old one is in the playroom). We have a lot of dishes and food, and for the ones that don't fit in the kitchen, we put in a small basket next to it. ITs big enough for about 3-4 toddlers to play with at a time. It encourages sharing and cooaperation. My kids have alot of fun with it and they espcially like the oven, who knows why! I think this kitchen is great, cute friendly and a little more interactive than the lifestyles!	1
Purchased the M&D folding horse stable for my four year old grandson.  He had received a number of Bruder horses for Christmas.  He seemed to enjoy it although not as much as I had imagined.  The fence seemed to entertain him as much as the barn, but, my older grandson accidentally backed into it and it broke apart immediately.  As cute as it was, the fence design was not very durable.  However, the stable seems sturdy and should last a very long time.  Just wish it was painted rather than plain.	1
My daughter got this from Santa and both of our children love toplay with it! Another great buy from Little Tikes.  We looked around at all of the kitchen sets from all in 1 unit like this one to the separate pieces oven/fridge/etc. (these would have taken up more room).  My daughter was only 1 at the time and we opted to not purchase the infant/toddler one because she would get more long term use out of this kind. We ended up going with this particular one because it isn't obnoxiously colored like alot of the hard plastic toys- it actually appears as a "real" kitchen would and it didn't cost a fortune.  This kitchen comes with all the modern conveniences you would have in your own kitchen -  off white with accents - the flower pot sticker, food in the cupboards, dishwasher under counter, coffee pot, phone etc.  Not too long to assemble nor difficult but electric screwdriver easiest/quickest way to go.  If you have access to a SUV/truck/minivan of some sort that is the best way to transport as it does come in a LARGE box (we have a corolla and it probably would not have fit into it)  The sayings are cute and now my son repeats alot of them - "be careful it's hot" and yes they can get annoying but how many young childrens toys that make noise aren't.  I feel that this feature gets the kids to interact with it even more - what is it going to say next/do next - also a plus if you only have one child - promotes self playing to give you a moments piece.  Downfalls to this kitchen is phone not interactive -something with buttons would be better and there is not alot of "counter space"  I purchased a separate bin organizer for my children to store their food and dishes in and they have a table that they use for making things at as this kitchen does not have a ton of storage or a lot of work room.  It is wide enough for 2-3 kids to play at at one time - one at microwave/kitchen sink/stove.  Comes with several accessories - pots/food so that they can play with immediately but would recommend picking up a dish set and additional play food to avoid arguements over the few pieces it comes with.  Overall another excellent toy by Little Tikes!	1
My sister n law bought this kitchen for her daughter last year for Christmas who was just about to turn two years of age..I have a one and a half year old daughter and a three and a half year old daughter who go over there all the time..This kitchen is very durable, realistic with its sounds and appearance as well too. One of the best features about this toy is that 3 children can play comfortably with the toy without too many arguments...It does come with some food and pots and pans and utensils...I am debating on whether or not to buy this toy as it appears larger in size or the Lifestyles kitchen as I would like for both of my children to be able to play with it ( without the youngest one having to grow taller to be able to do so )...This toy overall though is an excellent purchase..I do know that my sister n law had to fix the microwave as it was not working when they had first purchased it. Other than that though the toy is great and affordable and very nice in size compared to alot of the other smaller kitchens which in areas causes alot of arguing and pushing and shoving to be able to play...I do recommend this kitchen as I have seen it plenty of times and my children have played with this toy as well too..The sink is also a very cute feature with its sounds that it makes and realistic in appearance..This toy should last for years...It is very durable..	1
Good overall pretend play item. For the price, they could do a little more sanding of some of the wood surfaces. My daughter loves it and plays with all kinds of her toys in the stable not just horses.	1
I bought this for my daughter who is horse crazy! It was the best gift ever, she thinks! Wonderfully made, great size... love all the working doors and fence! A++	1
Bought this for Christmas for my pre-teen, horse-crazed daughter.  It's generously sized and when unfolded, creates enough room for both my girls (the other is 5) to play comfortably together.  Well-made of solid wood. All the operational doors and hole from the loft make this versatile and fun.  It's endured frequent play, being sat upon, sisterly squabbles and even our toddler's less-than-gentle investigations.  Folded up, it holds A LOT, nice and neat.  We have several Breyer Classic-sized horses in it, a couple dolls, all their accessories, the fence, and stable-cleaning tools, with plenty of room to spare.  Breyer Traditional horses are probably more to scale, given window height, but it'll hold fewer of those than we can fit of the Classics.  The price is half that of comparable models - and those models don't have the fold-up storage option, which I LOVE.  This is one toy that will be saved for grandkids someday.	1
My two-year-old daughter received this for her birthday and she immediately took to it... We could not drag her away to play party games with the other kids! Big pluses for parents: It's durable and sturdy, no worries about kids hurting themselves.  Also, it's easy to put together.  Took me about twenty minutes. My only concern, as with any children's toy, is that there are loose parts that might get lost... These are food items, which could be easily replaced by generic kitchen-type toys.  The only parts you would not want your kids to misplace are the foods (eggs/bacon, spaghetti, mac & cheese) which trigger the cooking sounds. But I'm not sure I have to worry about those loose parts.  My daughter made sure all of the foods, dishes, and pans were put away in the various storage areas of the kitchen.  She was very particular about this. All in all, a great play item for the kids.  They can put their imagination to full use on this toy!	1
My daughter received this kitchen when she was 1 1/2 years old, and she loved it! (And stills does!). She loves pushing the microwave buttons while she has play food inside, the microwave makes great sounds (popcorn popping, hamburger sizzling, and water boiling). She pretends to wash her hands under the sink while the sink makes a water noise (like when you turn on the faucet in a real kitchen). The kitchen also says lots of things, like "what do you want to cook?" or "let's make a hot dog" or "be careful, the mac n' cheese isn't done cooking."  This was a great purchase and I think it was worth the price to see my daughter have so much fun with it.	1
We had the Cookin Sounds Kitchen by Little Tikes and were VERY disappointed. First of all, the top constantly came off. Second of all, the phone holder would never stay on, therefore making it useless. It did not have that many features either. It did not even have a fridge, like this one does. I got so frustrated by the thing that I took it back and got this one. I am so happy with this kitchen. Everything about it is great from the talking burners to the window that opens and shuts. My daughter, age 2 1/2 years old, loves to listen to her food cook. She LOVES to have her brother open the window and say "Mam, I would like some eggs and bacon". It also has a lot of storage. She can keep all of her pretend food and pots and pans in the kitchen itself. It has been used almost daily. It is just so much fun. I got mine on sale at Toys R Us, so I think this price is a little much, but it still is fair considering all of the options this kitchen comes with. I think it is definately worth the extra money. I really researched kitchens when I took the Cookin Sounds Kitchen back, so that I did not make the same mistake again. I think this is the very best option out there. You won't be sorry!	1
perfect...  exactly what we were looking for !!! Great quality, looks great.. woking door and garage door.  both my twins love it	1
My son is 11 but loves this house for his lego minifigures. He can play a long time with this house. The dolls that came with it are creepy and he wanted nothing to do with them. But the house is fun.	1
I needed a new doll house for my office at work. Was trying to find one that was gender neutral as most children enjoy playing. I originally had the pink Melissa and Doug portable home and was quite happy with it. This was just a few dollars more, larger, not pink, and included a garage & stairs. It comes with furniture and 2 dolls. I would recommend buying additional dolls for it and perhaps a car.  It was a no brainer. The kids love it. Can paint later if I want...	1
grandson loves it ...durable and great for imagination	1
VERY nice, solid and well made small dollhouse.  It is small, and normal Melissa and Doug furnishings will not fit it.  It's almost a 1:24 scale.  The exterior is lovely and can be painted or have shingles or brick/stone face added but looks nice as it is.  Would make a nice tabletop display and could look very good as part of a Christmas display.	1
Perfect gift.  Well made.	1
I'll start by saying that I am a HUGE Melissa and Doug fan! I ordered this with high expectations and within a few weeks of moderate/low usage, my 21 month old daughter took the door off. Upon closer observation, it appears as though the cause was a split in the wood (as pictured.) I am thankful that I was nearby and saw that it had broken and that she didn't have a chance to put any jagged or small pieces in her mouth. I loved that this toy was foldable and able to be carried around by handles and am sad that it has been deemed unsafe for my kids and our small in home daycare.	-1
Angel tree gift, very well made sure young lady love it.	1
Doesn't take up too much room and can be easily moved around the room.  Not as fun as a regular doll house, but fits our needs.	1
Bought as a gift for our niece - super high quality level (as with most M&D products) and super cute - love that it's portable with it's little handle.  Bought additional furniture for it and hoping our niece gets plenty of play out of it.	1
Great little doll house! We purchased this for our 2 year old son. I'm thrilled that it is gender neutral and has everything that a large doll house has. Great quality and product seems much better made than the huge Kidkraft doll house my daughter had.	1
Purchased for my niece.  Wonderfully built. Great product!	1
Perfect	1
Bought it to use in play therapy	1
Excellent quality and years of play value.	1
Our two year old cannot get enough of this set. It's easy to set up, a breeze to clean up, and a piece of cake to transport around since it's a self containing unit. Melissa & Doug strikes gold yet again!	1
My 2 year old grandson loves this house particularly the garage that has a door that goes up and down. He parks his cars everywhere in the house.  Very well constructed, durable and portable.  Takes little space.	1
Perfect size!  Amazing little wooden pieces!  We LOVE it, Momma included!	1
I'm so very happy with this doll house..amazingly solid and just beautiful. I plan to buy another one soon.	1
Love it! Perfect and simple is the best!	1
Great playhouse I will put a magnet closure on it as sugested .update to this review just to let you all know there are no replacement dolls for this doll house, my dog ate one and I contacted malissa and doug no re placement dolls or additional pices for his dold house .I did sugest  hey migt want to add some becauce his is a perfctsize doll house for all of us grandparents with limited space to store large ply toys for you grand kids. Because of the size of the rooms you will have to get creative when you want to add to it. I purchased the dog,cat and rabbit  from another maker and it stores well in the garage. I also purchased a crib with baby,changing table,stroller set again from another maker it is a little larger for the playhouse but  it stores well inside and my grand daughters  love it  hope this helps you with your purchase choice.	1
We have loved this dollhouse so far. As you can tell from the photos we are in the process of painting and decorating, but it's slow going because our two year old daughter just wants to play! We bought it after we saw reviews and saw how a woman had decorated two of them for her grandchildren.  We stole one of her paint schemes bc it was so cute. Thanks! The quality is incredible. It is a small house (smaller than I imagined) but I love this because my daughter can tote it around. When she is older we have a large Victorian dollhouse that was mine which she will get but I felt she was too young and this is much more age appropriate for now. We use playmobile people in this house, and the Scooby Doo mini figure sets sold at Toys R Us. They fit perfect and the little Jeep set that includes Shaggy was a perfect fit for the garage - I know some people wonder about a car to fit in the garage. Plus her playmobile figures can drive the Jeep as well. All of this to say, if you are looking for a durable wooden dollhouse for a young child, this is for you!	1
I like this dollhouse very much.  The one I received is in perfect condition; no cracks, no splinters.  The door and garage door open and close without any problem.  I like the simplicity of the furniture.  All eleven pieces are smooth to the touch and are fun to hold and examine.  The pair of dolls have a simple charming appeal to me.  I don't plan to paint this dollhouse because I like how the red accents of the furniture and the colors of the dolls' clothing stand out from the natural wooden house.  Can I recommend this toy?  Definitely.  UPDATED 4/26/2016:  I thank Pat who posted an answer to a question on this product page about what toy car will fit in the garage of this dollhouse.  I use the Caillou Pull-Back Vehicle (blue) with this dollhouse.  The car is just the right size to fit inside the garage.  It even comes with the cute little Caillou figurine.  Currently the car is only available in blue, but maybe Amazon will have the red one available for purchase.  See photos I've submitted.	1
If i could i would rate the house itself with 10 stars! It is PERFECT, flawless and simple, and great quality. It holds my 3 year olds attention great, and yet doesnt take up a ton of space. My ONLY issue with the house is that its almost impossible to find a ride in car to fit in the garage, and the people sets you buy from melissa and doug don't fit in the house. Not to mention i have yet to find extra furniture for the house. Melissa and doug PLEASE sell some more accessories to fit in the house! If you did that i would change my review to 5 stars without hesitation.	1
I expected the lower price to reflect the size, not the quality. The house arrived broken; one piece of furniture was broken and another had paint damage. One of the larger wood pieces has an obvious crack in it.	-1
Grandkids love this dollhouse. Bought two already one for my house one for my granddaughters house. The boys love playing with it too	1
My son wanted a dollhouse, but, and I quote "I don't want a stupid girly pink one."  He wanted one for his guys to sleep at night and to park his car in the garage.  I love that this dollhouse is completely neutral.  You could paint it any color if you so desire.  But we're leaving it plain wood, that's how my little guy likes it.  I do like that isn't targeted to a specific gender.  It's not blue or pink, so any child can play with it.  It leaves a lot for the imagination to inspire, and that's what a good toy is all about.	1
Nice product poorly packaged	1
We bought this little playhouse and added a playmobil mommy and kids (5 ) with toys and a construction guy as the dad ( my husband is in construction as well). My 3 yo daughter received it as a Christmas gift and she  just can't get enough.  I painted this little house and it looks great.	1
Great product!	1
Sturdy. Painting possibilities are limitless. Lots of furniture to make it fun	1
my daughter loves this house. i got it for her 3rd birthday present.	1
I love this gender-neutral set. I put the TV piece away so that the rest of the set is baby-friendly. I'd still watch the baby around it, though. The toddlers love to act out real-life and the babies love to put the different pieces in each room.	1
I was considering purchasing a plan toys dollhouse for my son to play with and I'm so glad I found this one instead. Its sturdy and comes with lots of pieces to play with. My son loves setting up the two little dolls and their accessories. The only negative to this toy is the garage doesn't open and close smoothly. My son loves to park a car in the garage so we notice this more as he needs assistance opening and closing it to get the car out.	1
Did not disapoint. My granddaughter loves it!	1
I got this for my granddaughter. My daughter did an amazing job painting it and adding floors for her daughter. It is easily portable and a huge hit with my granddaughter	1
Fun toy, my son loves playing with the garage door for looooong periods. Cars in and cars out. A bit pricey though.	1
I got this one because it allowed me to pick the colors - I hate the pink and purple most dollhouses are...ours was sprayed gold!  And my girl loves it...best Christmas purchase ever!	1
This is my 3-year old daughter's first dollhouse, and she absolutely loves it!  It's a nice size - small enough that she really can close it up and carry it from room to room, but large enough to really be able to play in.  I also like that it's just natural wood, no paint.  Eventually, I plan to let my daughter personalize it with some paint.  Very cute, love it!	1
Starter doll house for my 20 mth old. Good deal for wooden dollhouse with furniture and 2 people. She hasn't shown a great deal of interest in it yet so it's in the closet and I will reintroduce it in a few months. The dollhouse would look nice painted	1
This was purchased as a gift from Santa for a toddler boy. It is hard to find a gender neutral dollhouse, but this one fits the bill. Attached garage is a distinguishing feature that is really enjoyed by the recipient. The included dolls are kind of lame, but we use playmobil figures with it, which are the perfect size.	1
This is a great dollhouse. We try to keep our livingroom somewhat clean and this is something that can be on display without adding clutter (unlike some of the plastic ones which might look a bit cheesy on display in an adult room). I was so impressed that the garage door opens and so does the front door. It looks like a real little house all folded up, unlike some dollhouses that are just a bi-section of a house. Very well built and the natural wood makes it a unisex toy. Boys like dolls too! It comes with 11 pieces of furniture and 2 dolls, one of each gender. The furniture is not very fine or realistic but it's sturdy and fits well in the house. There is even a little staircase in there! I got this for my 2 year old girl for her birthday and I think I will paint and design the inside of it before giving it to her, just cause I have some fun ideas for it (shutters, rugs, etc). It still looks nice just left alone though. The only thing I would change, as some others have said, is that it doesn't clamp shut so you might want to add a little button & elastic closure or else help your child transport it if you don't want all the furniture to spill out when you move it. Small price to pay for such a great toy.	1
This was the first dollhouse we got for our girls.  I mostly bought it because of the Melissa and Doug brand name and because it was all wooden and not too big.  We live in a very small house, so there just isn't room for a huge dollhouse - or even one much bigger than this one.  I have to say that I was a bit disappointed in it, though, when we got it home, for many of the reasons that others have already mentioned. 1)  I didn't like the dolls.  They weren't very posable or, well, cool looking.  2)  The furniture seemed to be limited to what came with the house.  And 3) it was all pretty plain.  I didn't know was to do about the first two issues, but I decided to paint the house to spruce it up a bit.  That made a big difference!  I've uploaded a customer image of our painted house, if you want to see it.  I only painted the outside.  One of these days, I'll get around to painting the inside too - maybe some wallpaper?  Carpeting? :)  A while went by, and we bought some PlayMobil sets - not intending to use them with this dollhouse; they were just bought for fun.  In fact, it wasn't until 6 months later or so that it occurred to me that they might be an okay fit in the house.  Well, they weren't an "okay" fit - they fit perfectly!  That solved problems one and two.  PlayMobile has just about anything you could want and a huge variety of styles of furniture, appliances, dish sets (!) - not to mention that you can create a family of people that looks exactly like your own (or whatever you want). We don't have any PlayMobil cars, so I don't know if they would fit in the garage.  (I suspect they might be too big.)  I've also uploaded two customer images of the dollhouse opened up with the PlayMobile furniture and people, as well as some of the wooden furniture that came with the dollhouse - you can mix and match!  With the discovery that PlayMobil products fit in the dollhouse, I only have good things to say about it.  We love its small size and "carrying" feature.  Out of the box, it's a bit plain, but if you think of it as a blank template, the cool thing is that you can turn it into whatever you and your kids want it to be. :)	1
I searched diligently for a dollhouse I could use myself, for thinking about fiction plots. I don't have a lot of space, didn't want to spend too much money, wanted something that would not fall apart, and needed to be able to put it out of reach of my curious dogs.  Buying a dollhouse and then buying furniture separately, oh my, the sky is the limit on expense. That might be lots of fun in a different situation, but not good for mine.  Then I find this dollhouse from Melissa & Doug, a company whose products I trust, and good information about it online. All wood, except I suppose the hair on the two dolls! But all the furniture and the house, wood, wood, wood. It folds easily and fits on a shelf, presto. The garage door opens--what a hoot that is!!! And no batteries!  I just love this little dollhouse. Merry Christmas--to me!  UPDATE:  I've had this now for some months, and I use it every day! It is really well made, durable, and I've relocated it very easily a few times.  I found some different dolls I like better, and added a few pieces of wood to vary the furniture. I boughtt one inexpensive piece at a craft store. Of course I had to add a dog, too! And at Christmas I added a Christmas tree, made of pipe cleaners and beads.  My husband looks at it now and then to see what I'm doing with it. I bought a car at Toys R Us that fits into the garage, so his character leaves in it to go to work or on errands. And he and I both get into it at times, with the dog in the back seat.  This is really a great doll house. I am so glad I found it.	1
This dollhouse is great because it opens up for siblings and friends to play side by side together. The house itself seems pretty durable and is very cute! The garage door and front door that really open are a great touch. The dolls are nice and the furniture is nice and simple. I do like that there is not a lot of painted pieces. My sister and mom purchased Ryan's Room furniture to add to it. The Ryan's Room pieces are a bit bigger and higher quality. I imagine that we will replace the M&D furniture eventually with the RR, just due to space issues in the house. There isn't a ton of room to add other furniture sets, but you can get the grill set or the playground set or the pet set for outdoors, etc. Overall, I'm happy with it. My three year old likes to take all the furniture out and put it back in wherever, and my 5 year old likes to organize it all where it belongs. It's nicely transported from room to room, and neither child has had a problem with the handles not latching.	1
My girls; 4,3,&1 years old; received this for Christmas. It's been a hit. Nothing has broken, even when being played with by 5 horse crazy girls. I purchased Schleich horses to go with it, and most (just not the biggest draft type horses) fit perfectly inside. The animals that came with it are fine, but a few of them are pretty scary with orange/red eyes. The animals I remember coming with it were horse, pig, cow, dog, and turkey. HTH 2008: We've had it now for more than 4 years and it is still played with by our now 8, 7, 5, 2, & 1 year olds. The hinge was finally torn, but was easily replaced. Holding up great. Dec 2016: Just ran across this review and wanted to add that we've had this barn over 13 years now! It's still played with by my younger two kids. We did have one hinge go wonky, so I went to Home Depot and bought some short screws and repaired it. It's holding up fine. I'm sure I'll have this for my grandchildren to play with.	1
This barn is really nice. My kids will use this for years to come.	1
It's a nice concept, but some of the doors stick because of over-gluing. It was not hard to smooth the offending part down with a Dremel tool and get this barn into working order.  After about a year of infrequent play, the barn doors came off completely. Turns out that the glue I Dremeled off wasn't spatter or too generous a use of glue, it was the only thing holding the rail on. Again, not too hard to fix; but this barn will be seeing the next round of toy donations.  Funny story: The turkey seemed just the perfect weight to balance the buoyancy of a mylar balloon, so we tied it to the end of the string and took it outside. The kids thought it was awesome that the turkey was floating and not touching the ground. When the balloon drifted out from under the trees and into the sunlight, the buoyancy overcame the weight of Mr. Turkey, and they set off into the sunset. The kids had a blast watching him float off as far as the eye could see! I just hope the balloon landed some place where it would get noticed and thrown away and not end up in the woods somewhere because of our careless mistake.	-1
Kids love it so far, bit it arrived with a broken handle	-1
Purchased for grandson. He loves it.	1
Happy 4 year old. Received from "Santa" to go with his horse trailer and other farm toys. Nice size, folds up, sturdy quality. It is packed in the box very tight. Or son was so excited Xmas morning that he kept yanking on the handle while the barn itself was caught on the lip of the cardboard. Handle ended breaking off. Easily fixed w some glue. Avoid the hassle and have an adult unbox it. Very good quality that we have come to expect from Melissa&Doug toys.	1
This is well made and an awesome toy. Great for my kids.	1
This is so much cuter in person. Bought for my daughter who loves animals. She is 4 and she loves to play with it. I love the wood quality of this oppose to the normal cheap plastic so many toys are made from.	1
It's held up well! My kids are rough. Lots of room for animals.	1
Very nice, first one arrived broken, but was immediately replaced.	1
We live out in the country & we have a small red barn here and when the grandkids come visit They love playing outside and the red barn is by the swingset.  So they have fun memories connected to red barns!  I purchased this for my grandson and his sisters so they will remember their fun times here on the farm... plus who doesn't love a red barn and toy animals!?!  Our grandson was so excited when we got it for him last Christmas... So that's almost a whole year!  He still loves it! I was at their house last week and I checked the barn out and it's in perfect shape and there isn't anything broken in that whole time... So I thought I'd come back and update my review!  He loves to carry it to a quiet spot or in the middle of chaos...  and lay on the floor and play make believe with the animals and I also found some figurines of country people.  A girl holding a doll and a couple of men doing chores and a couple ladies too! His sisters love playing with it as well and it's been one of their favorite toys this last year! I've added a few animals here and their to update their playing experience.  I love that it opens up to a bigger play area and then can fold up and be put away neatly! Melissa &  Doug didn't disapoint really well made and fun barn!! I feel Playing with toys makes children well rounded and intelligent.  Too many kids have forgotten how to play without a device or screen!  Playing games and watching a small amount of TV is okay for now and then...but not endless hours watching TV or games on phones and tablets!  I have seen many tantrums being stilled by handing over the parents devices to solve the situation instead of teaching them consequences and learning how to behave and what's acceptable behavior. Back in the old days.. (The 80's & 90's) When my kids were young and they had a meltdown in a store or on the floor... I actually had to talk to my child and figure out what was wrong or why they were upset... And if I couldn't settle them down... We actually walked out of stores or they were put in time out to learn what wasn't acceptable behavior at home or away!  When I see children crying and having meltdowns at stores... perhaps they are tired or want a toy or candy... The child is often quieted (is that a word)  by the parents phone so they can play a game to distract them into behaving and not to embarrss the parents.  I'm not sure what type of adults these children will turn out to become...but I hope they will be able to deal with real life situations!  Okay off my soapbox... Just went off the road there!! My point being that toys that inspire kids to use their creative skills and curiosity to play and stay planted in the real world will help your children and grandchildren to learn about life and not living in some fantasy game or TV program.  I think there is a little room for Games &  TV as there are skills they can learn from these things.  I just think this generation has too much of it and needs much more make believe.... With barns &  animals, dolls &  playhouses and swings and playing outside. This barn helps create that county living and playing with animalsto pretend to feed &  water them and have them make noises the animals would make.. Even counting how many horses or pigs they have.  This is a great addition to any kids life!  So hopefully this review was helpful in your decision whether this is a high quality barn for the little's in your life!  This is super sturdy and has been used by a 3 year old and his sisters for almost a year and has seen endless hours of play!! If it was helpful to you... Please click **Yes** below! Thanks and Happy Shopping! =)	1
My 4 year old daughter LOVES this! She uses all of her animals with it. It is so simple, which I love because it doesn't have batteries, buttons, etc.  The handle on top is awesome because you can carry it around. Melissa and Doug doesn't disappoint!!	1
My three year old loves his barn. Well built, also nice that it came with some animals.	1
My husband and I purchased this barn for our daughter as a Christmas present and it has been loved and played with daily since. The quality and construction of this barn is well worth it! It's very sturdy and not like cheap press board garbage. The paint is durable and the hinges on the gates have held up well. I would recommend this to any one in search of a barn for many hours of "farming adventure".	1
I ordered this because I know Melissa and Doug's reputation and we already own so many of their toys. Then I read the reviews and got very nervous. I'm glad I read the reviews after I ordered it because my son would've missed out on his favorite toy. This barn is excellent quality, just as one would expect from Melissa and doug. We've had it for 3 months now and it hasn't come unhinged or cracked like other reviewers have reported. I have 3 boys and they're not super rough with their toys but they're not that gentle either. All 3 of them love opening it up and playing with it. The animals that came with it are great quality too. My 2 year old even carries the horse and dog with him wherever he goes. I am very happy with this product and would buy it again.	1
Nice toy.	1
Totally worth it!	1
Awesome farm set. True to size the animals are perfect size. Very well made. I would recommend this item.	1
Fabulous quality!	1
I initially ordered this product and when I received it the hinge was crooked, the handles were crooked, and it didn't fold properly.  I was so disappointed because I know that Melissa and Doug make such high quality products.  That same day I requested a return on Amazon and they immediately shipped out a new one and paid for the return shipping of the bad barn.  I got the new barn just a few days later.  It was perfect with everything on it working as it should.  The quality is amazing and the amount of fun little spaces in the barn inside are so cool! The swinging and sliding doors worked flawlessly and the carrying handle make it so much easier to carry around.  Any kid could get lost playing with this toy for hours.  Amazon returns made it so nice and easy to exchange my product.  I'm always shopping here in the future because of the no-hassle return.	1
A classic	1
This is great. Bought it as a Christmas gift for our farm animal loving 3 year old daughter. But sadly the hinge that holds the two parts of the barn together has failed. :-(. We hadn't attempted to fix it yet but we're hoping we can do this ourselves with a little time and wood glue and tools.	1
Great barn.  Well made.  Love Melissa & Doug items.	1
The kids will play with this for a good hour! Great quality.	1
Love this!!  I got it for my 2 year old son for Christmas and both him and his 6 year old brother love playing with it.  The doors open and close, and there's a bunch of different pens for the different animals, it seems pretty durable also.	1
My son got this for Christmas and loves it!! There are so any compartments and doors to use! My only complaint is the sliding doors stick sometimes otherwise the quality is great.	1
MY GRANDSON (3) WILL LOVE THE ANIMALS AND THE BARN. I GOT THESE FOR HIM FOR CHRISTMAS. THE ANIMALS WERE WONDERFUL.	1
Purchased this barn for a granddaughter who loves farm animals.  When the barn came, I couldn't stop playing with it! The animals that come with it are kind of cheesy but Melissa & Doug sell a great box of horses that I purchased too and the horses are very authentic looking. The barn is well made, opens easily and will add many hours of imagination fun after Christmas. Excellent product and will update after the holidays!  Update:  The Barn was a big hit! Our granddaughter loved it and is still playing with it and the additional horses I purchased.  It's well constructed and I am extremely pleased with it and so Happy that she loved it!  Highly recommend this Barn for young children who adore farm animals!	1
Very nice wood construction with lots of room inside for creative play. Very happy with the barn. Bigger than I thought it would be.	1
Love it....I think my 4 year old will love it.....	1
This is a great toy that both of my kids enjoy (18 months and 3).  It's sturdy and a good size.  My 18 month old just likes to put the animals in all of the different stalls etc. and my 3 year old is able to make up stories, have the animals interact, etc.  It's basically exactly what it looks like :)	1
My 1.5 yr old loves this barn. She plays with it her own way, taking the animals in and out. Putting the animals on her sit n spin. Handing the animals to me and I make the animal sounds. Beautiful barn. Decent deal	1
I bought this barn for my nephew for a Christmas gift.  Was a great gift.  My nephew did not even finish opening his other gifts because he was so excited about his barn.	1
My 3.5 year old horse crazy daughter LOVES this barn.  She got it for Christmas and has been playing with it non stop.  It has barn doors that slide open and stall doors with hinges.  Very neat barn for kids to play with.	1
Very disappointed. Very poor quality for the price. Wood is unfinished in places. It's rough and just invites splinters on tiny hands. The doors don't open and close easily. Mine actually arrived with a door that is completely stuck in place. It can't be slid open or closed. Had a very bad chemical odor when i opened it. Overall a very cheap product. I expected better from Melissa and Doug	-1
I picked up the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Melissa-Doug-Cutting-Food/dp/B000GKD09C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Melissa & Doug Cutting Food</a>&nbsp;for our daughter, and realized that the crate that comes with that set is the perfect scale to be used as a "corral" or fenced barnyard with this barn.  I thought I would share that tip with other M&D fans who want to add play value to the barn.	1
Ordered this barn for my nephew's birthday. He loves it! He's 2 years old. Very good quality construction.	1
Even more beautiful in person. It's superb quality, very nice barn. I got it for my two year old, who absolutely loves this barn. It folds up easily, it unfolds just as easily. It has plenty of space on the inside. Everyone comments on this barn when they come to my house and asks where I got it. The price was excellent for what I got and this very much exceeded my expectations.  Don't get any other, this one is perfect.	1
We had this on our Amazon wish list and I am so thankful that my girls (ages 2 & 3) received it as it has proved to be one of their favorites.  We recently had a birthday party and kids from ages 1 to 5 were all playing with the barn - it was quite the hit.  It's very compact in that it folds in half for storage which is great for everyday at my house or if we need to grab a toy to take with us to entertain them somewhere.  The girls love to take the animals in and out of it and drive tractors up to it and unload stuff into the barn.  It is very sturdy and well-constructed ... I have come to expect this from M&D products, but it's nice to not be disappointed.  Would definitely recommend.	1
My 5yo loves this barn. We have it always out on his bedroom floor and he plays with it constantly even after a year. This one is a classic and is very well made.	1
I purchased this barn for my daughter's 3rd birthday. It's a really nice barn. My daughter and 5 yr old son both play with this barn EVERYDAY. In addition to the included animals, I purchased a bag of farm animals from Target for $5 that are a perfect fit. Great for imaginitive play.	1
My 2 1/2 year old son who loves animals absolutely adores this little barn!  Even though he doesn't have a long attention span (barely one at all!), he will spend lots of time with the barn and the little animals that come with it.  He loves opening and closing the doors and talking to the animals.  It's been very sturdy as he has climbed and stood on it several times.  The little 2-piece fence did break off, but could be glued back on easily.  The rest of it hasn't even flinched. ;)	1
You can't go wrong with this old favorite. These blocks get so much use!! My son is always playing with them! The only downfall is that they are a pain to put away since they really don't come in a great storage case.	1
I bought these for my 2 year old grand daughter for Christmas.  They are well made and sturdy.  I like them and I'm happy with my purchase.	1
Blocks smaller than I thought, but still a hit with 4 year old who is just learning his letters and numbers. He also combines them with his wood blocks as supports for larger blocks.	1
To keep your My first leap pad together with out damage, I would definitly get this bag, it is perfect for them to take 3 books and 3 cartridges out with them for the ride.	1
Would prefer the large size blocks. Too small for little hands.	-1
Cute.  I was disappointed when I realized they are only 1" cubes, but they work.  Also wish there were more than 4 colors.  But there are images on each side of the block so they will be helpful in teaching letters, animals, and objects.  I use them for monthly pictures of my infant's age and weight.	1
This pinata holds A LOT of candy and toys!  Very durable and cute.  My two year old played with it for days after the party.  Definitely a good buy.	1
These blocks are way too small!!	-1
It never opened. We had to use the pull string method and none of them pulled it to open. He had to break it open. Sad for the kids.	-1
There are blocks with A on it but the other side of that same block has an ice cream cone and totally understand related to 'A' items. So frustrating	-1
These blocks are really terrible. I feel disappointed n Melissa and Doug. I feel like there was no thought whatsoever put into them. There is no reasoning behind the way the blocks are labeled, they are way too small, and the print not done well. Super disappointing. I really wanted traditional good old fashion blocks. And these are far from it. We ended up finding some at Walmart that were just right. I am sure Amazon sells nice ones as well. But please don't waste your money on these. I thought because they are Melissa and Doug the quality would be there. Don't make that same mistake.	-1
Im pretty sure these blocks came from China. Not all the same size. Used them on a project. But if for a toddler, I'd make sure they don't mouth them due to possible lead paint.	-1
Cheap blocks, that arrived splinter d with the paint chipped and not even close to a complete alphabet. My kid can't even play with these. Usually Melissa and Doug roducta are reputable but don't waste your money on these blocks.	-1
I was excited about buying this product for my son, until it arrived! It's cheaply made, paint is coming off. Wood is splintered and breaks off. Have only owned for 2days. They are junk. Save your money.	-1
These are SUPER TINY. We bought them for my 18 month old because he loves to build with blocks. Would not recommend due to the size. Also, we've noticed the paint has started coming off and has stained some clothing.	-1
They are incredibly small - 1" square - maybe good for someone's craft project.  As far as we are concerned, these blocks are the final sign of Melissa and Doug's further decline in quality and we won't be buying this brand again.	-1
I like this product but they are too small for the 2 year olds I work with. If they were larger It would work better!	-1
These are way smaller than I thought they would be, I also thought they would be better quality coming from Melissa and Doug. I like the ones I bought at Walmart better. Also the bag is horrible it has a wrap around and Velcro feature, however, it will not wrap around and close with all the blocks in it. The bag is way too small.	-1
The letters don't match the images and they are too small to really stack or play with. They are also really lightweight and feel flimsy for a wooden block. Not the usual Melissa and Doug quality.	-1
Be careful if the child puts them in their mouth the painted part will come off	-1
These things are tiny.	-1
I really disliked these, so I returned it. The blocks have too many things on them. Its not one letter per block, there's a letter on one side and many different things that have nothing to do with that letter on the other sides. You would think that with the letter "A" they would put things on the blocks that start with the letter A, but no. Not at all. Its just random things. Plus, there are multiples of every single block, at least 5 of the same blocks of every color. What? Most of the print/ink/drawings were very faint and wearing off, they totally looked used. This is just a bad quality product.	-1
One star. I didn't purchase these but I received them today as a Christmas present. They're small, and can cause splinters. Some look damaged, others are in good shape and other have splits in them. I wouldn't recommend. Melissa and Doug is a great company, failed making this toy.	-1
These are not great quality.  The paint was chipped and inconsistent.  They are also way to small for a young child to stack on top of each other.  I was disappointed, because Melissa and Doug is usually really good quality and well thought out for young kids.  These blocks are neither.	-1
Missing parts !!!	-1
Came today, we'll return tomorrow. The quality wasn't up to par on this one. Paint was really rough on the inside of rings. Doubt it would hold up to banging, throwing and playing. We have many great Melissa & Doug items, but this isn't one of them.	-1
We had to order 3 of these to get one that wasn't so swollen that the rings would come off. I couldn't even get the rings off the first one. It wasn't a paint issue. The second one was ok, but it wasn't easy for my little one to push them on at all. The colors are great and the 3rd one we received was great.	-1
I usually love Melissa & Doug toys. They have a very nice aesthetic that is much less objectionable than a lot of the plasticky "Krap for Kidz" that's out there. However the spike on this is frighteningly sharp and narrow and I'm afraid my kid will fall on it and either impale herself or put out an eye. That's too bad because it certainly is nicer than the plastic ones. I'll buy from them in the future but this toy was a swing-and-a-miss.	-1
I loved Melissa and Doung toys...but was disappointed with this toy. All the rings weren't painted all the way through and the bottom purple ring's hole is too small, so it permanently stuck at the bottom of the toy. My girl is a little OCD so she get so frustrated that she can't get all the rings off the pole. I decided to just eat the cost and not return it because it is more hassle to return it. So if you buy this just know you may or may not be getting a functional toy.	-1
One of the four pieces is in a different shade of blue!	-1
Beware.  There is something on these mats that will leave hard floor surface extremely slippery.  Left my hard wood floor like ice.  I washed one with dish soap and still the same.  I bought directly from Step2 and will return them.  Also, from the mfg website FAQ "Can these play mays be used on wood flooring?  We suggest care should be taken to avoid using these mats on surfaces that can be discolored by foam mats.  We recommend that you check with your flooring manufacturer for specific recommendations or restrictions."  I don't know what is coating these mats that makes the floor so slippery but it is dangerous.  Again, I suggest you avoid this product, it is hazardous.	-1
My kids have played with it for less than a week and the blocks look months old.  Chunks of wood missing, paint chipping, they just look nasty.  Very small blocks are great for small hands but these are not good quality.	-1
No all the Items  on the package very disappointed	-1
MUCH SMALLER THAN EXPECTED	-1
Horrible. Paint chipped off in large chunks straight out of the package. Not a safe toy for babies.	-1
Got this as a gift, but was not impressed. The orange circle is small enough that my son was almost able to get it in his mouth. The most scary thing about it is it's narrow pole that they all stack on to. It seems so dangerous. Also, the paint began to chip after my son was playing with these several times and getting drool on them. Just not a very good toy.	-1
I guess it is my fault for not reading closer - but this thing is SMALL. Like, small enough that there are points where I couldn't even tell which one was smaller. Right now it's an okay toy because I mainly just stack them and let my 4 month old daughter watch and hold the pieces. But when it is time to really start honing in on this milestone, we will have to purchase something with more obvious size differences. With that said - it is sturdy, beautiful, and a great quality. It was just a lot smaller than I thought.	-1
These blocks are really tiny. Not worth it in my opinion.	-1
Not for any kid under 13 honestly. It is sharp, dangerous and a hazard. Do not buy this...	-1
These blocks are a lot smaller than I remember my kids playing with... These are I believe 1"x1"... I was looking for the bigger ones.. still cute.... but will have to wait a bit before the grand baby can play with them..	-1
Smaller than expected, otherwise it is a sturdy product. Please note that the paint is water based, which makes no sense because babies put everything in their mouth and the saliva disolves the paint which in turn means that your child will have paint chips in his mouth.	-1
Tiny and paint chips off	-1
Great toy unfortunately mine started chipping and I was very upset my daughter may have ingested paint chips. Melissa and Doug was great, they sent replacement toys and apologized but I still wanted to head up other parents. Don't get this toy if there is any chance it will be on your babies mouth.	-1
These blocks are really cheaply made. You can see mistakes in the painting and the wood chips easily. I had to take them away from my daughter.	-1
Caution-! This toy is very poorly made, paint chips off of the rings, and the base is a safety hazard- a baby could easily poke their eye out on the stick. My 6 month old loves this toy, but I am throwing it away because of the above issues. When will the toy producers learn that babies take everything to their mouths, and therefore nothing should be toxic or chip off the product-??? Melissa and Doug claim to be health-conscious toy producers, but this product is just a shame. Don't buy it if you don't want your child eating paint.	-1
I have heard great things about Melissa & Doug toys (M&D) so I bought this stacker set and another M&D for my 6 month old son. The stacker rings chipped pretty badly with little play. Although M&D is an American company, their products are manufactured in China and the paint on their toys is said to contain LEAD. Do a google search for yourself about M&D and Lead paint and see for yourself. Stay Away!!!! There are some great European wooden toy companies out there that have higher standards than the US!	-1
I bought this for a Birthday Present and I am embarassed to give it to them since the paint is already chipped off this toy and it is not even opened yet and the Party is today and I have no choice but to give it to them and have them return it.	-1
My son really enjoys this toy but I recently noticed him chewing on one of the rings and flakes of orange color in his mouth. The color on the ring was chipping off in large chunks. It may just be a defective toy we got but just wanted to put that warning out there.	-1
My mother in law bought this toy for my son.  After playing with it once, it became clear that some of the rings were not solid wood but were held together by some kind of putty.  The putty was not resistant to water, so after my son put it in his mouth once, the paint clipped off and the putty became soft.  Luckily we noticed right away and threw away the rings that were not solid wood.  After playing with this toy for a week, the paint on all of the pieces began chipping off. I had to throw the entire product away! I must say I was shocked by all of this since Melissa and Doug has such a great reputation.  I was also shocked to see that a company with such a great reputation would have a huge spike in the center of their toy.  What a huge disappointment.  I replaced it with a similar product by Sprig, which is made of recycled plastic & reclaimed sawdust and has no center spike.  Each piece has a rattle in it and they join together with fun shapes.  My son loves it.  I will never ask for or purchase Melissa and Doug again. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sprig-Cone-Stacker/dp/B003TTM11K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sprig Cone Stacker</a>	-1
My 18 month old had outgrown some of his early stacker toys and really enjoys wooden toys so I thought this would be a good choice.  I have to say that although I have not had any trouble with paint or color coming off of the one we bought, I would probably not bought it after reading the reviews here.  That said, I have and NO problem.  My son throws the pieces (of course he does)and even when they hit the tile floor, I have seen no cracking or chipping.  The colors seem fast and do not rub off on any of hte other pieces.  My son really enjoys stacking these and we are enjoying going over the colors as he plays.  I will say that the red ball for the top is pretty hard for him to get on.  I would absolutely buy this again and am glad I got it.  I do not let my child play with it unattended or walk with the stick. I am afraid of him getting poked.  As an update, two of the rings have cracked and I have thrown it away for fear of pinching little fingers.	-1
Back before I actually had a kid, when I was insisting on natural materials only, I ordered the Melissa & Doug Rainbow Stacker, even though I'm not a fan of M&D toys as a rule (I find many of them to be cheaply made).  We got the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fisher-Price-Rock-A-Stack/dp/B00000IZQP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fisher-Price Rock-A-Stack</a>&nbsp;as a gift when Jackson was born, and I remember scoffing a little. "Plastic! Look at this silly thing with the ridiculous foil shiny thing inside the top ring. They couldn't even make it a real rainbow, they ruined it putting those dumb little balls in the top half of the red ring. And why does it rock?! What kind of ridiculous popcorn-button-on-the-microwave unnecessary extra feature is that?"  Of course, six months later, the Rock-a-Stack is the undefeated champion of playtime, and the Rainbow Stacker sits unused in the closet. Jackson loves the balls in the red ring, he likes to make it rock, he can actually get the rings off and play with them, and I don't worry one bit when he teethes on the fat, squat, yellow ring-holder-thingy in the middle.  The rings on the M&D stacker, on the other hand, are heavy and hard for him to lift and manipulate, the red ball rolls away (and reminds me of a scary clown nose), and I'm always worried he's going to gag himself when he tries to chew on the tall, skinny wooden stick in the middle.  The Rainbow Stacker might be a great toy for a three-year-old, but it's not a good fit for my baby at this stage.	-1
By the time my son had played with this for a while, the paint began chipping off!  There are little chips all over each ring and the top ball.  Honestly, he didn't even play with it that much.  So now, I'm tossing it out rather than handing it down to my daughter.  Such a shame, but I've found that most Melissa and Doug toys (all made in China!) just don't have the durability you would expect for the price.	-1
Be careful, the picture is not what I received. There were different pieces, less people and no trees... Not sure what I got but it was a smaller version of what this picture shows.	-1
The top piece, the blue one pictured, is small enough to be a choking hazard. Just FYI. We removed that piece and threw it away.  Also, the pole and the hole are small requiring really really good fine motor skills. For babies just learning this skill look for bigger poles and holes otherwise, it's really hard for them to do this one.	-1
Way to small. Double check measurements when buying items like this. It was my fault I didn't check the size. I just assumed since they were for babies they would be bigger then a choking hazard.	-1
They are smaller than they appear, and mine arrived with the paint chipping off multiple blocks. I saw a set of these yesterday in Walmart for a couple dollars less, they are bigger, and brighter colored. Without the paint chipping off. All around more appealing.	-1
These are so poorly made, I am SO disappointed. Nearly all of the blocks have extremely rough edges. Several of the blocks have cracks. Wood is also rather soft (not that I am going to be giving these to my child, due to the rough edges and splinters that would come from these!). COMPLETE waste.	-1
As others were, I was also very disappointed in the quality after becoming a fan of other Melissa and Doug products.  It seems like a product that goes against their company's mission. The paint application was very sloppy on many blocks and quite a few splinters.  Not worth any price.	-1
The corners on the blocks were too sharp for my twins when they were initially interested in playing with them. I was afraid they would fall over on them and cut themselves. Now that we are 2 years old, they are too small and slippery to stack with. The only part they like is talking about the pictures on them. Just not impressed and would look for a larger block if I bought some again.	-1
I've had such good experience with Melissa & Doug toys, so I was excited to find these blocks online.  They arrived today, an intended xmas present for my toddler.  They will not be given to him.  They are extremely small, about one inch cubes, and while I'm sure they would not pose a choking hazard due to their size, they are splintered,  chipped,  and the paint is flaking off on parts.  And while this is not a health hazard but a cosmetic one, the paint is blurry and bleeds from one side of the block to the other on some of them.  Too many of them are chipped,  splintered, smeared and cracked for me to be pleased at all with this purchase.  A shame, as I was really looking forward to my son's first set of blocks.	-1
I was excited to find these blocks online but was disappointed when I received them. Many blocks had areas that were missing paint. Some of the printed images were smudged or barely visible. One of blocks was even cracked. This is straight out of the box! I can understand them looking this way after a toddler has played with them for awhile but not brand new.	-1
A. They are SMALL!! WAY WAY WAY TO SMALL FOR ANY.CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF TWO!!  B. The materials used to make this crap is SOFT! WHO IN THERE RIGHT MIND THOUGHT SOFT BLOCKS WERE A GOOD IDEA!?  ARE YOU DAFT?  C. CHOKING HAZARD!!!! What teething child in the entire universe doesn't put everything it can grab into his/her mouth?! These blocks are an accident just waiting to happen! Are you serious K&D?!  D. Made in China. Say huh?!  E. JUNK!! I went to Babies r us and found wonderful wooden alphabet and picture blocks. They were $17 bucks. Do yourself a favor..DON'T SPEND HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!	-1
I was excited to find wooden blocks for my son who loves to build towers, but why would anybody make the blocks so small? Usually love Melissa & Doug products, but this was a disappointment.	-1
I was so excited when I found these blocks. I thought they were so cute and just what my son needed. When I received them many of the blocks had chucks missing around the corners and the colored lettering was chipped and fading. They are also ALOT smaller than I expected them to be. Overall this is a cheap disappointing product. I would not recommend to anyone.	-1
I can't help but feel misled by the size of the product.  But even knowing these are tiny blocks, they are NOT good for young toddlers.  First of all, if your toddler are mouthers in that they like to put it in their mouths, these blocks are tiny and soft so they get chewed up -- and become unsafe relatively quickly.  Emotionally they are frustrating for my little girl who has the hardest time stacking these blocks even thought she's great at stacking regular sized blocks.  She doesn't understand why she has trouble (I guess she hasn't reasoned that the proportions are different).  They look nice with nice colors and pictures but that's all.  It's not good for young toddlers, and I can't imagine older children playing with it.  I wouldn't even feel comfortable giving these away.  Straight in the garbage with this one.	-1
I'm very disappointed in these blocks. I knew they were going to be small from other reviews but there was not a single colored "y" in the entire set. Since I need these for newborn pictures and our baby may have a "y" in his/her name I will be returning them for a different brand.	-1
I never would have purchased this product had I actually seen the 1-inch sizing on the description before making the purchase! Why would anyone make a classic and advertise it as "deluxe" for it to only be the tiniest little wooden blocks that can't be anywhere near a child because of the choking hazard?! These are for crafting or something other than for child's play!	-1
I bought these for my twins when they were around 2. Right out of the package I noticed the cheap quality of them. The paint was chipped off in several spots, and the wood was slivered off in the corners on multiple blocks. I immediately put them back in the clear box they came in, and ended up throwing them away. I never even showed them to my kids because they were complete garbage! Don't waste your money on them. I thought Melissa and Doug was a great brand name, and that's why I ordered them. But I do not recommend them at all. Wood and paint are cheap!	-1
Would have been a great nativity set for my child except what is pictured is not was shipped.  It didn't come with the extra walls, trees and cart for the donkey but mine was also missing a wise man and Joseph.  Not acceptable for the amount I paid.  Sending it back.	-1
Know what you are buying.  I expected these to be 2-inch blocks, but they are 1-inch square.  Too small for my taste.  I didn't pay attention because I didn't know they made them this small.  I am sending them back and getting the big blocks.	-1
Nothing "Deluxe" here - these are low-quality, tiny poorly finished blocks made in China (like all of Melissa & Doug's products, apparently). The paint came off quickly, but it is really the tiny size that is most disappointing. I wondered why the price was so cheap; I guess I understand now!	-1
This product does not come as pictured on the website which I find extremely disappointing and misleading.  There are several pieces pictured that are not part of the set.  My daughter has several little people sets which are all made of a sturdy plastic.  This set has a soft, almost rubbery plastic.  I point these issues out because, it feels as if this item is marked up just because it's a nativity scene, and that bothers me.  It's basically a bunch of people figures and a very cheap looking little barn, again much poorer quality than other little people things we've gotten. If, you just want a nativity that your baby can handle, this will fit the bill--Just keep in mind that it is not on par with other little people sets in terms of quality, and that you will not get what's in the picture.	-1
It looks like at one point you were selling what is pictures but that is no longer the case.  The package I received was very basic with none of the "additional pieces", no donkey with cart, and plays no music. VERY DISAPPOINTED	-1
This is not as ordered. False advertising. Does not play music and does not have all the pieces as advertised. This company needs business practices need to be examined by AMAZON. The item sent is a less expensive version of the product advertised so you will be overpaying for the item you receive. I am very disappointed and will send this product back. This Fisher Price Little People Christmas Story offering, is from Family Christian Stores fulfilled by Amazon	-1
Frustrating at first but once we were able to adjust the straps much easier.	-1
$68.25?? Toys R Us sells it for $29.99. And where did they get a list price of $79.99 from? Fisher Price's own website lists it at $33.00. Total rip off here at Amazon.	-1
The Nativity set is completely adorable and a great, kid-friendly, hands-on Christmas decoration to teach little ones the Nativity story.  My little man loves it...although he mostly loves running around with the pieces, but he'll appreciate it later!  However, it's much cheaper at Walmart.com and Toys R Us.com.  (Currently, $24.99 compared to Amazon.com's $47.99)  From my searches, it looks like most of the Fisher Price items on Amazon.com are similarly over priced.  I e-mailed Customer Service but they pretty much said to buy it elsewhere.  Anyway, to sum it up: great toy but don't buy it here!	-1
This product is fun and enjoyable, but it's way overpriced here.  It's on clearance at ToysRUs for less than $30.  DO NOT GET RIPPED OFF HERE.	-1
After much research, I decided to purchase this seat.  I actually bought two, one for each car.  My 7 month old cried each time I put her in it.  The memory straps were much more of a problem than convenience.  I had a hard time each time I put her in or out of the seat.  Her arms would get caught between the loops.  I took both of them back and bought a cheaper seat that has the adjustable strap at the bottom of the seat.  She no longer cries each time I take her for a ride.	-1
I ordered two of these.  One worked great.  The other didn't work at all.	-1
Came broken and the sticker around it all messed up. I guess you get what you pay for.	-1
Nice wood train whistle but there is no way a young child can blow it.  My three year old is unimpressed.	-1
Very hard for a child to blow this whistle	-1
i've had better quality train whistles.  needs a little more effort to blow to get a good sound out.	-1
My son likes it. It works pretty good. Although its just a wooden whistle with a cheap sticker wrapped around it. Can't complain about the price though.	-1
It's ok it works well but the "stickers/ paper" that covers the wood i do not think will last all that long with my kids. It's ok for the price but still would not waist another $5.00 on this.	-1
Our item doesn't work. I knew the picture on it was a sticker,but didn't think I'd be constructed cheaply too. Seems multiple people have the same problem. I guess getting this item you risk get to  a faulty one. My daughter didn't even try it because if my husband and I couldn't get it to make a noise I knew it would be impossible for her. I hope we can return this,but we will see.	-1
Very disappointed.  I have a 2 year old that LOVES Thomas and this would have been a stocking suffer.  Disgusting, really.	-1
I would love this if I received it, but I did not	-1
Wish each fish had a different shape because you can easily put a pink one on a yellow base as they are all the exact same shape.	-1
my daughter has a few of these wooden puzzles and loves them.  this one, on the other hand, falls a little short in comparison.  the puzzle pieces are cheap and very thin, the knobs to grab the pieces are tiny and cheap as well.  all the puzzle pieces are the same, the only difference being the color.  on top of that it is only a small center section of each fish that lifts off, so on its own it is nothing, whereas some of the puzzles will have animals, so if the piece isn't on the puzzle, its a little wooden dog.  this one didn't hold her interest for a minute	-1
Typical Revell/Monogram junk.  New afterburner cans and a chin pod does not an F-14D make.  This is just the same-old F-14A kit from the 80s repackaged with a handfull of new pieces (well, maybe a really, really small hand).  Unless you're just looking for something to throw together in a hurry to have a general shape of a Tomcat, steer clear of this one.  Drop and extra $20 and pick up the quality Hasegawa kit.  The fit is a bit of a nightmare, but it makes an awesome display.	-1
So I was actually given this model by a friend, he had tried to build it 7-8 years ago and never finished because of the awful instructions.  And my word, are the instructions bad. Colors are totally wrong, there's a huge error in the decaling of the starboard side of the fuselage, and paint schemes aren't consistent from page to page. Plus the decals: limited, old (I ordered replacements and had an awful time with Revell Customer Service, cancelled that and bought a newer set off ebay..... And while better, they were still overall just too thick and stained by the backing paper. Jacked decals from the F-4 Phantom kit for small replacements), basically complete trash.  But anyways, I undid most of his work, which was the intakes, cockpit, and pilot, plus some old acrylic paint, and started fresh. I had everything assembled in two days, but putty was a must. I didn't have issues with the mobile wings at all, but getting the plane together around them was tough. After I got it lined up I still had to do intense clamping for it to stay that way. I found the landing gear doors to be really aggravating and unstable as well. The rack for the Phoenix's was a bunch of guesswork to get in place, and the Phoenix's themselves were marred by significant seams.  But all that I fixed. And painted. And was happy with. But to achieve an outcome I was happy with was farrr too much work, if it wasn't a freebie I would have felt cheated. I'd pay three times as much as retail for a more interesting, better decaled, clearer instructioned, crisply fitting kit. Many thing wrong on this. The F-4C is leagues ahead in quality if you want a 1:48 Navy Fighter with a significant history.	-1
Disappointing. This was not as intuitive or easy as I had anticipated for two bright 7 year olds who like things like this. Priduct also seemed cheap. We will be returning it.	-1
My kids didn't care for them & I bought 3 different sets	-1
I bought two boxes. each one has defective parts. im going to return them for sure,	-1
returned	-1
My kids got this for Christmas 2 weeks ago and we are already giving it away to charity.  It is very cheap feeling and the doors or almost impossible for me to open.  The storage for the tracks is not large enough unless you put them in JUST right.  We also have another of these playsets and it is the same, just not enough fun for the trouble or cheapness.  Now, I DO like the take along trains and tracks.  My kids just don't need to add the badly made playsets to the tracks to have fun.  I'd take a pass if I were you.	-1
I purchased this toy for my grandsons when they were 11 months and 8-1/2 months. Three months later they are still uninterested. The balls are very difficult to push through the holes. Even when I help them, my grandsons are not interested in watching. I suppose, as with most toys, some children will be entertained by it while others are not.	-1
This toy requires you to POUND the ball really hard.  I'm not sure I want my 1 year old to learn to hit ANYTHING with a hammer that hard.  I'm putting it away (it was a gift) for a year and then we'll see.  I'm super bummed b/c it looked like it would be so much fun.	-1
These cups stink, there's no other way to put it.  The first thing that I noticed when we got one was that they have so many parts to remove and clean.  Our daughter also has not taken to it at ALL.  She will drink from any other brand of sippy cup that I give her (Gerber, Playtex and Take n Toss) but not this one.  I think the spout is too long.  We have an assortment of all of these brands but I would recommend the Take n Toss anyday.  They are cheap, durable (we've been using the same ones for over 6 months, including washing them in the dishwasher everytime), and best of all, there are no valves to clean or have make sure they don't get moldy.  My advice is avoid the Avent unless you miraculously have tons of extra time on your hands (with a toddler?  yeah, right!).	-1
These Avent cups are very, very durable and put up with a lot of abuse from any overactive toddler.  They've fallen off the roof of my car, rolled down stairs, etc. without incident.  The parts are interchangeable with other Avent products, which is a big plus.  But they leak from time to time where the cap screws onto the bottle.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to this pattern of leakage, but having milk/juice/tea/water run down a toddler's hands and arms is no fun to clean.  And cleaning these things can be a real pain.  The caps are composed of 5 parts that are nearly impossible to remove once they or your hands are wet.  The tapered clear caps are especially difficult to pull off unless your hands are made of sticky tape or sandpaper.	-1
My children loved this toy a lot--they had lots of fun with it and two and three-year-olds especially love watching the cars go down.  Younger children many need assistance as you have to line the wheels up with the track for it to work.  But it was not very well made!  Both the stand itself and several of the cars broke even though I supervised my children while they played with it and they did not abuse it.  Other manufacturers make similar toys--I plan to replace this with another brand.	-1
The only good thing about this sipper cup is the plastic cover.  There are seven pieces in all.  That means seven pieces to wash, seven pieces to sterilize, seven pieces to dry, and seven pieces to assemble.  What a hassle, it's not worth the effort. (...)	-1
Being new to this toy, I didn't realize that I ordered only the software. I ordered 2 types of My First LeapPad Software but no LeapPad to play it on. I live in the caribbean, so I couldn't just go into a store and buy it. Whatever I ordered and didn't order that time was it, for the next 6 months---until my next visit to the continent. Amazon should advertise for those who don't know while ordering for grandchildren or other children, or even into a new age group like myself, that you need the LeapPad for this. Needless to say, it stayed in its package for a very long time without use.	-1
I bought this as a project to do with my five year old. She liked it. However, the magnets are SMALL. Even smaller than what is pictured on the box. Also, when we hung them on the refrigerator, the magnets stuck to the fridge and the "glass" (which is plastic) fell to the floor. I guess I'll have to glue the magnets on.	-1
This clay stains clothes and hands, leaves greasy stains on paper - can also be sticky and hard to remove from objects.	-1
These don't work as water color pencils at all. I thought I could use to make coloring sheets for my toddler to water paint and no. Just no. They are bright and smooth if just used as colored pencils though but I feel they are expensive for that use. I won't purchase these again. I have never been so disappointed in a Crayola product.	-1
Warning! This chalk stains everything! The dust smears everywhere and it's very hard to scrub from laminate flooring, so far impossible to get out of carpet and clothing, and I had to use comet and a scrubbing sponge to wash the colors out of my sink after trying to wash it off my hands! Our hands and nails were stained all day. This also won't erase from our chalkboard (paint) wall. I have to wash it with water and "re-prep" the board with white chalk to cover the markings. This is terrible. I'm very disappointed. The chalk and colors are pretty themselves but this is for a permanent project and you'll want to use it outside while wearing paint clothes. Super messy. I'd be afraid to let kids use it outside - might need acid to remove it from the driveway! Plus, every piece was broken when it arrived.	-1
These were awful.  Definitely not dust free!	-1
Came in pieces and seems to shatter easier than regular chalk. I wish it were easier to find chalk when it's not back-to-school season, or else I wouldn't be trying to get it to survive the shipping process.	-1
it came partially broken, and they break very easily	-1
The chalk was super dusty.  So much for anti-dust.	-1
came broken into crumbs	-1
Ah, kinda a rip off.	-1
Don't know if it's just me, but there was still white chalk dust coming off this chalk. Don't expect this to be dust free.	-1
what can i say chalk is chalk. however when we received this package ALL the chalk was broken. very unfortunate and i should have know better and went to a store and bought this.	-1
Works but I prefer a little more flow of the colors when you wet them otherwise, decent set and as mentioned in an earlier review, the pencil "lead/color" does seem harder/firmer than most.	-1
While this is a fun toy for little ones, I wouldn't use it in the bath. There is a screw on the bottom of the largest pail that rusted the first time we used it, which doesn't make it suitable for water in my opinion!  It is also VERY heavy, my daughter has never had trouble with the weight but it's far too fun for them to throw at innocent bystanders like the kitty, daddy giving them a bath, or your glass door. This toy could do some serious damage.	-1
My daughter rarely played with this toy.	-1
I don't like these blocks. My daughter doesn't really play with them, they only catch her eyes, but when you give her she looses interest very soon, she is 12 months old now. These blocks are also very heavy for little kids and at some point they are not as safe, because of their corners	-1
My 10 month old wanted nothing to do with this toy.	-1
Neither of our children ever showed any more then a passing interest in these guys. I think partly that they are little difficult for really small children to push down on and make spin or move.	-1
This is meant for a baby/toddler toy but I don't get why at all.  I had 3 different kids under 2 play with these and none of them could really push the head down when they were all stacked up.  The stickers also come off really easily and can be eaten by a small child.  My daughter ate part of one.  I don't think this toy was designed well.  Small hands can't really manipulate these.	-1
I loved the idea of this science-y toy,  but both my husband and I fought with this thing trying to put it together.  Once it was all in one piece it felt flimsy like the handle would come off and fly in your face.  Pulling back the elastic is difficult, so this isn't something I would recommend for someone younger than maybe 10.  Is more trouble than it's worth for the novelty of this idea.	-1
My product arrived damaged so I can't rate it accurately, but I didn't like the size or the item at all.	-1
The batteries were dead out of the box so the musical key has never worked. Also the Ring separates so the keys do not stay on the ring at all. My son is 7 months old and has sown no interest in these whatsoever. They are also VERY big! One key is almost the size of my hand.	-1
This one broke on the first pull.  I have owned two of these as a school teacher and used the others for several years.  I ended up ordering a blue one from a company on the west coast and am still using it 6 months later.	-1
I recently bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew, and received it in the mail today. When I pulled the airzooka out of the box it was shipped in, I saw that the box (I bought it new) was destroyed, like a mouse or something at a large chunk out of the container. The box it was shipped in, and the other product I got were in good condition, so I know it didn't occur while it was being shipped. Overall, I'm really disappointed. I wanted a nice box to wrap up for my nephew. I'll be returning this asap.	-1
The crane looks great, but it is flimsy and hard to operate. I give it a life span of less than a month. It is not worth the money.	-1
Every Bruder vehicle I've bought for my kids is broken to some degree; this one within 2 days. I feel like these toys are built for adult collectors who are just going to put them on a shelf for display. The realistic proportions and working parts are cool but with this intricacy comes fragility. A lot of the working components, like the moving "hydraulic" parts, are thin plastic pieces that inevitably break, rendering the toy basically useless. Some parts are just clipped on and can pop off - like he top lights on this crane truck. The crank on this is also annoyingly loud.	-1
The truck looks great, but it is not sturdy. One wheel was easily broken off by my toddler.	-1
It's ok but not great. Usually we are big Bruder fans but this one falls short. The side legs are very hard to get on and off, they are not a great design and one broke. The elastic in the raising arm has broken twice now - the second time within 2 weeks of buying a new replacement. It is not getting any unusual play and is not left out in the elements, there's no reason for it to break. I hesitate to replace it again since it broke so fast.	-1
The AirZooka may be a *little bit* of fun for a very young child, but overall it's a pretty disappointing toy.  I have to wonder if the people who seem to have had a great experience with this toy actually were able to purchase one pre-assembled.  That's because once all the pieces are together, this toy may hold the interest of some kids.  But putting this toy together reveals how poorly designed and fragile it is.  And personally I really didn't see the point once we did get it assembled.  One of my nephews received a pair of these on Christmas Eve.  Good thing he got a pair because only one survived.  I, and several of my cousins, undertook the rather embarrassing endeavor of trying, and failing to correctly assemble these.  It quickly turned into a joke along the lines of "how many engineers does it take to assemble a simple children's toy."  The unit is made of three concentric rings, as you can see from the product picture, that must be extended before you can attach the handle and a sight.  The two attachments are kind of shaped like christmas trees, but have some small tabs that are supposed to attach to the rings.  These tabs are VERY fragile and be warned, if you break one of the 4 there is virutally no way to attach the handle.  And without the handle, it's impossible to use this toy for what it's meant to be used.  The three rings collapse into themselves if you try to just hold onto them and pull the air bag without the handle attached.  Somehow we were able to at least get one of these put together.  The pay-off was very anti-climactic for me.  There's a plastic bag inside the AirZooka that you can pull on and release to shoot a concentrated gust of air.  I suppose if you caught somebody off guard it might be funny.  But how long can that joke be re-used?  My nephew seemed to enjoy it OK, but after 15 minutes had moved on to his other toys.  Considering three of us messed with this thing for 30 minutes to get it to work, the pay-off just didn't seem worth it.  I also have to wonder how safe this toy is.  If that rubber band were to break free, I could see the bag and pully being launched at somebody.  I am surprised that others seemed to love this toy.  To me, the poor quality was strike one.  While some kids will find sneaking up on people with this to be fun for a little while, this also seems like a one-trick pony.  For me that joke would get old fast.  If you haven't removed yours from the box yet, exchange it for something else.  And if you are considering this, I definitely do not recommend it at any price.  Good luck.	-1
The cement mixer arrived with a broken axle.  I ordered four trucks of different types for my grandchild. When I saw them, I was very disappointed. They are made of cheap plastic and lack durability. DO NOT BY THESE PRODUCTS. I can only think that the positive reviews are hoaxes.	-1
I returned this for the Bruder Mac Granite Cement Mixer which is awesome. This truck was disappointing because it is just a plastic truck. I wasn't realistic. The doors don't open and the side mirrors are soft bendable plastic. I was very unimpressed.	-1
Truck broke without rough play-made of plastic-plastic that cracks easily and parts break off-this was not played with rougly or by a baby would never purchase bruder toys again we purchase ours through 2nd party seller-they made good on purchase asap-it arrived with torn box and toy had been used-also brochure was not in box..thank goodness for the excellent seller	-1
My kids saw a video of it on youtube, and I have to admit it looked really fun. Santa gave our soon-to-be 3-year-old truck lover this mixer for Christmas. He loves it. But it's a nightmare for us. First we tried water, and it got everywhere. Then we tried rice; it made such a mess. Moving furniture to clean up all the rice is  quite some work we can go without on Christmas day. Finally we decided to take it to the park, and he and our 8-year-old girl had a lot of fun playing with it in the sandbox. However, to clean it up so that he can have it indoor again is a lot of work. All in all, kids who love trucks may find it fun, but maybe we have not figured out a way to play with it without making too much extra work for parents. We are waiting for him to lose interests and then we can hide it away. The truck is not as sturdy as I thought from reading some of the comments. The plastic is rather thin. The gas pipe thingy fell off within an hour. The pieces of the chute keep coming off. It is not helping that we bought it at full price and now it is half price. Very disappointed overall. But again, kids do like it.	-1
Cheaply made, not what I expected from a German Made Toy. But my 4 Year Old loves it	-1
This had a bad chemical smell when it arrived. I had to air them out for days. I regret this purchase	-1
This product reeks of chemicals and would undoubtedly be in my toddler's mouth in seconds. Also, I expected a travel bag or something to contain the pieces. Unfortunately this bad purchase is entirely my fault for not reading every 1 star review!	-1
This toddler tote is okay. My toddler played with it for a few minutes and got bored. I am sure it probably helps with colors and sensory. My son did not find it engaging or challenging. I returned it.	-1
The "tote" wasn't made for toddlers to use. My two year old broke the flimsy cardboard box the first time he opened it. The foam pieces are cute, but they didn't hold his interest at all. And it was impossible to put all the pieces back into the tote easily.	-1
Terrible, terrible, terrible product. The main reasons are the pieces are too small and easily lost. I bought this for an airplane trip and it was such a pain always trying to find the pieces because they slipped through too easily on the main puzzle frame. Not worth the money.	-1
The "tote" is the box it comes in. I was under the impression that all the items would come with a travel tote, it does not. The tote is the crappy box it's packaged in. I would return it but my kids love the pieces inside. I have it stowed in a toddler backpack that I purchased separately. Also these are very small pieces, not very good for car travel with a two year old. They are the perfect size for getting lost forever in the crevices of your car. Maybe this would last longer with an older child with better motor skills. I'm disappointed.	-1
not impressed the box was ripped in 5 mins maybe recommend for 4-5 year old.	-1
I was disappointed with this product	-1
This was a huge disappointment.  I purchased this for a long plane ride for a 2 year old because of all the positive reviews... it held zero attention for my son.  Once taken out all the pieces don't fit back in correctly without lots of effort and it is flimsy.  The "puzzles" are only two pieces (way to easy for a toddler) and made of cheap foam.  I gave it two stars because the plastic pegs are nice thick plastic and perhaps we could find some way to play with them at home.	-1
Just so so. Didn't hold his interest longer than a few minutes on our trip,	-1
Some odd pieces in the tote. My son just seems to chew on the stuff. Easy to loose parts. Not sure if worth it yet	-1
Okay the kids like it, but way too many parts for the little ones to loose.. so we ended up tossing most of the set as parts were lost. On the pro side, they are soft materials, and nothing to break or choke on, but even though the box is a carrying case...don't be fooled you will never get everything back in that box ;-)	-1
My 2 year old loves to tinker and explore but, unfortunately, he did not find much interest in this item.	-1
While it is "Deluxe" it isn't that great. It is a lot of wasted space.. I wanted something large and while it is large it's all just empty plastic! We ended up taking this back and buying a wood one.  Cons: -The dish holder at top was awful, the plates wouldnt sit up in it. -The drawers were bad too.. not room to put stuff in the kids got frustrated and it was hard to open and close. They were constantly falling out!! -Spaces were small, even though the kitchen was big. Didn't really hold much but it was very bulky.  I would highly recommend you look around and see some kitchens in person before spending this much on the kitchen. I much like the wood one we bought better, and the kids love it!	-1
This came up when I searched for "crib bumpers". This is not a crib bumper. It is a toy.  As a toy, I'd give it 3 stars. The images are nice. The quality of the fabric is awful - it's a soft book that isn't soft! Maybe it would get better with washing, but I didn't try, we returned it because what we actually needed was a crib bumper.	-1
I ordered this because it contains the colors babies are first able to see.  I was disappointed with the quality.  The pictures look like a five year old drew them and are somewhat scary.  Great concept, poor quality.	-1
I love Melissa and Doug , but this toy looked old and used when I got it. I had it sent to my MIL house, so my child would have a new toy, but she didn't even play with it. We have a lot of their others toys, and we love them. However, the quality of this toy was poor. The colors are really dull and faded. It is not as pictured at all. In hindsight I should have returned the toy, but we left it out of town.	-1
This is a really cute toy BUT it didn't keep my 4yr old interested at all. She played with it for a hour and it's been at the bottom of her toy box since.  It was a good thought at the time but didn't keep my child interested; just for an hour after receiving it.  :(	-1
Quality was not as I expected :( The color was off and the crafting was bot as pictured. Very disappointed.	-1
Total waste.	-1
The paint on one of the buns was bubbled and chipping when it arrived and the wood on one of the tomatoes had split too.	-1
I got this also for my daughter's birthday and again CHEAPLY MADE! I expected so much more from the pricy Melissa & Doug sets!! I had so many more of them on my wishlist to get, and now there is no way! My daughter played with it one day, dropped the box on carpet and it fell apart, CHEAP!!	-1
After all the rave reviews, I was looking forward to getting the game.  It arrived today and we opened it immediately in hopes of finding it as fun as everyone says.  The game is made entirely out of wood and the top cover slides in/out of grooves in the main box.  We couldn't get the lid to slide off easily and when it was about halfway, it made a horrific screeching sound that pierced our ears.  Seriously, it was so loud I thought my ears might start bleeding!  Same thing happened when putting the lid back into place.  The lid also does not fit all the way back on due to misaligment without trying to lift the inside part up some.  Upon examining the game closer, it is obvious that the box and lid are not squared well, causing the fit to be slightly off.  This causes the lid to rub tightly against the inside, resulting in the loud screeching and difficulty in removing it.  The playing pieces also are made of wood, and the paint job on them left a lot to be desired.  Yes, the game is playable but for 30 bucks, I expect higher quality and something that doesn't look like a 5 year old painted it.  No, I don't expect perfection but I certainly do expect decent  quality.  Adding to these issues is a strong lacquer smell which is altogether unpleasant.  Perhaps it would have dissipated with time, but we didn't keep the game long enough to find out.  I'm sure the game is fun so I gave it 4 stars for that along with the educational value (for strategy), but the quality of the game we received was poor and unacceptable for the price.	-1
And a waste of money! My daughter got this as a gift at 6 months, and was not impressed by it at all, but did find my dogs reaction to the toy quite funny. This is a annoying repetive toy, one with little value as either a plaything or any educational value. I tossed it after it had collected dust for the last few months, my advice is, don't bother, get a set of the peek a blocks instead, your baby and you will have much more fun!	-1
This toy is not a backpack at all, it is simply a plastic box that talks and contains a few cheap plastic toys. My children were highly disappointed that they could not wear backpack like Dora does.  They will carry it by it's handle but get frustrated when the top opens while carrying.  The toys contained in the pack are cheaply made and unintersting. It is very hard to get the toys into or out of the small pack opening causing my children to get frustrated again.  The only positive to this toy is its talking feature.	-1
You would think that by calling this a backpack, you would be able to wear it on your back.  Nope.  It doesn't even have straps or anything.  You would have to carry it by the handle to tote it around, so my 2 year old calls it a purse.  The toys inside are all kind of boring-they don't really do anything.  My girls probably like the "telescope" the best because you can actually look through it-it's the one thing that DOES something.  The singing on the toy is cute, although it only says a few phrases.  Overall, kind of a lame toy.	-1
There is nothing good I can say about this toy. We bought it when our son was 6mths old and at 12mths he still would pick anything in the entire house before this!  Also it is dangerous!!! Our son was pushing it out of his way to get to another toy and it fell forward and he fell onto it. Well he was stuck in between the wheels on the back side. Thank goodness he is always with us and we caught it immediatly. Very scary, he could not move or get out of it.  It is now in the trash. Save your money and get the hungry hippo by fisher price.	-1
We bought this for our daughter when she was a year old.  This is not something I would recommend for a child who is still learning to walk- here's why:  a quick re-enactment... Daughter takes lid off toy, gets up to practice her walking skills, falls on the box part of toy and gets swollen lip.  The shapes should be just a tiny bit smaller, sometimes if they're at a slight angle it seems they don't want to fit, very frustrating for a small child who is actually trying to put the right shape in the right hole, but it won't fit.  We ended up buying a better made sorting toy for about $30 and have had no complaints.	-1
Good game	-1
Our daughter received this and the Animal Sounds Zoo for her first birthday. The zoo gets played with several times a day and this sits on the sidelines ignored.  My first complaint is that the ark comes apart into too many pieces. It is hard for a toddler to assemble it and certainly isn't portable at all. Secondly, the edges of the toy are actually quite sharp as I found out when I accidentally stepped on part of it and sliced my foot open.  My one year old broke part of the roof of the ark the second time she played with it, so it's not very durable, either. The plastic is thin and seems more brittle than other Little People sets.  The best part of the set are the Little People themselves. The animals are adorable and are very well made. She carries them around with her everywhere, but they wind up at the zoo, not at the ark. We have found the Animal Sounds Zoo to be a much better toy. Our daughter plays with it many times a day and dances to the bird sound. Maybe she will like the ark when she is older, but I don't know if it will survive that long.	-1
I purchased this swing for my 9 month old son. He loves to swing. However the swing straps on this swing seemed to annoy him. Due to the design of the straps he was able to free himself, and just hang over the safety bar. The design also seemed to push him down and caused him to slouch and lean in unconfortable ways, so he never wanted to stay in this swing very long. The rope was also very short, as the instructions indicate swing should be no more than 18" off the groud, and ours was easily 3'. Rope was also hard to adjust to swing straight, so he was always swinging a bit crooked. We returned it after only 3 days and purchased a roadster child swing at the Home Depot(also found on amazon)it looks like a little car, and baby just loves it, and I can tell he is comfortable and safe!	-1
Please read through reviews on the 2nd and 3rd pages - lots of people have complained about the slouch (too bad I noticed these reviews AFTER we purchased the swing:-(  We bought this swing, set it up,  threw out the box, and then realized a couple of days later that the slanted back with the straps forces kids' bodies downwards and they have no way of pushing themselves back up.  How irritating,  right?...especially since the box is gone!  Our son doesn't complain about anything "hurting,"  but then again, he doesn't seem to want to stay in it for very long (and he looooves swinging). It does seem to fit my 16 mo. old (about 30 lbs.) well.  In fact, it is just his size.  I know parents have had problems with some of these toddler swings being the size of infant swings - just something to watch for as you read reviews.  A couple of other things about this swing that are annoying: The rope is really, really short and we couldn't find one tree branch in the front or back low enough to use.  We ended up having to purchase extra rope and chain, just something else for you to consider.  Also,  it comes affixed with 2 unremovable hooks for hanging without instructions.  I am really disappointed with this swing over all,  especially since it is a more expensive model and we still had to spend more money after buying it!	-1
The swing came with the back ropes too long on one side, and the front ropes too long on one side (2 inches too long!). My son looks uncomfortable sliding into the side. The back one could be fixed by yanking the rope through to the shorter side. The front ropes are not connected, and so you can't adjust the lengths to fix it. Also I notice that the swing is pretty inclined, even in the 'not-inclined' position. I'm not sure if that's normal, or a 'feature' like my rope length differences.	-1
PARENTS BEWARE THE SAFETY HARNESS DETACHES BY ITSELF. Not safe for child to be in. Mine came very late and damaged with parts missing. However I looked at it make and it should be recalled back to the factory as a product unsafe for the child to use. The safety harness is essential in such chairs. Should NOT hang on two "x" crossed ends with nothing else holding it to the chair.	-1
The front ropes aren't adjustable, and one was longer than the other, so the swing hung crooked. I had to return it. It's possible just mine was defective.	-1
Defective and amazon wanted me to pay $20 more for an exchange for a different one. Not nice in my eyes	-1
When we got this thing the ropes were so uneven that it couldn't even be used.  It says there's a way to adjust the ropes, but it looked difficult and appeared to compromise the integrity of the swing.  The plastic seemed thin and cheap.  We decided to go with something a little sturdier.	-1
I bought this thinking I could attach it under our second story deck. But what the description doesn't tell you is that it's made for an existing swing set, which I don't have. So, total waste of money for me. If I was buying a whole swing set, I wouldn't need this!! Very unhappy with this purchase. And since I ripped the card board open to find the directions and installation hardware (which it doesn't come with, because you're supposed to already have that with your swing set), I can't return it.	-1
I received the swing in the mail, and was so excited....until I tried to hang it up.  Where the front and back ropes meet together with a metal clasp towards the top, they were connected unequally (the length at connection)...therefore the swing is lopsided, and doesn't even swing back and forth.  It just flops sides to side.  So disappointing.	-1
Watch out for it flipping upside down.  I have this swing and the Little Tikes one (both similar design), and whilst the Little Tikes one seems very stable in terms of keeping the kids upright, this Fisher Price one has tipped my kids upside-down on a few occasions.  When they are swung far back, if happen to lean forward just before they start coming back forward again, this is when it seems to lose balance and leave them suspended head down.  Thankfully the safety straps and the tray table HAVE remained in place to hold them in.  If you do buy this item, I would recommend you make sure it is mounted high enough so that they didn't hit their head if they end up swinging upside down and freaking out.  Supervise.  And follow Fisher Price's caution of having it above a soft surface (eg chipbark or something).	-1
I was so excited to get my one year old a swing, and this was just such a disappointment.  It's meant to hang from a tree branch or pre-existing swing set, which isn't mentioned anywhere in the description.  We were going to put eye-hooks in our porch roof, but it actually recommends against using the hooks (or even really the swing set for that matter), due to the potential for creating metal shavings.  Considering how many swing sets are metal on metal, it makes me think it must be some awfully cheap not very sturdy metal that they use.  Second, we tried roping it around a sturdy part of the trellis since we don't have any trees in the desert, and it hung about 5 feet off the ground.  Much too high for comfort.  Then, to make matters MORE annoying, it didn't matter what we did, it would not level out.  We tried adjusting the ropes behind the seat like the directions said, and they never budged.  Great I supposed for peace of mind once it's installed properly, but no amount of pushing, pulling, or maneuvering was going to get those things to move.  So, it's since been pulled back down, and will be returned as soon as the holidays are done.  What a horrible disappointment.  Also note, if you so much as glance at this, you'll realize that it is NOT a dual restraint system - the tray is just a tray, easily removable, and will NOT keep your child in the swing.	-1
Received the wrong size.	-1
Item was great.	-1
Super cute and big, but got a hole in it within days. Would be good if you have a pool - will take up a bit of space. Be careful because it could easily get a hole in it.	-1
It was very difficult to deflate this due to several different chambers (in the head and legs). It's a nice size float that several young kids could play on, but after struggling to deflate it a few times we decided it wasn't worth it and got rid of it.	-1
This was great for the first couple of uses.  However, the seam quickly split at the edge and it will no longer hold air.  It didn't tear or have a puncture, but rather the seam just came unsealed.	-1
doesn't hold air. Great size for bigger kids but doesn't stay inflated.	-1
After one use this turtle has a leak that I cannot find.  Very expensive for just one use!  Wouldn't recommend.	-1
If a product made for a child, which this one clearly is, is not sturdy enough to last more than one hour then it is nothing but a disappointment to the child and a waste of money to the person who purchased it. I had to promise to replace it to my daughter, but really I am hoping she just forgets about it.	-1
Just like the game nertz. I don't think I should've bought the board. Just a few decks of cards.	-1
The game itself is just 'ok'.  It's basically "Dutch Blitz", but with a board and regular playing cards.  The game board made it very hard to see the cards because it has pictures of cards all over it...so you have a tough time seeing where the REAL cards are.  We played it without the game board and it was much better.  But again, it's the same as Dutch Blitz, so if you already have that, it's repeat (except it does have 6 decks instead of just 4, like Dutch Blitz).	-1
I see alot of good reviews for this toy, but that just hasn't been the experience for us. Our daughter has always been a bit sensitive to noises. She's terrified of the vacuum, electric hand driers, and this toy makes a very similar noise. She was frightened of it at 12 months, and at 22 months nothing's changed... in fact just the sight of the toy sends her running to the other side of the room. Otherwise it looks like a fun toy, it's just maybe not for everyone.	-1
I bought this toy for my daughter when she was just learning to sit up as an incentive to learn to maintain a sitting position for a while.  The good: --my daughter loved it!  It was fun and kept her attention for 15 minutes or so (at a young age, that is quite a feat!)  The bad: --the balls really pop out of this thing and if have hard floors, they will go bouncing and rolling around.  Plan on spending a lot of time chasing after them if you child can't/won't get them herself. --there is no good way to dislodge things that get stuck in this toy.  Like most kids, my daughter thought it would be *super* to see what else would fit down the hole and I spend a good amount of time trying to dislodge a cotton ball from the inner workings. --this is not the quietest toy in the world.  While the toy isn't designed to make "fun" noises, the fan motor is fairly loud. --the fan motor gave out after a few months.	-1
I got this toy for my son for Christmas last year when he was 7 months old.  He was afraid of it because of the noise (it sounds like a very loud vacuum cleaner).  I was also not impressed with the narrowness of it - very easy for an eager infant to knock it over.  I put it away in the closet and got it out again at 10 and 12 months.  Both times, he was frightened of the noise and I had to put it away again.  When the balls do "pop" they don't fall nicely in the tray that is provided, they hit it and bounce out and go all over the place.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I think the concept of this toy is a good one, but unfortunately, it was way too noisy and just freaked out my toddler.  This is the type of toy that I think she would really have enjoyed (for the cause-and-effect aspect), but she was too terrified to even approach it.	-1
The balls go flying out of the machine all over the floor.  Usually, they do NOT return into the machine and pop back out.  It was not fun chasing the balls everywhere. The motor is SO loud that you can barely hear the music!  It scares my 8 month old but my 8 year old neice loves it!  Glad it was on clearance at Wally World.	-1
So far, I don't get the positive reviews. The toy sounds like a hair dryer with calliope music superimposed. It's pretty irritating to me; I can't imagine that a 9-mo-old  would like the noise. It happens that my 25-month-old has never liked the sound or the blowing of hairdryers--that's the one part of his first haircut that made him cry--and he won't play with the toy as designed. He loves the light plastic balls and has created several games for them, and he has had fun dismantling the body of the toy, but he won't let me turn on the switch. I don't think of him as overly timid. He is very fun-loving and loves his music toys, but so far this toy hasn't worked for him. Maybe he'll get used to it. My husband, on the other hand, thinks the toy is a riot.	-1
I got this for my 2 year old.  Both he and his 4 year old brother found it entertaining.  It is also good practice for little ones to place an object into a small hole (fine motor skills).  Problems with it though:  my 2 year old, who still chews on things. promptly destroyed all the balls. This toy is intended for babies and babies mouth their toys, so I think the balls should have been able to handle it.  This toy is also loud without volume control.  Heads up--takes 4 D batteries that aren't included.	-1
My 11 month old daughter got this toy as a Christmas present and she HATES it. She is normally not scared of loud noises or anything else for that matter, but she is terrified of this toy. She cries whenever I turn it on, so for now it's sitting in the closet until she gets older. Maybe she will like it better then. It's TOO LOUD and the balls fly everywhere but back into the toy.	-1
I see alot of good reviews on this product so maybe this just happened to my son. The toy is very fun for him to watch, and grab balls however my son has a knack for testing things it seems. I was in the kitchen while he had this toy, and I noticed when I came out he had stuck his whole arm down the tunnel trying to grab a ball, and got it stuck. He is almost two, and boys are more likely to be rough with the toys. Anyway long story short I had to use baby oil to get his arm out. I will be contacting the company before I throw the toy out. Other than that the blue slide was constantly being taken off by my son. I rated five stars for fun because he had more attention on this than anything else for awhile.	-1
I have passed by this toy countless times in the isles of Wal-mart, but never felt the need to purchase it. Well, my 10 month old son received it for Christmas and it's fast become my least favorite toy. There is no volume control, which is a huge bummer since this plays extremely loud music, and the fan that pushes the balls up sounds like a blow dryer. Very loud.  The worst thing though is the balls pop up so hard and fast that they fly all over the place. My son seems to enjoy the balls popping up and cycling through the toy, but I have to sit there with it and keep my hand over the top to prevent the balls from flying all over, otherwise, they go everywhere and he just loses interest. We have light carpeting and they still manage to roll under furniture or across the room.  In the end, I'd say avoid this. It's definitely not worth the trouble. Way too noisy and too much work. I think I'm gonna put it away till he's a bit older, and can chase after the balls himself. I'm just thankful I listened to my gut and didn't spend my own money on this colossal pain-in-the-rear!	-1
We bought this toy second hand and I hate it! The balls constantly pop out in the floor, my daughter totally ignores it, and it's entertainment factor is zilch. I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this item as I would have returned it immediatly.	-1
Okay, so I just had to add my two cents in here in case anyone else out there has an active dog in the house like I do.  Someone gave me this toy for my five month old and he seems quite entertained by it, except for the fact that the balls shoot out EVERYWHERE and this, in turn, makes our Jack Russell Terrier go absolutely nuts.  The baby cannot play with the toy without the dog jumping all over the place to grab the balls.  Yes, we do remove the dog from the room if the baby is playing with the toy.  But right now the baby is too little to chase after the balls himself, so eventually he winds up with nothing to play with in the toy itself (you need to keep feeding the balls back into the machine to get them to spin around and shoot out again).  It is recommended for older babies for this reason!  Anyway, if you have a  family pet who is playful and likes to be involved in everything like our does, you might want to think twice about this one.  I was just hoping I could spare someone else who might have the same problem.  If you don't have a dog and you don't mind your baby crawling after the balls or eventually cleaning them up yourself, then go for it!  The music is cute, the product is colorful, and the whooshing sounds that the balls make as they pop in and out are really fun.  I'm not sure how much educational value it has, other than maybe helping some fine motor skills if the baby can catch the balls and dump them back into the machine.  But I guess it could be entertaining.	-1
I wish I would have read more reviews on this... I bought it for my one year old's birthday. WAY too loud, obnoxious is more like it.  Both of my kids like the activity but walk away before they're done being entertained because it's too loud.  Plus it takes 4 D batteries, $$$. Getting rid of it and sticking to my wooden toy purchases.	-1
Well...I almost don't know what to say.  This toy gets pretty solid reviews, which I rely on when I am purchasing.  I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old.  This was purchased for the one year old for his birthday, with the thought, as we do with many purchases, that both would enjoy it on some level.  The first one did not work at all, fan was broken.  Second one works ok, but many times the fan is not strong enough and the balls get stalled blowing only at the height of the opening they are supposed to come out of.  But, often it works well enough that if that were the only issue, it would be a worthwhile toy.  Now, that being said, I personally find the toy extremely annoying even when it is working right, because the balls do NOT stay in the toy even remotely on a regular basis, they fly out consistently and have to be out back in.  Since the toy is not for me, and the kids giggle and put them back in, even that is ok, even though the balls spend a lot of time being lost.  My major issue is that my 2 boys, absolutely refuse to quit putting things that do not belong in the toy down the holes the balls are supposed to go in.  Though I did not read all 500 reviews, I cannot believe that I am the only parent that has had this issue.  We have a bent clothes hanger that we keep on-hand just for unclogging this toy.  I also consider my boys to be fairly normal, and they play with other toys just fine, they way they are supposed to be played with.  As a result, this toy spends a lot of time being out of commission.  Although we spend a lot of time playing with our boys and their toys, we also encourage a lot of independent playtime.  When we do play together, we color or use Play Doh or play a game with rules and pieces that have to be monitored, and this toy was purchased with the thought that they would play with it on their own.  The only way it functions as intended (without lost balls and clogged ducts) is if we supervise.  Therefore, it does not fulfill it's purpose in our home and I would not purchase it again.  I would recommend knowing what your goals are for this toy before you decide to buy it.	-1
My nearly 2 year old twins love this toy but I hate it.  The balls end up everywhere and they try to shove all of their small toys and their arms (up to their shoulders) down the chute.  We have had numerous toys stuck in the popper and they are practically impossible to get out.  The balls fly everywhere and the popper doesn't work as well unless all of the balls are in it. On the plus side, this toy plays fun songs and seems to be durable.	-1
This toy is something that we bought after my children (who were 4, 2, and under 1 at the time) played with it at a friends house. At first, it was tons of fun to watch them chasing around the balls.  It became a nightmare when my children began to stick other toys down into it.  Then my middle daughter actually got her arm stuck in the opening.  I had to take the entire thing apart to get her arm unstuck.  I also had to take it apart everytime another toy found its home in the toy.  (No, holding it upside down and banging did not work - these toys were stuck). I will never again have this toy in my home and if it is somewhere that we visit my children are not allowed to play with it.	-1
I thought this looked like so much fun, but I'm really disappointed.  When the balls pop out they either come back down on the edge of where they came out and fly across the room or, as they come down, another ball is coming out and they hit each other and both fly across the room.  Within five seconds, every ball is out of the ball popper and the baby is left there waiting for something to happen.  When he realized the show is over, he crawls off unamused.	-1
This thing honestly gives me an anxiety attack every time it's on! Between the spastic music and the balls flying everywhere, it gets quite intimidating. My son likes it for about 2 minutes and also gets irritated with all the balls flying uncontrollably everywhere. When I purchased this, I thought the balls were a little more controlled, maybe just popped up in the air a little and back down into the funnel thing, but NO! They go EVERYWHERE! All over the room! You spend more time chasing than you do watching. We finally put him and the toy in one big box, just to control the balls, and he liked that better. Ugh, I wish I wouldn't have bought it...	-1
This is a completely pointless toy. After reading the reviews, I purchased it thinking it would be fun. My husband and I sat there along with our 8 month old son in shock that someone actually presented this idea and it was manufactured. The sound is like a hair dryer on the low setting and they try to "mask" this with music that you can barely hear. Next, the balls start to pop up and they re-enter the "machine" leaving my son nothing to do...UNTIL, they started not making back into the machine and they popped all over our living room which made him burst into tears.  I thought, maybe this is just our son. When I had friends over for the SuperBowl, I busted out the ball popper. From 5 months to 15 months, there was a stare down at this machine. We communitively decided that it takes 8 adults and 5 children to play with this toy. 4 adults to chase after the ball and 4 to calm the children. While this is obviously just poking fun at the ridiculousness of this toy, I use it to illustrate that this is a completely waste of your money and we are sending ours back. I couldn't even convince one of the families to take it home with them...for free.  Overall, I am shocked that there were so many positive review and if you want a toy that your child with engage in with their pals, invest in something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rollipop-Starter-Set/dp/B000H6FEWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rollipop Starter Set</a>&nbsp;All of the kids played together with this toy for well over half an hour.	-1
I did not want this toy after reading the reviews, but my sister-in-law bought if for my son.  Each of the 1-star reviews here have addressed one problem or another, but let me just sum it all up into one complete version of the MANY PROBLEMS.  1. Upon assembly my son IMMEDIATELY stuck his arm in the hole.  One reviewer said that the toy has been redesigned with a cover of some sort.  I looked around and have not found this.  Our popper was purchased in December 2007 from Target, so I would assume it's from one of the newest manufacturing lots.  Target doesn't keep toys on their shelves for very long.  It's still dangerous, no fixes made that I can see.  2. LOUD, LOUD, LOUD. Both the fan and the music.  3. The fan is not strong enough to push the balls out when there is more than 1 ball in the chamber. 4. When you put just 1 ball in the chamber so there is less weight, the fan is then too strong and the ball pops over the toy and rolls away.  The product description says "Sometimes the balls spill over for even more interactive, put-and-take play."  What an absurd statement!  I can't think of anything I'd less like to do than retrieve balls from beneath the couch, coffee table and TV stand.  5. The toy is quite heavy.  When all 4 balls are in the chamber we have to tip the toy over to get them out (because of the weak fan).  My 16-month old has seen me do that and quickly learned to do it himself, but he's not strong enough to tip it without the toy falling on his foot.  Further, he usually does the tipping routine after he's turned it on, and once the toy is tipped on its side the balls then shoot out like a rocket launcher.  My son has taken a few in the face.  I HATE THIS TOY.  It should be recalled, retired, redesigned... whichever... just get rid of it, Hasbro!	-1
First of all, if you loose the balls you can't buy replacement balls. If the cheap plastic balls get smashed they won't go through the tunnel any more. The thing keeps falling apart! The top always comes off. And my biggest gripe, this thing suck batteries!!! You may as well take them to Chucky Cheese for all the money you will spend on batteries. Get the Fisher Price Giraffe ball toy instead, way better!	-1
The concept behind this toy is great, but the engineering/design is not.  Looking at the picture here, I believe they may have redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago as the chute attaches differently as pictured.  Perhaps this works better because the chute is constantly coming apart on ours.  We've also had the problem of the balls getting stuck or just kind of swaying back and forth.  The music is HORRIBLY loud.  We have to turn it off if we're trying to watch TV and son is playing in the room.  Many musical toys have at least a low and high volume switch.  This one desperately needs one!!  On the positive, our son does love to watch the balls and grab at them as they pop out or go down the chute.  He will chase the balls when they go flying.  He's not quite old enough to know how to put them back in the toy once they are out, but he'll get there.  He'd probably play with it a lot more had I more tolerance for the music!	-1
This game would have been more fun if there were about 100 more butterflies.  The butterflies come out for about 5 seconds and then you have to reload.  The batteries have to be brand new to generate enough power to blow out the butterflies too.  I returned mine and got "Pop Up Pirates" which is more fun.	-1
Elefun is a simple game that requires no special setup and no special strategy. It is a somewhat physical game involving the catching of butterflies in a small net. These vinyl butterflies are placed in the base, the trunk is attached, the motor is turned on, and the butterflies slowly release from Elefun. The person who catches the most is the winner. It is a game that can be learned instantly and can be used to provide some quick entertainment when children are getting restless.  Elefun offers some good points that make it a hit with most children; namely the action factor, which encourages children to physically compete as they scramble with their nets in hand, trying to catch as many butterflies as possible to win the game. But other than this, Elefun isn't as much fun as its name suggests. First, the action factor is actually a little on the slow side. I can agree that a gradual release of the butterflies from Elefun's trunk is a good idea, but the problem is the amount of time it takes for the trunk to expand and the slowness of the release of the vinyl butterflies. The motor is too weak to get the game going and some children will grow impatient having to wait.  Another problem with Elefun is its tendency to eat up batteries. The game takes four batteries and they die quickly, mainly because the game is very brief and most children will want to play it again and again. If this happens, the batteries are not likely to last more than a few days. It is a little puzzling that four batteries would produce so little power and also die out so quickly, but this is exactly what happens. Then, there is the problem with the butterflies themselves. There are thirty of them, but no matter how they are placed in the base, Elefun doesn't release them all. There are always a few butterflies left, stuck in the base. Their small size makes them easy to lose, too.  Kids like action- oriented games and most children will like Elefun at first. But once they are forced to stand around, waiting for the butterflies to release and once they realize how quickly the batteries fail, they will grow frustrated with this game and push it aside in favor of more reliable entertainment. It could be improved with a few simple changes, but until that happens, don't waste your time or money on Elefun.	-1
I must admit, my daughter really likes this toy ... when it's working correctly!  Most of the time, the balls just fly out of the toy, never to be seen again until I go searching under furniture for them.  I do feel as if I'm "fetching" these balls for my daughter over and over again.  If I don't, she gets frustrated because the toy doesn't do anything!  I love Playskool toys, but I really feel like they missed the mark with this one!	-1
This is the kind of toy I'd wish I'd gotten a smoking deal on.  It's not the worst game we have in the closet, but it wasn't worth the $25 we paid for it.  For starters, the butterflies do not fly very well once outside of the elephants trunk.  The fan doesn't blow very well, so there isn't much extra help to get those butterflies going, either.  The butterflies just come out of the trunk and drop.  So the kids just stand there - not like on the tv commercial...  Also, depending on the age of your children, they're either going to be too good or not ready for the game.  I have 4 kids plus their friends.  And we've found that there isn't a lot of middle ground.  Either they're great at this, or they have a lot to learn about catching butterflies...  So having the good kids and the bad kids play together causes problems.  Beware of this.  Anyway - if you read this review before buying, only buy this game if it's a super good deal (or your child is dying to have it)  It's not worth the full price.	-1
we recieved this as a gift, and I just got rid of it.  I would not buy it for myself or anyone else.  It looks so fun, but is disapointing.  We tried two different sets of brand new battries, then realized it was just a weak toy.  I had to stand up the elephant trunk with my hands (while it was running) then all of the butterflies come out at once, then if there are any stragglers in the elephant trunk it doesn't have enough blowing power to shoot them out, they just spin around inside.  So the kids really have only one shot to catch any butterflies.  My kids really like to play with it, but it is frustaring when I have to turn it off, take the trunk off, and re-load the butterflies every five seconds.	-1
The first time you run this game, it's a big hit. It takes a minute or less (usually closer to 45 seconds) for all of the butterflies to come out of the trunk. I've tried all kinds of methods to make this last longer but nothing works.  Then you need to gather up the butterflies that weren't caught and get them out of the nets, reload the game & start again. It takes a while to get the game set up again and by that point, since the fun is so short-lived, I've found that the kids don't want to play it anymore.  This game could be improved by having some kind of stop-start option that would allow the butterflies to come out in a more staggered manner if you wanted. I would also like to be able to purchase refill butterflies, since they have a tendency to stick to other things and get lost. I guess I'll try to make something instead, as we have few butterflies left.  Three of the nets have broken. The kids have used them as hats and as toys outside the realm of the Elephun game. the fabric of the nets is fine but the hoops have broken at the point where they would hook together. The kids have as much fun catching the butterflies with their hands (and it seems to be easier than using the nets).  The elephant itself is very durable and my kids had more fun using it to store other things, like sticking cards, checkers and small plush toys down the trunk. They were disappointed when the elephant didn't blast these out ;)	-1
I am rarely disappointed by toys and games, but this one takes the cake.  The fan barely has enough umph to get the little "thingies" out of the trunk, and by the time they come out, you have to load them up again.  Only a few come out, and it becomes very disappointing for the kids.  Mine is in the garbage.	-1
Even brand new batteries won't make this toy operate as advertised.  The motor is too weak to make the butterflies exit the toy.  My 3 year old son was terribly disappointed and grew bored waiting for butterflies to pop out.  Don't waste your money on this toy.	-1
I could not have been more discouraged with this toy and would return it if I could.  The blowing air was the only thing my 12 months old baby liked.  The ball get stuck at the botton and won't always pop up which discouraged my daugher.  She would stick her arm down the hole and then fall over. I was afraid she was going to break or injure her arm so I put the toy up until she was older.  She is now 21 months old and still has no interest in the toy.  She has taken the top shoots off of it and only plays with the balls.  Hopefully I will get a good price for it at the garage sale this summer.	-1
I thought this toy would make a cute gift from Santa so I added it to the pile.  My 2 & 3 year old loved the whole concept but the toy is poorly constructed and constantly falling apart.  I finally made it "disappear" and left them with the ball to play with.  This toy needs to be revamped and made as one piece or better construction.  Great idea but someone fell asleep during the tryout phase on this one.	-1
Don't waste your money!!  The net and other pieces never stay on -the toy is very small and not approp. for an older child.  Mine were 2 and 4 when I bought it.  They used it a few times and we were so tired of putting it back together we gave it away!  They never really enjoyed it when it was working - don't buy!!	-1
My son requested this for Christmas of 2003. We purchased it from amazon and put it away for christmas since christmas was still a few months away. Christmas morning I couldn't belive when we took it out of the box and pieces were missing. We didn't even get the right feet. Literally! Our game came with two left feet not a right foot. There wasn't enough pieces to get him put together correctly so we figured we would put batteries in it just to see what the game sounded like. Surprise the game didn't even turn on. What a piece of junk. My son really wanted another one, but we explained the value (...) and that he would be better off trying a different toy.	-1
I bought this toy for my daughter who stated it was the only thing she wanted for her birthday.  It was fun the two times that we played, but on the third time, the motor wouldn't start.  I payed almost 20.00 for the game and 7.00 for new batteries for it.  It was definately the shortest amount of fun I have ever paid 27.00 for, and my daughter was sorely disappointed.  This toy is junk.	-1
I bought this for my 2.5 yr old for Easter. IT would not work the first few times. We had to open it up and fluff all the wings. Then a few come out but not even half. My son kept sreaming for them to come out. After 30 minutes of trying to get it to work he was in tears and I felt terrible. It is such a great idea for a game with little rules for young kids. It just needs a stronger blower. I am taking tis one back!!!	-1
I bought this toy for my three year old and for my three daycare children.  We played it the first day and it worked great and they absolutely loved it.  However, and this is the bad thing, unless you are willing to put out the money for new batteries each and every time you use it, then don't buy it.  The batteries seem wear down after just a half hour of use.  I would recomend rechargeable batteries for this toy.  I was very disapointed.	-1
My son received this as a gift.  First, we had to help our child get the trunk to stand up so the things would blow out.  Second, it worked a few times and then seemed to lose it's "umph".  So, I changed the batteries.  That didn't help, though.  Pretty soon the fan stopped working enough to blow the pieces out of the trunk.  My child was so disappointed I had to start "manually" throwing the pieces in the air so he could catch them with the net.  This toy quickly was "out of sight-out of mind" and into the trash.	-1
My one year old boy sat through an entire dinner party playing with this game--it must have been two solid hours of concentration!  I am bringing this toy everywhere I need a moment's peace!	-1
I was so excited to buy this for my three year old daughter. I figured it would reinforce counting and colors as well as eye hand coordination. When we started playing, the butterflies took forever to shoot out. I opened it and mixed them around as the instructions stated but still only one or two popped out. The rest kept blowing around on the bottom. Very disappointing. After a while my daughter said "all done Mommy". She was bored standing there waiting for the butterflies. I don't blame her, I was bored myself. The fan worked fine and the trunk fully extended & I put fresh batteries so Im not really sure what went wrong. Its such a nice idea but Im sad to say its a lemon of a game.	-1
Do NOT buy this game! My daughter received one and another member of my family received one and it is the worst toy received since my daughter's birth 4 years ago. The fan is not even powerful enough to inflate the trunk let alone blow anything out of it! This is with new batteries too. You have to open up the trunk and wait for one butterfly to come out then wait two more minutes for another. The picture on the box is very deceiving.	-1
Didn't last the summer	-1
Just another cheap Chinese junker.	-1
Less than one week's use and there is pink mold all inside the white holes (which will NOT wash out).  I have owned many plastic floats and this is the first time this has happened with one.  Disgusting.	-1
This is the worst gate I have ever seen!  We bought it 2 weeks ago to help our dog learn that the baby's room was off limits.  Well, I lifted the lever to release the gate today and it broke!  The notch that we set it at broke out and shot across the room.  Plus it was hard to use from the beginning!  The directions are vague at best and the arm that locks it was almost impossible for me to get locked into place.  It kept shifting the gate off center or bowing to where it wouldn't lock.  My husband had to set it up most of the time.  Once it was up, it was flimsy at best.  It would fall under the smallest amount of pressure...like the pressure exerted when a child pulls up on something.  I know it is one of the cheaper gates marketed, but come on!  There is no way that I would depend on this thing when it can to the saftey of my child!	-1
This is the old standard in inexpensive gates.  However, they don't make these the same way they used to.  The expansion rod had been bolted directly against the frame on both halves of the gate.  Now, however, there is an extension where it is bolted to the recessed half so that the expansion rod lines up straight along the length of the gate.  While it appears that this would improve the function of the gate, my own experience is that it makes the gate more flimsy and more difficult to line up in the doorway.  The older design works much better and I feel that the newer design decreases the safety function expected of the this gate.  Also, any gate with a crosshatch design like this one is climbable.  To its benefit, this gate does not swing open and is more difficult for kids to remove than gates that do - most kids are pretty good at figuring out the mechanism on gates that open.  NEVER USE A PRESSURE MOUNTED GATE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS.  A stairway gate should be very sturdy and should require installation.	-1
It does spill. Wands are hard to remove from bucket. Not worth the price.	-1
The photo shows it as RED & GREEN but I received a pink & purple bucket! Since this gift was for a little boy, I wasn't thrilled. I also didn't realize that it doesn't come with bubbles (that's my fault, not the seller).	-1
EXPENSIVE FOR A BUCKET.	-1
I found this "No Spill" bubble bucket to be rather disappointing.  It comes with three wands, which is great when you have two or more kids playing with bubbles at the same time but the wands didn't do a particularly impressive job at making nice bubbles.  The bucket itself is an odd design with a small base, which makes it seem more likely to tip over, especially when placed on the grass.  After my 3 1/2 year old and my 16 month old tried it out it became that "No Spill" doesn't mean no mess.  When the kids put the wands back into their slots you wind up with a drippy mess all over the outside of the bucket.  So the awkward bucket design, the wands that don't make good bubbles and the mess from taking the wands in and out lead me to the conclusion that just giving the kids a small bottle of bubbles and their own wands is less of a mess than this bucket.  I wouldn't recommend this bucket.  It's better to just give your child a small bottle of bubbles that's filled 1/3 of the way up than to deal with this thing.	-1
It spills like crazy and the kids don't play with it.  I followed instructions and all my bubbles are gone. It left a mess everywhere too.	-1
Skip buying this bubble bucket. The wands are way too big, soap gets everywhere, and it really just makes a huge mess. Maybe it won't spill but what about the soap on the wands getting all over the floor. I have already thrown it away.	-1
I agree with a lot of the other reviews... this toy is a great idea, and I was so excited to get it as a gift and we did have fun with it (my daughter is 19 months old) so she gets the concept of blowing bubbles, but the wands are not great (or I did  not have good solution)... either way, it was hard for even me to get a good blow of bubbles. I also don't like that there is no lid to the top for storage, and the bubble solution that drips on the outside of the bucket make everything stick to it so dirt got all over the outside, and my daughter poured water into the top making the bubble solution too weak... so when I tried to unscrew the lid to clean and add fresh bubble solution, it was completely sealed stuck! I ran it under hot water, my husband had the wrenches out (and he's strong, and an engineer)... and nothing worked to get the lid off... so now what? The no-spill bucket is a great idea, but unless we can get this lid off, there is no way to clean it and add more bubbles for continued use. Bummed...	-1
I don't think it's meant to brake open. After the kids pulled all the strings it was still together perfectly with no give to break open.	-1
looked great! held a decent amount of candy...BUT. It is cardboard completely taped up with packing tape, making it impossible to hit open. My body builder husband had to rip it apart hulk style, which wasn't easy if that gives you an idea of how indestructible it was. I bought it for my 3 year olds birthday so didn't expect them to be able to dent it, but after the adults took a few swings and nothing happened we knew something was wrong haha. so if you want decoration, get it! It's very cute. But don't expect to actually use it as a pinata.	-1
fall of the wall.	-1
This product has an important amount of very tine stars. I will glue these to the roof, because only with the stickers, it could be an absolute choking hazard to our toddler. I would have liked that description of this item showed that there were a bunch of  tiny stars.	-1
I bought this for my 3yo who loves puzzles. Sadly this is one of the worst set of puzzles we own. The pieces don't connect very well together. As you can see from the pictures, the lines don't even align when connected. Some pieces don't even connect properly and that section ends up being not flat. It's very frustrating for a 3yo to try to force the pieces together when clearly they look like they match but somehow they don't connect. It takes the fun out of fixing the puzzle. He only fixed it once and didn't bother with it anymore, when normally he would do it over and over again. We have another Melissa and Doug underwater floor puzzle and that is so much better. I would not recommend this product and I'm considering returning it.	-1
Not awesome. The handle never fit on properly. And the wheels don't turn right. We would return it if we had a box big enough.	-1
Quality is poor, it's doesn't roll very well	-1
Absolute junk.  The issue is not with anything other than the front wheels/axles.  The plastic is durable enough on the container, the back wheels are solid enough (although both front and back are mounted into a plastic hole, so you can pretty much figure that's not going to last).  The front wheels "turn" without the benefit of being connected to each other via an axle, like the rear.  Plus the handle does not "steer" the wagon, so this wagon's ability to take corners and turn in general is entirely dependent on EACH front wheel swiveling correctly.  Well, any bit of a distortion in the relatively thin material used for the front wheel posts will mis-align this wagon to the point that one--or both--of the front wheels will literally take a 180 from rolling forward, and essentially you will be pulling someone with that wheel(s) sideways.  Good workout though, and I am sure something Rocky Balboa could have used to his advantage in prepping for a fight, but for me and probably you, it's a better purchasing decision to get a wagon with a real front axle.	-1
Horrible wagon! I've had it for just over a year and I'm looking for a new wagon. This time I'm going with Step 2. The front wheels decide to turn at random times making my 3 1/2 yr old son still say he cannot pull it EMPTY! He can pick up his 22 lb sister but cannot pull a toddler wagon!!! The wheels are so retarded that it makes the wagon a safety hazard - flips over very easy! Horrible, Horrible wagon. I will never buy a radio wagon. Fortunately this was a gift so at least I'm not wasting my money buying another wagon. I don't understand how radio wagons have been around for so long if they operate like this one! Too bad there's no guarantee for this wagon.	-1
Garbage. Would give it zero stars if I could. After less than an hour of use, the straps came off. It is now useless because my 10 month old will crawl out of it as we ride. I tried several times to reinstall the straps, but they keep coming off. I will have to go to the hardware store and get some hooks, bolts and washers to fix it, which I know I can do, but I'm not sure I want to put in that much effort to fix what the company should have taken care of to begin with.....shameful.	-1
Everything on this wagon is plastic, which makes for a horrible experience.  The independent front tires do not turn well at all, not even close.  You can't sit your child in the back, or else pulling on the handle lifts the front wheels off the ground.  Speaking of, that it how you have to turn this thing.  I would have sent it back if it were not a gift.  Go get a real wagon.  One with air inflated tires, real steering, and wood.	-1
My 2 yr old daughter received this wagon with much delight about 2 years ago. We all looked forward to using it on our evening walks around our neighborhood. Unfortunately, the front wheels are independent of one another, meaning that it's very difficult to steer - even when going straight on a sidewalk!  This afternoon I tried to take a walk with my 4yr old and her 14mo old sister. Much to my disappointment, the seat belts had completely dissolved into a blue mess! Granted, the wagon is stored outdoors, but so it our baby swing and it's seat belt is as strong as the day we hung it on the swing set.  After trying to pull this wagon about 500ft, we turned around and headed for home - the steering was unbelievably frustrating - with only 55lb to pull.  I'm going to ask Santa for a new wagon for my kids this year - one with an actual axle in the front so the wheels won't go in two different direction! I WOULD NOT recommend this product - spend a little extra money and get something with *real* wheels!	-1
Like the rest of the reviewers, I found that no matter how carefully you put the pieces on, they easily slip off. The most you can get on is about 2. The manufacturers of this game undoubtedly were aware of it. Its a shame they chose to market it anyway. Well, thank goodness you can review toys online. I hope I saved some other buyer from wasting his or her money on this defective game!	-1
What a bummer! We returned this game because, like so many other reviewers, even the adults couldn't get the pizza parts to stay on top. Topple isn't as cute to look at, but it's a reliable substitute.	-1
Way way WAY too hard. The pieces slide right off the surface. If the top had just a little friction, it would be fun. Instead, we usually get about 2 plays in before the topple. As a parent, I have to try really hard (and this is with the steady base) to get a piece on without it shifting and toppling - this is with it sitting steady on a hardwood floor with just me and my son.  I agree with others that the quality of the game pieces is really good. Surprisingly good, actually, considering the poor execution on the pizza itself.  Great concept, could have been a fun game, but poor execution and unenjoyable gameplay.  If you want frustrated kids and parents, this is the toy to get :)	-1
Does not work!	-1
It is a cute toy and our baby likes the ball and the bowling pins, but he likes them as separate toys. As a bowling game toy it does not work very well.	-1
This is a sloppy toy.  Not a lot of fun, hard to set up, and they don't stay up too well.  I cant think of a reason to buy this thing.	-1
I bought this toy for my son when he was about 14 months. He never touched and those bowling pins doesnt stand well.. no matter how hard i tried to make them stand .. they fell. Also, packing cover was ripped open with in a month after i bought the toy. there are better product in the market for less price.	-1
My two year old does not have any interest in this toy yet.  She will shake the cows sometimes as they rattle and toss them down the stairs, but that is the most she will do with it.  She did get a lot of other toys, so over time her interest may increase, but so far, this is not something that appeals to her.  We may have to take her bowling one day to see the whole purpose of it.	-1
The ball does not roll, so the toy cannot be used as suggested. Simple as that!	-1
My children really enjoyed this toy but I really didn't think it was all that great. The only thing they enjoyed about it was the ball. They threw it around a lot.  I couldn't get the animals to stand up right, EVER. It is not educational besides the pins are animals. Since the pins don't stand up though the kids don't really pay attention to them.  I ended up giving this toy away to someone who had a baby. I thought maybe it would be better for a baby who is learning how to hold things since the game part just doesn't work.	-1
After reading such favorable reviews I bought this bowling set for my son's first birthday.  We've had the toy now for a month and he is not very interested in it.  If I set it up for him he will toss the ball at the pins a couple of times and then look at a couple of animal/pins and then he is done.  I don't much care if he bowls with it, but he doesn't pick it up or ask for any of the pieces either.  While the toy is cute, something not played with is money wasted.  The toy seems well made and probably durable but without a child to love it, I just can't recommend it.	-1
This toy must be one of those 'hit or miss' type things.  My sons were not impressed at all - got on once or twice, and then left the poor blue puppy abadoned in the corner until I sold it on Craigslist.  LOL.	-1
I am very upset that I ordered this game from this company only to receive a beat up box with everything missing except the cards and the game board! If I could give the seller less stars I would!	-1
good quality but to small for several of my m&d puzzles	-1
This rack did not fit a single puzzle we owned, even though they were almost all Melissa and Doug. Returned it.	-1
Only 50% of my wooden M&D puzzles fit in this!	-1
I was excited to finally be able to put the puzzles in a rack and I opened the box and put 1 puzzle in and the other puzzles are to thick to fit in the rack so I still have puzzles all over but I had to take all the wrapping off of it to use it so now I guess I'm stuck with it.  I love all the other Melissa & Doug items that I own (which are many) but this just doesn't hold the puzzles well.	-1
Did not like it.	-1
VERY disappointed in this product! The only puzzles I have are Melissa and Doug. I have 5 of them and only 1 actually fits! I figured the sound puzzles wouldn't because they are thicker anyway but my two Disney puzzles from Melissa and Doug are to long to fit! You would think products from the same company would work together! What a waste of money!!	-1
It serves the purpose, but ONLY for the regular sized puzzles. So the four thicker Melissa & Doug puzzles (that make noise, etc) do not fit. So this purchase was pointless for half of my son's puzzles because we have to stack them on top or lay them along side - so they still look messt	-1
Puzzles doesn't fit very well.i am going to return it	-1
I was given this as a gift.  This puzzle rack was worthless to us so we use it as a shelf in the kitchen cabinet.  Only 25% of Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles actually fit into the puzzle rack.  This is because the wire edges that make the shelves angle inwards the deeper into the rack you slide the puzzle.  So, if any puzzle pieces are on the edge, then the puzzle pieces get hung up on the wire and cannot be slid in all the way. We also tried the puzzle rack with 2 other brands of chunky puzzles with the same width as the Melissa and Doug brand, and none of those fit because of the pieces being stuck on the inward angled wires.  The only way to use this rack was to strip all the puzzles of their pieces first which is a waste of space since those pieces now have to be stored somewhere else.  I will have to look for another solution.... which unfortunately is going to cost a lot more.	-1
Melissa and Doug Puzzles DOESNT FIT!!! Ridiculous. I will return	-1
Wasn't really impressed with this holder. I have too many bigger puzzles from Melissa and Doug that it won't fit. Returning it to by the bigger rack from Melissa and Doug and hopefully that will work.	-1
Does not fit the Melissa and Doug sound puzzles;( returned	-1
Barely fits Meliss and Doug puzzles.	-1
Rack is too small, seems flimsy	-1
Very poor design and does not fit the Melissa & Doug chunky puzzles or puzzles that are smaller than the 9x12.  Would not recommend it.  I had one that accommodated several sizes and heights of puzzles but could not find it, so got this one.  I don't recommend it.	-1
We have 7 Melissa and Douglas puzzles, and not all fit in this rack, only certain ones! We have to remove some of the pieces along the side of the pizzle in order for the chunky puzzles to fit. Very frustrating. Have not tried with the peg puzzles, just the chunky ones.	-1
Our Melissa and Doug puzzles are too big to fit on the rack.	-1
This puzzle storage case is great in theory.  One would think that since this storage case is made by Melissa and Doug they would test out the storage capability with their own puzzles.  If you purchase many of the Melissa and Doug puzzles you know their puzzles are bulky and take up some space due to the puzzle pieces being large.  Unfortunately, this storage case is not very good at storing these sort of puzzles.  The slanted edge also interferes with many of the puzzle pieces.  As a result, I give this puzzle holder a thumbs down.	-1
All the puzzles (all Melissa and Doug) get stuck in there. My 18m son gets so frustrated and we end up with puzzle pieces everywhere.	-1
Pain in the neck to get puzzles in and out correctly. But at least it keeps them Otha iced when not in use.	-1
It probably would be fine if we had only one kind of puzzle to put in there. Most of my son's puzzles didn't fit because they were too fat. So it has now become a nice little under the cabinet shelf for my bathroom cabinet.	-1
Nice piece but didn't fit any of our puzzles, all different brands including M&D	-1
I was a little disappointed when this was delivered, I should have read the description more closely though. I assumed being Melissa and Doug that it would fit most of their puzzles a d it doesn't fit any that we have. Our family has 5 Melissa and Doug puzzles and unfortunately we can't use it for any of them.	-1
Chunky puzzle don't slide all the way in, they stick out about 3 inches. If you don't mind them sticking out. Then give this rack a try.	-1
Like others have said, maybe 1 out of every three puzzles fit properly. Not sure why Melissa and Doug would put out a puzzle organizer that's not universal for all their puzzles. My main gripe is that if the puzzle pieces are designed to sit further towards the outer edge of the puzzle board, then you can't slide the puzzle into it's slot. We have 5 chunky puzzles and only one fits without having the remove the pieces first. Wish I hadn't bought this. It's sitting in my yard sale pile now.	-1
I think this was the biggest WASTE of money.  I don't know what kind of "standard" puzzle size they were talking about.  I have numerous unisized wooden Melissa &  Doug puzzles and THEY DO NOT STACK AT ALL LIKE PICTURED. I'm MIFFED.  Maybe the puzzles are standard and they sent me the wrong thing.  Although somewhat pricey for what it is, I thought it would bring order to my playroom and it certainly does not!  Nevertheless, it's not worth further emotions to investigate or return.  JUST STATE THE DIMENSIONS as in "fits puzzles A" by B".  Standard my arse.	-1
I'm not sure what size puzzles this was actually made for but it doesn't even hold half of ours.  Yes, they are Melissa and Doug brand, and no, most of them are not chunky.  It's useless to us and I'm so disappointed with this product.  In order to get even a few to work in this we had to put them in all cock- eyed.  You're better off just storing your puzzles in some sort of box or plastic storage bin.  Don't waste your money on this!	-1
I have two of the chunky standard size puzzles from Melissa & Doug and they DO NOT fit in this piece.  Very unhappy.	-1
I thought this would be a good way to store the many puzzles I have for my grandchildren, but ended up donating it to a daycare nearby.  Most of the puzzles I had did not fit it.  Apparently only Melissa & Doug puzzles are sure to fit it.	-1
Not a fan at all....I have a boatload of Melissa and Doug puzzles and thought this would be great....half of them do not fit properly and it tips over easily. I was hoping to attach it to a wall at some point and maybe it would work better.	-1
We own about a dozen Melissa and Doug puzzles. I normally love their products, but this puzzle storage case stinks. Only one of our puzzles fit in it! It is poorly designed and hard to get the puzzles in and out, especially if they have chunky pieces. I know in the description it names the size puzzle it fits, but it does not take into account the chunky puzzles which fit without the pieces in but are too high to fit when when the pieces are in.	-1
Does not hold the chunky puzzles, only the thin ones like the magnet flip.  Very dissapointed!  Waste of money.  Can't believe that Mellissa & Doug's name is on this horrible product.	-1
THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON PURCHASING THE 2011 VERSION OF THIS ITEM. IT HAS BEEN CHANGED BEFORE, SO IT MAY BE DIFFERENT NOW! THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE ITEM I PURCHASED FROM AMAZON IN 2011.  This does not fit standard size puzzles well.  We have one of the puzzles pictured, and it does not fit!  From the picture you can see that it is a trapezoidal rack.  The front end, where you insert the puzzle, is too wide.  It is not until you have the puzzle about halfway back that it actually is resting on both sides.  This makes it very easy to accidentally insert the puzzle on two different levels.  The puzzles then slide around quite a bit, making it easy to try to pull one puzzle out and have 3 more come crashing down with it.  We are returning this rack immediately.  This is probably a flaw in the redesign.  As you can tell, most of the negative reviews are from when it was redesigned without the pads.  This should be listed as a new item on Amazon, because the reviews are very misleading.  THIS IS A NEWER MODEL - NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE GETTING THE GOOD REVIEWS!  We went to Target today and bought the Circo puzzle storage rack.  It was $19.99, which is more expensive, but it comes with 4 puzzles.  So, it's worth it overall.  And the Circo rack has a nice tight fit to secure the puzzles, but not so tight that little hands can't get them out.	-1
I have had this for over a year and only used it for a few months. The top racks don't hold the puzzles right. The puzzles also come out of the rack to easily. I had this sitting on a dresser for awhile but even with a slight bump to it the puzzles would fall out, so I moved it to the floor and still had the same problem. Now I just have the puzzles stacked by themselves on the floor and it is better than using this rack. I say don't waste your money, just find somewhere to stack the puzzles and forget it.	-1
I can remember when Fisher-Price toys were a whole lot friendlier...all the characters have weapons and "fierce" expressions.  A friend of mine bought this for her three yr old daughter because she saw the box and begged, then after it was opened, the girl refused to play with the "mean people".  The concept is good, but why does it have to be so violently oriented?	-1
Did I get it wrong? End of the song Elmo says "Elmo's pooped". Yes I understand what that means, but it is totally not proper words for younger kids to learn. I don't like it. Other than that, it works good. No problem at all.	-1
Don't waste your money...the kids find it funny for the first day..then it ends up at the bottom of the toy box never to be touched again.	-1
This game is fun, but yet the only reason I bought it was because it was VERY cheap for Black Friday sale online. It's really TOO easy to tip it over, and as an adult I couldn't even play 2 turns before it would tip over so easily. My 7 year old son got so frustrated with being unable to get any turns in as it would tip over, he doesn't even want to play it anymore. Too challenging for even an adult.	-1
I bought this game along with several other games that our whole family could play (kids ages 6-12). I was looking for games that were fun, and gave younger kids a chance to win as much as older kids/adults. The set up was frustrating. It was very hard to keep the game balanced to get all the pieces on. It took 2 adults. I could not have set this up alone (and I consider myself having good motor skills). My 6 year old had alot of trouble with this game, a hard time getting the "fork tool" under the pieces. After playing the game twice it was not a game that made family fun night fun. We won't keep this game in our regular rotation. I bought games like kerplunk, scavenger hunt, hungry hippos, and tumblin monkeys that work alot better for our families age range. I can see the value in the game for working with kids with fine motor skills issues.	-1
I bought this for my wife to play with my grandson...this was one of her favorites as a child (and mine, too).  How disappointed we were to see how much the game had shrunk since our youth.  The decreased size made the game much harder (even with our steadier 'adult' hands, and almost impossible for our (then) 8-year old grandchild.  To add insult to injury, the 'little man' on the perch has been replaced by a nondescript pointy-shaped object.  I shouldn't be surprised, a lot of the children's classics that are being reprinted now are horrendously cheap imitations of what they once were.  No wonder so many young people prefer video games!  SHAME ON YOU, MATTEL!!!	-1
After only a few days the mats started to curl up.  We kept using them for awhile anyway, but it wasn't long before we had to pitch them.  No mats = no game.  I guess I could try to make my own to replace them.  The command voice is way too quiet.  He's also much too quick to jump to the next command, which makes playing nearly impossibly for littler kids, and it will be too boring/easy for most older kids.  It doesn't give them enough time to process the command before it's off to the next thing.  If they don't know it pat, they miss out on that command.  I did find that it got repetitive awfully quickly.  Every once in awhile I'd hear an unusual command that we hadn't heard before (like "spin to a vegetable") which mixed it up a little and made it more fun, but not often.  Overall not worth a purchase.	-1
Honestly, my kids (2.5 and 6.5 years) loved this the first two times they played it. After that, the thrill was gone. My daughter kept asking "what else can we do?" because it's the same directions over and over. And, even with just two kids, the voice isn't loud enough that we could hear it. I can't imagine tryin gto hear it over a group of children. This game is SO not worth $25. A game of "simon says" is free and a whole lot more fun and creative. The educational value of this game is pretty low. I don't think a parent needs to pay $25 for a child to learn basic shapes and colors and to recognize a handful of animals, instruments, and food.  For the life of me, I can't see why this game got so many great reviews. I will say that the construction of the game is decent and the marketig/packaging are top notch. The game itself, however, is quite dull even to a toddler. Simon says:"Save your money!"	-1
bought as used but even after changing the batteries it would not work;	-1
The music box does not work and the wheel handle is easily jammed that makes the wheel moves clumsily.	-1
On Christma my daughter was overjoyed with the toy pushing it all over the house while everyone laughed. now she has discovered if she just sits on it it'll talk. Big waste of money for me.	-1
This toy is very cheap. The hose is in the way. You can't do anything with it since it is short. Pretending isn't fun when my two yr old granddaughter cant get the handle down. Company called this new? I just don't think so.	-1
Thank goodness it is Christmas morning and there are plenty of other toys to play with.  I bought this to go along with the grocery cart from leapfrog.  I thought it would be awesome and I disregarded what others had said about it getting jammed.  Well sure enough by the THIRD coin it got jammed!!! how ridiculous.  I wouldn't know how educational it is because it's not working.  durability --I will never know because this is going back!	-1
My daughter had a cash register which was cheap, didn't have a ringing sound and broke fairly quickly, so I decided to get her this one last Christmas, because it was made by Leapfrog and seemed to be durable and came with counting games.  What a mistake!  The only plus is that it's durable.  I mean, that's the ONLY plus.  Here's all the minuses:  1.  The coins jam extremely easily.  Luckily, there's a little access slot to unjam the coins.  When my daughter played with it the first two times, we put the cover for the slot back on.  The third time she played with it (and the third time it jammed) we threw the cover away, since we realized that every time she plays with it it was going to jam.  And it does!  My daughter likes putting the coins in very quickly and doing that it's easy for them to get stuck.  It takes a butter knife or a screw driver to unstick them.  I told her not to put the coins in too quickly, but she still does, and of course they jam again and again.  To say I'm sick of unjamming these coins every thirty seconds is an understatement.  2.  It's extremely loud.  Now, I have a very high tolerance for loud toys.  I grew up in a household where the TV was always on at full volume and everybody was always screaming at each other, so what others consider to be 'loud' toys, seem very reasonable to me.  So, take it from me...when I say this thing is extremely loud, for most people it would be unbearably, blow your eardrums off loud.  I would not be surprised if this thing registered a hundred decibels or more with one of those sound meter things.  Luckily, there is a volume control, but unfortunately when the cash register is first turned on, it's on the highest volume setting.  You have to click the volume button about fourteen times to get it to a reasonable setting (again, which to most people would still be considered loud).  At first, I thought my daughter was turning it up on purpose and yelled at her, thinking no toy company in their right mind would have the setting naturally that loud.  I felt like a total jerk when I realized that she wasn't doing it, and that Leapfrog wasn't in their right mind when the set the volume for this product.  If I had tried it out in a store and saw it was this noisy, I would have never bought it for her.  So, besides unjamming the coin slot every time, you also have to turn it down every time. (Don't expect your kid to do this--my daughter doesn't mind the rock concert volume at all.)  This is a huge minus for any parent who is not deaf and would like to stay that way.  3.  My daughter doesn't like the games.  My daughter at first played the games, but she got sick of them very quickly.  I think it's because they're a little too complicated for the age range, and like others have said, the games have too much talking and not enough action.  There also isn't a setting where the toy would function like a regular cash register.  When my daughter does play with it nowadays, it's usually with the toy turned off.  4.  There's nowhere to store the price tags.  Though the coins are large, and they all fit in the till, the price tags are too big to go in there too and with a toddler, that means a higher chance of misplacing them.  I like to have all the small parts accessible to my daughter so she doesn't have to dig through the toybox looking for them, but unfortunately, we're constantly hunting for the stupid price tags.  Though it looks like a very nice toy, I would not recommend it to anyone.  It's definitely more annoying, both to parents and children, than it is fun.	-1
The coins jam in ours very easily, We got it as a gift last christmas and it has been more of a pain than anything. When it works it is cute a little loud. I can't get this last jam unstuck, I'll probably end up thowing it out.	-1
Overall, I was not impressed with this play kit.  While the basket is very nice and useful, the vegetables and fruits feel like low quality lightweight plastic.  This would be fine, but they are not realistic looking either.  For instance, the grapes are huge while the pineapple is tiny.  Also, the entire eggplant is purple, including the stem.  The corn doesn't have good detail for the kernels.  I was hoping for a better quality than what I received... these toys are fine for my toddler to throw around.  Being so light, I'm not too worried about her throwing them and injuring other toddlers.  However, as she gets older I will want a more realistic and better designed play set of food.	-1
The best thing about this is the basket. The color of the food is so off I had a hard time even figuring out what everything was supposed to be. All of the food is made of cheap plastic and unless you have a fully carpeted house, you'll hear the loud clanging anytime a piece is dropped. Ended up throwing out the food and paying a little more for a much better quality.	-1
Oh my. These veggies are the hardest plastic, and the first thing my son did was dump the entire basket onto the hardwood floors. They immediately went back into the basket and got donated to the nursery at church where they have carpet. It sounded like a machine gun with all those little fruits and veggies hitting the floors. No bueno!	-1
This one may be tossed - tomorrow Bet your bottom dollar That tomorrow, it'll be gone Just thinking about, tomorrow Clears my brain from cobwebs and much sorrow It's no fun  When I'm stuck with a toy that's lame and boring I just stick out my chin and grin and say, ooooh  This kit will be tossed, tomorrow So I gotta hang on `til tomorrow For trash day  Tomorrow, tomorrow I love you, tomorrow You're only a day away  Okay, maybe a slight exaggeration there, but really, this toy can't hold a candle to the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Snap-Circuits-Jr-SC-100/dp/B00008BFZH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100</a>&nbsp;Educational kit by the same company.  For starters, this one requires a screwdriver and spanner to set up, and it's extremely unlikely that a typical eight year old will be able to do the (few) projects without adult help.  The instruction manual begins with line drawings and schematics for connecting circuits in series and in parallel, and continues with the calculation and formulation for such things as "how many rows of solar cells are needed to make a solar panel work for a solar musical unit of 4.5V 100mA"  After they make your head spin (without the help of a solar panel), when you get to page 10, they helpfully add "If you do not want to make any calculation, just skip and follow the simple instructions below", which is followed by a series of black and white illustrations with captions like "No. 2 screw connected to No. 4 screw with jumper wire"  After you get all this done, you need to ensure that the panel is in direct sunlight.  You can apparently use a 100W bulb 5 inches away from the panel, but only for 3 minutes, as the heat may melt the plastic frame. (!)  We connected the panel to the motor and fan today, and put the panel on a sunny window sill.  I'd like to say we were blown away, but as the kit includes no form of storage for the charge, every time a cloud passed over the sun we were out of the flying fan and into the fiery heat of the day.  You can also connect small appliances depending on the required voltage and amperage (up to 4.5V or up to 300mA), but without a battery and charge controller it won't be very effective.  While this kit has the right idea at heart, they need to work on the presentation (looks cheap), the ease of set up for the target audience (from 8 years old), the instruction manual, and above all, they need to offer a complete solar set-up that can actually make the projects work effectively.  This one is not likely to be a favorite for anyone of any age  Amanda Richards, January 1, 2009	-1
My first grader is all into science.  I bought this at Christmas time, but I didn't give it to her until now (May) as she had enough presents for Holiday.  We took it out and tried it today.  DID NOT WORK.  I helped her along the way making sure everything is connected the way it is and all the screws are tightened.  DID NOT WORK.  My daughter is very disappointed.  I am very disappointed.  She waited by the solar panel to start working for a long long time.  It was painful to watch....  I would NOT recommend this product.  I would have tried to return if this wasn't bought 5 months ago.	-1
It was my own fault. but I got it for JUST the solar panel and the light. It is neat.	-1
I do like Carcassonne, so we thought adding this expansion would be worth the $.  Well, you get 18 new tiles, 6 large meeples, a set of grey meeples to play with 6 players, and you also get 50/100 scoring chips in case a player loops the scoring track, but in our experience, they certainly could have left those out - unneeded.  The problems we had were the tiles seem to be a lot cheaper than in our original set - many of them tore or frayed at the edges as we were carefully trying to take them out.  Some of the backings are already coming off after 3 plays, so when they are faced down in the pile and mixed with the regular tiles, you can already see if you're going to get one of the new, special tiles.  So, I guess our biggest issue is that for the money, this really isn't worth it.  The box it comes in is a bit overkill, too.  As for adding to the original game, yes, it adds 3 new factors, but overall, it's not much different, really.  That said, if you've been dying to turn your regular Carcassonne into a 6 player game, well, this is a good way to do so.  We haven't needed 6 players yet, though.  :)	-1
filmsy, toys comes off after a period of time and also there is no hook if you don't have a center head rest!	-1
Meh.  It doesn't stay up well and flops over when you try to connect it to the headrest.  Couldn't really figure out how to get it to work, so we just gave up.  Tried to use it once for about 10 min.  Went in the garage after that.  Great idea, poor execution.	-1
I had hoped to use this for an upcoming road trip, but the only thing I received was the blue clips to attach it to seat.  The main product was missing.  Worse, when I returned it, I didn't receive credit for the full amount.  This seems very unfair given that this was the fault of Amazon and not my own.	-1
Borderline junk.  Maybe the product description was right and I didn't fully read it.  But whatever I got didn't match the picture.  It's a flimsy poly-felt material.  No structure to it.  I'm pretty sure it was missing a piece required to loop it around the seat head...  I wouldn't know for sure, though, since there were no instructions.  I attempted to install it in my car (Mazda5) and abandoned it.  It's not worth the effort to return via mail...  If I had bought this at a brick and mortar store I would have.	-1
Not as I expected	-1
Didn't catch the attention of my 6 month old at all! Hangings were pretty far to reach. I'm instead buying a handheld musical toy to keep her quiet in her car seat!	-1
This item is a hazard and should not be used in the car. It's okay for cribside use, but there are better things out there.	-1
I could not get this to attach appropriately to our Town and Country AND the nose of the critter in the middle (bumblebee??) was nearly detached when it arrived.	-1
I can't get it to stay up.	-1
I bought this game due to the high reviews but I was disappointed. I can tell it is a decent game that has a lot of set in stone stragety and once you learn that stragety your just doing the same thing every game.  If you don't follow the obvious you'll lose. I would not recommend this game for any reason other than to play a game that was the best for many years many years ago.  Also the componets are rather plain and boring to look at.	-1
These cards were a big disappointment.  My son (age 8) loves science and loves quizzes so I thought he'd enjoy this game.  The questions are poorly designed -- mostly True/|False or Yes/No questions.  Most of the questions are too easy/obvious for a reasonably well-read 8 year old.  My son declared them to be "boring" after just a few cards and I had to agree.  Will now take them to a charity shop.  Sadly, thinking the idea of the cards was good, I bought two other sets (art and US Presidents). Based on this sample, I'll leave the other two unopened and donate them as well.  There are much better "educational" games available.  Don't waste money on this one!	-1
I can't believe so many people gave this game high marks... It's rather depressing to realize so many people are limited by their exposure to better boardgames. I am a hardcore boardgame enthusiast. I've played over 50 different games of this type. That is saying alot since each one of these games could take up to 3hrs or more. Puerto Rico is a low-medium depth game. For a group who is familiar with complex games, the rules can take about 10min. You can figure out the strategies yourself after the first three rounds. Just when the game can take off, it's momentum is handicapped by the shipping rules. Each player must get rid of all his/her goods regardless if they want to or not. There are too many equalizers and caps on trade/barter that keep the game from really being competitive. Instead, it feels like the mechanics constrict the play too much to be really enjoyable. There is no breathing room to really out-strategize anyone. There was a comment by someone in another review that said the game was well-balanced since the scores were always super close. That only means the game rewards bad playing and punishes good playing to keep the scores neck and neck - an exact definition of an equalizer. What is the point of playing if the winner is decided by mechanics that make the verdict random? The lack of competition snuffs out the will to play. I found this game totally tedious and frustrating. So did all the players who tried it with me. We had one person who knew the game and reluctantly taught it to us (she never liked the game). I won the game by the way, and I hate it. So that speaks volumes...  P.S. How to win: I saw the best strategy right away. Get as much money as possible, as early as possible. Purchase the bonus victory points; the cards that cost around 9-10coins. Once you have at least one, end the game right away so others don't catch up. Fulfill the requirements of the bonus card while concurrently ending the game. Victory...easy	-1
Broke shortly after my son took it out of the box. Very cheaply made and thin plastic. Got to play with it for about an hour Christmas morning before the battery pack broke into pieces.	-1
It's not very playable, and the components don't come assembled.  The pieces tend to want to fall off, and there's more particle board-type material than I would have liked since the product is advertised as wood.	-1
my kids were so excited and loved it.. but the "knob" that strikes the ball in to play broke the first time it was used - it stuck and won't unstick. will try to get a replacement because my kids love it so much (10 and 8, both boys).	-1
Unstable pieces and, most annoyingly, the mechanism that shoots the ball up came unglued in 3 different places! Looks nice, but if you will actually be using it, prepare to need to fix it often.	-1
Save your money.  This was broken upon receipt.  We had to break out the pliers on day one to fix the bat that swings back. My son never plays with it.	-1
junky it came defective. And looked very junky... it probably would last about 2 tries from my 7 year old. don't get	-1
I bought this game for my son for Christmas. As I went to assemble this item, there was glue all over the baseball field and other parts of the game. After assembling, the flipper at the bottom would not hold the weight of the metal ball, it would just bend back. It defeats the whole purpose of the game. I was very disappointed.	-1
Purchased two games. One came with a broken bat assembly which I was successful gluing. However, the pitching mechanism is faulty and only lasted a couple games. As of right now, I have been unable to fix that.  Very cheaply made overall, and a huge disappointment. It looked great, it sounded great, but the performance was very much lacking. I am just hoping that the second unit which I have as a gift will work better than the unit which we kept.  Today is New Year's Day and the kids opened it Christmas Day. It sat unused until this morning due to the broken bat assembly. I glued that this morning and now tonight the game is unusable again.	-1
The problem with the game is laughable actually.  The tension spring for the bat is installed in the wrong direction. The bat actually snaps backwards - so if you want to hit the "ball" - you have to fight the spring and have excellent timing.  I gave thought to actually trying to take apart the game and install it correctly - but the construction is so pathetic and such cheap parts are used - that I nixed the idea and decided to return it.	-1
Does not make enough sound to interest a child.  Disappointed.	-1
Sound lame	-1
Does not make a musical sound. Very disappointed.	-1
Very disappointed with the lack of sound of the wood chimes.  WoUld not recommend it to any others.  Sorry not so good.	-1
It works and it's wood, which was important to my daughter.  I thought it had very little variation in the tone from one piece to the next. She finally gave it away as it's not worth the storage space for a non musical toy.	-1
The product is beautiful but I wasn't impressed with the actual sound of the product.  I know that it is a toy and for play, but I still thought it was important that the sound was pleasant!	-1
This "xylophone" is super cute and stylish. However, It is NOT an instrument. The keys are made out of wood. 2 of the keys sound different. The others sound the same, like you were banging on wood. You cant play anything on this. It is for looks only. A child would get a better sound hitting a picket fence with a stick. I returned it for a proper kid's xylophone.	-1
A good xylophone is hard to find, and unfortunately this isn't one of them. When making a musical instrument such as a xylophone, the very least one can do is create one with the correct pitch. This atonal mess is good for teaching kids how to play percussion only; might as well buy a drum. I disagree with other reviewers that incorrect pitch is harmless - kids learn at an amazing speed, even as babies, and as they get older they will want to play the songs they love! I would not buy this xylophone when there are so many others to choose from.	-1
This toy is adorable.  It is well made and very colorful.  However, it makes NO noise.  It just sounds like wood being hit on wood.  There are no real note differentiations between the keys.  They all sound the same: "CLUNK CLINK CLUNK."  It's not rewarding at all for baby to use!  She banged on it a few times and now just bites on the drum stick.	-1
It is pretty, but it sounds terrible. You cannot play anything resembling a tune. Save your money and buy a toy that has actual notes. I love the Fisher price baby grand piano that has a complete octave.	-1
I'm so disappointed with toy. It is cheaply made and not well made. None of the parts fit well. I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. It a huge waste of money. She has never play with it. I would pass on this toy if I were you.	-1
We have not even had this toy for 24 hours & already I'm ready to return it!  NOTHING stays together... NOT ONE SINGLE PIECE!  Every stage falls apart, every balcony falls off, the crown won't stay together, even the hot air ballon "strings" keeps falling apart!  Would NEVER in a million years purchase this again!  SO SO SO dissappointed!  My daughter wanted this SO badly... we are so upset!  I wish I had taken other people's review seriously & not gotten it for her...  I guess I'll start gluing tomorrow!	-1
Give me a break Hasbro!  I spent hours putting this toy together.  It fell apart as soon as it was consructed.  I was so furious, I called HASBRO for a refund.  What a disappointment!  It is so cheaply made that it can't be played with!!!	-1
From the moment we bought this toy, we were absolutely shocked with how horribly it was made. The pieces did not snap together properly whatsoever. While I was connecting one part, another piece fell off. I could not even handle this toy with out it falling to pieces... imagine a 3 year old trying to enjoy this!! It had the potential to be very cool, since it has a lot of great colors and neat things for the ponies to do, but since it broke every time we even so much as moved it, I had to throw it out. Don't waste your money on this!!!	-1
I bought this toy for my one year old niece.  We were looking for toys to help her learn to comfort herself and go back to sleep on her own.  We were hoping for a toy that played soft, soothing music and gently glowed.  However, that is not what this toy does.  The "songs" are so loud they can be heard over all noise in a busy room (tv, talking, ringing phone, etc.) and in a quiet room it was so loud the noise made ME jump.  Also, the toy is very heavy and the hard plastic center that houses the music device can be felt easily through the padding.  My glowworm did not come with a book, either, even though the picture indicated it did.  I have written Hasbro about the quality of this product and I hope that if you want a nap time or bedtime toy for your child you will buy the vintage version instead.  Some things don't need "improving".	-1
Heavy and too hard to play it.	-1
It was nice but we returned it because it was smaller then I intisapated. I wanted it for a older child this one is great for a toddler.	-1
way to much money - really made cheap - won't last long at all.	-1
To expensive and toy quality sound. Was disappointed as other reviewers had praised it. Used for two minutes and then left in a corner.	-1
When I was a little girl, I had a family wooden accordion that I loved. Never became even close to proficient, but it was a source of hours of enjoyment.  My granddaughter saw this in a catalog and expressed interest in it. Yes, it's obviously plastic and small but, especially based on more favorable reviews, I thought she'd enjoy it.  When it arrived, I removed it from the box to examine it. Tested it for ease of operation. I wasn't expecting heft and high quality sound from a $25 toy, merely a pleasant experience and broader experience in creating music.  My first observation was that, although the bass keys on the left had reasonable quality of sound and audible volume, the treble keys on the right were lacking in both areas. The sound of the treble keys was very weak, more of a wheeze. The bellows took some effort to inflate, especially in ratio to the lack of sound produced.  This stiffness might decline with more use, but it's the first thing that I noticed.  Then one of the treble keys became stuck. Apparently,  it was set slightly askew and pressing it made it jam under the board and unable to return, resulting in a permanent, weak background wail.  I'm glad that so many people have had a good experience with this toy. I'm simply reporting mine. It may simply be a quality control issue, but I've opted to return it.	-1
My child did not play with this toy.  The buttons broke off posing a choking hazard.  Some other detail is stuck inside and is ratteling.	-1
Good product over all. The over door does not stay shuts. Opens by its self. Wish this was fixes. Bad mold	-1
I purchased this kitchen because of all of the great reviews it has received.  Now, after having put it together, I am very shocked that so many people like this product.  The good: The kitchen is attractive, the plastic is sturdy enough, and it is lightweight enough that you can easily move it around, yet it won't topple over.  Also, the electronic functions are cute.  The bad: I don't know where to begin.  First of all, the microwave, oven, and fridge are SO SO SO small.  I guess if I had looked more closely to the picture, I would have noticed that pre-purchase. My fault.  I guess the positive reviews saying that the kitchen is "roomy" just deceived me.  My child's previous kitchen (an older model Little Tykes Country Kitchen) was FAR superior in this regard.  That model had a wonderfully large fridge, microwave, oven, and dishwasher.  This model's appliances are just too small, period.  And my child is only 2.  Also, the two white pull-out drawers (below the microwave and above the "bread basket") easily fly right out when you open them.  Poor construction--there is no simple latch or catch to keep them attached to the unit.  Both very useless drawers.  Attaching the electronic pieces (of which there are 5, I believe) is an absolutely maddening process.  They simply do not screw into the unit the way they should.  Also, as other reviewers have reported, you have to unscrew each unit every time you want to change the batteries.  Should have been designed with a simple latch, bracket, or cradle to keep the electronic pieces in their respective spots.  The keypad that goes above the oven is SO difficult to screw in, that I have jerry-rigged it instead with velcro.  Easy on, easy off.  Overall, I am not overly pleased with this product.  If it wasn't already assembled, I would return it.  Do yourself a favor, and pick up the Little Tykes Country Kitchen on eBay: a FAR superior product.  There aren't a whole lot of "bells and whistles" on it, but the product itself is bigger, sturdier, and simpler.	-1
Cute enough when assembled, if you ever get that far. I offered to put this together for a friend's child, and was moved to tears. Seriously.  The holes are not predrilled, so you better have an electric screwdriver or this is not happening. Things are slipping apart as you try to screw them together. You will never get the battery powered sound controls for the oven attached, so surrender that fantasy right now. Worst of all though was the hole in the sink that you need to pop the facuet through: they either switched the base size of the faucet or the hole in the sink, because they hole was much too small. I ended up having to get out the Dremmel to make it bigger, and then it was fine, but I fail to see how they could have overlooked this and not mentioned that power tools were a necessity if you wanted to get this thing standing within a reasonable timeframe. When they say an electric screwdriver is optional... it's not.  its junky and I would go with a wood one if I was you.	-1
I will leave the flimsy plastic tank, the need for spring water, extra short lifespan, and very little hatching to the other reviewers.  As a preschool teacher the thing that bothered me the most was all of the warnings about the water containing germs.  With all the hand washing warnings I first thought that it was for the aquasuars safety...however, it is for your own safety.  This was not on the outside of the box, but the instructions warn about water germs over and over again.  On top of that, they NEVER let on to what these germs are and how harmful they are....just that you can get real sick.  With young kids in my program, they could not touch or really be involved with the project, and it was a waste of money....not to mention another set is out there that sells them under the real name (tri-something) along with what we know best as sea monkeys sorry the real names of both escapes me now)...that set was $12 for both sold at Michaels of all places!	-1
Super cheap and flimsy.  Zero hatched.	-1
I bought this after reading great reviews and recommendations. A year later, I have to say I just don't understand all the great reviews. There is fairly little in this kit for the price. The games suggested in the booklet are mostly variations on classic games that everyone already knows. The beanbags are not especially well sewn and the plastic buckets are flimsy.	-1
It was okay.  The experiments are nothing to write home about.  Pretty basic and not too exciting.	-1
So, there are a range of these sorts of kits and we bought a couple for our four year old son who loves to do experiments in the kitchen. Most of his experiments involve just mixing a bunch of stuff from the pantry together so we thought this would be an improvement. It was not. The materials were super-cheap and would not have been hard to buy separately and less expensively. Also there are a lot of directions to follow for a kit for someone young. And the experiments were not very interesting or fun. Much better just to get food coloring, some white vinegar and baking soda and do things with that in your kitchen. Buy an eye dropper and a few small bowls from Goodwill and... viola! You'll be set. Parts of this remind me of the children's museums we go to with our son. All sorts of posters and charts that explain things and ask questions, but really children learn by doing! They can ask their own questions and do not need (or want) an adult to read them a handout that asks, "What happens when you mix blue and red?" Stick with your kitchen supplies and food coloring and don't waste your money on this.	-1
This came it quite a beat up box and there aren't enough supplies in it to do all of the experiments.  I had to make a few alterations.	-1
I agree with all the reviews here - the good AND the bad.  The set is cheap, chintzy, and NOT worth the money for the materials.  The magnifying glass is...well, I wouldn't even call it cheap plastic.  Just impossible to see anything through it.  The droppers are cheap and I am sure will not hold up to repeated use.  The plastic cups are the kind they use to give you 2 pills in the hospital - disposable plastic.  The entire kit is based solely on color mixing using Crayola tub tints!  I almost had a fit - I have a jar of 50 of them in the bathroom!  Color mixing is all you get here.  That being said - my 4 1/2 year old loved it.  Felt like a real scientist with her dropper and what-not.  So, was it worth the twenty dollars?  Not from a materials stand point.  But for watching my daughter learn and discover and become jazzed about experiments even more than she was (if that's possible), then yes, it was worth it.  It was definitely worth Mom learning a lesson on buying good quality materials and borrowing experiment idea books from the library!	-1
the spatula came broken a complete disappointment didn't open it till this morning for my sons birthday and it was already broken when I took it out the amazon box.	-1
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!  Melissa & Doug missed the boat on this one!  DOESN"T HAVE A LID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We already had a very similar set that is pizza themed and my kids love it, so when this showed up as a 1/2 price deal before Christmas, I figured the kids would like it, too.  The HUGE issue, is that the pizza set has a clear plastic lid that slides on.  NOT SO with the birthday cake set.  Seriously!  Melissa & Doug should know better!  This set has a whole bunch of small pieces and NO LID to keep them contained.  Sure, they come in a nice wooden box with sections to keep it organized.... but no lid makes this very difficult to store.  If I would have known the set didn't have lid, I wouldn't have bought it.  Pretty ridiculous.	-1
My son got this as a Christmas gift this last Christmas (he's 3). He really likes it but I don't. It's hard to serve the cake because the spatula is more round and you can't fit a lot of the decorations on there. If you want the "Happy Birthday" piece on there, you are out of luck to fit a lot of sprinkles on there which leaves quite a bit of blank areas. You also can't cut the cake without removing the birthday saying. My son enjoys it though and the quality is good as most Melissa and Doug products are but I would probably rethink this toy.	-1
I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. The Velcro is crap, you can see the glue holding it on and it falling apart. She hasn't played with it enough for the paint to come off as others have mentioned. I just expected better.	-1
One of my children was given this as a birthday gift, and while the kids like it okay and do play with it some, I have a few issues with it. First, as others have mentioned, there is no lid to the box. Annoying! Secondly, the paint does come off the pieces! Of course, being "food", kiddos are going to put pieces in their mouths to pretend-eat it. (Even though I always tell them not to!) It is very obvious which pieces have been in kids' mouths, due to the paint chipping and wearing off. Even if it's lead-free, it's not a great thing to have happen! Third, there are just too many little pieces for this mom's preference and I end up finding them strewn all through the house. And finally, it's just odd to me that the two of the cake toppings are jelly beans and gumdrops. Overall, I do not like this toy and would not recommend it to others.	-1
Do not buy this toy, it has the chemical Bromine which is a component in a family of fire-retardant chemicals known as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) [...]	-1
Overpriced...	-1
The description was kind of misleading.  I definitely thought I was getting more than one tube.  $6.49 SALE price for this was outrageous.	-1
You know, I am not one to rate something low and I already have Badger products that I love, but THIS product came BROKEN in THREE ways. The velcro on the doors are stapled, fine.  The other piece, the one that attaches to the door--glued and floating around, so not really glued.  There are two places where the nails are completely stripped....just slide right in. Great.  And, the topper, the piece where the velcro is supposed to be attached to has three prescrewed sections and glue--but mine, not even attached.  So, my options are to rig it or return it.  UGH.  It is cute, I must say.  BUT, the staples on the cloth even look pretty shotty.  Not sure that this will look good for long.  I am just very disappointed.  UGH	-1
Once we got it together it's fine but two pieces were broken and another had a chip out of it. I had to add glue to put them back together. It was a birthday gift for my daughter and if I returned it I wouldn't have gotten another till after her bday so I made do. It wasn't the end of the world and the closet came out okay for her dolls.	-1
It just isn't very rugged.  Seems it isn't built for the right age group.  It would probably last fine for older girls, who are more able to treat things delicately, but... those girls don't play with dolls anymore.  Little girls that play with dolls need this kind of thing to be able to handle less nimble hands and fingers that may get a little rougher sometimes.  The design is really cute and made it very popular... while it lasted.	-1
i don't like it don't waste your money on this, it dissolves very slow the animals are not that big, my baby losses interest immediately it doesnt have much of a shape of a animal too.	-1
They really didn't work all that well.  It took a bit of finagling to break the capsule even after floating in the tub for 20 minutes.	-1
Is too tiny and fragile	-1
Is too tiny and fragile	-1
I remember these as a kid, so I was eager to show them off to my own kids.  The package came ripped and looked like it had already been through the wash.  None of the capsules broke apart by themselves...we had to pick them apart.  Sponges were tiny and blobbish.  Not worth it.	-1
Didn't work...	-1
My son loves spy gear, but this was a huge waste of money. I have no idea were it is now and after getting this item, he barely touched it. Also multi pieces easily lost. It really doesnt do much.	-1
Bought this as a family game. The questions are so hard most adults can't even answer them.	-1
We have tried 2 different versions of crayola bathtub crayons, and while this one lasts longer on the tub, IT LASTS LONGER ON THE TUB. We had to scrub to get it off, and even resorted to a magic eraser to get it off. The 'cheaper' version washes off with water and hand rubbing.	-1
I was super excited to get these bath crayons for my daughter. She loves to color and she loves to bath. It was the perfect combination. She LOVED them. Entertained her so much! BUT i hate them. They are washable and wash right out but they leave the water dark. When I drained her bathtub the first time there was a black line where the water level was. It wouldn't just wash off. I had to get my AJAX bleach and scrub the crap out of it to get rid of the black line. Everytime she uses them it's a process to get the tub white again. Other then that she loves them and they last okay. I wouldn't recommend them unless you really REALLY love to clean.	-1
My grandson loves these crayons, but I won't buy them again.  They are really hard to clean off the tub.  I needed to use cleanser to get the crayon off.  Get the tub markers instead - they just rinse off when you are done.	-1
This sells for $6 on crayolastore dot com It is disgusting how Amazon allows merchants to overprice children's toys on their site!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The current Amazon merchant price of over $20  then PLUS SHIPPING COSTS, is absolutely ridiculous.	-1
I wouldn't buy this again. It's not fun especially it it's mostly adults and one child.  We had to cheat so he could win.	-1
This is a revised / updated version of the game.  The old one had better parts!  I purchased this in 2008 and again in 2015.  The 2008 version had 'grosser' game pieces.. It had a dirty diaper, bird poop, an eyeball.. this version doesn't have those or anything really gross at all.  That was part of the appeal.  Still comes with blank cards to make your own pieces, and it's still a fun game to play.	-1
This was *way* too easy a game to play with my four year old nephew.  After the initial appeal of it being a head full of gunk wears off, the game itself is really for a very young child.	-1
Disappointed. I thought the pockets would be seprate instead it is just one big hole.  The game is to easy even for a two year old. I can not recomend it.	-1
Wanted to love this cute concept but after one time of playing won't play again even if u add own household items too easy to figure out even boring for my 6 yr old	-1
Neds head does not stay up or in the shape it should be.  It just keeps falling flat on itself.  The kids thought it was great, but it got old pretty quick.	-1
Maybe my kids are too old at 7+ but none of us can stand this game.  It looks cheap, plays cheap, and tends to dissolve into fights.  What is the point?  Sticking your hand into some weird guy's half head and pullng out bugs, aliens, and cheese?  No thank you.	-1
What kind of sick game is this? I mean pulling bugs,food and other nasties out of someone's head and also how did Ned get all those things in his head without killing himself in the first place? Who came up with this game? The Guys who made the Cool World movie? How do you even win let alone lose at this game? I give this game a 0 out of 10.	-1
We got this game for several age levels from 2-8. No one liked it. It kept their interest for only a few moments. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!	-1
My kids (3 boys ages 4,6,8) played the game about 3 times- initally they loved it because we got to talk about gross stuff (ear wax, vomit, etc) but after playing about 3 games with it- they declared it "boring".	-1
Our son, now one year old, has liked the leap pad since we got it several months ago.  He pushes the buttons to hear the music and sound effects.  However he also is fascinated by the slot where the sound card is inserted.  He keeps pulling out the sound card which makes it hard to read the books to him.  If Leap Frog designed this to secure the sound card then our son might not be distracted by pulling it out so much.	-1
I have to agree with most of the parents here. I bought this product when my son was around 7 months and he didn't take ANY interest in it and still doesn't now. he likes to listen to me read to him from other books and even turn the pages (he's 1 now), but this one just doesn't hold his attention. I believe the pages should be heavier (a 6 month old can not turn flimsy pages!) the buttons have to be pushed pretty hard as well and small hands can't do that either. leap frog seriously needs to work on this product and offer a call back or refund on this product.	-1
We bought this for our 1 1/2 year old for Christmas along with a bunch of books and the carry case.  What a waste of money.  She likes my 4 year olds leappad because of the pencil.  Thinking this was more for her age, I got this one.  I wish I didn't She hasn't even looked at it for more than 2  minutes at a time.	-1
I'm a big fan of Leapfrog toys, but this one was disappointing.  Little fingers cannot push hard enough to activate the books.  We didn't get much use out of it.	-1
I bought this for my son for christmas when he was 14 months old. He never really liked it. You have to push the pages to hard for them to say anything. my son is now 2 and he still cant really get them to say anything. I think Really an adult has to be the one to push the buttons so that makes the kids upset because they cant get the book to say anything. I really would recomend not wasteing your money on this. It is kinda expensive.	-1
I wish this Leap Pad had lived up to its potential! I was so excited when it came out just in time for my 3rd child.  My older two had greatly enjoyed Leappad products, and I was eager to start my youngest on them too.  I bought the Little Touch and 3 book sets right away.  My daughter was too young at first to try them.  I first gave it a try when she was 6 months, and she had no interest.  So I tried again at 9 months.  This time she was VERY interested, but it was a totally frustrating time for her.  She caught on right away she needed to touch the pages, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't touch hard enough.  She broke into tears after a short time.  I tried touching for her, but she has little interest in books unless she can hold and mouth them.  She tried holding the pages, and badly wrinkled several of them.  It's not really a fun learning experience when you are constantly saying "no"!  I do like the whole idea of this product, and I think that if they overcame some of the engineering problems, it would be quite nice.  I like the different levels, so that you can just hear music, or hear simple phrases, or hear the whole book.  The activity cards included with each book also seem a bit more heavy duty than the regular books, but they too greatly frustrated us in terms of being touchable!  I also question including Where the Wild Things Are as one of the books.  I love the book, and my sons do too, but it's NOT a baby book---it's probably fine for 3 and up, but not really something a baby would relate to.  I think it's a choice to draw in parents, not babies.  I might try the similar Fisher-Price product if I can find it for a low price.  Sorry, Leap Pad!	-1
When this 1st came out I was so excited, I purchased all 6 of the additional books sets and couldn't wait for my daughter to be old enough to play with it! Well, now that my daughter is old enough, I'm really disappointed. You have to press down really hard to get the areas you want to work. So hard I can't imagine a young toddler being able to do so. It frustrates my daughter so much that she now just grabs my hand and puts it to the picture she wants me to press down on. As all toddlers do, she loves to turn the book on and off. Not good for this since it looses all information on what level you are on and you must push the green go circle on every page, needless to say the only thing my daughter can do is turn the book on and off! The books are cute and have a lot of neat sounds and saying, it's just right now this just absolutely frustrates my daughter!  We are much happier with Mattel's Learn Through Music.	-1
My son is 5 and loves matchbox cars.  He has a lot of matchbox toys and plays with matchbox stuff every day.  This is without a doubt the worst matchbox set ever.  It's poorly made, the ramps don't fit together properly and are very cheaply made.  The right sparkplug-shaped lever doesn't do anything and the whole thing is really pathetic.  It also only works with some matchbox cars and the car inside did not match what was on the box.	-1
We bought this for our son at 6-months and then it it was nice because it was great for story time to hear music and soundscapes. However, it was no more fun (or animated) than when we read our paper books with lots of sound effects. Now he's 16-months and only turns it on and off because the touch pad is too difficult to activate for little fingers. His favorite book to hear is "Mr. Brown can Moo can You". This is a great book with lots of sounds but my son can't get it to work on his own. So this toy is only good when I am playing with him. In that case, I prefer to cuddle up with a good old fashioned hard bound Mr Brown and make my own "Moo".  I should have waited for the other leap pads. I hear they're great.	-1
My son has had this since he was 6 months old - now he is 17 months old and has never had any interest in it.  He loves books but not this.  Would rather just get $35 worth of books you can use for years and years.	-1
this seems like a marvelous toy, but we have been quite disappointed in it. My son received it last Christmas and it has never been a big hit. it is just too difficult for a child under 3 to understand the concepts of changing settings, pressing the "go" circle each time you turn the page and of course little hands are going to pull the story book cards out. frankly, likes his Clifford the Big Red Dog regular books much better.  Think very seriously before you invest, because of course it only comes with one book. wish we has skipped this one.	-1
I love Leapfrog toys. My daughter loves all the ones we have and they are educational and durable. This toy was my first choice to take with us on vacation for the hotel and the plane. What a mistake. The concept is very good however many things need improvement. The books that you use with this have thin cardboard pages. My daughter had destroyed a few pages in a week. Also when you turn on the page you have to press go for the reader to know which page your on. This frustrated my daughter who would turn pages and touch the pages only to have it reading the previous page. She had a little more fun with the card that is included with the book but it occupied her for a very short while. My daughter likes to do things on her own so even when I tried to help her with this we ended up more frustrated than anything. We then went out and bought the Fisher Price Learn Through Music and have had much success with it instead. We are saving this for when my daughter is a little older and will be able to control this better. It is a very good toy but I feel it is better suited to children old enough to exhibit the patience this toy requires to properly play with it. my daughter is almost 2 and very smart but this was one toy that truly frustrated and upset her to the point where she'd throw it aside and play with something else.	-1
This walker is not very sturdy.  It tips over easily.  The toys on the front are not easy to use or very engaging.	-1
My daughter who is 17 months old, has every leap frog learning toy made.  I was so excited about this product...until I got it home.  My daughter had a very hard time understanding what to do.  She ended up pulling off the book and just pressing the pad.  The concept is great, but the actual toy isn't.	-1
I got this as a gift for our daughter when she was around 10 months old.  All the other reviews are right - the doors break off WAY TOO EASILY!  But our daughter really liked it, and for that one month, she used it as a walker to help her walk.  Now she uses it with her playhouse, and sticks all kinds of things into it.  She is now a year and a half and though it sits along the wall, she still uses it with her other toys. When her friends come over, they always want to play with it for 2-3 minutes, and then they move on. The other noise-makers on the walker keep little 1 year olds interested for a little while as well.  I think it was a great gift, but I would not have bought it. 2 stars for durability (due to the doors - they are still somewhere around the house).	-1
There are much cuter activity walkers out there on the market, but, they also cost more money, so you have to decide what is important for you in a walker.  Personally, my son only used the walker through his cruising to walking phase.  As soon as he became a confident walker the toy lost all interest.  I put it away in the "baby" things and was satisfied with the job it did helping him gain confidence in walking.  That being said, if you want a toy to leave out and have your child play wiht after he learns to walk, this is not the toy.  The mail slots come off way too easily and are boring.  The mail pieces always wind up lost in the sea of toys and parts in the house.  The accessory toys (bug themed) on the walker are way too hard to manipulate, plus never made much sense to me since the theme is a mailbox, what are the bugs doing on it?! You have to choose for yourself what you want in a walker and then go out and buy for those needs/wants.	-1
I bought this walker because it looked nice and sturdy for my 11-month-old, who cannot wait to walk on his own.  He rarely uses it as a walker though.  He's more interested in pulling the doors off the front of it, and on more than one occasion has used it as a climbing tool.  Once he even fell and split his lip open.  The doors on this thing should be attatched better, and barring that, the toy should be recalled.	-1
My husband and I bought this toy for my 8 month old daughter. We liked it because it was the only one on the market that had " cruise control" and we thought that would be important since we have hardwood floors. We spent almost an hour putting it together and then we let the little one try it out. At first she was so excited to play with the toys. But as soon as she opened the mail box and started to climb up. The the flap popped off and she fell on the front of the walker busting her lip. Needless to say it went back to the toy store and we bought the playzone activity walker. She likes the colors, sounds and sturdy craftsmanship better than the little tikes.	-1
This one is really annoying-aside from the fact that it is loud-it does next to nothing that it claims-save your time, money and the stress of you child saying "MOMMY THIS THING IS NOT WORKIN" RIGHT!!!"	-1
This was on the top on my daughters Christmas list. I think she has played with this for less than 5 minutes total since she received this on Christmas Eve. It doesn't come when you call it, just usually turns and goes in other direction. She almost started crying the first time she called it to come to her & it kept walking away from her. The constant barking is annoying. Go-Go spends most of her time turned off siting in a corner. It definitley is not worth the money! I do like the movement in general. It moves easily on carpet & doesn't fall/tip over the way other walking dogs do. Save your money!	-1
Our daughter asked for GoGo for quite a while. This Christmas we broke down & bought it. She loved it when she opened it. Once she found out exactly what it does [more like doesn't do] she completely lost interest.  It is a stuffed dog on wheels (legs don't move). The head moves, it pants/barks, & walks towards any loud noise.  That's it.  They advertise it as "trainable" and "reacts to your own voice" which is an overstatement!  It sits unattended as it has since Christmas morning and I can't say that I blame my daughter.  ZERO fun for $$! It was honestly a waste of money!	-1
Another toy that's just taking up space.  I have been looking for the prefect bath toy for a while and still haven't found it!  :(  My kids are 2 1/2 and 1 so maybe they are just too young, but I wish I could go back in time because I would not have ordered this.  I wasted money again!	-1
Cubs are covered with stickers and they are peeling off. Edges are sharp.	-1
I am returning this. In one day, my 11 month old daughter played with this and the plastic film started to come off. It's a shame because the product itself is very nice, the blocks are sturdy yet soft and easy to play with. The design is beautiful as well, bright colors and nicely packed. But the plastic film, and by that I mean the actual pictures started to peel off after a day. So I really can't get any use out of it.	-1
My two year old just throws the blocks around, this would be good for an older child, maybe 4 years old.	-1
I am so unhappy with this purchase, we received the blocks and they are so sharp they scratched me. The sticker on the blocks was already pealing and there was a scratch on some of the blocks. Do not buy this for your young ones, it is not safe. I basically feel like I should throw it away.	-1
This puzzle was a gift to my son and it turned out to be one of the crumbiest toys he has ever owned. The images peeled and scratched immediately and without any significant use or abuse, and the corners of the cubes are so ridiculously sharp I ended up taking the toy away. Melissa and Doug toys seem to be hit or miss on quality, but this one is seriously terrible and sharp enough to cause injury. Avoid this one.	-1
Sharp corners	-1
This is too hard for a toddler. I even had trouble with it. Also, as others have mentioned, the stickers aren't sturdy and will peel off eventually.	-1
I really wanted to love this... But I didn't. It is a cute concept but seems too difficult for younger kids who get bored and frustrated too quickly. The real cue to the puzzle is the border which took the kids a bit to grasp and then sort accordingly - all before trying to assemble the cute animal. We put it away and will try again when the kids are are older.	-1
We love green toy brand but they only have so much variety of toys and she loves the Melissa and Doug bead maze so we got her this puzzle block set for her birthday. What an abysmal disappointment. Yes they are stickers not painted and they are ripped and peeling within five minutes of play what a waste of money.	-1
another toy i thought my kids would love....	-1
There is nothing my three-year-old granddaughter loves more than a good puzzle.  She will do several puzzles in a row for an hour.  Since all her puzzles are labeled 'Ages 6 and up', I got this for her to do with her little sister.  We found it very frustrating to do, and by we, I mean the little ones, the seven-year-old, and the adults too!  The little sister didn't care about it, and her older, puzzle-adoring sister lost interest in just a few minutes.	-1
The pictures lift up,they should have made sure its put on better.	-1
If the design was painted, this would get 5 stars.  It is stickers that are not necessarily well placed and peels.	-1
We bought this for our two children who love puzzles but are at two different ages. Thought the younger could work on putting together the heads at the beginning, and the oldest would get the challenge of sorting and piecing together. Even if a little easy for her. But the first five minutes in use, and the stickers on the blocks are peeling off. I had to glue two or three of the stickers on the very first day.	-1
This is a cute set, but the pictures are not painted on to the blocks - they're just stickers....and after a while they started to peel.  I buy wood things because they last forever so I was pretty disappointed with these in the long run.	-1
These cubes appears to be made solid/wood. If your kid sits on his ass and this thing is on his back and if your kid happen to fall backward on these, the sharp edges could potentially hurt him. If its a grown up kid and if he picks up the habit of throwing stuff around (i bet they do sometime), these can hurt somebody. For kids it should be made softer with rounded edges, that was my thought.. by the way it is easy to make if you are a frequent visitor of home depot with untreated scrap wood!	-1
This is pretty hard for a kid.  I expect the actual age range for use to be 5-6.	-1
I am a bit disapointed that these blocks have had very little use and the stickers are already peeling off.	-1
We got a previous version of this set from a friend and one cube was missing somehow. My son really loves to play with it but cannot get the whole picture because of the missing part. He tries and tries to get it completed but cannot and is disappointed.  I contacted M & D customer service to buy replacement part but they answered they don't have any: "Our puzzles and toys are all completely packaged before they are shipped from our factory to our warehouse. For that reason, we don't have any extra parts or pieces in our inventory. " Which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't be a puzzle. Kids won't know what this learning toy is about with any missing pieces. Should I tell my son: look, this is a cow without a half head for example? Come on...  They just want us to buy the toys and if any of the parts would damage or missing we should throw out and buy a new set?!? How will I teach and raise my kid to value his toys and all of his stuff, don't waste and don't throw out stuff what can be repaired?!? The peeling-off stickers I can fix with some glue - although they shouldn't peel at all... but the missing piece should I also make and repaint etc by myself??? This is ridiculous. It is also possible to get replacement parts for a 3000 piece puzzle from an other manufacturer which takes care of their customers, wants to keep them and make them happy with the purchase.  You can imagine a little kid's face when you have to say he cannot use his toy anymore?!? I will not buy any of Melissa & Doug products in the future and will recommend my friends to do the same. I don't want to end up disappointing my son once again because of a not reliable manufacturer. Let me add, these toys prices are also not that low to replace the whole set because of a missing piece.	-1
i had to return this. the pictures were peeling before i even opened the package.  normally M&D products are exceptional, however not this one that i received.	-1
This product was great! That was until we tried to put together the pig. That was when we realized that we have some duplicate pictures on some of the blocks. That means no matter how hard my daughter tries she can never get the picture to look right. So buyer beware that you might only have a few animals that your child can put together correctly. We did compare the blocks to the picture just to confirm the block mistake. I had my wife double check the blocks just to make sure. I would have rated it 4 stars except the pictures don't all match up. I don't know how long the blocks would hold up because the pictures are just stickers. Thankfully we bought it through amazon and just returned it.	-1
Actually I bought it from a local store, but it's exacty this one. What crappy quality! My toddler enjoys playing other puzzles; but for this one, she focuses on peeling off the paper instead (because it's so cheaply pasted on).	-1
I had a puzzle like this when I was young.  SO much fun!  I had this in my hand.  I wanted to buy it so badly.  But as I looked through the shrink wrap I saw the pictures were peeling off the cubes.  I thought, OK bad puzzle.  But then I looked at ALL the puzzles they had at that store....they were ALL peeling.  Usually you can't beat Melissa and Doug quality but this time is not one of those times.  There has to be a better way to put the pictures onto the cubes.	-1
I was surprised to see a Melissa and Doug product to be made so cheap. The sticker peels very easy. Terrible desing and a waste of money.	-1
I just purchased this cube puzzle for my soon to be two year old daughter. I was so very excited to introduce my little one to one of my favorite types of puzzles as a little girl. I was even more eager because she seems to love puzzles as much as I did. As soon as we got home from the store we ran to open the package and play with it together. She abosolutely loved them! I was very happy for all of two minutes when I realized the stickers were peeling on almost half of the puzzle cubes. I don't understand how the Melissa & Doug Comapany let this product out to the public. It is terribly contructed. I am sending these back immediately and will be searching for a similar replacement of better quality. I was genuinely surprised at the disappointment from a company that usually provides high quality learning toys. I definitely suggest you pass on this toy...	-1
We have never used this outside - yet we have 2, or more, leaks that we can't seem to fix.  It came with one patch, but that didn't work...so we've got it covered with electrical tape, etc, yet air continues to leak out.  We inflate it before each use, which is loud and ridiculous, but our son loves to play on it.  It's also really big.	-1
