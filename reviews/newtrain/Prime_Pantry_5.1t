I purchased this Saran premium plastic wrap after trying Reynolds press and seal wrap which I would never use again.. There is less static cling to this wrap than I remember. To me this is a good thing because it doesn't stick to its self .  This is my typical complaint with all plastic wraps. When trying to cut them they ball all up and are useless. However they have improved this. Now Saran clings to the bowl or plate you wish to cover.  Now if only they could improve the cutters on the boxes so  that the cutters actually cut and scissors weren't required would be better..	1
I am an avid cook and baker.  Saran Premium Plastic Wrap is a staple in my pantry and the only plastic wrap I purchase.  I have tried other brands including Glad and have consistently found Saran Wrap to be far superior.  Saran Wrap is easy to use.  It's cutting bar cuts the wrap smoothly and the end of the wrap is easy to remove from the roll, doesn't get all sticky and impossible to remove like on some other brands.  Some of the comments mention that Saran Wrap does not cling, but I have never had this problem when using this wrap at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or in the microwave.  Keeps food stuffs fresh and wonderful to use to separate layers of freshly baked cookies and brownies stored in containers in the freezer.  I also use this to tightly wrap partially used fruits and vegetable like apples and avocadoes.  Saran Wrap excels at keeping these partially used fruits and vegetables fresh with no browning.  Another great Amazon Prime Pantry value.	1
Good wrap, keeping it in the fridge makes it easier to tear. Learned this trick from my sister.	1
I prefer Saran wrap over other brands. It doesn't cling as well to dishes, but it tangles less when pulling it out of the box.	1
Thanks	1
really good	1
Nice product, not a lot on the roll.	1
Great product.	1
When one can"t find the right lid, use this wrap.  It stays in place and keeps food fresh.  I use it to wrap sandwiches as well.  I will purchase it again.  Thanks for keeping it in stock/	1
good	1
Have been using saran wrap for many years. I prefer the 100 sq. ft. size since it is so easy to grab and hold when I need it.	1
Clings well and works like it should. The cutting edge isn't the best, but they never are on this style of box.	1
LOVE THIS SARAN WRAP	1
so far everything ordered has been as described and what I expected. Nothing has arrived undamaged or late. I will just repeat this message for each item. All has been great.	1
Sticks to bowls!  Love it!!!	1
perfect wrap	1
When I was a kid (a long time ago!), my mother would use Saran Wrap to wrap up left overs and cover plates and so on. Live and learn.  Now? I use it as well. It is wonderful for storing leftovers. It is useful for covering ingredients for my meals (mise en place?) to keep them fresh. It seemed to work well for my mother; it surely works well for me.  After all of these years. . . .  A satisfied customer!	1
It's not solid chunks. It's broken up like it would be before you mix it with mayo for tuna salad. But the taste is great.	1
Reorder all the time. Tiny bit salty, but for the price, I can live with that.	1
Great product, would definitely recommend to others.	1
Love the white tuna	1
Good tuna. mercury and all.	1
Very good pantry item for daughter who take lunch to work and often makes chicken salad.	1
love tuna!	1
Same tuna I've bought for years. Tasted weird and was very "liquid". Threw half of it away.	-1
I like the size for a quick lunch.	1
If you are looking to add fish to your diet, but sometimes find tuna to be a little too "fishy" then here is your solution.  Yes, it's still fish, but it's sort of like how white meat chicken is compared to dark meat chicken - a little drier and a little less deeper flavor. It makes it great if your family aren't a bunch of fish fans.	1
I mean... it's tuna.  It's better than other brands, I guess.	1
love it	1
AAA+	1
great tuna	1
Smelled and looked bad. Threw it out.	-1
Great deal for tons O' tuna. Tuna casserole is one of my 'go to' dinners when I'm in a rush. Also, this tuna makes excellent 'tuna cakes'. Great value and no dented cans.	1
love tuna fish	1

Love Tuna.  Mostly either in a sandwich or in a casserole.  Finished off a case, and will have to get a new one soon.	1
Very tasty. Not fishy at all. Love it as a sandwich with mayo	1
I always order my tuna from Amazon site. love this brand of tuna and good value on this product.	1
Good purchase.	1
I stock up on this product, have used for decades. Will continue to buy.	1
a+	1
Tuna quality is OK. Lowered sodium is a plus. Packed with an inordinate amount of water and therefore is wildly overpriced. Would not purchase again.	-1
Just the right size for a small portion of tuna salad to be made into a salad or sandwich.	1
Delicious!	1
...would buy again.	1
great item	1
tuna is tuna	1

This is nice to have on hand for my kids or me to make a quick sandwich. Lots of flavor for a lower priced tuna.	1
pricey	1
awesome product at an awesome price!	1
Grated with lots of water. Gave it to the cat.	-1
Yummy, great price & fast shipping!	1
It's like mush. I mean, it tastes like tuna but when I try to drain it it's just this mushy paste leaking out, and then It's a mushy paste that I'm eating. It's not a pleasant experience.	-1
High quality, great value.	1
ok	1
Its tuna people.  add on to pantry	1
Our cat loves it. We buy him tuna because it's cheaper than buying the really good canned cat food. Crazy right? But it is, and we'd rather give him tuna than processed meat and fish by-products. So, Simba says it's awesome. Your cat will too.	1
It's tuna, try it.	1
as expected	1
Tuna is almost Tuna. I'm checking out the contents & see how much MSG this product contains, but, for Tuna, It's Good!	1
good quality, good taste	1
can't go too wrong with tuna. limit this type for mercury, but otherwise.....it's tuna.	1
It's tuna fish. I like it. The only reason I am bothering to write a review for it is to get it off my order page.	1
Something has happened in the canned tuna industry. Cans that used to contain large almost white prices now contain as this can did, almost "mush" and all dark meat. Nothing "light" about the can we purchased.  Looks like some cannery scraped the bottom of the pan and all we got was those scrapings. On top of that the smell was like old fish. Very disappointing in our last can. We trust that all cans are not like that.	-1
Good tuna	1
What happened to Chicken of the Sea?  It used to be great tuna, with large chunks and great flavor.  Now it's tuna mush -- the texture is almost like a pate, with virtually no recognizable pieces of tuna. The flavor is bland as well.  Not happy with the change! Time to switch brands.	-1
I bought it against my better judgement and I'm glad I did, it's just as good as Bumble Bee's Albacore Tuna, but cheaper.	1
Chicken of the sea has  always has been my pick for tuna. They produce a great product. Great in chicken salad or in a pasta side dish. Arrived on time.	1
Yummy... I'll be buying more of this.	1
Very cheap. Great addition to a prime pantry box. A lot more economic than at the super market!	1
very good	1
I bought these for my husband. He likes tuna and he doesn't want to hassle with chunk tuna. He eats this right out of the can, on the run. He says the price is great. He buys a lot of his own groceries since he's on the road a lot. So these type of bargains, he loves	1

Great. Thanks!	1
Makes a great sandwich and/or casserole.	1
This Chicken of the Sea, Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water is good tasting tuna packed in water. My wife prefers the water packed over the oil packed and this was a good price.  Recommended!  CFH	1

I will give any kind of tuna in water a high rating. I love to eat tuna sandwiches.	1
Tastes and low in fat	1
Good to have around if you're into tuna salad.  I didn't eat it but my cat loved it.	1
Tuna yup i like Tuna	1
Starkist.	1
Great Item.	1
good stuff	1
great value	1
Taste good and has chunks and not all mush like some I've purchased in the past	1
Really difficult to drain since it is all blended with water instead of being chunks resting in water. Don't know, maybe the fish were twerking.	-1
I am not sure what to think here.  Many of the reviews are for the "Chunk Light" not the "Solid White Albacore" which is what I bought- and what I got.  That is the only option available, so I don't know why the verified purchases for light tuna are appearing here.  Additionally, some reviews are for the smaller pop top type cans that come in a multi-pack.  I quit buying chunk light tuna several years ago because of the decline to mushy texture and stronger fishy smell.  Full disclosure, I was buying Starkist, not Chicken of the Sea, but the Starkist chunk light tuna I grew up on had evolved into a product more like cat food than I cared to eat.  My only reason for trying this brand was BECAUSE it is labeled as Solid White Albacore, the price was better than my grocery store, and I had some room in my pantry box so this product popped up as a recommendation.  Had I come to the page and looked at the reviews or the photographs, I would absolutely positively passed on buying it.  The rusty cans shown at the top of the product page are disgusting.  It is not likely I will purchase this again even though the cans I received were fine and I couldn't really tell any difference from my usual brand.	1
Ordered a 4 pack of this tuna about a week ago.  Opened a can and nothing in it but mush and water.  Not one "chunk" of tuna in sight!  Wish I could give this tuna less than 1 star!	-1
Love to have Tuna on hand for a fast meal when my blood sugar says "Feed me, NOW!"	1
This tuna is really delicious. Albacore tuna is just so much better than even light tuna. It is packed in water so it's high in protein and low in calories. It has a great taste and can be used for sandwiches and in recipes. I love it! I have noticed that the pieces are smaller now and the chunks aren't as tightly packed. This last can looked a bit like cat food with more water than usual. The taste though is the same. Very flavorful and not too "fishy".	1
simple typical quality of tuna. fair price.	1
BEST TUNA	1
The best brand of tuna I've found so far!	1
Excellent	1
Not only are these cans super convenient, but our cats love little treats from them. Good tuna!	1

I am very please with the product.	1
great food item	1
I have never received a bad can of chicken of the sea tuna. In fact, we opened one the other night and had a delicious supper. The tuna was white and flaky and delicious. Now here is my recipe - cook enough rice for how many people are going to eat. Open one can of cream of mushroom soup or two cans if there are more people. Dump in a can or two of tuna into the soup and heat. Pour over the cooked rice. We think it is delicious. I use this tuna for casseroles, sandwiches, salad on top of tomatoes. That is yummy. It is my most favorite brand of tuna.	1
Perfectly good cans of tuna in water at a reasonable price through Prime Pantry.	1

I like to stock up and filling a pantry box is an excellent idea!	1
Product as described - Fast Shipping - Very Satisfied!!!	1
I suppose that for the price this is good tuna. Amazon's price was as cheap as my local store so I bought a few cans. The best thing I can say about it is, well, it's convenient and relatively inexpensive. Taste? What there is of it is mildly fishy. Not in a bad 'old' fishy way, just a bit fishy. It might be called Chicken of the Sea, but there is no mistaking it for anything but tuna fish from a can.  After getting the American tuna, this is pretty bad, but this is a fraction of the cost. My cans had an even mix of chunks and flakes. Better than the no name store brands. Another good thing is the long shelf life. It seems like the dates on tuna cans are always later than other canned goods like vegetables or soups.  If you really like tuna, the American one is a nice splurge once in a while, but this is an ok everyday tuna for casseroles and tuna melts.	1
I usually get albacore and was hesitant to try it but I bought it because of the price and it is actually very good tuna. I like this brand as well	1
Good tuna  good price 6 cans under $7.	1
The original, classic tuna taste - dolphin safe and low mercury. Zekk and me dig it!	1
We always keep this on hand. Easy to store and we mix it in just about everything to get our toddlers some protein.	1
bent cans.  you can't risk eating anything from a bent can, especially fish.  and it just made the list of tuna NOT to buy.	-1
Barely edible. I like tuna but I've smelled better tuna cat food!  Not solid white.  Grainy texture and too much water.  Chicken of the Sea used to be the best but not anymore. Very disappointed.	-1
edible but soupy.  not like it used to be.  like puree tuna.	1
Good deal	1
donated to food pantry, have to leave review so it leaves my list.	1
Great for tuna noodle casserole.	1
Most disgusting tuna I've ever seen. Can't be drained because the whole product is pure sludge. Should be taken off the market and shame on chicken of the sea, a brand I used to trust. There were no chunks at all so I had to pour the sludge into a fry pan and heat till the liquid evaporated out. Then I added mayo to make it tolerable. ( I hate throwing food away, so I try to make do when I can)	-1
great	1

This was good tuna, but it is not priced competitively, I would re order if I could not get out to shop. I do enjoy the convenience of delivery.	1

I love this and my cat does, too.  It's great for mixing with her food--or for making tuna salad for one.	1
Great tasting tuna, always fresh, great for salads & sandwiches.	1
I absolutely love prime pantry boxes...don't have time to shop and don't even like going out to do it anymore...have a home business that keeps me working to much...I shop for 5 to so it is a job in itself...PRIME Pantry is a more than fair price...just plan them right & it is wonderful...	1

good for you... omega 3 fish oil.	1
Very good!	1
I got these as a filler for pantry box.  The pricing is comparable and I already like this brand.	1
Great to have it brought to my house for same price as going to store.	1
Emergency Preparedness item. I don't want to be caught unprepared.	1
Another Prime Pantry item that satisfied the shopper in me. This item is of great quality and at the quantities I look for, Thanks Prime Pantry.	1
I order from Prime if I can find a comparable product to my grocery in terms of price and ratio in the Prime box (ie. does it fill too much of the box to make the order make sense vs. smaller items) and the ease of having dry foods come to the house directly instead of driving out into town (we are rural).  This item fits my criteria, and it came as it would from the store. Sometimes the boxes get dented because it will take a tumble around the UPS truck, but it's a box... the contents are fine.	1
TUNA  -- salad -- with crackers -- in a dip -- whatever it's good eatin'	1
This was a very bad idea, and should be considered that by ALL COMERS. Go with the fresh-bag approach. Have not received --ONE-- edible, or even slightly fresh can as of yet. Still searching for an even partially edible option, THIS IS NOT IT.	-1
I only use Solid White--even though it is said it has a little more mercury.  I try not to eat too much, though.	1
Great!	1
Who doesn't love tuna?	1
GREAT ON TOASTED WWBREAD AND TOMATO SOUP!	1
This was a great price at the time I bought it and one of my favorites. This tuna has a clean non fishy smell and does not leave any aftertaste. It is mild flavored tuna.	1
GREAT	1
Great snack, I love these with a little hot sauce for an afternoon snack	1
Best tuna that money can buy.	1
love solid white albacore tuna by Chicken of the sea.  I use it in tuna salads, casseroles and just plain.	1
Good price, fast delivery. Seems the can is smaller than it used to be.	1
Tuna good, some cans bent because I ordered thru pantry prime. Box packed without enough packing material.	1
Packed with tuna not just water like some generic brands. A little salty for me , perhaps due to my sodium intake very little, but very good!! No complaints.	1
I do not know what this is, but I do know it is not Tuna.  It tasted like water with mush in it.  Yuck!  I am a bumble bee tuna, white albacore fan.  However,  when they are out my brand, try others, including his brand. Well, whatever they put in this can, they should be ashamed of itself.  I will never purchase this again. Buyer beware...I would not feed this to my cat (I am serious).	-1
good	1
We like chicken of the sea as our favorite tuna but the cans are a little big but would still buy them again because sometimes we use more than 1 small can.	1
So glad Amazon Pantry carries this item. It's always found on my normal shopping list and now it's on my Amazon Pantry list. One of my favorites! For good health, we should always eat fish at least 3 times a week.	1
I trusted Amazon and Chicken of the Sea and never in my wildest imagination thought their tuna could almost cause my death...but IT ALMOST DID!  I started getting diarrhea and thought it was from a virus or mild flu until I lose  33 lbs. in little over 1 month.  Investigation led to the discovery of HEAVY AMOUNTS OF MICE DROPPINGS IN THE CANS...TO THE POINT, EVEN MY CAT WON'T EAT IT!  DO NOT BUY..AND IF YOU HAVE EATEN...GO DIRECTLY TO THE DOCTOR!!!!!!	-1
My granddaughter loves this Tuna. Makes a delicious tuna salad for a quick sandwich. Keep extra in the pantry for after school or work snack. Pour the juice in a dog bowl or cat bowl. The animals will appreciate the extra treat. Also a good snack before bed time.	1
This is a great price and what a deal. We love tuna salad in our house and this is just perfect for us. Don't be affraid of the size it's worth a try!!!! I will buy again and again!!!!	1
I'm the only one in the house that enjoys tuna fish so this product is perfect for me.  The easy open tab is a plus too!	1
Love it!	1
Having all these cans delivered so quickly to my door is a plus, and Chicken of the Sea is a great brand to buy. The taste is clean and fresh, and it's great plain with just a splash of lemon. Of course, it makes a super traditional tuna salad sandwhich. For us, the best use is in wraps with low-fat cheese and sprouts.  Fabulous stuff!	1
Tuna is really all the same unless you can find a good albacore or yellowfin tuna.  This Albacore tuna is a good tuna with no oil providing exactly what you need for salads and sandwiches.  Very consistent taste and quality in the six cans we received.  I can never find Chicken of the Seas premium tuna so Amazon.com becomes the right home for us on price and service.	1
I have always been a tomato soup lover, but sometimes I just want something a little different.  The addition of the basil still maintains the tomato flavor, but adds that little bit of a "kick".	1
This is my number one tomato soup for lunch. I love the taste of the Basil in the soup, and as a purist, I never add milk or cream! I have always had a bad reaction of heartburn after eating tomato soup, but I have never had a problem after this terrific lunch time treat. Give it a try; the basil is incredible. Also, I know it's hard to believe, but if you are looking for fiber, see the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Progresso-High-Fiber-Soup-Creamy-Tomato-Basil-19-Ounce-Cans-Pack-of-12/dp/B00434HMSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Progresso High Fiber Soup, Creamy Tomato Basil, 19-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.	1

Good tasting soup.	1
Love this soup.	1
Minestrone soup that tastes good.  I love Progresso soups, and this one fits the bill	1
It adds a little flare to a soup style known to be bland at times.	1
Good.	1
love it	1
My favorite tomato soup ever I like to add chili pepper flakes for a kick	1
This is the best tomato soup out there. Delicious. Ended up buying 6 more.	1
Packaged beautifully, delicious, healthy.	1
This soup is the greatest - much better than Campbell.  All of Progresso soups taste home-made.	1
Great value	1
This is weirdly hard to find in my current area and it's one of my favorite soups. Very nearly as good as homemade. Heartily recommended! And they don't go changing it every year, I hate that. This simple, classic recipe is the same as it's ever been, which is perfect because it needs no adjusting. You might wanna throw a little grated cheese on it, as one does with homemade pasta e fagioli, but it doesn't need any flavor doctoring, it's just right as is.	1
like grandmother used to make, without all the hours of work.  If you like lentil soup you'll probably like this.	1
Taste is awesome and can lose weight with this soup A+++	1
A STAPLE IN MY HOME	1
Good soup!	1
really good, very cost effective	1
loved this soup will buy again-thannk you!	1
This has for a long time now been our favorite tomato soup. For years, we ate the basic Campbells mixed with milk, and we thought it was great.  Then after I started trying some Progresso soups, we tried this out, and it was great. Now, sadly, the Campbell's tomato soup tastes strange. It just doesn't hold up anymore.  Happily, I've yet to find a Progresso soup that I don't like what I see in the nutrition label. The beat Campbells all to heck in that analysis too. I was loyal to Campbells for decades. Now I give me wife a sideways look if she slips up and buys anything but Progresso. LOIL	1
Grilled cheese and tomato soup has been a comfort Food for all of us for many years. We all know the red and white cans of soup, but they have lost their taste for me. Progress tomato with basil is the best tomato soup I have found. The taste can not be beat. I would stack up this soup against any other tomato soup.  Now all we need is the grilled cheese.  Recommended. prisrob 01-18-18	1
Good price on these	1
as expected	1
Husbands favorite...	1
Fast Delivery - Good Price - Who Could Ask for anything More	1
Tomato basil soup. Best tomato soup in a can.  I have been eating the other canned tomato soup,but this brand has a much better taste,because of the addition of  basil. Very nice comfort food,especially now that the weather is turning cold.	1
One of my favorites.	1
Good soup and received quickly.	1
real good	1
As expected	1
Yummy lentil soup. I add a hit of fish sauce and soy sauce to this with some of my homemade fermented jalapeno sauce to kick it up a notch. Even better with fresh chopped cilantro. A slice of fresh garlic bread and voila! Tummy iz sooooo happy!	1
This was a favorite of mine as a child.  But the price $26.84 6=$4.47 a can !  Wow, make a better price, then I'll be buying.	1
Really really yummy!	1
Delicious.	1
Think vegetarian grown up bean & bacon soup - yum	1
I'm not a soup eater BUT I love this soup. I eat it hot with crackers. Or I drink it cold as a between meal "pick up". I'm just about to order 3 more cans.	1
Great with Ritz crackers.	1
Convenient	1
Awesome	1
Tastes Great!	1
good	1
I add some unsalted chopped tomato pieces and a touch of half and half for an elegant lower-sodium soup which doesn't taste like it comes from a can.	1
Just add milk instead of water for a delightfully creamy tomato soup.	1
Fantastic it was delicious,	1
Excellent for using as a base for sauces or for poaching fish.	1
Good soup.  Large serving, no mixing. Yeah!	1
Delicious :)	1
I bought this because i like tomat soup. This has excellent flavor. The herbs and spices are just right. Nice chunks of tomato. I enhance it with a couple of shots of tabasco.	1
Thank you	1
We have only good things to say about this product ! It is delishous !!	1
The best minestrone soup that is cooked on a nation wide basis. It's chunky and the vegetables are cooked right. I love the taste also. I go through Progresso's Minestrone soup very fast.  I buy a case at a time. The soup isn't that heavy either. I'd think great for kids. I'm 70	1
Ok	1
Hearty	1
I love tomato soup but every time I go to the store I forget to get some. Then one day, bored, browsing on Amazon, I saw them and thought "huh, why not?" Now, I buy a bunch of stuff, including my fave soup, on Amazon. I love the convenience of having them bring it to my home and not having to thing about it when I'm at the store!!	1
This is a hard flavor to find. Can't seem to duplicate it, the sweetness.	1
Good product.	1
love	1
More like tomato sayce	1
This is a really delicious tomato soup and a really good price.  The consistency is nice too and is low in calories.	1
Great taste.	1
THE PEAS WERE HARD, BUT OTHERWISE, GOOD SOUP	1

Good soup.	1
It's a little on the sweet side, but overall I like it. Has a good 'mouth feel' to it, has a texture like homemade.	1
Great product!!! Highly recommended!!!	1
And again, Yummy! great soups!	1
Progresso vegetarian soups are absolutely delicious and extremely convenient. They have pop off tops so no CanOpener is needed. You can hit it in the microwave or the stovethis makes a nice meal for one person. Please do check prices as they tend to go up and down.	1
I live the flavor but, you can only eat about 1/4 of a serving because this is loaded with sodium.	-1
I got lucky enough to snag a great deal recently on Amazon, they had this deal for under $7 so I grabbed it! I put it on Subscribe & Save but unfortunately they jacked up the price big time so I cancelled my subscription. But oh how I love this soup. It's so hearty and good for you!! Sometimes you just want a nice big hot bowl of soup! Progresso is so good. I hope Amazon lowers the price again, if they do I will be getting in on it again!!	1
yummy	1
Good taste another winner by Progresso!	1
Lo cal and delicious  Good to have on hand	1
Excellent Product.	1
Yep.. It is food.	1
Uh, yum	1
thanks - good item	1
I hate that I am required to write something rather then just rating the product.  I can understand requirement if I give poor rating.	1
great price	1
I love lentil soup.  This is not as good as homemade but a close second.  Very tasty.	1
Wonderful flavor!  Thick and tasty.  You can actually see and know what each vegetable is in the bowl.  The can provides two servings (1 cup each) without the need to add water.  This is the only Minestrone soup I have found that consistently tastes great.  I highly recommend this soup.	1
Mama mia no one makes minestrone like Progresso. Fine at any time.	1
Wholesome and tasty.	1
Progressive makes so many wonderful soups. I especially like the Minestroe. Each spoonful has different flavors. Makes eating this soup fun. It contains no meat and this helps with cholesterol. I recommend this soup.	1
Ordering more.	1
THIS is a great can of soup for the house. Very filling and as a good substitute for a no-meat day ...	1
Very well packaged, prompt delivery, great taste..love Progresso!!!	1
great product from a great seller!!!	1
Chicken cutlets  taste great dipped in egg,the half flour half Progresso breadcrumbs.mmmmm the best	1
Great value!	1
I didn't realize how huge the containers were. Good bargain as a 3 pack.  We use often in salmon patties, meatballs, casseroles etc. so it won't go to waste.	1
this is the only brand I use.	1
This is great in my meatloaf and salsbury steak recipe :) came fresh and packaged good!	1
I purchased this in a group of many other things as a gift for a friend who needed some pantry items to feed a family of 5.  I am happy to report that these arrived in good shape and according to my friend, tasty!	1
This is a great way to buy Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs.  It saves a lot of money using Subscribe and Save and I know I'll never run out.  I've always found these bread crumbs very nicely seasoned and great used so many ways.  I add it to leftover mashed potatoes along with an egg and onion powder to make really yummy potato cakes.  I use it as a breading on baked chicken, fish, or pork.  I add it to the flour mixture I use when making fried zuchinni, and of coarse I use it when making meatloaf or salmon loaf.	1
Love these Italian flavored bread crumbs..they add so much to casseroles, meatloaf, or as a coating for fish or chops.  Glad to see Amazon offering these..a good value over buying them individually in the grocery store.	1
The taste is still great but it's not very creamy.. More watery these days!!! When I was younger it was creamy! Odd! Not amazon fault of course.. Like that in store too..	1
Yep it's sloppy Joe sauce. Tastes great.	1
Another old favorite. Good lunch with chips or good entre for dinner with a fresh salad.	1
good	1
I have no ideal how long Hunt's Manwich has been around however it seems forever as we have always had a can or town in the pantry. It is a great items to prepare quickly especially when kids drop in and want more than just a potato chip snack. Easy to prepare and the kids all seem to like it. It is also very inexpensive compared to heading out to a hamburger place to get burger for four of five kids. Guess we will continue top keep a  could of cans on hand at all times. Great item.	1
Great taste, easy to use and family loves it.	1
Another killer product Memphis is not as good on this price you are so fair	1
Ok	1
happy with quality and service	1
Great price for Manwich wheel of Manwich	1
Good taste	1
Very cheap and you can make a lot of sandwiches with it.	1
ok	1
Great Product	1
Good product	1
I love the convenience of the canned sloppy joe mix. The taste is a bit tart but can be easily tweaked. It goes great with both ground beef and ground turkey.	1
Easy to have to add to donation to food pantry	1
Great taste, use 1lbs of ground beef with mixture.  Making the whole meal to about 15 - 20 mins.	1
Makes the best sloppy joes.  Used many times.	1
Delivered on time and great for quick food.	1
Came dented had to throw away	-1
It`s good.	1
Good. If you like things a little bit less tart, just add a couple of squirts of catch-up to it.	1
Taste great	1
We love this sloppy Joe sauce. Makes a real good sandwich!!!!!	1
This is great a spaghetti sauce if you mix a can or 2 of Manwich with a jar of any spaghetti sauce.  It tastes like home made.	1
Tasty.	1
food	1
preservatives galore	1
Love the taste	1
I add a can to a pot of chili meat to keep it mild enough for me to enjoy..	1
for our stockpile	1
great product	1
As expected	1
PRICELESS	1
Quick n easy	1
Bought this for my niece who loves food. She ate it so it must be good.	1
Kids love it	1
Best sauce Ive found so far	1
Its OK	1
If you don't have time to make your own homemade sloppy joe sauce, then this is a very good choice.  If you like a little more just combine one can of this original sauce with one can of spicy and you'll have a slightly spicy sauce that the kids and adults will love.  Saute some sweet onions, bell peppers, celery, and minced garlic for a really good to excellent sloppy joe sauce.  This is an excellent base.	1
This been has ben around a long time. It is very flavorful makes quick and easy sandwiches. Or can be used in meat loaves. Still taste great after all these years. I like it with chicken or turkey.	1
Bought this on a whim and I am glad I did. It was good then and it is mighty tasty now too. Back on my home menu.	1
Bought to make manwiches when my grandkids come over. Easy quick meal that kids love. Great as sliders during the game season.	1
Good for quick meal	1
perfect for campingg	1
Arrived on time and exactly what I expected.	1
price was right and like the product. Works great for dinner in a pinch	1
useless, and tasteless. This stuff is just awful, really. This has got nothing to do with the MANWICH I grew up with in the sixties and seventies. This stuff is not sweet, or salty (even though its loaded with sodium) or even contain any flavor you might be familiar with. This stuff tasted like something prisoners would be served at Cook County Jail. Its pointless to buy, eat or serve. Its needs so much doctoring to be edible, you might as well just cook. a Can of tomato paste and a onion will get you miles of flavor past this dreck. Just awful, don't bother......	-1
What a joke, this is just watered down tomato paste, manwich my ass,  you have to add everything, and it tastes like left over spegethetti,  don't waste you money on this junk,  Ugh.	-1
Use this lots.	1
LOVE MANWICH	1
TY pantry for helping me help others	1
Great! Thanks!	1
A staple.	1
If you don't like sloppy joes...	1
These are great tasting and very fresh.  Fantastic purchase and will be buying again	1
Its more than a sandwich...its a meal. You all know what this is..It is nostalgia in a can.	1
All okay - No Issues.	1
heat and bread!	1
I didn't like it, maybe you do ( your stomach has to be stronger than mine)	-1
You can't beat Manwich for a quick meal.  Dinner or lunch in 10 minutes or less.	1
We've been enjoying this easy mix for ground hamburger for years although I was disturbed to see corn syrup listed as one of the first ingredients.  It won't stop us from eating it but less often because of this harmful ingredient.  Corn syrup has been shown to increase the risk of type 2 diabetis and also is harmful to the lining of arteries.	1
Kids love to cook this for dinner.	1
thank you	1
Tastes great.  Easy dinner	1
Just what I was expecting	1
it is sweet, it has a lot of sugar in it.	-1
Love it with ground beef	1
yum	1
Good value.	1
FOR MY SON	1
great value item	1
A kid favorite at our home.  My kids like spongebob squarepants.  Until I presented these as craddy paddies they weren't touched.  Now they are gobbled up.  Kids?!?!	1
Decided to try this again! and it is still GREAT!! Best of all it taste good and very easy to fix !	1
WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT	1
Made very good sloppy joes	1
Manwich Original is my 'secret' ingredient in chili's, Italian dishes and Brunswick Stew! I've tried cheaper brands, or just different brands, but none come close to this sweet, tangy, tomato'y rich flavor. Yum! Try it!	1
yum	1
Delicious as always!	1
Great I have been making chili from scratch but I was going to make manwiches for the kids I read the chili receipe followed it . It was easy they said the chili ws goos Thank you Hunts	1
Very good!	1
Cheap dinner! Heat, plop on a bun and open mouth! Add onions for a little extra flavor.	1
We like Manwich for a quick "already made" dinner.	1
easy meal right here	1
Classic Manwich and ground beef, can't go wrong for an easy quick dinner.	1
Yucky, ruined otherwise good ground beef	-1
I told hubby we could make our own.	-1
great	1
very nice.	1
Who doesn't love Sloppy Joes?	1
Good taste	1
For a quick way to make Sloppy Joe's this is the way to go.  I do not any of the other brands out there and most of the time do not have the time or desire to make Sloppy Joe's from scratch.  I love Sloppy Joe on burger buns.  If you never tried Sloppy Joe's but enjoy Chili I think you would enjoy eating this product.  It is easy to do brown your ground beef, drain off grease and than put in the can of sloppy Joe and let simmer.  Easy to use product and tastes the same as it has for many years. Now I am craving some.	1
This makes great sandwhiches	1
Great	1
I love manwich and it is great with ground turkey! It says to use one can with only 3/4 lb of ground turkey, but I made it with 1.25 lbs of ground turkey and it turned out great!	1
great	1
under $1.  Wow!	1
great products , so convenient, right to my door! I am not crazy about shipping charges, but convenient is key right now!	1
good	1
Fast shipping and great product!	1
I've tried all the other brands and have even made my own sloppy joe mix when my kids were little - NOTHING tastes as great as Manwich! I always keep a couple cans on hand!	1
Great price.  Nice and easy for a quick dinner.	1
A gift	-1
For when I'm feeling lazy and happen to have hamburger buns in bread drawer. Kids love it with cheese on top.	1
Good buy	1
Family likes....makes a good quick meal	1
We really enjoyed Manwiches for dinner,  Had forgotten how much we liked.  Arrival on time, packaging great!  Thank you	1
Yummy	1
Great product	1
Good quick tasty lunch.	1
A hearty meal especially on a cold night when your not sure what you want.	1
when it's time to go to choir practice or you have to go for the PTA meeting isn't it great to have a can of man which in your cabinet so you can make a sweet quick dinner with ground beef and  manwich sauce on  top of the hamburger  bun.	1
GREAT BUY	1
ok	1
good price!  What more can I say..... It's Manwhich!	1
Great price great taste great deal fast delivery awesome! One came out of four was dented though.	1
Love this for a quick dinners	1
it's meat and sauce, in a can	1
good	1
So good! Way better than the powder package stuff.  Sloppy joes are the best thing ever!	1
very easy dinner idea, we stock these for the times we're rushed for a meal	1
NOT BAD	1
Taste's good.  Nice for a quick dinner or supper.	1
Good stuff.	1
The taste is pretty basic for a sloppy joe.  Would I buy it again?  Maybe for the right price.  If you want a cheap meal, buy this to spice up your ground beef.	1
The original is still far superior to the wannabees out there.	1
my favorite sandwich filler. Love it and thanks	1
It's a good product but I amp it up by throwing in some hop peppers!	1
Manwich is more or less comfort food to me. 30+ years ago I use to make these for my finicky kids. It was always something that would eat without fighting with them.	1
every one loves Manwich	1
It doesn't seem to taste the same as it did when I was a kit, but it's still pretty good. It's really easy to make.	1
Easy peasy sloppy joes.  Don't follow the directions, one can is easily enough for 2 pounds of meat and using one can to 1 pound leaves you with a ton of sauce.	1
Although, I add onions, peppers and my own seasonings, Manwich would be good even without the extra step I take.	1
Great taste	1
Quick and easy meal.	1
Excellent product!	1
This is the only sloppy joe that my family has ever enjoyed.  It is very flavorful.	1
Loved it.	1
Purchased often	1
May not be the healthiest for you but tastes good. If you want to eat sloppy joes this is the easiest way to do it! This brand is pretty well known	1
Everyone love manwich sloppy joes. Delicious	1
Growing up I never had Manwich Sloppy Joe, but my husband had grown up on them. One day after we started dating he wanted Manwich sloppy joe sandwiches so we bought a can, added it to some hamburger and ate. I like the Manwich sloppy Joe and we now have this many times a year especially when we need a quick meal.  We now make the Manwich with ground turkey so that it will have less fat, with all of the spices in the Manwich the sandwiches taste just as good even when using turkey.	1
It was okay and something different.  Not something I would eat a lot of though.  Quick and easy if you need a fast meal though.	1
Thanks	1
LOVE THE PANTRY!	1
The "Hunt's Manwich Sloppy Joe Sauce, Original, 15 Oz" makes really great Sloppy Joe's and is super-delicious! We recommend this product to any and all! Well done goes to "Hunt's" for such a really delicious product! Thank you goes to our very Trustworthy Amazon.com, "Prime Pantry" for such a wonderfully delicious product at an unbeaten price-point!	1
Excellent product and a good price.  If you have not tried "prime pantry" yet, you are missing out.  Not only is there a great selection of products, it actually saves you money by keeping you focused on your shopping list and prioritizing the items.  One of the biggest expenses for my family is buying as many item on impulse as we do our shopping list.  Prime pantry removes the temptation of buying items, buy color, packing, or other sales gimmicks.  It also has a very cool calculator that tells you exactly how much room is left in your pantry box, and makes excellent suggestions for what to fill it with.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  How can you beat grocery shopping from home on your computer?	1
Well if you're reading a review about Manwich and never had any before, I'm so sorry that you've been missing out on life. Easy, simple and something that everyone will love for lunch, supper...heck maybe even a snack!	1
So easy to use and tastes great!	1
GREAT Purchase!	1
Good product & transaction.	1
one came a little beat up, but as described and amazon replaced beat up can.	1
Great product offered at a great price through Amazon!	1
Great for quick family meals.	1
Love my Manwich- easy, tasty and inexpensive.	1
Great for a quick, filling meal, when you're in a hurry.	1
Yum	1
This stuff scares me.  Like... wtf is this?!  But my hubs says it reminds him of his childhood, and I try to keep the guy happy.  So i buy it.	1
This stuff is so yummy	1
Got it great product	1
Great product. Love having the things I want delivered to my door.	1
Love us some manwich.  The funniest part of this is we ordered it as a quick meal for our exchange student to try.  He had never even heard of it.  We haven't made it yet but I can say without a doubt that when it comes to manwiches I can not even consider purchasing a no name brand.  I have to say that I highly recommend this product!  I will be ordering from prime pantry again as well. It has comparable pricing and great coupon opportunities and I don't have to go to the store!	1
I bought this sauce as part of a gift box I bought through Amazon for a needy couple. They genuinely appreciated it.	1
good	1
yum	1
As advertized.  Great. Thanks!!	1
My favorite Sloppy Joe mix at a great price!	1
The original Manwich is perfect for a quick dinner. Serve on a bun with some cheese or over noodles. I like to add any that's left-over, to spaghetti sauce and make spaghetti the next night. This is a family favorite!	1
makes a great sandwich	1
Store quality, great value delivered to your door - thank you amazon!	1
Love	1
As a bachelor living alone, this stuff makes a pretty hearty and quick meal...and that's the way us bachelors like it.	1
such a fast meal to make and always delish on your favorite bun...tried others, but no one can beat this flavorful Hunt product...el fed	1
Good for something quick and with ground chicken or turkey makes a good meal	1
Great	1
Just disgusting. This is not what I remember eating as a kid. My Mom must have jazzed it up or bought something else, I'll have to ask her. This sloppy joe sauce is extremely bland and has a weird sweet flavor. I added my own green peppers and onions and it did nothing to help it. I can't believe people actually like this product.	-1
tatses yummy	1
as expected	1
great product	1
Super fast meal when you need one. I always have some in the pantry. It is tasty and everybody in the house likes it.	1
It was exactly what I wanted and came quickly!	1
Easiest hot meal ever to use with ground beef. Tastes good.	1
Value priced!  Good product for a quick dinner!	1
Great items great shipping!!!	1
Juicy	1
pears...	1
Really liked them, no hard ones, just all perfectly ripened and no dented cans. Good snack and to use in cereal.	1
They were very good	1
Good	1
I go to the store and want some pears, all they have are the rock hard pears, I take them home and hope they will ripen in a day or two and then in the two and half days they're rotten. I like the Del Monte Pears, ripe without any chance of going bad before you open the can and to top it off not swimming in a lot of sugar.	1
Good product.	1
Mu husband loved this so much, he pigged out on the pears.  I was angry with him, he did not share, lol!	1
Great little treat with cottage cheese, or lightly dusted with cinnamon.	1
Always a consistent flavor.  Never disappoints.	1
taste good	1
A good item to keep on hand in your pantry for hungry boyfriends, husbands, and boys! But wait....women and girls like this too! It's a good base and you can enhance it  by adding the tomatoes ,onions, grated cheese and seasonings of your choice!  Make this item YOUR OWN by adding those things that satisfy your taste buds!  This is good any time of the year. I have to stop now...I'm getting  hungry writing this review  and I'll grate some Country White Cheddar Cheese onto this when I put it onto a toasted Onion Roll.  The delicious White Country Cheddar Cheese is available here. at Amazon, from the Wisconsin Cheeseman and is worth serving with a Man which!  Yummmmmm!	1
great deal	1
Donated to Arms Outstretched Ministry for military families in need.	1
Just too sweet, too much sugar and I don't like it.	-1
I am very please with the product.	1
This product is very good	1
manwich always good!!	1
good	1
delicious	1
Very hearty.  Not overly spicy.	1
Very good taste and not mushy like some other canned fruit I've tried.	1
I just love these pears, so good and refreshing.	1
Have you found what I have found. That canned fruit prices have sky rocketed in the past couple of years. The cost of a quality can of fruit is rapidly reached the $2.00 per can mark. We love canned fruit especially when we make a cottage cheese plate and these pears are excellent as are the peaches. Today I found an array of Del Monte fruits on sale for $1.00 a can and quickly purchased  several as they have an expiration date of July 2016. They will all be gone by that date. These are an excellent last minute dessert items and preparation is  a snap, just open the can and serve. You might want to place them in the frig for about an hour to cool down.	1
We love our pears	1
Item was just as expected at a great price. Received in excellent condition, and just as promised.	1
We can obviously purchase this elsewhere, but we have been enjoying the ease of Prime, especially as the weather gets cooler.  The price is comparable if you weigh in the cost of gas and distance, particularly if you live a ways out from town.	1
DELICIOUS	1
These are very good and make a great light after dinner snack!! The taste is great and the syrup is light.. Not thick and too much! Nice pull tabs so can take camping makes it very convenient!	1
it just easier to buy can fruits sometime  have them when you want  but the sugar is still high	1
Great price	1
Good deal	1
Nice for a quick dinner meal.	1
Same product I buy in the supermarket	1
cool	1
As Expected, as Promised, All is good with this Seller!	1
Like Manwich, but have noticed over the years the thickness has become less and ingredients have become scarce.	1
Flavorful	1
Had to restock.....	1
when you have grandchildren, you have this somewhere. Personally, I prefer from scratch but the 4 Muggs want this and so we have fun cooking it together, filling the buns and then watch everybody trying to eat it without sloppy--we all laugh and clean up together. That is worth it.	1
extremely dented cans sent. would not recommend on that fact alone.	-1
It's cheap, yes, but tastes to Ketchup. It doesn't come with meat. Doesn't taste good for tomato sauce, nor pizza. I guess it is meant to put together with baked chopped meat.	-1
My favourite green beans are French cut or "julienne" style green beans so I have  no trouble with the product as such, however out  of the 8 cans I bout 5 were dented, not slightly either, Not crushed exactly but obviously dented. I was the last ones available so maybe I got the dented ones. Anyway. Not happy with that. Expiration date  is July 15, 2015. That's OK but I doubt the dented cans will last that long and still be good. Dunno, so I'll eat them sooner than later. Sorry this isn't a good report but the dented cans were really awful..and more that half the order. A big fat one star for this one.	-1
Dented	-1
Too much of a chemical taste.  I know, it's artificial plavors, but some chips do a better job of tasting less like chemicals ...  this one doesn't.	-1
Vinegar flavor is too strong for us. We didn't enjoy them. Fresh and crunchy. Liked bbq and regular sea salt flavors very much!	-1
The packaging was okay but the contents were in crumbles.	-1
All the cans arrived dented, and some were open. The liquid ruined other dry products in the box.	-1
AWFUL KOCH BROTHERS PRODUCT ALL NESTLE PRODUCTS SUCK	-1
this is super small.. I will not order food again..everything seems like a sample size. Store has BIG Q Oats for 2.88.	-1
just didn't really have any flavor	-1
Not that Hot	-1
Poor	-1
I love the concept of these chips, but they go a little nuts with the pepper. I like pepper, but not when there's so much on something that I choke!	-1
I should have checked the size against the oatmeal I usually buy at the grocery store. I buy the large, this one is small.	-1
Won't buy again until free of even traces of Roundup.	-1
Not impressed. I like Kettle Brand chips, but I did not dig this flavor. They tasted kind of bland.	-1
they came crumbled and i received credit for it...would not buy again via internet as they were not edible	-1
These aren't that spicy or salty.  The chip is a nice kettle chip but otherwise, ok.	-1
They must be selling unsold products, it hurt to eat these chips	-1
Too salty and sour, not my taste...	-1
Arrived crushed.	-1
never tried kettle chips before and I have to say, not really as great as I imagined. not anything special and cost a bit much compared to normal potato chips.	-1
I like their taste but i find i have to suck on them so they soften before i can chew.  They are incredibly hard  I would recommend their standard plain sea salt version because those are a lot thiner and much easier to chew.	-1
Not that good	-1
A little too sweet for me	-1
This tuna salad mix they've got going on is pretty nasty. It's kinda sour and tangy like it has fruit in it or something. I think it may be the tomatoes. If you hate tomatoes definitely don't get these!	-1
Don't even, it's not worth it.	-1
Taste olds	-1
gross	-1
I'm not much of a fan of excessive goo in my food. This cheesy tuna melt blend is a bit heavier on the sauce than what I would incorporate into a tuna snack.  This snack kit comes with a package of six crackers, one 2.75 ounce can of cheesy tuna melt flavored tuna mix, sealed with an easy-to-remove, tabbed, foil lid, and a little flat plastic spoon-shaped thing to spread the snack.  The flavor is thick, beyond my own liking. The snack pack satisfies hunger for a little bit. I almost wanted to rate it three stars, as being "alright," but considering I have no desire to have another, I suppose a two-star "I don't like it" is in order for my particualr review.  As a portable snack, Bumble Bee Snack On The Run is an exceptionally convenient option, having everything needed to enjoy the snack while on the go included.  This is for people who find a saucey tuna snack appealing. I tend to like my tuna blends to balance out at the point at which the tuna is incorporated just enough that it is not dry.	-1
Very watery - not a good product	-1
really gross	-1
I didn't like it because it tasted fake and it seems I'm eating lots of chemicals. I prefer making the jello you buy from the box.	-1
Although they were edible, we did not like these at all. I'd stick to canned, refrigerated, or fresh fruit.	-1
what i don't understand how i can get chips to my house in one piece but not fruit cups. i had fruit all over the outside of the box, juices and fruit inside the box. i could figure out how to sent it back so i threw it away.	-1
Tasted awful. Were mushy.	-1
These are not peaches. They are from china.  They do not taste like peaches.  They are hard.  When peaches are in their own juices they become softer, I now, my mom use to can them.  I have order several of the Dole fruit cups and now I wish I had not.  So far, 3 of 3, are not the fruit labeled.	-1
Didn't like the acidy taste. Won't order again.	-1
I bought this to fill up my prime panty box. Half of them tasted alright (it's canned fruit, kind of what I expected) but the other half resembled pureed fruit, as opposed to diced as it stated and tasted off. I wouldn't buy these again.	-1
Part of several Prime Pantry orders.  Opened first peach bowl.  Tasted good, BUT!  Diced peaches were mush.  Disgusting!  I drank the bowl which was all liquid.  The diced peaches looked okay but were slimy nothings.  I will drink the others.  Because of bad experiences with poor Prime Pantry box packing I have cancelled Prime.  $99 per year and $5.99 per pantry box is a rip-off.  Nothing in it for me.	-1
They were just mush in a packet.	-1
I pored the noodles out in a bowl to see if there was any grain bugs because I experienced finding bugs in kraft Mac also. there they were all of over the noodles. It was the most disgusting thing Ive seen. Does the factory workers do this on purpose? Do they add these for freshness? Or is their factory just have VERY bad cleaning issues?  I am never buying Mac and cheese in box EVER AGAIN, making homemade is better anyway.	-1
Not very cheesy flavored.	-1
well i didn't notice it was organic hippy food at time of purchase and i ate normal mac and cheese like the day before .... did not compare wouldnt buy again but then again not something i would normally buy take my review lightly	-1
Pretend you are walking through a cow pasture and you see Annie's product on the ground. What would you do? Step in it? or Step around it? That is right, anyone in his or her right mind would step around the product found on the ground. This stuff is poop. It is not food but the excrement of a small industrial, moronic outfit. A stronger word than poop is merited for Annie's products. But this is a family page. Just as lousy as this stuff is an another Annie's product, the quick macaroni side dishes, prepare and eat in and from one container. So far my experience with this manufacture's products has me sounding the warning to all: AVOID.	-1
This have no taste. Yuck	-1
These were all melted together but I tore pieces off and used them in hot cocoa. Still a sticky mess. Bummer.	-1
This was an AMAZON FRESH purchase and should be exempt from reviews.	-1
Avoid the excess sugars and flatulence by avoiding this can of "food".	-1
I love marshmellows, except when they taste like dryer sheets! SOOOOOO GROSSSSS!!!!!! Don't order with any scented products, they SUPER absorb the scents/chemicals!	-1
I was so excited to get these but when they arrived I was really disappointed.  I tasted them and they were stale, dry, and crumbly.  The expiration date was January of 2018 but this batch was not good.  They didn't have an almond butter taste either...  Returned for a refund and not ordering these again.	-1
These seem to always have a problem. First it was cookies arriving after or very near the experartion date. Now they are poorly formed, crumbly and broken. I give up!	-1
Absolutely horrible.  They taste like someone placed oatmeal, and chocolate chunks in a bowl, soaked them in water, put them in a cookie press and then let them dry out.  Flat tasting and dry and way too thick.  This is the second Kashi item that I have bought and it tasted terrible.  I would not serve these to a dog.  A big waste of money.  I really can't believe companies are actually selling this crap.	-1
these are extremely dry, flavorless and too thick.  i will not buy them again. i am sorry i wasted my money on these. i do not recommend any kashi cookies. they are the worst i have ever tasted.	-1
very dry, flavorless and thick. not what i expected. i will not purchase these again. i will throw them outside. maybe wild animals will like them.	-1
I purchased Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax at the natural foods store located less than one mile from my house.  Opening the package immediately upon arriving home, I found not eight cookies, but a container of small crumbled pieces.  The contents of the package could have been a granola-style cereal had they not been labeled cookies.  Although I expected the Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax to be individually wrapped, they were not.  Instead they were held in a two-space, divided plastic container that was enclosed in a wrapping similar to that used for candy bars.  Because Kashi products are low in fat and have few ingredients that bind the others together, they do not remain intact during shipping.  I ended up using the crumbled Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax as cereal.  The cookies were tasty, but very dry.  Due to their fragile nature, I will not be purchasing the product again.  I would not recommend purchasing this product for delivery.  These cookies are five-star tasty, but only if you like crumbs.	-1
I have bought these cookies numerous times but will never buy another Kashi product again. Those ..... downsized the cookies significantly but left the box the same size! When I opened the box there was 3 inches of empty space. That is correct the cookies tray was now 3 inches shorter than the previous version and the cookies were a lot smaller. This is really unscrupulous to me, they are trying to make you think you are buying the same product but then when you get home and open the box, you get about 2/3 or less of what you used to get.  I am now wondering what else Kashi is lying about, probably about everything. To me Kashi is a very disreputable company for doing this and I will never buy another Kashi product.  I contacted Kashi about this issue more than once and their attitude said a lot about this company. They expressed No remorse, No regrets, No apologies and No consideration. They acted surprised by my concerns. It was obvious they care nothing about their customers, their reputation or losing customers.	-1

I am now wondering what else Kashi is lying about, probably about everything. To me Kashi is a very disreputable company for doing this and I will never buy another Kashi product.  I contacted Kashi about this issue more than once and their attitude said a lot about this company. They expressed No remorse, No regrets, No apologies and No consideration. They acted surprised by my concerns. It was obvious they care nothing about their customers, their reputation or losing customers.	-1

Eww	-1
The rice takes forever to prepare, and the bag of the spice that you're supposed to mix, contains too little of that mix, it was barely enough gor the amount of rice, and the rice tasted tasteless. I had to add a lot of my own spices, so what's the point ? I can easily make a better rice than this, with spices I buy at the store. Don't waste your money !!	-1
I like being able to order online for my food storage, however when boxes are dented and compressed, it doesn't work for food storage.	-1
Pasta good, packaging horrible	-1
This isn't a bad tasting wild rice blend but it is certainly nothing special. In fact, its flavoring, is quite subtle. The blend has a lot of salt, MSG, etc and can turn out somewhat watery unless you make adjustments.  What I found most annoying was the relatively long prep time. First, you really need a LARGE skillet WITH a cover. No - you should not use a pot. Rice-A-Roni specifies a large skillet WITH COVER and for good reason. They want you to brown the rice and that takes a skillet. Then the skillet must be covered. That may or may not be the type of cookware you own.  INSTRUCTIONS: First you must get your skillet up to heat and then brown the rice for about 3 minutes using butter or margarine. You can't walk away from this step - it requires constant stirring. Next: add water, the flavor packet and bring it to a full boil. Finally put a cover over your skillet and reduce the heat to a simmer and wait about 20 minutes while you simmer it COVERED.  The result, at this point, was a rather watery mixture that required even more simmering (uncovered) for yet another 4 minutes. The final result was a rather bland wild rice mixture, heavily laden with salt and a bit of the typical burn of MSG.  In the end, this wasn't a terrible blend - rather tasteless but hardly worth the effort.  Using far less effort, I can purchase the equivalent Lipton/Knorr rice mixture - throw it in a pot and I'm done in about 6 minutes.  I find it difficult to recommend this product.	-1
Wouldn't order again	-1
Not a fan at all.... Thought this was going to be very tasty but hey if you like the taste of cardboard then go for it! Very easy to cook sure but I thought it was going to be rich in flavor but it was very bland and made me feel nauseous and grossed out. I added some garlic and seasoning and it made the cardboard taste seem a little bit more bearable. Other then that look into other brands.	-1
I bought one of these from p. pantry to get free shipping and since the fettuccine was so good, I thought I would try it. It was not good at all. Also, bring back the Romanoff, it was very popular.	-1
The pasta is find, but the mix is not that tasty and there's very little of it. I had to use two packages of the mix on one meal of pasta, just to get my taste buds working. Not worth it !	-1
Lacking in flavor and consistency - watery and rather tasteless.	-1
I buy this once or twice a year just to have something different. This stuff tastes like I imagine dog food does, every time.	-1
I ate this and still have no idea what it is. My stomach felt weird for a few minutes after I ate it, but it wasn't painful and I didn't die, so I guess two stars is appropriate. Warning: It basically looks like you are cooking dog food.	-1
good but careful ordering, came exploded in box	-1
Vile taste...nothing like pineapple should taste...	-1
pretty much flavorless	-1
Can dented.	-1
Some of the stew cans were old with green mold which apparently exploded during shipment covering the other  items and the box with the green mold and contents.  This was shipped to my brother in college and he apparently thought one item was ok and got a bad case of food poisoning, vomiting for a week, We had to discard the shipment.  Obviously, the stew was too old and should not have been shipped in the first place.	-1
i ordered six of these and a bunch more stuff one of them broke open and got on everything i ordered  what a mess it was , luckily it must of not been to long because i was able to clean everything els that i had ordered .......	-1
First can I ate, became nauseous.  Ate another can last night.  Became extremely sick to my stomach. Details are too gory to relate.  Not happy with this product.  That being said - I have purchased this same product from my local grocery store and there was no problem.	-1
Well, this was weird.	-1
Dented	-1
Does not taste natural and if 3 or 4 pieces of Clam make it Clam chowder, well, OK.  The cream sauce seems to be made out of something else.  The potatoes are the only decent part of this soup.	-1

Clam chowder has been one of my grandmother's favorite soups for years. So I purchased this as a surprise. Progresso was a complete fail with her. Upon opening the can she noticed there were very little clams. Upon her eating one she discovered this was a good thing as the were so tough and chewy they couldn't be eaten. She was very disappointed. Will never by this brand again!	-1
I definitely won't be buying Dole Fruit Bowls again.  The pineapple has a distinct cooked and stale odor.  The juice at the bottom was cloudy and sticky.  No fresh flavor to be found here.  Time to go buy a fresh pineapple!!	-1
The juice is nice,the bruit forgettable.	-1
wayyyy too sour	-1
Received all cans dented, we're dented BEFORE shipping since the box wasn't dented or other contents disrupted.	-1
dented can	-1
I always buy Dole Pineapple in the can, but I won't buy these again.  Dole doesn't cut the core of the pineapple off of the ends.  It's like trying to chew straw,  The peaches are good.	-1
These cups cannot be opened without the juice squirting out on your clothes or table. So what I do is poke a small hole in the top, suck some of the juice out with a straw and the pull off the lid. The contents are  great, but getting to it is a drag.	-1
Clam chowder is one of my favorite foods and I have no qualms about calling Progresso a bad clam chowder. It doesn't taste good because it's made from cheap stuff. The taste is pasty rather than rich and savory. When I make my own clam chowder, I use flour and a considerable amount of butter and milk or cream, not soybean oil. Notice in the ingredients list below that cream and butter is less than 1% of this product, which is why this product tastes chalky and bland. It's got the right color, but the wrong taste. The texture is monotonous because it's just the diced potatoes in here that I can taste. Some celery pieces would've given the soup some textural variety. The clam pieces are very few and I don't taste them at all. I don't taste any of the other seafood powder flavorings, so I wonder why Progresso even bothered with them. There's also artificial color in here (white?) and DATEM, which is an emulsifier (keeps the oil from separating out).  Ingredients: Clam Broth, Potatoes, Clams, Soybean Oil, Water, Modified Food Starch, Onions. Contains Less than 1% of: Soy Protein Concentrate, Sugar, Salt, Cream, Butter, Sodium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Artificial Color, DATEM, Lobster Powder, Natural Flavor, Shrimp, Crab Powder, Parsley (Dried), Celery (Dried), Fish Powder, Tuna Extract, Spice, Yeast Extract, Corn Protein (Hydrolyzed), Whey.  1 can is 2 servings. Each serving is 180 calories (80 from fat) and 890 mg of sodium (37% of your daily intake). Who eats just half a can of soup?  Walgreens consistently has this on sale for about half the price, so there's no reason to order it from here unless you cannot find this locally and are desperate for bad clam chowder in a can. It's basically just a bland, can of diced potatoes in a white starchy goo, so I don't recommend it at all. There's very little nutrition in here (1g fiber, calcium 2%, iron 4%) and it's mostly just empty calories. It's edible, but I won't ever buy this again.	-1
Not great, but I like progresso soups	-1
Not very tasty	-1
I was hungry again in like a half hour. Very low nutritional content and calories.	-1
This soup was extremely salty tasting, so I checked the label.  I wish I had checked the label first!  1380mg of sodium in one meal, if you eat a can of soup for a main meal of the day like I do.  The American Heart Association recommends that the average adult have a sodium intake of 1500mg per DAY, and have no more than 2300mg at the most.  I won't be buying this stuff again, that's for sure!	-1
New England clam chowder is mostly potatoes with a few clams at the bottom. These are big cans of soup, but the flavor is bland, not creamy. I would prefer smaller cans with more flavor for the same price.	-1
Okay, this totally personal preference, so the star rating kind of sucks, I'm sure in equal measure to how much I disliked it there is someone out there who loves it...and they should.  I normally eat very little processed food but as I become more disabled I'm less able to cook, so in an effort to add variety, I picked a bunch of Progresso soups.  This Traditional Chicken and Sausage Gumbo really missed for me.  I kept taking a bite to see if I could figure out what I disliked specifically...I just couldn't make it swallow. I think I narrowed it down to the sausage, and even though there wasn't that much in the can, it had taken over all the other ingredients. I'm not so pampered, and loathe wasting food, I usually just choke it down and make it a point not to buy it again.  But in this case I did the best I could and put the other can in the giveaway bag.  I'm sure somebody else will love it.	-1
Spoiled on Campbells this mess is runny with no clams. Dog did not mind it.	-1
flavor was just not that good	-1
Really didn't like this, although I do like Mandarin oranges...too soft...and disappointed...won't buy again.	-1
Why is this so very white and opaque?  Even pure cream isn't this white and opaque.  I've read about food companies adding nanoparticles -- tiny particles of metal -- to make food appear white, without any evidence that they're safe and without a government requirement to list them on the ingredient label.  That aside, the soup's okay.  The potatoes are good but there's very little clam.  I wouldn't buy it again.	-1
If you like hot food, this is for you.  I have had Gumbo in New Orleans more than once and made by Louisiana natives several times in other states.  Never was it hot.  This was some time ago, and I think the general population is eating hotter food now.  So, maybe that is true about Gumbo...I don't know. I certainly did not expect anything hot when I ordered this.  Two stars because I ate it with crackers and a milk chaser.	-1
Unfortunately, didn't get to try this.  I ordered in a pantry box and when the box arrived, the top had been pushed in, opened and it was all over everything!  I had quite a mess cleaning everything up. I thought about complaining but figured it would be too much of a hassle to send it all back. I just pitched the few things that weren't salvageable(box products) and of course the soup. So never got to try it. That also makes me hesitate to order another pantry box with food.	-1
Never liked Progresso New England Clam Chowder and this is the final proof.  NO clams, too thin, and FAR, FAR from a New England Chowder which is actually T H I C K..........	-1
I was disappointed in this soup. The flavor was flat and spices kicked in only as an aftertaste. This is one of the few Progresso soups I don't care for.	-1
Eating this was like eating a cup of syrup with sugar cubes. Way too sweet, my daughter wouldn't even eat it.	-1
I ordered this in my prime pantry box. Thought with the cold weather coming it would be nice to have.  I've already used it, and threw the majority of the entire can in the trash.  The flavor was not so awful, it was the hard texture of the potatoes that made it bad for me.  I like soft potatoes in my soup.	-1
Progresso soups have been a staple at my house for years but this one is extremely disappointing.  Its primary ingredient is large chunks of chalky potato and hard to taste anything else.  I refuse to eat this and cannot recommend it to anyone.	-1
Its like potato soup and very watery tastes bland ..did not like it at all	-1
Too much potato. Took a few spoonfuls and was left with a pile of potatoes and a couple bits of clam.	-1
Meh	-1
The products were open and spoiled. I don't have any more words to say about this to fill the requirement.	-1
Beef is minimal in this soup. It's last on the list of ingredients. It's not rich, even though I added cheddar cheese to thicken it. Otherwise it would have been a thin soup. I would not buy this again, it's almost tasteless.	-1
Tastes nothing like pot roast. The broth is good but the rest of it I discarded.	-1
Cans busted--second time!	-1
Same problem as with the other New England Clam Chowder (not the rich & hearty) nausea!!!  Believe there must be something wrong with this batch.	-1
Progresso soup used to taste better.  This soup has very few veggies and meat.  It's not even close to what's shown on the can.  Also, I ordered this and other soups thru PrimePantry and the majority of the order was delivered with one or two cans per small box.  One shipment was 16 individual boxes!  Crazy.  Hopefully they had just ran out of larger boxes, and it won't be the norm.  I like PrimePantry, but I'll discontinue using it if they repeat for my recent order.	-1
SOUR!	-1
I purchased the Alfredo chicken and penne flavor and was surprised when I poured it into the bowl. There was a LOT of sauce and not a lot of solid food coming out. After warming it up, I noticed it had absolutely zero chicken in it. It was pasta and sauce, a litle bit of onion and that's it. The flavor was pretty good and the overall tase of my "vegetarian" soup was fine but don't put "chicken" on the label, put pictures of chicken on the label and then give the consumer no chicken. I went to a second location, bought the same product thinking it might be a fluke. Nope..second can. No chicken.	-1
too expensive for what you get.	-1
This soup makes me wonder if Progresso is not contracting with another company to make its soup ( This idea is not far-- fetched.  Years ago botulism was found in a particular brand of soup. When the public was warned about this they were told that the same soup was being sold under a list of companies' names including premium brands). This is the worst Progresso soup I have ever eaten. It is NOT loaded with potatos and it is rather watery to boot. I am going to spend my money on the Campbell's Chunky Soups from now on.  They are less expensive  and  the quality is consistently good.	-1
Last time I ever order fruit cups online. They sat for a couple day before unpacked. About 4 of the cups leaked and made  huge sticky mess.	-1
Not having a positive experience with ordering can goods, they come bent.	-1
Didn't like it as much you guys still have a unbeatable prices	-1
NOT NEAR AS GOOD AS CAMBELLS	-1
I used to love this soup and it was the only kind I would buy. Now it's mostly noodles and the carrots often have dark brown spots. The celery pieces are very large. I have given this product many chances over the past year and all the cans seem to have the same issues.	-1
RECEIVED BENT???	-1
This soup is really bad.  The broth is ok but VERY salty and the rest is nasty.	-1
The pasta in it has been too soft.	-1
I bought several cans.  First can, I got sick and threw up after eating.  Didn't make a connection to the soup.  Second can (a week later), the same thing happened but this time I nearly blacked out and got muscle cramps.  I then realized it was the Progresso soups.  Back to Campbell's I go.  I will never buy Progresso soups again in my life.	-1
No flavor whatsoever!	-1
Dented	-1
Did not buy.	-1
Grainy and not great flavor. I usually love the baked goods by this brand so I am disappointed.	-1
HAD TO TOSS OUT.....EVERY FOOD ITEM IN MY PANTRY BOX WAS CONTAMINATED BY A LEAKING BOTTLE OF CLOROX CLEANER	-1
I didn't like the corn powder thing in it. I didn't even taste the honey. It just felt like a plain bread with some sugar and dry corn powder.  Tasted better to eat with coffee, but not gonna buy again.	-1
The texture is weird...more like a cake than cornbread.	-1
boy this was a disappointed.. Dry, thick and awful unpleasant taste. Very disappointed. Wont ever buy again.	-1
This has to be one of the most disgusting things I've ever tasted. What is wrong with you people? Seriously. This is just so much no. So much no.	-1
This was a big let down. The cheese sauce was nauseating to me . You might like it though.	-1
Too messy for me!  Can't get the stuff off your pot.	-1
Very small box. Better off going to grocery.	-1
These aren't nearly as good as they used to be. I'll never buy them again.	-1
Won't buy these again. The box bottom makes them difficult to bite without the whole thing breaking apart. Also, they were quite stale tasting, almost chewy.	-1
Trans Fat, really Pop Secret? Who uses this poison any more?! Should have looked at the label more carefully before purchasing.	-1
Easy to use horrible taste	-1
they were stale and broken.	-1
Crushed all up	-1
Don't waste your time or money .... this is just tortillas, seasoning, and a VERY small amount of cheese sauce. My family found it VERY disappointing. I like their other products but this is a fail.	-1
A bit stale, bottom cracks in wrong place,,, nice idea, but fail	-1
were stale but worked as expected, little more expensive then brick and mortar stores, but hey, front door delivery.	-1
Arrived crushed stale and very close to the expiration date .. I will not be purchasing these again disappointed	-1
These shells suck! Sorry but they are only good for staying in place while you fill them up but the moment you take a bite the completely break!	-1
Broken bits and stale.  Not happy with this purchase at all.  I ended up using it in a caserole because I sure couldn't make tacos.	-1
These were stale	-1
Stale, broken.	-1
These crack apart too easily.  The two 90 degree angles in these taco shells seem to be too much for a corn tortilla to handle.	-1
Seemed a little stale and about a thrd were broken.	-1
Well, we basically bought overpriced, broken tortilla chips. I have no idea how they function as a shell because every single one of them arrived broken. Both boxes. The taste was as expected for a taco salad but my disappointment is great and we will not order these online ever again. We were really looking forward to these for dinner last night. Oh well.	-1
Too many broken shells	-1
All broke	-1
Ok, this was a bit of a disappointment to me. I don't know why I thought these would be so much better than they were. It comes with tortillas, cheese and seasoning. I make tacos a lot so I have a HUGE taco seasoning from one of the wholesale clubs on hand. Basically all this kit gave me was four tortillas, and some cheese (I prefer to fresh grate cheese anyhow). This was my fault, should have read the package better but if you are a regular cook, you probably have most of the items they give you on hand already, save yourself a lot of money and just buy a big pack of tortillas yourself. You have to buy the meat, sour cream, taco sauce, salsa and tomatoes anyhow for this.	-1
They were all broken when I received them	-1
Normally I wouldn't rate with one star, but these came completely ruined.  Because the prime pantry boxes are so full they were crushed and not usable.	-1
Have not opened yet but suspect they will be crushed as the rest of the order was.	-1
Very tasty but a little too hot.	-1
I did not like the flavor at all. The consistency was weird also. This is the first coconut milk I have tried so  I have no basis for comparison. I would not buy again.	-1
I like to use coconut milk to make sweet drinks like hot chocolate. This was the worst coconut milk I have ever had. It made my cocoa taste bad.	-1
I ordered this to try it - I usually order Zevia, and this was much cheaper.  As they say - you get what you pay for.  They taste like a metal can with a weird aftertaste that I can't describe - period.  The 6 pack plastic does not work, cans are loose.  Two were pierced and made a mess.  I could have worked with that if the soda was any good, but don't waste your money here.  I am back to Zevia and natural sweeteners.	-1
Very dry.	-1
Bought these for my daughter as a healthier snack alternative to sugar-filled cereal bars and she said after first bite she wanted to spit it out but she sucked it up and finished the first one off. She said she'll eat the rest with a spread of a nut butter on them as they are quite TASTELESS by themselves. (We use to eat these years ago and liked them but I use to buy flavorful ones i.e. with cinnamon/dry cheese cheddar coating, etc and they were tastier. I most likely won't buy these particular BLAND ones again.	-1
Very old and bland. I know that they are rice cakes and are supposed to be bland but this was ridiculous. Also, they crumbled the moment I tried to separate them. They were so stuck together that I just threw the bag away.	-1
these taste awful. I added honey to try and make it better and me and my boyfriend could NOT finish one. Bad smell and bad taste	-1
forgot how dry and hard they were, always looking for low Calorie snacks, this did not fit the bill	-1
It was out of date before it ever arrived at my house. Watch what you buy.	-1
Hard and tasteless.  That just about sums it up.  Hard to chew, no taste at all; takes a ton of topping, eg, peanut butter, to impart any flavor to these dried out hockey pucks.	-1
So I went to the supermarket and they have the chocolate Krave & the Smor's Krave on sale. The price was 3 for $5 and I was happy and bought a bunch. This is my first and last time having anything to do with anything called Krave, they are beyond disgusting. I threw away the 2 open ones and gave the rest to my friend who is financially challenged and will eat anything that is not poisonous. By the way if you add milk to Krave it goes from disgusting to garbage dunked in milk and blended with fish guts.	-1
need a sugar rush? way to sweet and chocolaty for my taste. and 4 boxes was way to much so i need a mom to give it to now.	-1
It's cereal, right? How bad could it be? Well, in this case, pretty damned bad. I was expecting something like Chex filled with chocolate because that's what they look like, but the whole grain outside tastes terrible. I couldn't finish it. My father liked snacking on them with coffee, so I gave them a two instead of one star.	-1
I was excited when I saw the commercial for Krave.  Being a genetic chocoholic (my entire family as far back as we know) I knew I'd try it as soon as it hit the shelves in spite of not being truly satisfied with *any* chocolate flavored cereal - ever - even as a kid.  I purchased a box of each variety and tried the "plain" one first. Of course the first thing I had to do was bite one in half to see the chocolate center.  I had to really look to see the very small, thin strip of chocolate on one side of the inside of the hollow pillow.  Nothing like the box photo which seems to show a full chocolate center (could that be considered false advertising?).  I ate a few dry.  They were "just OK".  The outer shell is somewhat bland but the chocolate seemed to come through a bit, however nothing as strong or full as I'd expected.  Considering the size of the strip I wasn't totally surprised at this result.  So out comes the milk for a bowl full.  It works OK with milk but has a very odd mouth feel.  Somewhat grainy but the chocolate stood out more and presented a more chocolate flavor than when eaten dry.  It's not a *great* chocolate, tasting much like a chocolate syrup mixed with a chocolate spread, but acceptable for a breakfast cereal having a bit more chocolate flavor than most.  Then the side effects hit.  The chocolate didn't really melt as much as it combined with the shell turning into a paste that stuck to my teeth much like a gummy snack.  Bummer.  Then, after only a few spoonfuls, the shell began to get soggy.  The mouth feel was a bit better when soggy (not as grainy) but the gummy effect seemed to intensify.  I was very disappointed with the cereal and couldn't wait for the box to empty so I could move on to something better.  The sad part is I still have a box of the chocolate outer shell variety that I just can't bring myself to open.  I *did* cut the product coupon off the box just in case the chocolate outer shell version is better than the "plain" version.  I have a strong feeling that coupon will expire.	-1
this apple juice does not taste good going back to mott,s apple juice is bettere	-1
At least one bottle was damaged inside the case and leaked out (the case is unopened). The cardboard the bottles sit in is soaked, the plastic is sticky, the shipping box bottom is soaked also. You can see one bottle that is leaking, it has less than half of the amount of juice as the others. Very disappointed by this and requested a refund. I will not be back.	-1
I much prefer the cans or bags of nut products. These aren't my style. Might be yours, though.	-1
I did not like these, they tasted like rice to me. I gave them away. That is a personal preference, however.	-1
not your expected cracker. Very hard, taste like cardboard. disappointed	-1
I wasn't sure what to expect but what I got was a product that tasted like crunchy paper, no flavor, no salt nothing.  The highlight of the ad stated Almond---no taste of anything almond. They were not pricey but I still felt like I got ripped off of the amount that I did spend. At least I didn't buy more than one box. Wish it had been good, was looking for a snack that had something good for me and tasty.	-1
smashed in box	-1
Taste like wood! Gross	-1
Not pleased with this product. I purchased a variety of unsweetened vegan milk options from Prime Pantry, and this one ranked middle to low. Sour notes constantly have me stopping to put my mug down and sniff it to see if its spoiling. Unpleasant. Not going to get this product often, if at all.	-1
Very thin and tasteless. Not a good substitute for milk as real milk is thicker and sweeter.	-1
Love almonds - not almond milk.	-1
CONTAINERS WERE NEARLY SMASHED FLAT ...OPEN CLOROX CLEANER CONTAMINATED ALL OTHER FOOD PRODUCTS IN BOX.  I'M AFRAID TO GIVE THIS TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER	-1
Bland as can be. I don't understand why "organic" must be bland. Will not be ordering this again on Amazon Fresh.	-1
Do not care for this	-1
I don't like the flavor... So I think I will not buy it again.	-1
Taste seems a bit off and it isn't as good as Rice Dream even though it is a bit less in cost.	-1
I normally buy Silk almond milk which is perishable but this was so inexpensive that I decided to try it. I like Silk almond milk because it tastes great and it is Non-GMO. This product is neither. Also this almond milk doesn't taste like almonds at all.	-1
This tastes like watered down chalk juice or some kind of watered down paint, plus it has mystery ingredients that do not enhance flavor!	-1
yuk	-1
Could not bring myself to continue drinking it- even with honey and diluted with water. Horrible. I didn't notice anything after taking it for 2 weeks every day- gave up because of the taste!	-1
I've bought this Organic Apple Cider Vinegar before, and I've also seen it in stores.  Never have I seen it (or any other organic ACV) priced anywhere near what it costs here.  The fault is my own for not paying closer attention to the size of the bottles, but I do think there is a bit of deception--or at the very least, price gouging--in this being sold for the same price that two 32 oz. bottles (twice as much!) would normally sell for.  The vinegar itself is very good, and I don't mean for my review to reflect otherwise; however, most people buying this product already know how great it is.  Those who already use the product might easily assume (as I did) that the bottles are the 32 oz., because the price is in line with that, and those who have not bought this product before should be warned that this product can be gotten for half the price.  Two 16 oz. bottles for $16.49 is the same price as I'd normally pay for two 32 oz. bottles!  Please take note of this if you are considering purchasing this item.	-1
a thin tomato paste somehow I was expecting tomato chunks	-1
I love almond milk, I prefer sweetened almond milk. I ordered this chocolate to have as a treat but I was not happy with this product at all. It didn't taste like anything especially chocolate! :(	-1
Not sure why the taste is flat. When I get this brand in the half gallon at the store, it is chocolaty. This box had no flavor at all.	-1
Boo, these arrived leaking all over the rest of my order. Will buy at the store next time.	-1
I usually get Silk, but decided to the this because it came Prime Pantry. I threw it out.	-1
Thought this would taste better than it was, but not...	-1
Tomato soup from a can (store brand) is better.	-1
disappointed in the flavor.....chose it because of favorable reviews......wouldn't buy it again.	-1
Yucky! Will stick to Trader Joe's boxed soups.	-1
This would be such a great product if it didn't have a chemistry set taste. I don't understand why as the flavors are not supposed to artificial. Disappointing.	-1
These do not taste like any fruit or substitute. Every color tastes exactly the same. They have become a dog treat.	-1
Dry, dry, and dry.	-1
These often tear open just below the slider closure. Very poorly made.	-1
to much hutch	-1
NO "extra butter."  Is bland and there are LOTS of the 'skins' left on the popped corn which get in your teeth.  I would not buy this product again.  I a.lso had to put some salt on it too	-1
has sugar in it	-1
SO disappointing. Dry, not a lovely buttery taste. There are so many brands that are simply delicious.	-1
Homestyle = greasy, salty, bad for you goodness. This crap is 1/3 the fat but tastes bland and gross, and old which is weird for fresh microwave popcorn. From now on I'm just getting the full-size bags 1/3 as often.	-1
Blah taste, "homestyle" what? Not worth buying.	-1
Want to put a little high fructose corn syrup on your meat?  Then buy this bbq sauce.  This is a sweet BBQ sauce. However, nutritionists and doctors recommend staying away from high fructose corn syrup and this sauce lists it as the first ingredient. Why is HFCS bad for you? Here's what a cardiologist says:  "High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a type of sugar that has been processed and combined with corn syrup to produce a cheap, easily dissolvable sweetener. But this sugar is quickly absorbed by the liver where it is converted into fat. Since your brain doesn't recognize HFCS as regular food, it never shuts off the appetite center -- so you keep eating. Blood sugar levels rise, massive amounts of insulin is recruited to metabolize it and then you crash and feel hungry again. It is found in soft drinks, fruit juices, salad dressings and baked goods. Read the food labels of products in your pantry and refrigerator and throw out all products that contain HFCS."   A family member bought this brand without reading the label, so we'll be throwing it out. Too much corn syrup does nasty things to your body - there are BBQ Sauces which are healthier. This one lists it as a primary ingredient:  High Fructose Corn Syrup, Distilled Vinegar, Tomato Paste, Modified Food Starch, contains less than 2% of: Salt, Pineapple Juice Concentrate, Natural Smoke Flavor, Spices, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate as a preservative, Molasses, Corn Syrup, Garlic,* Sugar, Tamarind, Natural Flavor.  If you only like sweet BBQ sauces, then they may be high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup. There are tangier sauces which contain no high fructose corn syrup and are lower in sugar.  I personally like Stubbs BBQ which you can get on Amazon which doesn't have high fructose corn syrup.	-1
Bottle crushed..hard to get unwrapped	-1
i am soooo disappointed. this has sodium benzoate and other additives! not mentioned above. it is not really 100 percent lime juice, and certainly not pure.	-1
Really sweet not like real lime juice.	-1
This is not good quality tea or even as good as tea you get at a fast food restaurant. I bought this at a upscale grocery store in my area so surprised the taste was "funky" like a bad taste to it I couldn't quite put my  finger on.  A friend of mine came by an saw what was left of it in my fridge, which was most the bottle, and I told them go ahead an have it if they liked it, as I didn't.  They took two sips and made the same conclusion, they didn't like it either.  They said it tasted like it had been made with low quality water, as in unfiltered - even dirty tap water!  Maybe that was the unpleasant under taste I could not identify? I do not suggest this tea - the rest is going in the trash as soon as I finish this review.	-1
dont waste your money, lids are cracked, very cheap product.	-1
Washed on top rack of dishwasher and the lids warped, but still able to use...but for how long?	-1
This tastes like you made it yourself with a Lipton tea bag and didn't add any sugar. Not a delightful and unique flavor by any means. Even after the soy-like taste from your first sips is gone you're still stuck with the taste of unsweetened Lipton teabag tea.	-1
Don't like taste.	-1
My favorite tea, my daily treat ( I have Chrons) just price jumped from 13.99 a case to 30.91 a case! Out of my ability to buy!!!  I don't begrudge a profit, this is a slaughter!	-1
Tops keep breaking	-1
Has a weird fake taste. Love the jasmine and I usually love mint, so I figured this would be a winner. My whole family agrees this one tastes icky. My daughter grows mint out front (it's her baby) and adding that to tea is wonderful, but this one is not tase-tea at all. Get the jasmine, that is really good! Lemongrass is a step down from the jasmine one. The straight green tea is a bit more bitter than them all.	-1
perfect size	-1
EDIT, 10/31/15: still everything below true.  I think I have but two or three of the original set, left.  The rest either melted in the microwave or the tops tore, and I'm not sorry to see them go.  I got Ziplock and Tupperware and plain old (better, actually) Kroger brand to work better.  These all have FLAT tops.  The GLAD bowl design is better, but that top is a killer and too much temptation for me to buy again until the top is fixed.  Okay, I need to use Bible's 1John1:9 (naming my sins to God, here of anger) every time I use these.  Thankfully out of the original group I purchased five years prior, most became damaged; so, I've only a few left.  THEY WILL NOT STACK because some dufus thought that center poptop was a good idea.  All these years have now passed and still the design is used?  So now it's the customer's fault for buying, no longer MADware's.  The tops wreck an otherwise quality product.  Hard to store, NO they don't clamp together, and NO they don't stack, so that everything wobbles in your freezer.  But YES they microwave decently (not for all foods and not for too long, but defrosting works well), and YES they hold up under repeated abuse straight from the freezer.  They are a softer plastic so not as brittle.  I don't like how the top ridge is so thick.. but I'd start buying them again if they got rid of that circle in the middle top and reverted to the old flat-top style which made you GLAD to use GLADware.  Okay, maybe I need 1John 1:9 again.  I name my sin of MADware aggravation, Dad. :)	-1

The packaging was upbeat and came delivered securely.  That being said, this may have been the most foul tasting drink i have had in some time. Maybe i got a batch that was processed with Flint MI water.  There certainly are a number of positive reviews so perhaps this is just my taste or I got a bad batch. If i just didn't like it, i probably wouldnt have bothered reviewing but i felt obligated as a consumer to throw in with all the positives.	-1
Worst tasting tea I have ever drank.. I almost vomited.	-1
I love the other Ito En Tea of Jasmine.. nice "flowery" flavor but I tried this flavor 2-3 times over a few weeks and couldn't figure out the problem. Finally I tasted it one day and thought.. that is it! I had quit smoking about 2 years ago and realized this tea tasted like liquid cigarette which may be fine with some people or possibly a different palate. Realize I always tried it cold also, having bought it for a cold drink.  Someone came over today and without mentioning anything but, "taste this" she took one swallow and said "tobacco". She is a smoker.  Two stars due to the tea looks good, clear, presented in a nice bottle but I can honestly say the flavor is very unique and not for me.	-1
this dreadful product has absolutely NOTHING to do with the original Grey Poupon, It's just awful. I hadn't purchased a bottle of this in a long time.....as it lasts for awhile. But this stuff.... I mistakenly poured out about a third of a new bottle opening it, it pours like a thin salad dressing, nothing like the original stiff dijon that had a little thickness to it, more than a little viscosity. this stuff's got a singular bland and slightly unappetizing color, nothing like the original. the taste is one note, with way too much heat....... not sure why Kraft felt the need to change the wonderful original formula, but they destroyed it. Kind of like they did with their line of their classic salad dressings, I recently purchased the French, Italian and Russian, and they were all inedible as well.	-1
If you like horseradish then this is for you.  It will bring tears to your eyes. Very strong in that flavor and Mustard takes a back seat .  I didn't like it.  I ended up fixing it my way adding mayonnaise and mustard until I could tolerate the horseradish.	-1
Too much Italian herbs and not enough tomato flavor, not to mention the overdose of salt they added to the mix.  I will take a pass on this next time I am looking for a quick sauce to make my favorite pizza bagels.	-1
Again, cans were dented. I will try prime pantry one more time. Do not order canned goods with anything else, as the cans leaked on the dry goods.	-1
Didn't like texture, smell or taste.	-1
dented can	-1
yuck. forms a sticky paste in your mouth.	-1
no original or even close; much thinner, more brittle, more tasteless, a hint of chemical sort of oat flavor- so some VP figured out how to roll out mush and pretend it was crackers; bought the name; won't again, too expensive for bird food	-1
These crackers taste more like cookies.  They're way too sweet. All the sugar cancels out the benefits of them being "whole grain".	-1
Smashed product ,oatmeal all over inside packing box..... Pretty god damn sad.	-1
I paid almost $3 for this little bitty container.. when I buy at the store, I pay $1.88 for the BIG container..I didn't see oz. when I ordered.	-1
The bottom of the Quaker Oats was open at the bottom of boxes. Some of the oatmeal spelled in the box.	-1
This is way to small! The price I paid I got the huge one at a local store. Will not get again. Remember not all is cheap on here.	-1
Would have been fine but it came damaged from a liquid soap leak in the pantry box. The oats smelled like palm olive. No returns allowed, so I had to throw the entire thing away.	-1
Arrived in same box my fabric softener and clothes soap.  My oats tasted like chemicals.  Also it's the tiny container of oats.	-1
Good	-1
Love this product, but I mistakenly thought I was getting a much larger container for the price. Lesson -- read all the fine print!	-1
I should have read the box size before I purchased. However, that being said, I have never seen an oatmeal cylinder this small in the store. It MIGHT have enough for 4 bowls. I assumed that it must be the same item I have purchased before because it was a similar price that I pay at my local wal-store. So I bought two. The 2 combined don't equal one average cylinder. So my overall grippe is that it is WAY over priced. I fell for the suckers bet, don't make the same mistake.	-1
Small for price	-1
Small package.  Thought it was a full size.	-1
These are unfortunately my family's least favorite instant mashed potato. They seem saltier and more "fake" tasting than our usual Betty Crocker instant mash.	-1
yuck, the smell was very off putting. The flavor was mediocre. The consistency was right but overall it just did not hit the mark.	-1
not good	-1
Didn't care for the flavor or consistency. It was very easy to prepare. Maybe I'm not the best judge of instant potatoes - I'm a die-hard made from scratch from real potatoes kind of girl.	-1
package soaking wet	-1
I liked both the roasted garlic and the herb & butter flavored varieties of this same product but found the four cheese flavor to be sickeningly very artificial and unpleasant, and in no way resembling anything close to being cheese flavored. I had to seriously "doctor up" the four cheese potatoes with seasonings of my own just to make it edible.	-1
Taste is very subjective, of course, and there are lots of 5 star reviews here, but these tasted terrible to me.  Way too much artificial "butter" flavor and no "potato" flavor.  Very creamy, thin texture, I prefer more texture in mash potatoes.  Still searching for good instant mash potatoes. I agree with the one other reviewer who said the Betty Crocker were better, but they, too, are not that good.  I will not buy again.	-1
Too cheddary for my taste.	-1
Warning:  Don't buy if you live in a hot, humid climate.  I live in south Florida and within days, these boxes of sugar were rock-hard blocks.  I keep them in the refrigerator now, but they're basically impossible to use.  I'm thinking I will just make a gargantuan batch of sweet tea or lemonade with them, so I can melt the whole block down at once -- if not, it could come in handy as a weapon should I ever need to hit someone with a brick.	-1
I will admit that I have no idea what real Albacore tastes like, but this tastes like tuna with no flavor. It's nasty. For the record I love Bumble Bee's chunk light tuna. This tastes like tasteless tuna.	-1
We buy BumbleBee brand tuna all the time. The cans in this case were fine on the outside. Opened the up to find the tuna inside was disgusting. I have contacted BumbleBee and am awaiting a response. In the mean time I am very disappointed in the tuna quality, and wasted my money.	-1
Bumble Bee is off my shopping list.  Of course, it is distributed by Bumble Bee but the "product" is from China.	-1
This product is not what I expected.  This tuna as not as white as expected.  It is brownish.  The 4 oz. cans of tuna differ ... the tuna is white, fresh and smells delicious.	-1
Not a good tuna, won't order it again.	-1
i thought I was buying in water :-(	-1
by the time you squeeze all the water out of the can you end up with a half of a can of tuna..its a ripoff. Walmart brand solid white at 1.50 a can can't be beat, and the cans are full.	-1
beige water	-1
Received in excellent condition. Thank you.  Love it.	-1
I received a very large & heavy box containing canned food items. At least half were dented. Opening the pull tab is therefore difficult or use a can opener.	-1
Fruit was kind of hard on the ends. Kind of hard to eat. Wouldn't buy again. Good juice	-1
bad can smelt horrible , pinning in can was coming out	-1
Taste just ok...	-1
Didn't like these. They tasted old, and odd. I threw most of the can away.	-1
The product is fine but I nearly cut the top of my finger off trying to get their "Pop & Peel Lid" open.  One can I had to use a hammer and screwdriver to open, one opened fine, the 3rd one was the one that nearly cut the tip of my finger off, I am afraid to ever buy or try opening any of these anymore.  It's frustrating the one I opened with a hammer and screwdriver was the one I took with me to work for food but could NOT get it open until I came home.	-1
not very good	-1
DENTED. LOOK AS IF JUST THROWN IN THE BOX. RESOLVE ON CANS A D LABELS.	-1
Arrived busted--a second time!	-1
very dented can	-1
This rice was very bland - not much flavor of any kind.	-1
I normally buy these at the grocery store but I wanted to save myself the trip. Unfortunely the raisins were stale! I have never had this happen with this product until now. I love Oatmeal Raisin Cookies and raisins in my cooked oatmeal. I managed to use them all up.	-1
Dented cans. Hard to open. Not packaged with care. Open carefully if dented so you don't get cut. Kids love them.	-1
Product arrived damaged!	-1
arrived dented on the pop top part so in other words not worth taking a chance it could have botulism! I HATE the pop top cans mostly a waste of money cuz they're too easily compromised.	-1
DENTED.  LOOKED AS IF JUST THROWN IN THE BOX.  RESOLVE ALL OVER CANS AND LABELS.	-1
I am very please with the product.	-1
every can is bent. i don't eat food from bent cans	-1
This is the first Nabisco product I have EVER purchased that is just awful.  Both the crackers as well as the dipping cheese are so horribly salty that no one in my family can/will eat this product.  Unbelievable how much salt crystals is on each cracker.  Did no good to try and brush off as much salt as possible since the cheese is also overtly brined with salt.  Disgusting.  Cannot recommend.  Wound up throwing the whole box, sans the ONE package we opened to try, in the trash.	-1
none	-1
Ritz got rid of the little red spreader sticks that used to come with these.  Now you're expected to dip your crackers in the cheese sauce which, in my opinion, puts too much cheese on one small area of cracker.  If you want to spread the cheese across the whole cracker, you have to use another cracker to do it...and that cracker usually breaks very easily.	-1
The crackers are pretty gross :(	-1
The cheese is too runny now. I think it's because they removed the spreader stick and now the cracker is supposed to be dipped. I would not purchase again unless Ritz changes the product back to it's original formula.	-1
Warm cheese..children didn't like them. Refund please!	-1
I haven't had these since I was a child and I wish I never bought them. They are very low quality. The cheese has no flavor and the crackers seemed like some failed Easy Bake Oven product.	-1
Just too dang dry for me.	-1
The crackers tasted stale and the cheese food substance was a little gross.	-1
Too small and not good cheese,toosalty	-1
Why the hell did I buy this processed garbage from my childhood?	-1
The crackers are saltier than other Ritz crackers I've had.	-1
These are not like the animal crackers in the box I remember. They are thicker, and the flavor is kind of flat and cardboardy.  I put them in a bowl at a party, and every single person was excited to flash back to childhood, and they all said "these don't taste the same at all"  I had almost a full bowl at the end.	-1
Crappy crackers now.  Taste like cardboard.  What happened to the plain white crackers that tasted good. Also the cheese is crap now.	-1
bag is super small	-1
Upon arrival in my Prime Pantry box I noticed the expiration date was months away. Despite this supposed freshness, these animal crackers had a very odd flavor, not like other animal crackers at all. No one in our household will eat them. I did crush a bunch up to use as a crust for a cheesecake, but they're a waste to buy just for that purpose. I eventually just threw them away. Definitely won't be buying these again. Heck, I couldn't even tell what the stamped animal shapes were supposed to be.	-1
These tasted so bad like the flavor of plastic I threw them out. I would not even give them to the squirrels!  Nothing like the taste from years ago.	-1
For school boxes top	-1
Package says:  Produced with genetic engineering!!!!	-1
no. funny taste in these	-1
I  remember these in the 80s when they had real cheese that was hard, you would use the stick to cut it into four equal sections (they never gave enough cheese for all the crackers) Now its way worse! the section where the "cheese" is got smaller and it's only HALF FULL of I don't know what, but I certainly wouldn't call it cheese, it's nothing like it used to be, it has the consistancy of soft margarine, gross IMO It tastes chemically and it looks fake too, bleck, I still can't get the gross taste out of my mouth. my dog likes it or it would go in the trash (the cheese part)	-1
These had a weird taste.  I'm not sure if the flavor has changed since I was a child or if something was not right, but they did not taste right at all.	-1
Grandkids didn't like them. I got a belly ache.	-1
Nastiest tasting animal crackers I have ever had.  Threw them out to the birds.	-1
I bought these to tide me over until I could get my family-sized tub from Wegman's (their brand). They are NOT good. I remember what animal crackers used to taste like--nothing like this. I went to Wegman's and got my animal cookies. Love my low-fat snack that costs 10.00 for a 68 oz. tub. That will last a long time!	-1
Not very good tasting.	-1
These DO NOT taste like the Barnum's Animal Crackers that one can purchase in the cute little boxes.  These are bland, hard not crunchy and suitable only for those who have had their taste buds removed.	-1
Just didn't like this variety.	-1
Cleans okay but the smell is unpleasant, strong and long lasting on your skin. I can't believe it was even put on the market smelling this bad! Disappointed.	-1
I was unable to tolerate odor of this product.	-1
The pumps on these are bad! The soap is great, but doubt I will ever but again.	-1
This was a poor purchase for me. I was looking into natural, chemical free products and stumbled upon Meyer's. I really did enjoy the scent, but that was about it. The spout once pushed down doesn't not come back up on its own. In addition, the mechanism for pushing the soap out of the spout often only squirts a little or a splattery mess. The soap itself requires two or three pumps to actually create bubbles on your hands and get a thorough washing. Because of this, it is running out fairly quickly, and I will not be purchasing again --- or any other meyer's products for that matter.	-1
Lemon verbena is NOT lemon verbena! Smells something else! I'm extremely disappointed especially that lemon verbena on other soaps is my favorite	-1
I couldn't wait to use this up so I wouldn't have to use it any more.  The scent is awful and it doesn't cut the oil on my skin very well.  I bought the rhubarb scent at the same time, and I like that one better.	-1
Too slippery!  It all ends up in the sink, not on hands.	-1
the pump malfunction	-1
It's a good soap that I use everyday but I don't get a lemon verbena fragrance from it at all. Natural smells are very important to me and this is just a soap smell. It smell better than most soaps, just not what I wanted.	-1
This smells so synthetically strong. It makes the whole space smell "off". I have no desire to eat near anything that's been washed by this stuff.	-1
Very drying I have used other products buy this brand but never a hand soap	-1
Wouldn't repurchase	-1
Talk about disappointed....that's an understatement. Not only does it smell rancid, and there is no hint of lavender. Then there's the problem I had using this soap. My hands because so irritated and inflamed, I needed to use cortisone cream to heal them. Honestly, the skin on my hands were red and extremely dry. For some reason I thought Mrs. Meyer's soaps were organic and free of chemicals. The long list of ingredients proves it's not. I won't be buying this brand again.	-1
I want to start off and say I ordered this because I absolutely love Meyers Honey suckle hand soap, but because it was not available I thought I would try the Clean day which has Lemon Verbena. At first the smell is nice, but then after like 5 seconds it gets exceedingly overwhelming. So be forewarned!	-1
Perfumie smell	-1
Lathers well, smells okay, but dries my hands out. Probably won't buy again	-1
After reading the reviews, I decided to give this fabric softener a try.  Was very disappointed.  I will not be buying again and will stick to my Downy.	-1
I find this nasty smelling. So much so that I tossed it out. This is subjective obviously, and some one else might not mind the odor.	-1
I'm disappointed. There's not even a hint of lavender scent. If you're looking for a nice smelling lavender soap, you won't find it with this.  In fact, the smell isn't even remotely pleasant. It's kind of stinky....not pleasant at all.  I've used many different brands of soaps, and this ranks at the bottom, in my opinion. I'm especially surprised how much it irritates my hands. So badly that I actually had to use cortisone cream on them. I know my skin is sensitive and often dry in the cold, winter months. That's why I like using natural soaps, especially this time of year. Yes, it cleans and suds up nicely. I don't like how much it irritates my hands, though.  It arrived nicely packaged in a plastic bag, just in case it leaked, so it wouldn't make a mess on the other products in the box. I'm disappointed and obviously sensitive to one of the ingredients, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad product. It's not good for me. However, if you're looking for a nice lavender smelling soap, you won't find it with this. The smell isn't remotely pleasant. In fact, it smells rancid.   Sorry, Mrs Meyer's, I won't be buying your soap again.	-1
I purchased two of these soaps because 1) I'm trying to go natural and 2) I love the lavender scent.  Well, this cannot be natural lavender.  It smells like a cheap perfume that lingers FOREVER!!!! It's horrible, awful......I'm going to add peppermint t essential oil to mine to see if that helps....after all I did pay for this mess of a product.  Hopefully the pump stands up for me to make my own hand soap......	-1
Not so much.	-1
If I ate one of these blindfolded I am sure I wouldn't be able to tell they were caramel. Lackluster flavor...just blah. Won't buy again.	-1
I read the package.  "rich and creamy",  it is not.  It's texture is chalky.  When it dissolves, it becomes a sugary texture.  No buttery flavor if you are use to real butter and cream.  Not what I was looking for and not what I remember as a good caramel.  Kraft use to be better.  They changed the formula to save money just as other big companies have.  It isn't good enough to be a substitute.  I'm going to have to make my own if I want the flavor and texture.	-1
Ordering food online saves carrying heavy canned items around the store, into the car and up the stairs, so I tried this. It's OK.. a few too many potatoes, as I enjoy a lentil soup with more lentils...and am not used to added potatoes either, in my lentil soups. So, it's OK to have on hand, but I won't be ordering this again.	-1
watery not spicy	-1
Items received crushed, crushed into many small bits and pieces.	-1
Way Better makes a lighter, more flavorful blue tortilla. The Garten of Eaten Blues are not as light and have an almost burned taste.	-1
I was already compromising by buying a corn based chip, but check out the oil these are made with (especially Canola... toxic). Wish I had before the purchase.	-1
Bleh.  I don't like this at all.  I have no idea why this is so popular.  It's only faintly peanut-y, it's far too sweet, and it has an unnatural smooth texture that's more reminiscent of hair conditioner than food.	-1
bag was open as spilled all over box.	-1
This is NOT natural peanut butter! It contains other oil and sugar added with a whipped consistency. It's inedible for me as it contains sugar whereas Natural peanut butter does not. I bought 10 thinking it was actually natural. Very disappointed as I have protein deficiencies and rely on peanut butter daily. I m home bound disabled and was very much looking forward to this product being as advertised. Natural penut butter contains ONLY PEANUTS and salt!	-1
These were opened and all over the bottom of the box which made the bottom of the box oily  These chips are great but I paid for chips that I can't eat.	-1
Not very tasty. ..not what I expected	-1
Used to love these. Searched around Austin but fewer grocers carry them. Excited to find them on Amazon. Sadly, they have gone from blue to brown and nearly tasteless. Seems to be true of too many organic products. Just opened second bag. Brown. Tasteless. Too thick. Reduced to 1 star.	-1
Taste funny.	-1
This got a pool of oil on the top in a short period of time, tried stirring it up, didn't work very well, threw it out.	-1
Its almost to creamy, like buttery.  We didn't like it.	-1
There is absolutely NOTHING healthy about Canola Oil aka Rapeseed Oil. This is just another product designed to look like a healthy alternative, when in reality it's NOT!	-1
Doesn't produce much in the way of suds and the scent is just not there.  It doesn't seem to produce enough lather/suds to  clean.  I followed up with my regular bar of soap,  since I didn't feel clean after using this.	-1
Ugh, not a fan of these chips. They tasted stale and were too thick. I ended up tossing most of the bag because no one else in the house liked them. Sometimes healthier is simply not tasty enough.	-1
Mmmmm	-1
I am a big fan of Old Spice in the original scent. This body wash was for my husband, but when he showered with it, the smell was overwhelming & made my throat & nose irritated. Not a fan.	-1
Well I did not get to try this product as when it showed up (underneath a bag of kitty litter) as the entire bag had been smashed. All that remained of this product was an empty bag and a pile of blue dust. The chips may be quite good, but I write this 1 star review to point out that ordering chips through PrimePantry may not be the smartest thing to do until they figure out how to package things appropriately. I would also encourage Hain Celestial Group to hold Amazon accountable for poor placement in the PrimePantry box.	-1
This body wash smells great on the surface, but for some reason once you lather it up, the smell changes and it's very off-putting. It's like a chemically, locker room disinfectant smell or something. I have never experienced a body wash that changes smell after being lathered, but I could not use it after a few washes. It literally makes me nauseous.	-1
This rice may be quick but it has an awful chemical smell from what ever they use to preserve it. I rinsed it well with water before microwaving it and still yuck. The Minute rice boxed brand is much better and just as quick without the funky preservative smell.	-1
From start to finish, preparation is quick and easy.  It looks like rice, but it has a chemical taste that I just cannot get past.  It's essentially MRE rice packed under a name brand.  Great item for an emergency, but I wouldn't keep it around for anything beyond that purpose.  Personally, I will be sticking with the minute/quick rice varieties.	-1
I don't consume a TON of almond milk, so I'm not that worried about a small amount of food grade carrageenan. Still, I wasn't wild about this almond milk. It had an odd color and it was a bit more watery than most I've purchased. It also  had kind of a funny taste. The package said "roasted", but it seemed a bit sour and bitter compared to other brands I've purchased. I used some in blueberry muffins and the taste was kind of off. I probably wouldn't buy this again unless there was no other option.	-1
Kettle makes good chips.  But this sea salt & vinegar just doesn't work for me.  Too bitter.	-1
Too sour for me!	-1
Not much salt/vinegar taste.  They arrived all crushed up.  Will not order their product again.	-1
Bag was crushed by a case of V8 energy drinks packaged with it.	-1
horrible	-1
too much salt	-1
Just a bit too salty tasting for me.	-1
little flavor	-1
package wet.	-1
not my thing	-1
Way too spicy and hot, didn't taste any lime.	-1
price a typo? over $10 for a half-size bag of chips? check others nearby, any brand: twice as much about $2.25	-1
I bought these thinking they would be tortilla chips with a hint of lime and chili flavor. These chips are very heavily seasoned (more of a Dorito style chip than a tortilla chip). The flavor is good but overpowering if you intend to use these chips with any type of dip.  Unfortunately most of the chips that I buy through amazon arrive broken or smashed.  PROS: Organic chips Reputable brand Nice crunch  CONS: Too much seasoning Chips through Amazon often arrive broken	-1
all six cans dented. I hope i can get my can opener around the dents..	-1
Disappointed with some of the ingredients. It doesn't smell or taste like a lemon. From now on I will buy actual, fresh lemons.	-1
don't like it at allllll tastes like plastic and fake	-1
compared to the real thing its not close, tried to make eggs benedict with it and the hollandaise sauce turned out very bitter. I think they probably squeeze complete lemons in here peel, seeds and all because they are bitter. Ok in tea but i wouldnt cook with it	-1
Awful taste!!  Not right!	-1
There was something not quite right about this item.  I know it is supposed to be an authentic taste as it would be with a "real" lemon, however I felt like there was almost a chemical taste to this, perhaps it was derived from the little bottle it was in. I would personally not purchase this item again, I prefer the taste of real lemons (fresh lemons) and will opt for that over this brand again.	-1
Really thought this was bigger.	-1
I am sure the product is fine but at least one bottle emptied in the Pantry box and made a sticky mess of the rest of the order.	-1
not worth the price	-1
I love ReaLemon and I purchase it all the time. I mis-read the label though. This is quite expensive when compared to the 32 ounce bottle in my local area. I won't be purchasing this again as I am able to get twice as much for the same price. READ the LABELS so you're comparison is accurate.	-1
My bottle was all mangled and I did not try it but lime juice was fine a real lemon	-1
Tastes artificial!	-1
To sweet. No like real Lemons.	-1
Thin,not useful,tear up quickly	-1
Tastes artificial.	-1
All the cans arrived dented. Very disappointed.	-1
Not the best sliced peaches out there.  Usually will find some very soft peaches inside with some bruises.  I really hate lite syrup but in a pinch I will eat anything.  Hit or miss on having good peaches with strong flavor.	-1
My husband continually asks me to buy this soap for him.  For some reason, he likes it.  But since this is MY review, and not his, I will tell you why I HATE THIS SOAP.  It's the most drying soap I have ever seen.  He has SEVERE dry skin on his hands and about a quarter of the way up his forearm - the area he washes when washing his hands.  And it's not just dry skin - it literally looks like he is growing a fine layer of soap in the crevices of his skin.  You feel his skin, and it has an odd...well...soapy feel.  This is just on the hands, but because he washes his hands often during the day (well, when need be...) this is what it causes.  He also uses this soap to bathe with, but since that's just once a day you don't notice a terrible effect.  However, I have run out of body wash a few times and been forced to use his soap before I could get to the store, and it LITERALLY leaves you feeling like you have a layer of soap scum on your skin.  Like you haven't rinsed, even when you have.  Like you need to scrape your skin down with a razor.  Really, it's bad.  Now, onto something that bothers me even more - the literally scum this soap lives in the sink and shower.  It's the worst soap I have ever had to clean up after.  After two days of not cleaning the sink, there is a visible and DURABLE layer of soap scum throughout.  Same with the tub.  He also uses it in the kitchen, and it doesn't seem to have the same effect on the stainless steel, at least.  But this soap is extremely difficult to clean up - I often have to scrub my bathroom with SOS pads just to remove the soap scum - and it's not because I go for weeks without cleaning, it's because this soap is terrible.  Smells great.	-1
This isn't for women although I've used it. I don't ever want to see this again . I'm not bashing the product but it smells too masculine .	-1
I thought ordering some of my groceries through Amazon Pantry was going to be a great idea....boy was I wrong.  Out of the 39 canned good items I ordered 24 of those cans are dented; some pretty badly.  I ordered 4 cans of corn, 2 are dented.  I will be ordering any more canned good items from Amazon.  :(	-1
The item is good the cans arrived dented.	-1
Dented	-1

Very weak tasting . They were so soggy plus barely could taste any pear flavor. I've had (canned pears) before and they have tasted much better than this brand. They were firmer too. I would not recommend this product.	-1
Hard and faultless	-1
Good product. Only two stars because I was very disappointed with how the dispenser functioned. I'm not sure why but I couldn't get it to pump out smoothly. So I ended up just pouring the stuff out.	-1
I heard this works to clean your dishwasher, it did a horrible job, i didn't notice any difference. Im not sure what else borax can be used for.	-1
Didn't work very well. Noticed no difference when not used.	-1
Edible, but has the consistency of dog food.  Better to learn to make your own!	-1
The chili has a good flavor but it seems to induce indigestion in many of those who consume it in anything but small amounts.  Don't know if it is the grease or the spice.  Not many other choices other than n Nalleys.  Bush the bean maker used top make a very good chili but it has disappeared from all sources I can find.	-1
I tried this after using Shout or Oxyclean for a long time.  I wasn't impressed.  My son plays baseball and his pants and shirt are really dirty or grass stained (he plays centerfield).  Shout and Oxyclean do OK but I was looking for something better.  Spray and Wash did a worse job and didn't get out any of the grass stains.  It removed the dirt but the grass stains are the hardest.  I also tried Resolve with no avail either.  Spray and Wash doesn't perform to the standard that Shout or Oxyclean do.  I haven't found that perfect stain remover yet but Spray and Wash is at the bottom of my list.	-1
I was excited to see gf progress soup!  Unfortunately,  there is modified food starch,  and they didn't  specify from corn, so I'm thinking it was wheat derived.  My gut started hurting me shortly after I ate it,  so if you are Celiac, or gluten sensitive,  I would not take a chance.	-1
Soup is decently priced at $1.25 p/can but current price of $1.99 is ridiculous.  Amazon needs to get its act together on their pricing policies and put an end to the huge price swings that plague too many of their grocery products.	-1
Mostly just tomato sauce	-1
THE IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I RECEIVED IN THE MAIL. SUPER DISAPPOINTED	-1
Didn't do a thing for a day old stain.	-1
Honestly, I am normally an Oxi-Clean Stain Remover kind of momma because other than me it's an all male household. Clothes normally never make it through a half day without some kind of mess. With that said, there was a great Prime Pantry deal so I scored a bottle of this. It works well on lighter stains, but anything set in or heavy duty I'll just stick with Oxi. I did find it works well with carpet stains, I pretreated with it before I ran my carpet machine over. So overall, wouldn't recommend for laundry but great for carpet spot treatments.	-1
Not for me.	-1
This does have all the fiber you need in it but unfortunately it tastes horrible.	-1
Is exactly what it tastes like! Looks like animal food. Tastes like cardboard. Disgusting!  Trying to find a recipe where I can eat it with. Bought it because it said 'no sugar', but it should have just said: 'no taste', or 'tastes like cardboard'	-1
Nasty ... i really didn't like this at all..	-1
Cereal box flattened & open. Inside contents exposed ! ! !	-1
Don't bother!!!  Try L O C Amway  Blood. grass and Ink stains easily removed..	-1
HAD HOLE IN BOTTOM OF BOTTLE.  LEAKED ALL OVER CANNED GOODS, PUDDING, RICE. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ON THE BOX.	-1
I do not remember honey nut chez tasting like this. Bring back the gluten, this tastes awful. Blech.	-1
This cereal was the best until they recently changed it.  First, they reduced the chocolate, but not the sugar.  Second and third, they reduced the net weight and increased the price.  Amazon price is twice supermarket price and supermarket price was increased.  Gluten-free is great, but consumers want less sugar (and no corn-syrup, which this cereal claims).  And more chocolate.  Reduce the sugar and increase the chocolate please.	-1
I thought we would give it a try.  It was a good deal, but the fake chocolate has a bitter taste.  We prefer the regular Rice Chex.	-1
Dented cans	-1
Every single can of these chinto Tomatoes were dented, severely	-1
Had a stale taste, don't remember it being like this but the package was sealed and in date. Won't purchase again, too many others on the market.	-1
This is not nearly as good as fiber One 80 Honey squares \ Which are no longer being made. Too bad as that was the best cereal I ever ate!	-1
I'm cleaning up an older relative's kitchen and trying to establish if it is safe to eat their products. They don't have dates on the products I am looking at. Cento doesn't answer the customer service phone, you speak to a machine. If you have a question like is this safe to eat you are out of luck.  You leave a message and might as might as well tie a note to a squirrel and let it loose in the woods. Cento customer service apparently doesn't care about your familys safety enough to get back to you.	-1
Rock hard	-1
Obviously the product was old and past it's best date. Disappointing.	-1
I really wanted to love these chews but I just don't.  There are a few good things They are each only 20 calories but since they are large, for me, just half of one is plenty. The ingredients are just cane sugar, ginger, and tapioca starch, so that's a nice change. They are too spicy for me to enjoy though, and I have thrown each one away before finishing it because I just couldn't handle the heat on my tongue. This is a small bag, just 3 ounces, so there are only about fourteen pieces per bag. I can't recommend them	-1
These are definitely an acquired taste.	-1
These candies are too hot for me.	-1
These rice bars are absolutely disgusting. I couldn't even finish one out of the whole box and I've tried to fob them off on friends, but  no one else likes them either. Yuck.	-1
My daughter would eat these after first bite.	-1
Maybe it's just my tastes. I'm pretty picky about chocolate tastes. I couldn't get myself to even finish a bar, but I gave the rest of the box to my father and he didn't have anything negative to say (though he also didn't ask for more either)	-1
WAY TOO SWEET!  I wanted something organic instead of Heinz and decided to try this.  It tastes syrupy and we just threw away the whole bottle.  It was a bad experience for sure.	-1
I hate this ketchup. I never thought I would say something so heartless about the wonder that is ketchup. This has like cloves and a few other spices that just make my mouth feel icky! It's a weird flavor and I don't like it! I actually threw it out after attempting to use it a couple of times. My husband doesn't like it either and he has VERY different tastes from me. I do not recommend buying this (obviously).	-1
Little one got sick of these quickly.... NO FIBER.... I should have checked the ingredients first	-1
The filling was too sweet. The outside was nearly tasteless and like gooey cardboard-yuk!	-1
Very crummy and dry. You might find a better option than these if you are looking for a way for your toddler not to get messy.	-1
Not much fruit in them, you can barely see it much less taste the fruit	-1
Much better deal at Costco - I was shocked when I opened-up my prime delivery box and saw how small the box was	-1
package was damaged- box was like wet and falling apart at the borrom	-1
Paid $$17.88 w/tax for Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Pumpkin Granola Cereal, 11.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)  I do not recommend buying: I did not like the taste and how crunch it felt. The only reason I bought this was due to the $10 Citi promo otherwise, I will not be buying this again.	-1
This is not very good for anyone A Organic cereal isn't all bad for you , huh?pumpkin and flax seeds pack 5 g of fiber and 6 g of protein as well as 450 mg of omega-3 fatty acids per -cup serving. But think about this it at 260 calories, 10 g of fat (1.6 g saturated), and 10 g of sugar, it's far from the best choice to start your day!	-1
its hard as a rock, and it taste ok.  My baby is teething but he seems to not care for it and he eats everything but that.	-1
My son wouldn't eat these and when I tried them I knew why. They taste like cardboard.	-1
My baby wouldn't eat this product, and neither would the dog. My baby liked holding the teething biscuit but she wouldn't actually chew on it for more than a few seconds. She dropped it on the floor and our dog usually eats most things, but he sniffed it and then moved on.	-1
I wanted to like this product because it is supposed to be healthier. I didn't. Flakes were too big to be used for anything. Not a fan and won't be ordering again. Ended up throwing it out.	-1
It's sweet, packed with seeds that get stuck in your throat, doesn't taste at all of pumpkin, and filling after a couple teaspoons. Wouldn't buy again.	-1
Maybe my expectations were wrong because I thought this coconut was awful.  I love Bob's product and thought I would try this coconut, since it had great reviews.  I thought it was dry and lacked flavor so I sent it back.	-1
I ordered this unsweetened coconut to use in a homemade trail mix.  I love fresh coconut, but not the work involved, so I thought this would be the next-to-best thing.  The coconut is almost tasteless.  I now have 3 1/2 bags left that I will probably never use.  Anyone want to buy 3 unopened bags of tasteless coconut?	-1
I thought that this flaked coconut would be finer, maybe more shredded..I didn't mind the fact it was unsweetened, but I found it did not have much flavor and it  was much larger pieces.. more like it was chipped.. and I really don't know what to do with it now that I have it..Don't think I will order it again..	-1
Lots of mess in this bag.  I got tired of trying to take out dark, damaged pieces.  The rice was maybe old and much crumbled easily and didn't cook well.  I threw out the rest of the bag.  Maybe I got the bottom of a barrel here but it's not the first time this brand has really let me down.  I think of myself as being able to make sushi rice fairly consistently, but not with this brand.  I hate spending an hour picking through a few cups of rice before it's washed and then finding so much more in the process of washing it.  It makes me dread cooking the rice and makes for a sore neck and back in the process.	-1
It says light sodium, we received it and it was 530 sodium. For someone that has kidney disease we have to watch the sodium. and that is not light at all. so I will donate it.	-1
Product had no taste.  Felt as if I were eating soft cardboard.  Needed more spices	-1
Tastes like poop. I have to eat low sodium products, but I expet them to be a lot tastier than this stuff.	-1
This is awful. Somehow it's sweet and it tastes like nothing. It smells like onion, even though there doesn't appear to be any onion in it. I thought it would taste much better than this, and it definitely did not. I wish I had put some salt in it. At least it would have had flavor.	-1
Was between this & the plain jane 'multibran' variety during a Warehouse firesale, and am upset I went against previous experience (& thus my instinct) & went for these. The addition of raisins means you get less bran, since they're packaged by weight, and that you also can look forward to some tooth strengthening.	-1
Not a bad cereal or a bad option, but it's a misnomer/hyperbolic name for a cereal...there aren't many pumpkin seeds or raisins, and the crunch comes from the relatively bland bran. Canceled my S&S immediately; wish I'd tried one box before I sprang for 6.	-1
Taste like poo.	-1
These pieces of dried fruit look like they might have started out as apricots, but they are mostly brownish-black with a few spots of brownish-orange.  They look like the fruit was allowed to over ripen before being dried, and they taste that way too: so over ripened as to be almost nothing but a little fiber with fructose and no flavor of apricots whatsoever.  If you're looking for a soft, very sweet dried fruit with little real flavor of its own to add sweetness to a dish, these will be just the thing.  If you're looking for dried apricots that actually taste like apricots, give these a very wide berth.  A few astronomical units should do.	-1
