These are well built and pair nicely with the 3-ton All-in-one bottle jack.	1
as advertised and expected	1
I drive a car with well over 200,000 miles on it. I frequently end up under it trying to break bolts free. These stands easily and securely hold the weight of the car. The extra pin to lock the stands in position gives you that extra piece of mind when trying to get those stubborn bolts. A quality set of stands are a must for anyone who works on cars and these are a nice safe set.	1
work great love them!	1
Looks strong enough to me to hold 6000 lbs.  I don't care about the cosmetic part of the welding that doesn't look a fine delicate product.  Laser welding would make a product look really pretty but will also cost more.	1
Looks and works great. People complain about the welds looking sloppy - and they are but, so are the welds on my Craftsman jack stands that I have had for a few years now and have used plenty of times without failing. I would not consider the set of Jack stands I received unsafe because of the welds.	1
First one had defects....second one looks fine, but still not a quality product. Customer service had no idea about their product. Nice that I could returned to Amazon.	-1
Well made, very solid, good height range, holding up my 4500 pound car for a year now with no issues. Am not afraid to work under car.	1
They do their job just fine. I've used them only a couple of times and have been very useful for me.	1
Excellent stands.  Rely on them often.	1
Arrived on time. Work well. Very safe. I now have two sets. Use them almost daily.	1
Great price and like the locking pin.	1
These are very nice high quality jack stands.  When these are under my car, I do not worry about them failing.  The safety pin is also a nice feature for double assurance.  I am very impressed with the jack stands and recommend them to anyone.	1
They work great.	1
Felt very secure with these jacks under my truck. Used them both to lift the back of my 2011 Toyota Tundra while I installed some Air Lift air bags. Never once felt like these were putting me in danger. The double locking is an absolute must. Peace of mind knowing there is a pin through the middle of them.	1
working well so far	1
These have helped me keep my 2003 GMC Yukon XL Denali safe as I use the hydraulic jack.  The are sturdy and easy to use and "lock" once the car is raised with the "key".  Nice paint job and good looking welds.	1
I use these to supplement other stands. These are adjustable to different heights that the others are not. Light, very stable for my use. I use at least 2 jacks per wheel when I work on my 86 Chev.	1
Good quality for the price.	1
used this pair of jacks many times now for oil change, feels so much safer under the vehicle when theres safety pin on the jackstand.	1
They seem very durable held up front end of 2003 Toyota Camry for over 6 months with no problems	1
Excellent.	1
AAA	1
Works and looks great	1
Feel cheap but heald my Ranger up no problem	1
returned	-1
These are what you want when looking for sturdiness and safety. The double locking feature is the only way to go. Easy to lock and adjust. The construction is very sturdy and not some cheap feeling metal. If you are looking for jack stands this is what you want.	1
worked great	1
After reading some reviews on the bad spot welding and the pins not fitting.... but also seeing a lot of 'great' reviews, decided to buy it and hope I got a good set, as I was looking for a double lock feature... as I needed to just raise the front end of my SUV...  Well.... after getting these, saw that the welding was about 50/50 on each jack stand, as in half good, half questionable. And, I have a 2-ton jack stand, and they seemed to be about the same gauge steel used on the frame.. hmmm..  On one stand, the safety pin, barely goes under the jaw of the stand(see picture), it was straight, but only about 1-2mm under the jaw.. the other stand, was a different story. The pin was offset. as soon as you put the pin in, you could see how crooked it was, so it engaged under the jaw halfway in.  I decided to give them a test under my trailblazer.. as soon as I lowered my vehicle onto it, I never heard stands make metal cracking noise... made me worry about even getting under the vehicle... I was changing out some front wheel bearing, so wasn't going under... I ended up putting my 2-ton stand next to these, my front tires I took off under the frame of the vehicle AND the hydraulic jack just pressed against the frame to make sure.. I had to get my axle bearing replaced and it was late, so no other stores were open...  Anyways, these are going back... and I ended picking up a pair of 3-ton craftsman jack stands, on sale(cheaper) the next day! They were more heavy duty looking and the welding was all around good on it.. they didn't creek when I lowered the SUV onto it... it didn't have the 'safety' pin on it like I was looking for, but, I've been using jack stands without it anyways, just thought this was a good feature...if it was done right...	-1
Sturdy. Works well.	1
Shipped quick and just as described.  Thanks!	1
Work great and seem to be made well.  The pins do get annoying though.	1
Perfe	1
Excellent. Thank you.	1
as advertized.	1
Have not had to use them yet but am pleased with the quality.	1
Worked fine when I used it today but these don't have a notch to use on cars were you put the on a pinch welded rail.  They felt solid during the "push test" despite this.	1
good deal!	1
Good Jack stands.	1
These jack stands are very high quality.  Nicely made.  If this is the support capability and lift requirement for you, these are the stands.  Safety 'lock' as well.	1
It's hit and miss on these jack stands.  I bought my pair at Northern for a cheaper price.  As in any load carrying safety equipment you're best to open the box right there in the store and examine each closely,  which I did and four boxes later I was able to piece together a decent pair.  The other problem is how well the "teeth"  are designed and the catch,  if not cut and formed properly these present a dangerous problem too.  Problem with online ordering of such items is you cannot do this,  I  would recommend purchasing such critical  items in person.  There is little quality control in the cutting and welding process of making these as shown.  I own many various pairs of stands and one of my favorite is a pair of chromed goodyears I picked up at a local wholesale club,  6 ton. When shopping look for a broad base for superior stability,  heavier, wide base generally means low center of gravity. ...thus not easy to tip.  Check the welds for penetration into the metal-not laying on top or the other extreme holes blown though in spots into the metal used...smooth even "puddles"  laid down straight and penetrated into the metal.  Slag and splatter spots are usually found on cheaper quality stands like these,  your higher end better quality stands are made with well prepared surfaces,  smooth penetrated welds with splash spots etc ground off/removed.  They are constructed using welding material with higher strength than typical low end mild steel...example is low hydrogen weld.  So,  sort though if in person,  piece together a decent pair.... if ordering beware some of these pictures look really,  really bad on the welds.  Always use more than needed stands,  they are meant to take the load off the jack after lifting.  What I do is always position extra,  once load is on stand I release load slowly off the jack,  repositioning if needed then "snug" it up to a supporting spot where it's not loaded but able to act as a secondary backup.  I know it's overkill,  but it's nice to know there is extra there and the jack too.  Work safely my friends and I hope this helped.	-1
I purchased these 3 ton jack stands for general use inside my garage. I use them for auto repairs. I also use them as long-term jack stands to keep my enclosed trailer elevated off the ground to save the tires and help prevent theft. Amazon had the lowest price I could find and shipping was quick.	1
great units	1
Can't have enough of these.	1
Very good purchase for peace of mind regarding safety with the 6 ton capacity and locking feature.  Cautionary note:  Since these are taller than some stands, you'll need to be sure that your jack will lift your vehicle high enough for these stands.  My jack just barely does this at full extension.	1
worked great on my 12,000 pound motorhome, when I was changing the suspension air bags.	1
Heavy duty, great quality and value!	1
great product for a great price too, I love it!	1
Good jacks will help with my truck and boat if I need to change a tire.	1
good and solid	1
Everything stated by seller was correct.  Both stands did not sit flush with floor, both rocked.	1
The jacks are very sturdy and I do take some comfort in their ability to lock when I'm working under my truck.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again	1
Made very well I thought who knows why they were made in USA they are not. Just what I was looking for.	1
Look good and hold my '69 Mustang up with no issue.	1
Looks well made and plenty heavy duty enough for my Ford Focus.  You may want to step up to 3 ton jack stands for SUV or trucks.	1
best jack stands I've used to date and have no doubt on the quality.  held up a 2011 silverado and a 93 MR2 without issue.	1
work great. Use them as stabilizers for popup camper.	1
My car has not yet fallen off the stands, painfully crushing me to death.  When it does, I'll reduce the rating.  Giving it five stars.  I've been using the pair of stands with a mid-sized sedan and an SUV without problems.	1
Item as described, very niece. Arrived in reasonable time.	1
I own a Miata and had my shocks fail on me.. so I got stupid and bought a coilover kit, and once the overexcited mechanics installed the coilovers I lost the ability to work or raise the car (yeah don't mess around with your stock settings on your miata trust me..keep it stock...)  anyway raised the car back closer to it's stock height but still had a real hard time changing oil on my car and I do not feel safe working on a car without extra jacks...so it was pretty hard to find one that could fit under the fender on a low setting but these jack stands are great... work flawless... cheap and high quality.  Great product!	1
Just what I expected.	1
I saw this product, and it was really worth the Buck!!I I recommend this for your home I think this is the best price on Amazon.	1
Great jack stands. Strong and reliable. Nice price.	1
good quality, I'll have these forever	1
The welds certainly do look a little sloppy, but hopefully they'll hold up well.  The double locking feature is a great thing to have!	1
Great for the price. Especially since oil changes only happen once every few months.	1
Cheap quality. Buy the stands where a pin slides through!	-1
These jack stands are heavy duty - cannot believe they shipping was free!!  They are well built and I have already put them to use.	1
they hold things up when I put them down.	1
I love them. They are durable and good price	1
Great quality and the locking pin is a nice feature.  The shiny red color helps to soothe your anxiety as you pretend not to notice the car sitting in your garage that you've taken apart but forgot how to put back together.  Since the jack stands will likely become a permanent feature of your garage, sitting mightily under your car, the locking pin will ensure they stay stubbornly in place.	1
Good sturdy jackstand.	1
I have not used these at the present time, they appear as they are very well made & should do the job without any problem, shipping was Excellent. I have purchased many items on amazon and they have all performed excellent for Me.	1
Excellent buying experience! The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely. The price was also the best on the internet, too. Great item, exactly what I wanted! Highly recommend both this item and the seller. Thanks very much!	1
There is much discussion about welds and chinese made jacks. However I have yet to see a photo, from the many online forums discussing the matter, of a jack that has cracked from these bad welds. I've actually seen photos of the sliding head cracking or the vehicle falling off the jack because of incorrect placement.  I feel people are over analyzing a relatively simple tool, rather than analyzing their mistakes when using them.  With this out of the way, I ordered these to use on my car and have had no issues using them for oil changes, tire rotations and so on. The pin is an added benefit...piece of mind if you will and avoids user mistake of not clicking the head into the right position.	1
Good purchase, does the job as intended.	1
works as needed	1
These are the most solid pieces of Jack stands I've used. The quality is awesome. The teeth don't shake, have good grip. Paint is well applied, durable and good quality. HAS STOP BARS for extra safety! This is a great measure. Usually jack stands don't come with extra bars like this. I ordered twice.	1
They hold up my 03 accord.	1
this is my second pair of jack stands, and were bought specifically for its double locking feature which i thought would give me some extra piece of mind when doing a recent engine rebuild (nobody wants to be crushed by a car...)  Unfortunately, the holes through which the double-locking bars are placed were partially blocked with what looked like splattered welding material, and it took quite a bit of grinding to make the bars fit again. because of this, 4 stars seems just.	1
These are the best. Worth way more than what they are selling for. Double locking pins and 3 tons?! These are a must have if you work on vehicles in your garage.	1
Great jacks for the price and have had no issues with them!	1
These jack stands are very light weight and made me a little nervous when I first got them, but it turns out they're pretty durable. Granted, I use it to hold up a Ford Ranger, not an 18 wheeler, but I've been pleased with how sturdy and stable they are. Bottom line, my truck hasn't fallen on me and crushed me yet - so they're alright by me.	1
These are excellently priced jack stands at a very attractive price.  The locking key is nice feature that I didn't have on the 2-ton jack stands that I paid much more money for from a big box store.	1
Work great.  Very solid.  Wish something could be built in the USA though.	1
Works great.	1
This is very good product it fits my needs.	1
I bought these to hold each side of my 24' powerboat up (one side at a time) while changing the brakes. They held the load very nicely.	1
As mentioned by others not the best welding job but they didn't seem dangerous just a bit messy.  Great budget jack stands for the 2 or 3 times a year the midsize suv needs to be lifted.	1
Well made item !	1
Very sturdy  and reasonably priced ... What more can one say???	1
Good price.  Decent height adjustment and easy to use.	1
you could hold a tank up with these	1
Great item for the price. I liked the added protection of having the double lock feature.	1
Build quality is very good, They can support heavy truck and they goes high enough, but please don't buy them for a sedan type of car, or a crossover SUV with low ground clearance.	1
Wow!!! Really BAD welds!!!!! The other reviewers were NOT kidding....I'm going to rework these welds when I get a chance. Too bad, because the locking pin is a great feature and that's why I will keep these around instead of returning.  I can honestly tell you that there was no quality inspection performed here and I would not trust these jacks without something else under the car. Other Torin products I own were decent. These are NOT.	-1
These are great and easy to use.  I really like the locking style because it's easy to use.	1
Excellent build quality and price.	1
These stands are plenty sturdy for the weight of the vehicles that I have. the double lock feature is really nice added insurance.  the only problem for me is that they are not quite tall enough for my 1941 Packard; a couple of homemade platforms built from 4x4s and 3/4 plywood took care of that. They do support the car just fine, and are plenty tall enough for my 2007 Volvo S60.	1
Work great for my 2 vehicles. makes doing oil changes and tire rotations a snap. I will probably be buying another set to compliment this set	1
I would not hesitate to recommend these jack stands, as I have had very good results and they seem to be very well made.  The double lock is an absolutely mandatory feature in my estimation.  You should always use the jack stands with the double lock in place, as it adds additional security.  I am pleased with the height of the stands as well, as it is possible to raise the vehicle up a considerable amount, making it easy to get in and work.  I replaced the front suspension on my vehicle in an afternoon using these stands and they never wavered.  I went out and replaced the rear shocks, springs, and fuel filter the next day.  Once again, the stands were steady and solid while I pushed, shoved, wedged, etc. the rear springs into place.  I am very pleased with these stands and definitely recommend them.	1
Great product & good price I pick up another set. Delivery was fast & packaging was good would say to anyone buy it if you need a affordable 6 ton jack.	1
Clarification of Maximum height based on model There are 4 Different models of this Jack Stand, only 3 are listed on amazon.  T42002A = 2 Ton - Lifting Range 10-13/16 to 16-9/16 inches (27.5cm - 42cm) T43002A = 3 Ton - Lifting Range 11-1/4 to 16-3/4 inches (28.6cm - 42.6cm) T46002A = 6 Ton - Lifting Range 15-1/2 to 23-15/16 inches (39.5cm to 60.8cm) T412002A = 12 Ton - Lifting Range 18-5/16 to 28-1/8 inches (46.5cm to 71.5cm)  Note: This information is directly from the User Manual shipped with product.	1
These are well built quality stands.  The feature of the pin to ensure the stand can not drop is nice.  Helps make a dangerous situation safer	1
So far they do a good job. No complaints. I'd recommend it to everyone. Good overall quality and reasonable price.	1
Built well, and were well packaged. Great stands for the price. They work well for my 2003 TJ and my 1990 K5	1
I use them and I like them... though since they seem to be made from painted carbon steel do not let them stand in the garage floor over winter. They will most likely begin to rust. I sprayed a bit of rubberized undercoating on them to at least prevent rust for a while	1
So far they haven't dropped my jeep on my face. That is all I can ask of jack stands.  I've not seen any rust so far.	1
Bought these to support my nearly 9,000 lb pickup while changing out my front and rear suspension.  Worked great.  Good height.  Nice safety latch.  No issues.	1
I really like the double locking feature as a backup incase the release lever got kicked or something. These stands also have a pretty good lift range. The welds aren't the best like others have pointed out but that's just what you're going to get at this price point. I'll probably reweld them at some point but for now they still far exceed my needs.  I bought the 6 ton stands because while I'm not certain they're strong enough to support 6 tons (3 tons each of course) they are definitely strong enough to support any normal vehicle. Remember that the weight of the vehicle is divided up amongst the stands. With the exception of the very biggest configuration of the very biggest 1 ton diesel pickup available most big non-commerical trucks weigh less than 1 ton per corner so even if these stands can only manage a third of their rated weight they are still overkill for most trucks let alone cars.  Basically the welds should be better but these things are still very strong and perfectly fine for normal passenger vehicles.	1
I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.  I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.  It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.  Min. Lift Height (in.)  14 29/32 Max. Lift Height (in.)  23 1/2	1
What I really like about these is the locking bar.  Most inexpensive stands do not have the add safety feature of a locking bar.  These are quality items that make me feel very safe working under a car	1
The Honda dealer wanted over $1,000 to replace the back shocks on my S2000. I bought these and a few tools totaling under a $100 and saved $500 by DIY.  That makes these a winner. Mike	1
I had two different mechanics inspect the welds and neither one said they would get under a vehicle with these jacks.	-1
Exactly what I paid for. They look of great quality though I haven't used yet. I'm sure they will perform.	1
These work great.  I have the 2 ton and the 3 ton versions.  Inexpensive but do the trick.  Highly recommended	1
the dip in the support bar is not too deep (this is a super important point some people overlook) has the extra safety pin - can never be too safe and this is primary reason why this is BEST price around. for me, is about 2 dollars cheaper shipped than for same pair without the pins from that W-M store taking over the world. getting another pair soon. if you need a pair, come n get it, prolly makes a great gift for anyone wanting to fix cars.  Edit: Note, one of my locking pins was difficult to put into the slot, put a little lube, did a little squeeze and now works just fine. probably the alignment between the two slots were slightly off ... all so very slightly. As far as bad welds? mine looked normal, did even compare to same rated set from WM without the extra pins. The pins aren't essential but nice.	1
Torin T43002A 3 ton double locking jack stands.  I know of other individuals that have use these and I decided that I needed them too	1
I have other 3 tons and these are by far the best, im looking to get 2 of the 6 ton models as well!	1
Not much to say, they do what they were made to do! For the price there is nothing to complain about.	1
You'd better trust your Jack Stands if you have any intention of getting under your car. I thought these were a good option but I changed my mind after receiving them... For whatever reason, justified or not, I felt uneasy seeing how much they rattle. I decided to take my car to the mechanics and ended up never using them. I forgot to return them and then it was too late...  So two stars because they do not inspire me any confidence.	-1
easy to use, very solid. the double locking is a great feature but is kind of over kill. Love it!	1
Torin T46002A 6 Ton Double Locking Jack Stands (Sold in Pairs) works as expected . Little bit of an overkill for what I need , but once you have a car fall on you you become a little more careful .	1
I just finished my first job with these, using them to support a mid-sized car.  They struck me as over-built in sturdiness, which is a big plus in my opinion. And I like that they store compactly, so I saved the box they came in as an easy way to store them in a compact space.	1
I wanted a higher rating for my garage jack stands since they will be holding the Beast up while I scurry about underneath.  These fit the billl.  The safety bar gives me a little extra confidence and the welds look OK to my untrained eye.	1
These are of great quality and have perfect welds on every single unit I have. I purchased two sets of the 6 ton and one set each of the 2 and 3 ton. ALL, every single unit, has perfect welds.  These are safe and I highly recommend them. To the people saying they are not safe, you simply received a bad run, but as of today 02/18/2014 all 8 individual units I have are perfect and I have been working under them woth peace of mind for the last week. Why not re-order? Every product has a few bad apples. Actually, even if the weld on these were not perfect(they are on mine) unless you went far over the rated weight I just cant see how these could possible fail, they are solid and stable.  It's simple, if you do get one with a bad weld just replace it free using Amazon. These are as good as my older 80.00-100.00 units and I will not spend 80.00 on jack stands ever again!  I will re-rate these in several months, but I don't see anything changing. For now 5 stars  6, 3 and 2 ton preference:  Without question my favorite are the 6 ton, they are so beefy and are always my first choice. They are a bit too tall for the sides of my 2000 Monte Carlo though.  If the 6 ton are too tall as they are for my 2000 Monte(on the sides at least) and you are trying to decide between the 2 and 3 ton 100% go for the 3 ton. In my experience, at least for this jack stand line, there is nothing the 3 ton won't fit that the 2 ton will and the difference in build quality is substantial. Since the price difference is only 4.00 pass on the 2 ton, the 3 ton are far better and only 1.5" total taller. I am not sure why they even make a 2 ton, I guess for the people who want to save 4.00, but the diff in price is not worth the durability difference. I suggest to pay the 4.00. Or maybe there are cars where the 1.5" does makes a difference, but any jack I have ever used goes higher than the lowest setting on the 2 and 3 ton jack stands by several inches, even on the sides of a low vehicle. I consider my car very low and the 3 ton work fine. Obviously I prefer the 3 ton over the 2 by a far margin. Only use the 2 ton if you are forced into it they are simply not the value of the 3 ton stands.	1
They do what you need them to do. I added these to a previous par so I could more easily raise my truck to rotate tires. The previous pair I purchased have been used for 10+ years and are as good as the day I bought them.	1
Used these before and searched out more for home garage use. Currently holding up a gen 1 Miata while I force feed an LS1 into it. No complaints.	1
As usual I base many of my purchases on need AND customer feedback. These Jack Stands are solid, functional, well built. I used them this morning while working on my '94 Suburban. It's nice to have confidence in the tools you use.	1
Very Good Value looking forward to eventually putting them to good use on my jeep liberty hope they work as good as they look	1
These jack stands are awesome. Used them in combination with my Torin T90403 4 Ton Hydraulic Bottle Jack to change my brake pads and oil last week. They are simple to use, keep your safety in mind, and do exactly what they are intended to do. If you need to hold up an elephant or two, your car, or another morbidly obese creature, don't forget to use these Torin Jack Stands!	1
A great value for these stands whose quality is better than expected given the price! Buy and use these - remember the 3 ton rating - with confidence.	1
I just got my 2 in the mail today. UPS has been losing the packages this year during christmas, but after a long wait and a reorder due to losing my packages, I FINALLY have them in my hand. They are beautiful	1
These jack stands are well made and durable.  They are much safer that the older jack stands that I was using.  The double lock feature is sturdy as well.	1
Some things just suprise you when you receive them. These did. Very beefy, heavy duty, well made. Much better for the low price then expected. Would buy again.	1
I use the stands to prevent a 5' by 10' trailer from standing on end.  I put the stands under the end section of the trailer so it does not stand on it end when I walk up the trailer gate to load the trailer.	1
i was skeptical after reading some of the reviews on here but figured for the price it was worth a try, I didn't work underneath the car at first just out of anxiety but after having my G6 up on them and actually working on the tires/brakes a few times I fealt comfortable getting under them. They are very simple to use and very strong.	1
my Jeep is on 33's, this will give you about 1 inch of clearance off ground, good enough for me at the moment, but if you desire more scooching space under go for some 4 ton or 6 ton jacks for a little more cash.	1
Can see the same welding issues as the other users, though I'm not sure if it would affect the maximum load (2 tons) the jack stands can hold. Sturdy jack stands, might be slightly high for some cars, depending on what you are trying to do (being too high isn't awful - you just need to jack your car up a little more).  Overall, simple no frills car jack stands. Has a safety pin mechanism to to keep the jack stand locked, as well as the regular locking handle.	1
Reviewer's car: Hyundai Veloster Turbo  I did not have any problems with these jack stands. However, the lock is very easy to remove, so be aware of that. It did gave my car the support it needed, which these jack stands promised.	1
Got two sets to work on my 1998 Mercury Mountaineer and 2005 Mustang GT. These stands seem well built and I wasn't hesitant to work below my vehicles while they were in place.	1
Good stand for the price. They hold my offroad rig at full extension on the frame no problem, and the double locking feature gives me peace of mind, but still be sure to use other safeguards.	1
After reading some of the reviews that complained about shoddy welding, I couldn't find anything on the two sets (four) of the jackstands that I purchased that seemed to be an issue.  I've had my car on the jackstands a few times and have had no problems whatsoever.  The safety feature is great to make sure the adjustment stays where it needs to be.  Some of you people that "inspect" welds don't know what you're talking about.	1
These looked great. They were packaged kinda funny and banged around a bit, causing a little bit of scratching. They seem well built and overall look like a solid product. The only thing that seems a bit off is the quality of the welds and the thickness of the actual red (A) part of the stand, it's pretty thin. I can only hope it passed destructive testing as is. I look forward to using these. These are a requirement if you need to get the car high enough to pull a tranny.  I'll put it to use then update this at a later time.	1
very good build quality, very sturdy, locking pins make them extra safe! very pleased with my purchase! not cheapo jacks, actually well made!	1
I use these very often. Helps me feel a lot safer when under my truck. They adjust well enough to get under there without much jacking up and jacking down.	1
I bought a set of these thinking they were the same as my 6 ton jack stands.  Luckily, my mistake made my life easier.  I was always that anything less than a 6 ton jack is just too flimsy if you're working on a truck or SUV.  I turns out that these little guys aren't flimsy at all.  And the added lock, while completely unnecessary, does provide a bit of extra reassurance when you're under a vehicle.  I would definitely buy again.	1
I guess maybe some people on here got lemons, but I inspected mine when they came in and all the welds are pretty good. The safety pin is an added piece of insurance, and I always use it. Low enough to fit under my WRX, and tall enough to fit under my Cherokee.	1
For my 1999 Subaru Forester, it does the job as expected. What more can I ask for? Great jack stands.	1
I can't get over this great deal.  They are solid jack stands and make my oil changes a lot safer.  Would recommend these to anyone looking for good jack stands.	1
Can't say much about these jacks other than they work as described. Easy to use and they seam very sturdy with a nice wide platform. I do feel safe with these under my car when working on it. I thought they were priced very well too.	1
I've been climbing around under cars since 1959 and these jack stands are sweet.  One can drop a four wheel drive on these puppies and they're not going flex.  Or one can get their sports car up to a "DECENT" working height of a shade under twenty-four inches.  It doesn't matter if these have a capacity of six tons each or they're six tons for two of them because they're shipped and you're going use them......as a pair.  Our full size F-250, with tool boxes is 8,800 pounds so what do I care if they're not six tons each?  They're going be holding up a single corner or side of the vehicle at a time.  In the meantime, the spec sheet packaged inside the box the jack stands are packed in, clearly spec these jacks at 6T "each."  If you need to be reassured, call the manufacture's customer service line between 8-5 PST @ 1-888-448-6746 and let customer service tell you directly what the truth is regarding any of your questions.  On our jack stand copy, I checked the delivered jack stand base welds and found all gusset welds and manufacturing quality control, to be good to excellent manufacturing/welding.  I checked out the stamped sheet metal parts and found the stamped sheet metal work to be "excellent."  There was nothing in the manufacturing of our jack stands that would seem abnormal (a standout), cheap or inappropriate for a product of this kind.  This is not a high end, tech grade, stainless steel, high pressure fitting where each weld is x-ray'd.  This is a typical red and black jack stand one uses at home or a shop to support a car, pickup, flatbed or box truck for the purpose of safely making repairs under a jacked up vehicle.  Used normally, with safety in mind during proper placement, there's no reason to believe that if you use these jack stands, you won't be able to safely get under a vehicle, make your repairs and get on to the next item on your check list.  Overall, I am very pleased with the pair of auto jacks we received and I feel comfortable recommending these beasts to all who find themselves to be mechanically inclined and in need of safely crawling around under their jacked up vehicle.	1
I ordered these jack stands and have used them several times and haven't had a problem. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the "lock" is kinda cheesy. It's just a pin you slide through and could have been made a more ergonomic design but these things work great regardless.	1
These are great jack stands for the money. They include a safety pin that locks them in place & makes them very safe.	1
A good sturdy jack stand. Supports my Ford F150 with no problem. I like the added locking pin. I would recommend these to anyone looking to support their vehicle while working on it.	1
I don't know what is all the fusses about? For $20, I got a nice pair of jackstands that will take the weigh of my car when I am under it. It is sure hell a lot more stable and secured than the scissor jacks that most of the complainers crawled udner their cars for years. I did not find any problem with the welding for my jacks. If someone wants to have perfect welding on their jacks, I suggest they should be paying x2 or 3x more or do it themselves. I think that my pair of jacks will last my life time even if I used the darned thing every day for the next 50 years but most of the people don't even crawl under their cars more than once a month. If they do, they should invest in another car. I preferred these locking jackstands so there won't be any accident waiting to happen as the jack will not slip on the stand base once I lock it. Once I put either the front or the rear ends of my cars on these jacks and choke the other wheels, the car is not going anywhere. If people need a higher jacks, they should have buy the 3 ton SUV jacks instead. They complained about the wrong jacks because they just don't want to take any responsibility for their own ignorance just like they bitched on the government policy but keep sending idiots to Washington DC.	1
Works as expected.  One of the holes for the locking pin wasn't quite right, but nothing a quick hammer didn't take care of.  I like that these have the locks as my other ones do not lock.	1
I bought these jack stands to replace some older jack stands that I have had for thirty years or more. The new jack stands have a much higher rating than the old ones.  They appear to be much more rugged as well.	1
I had an interesting situation in that I have a high clearance Jeep and a low clearance Toyota Camry.  These jacks can handle both cars very well.  Even at the lowest setting the camry is quite high off the ground.  They are also large, much larger than your typical 3 ton ones.  I wanted heavy duty ones and these are.  I feel safe underneath them.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.	1
These are decent jack stands, particularly at this price point.  They are simple to use and have no problem holding up vehicles up to the 3 ton rating.  One warning -- use them on a durable surface or stick a flat paver underneath them.  The first time I used these stands, their feet were pushed by the weight of the vehicle deep into the asphalt of my driveway.	1
Welp so far so good. I haven't seen any slippage yet. At the same time, I always make sure that the tooth locked up before I put any load on it, just to be extra safe.	1
Worked like a charm to hold up each axle of my BMW E46 3-Series while I was changing the brakes. For the most part, safety wasn't a concern because to change the brakes you don't need to get under the car at all. But for the right-rear brake wear sensor you have to stick your head under where the right passenger door is. The sensor has a long cable that routes through the suspension with lots of clips holding it in place. It's a bit scary sticking your head under a heavy metal object, but with the jack stands holding it up, I had almost no fear.  One bit of advice: Remember that in order to use these jack stands on many cars, you can't lift your car with the jack that came with the car because on many cars there are only two points on either side of the car from which you can lift. And if you're using a jack to lift the car, you have no place to rest the car down onto the jack stands. In order to lift the car onto jack stands you need something like a trolley jack to lift the whole rear end or whole front end of the car. On my car there are frame brackets right near the front and rear differentials (my car is AWD). Place the trolley jack under each of those, lift it up, and drop onto the jack stands. For extra safety, keep the trolley jack under the frame brackets in case something happens.	1
Bought these because I have a deep fear of a car falling on top of me while I'm underneath.  Although I still have a major fear of that, these things do help ease it quite a bit because of the thick and sturdy build quality and the bar thing that locks it in place.  Very heavy duty stands.	1
So some of the reviews for the SUV ones said they were too tall, these aren't tall enough for my Hyundai Santa Fe. They work fine if I'm working on the front but if I jack up the back too the front wheels will touch the ground. That's not a slight against this product I'm just warning others. As for why I dropped a star it's because as others have noted the welding isn't the greatest. On mine the seams looked to go through far enough I feel plenty safe under it. But given what it does you would expect them to make sure the welds are perfect.  Overall I am happy with them and think they are a safe and good product for anyone to use.	1
I had two sets of jack stands but only 1 1/2 tin capacity and when I got my truck, I feel questionable getting under the truck. I know they share the weight but it only takes one to fail... So I ordered two pair of these 3 ton stands. They were securely packed in the box with cover and cushion. I love the double locking safety. Very good construction and ready for use. I highly recommend this product.	1
The ratchet and double pin was set on the lowest height for the first two times. On the third time they were set about 8 inches higher. At this height, the double pin is good insurance. They worked perfectly and I highly recommend them!	1
These jack stands seem to be well made and I like the feature with the safety pin. I bought these to use on an old corvette and they are more than what is required for that purpose. I would have no problem using these on our chevy suburban.	1
These worked perfect for simple brake pad/rotor replacements. They're a little smaller than ones I've used in the past, but they seem to be very sturdy.	1
They work as advertised. I also feel a lot more comfortable under the car know that these have a second locking mechanism preventing the jack stand from retracting when in use.	1
These are clearly not the highest quality product out there but they are functional. 4 stars as long as my car continues to remain off my face during oil changes.	1
These jack stands work well for their intended purpose. I use them mostly for 4 wheelers and side x sides. I really like the fact that they have locking pins. They are sturdy and well built.	1
I have a set of these 3 ton, and also the 2 ton jack stands, both seem well made and are holding up nicely.	1
Very solidly made jack stands.  Use them for doing general maintenance on my cars.  My only negative comment is that the safety pins tend to fall out if you tip the stands when you are carrying them.  Not a big deal.  My guess is that if they were to fit more tightly, I'd be complaining that they were somewhat difficult to remove when adjusting the stand height.	1
I bought two pairs of these jack stands to perform basic maintenance on my cars and have been happy with the purchase. There have been some reviews that have said that these cannot be used on cars which is not true at all. These stands are very tall and while it is not necessary to go with the taller, higher capacity 6-ton model for regular cars that does not mean that they won't work if the car is raised with capable equipment. In my case, I anticipate using these for larger vehicles within the next five to ten years but in the meantime, I regularly use them after raising a sedan and a light SUV with a floor jack. These stands are very solid and the double locks are a nice feature as well. If you are working on larger vehicles or if you're working on smaller vehicles that you are able to raise high enough, these are great stands to have.	1
Even after read all the other post where some people wrote that this products have failures, I take the risk and was very surprised that the stands I recieve came in great shape all was perfect and fits great on both vehicles that I have	1
Heavy duty, no flaws.  Easy to use.  Make sure you bend in the tabs to prevent the insert from falling out later.  These are great.	1
I picked these up for some added safety while doing routine maintenance on my car and I'm very pleased with them. They're very sturdy and extremely well priced. I'll be picking up a second set once the weather breaks. With 4 I won't have to worry at all about the car rolling, because these jacks are so strong and sturdy.	1
good floor jack stands.  Work well. Lift height was not as high as I hoped, but was as advertised. well built	1
the first time I used it out of the box, one stand's neck is broken. I decided this brand is the one I should avoid. And let my friend know it.	-1
These are good jacks for a car or minivan with low ground clearance. Not the heaviest jack stand you'll find, but sturdy enough for cars or minivans and good value at the price.	1
These stands are very well made. They are solid and will be buying two more once i have the money. You cant find a better deal for 3 ton Jack stands. I bought these after realizing that only using a jack to work on a car can be very dangerous. Now, i use the the stands and leave the jack as a precaution.	1
I bought this to jack up my 4Runner. It is sturdy for 3 ton, but a little short for a SUV. So I have to be careful to be sure the chassis bar stay on the top of the jack stand when I lower the jack. Otherwise, it is very good.	1
This product has been working well and I have had no problems with it so far. I would highly recommend this to anyone. This has lasted me quite a while without issues. Would highly recommend	1
Sweet, they are awesome. Very well built and will definatly hold six tons. They are a little tall for a cavilier.	1
I love these jack stands. I am using them to hold up a Nissan Maxima, so they are way way way more than capable of doing that. The reason why I went with these over smaller capacity jack stands was two-fold. Number 1, I also have a Suburban which I will use these on. Number 2, I thought the extra height would be nice.  A note about point #2 - the extra height is nice. BUT keep in mind that you have to get the car that high or higher to get them on the jack stands. That was the tricky part. But once I figured that out, all was good.  These jack stands appear to be well made. I like the double locking feature as it gives me a little more peace of mind. I am actually in need of another set of jack stands and will probably pick up another set of these because I like them so much.  Get them - you won't be disappointed.	1
These stands are solid and have a great locking mechanism. They are smaller than I expected and look like they could possibly tip over if the vehicle is on any sort of an incline. I definately only use them on a flat level surface.	1
These jack stands do what they are supposed to do. My Disco 2 is about 5,000 lbs and they hold it just fine. My only advice is that you make sure you know your vehicle height. These jack stands are tall. I use them on the lowest setting on my Disco and I still have to jack it up an inch or so to get it high enough to put these under. I will be lifting it soon though, so that will change, and hence the reason I got these. For a normal car though, these would probably not be my first choice.  Also, if you are using them on asphalt, be aware that they might sink down into the ground a little. On concrete you wouldn't have this problem, but asphalt is soft enough that the edges of the stands might cut through.  Finally, be safe and get a good pair of wheel chalks to use.	1
As for quality, sure it isn't top notch. But this thing isn't going to fall apart on you, these are tough and will hold. Scared for you life? Than go to a shop. The welding isn't perfect, but you have to realize this is mass produced. The welds aren't going to separate. I would definitely suggest using these in pairs, as in don't leave one alone to hold part of your vehicle. For those with cars, don't worry b/c cars weigh nothing. These are rated for as much as a cars avg weight. The double locking is a nice feature but not necessary on small jobs. My truck weighs over 6k so if these can hold one end, it will hold your average cars then too. If your doing small jobs, get these b/c theres no beating the price.	1
BAD PRODUCT, WRONG WELDED, ITS ONLY WELD INSIDE, BUT NOT OUT SIDE,SO IS NOT RECOMENDED TO USE IT UNDER CAR. PLEASE DONT MAKE MY MISTAKE, IS NOT WELD RIGHT. THIS ITEM HAVE TO BE WELD IN BOTH SIDE, INSIDE AND OUT SITE, NOT ONLY INSIDE. THE PIN OR SECOND SAFETY PIN IS NOT GOOD AT ALL, IT MOVE AND DOES NOT HOLD THE POST RIGHT, ITS LIKE NOTHING, SO DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE IT. --- TORIN WANTS TO SEND IT BACK EVERY YEAR FOR ANNUAL INSPECTION,BUT THEY DONT PAY FOR S/H. THIS SHOUL BE 1 TON, NOT 3 TON WITH THIS WELD FORM.   MY ITEM LOOK USED NOT NEW, LOOK'S LIKE SOME ONE USE IT AND RETURNED AND THEN, THEY SENT THEM TO ME.  THE UPS DROP IT TO THE FLOOR, CAUSE I HAVE A GATE, SO BE AWARE OF UPS, THEY DONT CARE IF THEY BRAKE IT.	-1
These jack stands work great. I have used them over and over without ever having an issue. Due to their simple sturdy construction they should last for years to come.	1
Excellant quality!  The welds are good and the pins slide in and out perfectly!  With free shipping and no sales tax, these are a great bargain.  They are 12.1" high, so make sure you have clearence to put them under your jacked up vehicle.	1
Good product, the safety mechanism is certainly a welcome feature when working under a car.  You the increments are a bit large so you have to get the car up a little farther than you normally would or a bit lower to have it lock into place.	1
I bought these stands after reading here all the feedback about it! I have to say they are good tool for SUV, because they are kind of tall without lifting them not even one pin up.  so if you are looking for a car, they might not be good for you, also make sure you have a jack that can lift it up enough to fit the stands under your SUV  In General, they look very strong and good product and safe to use	1
Having started to do my own car maintenance because I was getting tired of being gouged by dealerships and local shops around the area, I decided to invest in some jack stands.  I decided on Torin before I decided on jack stands. Torin is a good quality name that has a good reputation (at least in my circle of friends), so choosing them was a no brainer. The difficult part was to buy the right ones.  I drive a smaller car, a Nissan 350Z, so I was going to pull the trigger on these 2-ton stands you're reading my review about (&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Torin-T42002A-2-Ton-Double-Locking-Jack-Stands-Sold-in-Pairs/dp/B00026Z3EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Torin T42002A 2 Ton Double Locking Jack Stands (Sold in Pairs)</a>&nbsp;).

The only con is that there is no instruction booklet... but if you're working on your own car (or deciding to), I would assume you were mechanically inclined and therefore would know how to use these stands.

These jack stands are very heavy duty and very tall.  Perfect for Trucks, SUV's, Vans, etc.  The locking pins are directional - meaning that you can only insert them one way, due to their shape.  One of the holes where the pin is inserted is slightly too small.  Could be too much paint was applied, or simply poor machining.  Not worth it for me to return it and wait for another, so I'm just going to take a file or dremel to it.	1
These jack stands are awesome!  I own a Chevrolet Avalanche Z71 and I can fit most standard jack stands underneath the frame without even jacking up the truck, so I needed jack stands that give me the high lift ability while still remaining stable.  The lift range on these jack stands is great, and the build quality is very high.  I have complete confidence in these jack stands while working beneath the truck.  Similar jack stands are well over $75.  The additional safety lock is a great feature, especially if you have to work near the jack stand.  It is a simple metal bar that slides in between the lift teeth, preventing the neck from lowering.	1
I wanted a stand with the double lock and this is it. Have been using it since purchase and have had no issues. Great value.	1
Great looking jack stands, came all black instead of the pictured red. Cast pieces fit a little loose in the frames but with the added locking pins they should work fine.	1
Very bad and incomplete welds.  Some of the welds are blotched. I ordered two sets and had to return them because I did not want to risk the car falling on me.  I also have some pictures attached for you to see.	-1
They are OK jack stands nothing special. The only problems are that the double locking stick thing sometimes is not aligned properly and does not go in correctly. Also the legs are not flat when they wrap which could result in them sinking into your driveway or garage but that is not a problem for me because I primarily use them for a go kart and ATV but I have heard that it is good to get the ones with the flat legs because of those problems.	1
These jack stands are awesome....very tall.  My jeep has 4-5 inch of lift and is sitting on 35s.  These stands have no problems holding it off the ground with lots of room to spare!	1
Maybe the other reviewer had a faulty pair, but upon inspection the welds all seem solid. A few fellow mechanic friends also have Torin stands and they've lasted years. One car is sitting in the garage on four stands, two of which are these Torin 3-ton, and they appear - and feel - very durable. I also like the extra lock...keeps the adjustable part from moving around and making a din during transportation.  At this price point, these are some of the best 3-ton stands. I'm satisfied and will probably get two more sets for the other car.	1

I am very pleased with these jack stands and the price and quality are worth the investment!	1
Very nice set of stands, work great for my truck. double locking and sturdy for a decent price. The welds look good, I trust my life with them while working on my vehicle.	1
I used these two jack stands to hold a Nissan Maxima front end up and they worked without any issues. I will be testing the locking pins to see if they will hold the weight when the latch arm is pulled because I'm curious.	1
After reading about a recent death by a car enthusiast working on his car using non-locking jack stands, I immediately decided to replace my non-locking jackstands with these locking jack stands.  Non-locking jackstands can collapse if the adjustment arm is accidentally bumped and pose a hazard if you're under the vehicle.  These jack stands are high quality and lock so they can't collapse accidentally when you're under the vehicle.  If your jack stands don't lock you really should consider replacing them.	1
The unique locking pin makes these worthwhile. However, when you read the instructions, it's not clear how to bend the "tab" to hold the supports in the frame. Best way is to take a big screwdriver and bend them inward. Can't believe they don't put that on the instructions, since it's not intuitive.	1
Used to keep my RV supported while changing wheels. Seem perfectly adequate and well made Chinese product. Simple to adjust. Price is right for seldom-used (in my case) jack stand.	1
These are great for my Trailblazer, but huge for my daughter's Camaro. So keep in mind, you may want to go with a smaller ton stand if you don't have a truck or SUV	1
Easy on-off filter, I love how much quicker it allows me to change my oil! Arrived quick as well at my FPO address!	1

When I bought my 95 Ford Ranger I found out later that the old wiring connector had been ripped out by a radio thief. I happened to have a spare 2000 Ford Escape radio laying around. After some research on the internet I found out which wires go where and plugged this thing in. Works great!	1

Got the ford radio in my Mazda working	1
Worked perfectly	1
perfect.	1
I've always purchased this filter for my Nissan Altima (122k on the odometer).  Historically, it never went more than 3k before an oil change.  I recently switched to full-synthetic and went 7k before changing the oil.  No telling how the filter held up over the course of 7k miles, but I didn't experience any mechanical issues or notice any changes in performance.	1
Good product and price. Fit properly. Fast shipping	1
This is my second experience with a Fram Ultra Synthetic oil filter.  I ran with Royal Purple 7500 between changes without a bit of mis-fortune. I think im so happy no only because of the incredible quality & to get this for under $10  thats unheard of. Autoparts stores want $16.  5*****  all the way !!	1
good filter, just what i ordered	1
great	1
Good filter, love the rubberized top as it makes it so easy to remove. I replace the filter with every oil change since it is so easy and cheap to do.	1
GOOD	1
Awesome little product! I highly recommend! build quality is great! price is great! Have no regrets buying this, FIVE stars across the board!!! Way cheaper here then anywhere else!	1
Can  beat the $$$$	1
GREAT...	1
better than OEM	1
Works just as well the Mobile 1 filters but for less money. I used it several times and found no issues. It easy to install and remove thanks to the painted grip.	1
fits my requirments.	1
I use this oil filter in our newer Nissan Versa Note. They fit perfectly and are of high quality and durable for long lasting oil filtration. I only use High quality Synthetic oil so this filter is exactly what I need and they have the extra grip material on the end for easier install. Have used these for the last few years and very happy with them as the fit well and are better than OEM.	1
Have been using this this FRAM filter for the last two oil changes on my 2009 Infiniti EX35. Does that job, especially if you change the oil as often as I do. I especially like the extra grip on the filter.	1
Good fit.  Like the grip.	1
The best filter. Lasts a long time. Use when using synthetic oil.	1

I use this filter to replace the OEM engine oil filter for my Kubota ZD-323 diesel zero turn mower.  Have used this filter several times with not issues.  Perfect fit .	1
Does a good job and uninstalling is easier with the extra grip.	1
Very satisfied, I would purchase again.	1
Good deal	1
Fit just like it should, its Fram	1
Quality name brand part at a good price and always in stock.	1
I use syn. oil, good for 10 to 15K mile service intervals.  It is hard to know how well these filters hold up but, I did cut open the same Fram filter I removed for the oil change, which had 10K miles on it.  The filter media was intact with no damage. With my Nissan application (XG6607), it amazes me how little the actual filter is inside the can and makes me wonder how effective it can be over its 15K mile, advertised service life.	1
Now that I have it on subscription, I no longer need to keep track of the oil changes.  When the filter shows up, it has been 6 months.	1
Perfect fit	1
Never buy fram.. Unless you want the cardboard  filter through your motor	-1
Fit perfectly and seems to be working great.	1
Good price perfect fit very Fast ship a must to replace OEM oil filters on a Yamaha R6. The only way they could make this filter better would be to add a wrench off bolt to the top and I'd buy 10 so Id never have to worry about a filter again.	1
Its been said that at least some automobile filters should not be used on motorcycles. I am not in a position to argue that either way, but it did bother me that my dealer charges $12 for a filter that physically appears no different than the ones that cost $5 in any auto parts store.  These Frams seem like a good compromise. They are made in Canada, and appear nicely finished. And they are specifically rated for motorcycle use, so despite having used auto filters in the past, this eliminates one little nagging concern as to whether I was causing long-term problems. And the price was close enough to the auto filters that I didn't feel ripped off.  Delivery was also better than promised.	1
My experience by no means is a proven scientific method of analysis, but the trend I have experienced with Fram filters has been one of reliability. I used Fram on everything from motorcycles, ATVs, cars and my 4x4 trucks. Not one has shown any indication of failure. My truck with over 300K miles is well within its compression window and doesn't blow the least bit of smoke. My motorcycle has over 50K miles and it too doesn't show any appreciable wear.  Does that mean Fram is flawless? Nothing is, but I changed 1000s of engine oil for myself and 100s of friends over 30yrs. I am presently using this 6017A series on a Polaris ATV which is exposed to extreme conditions in the Florida swamps with much success.  Maybe Fram fails easier than others when you push the envelope with going long on an oil change interval. Since I change oil religiously, I may never know what the failure point of a Fram filter is, and I am certainly not interested in finding out the hard way.  I trust Fram as good balance between quality, reliability and cost.	1
Great Oil Filter.  I love the fact that Fram has the stippled tops to their oil filters, making them easy to remove by hand without the use of any tools.  The factory Nissan filters that was originally on the car was smooth and an incredible pain in the butt to get get off.  For that exact reason I always use Fram filters.	1

It fit my vehicle like it aid it would. Aside from that, I don't really know the difference between this oil filter and the next oil filter.	1

BEST OIL FILTER	1
no issues	1
It's an oil filter. It filters oil. Works. Not else much to say.	1
Works great	1
Good quality and fits great in my Nisaan Sentra 2000	1
It fits my 2016 Mazda 3  2.5 Liter engine fine with no leaks.	1
Good	1
Very easy to install.  This is supposed to be one of the highest rated oil filters so helps ease your mind.  The roughed top makes it easy to grip even with oily hands.	1
Excellent product	1
Good product - fast shipping	1

The filter is great as always when dealing with Fram products.  I will be ordering more for future oil changes on my motorcycle.	1
Just what I needed !! The price is right too !!	1
GREAT FILTERS!	1
bien	1
We use this as an option for our 2008 Impreza Outback Sport.  Good filter.	1
It's an oil filter, fit and works.  As far as micron filter capability, I have no way of checking.  I just know its better than a soup can stuffed with rags and glued to the engine	1
Good product	1
motorcycle loves it	1
Good add-on item for the motorcycle. Fit perfectly and seems to work ok. Never had a problem with Fram filters.	1
good filter, fit my bike	1
Been working great for me	1
Fram gets a bad rap. They have actively revamped their quality control and mfg so I have opted to start using their products. In addition I change my oil roughly every 4000 miles anyway and the Extra Guard should be quite capable of handling that.	1
The best oil filter on the market.	1
worked fine	1
Great quality.	1
quality at a good price	1
Great filter	1
perfect	1
WORKED GREAT	1
So hard to rate something like this since I don't have the equipment to analyze my oil. Besides, most of us who take care of our bikes change the filter well before needed. I use this on a 2012 GL1800 and it works well. I'm not concerned about the "basic black" since the belly pan conceals it.	1
it works !!!	1
Works well	1
It fits a Grizzly 660, that's all.  So it works and I'm content.	1
good oil filter	1
Arrived quickly, no problem. Fram quality filter.	1
Fits right. Fram makes solid products	1
Good oil filter	1

Exactly as expected for my Honda PC800.	1

Its a good filter for way less than the other ones. Fine for my 20+ year old bike.	1

Fits my Kawasaki 800A. Always a trusted name. Good filter.	1
Fits my 2013 Triumph Scrambler and works like a Fram filter. Bonus is it's cheaper than other brands.	1
I have never gone wrong with a Fram filter.	1
as expected	1
works as it should and good price	1
good	1
Better price and works better than the factory filter - I use this on my John Deere 4100 Compact tractor	1
Very satisfied.	1
It works.	1
I use Fram filters on everything: car, truck, motorcycle, zero-turn mower, John Deere utility tractor.  Of course the manufacturers want you to use their filters, but I've never had any issues with engine failure due to using a Fram oil filter.	1
If you spend any time on Bob Is The Oil Guy, you'll know how well reviewed these are (they cut them open and post pictures of the internals). Great filter, even better deal when you go the subscription route.	1
I have no current proof that Fram oil filters are still the best, but about 10 years ago, "Consumers Report" tested about 30 different brands of oil filters (Yah, I didn't know there were that many brands of oil filters either." and on a scale of 1 to 10, Fram came in number 10 (The higher the number, the better. 10 being the highest number one could get.) The second place filter was a Toyota oil filter which came in with a number of 5 and every other filter came in below that. Consumers reasoning was, "There are many filters out there that will filter out smaller particle, but they also get plugged up sooner and then the oil is just flowing through the bypass valve, not being filtered at all. The fram filtered out all particle sizes that could do harm to your engine. Once you get below a certain size particle, it won't do any damage to your engine. So that was only one reason that Fram was number one. It also was the best made, according to Consumers Report, which also takes into account the quality of the filter material and the canister, etc.. Of course, Fram is the only filter I know of that has the black no slip surface on it, which mechanics love. Fram really sweats the small stuff. I have been using Fram for many years and I had my own personal reasons, but Consumer's Report just confirmed everything that I thought about Fram. They are, by far, the best (Just my opinion.) Well Consumer Reports opinion also. Granted, there may be a better filter now, but I am sticking with a good thing. Jim A.	1
Bought for our vehicle.	1
Works like it should, no complaints.	1
Great price	1
It's a Fram oil filter. It does what it's expected and doesn't leak	1
Perfect motorcycle oil filter.  I pair with Rotella for a smooth running engine.	1
Fit fine on the 2004 R6	1
Quality weight filter, and being its a Fram, it should be good.	1
filter is 3/4" shorter than Pure One	1
This filters the dirt.	1
good brand good price	1
I have been using these filters for a few years now with no problems. I often use with AMSOIL for extended drain intervals.	1
Fair price if you don't have to pay shipping.	1
Great, love it. Also love the price.	1
Fram makes the best oil filters you can buy. You could buy more expensive filters but they don't work any better.	1
Great price. Even cheaper than walmart	1
Will have to order this again.	1
Performs as desired. Excellent Price!	1
A-1	1
its just an oil filter it works fine	1
These are hard to find in many mass-merchandise outlets plus the price was right and easy, fast delivery.  When you live in the sticks, that combination works great.	1
I use Fram filters all the time. The PH6607 is a perfect replacement for the Honda filter on my zero turn lawn mower.	1
grip coating is helpful. priced right with prime free shipping makes this an awesome deal. I would recommend this item	1
Works as expected. Slightly less costly at Wally's World, but then there's the gas and hassle to get there, get in, get out, and get gone.  Never thought about a subscription for an oil filter.  Probably not.	1
These high quality filters are as expected and the front porch delivery is perfect for me. I will purchase this product again and delivery is a plus.	1
work great just like the were intended to do	1
As advertised.	1
Fit my bikes perfectly	1
Used this on my Triumph Tiger 955.  Fits like the OEM Triumph filter but I had to buy a set of filter caps to get the old filter off/make sure this one was tight due to location--tucked away inside oil pan.	1
Its an oil filter. Doesn't leak so good enough.	1
100 per cent OK!  Meet all expectations. I recommend for all Subaru impreza owners . Direct fit and great value.	1
I have used Fram products for many many years and have never been disappointed. The added grip makes it easy to turn by hand although sometimes I have to use an oil wrench to remove the old filter. With this filter and 4 quarts of oil, I can do the oil change myself for 1/3 the cost of what a dealership charges and probably a better job to boot!	1
Have used without any issues. Does what a filter is supposed to do. Have used and will continue to use Fram filters on our vehicles.	1
The Fram PH6007 Car Filter has always performed as designed without any problems. I have found that it does a good job and has never failed.	1
I have been using FRAM decades.  I have never had problems with this item.  Today there are so many reviews online including negative ones.  I will continue to use FRAM for fuel, oil, air and cabin air filtering.  I am confident to rely on my historical impression of FRAM.  This filter installed correctly onto my vehicle and I note no problems with it even if I wait 5000 miles to remove it at the next oil change.  It lasts, and then some!  Enjoy.	1
it's for Nissan Murano 2007 - it's a fit for it.  Does what it said and well priced after MIR.	1
Excellent filter. I use it on my Polaris A.T.V.'s and my John Deer L130 lawn tractor. They work great.	1
works good	1
Great price and delivered right to the door.	1
What else? It's an oil filter. Do not over tighten or it'll be a pain to get out. As with any other filter.	1
Great direct replacement fit for my 87 Harley FLHS Evolution. Been running this style Fram filter for past 20+ years and 103K miles, works great!	1
Great product, I will definitely be buying this again. I don't know what the hell to look when it comes to finding out the quality but my bikes always ran good and the oil always looks clean when I go to change her.	1
Good deal	1
A reasonably priced alternative to OEM moto and ATV filters. I know Fram attracts a lot of blog criticism, but my own experience has been good, including over 380K on an 18 year old Honda using Fram from the first oil change.	1
It'll do.	1
This fit perfectly on my '92 Nighthawk 750. Fram filters always do great work.	1
Fit perfect on the ST1100. Just not sure about the Fram quality?	1
This Spring '15, I did the annual oil change on my Vulcan 900 and used this filter, replacing the same from last year. I took my bike out for a long ride afterwards; no problem, leaks, whatever. Last season I put 5,000+ miles using this Fram filter. no problems. I had used a K&N filter in the past for more than twice the cost. It was good too. The only advantage of the KN is that it has a knob on top of it  so it can be removed with a simple mechanic's wrench, whereas the Fram doesn't.  But, after you oil the rubber seal on the filter, hand-tight it the filter---no need to use a wrench. I find that it's enough to secure a good seal. This is what I did last year, and as I said after 5K+ and sitting for 5 months in the winter, I was able to remove it by hand. So I'm totally satisfied with Fram.	1
As expected	1
GREAT PRODUCT	1
Fram! It's an oil filter, built well and it's black!	1
Fits a 2010 Polaris Ranger 800XP just fine, much cheaper than the "Polaris" brand filters.	1
The Fram Filter has the same Outside Diameter and is 10mm (?) longer then the Triumph Street Triple OEM filter, but this has know installation issues.  Fit and Function is perfect	1
Don't use them any more	1
Top brand filter for my 2001 Kawasaki Vulcan 1500 Classic FI motorcycle at a decent price.	1
works as described	1
Fit 4 wheeler like factory.  Didnt have to leave home to buy and same price or better than parts store	1
Nice.	1
This fits most motorcycles.  It's a little long, but usually longer is better as long as you have clearance.	1
It fine	1
Great price on a motorcycle oil filter for my Honda VTX1800.  Everywhere else wanted $10 and up for them.  But supposedly, Purolator  PureOne is better.  But I certainly cannot tell.	1
Its good.	1
I hate going to the store as asking the parts guy for specialty parts - all good.  Fram has never let me down.	1
MOTORCYCLE LOVES IT...	1
Fits FZ6 fine	1
As stated	1
always a good filter	1
Good price and I don't have to leave the house to get it!	1
Purchased these for my 2002 honda VTX 1800.	1
Excellent quality and even better price	1
I got tired of paying for the dealer or manufacturer's over pricing on my ATV oil filter so I did some cross referencing and found this one for my Arctic Cat ATV. This Fram doesn't have the capacity (about a third smaller) but it fits perfectly and using Fram so many years, I very much trust the performance I'll get out of it and it's practically half the dealer cost. I'm sure Fram has a bigger capacity that'll fit but I'm not that concerned as I can change these nearly twice for one of the others. But again, I wouldn't say this is a worthy trade-off unless I trusted Fram as I do.	1
Works good. Have been using for long time.  Happy with product	1
Fit as listed, trust it more than any options in the price range. Will use it next time, too.	1
Works great on my Kawasaki Vulcan Nomad.	1
Easy to Install.  Fits well.  Does what its suppose to.	1
Works well	1
Exact part and did the job	1
A+	1
Fram makes great filters. Fit is just right. Not much else to say. Very satisfied and will definitely buy again.	1
Simple to install, just like OEM.  The outside has subtle dimples in it making it easier to grip with a filter or a pipe wrench.	1
Bought this for use as a shot glass. Real men drink out of oil filters. Are you a man? Then get this.  Oh and if you need a oil fllter for your bike? Just go into your cupboard and grab a shot glass. It's a win win.  I have so much chest hair.	1
Oil filter fits '93 Honda NightHawk CB750. What more needs to be written? It is only a disposable oil filter.	1
These are a great high flow filter and the price is good as well. The shipping was a bit slow but these are for my stock.	1
Purchased for a 2005 Grizzly 660. was correct filter and cost 1/2 price Yamaha wants for filter and I'm sure does just the same thing	1
Shoppe around a little for a motorcycle filter for my 2004 Kawasaki Mean Streak. I like Fram and have used their filters on other bikes without any problems. So I bought it. Will buy another when the time comes.	1
great price for the filters and they work perfectly on my '04 Triumph Thruxton...no leaks and great oil filter protection	1
I prefer Wix brand filters but the difference in price was the main reason I purchased this filter for my 2007 Yamaha 350 Grizzly 4X4  Fram has a good history of making OEM quality filters and this filter will not disappoint. Fits and looks great.	1
I like saving a few bucks ordering filters online.  this one was a perfect for for my bike.  I would recommend.	1
worked fine...went on with no problems and I like the price much better than the cycle shop's price...next time for sure	1
I have been using Fram filters for years on all the vehicles I can find them for.  No issues at all with quality and nice to find it for my motorcycle on Amazon.	1
How much can I say about an oil filter. Fits my bike and price was good. No complaints. Would buy again.	1
Great product!!!!  I would recommend to my friends and family.  And what a bargain!  Great purchase!  Fits my bike just as they promised.	1
Fram's a solid name in the motoring industry and at a price that's still reasonable.  Never had a filter fail in a car or bike.  Buying the multi-pack for the bike was a great value since oil is changed more frequently with motorcycles.	1
I've *only* been using the Canadian-manufactured Fram PH6017A oil filters on my 2001 Honda Shadow Sabre 1100cc motorcycle since the day I purchased it new and it now has 85,000 miles and is still ticking just fine.  Course, I did the scheduled oil changes every 3000 miles religiously, have used semi-synthetic oils as well as diesel-rated mineral oils (more zinc).  I don't ride like a maniac so I'm not torturing the engine or anything like that, but I do ride agressively.  Is that proof enough that this filter is one of the best for the application out there or what ???????!!!	1
I have always used Fram . I have been using Fram for 40 years  . Good price thank you  Fram	1
The Fram PH6017A Motorcycle Filter has always performed as designed without any problems. I have found that it does a good job and has never failed.	1
WHO MAKES FILTERS BETTER THEN FRAM? :) EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER BOUGHT ON AMAZON AS FOR THE MOST PART MET MY EXPECTATIONS.	1
Fram has a horrific history of manufacturing oil filters that fail. Their filters leak and do a poor job at filtering impurities. There are websites devoted to discussing oil and oil filters and Fram products are nearly universally criticized and avoided. There are also videos online that investigate Fram oil filters and they are nearly all universally negative.  Purolator, Wix (NAPA), Mann, Mahle, are some quality filters. Fram are the worst filters and you are risking harming your bike.	-1
It's a Fram - a name I've learned to trust over the years. My only gripe is that none of my cap filters fit on the end, even the small ones.	1
It's an oil filter. It has been on for a few weeks now and hasn't come off, so I suppose it's working. It's hard for me to justify giving an oil filter a 5-star rating. What would the filter have to do to earn that? The only thing I noticed is that this one appears to be *SLIGHTLY* shorter, in length, than the one originally on my bike. I ride a 2008 Victory Kingpin and this was about 1/4 inch shorter. Hopefully, that doesn't mean that it isn't able to do the same amount of "work." The rest of the fit was snug and seems to be just fine.	1
Perfect match to fit my V-Star 1100 Classic with the oil conversion kit.  Received very quick and would recommend to anyone as a good replacement filter.....just make sure it's the correct one listed for your motorcycle.	1
It fits my 1999 Kawasaki Vulcan Classic 1500 and Fram is a respected brand. I didn't give it 5 stars because how can you "love" an oil filter.	1
I bought this as a extra , so that when I change the oil I will have a new one.  It look to be of great quality and I am sure it will work just fine.	1
Great filter and the price is right.  I've been using this for years without any problems...over 42K on it now...	1
Exact fit for my Polaris Ranger. A lot cheaper than the Polaris filter it is the equivelant for. Got four so I have filters for several more oil changes.	1
I use these on my Honda Valkyrie and Goldwing.  Don't let the Honda guys tell you that you need to use Honda filters.  These Fram filters have never been an issue on my bikes.	1
This was a filter for my Honda Shadow. Fram filters seem of quality construction And service was amazingly fast. Anazon Prime is the way to go on items like this or things you would have to drive around and search for.	1
Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well, no issues. Would purchase again.	1
While the price might be better at WalMart, NAPA or wherever, this price is good when you consider the gas saved by hopping in the car and driving to a retailer that carries the filter.	1
Used this for an oil change on my 2002 Sportsman 700 twin.  Fits great, no leaks.  Good price too.  I bought an extra one to have on hand for the next oil change	1
Nice jack but mine arrived with slight paint wear/abuse. The box it comes in is weak and the jack pokes through. Not enough for me to return but something to keep in mind if looking to give as a gift. Other wise a nice jack for the money (In the $120 range)	1
This thing is heavy!!! so heavy that when it was shipped to my place, the box that came with it could not hold the floor jack and things were poking out of the box. All the styrofoam inside was squished and torn. I feel sorry for whoever is carrying and shipping this thing. I know I would hate it.  I ended up with some minor scratches when receiving, I didn"t mind. its going to get scratched up anyways in my garage.  Besides, you could repaint it if you really really want it that nice looking.  Used it a few times. works great like its supposed to on my 1998 Toyota Avalon. This seems like it will last me forever.  Great buy if you don"t have one.	1
Easily lifts the entire front or rear end of my Honda Accord.  Very solid construction.  I'm amazed that Amazon was able to ship it to me for free!	1
I bought this when Amazon had it for under $100, what a deal!!  This thing is freaking heavy duty.... weights as much as a small car!!(not really) lifts pretty good, lowers easily too. I have it sitting in my garage,.....makes swapping out the wheels off my 3 vehicles easy...especially with winter coming. The only bad thing...if i had to nit pic was moving the thing around and positioning under the car...it's heft makes it a bit cumbersome. I guess I was used to a nice small aluminum jack I used before purchasing this beast.	1
Awesome jack, never had a single problem with it	1
Awesome jack.  I use this for my pickup, my ATV and my Cub Cadet riding mower.  Don't forget to use jack stands.	1
this jack weighs in at about 79 pounds.. it cost me $79.. free shipping.. thats about A dollar a pound for a big heavy jack..used it once so far and i suspect it will be in my estate.. amazing.. say what you want about the chinese, they can produce a jack of this apparent quality and get it to me for $79 is simply amazing..	1
This 2-3/4 Ton jack worked very well to jack my Civic and Grand Cherokee for oil changes. I had purchased an extra large Universal Slotted Jack Frame Rail Protector, which was great for the jeep, but too tall for my Honda.  The bar has two sections. The additional leverage of the 2nd section made it very easy to pump one handed, whole positioning the jack stand with the other hand.  The box was nearly destroyed from recent freak thunderstorms, but the jack was fine.	1
Purchased this in December of 2014 and it's already not holding the Jeep up. My Jeep weighs in at about 4600 lbs which is about 2.5 tons. This jacks held it up at first, but over time (about a year) it started giving out. Will hold for about 15 minutes then slowly lets the vehicle down slightly. I would not label this Heavy Duty. Since it's been over a year, I can't return it. Plus I don't want to pay to ship it to the company for repairs. Would cost as much as I paid for it the first time. Just get a Harbor Freight slim profile 3 Ton Jack when they're on sale for $80. I've had no problem with it and my local garage uses the exact same model. Torin is probably Chinese junk.	-1
I've owned this jack now for 10 years, using it regularly for maintenance and repair of my own cars/trucks. It gets low enough to slip under every Honda/Nissan/Subaru I've owned, and jacks high enough to suit the majority of needs for a 1/2Ton pickup. This jack has never left me down (pun intended). After ten years though it is starting to show a little age. The jack will (over a period of 15-20minutes) drift down under load, but then again I've never checked the fluid level. The release has become hard to release if you're not careful, but I've learned to not tighten it as much before jacking and it's fine. The wheels are rusted and the paint is flaking, but I've never been overly careful with fluids (especially brake fluid) coming into contact. Very happy overall with this jack.  My only big annoyance comes with the removable handle - when pulling the jack across the garage sometimes the handle becomes disengaged from the valve mechanism at the jack body, requiring some fiddling to get it back in. I've also since added a threaded bolt to keep the two halves of the handle securely together.  To be honest I came to amazon to shop around for a new jack, but after reading reviews here and elsewhere, I decided to just invest a little time and effort and clean mine up. Tightened the casters after adding some fresh grease to bearings, oiled everything up, and it works like new now. Still need to top off the fluid but I suspect this will help with the drifting.	1
fast shipping quality product !	1
A++++ Excellent product and service	1
Works great!	1
Great jack. Works vary well no conpants.	1
Works great. Not overly fond of the handle screw or the sensitivity when lowering it. Crappy packaging.	1
Works great.  I have used it a number of times to rotate tires and it makes the job so much easier.	1
It picks things up like it's supposed to!!!	1
awesome	1
This jack was a bargain.  It shipped for free.  If I was charged shipping I would be paying double.  The jack is heavy and too heavy duty to carry in my truck for flat tires.  I gave it to my nephews for the farm to work on machinery, tractors, trucks and cars.  They like it and have been using it.	1
This is a very heavy duty jack at 80 lbs. It had no trouble lifting my Subaru Impreza 2.0i, but it did have issues with the handle turning the gears to lower the jack. I had to fight with positioning it while my car was in the air. Turning it counter-clockwise wasn't engaging the gears to loosen and drop. Playing with it for 10 minutes I managed to get it to engage then the slightest turn sent the car crashing down uncontrollably. I'm returning this jack for the PowerZone which was out of stock when I was desperately looking for a jack to install my summer wheels. Stay away from this jack!	-1
Don't waste your money on this piece of $$$***, TRIED TO USE IT TO JACK UP MY GARDEN TRACTOR, OK IT JACKED IT UP...TURNED AROUND TO GRAB A WRENCH,AND IT WAS ALMOST TWO INCHES LOWER AND STILL SINKING, CHECKED THE OIL-IT WAS FULL....TIGHTED THE HANDLE VALVE AS TIGHT AS I COULD WITHOUT USING A PIPE WRENCH ON IT...NOPE............JUNK CHINA $$$*** GOT ME AGAIN....GRAB YOUR ANKLES...IF YOU BUY IT....	-1
I purchased this exact model from an auto parts store years ago when my trusty Craftsman 2 ton that I had used for 20 years suddenly quit in the middle of an important job. I never would have gone for one of these cheapie Chinese made ones, but I needed a jack ASAP. I was surprised to find a very sturdy, decently painted jack that has served flawlessly ever since. There is a LOT of metal in this jack. Its very, very heavy. The handle is steel as well. It lifts and stays without fail every time, even through jobs that take days to finish.  Based on that experience, when I needed an additional jack it seemed like a natural thing to order another one of the same, so I did. The jack arrived today in packaging that had burst open. Its not packed well enough, as other commenters have indicated. But what killed the deal for me was the chassis is warped so only three wheels touch the floor. Are they selling factory seconds online? IDK, but I sent for a replacement. If the second one arrives in this state I'll give up on Amazon for this, drive to the store, and buy one I can inspect.  I'll update this when the second one gets here. It's very easy to return, just put it back on the porch and click through a simple thing on Amazon.  If you get one that's not damaged, the quality meets or exceeds what's needed for occasional consumer level use.  EDIT: Replacement jack arrived in two days, via FedEx. This time the box looked relatively intact and the jack was in good shape. So thats three of these jacks I've seen now, two I have and one I rejected; and on each one, the instruction manual appears to have been tossed in on top of the jack before the paint was fully dry... all 3 jacks had the manual stuck to the top of the jack to some degree resulting in blemishes in the black paint. At this price they will get no complaints from me, but at some point you would think they would understand if you cant wait for the paint to dry, don't put the manual on top of wet paint.	1
I have been using this jack for a long time with no problems.  My car, my truck...it'll do everything I need it to.  It is a bulkier jack so plan on asking a friend over if you need to pick it up.  Also it barely fits under my sedan, so if you have a lowered vehicle or a sports car plan on spending the extra money for a low profile aluminum model.	1
After pricing out a multitude of other models and comparing personal comments I purchased this jack from Amazon.com. After the jack arrived I used it to lift the vintage Mustang off the ground where it stayed all night long.   It's only fair to say I have used it just a few times so far but I'm ready to replace my other jack with another one of these.	1
I needed a high capacity floor jack to work on my wife's van. Saw the reviews and decided to give it a shot. Price was very good and with free shipping even better. Arrived in a couple days. The box was beat up but that is to be expected with a heavy item. Everything was there and no damage. This effortlessly lifts the van for easy maintenence. Very sturdy so I feel safe working under, of course jack stands are a must also! The old jack I used was a Sears 2 ton which still works but doesn't feel as durable as this one. I've had this for over a year and it works perfectly. I plan on ordering another one for when I have to rotate the tires.	1
good quality on time	1
Yes, it fits Jeep Cherokee 2001 XJ.  I have been usig the HP1 for a couple of years now.  Allowing for more oil to be pushed up during cold starts	1
I am using these on my motor home's 454 chevy motor.  I think extra filtering capability is much needed with this engine	1
Use this oil filter exclusively in my Malibu Response ski boat with the Malibu Monoson (Chev 350) engine Great performance and I would recommend without hesitation for all automotive uses, where you want to ensure maximum protection for your engine.	1
Exactly What is described. Not many companies make such a large filter for such a reasonable price. Best bang for the buck type of deal!	1
Previous Opinions based on my need for product NOT indicative of Product Quality or SELLER characteristics ... In order to clarify - SELLER PROVIDED EXCELLENT SERVICE  & FLAWLESS TRANSACTION. GREAT SELLER - Revised & Updated FEEDBACK -POSITIVE - HIGHLY RECOMMEND - GREAT SELLER,	1
great	1
I do not have an auto parts store that carries this filter near me so I have to order them online.  This filter gets great reviews and I agree.  I use this on a car that I do not log in many miles and I change the oil VERY often.  The oil comes out clean and this filter withstands being mounted directly behind a rear wheel.  With all of that being said, if my engine blows up due to an oil related failure I will hunt the people from FRAM down and possibly go after their families......	1
What can you say about an oil filter.  I've always used Fram filters this one was for my boat.	1
Filters oil	1
great	1
The filter does look to be a good filter but it does not fit the Volvo Penta or other 4.3l inboards as others have stated. You need the 18-7879 filter.	1
Works well in our Merc 3.0. What more is there to say?	1
Installed thermostat in a 2002 Merc 3.0L as a maintenance replacement and engine overheated within 15 minutes of idling. Put in old Merc OE Stat and engine ran at normal temp. Verified this is the same temp rating 160F as the old Merc one, but it wouldn't open at the correct temp. It's too bad the Stat is junk in this kit because it comes with all the handy gaskets. Will have to return it.	-1
exact replacement	1
fits	1
Good fit.	1
Extremely high quality and easy to install. I recommend this above other filters for many reasons but you really can't beat the price for the quality.	1
Without having even 10 hours of operation on this set of ignition coils (three of them for a 70 hp Johnson) the ignition coil on cylinder number two failed. While I was on the lake. And I had to limp it back to the dock. Fortunately, I had a spare ignition coil on a 30-year-old three cylinder 70 hp Johnson which was on my fishing boat which was on the trailer.  The Sierra coil's have no identification markings or trademark logos on them anywhere. After 40 years as a professional automotive technician, I have found that companies that are so embarrassed of their parts ,  that they won't even put identification on them realize that they are selling junk.  I will return all three of these coils and go with  CDI  or factory original .	-1
worked great , exact replacement , good strong spark	1
Worked perfect, exact match to OEM.	1
Very good.	1
Perfect fit on my 1984 Evinrude 70.  Brought that dead cylinder back to life.  Easy install.	1
Can't beat it! Installed it on my 35hp Johnson.  Gotta build the cables yourself but it was easy.	1
Works great! Put on 1990 350 Mercruiser Bayliner Capri 2050cx gen one outdrive.	1
Does the job	1
Works well.	1
Exact fit for my 2003 mercruiser 5.0 (carb).  Works Great!	1
Working great on my 96 Maxum Mercruiser.	1
Worked, fixed the problem.  Good product.	1
Works and fits great.	1
It works perfectly with my 1988 Mercruiser 4.3L	1
Perfect was part of a tune up on a merc 5.7.	1
Thanks	1
So i know people reported that this indicated 50-60 degrees hotter than it should.  I know my engine is not overheating because i used my laser thermometer and measure the temp at the thermostat and it was at 145 (normal) however the gauge was indicating around 190 or so.  I replaced my temperature sender on my 5.7L Mercruiser and i had the same issue.  However i noticed that i my gauge was a Teleflex (original) so it made sense that the sender and gauge didn't seem to be talking the same language..  My mechanic said that making sure you have the right sender thats matched up to the right gauge is important for temp accuracy.  I purchased the Sierra Water Temp gauge that should go with this sender (from Amazon) and will swap it out this weekend and see if i see it solve the issue.  **Update apparently a resistor can be added to the sender wire to lower the temp indicated if it's wrong**. What a pain!!!  Next time I'm buying original Mercury parts!	-1
Works perfectly	1
good	1
price and product = just right	1
Seems correct for my use	1
Can't have a rack attached to oem gutters on a vehicle with a pop top roof unless add after market gutters that attach to the pop top . Thule is one of the few rack system manufacturers that provides a solution to that problem.	1
Well designed and they work perfectly.  I have a jeep wrangler Rubicon and was anxious to see how secure I'd be able to load my kayaks.  Needless to say, I'm very satisfied.	1
Works great.	1
The only thing I did not like about this product was the price.  However, after searching for all no-drill options for my 2013 Rubicon, this was the most economical given I had an existing cargo carrier.  It is built extremely solid.  After mounting the foot pegs and load bars, I installed my cargo cage.  You can grab the cargo cage and rock the truck.  I wish the foot pack came with the locks included.  Locks are an additional $60 or so.  Great design and would highly recommend.	1
Just as I expected from Thule. Thanks, RJMead.	1
Expensive, but does the job.  Most roof racks do not work on a Jeep because they have a removable hard top roof and there is nothing to anchor the roof rack.  I happened to see this on a jeep just like mine and spoke to the owner.  he had been in contact with Thule and they had shipped him a set of Thule racks with gutter mounts.  He said he had used them for some time and hauls a kayak and a gear holder and had never had a problem, so i ordered a set. They went on quickly and easily and  except for the price, i have been satisfied.	1
Works good on my 2013 JKU Rubicon..	1
These mounts have worked perfectly holding my large Thule rooftop storage box firmly in place.	1
This worked well on my Thule Cargo basket on top of a Land Rover Discovery 2002, just wish it wasn't so expensive for just legs.	1
Well made mounts that are very sturdy and not the least bit flimsy.  They mount up easily and do their job.  They come with bar end caps which is really strange as you would think the caps would be included with the bars (they are not) which I also ordered..  Now I have an extra set of end caps due to the screwy packaging system.  Speaking of packaging, this manufacturer needs to learn how to put pieces in a box to limit damage.  3 of the 4 towers had large paint chips down to bare metal due to the metal pieces being thrown around in their box.  How about wrapping each piece so they don't do that? Terrible packaging.  If I want something scratched up, at least let me do it instead of them arriving that way straight out of the box.	1
These are the same exact coils as the ones I had on my sportjet 90, great quality and made in Germany. There are probably cheaper ones you can get online, but I would highly recommend you spend a little extra money and go with teleflex. The money you're saving by getting cheaper ones will cost you your time and more money when you have to replace them	1
Working perfect!	1
Does not work with a original 1957 Chevy truck gauge	-1
Leads are too long. Resistance from ground to secondary and primary to secondary is more than twice that of OEM coil. Would not mount properly without extensive modification. I Have had these same problems with Sierra Johnson/ Evinrude coils before. Will not buy any more Sierra coils. Substandard in my opinion.	-1
Does not fit F series Super Duty no matter how much they try to claim it does. Terrible instructions. Embarrassment to American manufacturing.	-1
When I assembled this, two of the four `fingers' that secure the faceplate onto the pocket broke.  Also, both of the side clips are identical, and therefore one side will not mount properly - my guess is that I received two `Left' pieces instead of one `Left' and one `Right'.  Also, the 6 flathead screws included in the kit were too short to actually bite into the plastic and secure the clips onto the frame.  I used the round-head screws, but they only included 4.  And I agree; they should remove the brackets for the CD jewel cases - who needs them anymore?!  Several misnomers in the product description: o- "Installs an aftermarket stereo with the factory radio brackets" - It does not.  This is a single-DIN pocket, nothing more. o- "Designed and manufactured with precision tolerances, resulting in a gapless fit between the dash and the kit" - it might be gapless for some, but not a Volvo 850 GLT. o- "Painted to match factory dash color" - as long as your dash is black!  This is made with black plastic, it's not painted.  Since it is broken, I will attempt to return it.  I will also spend some time looking for another pocket from another manufacturer in hopes of a better product.	-1
Cheaply made and did not fit my pioneer radio well enough to keep it in place.	-1
All the teeth broke on the faceplate adapter, and the instructions had me remove bracket wings which were absolutely necessary to retain for fitment in my Volvo.	-1
The side hooks  broke  on I nstall	-1
Had to return--missing parts	-1
Attempted to use this kit with an aftermarket radio kit installation. The exterior mounting holes were so shallow they broke right off. Don't waste your money on this item.	-1
It arrived with scratch and scuff marks all over it.  Unfortunately I couldn't leave my dash dismantled so I was forced to use it anyway and it's surprisingly flimsy, does nothing to secure the radio in the Kit, it's just for looks and it fails there as well.	-1
didn't fit my 03 dodge ram 2500 as advertised	-1
Did not fit my 2000 Caravan. Order the 99-6700 instead.	-1
I originally purchased a different Metra kit, 99-6504, to install a Clarion NZ503 stereo into my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but because of the tight fit between that Metra and the Clarion, the Clarion's pop-out screen kept getting jammed when trying to slide out, but the the that kit's fit with the Jeep console was great.  Nevertheless, I purchased this kit to solve the jammed pop-out screen, and while resolve that issue, the fit between this Metra kit and the Jeep console is quite poor. There are uneven gaps between the Jeep's foam opening the the rounded rectangular perimeter of this Metra faceplate.  How they could do it correctly with one kit and botch it on another kit is baffling.	-1
Worked great for about two tubes of grease.  I tried to load and the other plunger would not stay retracted to load and kept making a huge mess.  Wasted about 2 tubes of grease just trying to load the gun.  Never had this issue before with any of my grease guns.	-1
The tool itself does not function as it should. After receiving the tool, I attempted to load the tube with a grease cartridge. The tool down not cone with instructions so if your not great at feeling your way through things then this isn't the tool for you. After fiddling with the tool for almost an hour (assembly and cartridge loading), the plunger didn't function as it should. It went straight through the product and didn't remain in position. There was grease everywhere! I had to manually refill the cartridge with the contents of the two exploded cartridges and then it functioned at about 73%. I'm not happy at all.	-1
I still can't figure out how to load this thing. no instructions.	-1
Complete JUNK! The end has a grip to tight, it won't let go of the fitting when done. This isn't my first grease gun, so I know how to operate one. When the tube is in, the piston/plunger is so tight in the tube, it almost takes two people to pull the tube out to replace. Pumps very little grease and when it does, it takes forever to get anything to come out of the nozzle. I would NOT recommend.	-1
doesn't make a tight seal with the grease nipple. There was more grease oozing out of the nipple fitting than there was going into the joint. Ended up picking one up at a local auto parts store. Gave this one to my obnoxious neighbor. He no longer asks to borrow my tools, Maybe I should give this thing a higher rating...	-1
Will not pump grease. Returning it.	-1
Cheap can't assemble due to poor engineering.	-1
Works well but some assembly required. The unit is incorrectly assembled and must be reassembled. Otherwise it seems ok. Stopped working 1/2 way through second tube	-1
The hose does not release from the grease fittings very easy, it actually pulled my grease fitting out of my lawnmower.	-1
The flexible hose was plugged on one end.  Never seen this on a grease gun??? Had to buy another hose to be able to use this item. Would have dealt with seller/manufacturer, but that would take too long.  Update: I did pick up another hose for ~$9 and the grease gun worked OK. Would have been better off buying a grease gun at my local auto parts store which had them for the same proce.	-1
If your idea of a good product is one that has you throwing tools and cussing, than this is for you. This is total junk...first of all the fitting is so tight on and off that its useless. Then, when it finally came off the metal broke at the hose thread.	-1
Worked well for a while but after a little use the plunger failed and now grease leaks behind it and goes to waste in a matter of 10 minutes or so. Look elsewhere for a mini grease gun.	-1
50 years on a farm, I have never had trouble with a grease gun. Bought 2 of these. One with a tube the other with a flexible line. Neither work. Thirty miles back to town. When you buy from China, this is what happens.	-1
[EDIT] After using this for several months I'm lowering my rating considerably. If you only have to use it once, it's a good tool for a good price. But as others have said, the plunger does not seal. All the grease slips past the plunger (inside the gun). When this happens, the gun stops working entirely. Cleaning it out is a nightmare. It's a messy, messy nightmare.  If it broke today, I would NOT buy another one of the same. All the cons I listed below are still there, but the added problem of the leaky plunger makes me lower my rating to one star. [/EDIT]  It's inexpensive and it works good enough. With every pull of the trigger some grease comes out, but then it keeps coming out until pressure equalizes. It's an air pressure thing - if you have any air in the system (and I don't know how to get all the air out), it'll keep leaking grease until the pressure equalizes.  It's inexpensive and works ok. If it broke today, I'd buy another one of the same.	-1
The barrel of the gun is to small to accept the cartridge. I spilled and ruined one grease cartridge. you have to be King Kong to push the cartridge in. The handle and hose are okay, I bought a lubrimatic grease gun and have no problem. The cartridge, the same one that won't go in the Legacy gun, slid right in. Don't buy this product!	-1

These gloves feel extremely cheap. The stitching looks like a rushed job and the sizing is off. I wouldn't wear these unless I had to.	-1
Cheaply made	-1
Poor stitching on thumb of right glove, causing a split in the seam.	-1
The parts list in the operation manual and the actual jack you receive do not match. This is a cheaper version with the same model numbers. 1. angle brackets,no holes 2. No Hook Guides 3.1 chain not two 4.oil leak at cylinder pump on first use. I will call manufacturer for parts. If I do not get them, then jack goes back. UPDATE BEWARE OF PARTS AVAILABILITY, LEAKS UPON LEAKS DRIFTING AND CONSTANT SERVICE. BEWARE I'VE HAD MANY JACKS AND I PROMISE THIS WAS MY WORST BY FAR	-1
Update:  Toxic Mold / Fungus growth underneath the mats!  See attached photos.  I purchased 2 of this from Walmart including a matching $58 center seam strip which I later found out wasn't really  necessary as the mats were heavy enough to stay in place w/o the center joining strip.  Upon unboxing  this mat, it was REALLY heavy.  Not only that it was rolled-up in such a way that it was a PITA to roll out facing up.  The first box, I just unrolled it flat with the ribbed side facing down since it came rollup up the wrong way.  I then had to flip the entire mat right side up and it was a PITA.  The 2nd mat, I just tried to roll it with the ribbed side facing up, it took a lot of back and forth slowly rolling it a few inches out since the way it came rolled up, you could just roll it out.  Not sure why it came rolled up that way.  After it was all said it done, it did look amazing when it was clean.  However, when it gets dirty or wet, there is not way to easily sweep it due to the ridges.  You either had to just sweep it all the way to the front of the garage or grab a vacuum.  When it gets wet, same thing, you can try to use a rag but it's hard to get in between the ribs.  Today, I decided to grab a hose and hose out the entire mat and drying it up took forever due to water getting trapped in between the ribs.  I first grabbed a broom to swept as much water out as I could out the garage. I then grabbed my microfiber mop to get the rest of the water.  This thing is hard to clean.  Especially sweeping up a few dirt and sand.  Easier to just vacuum it up.  Also, there are a few areas where the cover has been gouged.  Not sure how that happened.	-1
An accident waiting to happen, and it did!!!!  The product is durable as advertised but poorly designed. the ribs that allow the water to run off and out of the garage are so slippery when wet, you cant walk on it with slipping and falling. I did several times, I ended up putting and old carpet over it, but still have to be careful around the edges.  Im talking like leather shoes and ice slippery.  looks and works great when dry, just donr get it wet !!!	-1
This thing is worthless for ice and snow which melts and runs off the sides of the mat onto the floor. Would probably work if it had raised edges to contain the water. If you are planning to buy one of these to keep your floors dry save your money and buy a squeegee, much cheaper and works better.	-1
The directions for this product say that you should "shake it".  The product could not be mixed.  Clear liquid and a lump of white goo.  I even tried to mix it with the mixer part for my electric drill.  No luck.  Very disappointed in this product.  I don't know if it was old stock, had been frozen or what.  Didn't work for me.	-1
Does not preform like other Meguiars products I have used in the past. My travel trailer is a 2015 and just the front end cap was oxidizing.  Tried a small area to test before taking it to the detail shop to have buffed. Looked good. Then it rained and it re oxided and you couldn't see where I had polished at all. The detail shop used their own products and it looks brand new.	-1
I'm sure the product is just fine. However, one-step to me includes wax. Meguiar's make a one-step with wax for RV, so the error is on my part, but I feel it is slightly mislabeled. Meguiar's used to have Step/Stage One for cleaner/polisher and Step/Stage Two for the wax. So one step is not one step for the full job, rather it is one-step to clean/polish.	-1
Disappointed from meguiars on this. It's very finicky for a one stepp compound & believe the whole purpose of a one step product is to lower the performance but make it more idiot proof.... Dumb it down. So I don't have to think, just wax on; wax off. Well, if you're not careful you'll make it worse & have to buy a competitive product to fix it. Oh well, lesson learned.	-1
Better than nothing but still takes a lot of elbow grease to remove heavy oxidation from RV.	-1
Well made but it will NOT fit a 365/75R16 which is listed as 31X10	-1
this cover fills with water every time it rains so it sags. Will have to take it to an upholstery shop to have grommet installed at bottom so it will drain.	-1
Not real denim, this is more of a plastic type material. I have a Smittybuilt denim cover that I'm comparing this to. This cover did fit a 35 baja claw with some finagling	-1
I had a 12 year old boat that I never washed or waxed the entire time I owned it. I didn't know I needed to. I kept the boat in Ontario, and I live in Pennsylvania. The boat was either in the water or in winter storage in the marina. So I had a very dull gel-coat issue. I bought this thinking that this would do the job, because it had an aggressive and polishing characteristics. I should have bought perhaps 3 buffing compounds: course, medium, and fine.	-1
No adjustments can be made (no shims included) 2 1/2 both ends.	-1
Had to send it back.  Fitting from a chart didn't go so well.  Didn't want to have to repeat this several times till I found one to fit.  Return was processed quickly.  Went for the hard cover one which fit great the first try.	-1
get the DENIM version instead. this vinyl version looks very cheap. i have the denim version, same bestop brand, for my other rig in a 33" and it looks waaay better.  fit was okay, on a 35x12.5 BFG Mud Terrain T/A KM.	-1
It arrived with a split seam.  I decided to try it anyway just to confirm it would fit and it did not fit a 35x13.50, so I did not order a replacement.  It does not look like it would be easy to install or remove, so just be aware of this if you use your spare regularly (for example, off-roading or construction).	-1
In replacing my stock exhaust for my 2005 Jeep Rubicon LJ softtop, I did my research and many reviews said that this muffler's sound was like stock at idle and neutral at 3000 rpm. That is all correct. But when I installed it, found that the (fewer) reviews elsewhere that had pointed out it created massive drone at road speeds were also correct. Its not noise that will irritate you in your driveway, it's noise that will irritate you when you are on the road or trying to listen to the radio. It's the very definition of drone. Swapped this out after one week (approx 130 miles of trying to like it) with a Walker Quiet Flow (actually made by same company as Dynomax) which took just one pipe reducer from the 2.5" to the 2.25" to make it work. Happy to hear the radio and enjoy my jeep again.	-1
Listed in the Amazon "Fits Your Car", or whatever that section is called, for a B6 Passat with the 2.0T engine. Not even close to fitting the factory exhaust pipes. Well made and packaged impressively though.	-1
I don't like it. Seems pretty cheap. Spend a few more bucks.	-1
This is beyond loud, I have a 94 Montero with a 3.0 v6. It sounds like I have a open exhaust. A mellow tone with true performance sound? not even close its as bad as those loud stupid Hondas with the fart mufflers on them.	-1
This resonator did not make much of a significant difference in the sound of my exhaust. I have a Turbo Honda civic d15b.	-1
Says 4-1/2 to 9 psi, but Hooked it up and it is a 1 to 4 psi regulator.	-1
Im not an expert, I can only give a review based on the experience I had. It was disappointing that the fittings did not come with the part. I can understand that different application require different fittings, and that the price point is possibly low enough to but fittings separately, however, I still fault the product for not having generic fittings that work in most cases. Sourcing fittings was more difficult than buying the regulator. Furthermore, the regulator didn't change my pressure based on the meter I was using. Maybe it was broken, maybe it was user error. Either way I purchased another product to solve my problem.	-1
The holes for the mounting bracket holes in the body of the regulator were not tapped to accept the screws. Go Chinese quality control!	-1
The store said these were much better than the others that they sold.  The other must have been horrible.  Mine could not regulate pressure at low flow reates because of an internal leakage around its check ball.  It is a regulator appropriate for large engines like we used to use. For use on a smaller 4 cylinder  engine, you  need to add a circuit to bleed pressure back to the low pressure side of the fuel pump.	-1
Honestly! What can you say other than I'm pretty sure I could have made this in the hardware dept. at Lowe's for cheaper. you do get the cool looking MSD sticker though.	-1
I'm furious that I had to return. Product not supported! Should have told me that in description!	-1

Great cable, cheap plastic connector.	-1
Beautiful hitch cover, but does NOT fit 1 1/4 " hitch, as advertised.  I searched all over for 1 1/4" and thought I had found one.  Received it early, just in time to travel to two consecutive away games, but can't use.  Waiting to see what happens with the $13.99 shipping I paid!	-1
This product didn't meet the description shown in the ad.  The ad stated that it would fit both size receivers and it does not.  I returned it.	-1
The hitch cover came, and looks great.  It is as it looks in the picture, and is not a helmet as in title.  BUT it doesn NOT fit 1.25" hitch.  It says it does, but it only fits 2" hitches.  Annoying, since this is the second hitch I've bought from Amazon that was mislabled in the description.	-1
Removing the inner bracket, it will fit over the tailpipe, very loosely. I bent the lower half of the bracket to fit around the pipe, using longer screws, I could tighten the bracket. Then the tip will not fit over the bracket. So I forced the tip on the pipe, with the lower half of the bracket, with a lot of effort. Running the longer screws through the tip, thru the bracket to contact the pipe to hold it in place. Hopefully it will stay since the bracket is beyond the turn down, helping hold it in place.  I had attempted to fasten the lower half with a hose clamp, but again the tip would not go over the screw in the clamp. For a 2 inch pipe, the bracket needs to be re-designed. I guess the folks that used these with no problem had either 1 1/2 inch straight pipes, or smaller. I don't see how it would work on even 1 3/4. Not worth returning, with postage ....	-1
Returned the first one thinking it was a fluke. Second one came the same way, just the red N and no "Huskers". Kept it and gave as a gift but not pleased.	-1
Warning:  Not as shown in photo.  Does not say Huskers only the red N.  Received as birthday gift but was past the 30 day return deadline so now I can't return.  Very disappointed.	-1
Too small for 2 inch receiver. I gave it away.	-1
This item is shown and described incorrectly.  What shows up at your door is NOT an offset/offset muffler.  It's offset/center.  Amazon is courteous, polite, and great at exchanging things, but you'll keep getting the wrong item, again and again.  Don't buy this item unless you want offset/center - or unless you want to waste your time and make UPS rich.	-1
I ordered these to use on the rear coil springs on my Ford Taurus. When they arrived the package indicated they are for front coil springs. No where in the Amazon add did it mention they are for front springs. Not worth paying the shipping to return.	-1
It is not entirely metal! The description says it is constructed of "die cast" metal. But only one of the three parts is metal the others are plastic.	-1
Amazon said that it fits on my car, however it does not fit it needs special fitting	-1

Tried to use this on my Envoy (with coil springs, not air-ride) and they were too small to fit in the gap.  I guess your springs have to be really sagging to use these.  They're not really made for SUVs.	-1
A waste of money, unless they fit tightly between the coils with the spring expanded. I tried to use them to add a little lift to the rear of a 2010 Altima. They were not tall enough.	-1

Looks great but the first time anything bangs into something it I'm sure it will break.  It's all plastic.  Looks good but not worth what I paid.  Very bummed out.	-1
be warned, you may need to remove springs or use a springer compressor. they did not fit a raised ford ranger/mazda B2300.	-1

Less than worthless Fell off car leaving clamp attached YES I KNOW HOW TO INSTALL THEM  The design is absurd and cannot work, even if they did not fall off	-1
It's about 1/4 inch too large. Even though it was suppose to fit my 1986 Subaru XT GL. There are no hooks to attach under the car. Once I adapted it to fit it works fine. I still need to get a tailpipe for mine.	-1
Product ripped while trying to put on a car wheel very flimsy	-1
I bought this muffler thinking that it would be very good quality b/c of some of the other reviews I read about it.  I'm pretty disappointed in the quality but as the title of the review says.....  Anyway, I took it to a muffler shop and the guy told me that trying to weld hangers onto this muffler there is a very good possibility that he'd burn through the material b/c it's so thin.  I really can't say much else about it.  Unfortunately, this will probably be something that sits in the garage until one day I can mount it to a lawn mower....LOL!	-1
Not put together well, plastic panels don't fit well on the back and would not be weather proof. I don't know if the MSD Street stuff is made in USA. I would guess not. A stock e-core coil will perform as well or better.	-1
Very poor material. Torn when putting on steering wheel to lace. Would not buy again. Going in garbage. Would give no stars if I could.	-1
Temperature sending "wire" is, at best, fragile. Would feel better if it had a more durable protective coating and more detailed instructions as to uncoiling, placement and exposure. Supplied connections are cheap crimp connectors.  Non-colored supplied wiring is an inexpensive method with all of the wire colored black. Disappointed with a product sold by the fan manufacturer that doesn't exhibit a "quality" piece matched to the fan.	-1
Crappy quality. Made in China. Not real leather. Ripped while installing.	-1
Doesn't fit in the steering wheel you can't cover it the material get scratched easily if you stretch it very hard to tie one side to the other as the instructions said so don't waste money here	-1
Bought to control an electric pusher fan on my CJ7.  First time it got wet it was done.	-1
FAIL!! Inspected right out of the box, and that doesn't look like a good seat to me!! What happened to Quality control on this one. That little spider retainer ring is not straight in which is side loading the pressure spring to one side. Make sure you check equipment and use common sense people before you put parts on your rig.	-1
I had to get the seller to replace it twice because it didn't have threads on the bottom to mount it to the plate. I eventually just asked for my money back but they didn't ask for the regulator back so I brought it to work and tapped the holes myself to make it functional. The regulation function works perfect but I can't give it more than a single star if the average person probably doesn't have a good set of drills and taps to make it usable.	-1
Didnt work. Wish i would have kept all the packaging for a return.	-1
Yes this insulated 'blanket' keeps heat from soaking in quite as fast.  But what nobody talks about is it still lets heat soak in and, once it soaks in it stays soaked in for much, MUCH longer than if you were to have a bare starter that was cooling in open air.  I went from a 15-minute cool-down until start was possible to over two hours.  Now it did keep the starter from overheating in in-town short jaunts, but once the hot weather arrived and I drove on a cross-town freeway well bam.  I was dead in the water.  I pulled this off and replaced with a proper factory heat shield.	-1
This is simply a remnant sheet of pipe insulation. So given what it is, this is EXTREMELY overpriced. I know it will work as it is the same stuff they wrap industrial steam pipes with. This is probably $2-3 in material. I waited weeks to install it due to my schedule so by the time I opened it and inspected it, I was past the return window otherwise I would have. Does it work, yes, is it worth what you pay for it -NO.	-1
This item is not 4" wide.  It is hardly 2.5" it won't fit a normal steering which is about 3 7/8"  The description on Amazon is incorrect.  So save yourself some time and stay away.	-1
Temperature gauge is very inaccurate. I did a test before installing it in my vehicle.  I tested it using a Fluke 80T-150U digital probe and Fluke 8024B digital meter as a comparison standard.  The Sunpro was over 10 degrees off at lower temperatures and then stopped movement at about 190 degrees.  I would understand a few degrees of inaccuracy but this was unacceptable. This would indicate a good temperature of 190, even when your engine is overheating.  Needless to say, I didn't install it.  Waste of money and time.  Made in China....  Spend a few dollars more and get something that works.  They do look good, however.	-1
Looks good at first. Emblem poorly adhered to plate. Fell off within the first few month	-1
Bought one. It ripped putting it one. Thought we were to rough. Ordered a second one, size B. Also ripped. You should have heard the words said when that happened! It says it will fit a 15" steering wheel. Don't believe it. Not very happy after buying two and we still have no steering wheel cover.	-1
Very cheap, you get what you pay for,  Don't try to remove the bulbs once they are installed, the will break at the slightest touch.  Not even installed yet and the wires ripped out of the bulbs, very bad product!	-1
Actually I can't really say that because I had this installed alongside a MSD ignition box ..... my truck went nuts and eventually wouldn't even start. My Nissan 1991 hardbody truck just doesn't savvy up to MSD components.	-1
Leather on one side will bunch up, until you realize the number of lacing holes is not the same on each side.  I spent hours trying to get this to install without the leather bunching up on the front.  All was in vain until I counted the stitching holes and found about 10 extra holes on one side.  This made a big difference between the stiches length, which led to the excess material.	-1
Couldn't even get it installed.  Warmed it up to room temperature (as directed), and tried to get it over the steering wheel.  I went slowly, inching my way around the steering wheel until about 2/3 of the way around, when it had enough and split all the way across.  I double-checked my steering wheel measurements and they fall within the size I got according to the chart (15.25" diameter wheel).  Maybe I just got a bad one?  Who knows.	-1
the product was excellent, but the cover is too large for my steering wheel - it site said it would fit my car.  (It took me hours to install this cover, double check this size before your purchase)	-1
easy to put on but already starting to tear after a few months	-1
Had to re-thread the mounting screw holes in order for them to screw in. Having to keep re-tighten the unit because vibration causes it to come apart. Very disappointed. Expected more from Holley but it looks like their manufacturing is now getting done by cheap labor like everyone else.	-1
I believe this is the first time this happened to me on Amazon....  I purchased a NEW Holley 12-804 Fuel Pressure Regulator and when I received it inside smelled the regulator had a strong fuel smell. I would complain to Amazon but don't know how to do so. If anyone knows how to stress this concern please post a comment. Thanks. (No I have not installed yet, as I just got it today)  Update: I've returned the fpr to amazon. They said I will get a full refund. Just waiting for it. :)	-1
Definitely will NOT fit on most modern vehicle steering wheels.. Maybe older vehicles because they used to have much skinnier steering wheels.  In the era of air bags and steering wheel controls for cruise and radios etc no bueno.. It went about halfway around my steering wheel in a newer Honda civic which looks really cheesy.. I ended up taking it off and ordering the larger supposed thicker version. That covered 60% of the wheel lol.. Still looked terrible looks OK from looking straight on to it but if u look from passengers side or looking down on it the steering wheel looks ridiculous.. Half covered and just not nice looking at all. They have another one here in amazon I ordered after these two that covers it much better and it a FAR superior material.. It's like a smooth matte leather looks very high quality.. Only thing is that one comes with needle and a line with which to sew the seam into the wheel so it takes some time. With no sewing experience it took a good hour and a half to sew it together... But it looks amazing perfect coverage..expensive high end look and no plastic line wrapping around it over and over to keep it on.. You literally stretch the leather over and sew it together around the wheel.. It looks like a custom leather wrapped expensive steering wheel that belongs in a Cadillac or Mercedes.. Really high end compared to this cheesy product.. If u search around I'm sure u can find it..roughly same price as this just look for the one that comes with sewing needles	-1
returned it, did not fit my car, spent about 2 hours lacing it up and was left with about an inch of material too much, photos show problem, this item was suppose to fit my make, year and model car.....it DID NOT	-1
With 84 negative reviews why am I bothering?  Because this has gone from being a superior product to a very not superior product.  I did a Superskin wheel long ago & was happy with the results.  It had three sections of thin leather w/circumferences reinforced by folding over; now it is one piece of thick leather, no folding, & different numbers of holes on the two sides, & naturally they are not aligned.  I couldn't believe how poorly the new one turned out, so I talked my sister into buying me another.  I checked it carefully before starting with it & one side had more holes than the other & naturally they were not aligned.  The results were even worse.  When I got the first one off, it also had more holes on one side than the other & naturally they were not aligned.  Superior has lost this satisfied customer.  Why was I installing this wheel cover?  I just bought my younger son a 2002 Avalon, the leather wheel had not passed the test of time & my sister decided to gift this to her nephew.	-1
impossible to install neatly	-1
Did not fit. I measured everything from the chart and still got the wrong stuff	-1
I bought it july 2014 and august 2015 it quit. Still looks new if that means anything. Guess we buy something cheap we just take our chances. Its a 50 year old car and it sits more than goes but speedometer was broke and was using tack to gage speed. Not the end of the world....Robert	-1
Real leather but as people have said in other reviews, the needle is very weak and flimsy. I could literally bend the needle in half with my fingers BE CAREFUL when threading the thread through the leather and beside the steering will, sometime the  needle would bend going over steering wheel. Could potentially break and stab you in the fingers. This seller needs better quality needles and this item will be great.  This Is my second purchased wheel cover for 2016 Versa. The cover takes about 2 hours to install and I did it twice with two different sizes, I pulled the leather tight to my steering wheel but towards the end the leather stretched so bad I had about 4 inches of overhang leather and it wrinkled up very badly and I had to remove. Be aware people purchasing this for a small vehicle. It may not fit and you will waste time and energy trying to make it work. Horrible product and I am past my refund period so I cant even get a refund.	-1
Don't buy these. I put on a set last year and was taking the plate off this year to put on a new annual tag and the screw just crumbled at the head. The threaded part stayed in place.  Now I get to try the dig out the part that is in the hole.  What fun.  Don't use ANYTHING but stainless for this.	-1
Cheap plastic junk, tried to install it and it tore. I am surprised Amazon would carry this	-1
My steering wheel is the perfect dimension for the size C cover, according to the guide. But, when i put it on there is a gap where the edges didn't meet up at the stitching because it wasn't wide enough. On top of that, the overall diameter was too big for my wheel so it gathers up in a few spots. My original steering wheel has spots where the finish is peeling off. I thought if nothing else, this can't look any worse. I think I might have been wrong. I wouldn't recommend this. It took quite a bit of effort to put it on and frankly wasn't worth the time.	-1
It came with a "ding" in it.	-1
It doesn't work......... The funny thing is I removed a working mr gasket Electric pump for a Holley... And the pump will not turn on.... What more can u say.... Keep up the good work Holley !	-1
Must be hard headed. I tried similar helper springs years ago and they did not do the job then and these did not either. Perhaps I was expecting too much from too little but ... gave them to a neighbor and installed Air Lift air springs instead. Lesson learned - for the second time.	-1
Holes were poorly punched, requires quite an effort to thread unlike my Wheelskins product. Looks fine when done but will need A LOT of patience and time to install	-1
Sorry Sunpro, I just left an awesome review for you mechanical gauge, but I have a mechanical gauge because I tried this one first.  It bounced all over the place.  I don't know if it was the sender or the gauge.  I tried several different manifolds (to add or substract fluid damping)  which didn't work. I thought maybe it was some king of electrical disturbance so I used different wires and used a shielding sleeve to shield it from electromagnetic disturbances.  Nothing worked and the readings kept bouncing.  I made sure the manifold was clear and the sender opening was clean...  Needless to say I went mechanical, I do use your electrical oil temp gauge which works perfect.	-1
Junk	-1
My steering wheel was too fat for size "C".  I ended up ripping the stupid thing in half trying to stretch it on my steering wheel.  This thing is absolute crap, and I'm ticked off that I threw away 12 bucks on this piece of junk.  DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Sucks.  leather felt like crap.	-1
Check and double check your carb numbers. This kit looked like it would work. However it was not the right one for the Holley 4 barrel on my Indmar 5.7L marine engine. I ended up only finding this out after I opened the package to start installing it. The blue gaskets would not line up with the bowls. No way to return it after opening.	-1
The "size" A, B,C were not on some of the description and the color description was off  showed tan and got almost gray!  Finally decided to dye the. Cover myself to the color that I wanted since after a return received same color and the right size.  Amazon's return is easy and simple and prompt.  I have used these S.W. Covers many times before and The product is good.	-1
The stairwell covers a cheap junk. They say they will set a steering wheel 4 inches in diameter. My steering wheel my Toyota tundra is 3.3 quarter inch and they do not fit well in their leaves a quarter inch gap. After using the steering wheel cover for about three months it starts to deteriorate. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.	-1
Returned this product.  It didn't fit my car's wheel, even though it was advertised to (it was far too big).  I like the idea, but it doesn't fit. I drive a 2012 Mini.	-1
Product description says 'chrome' which implies metal.  It is plastic.  They should change their description; it is misleading.  I had this for a couple of months before it broke.	-1
The product has very strong odor, you can't wash it off from your hands with soap and water just doing it once.  The whole car is full of the smell of vinil or whatever it made of.  Make my wife and kids throw up.  Walking into Wal-mart, you will find product with thicker padded soft material and odorless, no need to drive with all windows down.	-1
Bought this for my truck to give it a little more carrying capacity. This was suppose to fit exactly. I checked and rechecked to make sure this would fit. Got it and followed the directions to a T and it would not fit no matter how much I tried. Also recieved the item in damaged condition, but this did not in any way cause it not to fit. They need to let people know whether something will or will not fit, not say it will fit, get it and it doesn't. I would go with a name brand like Helwig and not this off brand made in china.	-1
I had a really nice metal one for the longest until I lost it in a move, This one looks great and dose everything its suppose to, how ever being made of plastic , a week later I went through a car wash and the thing broke. I 'm just going to have to look for another metal one.	-1
Poor quality. Small tears started to appear within the first few weeks. It's not the worst steering wheel cover I've seen, but it's not good. We had one before that was ribbed like this that we really liked. It lasted several years. This one hasn't lasted several weeks. I don't know what brand the other one was, but I've been trying to find it again. This is not it.	-1
This Superior Contour Sport Grip Slip on Wheel Cover has a foul odor but is surprisinly comfortable, when the weather is hot the wheel cover is not as hot as the outside temperature but I think it could be cooler to the touch if they added some foam to this product something to at least absorb the heat a little more it is awesome for gripping though, it seems well made with stitching that seems tough, also the instructions make it sound like it is easy to install, but this is not entirely true, I had to get my husband to muscle it on near the end as I simply could not stretch it on that last part of the wheel, plus it was too hot to handle after being in the heat to allow it to warm up before installing, and he was having a little trouble stretching it on  and he's a big guy who use to lift weights, I would of loved it even more had it been much more easy to install than it was. New Review of this product proved this product is poor quality, after less than a year this item has started to fall apart on edging, not worth price and sorry I purchased, usually this brand is exceptional quality but this particular item makes this brand look bad, but would recommend other products of this brand, just not this particular model and style, very bad and you can feel the heat through the wheel cover.	-1
After a month, this is already falling apart.  It also smells really bad...like strong rubber and chemicals...going in the garbage.	-1
The picture on the box and the pictures on the Amazon webpage are completely off for the Tan cover. In the pic it looks dark.  It is very light in color. The quality seems good so if you are looking for a light tan color, this may be the product for you.	-1
Here is what will happen if you buy this product:  1: When you take it out of the box you will look at it and touch it and think "Wow, this feels and looks great!"  2: You will spend about 90 minutes destroying your fingers with a needle and realize you're only 1/4 of the way done. (I started using pliers to pull/push the needle through)  3: When you get to the first spoke you will realize that there is no way on God's green Earth that this thing is going to lay flat across the spokes.  4: You will continue lacing on the other side of the first spoke, hoping beyond hope that the cover will lay flat over the spoke.  Alas, this is not the case.  5: Overcome with disgust and shame, you will give up and cut off this cover and throw it in the trash.  This cover looks fine on the round parts of the wheel.  But when you get to a spoke, there's nothing holding it flat against the wheel, so it kind of bulges out and looks awful.  Don't waste your time or money.	-1
Did not have the chance to try super skin. Sadly I had to ship the item back as the needle to apply super-skin was not included.	-1
More junk from sunpro.  Bought this with the temp gauge.  The electrical connection popped off the top.  I called sunpro and it's on backorder.  "Send it back to us and we can get one to you in approximately 5 weeks!!!"  Don't buy this junk.	-1
I RECEIVED ITEM IN 8 DAYS. BOX OPENED OLD AND TAPED UP ALOT. MISSING PARTS NEEDLE AND THREAD. WRONG COLOR NOT TAUPE LOOK IN PICTURE BUT HONEY BROWN COLOR. WHICH EITHER COLOR IS OK. BUT NO NEEDLE OR THREAD! WHY? ADVERTISED AS LACE UP WITH NO LACE.. IT IS WHAT I WANTED BUT MISSING PARTS. ALSO THE ITEM IS VERY VERY OLD AND DRY. COULD HAVE BEEN CONDITIONED BEFORE SHIPPING. POOR PACKAGING TOO. REALLY NEEDED THIS ITEM.NOT AS ADVERTISED AT ALL. BUT IT IS LEATHER..REAL OLD OLD DRY LEATHER.. ALSO TO THOSE WHO ORDERED THIS ITEM PRIOR TO ME  THIS ITEM ALWAYS TAKES A LONG TIME TO LACE UP..IF YOU NEVER HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE AND DONT HAVE TIME THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF THING YOU WANT..A TRUE LEATHER LACE UP WHEEL COVER TAKES HOURS TO LACE UP.. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO CLASSY AND TOP GRADE LOOKING.. IT IS THE WORK PUT INTO PUTTING THE PRODUCT ON. DONT THINK THAT IT WILL BE REAL QUICK IT IS NOT A QUICK FIX.. IT IS AN ART AND A TIME TAKING ONE IF YOU GET THE PART AND NEEDLE AND THREAD THAT COMES WITH THE PRODUCT.. AND YOU HAVE TO PUT LEATHER ON AND LET IT STRETCH TO FIT OR IT WILL BE BAGGY..I HAVE LACE MANY OF THIS TYPE OF ITEM ON MY CARS IN MY LIFETIME IT IS A VERY TEDIOUS ART NOT SOMETHING YOU JUST THROW ON THERE..SMILES	-1
The size on this is very unclear. Unfortunately it's way too small to use on my toyota corolla.  Needs to be used on a really narrow steering wheel.	-1
This is nowhere near as supple as the picture on the box would have you believe.  In fact, it's about as rough as the stock steering wheel that I wanted to cover up.  I'll be returning this product.  At least I found out I don't like it before I installed it.	-1
So I bought and tried this and was terribly disappointed. The leather looks really cheap. The install was cumbersome but not 4 hours like some claimed...but it does take a good 1.5h maybe 2 if you are slow. I also didn't find the needles to be low quality, or the holes to be too small. That part was fine, it's the quality of the leather and the thread that looks cheap. The stitching just looks incredibly cheap as well. If you have a nice car, and want to give it a even nicer look, this is not for you.	-1
Sewn seam was crooked and split when I started installing it.  Check it carefully to make sure the seam is centered before putting it on.  Edit:  The replacement is COMPLETELY different than the defective original.  Most visibly, the stitching is hidden.  It's not nearly as tight (though the box says the same size), and half-way through installation was gapping away from the wheel.  I wrestled it back somewhat, but then the skip stitching around the spokes gapped.  I'm going to cut it off, re-sew one of the seams (make it smaller) and try again.  It must be SUPER tight when starting to prevent the end-fold/gapping other people complained about.  Temporarily securing it several places around with tiny zip-ties helps too.  The thread isn't waxed cord, but common multi-fil polyester, like flat yarn.  If you snag it with a needle, it frays.	-1
Total garbage. #1 you search on amazon for atv exhaust heat shield wrap, wanting to wrap your pipes on a quad and this pops up as a suggestion. Seems like just the right amount of material for the job. Wrap it up, looks great. Fire it up, smokes like crazy. No instructions, in small print in a hard to see place on the package it says not for use on exhaust pipes or headers. Lets be vague, right? The package is not shown in the listing, and it's the last line of the description, yet it was the first item in the search Que. WASTE OF MONEY. even the water hose I wrapped next to the header unravelled after idling for 5 minutes.	-1
It was a pain to get this thing on just to realize it looks ugly.  Save yourself some time and money, don't buy this and look for a different type or get one installed professionally.  I purchased a different one that was easy to install and looks good.	-1
This doesn't work for the exhaust because it has rubber and it burns.	-1
Doesn't really work that well, andthe adhesive is not that great for what it costs I expected more. Bla hkal kn	-1
make sure you get right size . the cover does not come with a backing/pad so it winds up being to big to tighten around steering wheel. I got the middle size to fit a full size crown victoria and it was to big after i cut the old cover off.	-1
Could not get over 3 PSI and was closer to 1 PSI. Engine would not run over an idle. Called Holley tech line and they concluded the pump was defective. Returned the pump. On the positive side,,,, Amazon did promptly refund the cost and shipping, as well as return shipping.  Although the Holley pump was defective,, I am very happy with Amazon and the return action.	-1

Raised vehicle to 'un-compress' springs. Between shock absorber interference and etc, could NOT install. I suspect a coil springer compressor and perhaps even removal may be necessary- Check your vehicle's clearance first!	-1
Was unable to install very easily.  After installing I noticed that they were moving.  Removed them as they didn't do much for raising the front end of my 96 f150	-1
the spacer is too long for the front stock spring/shock. it will interfere with the shock boot. height is ok but it's too long.	-1
Way overpriced for what it is, it is a solid mount but way overpriced for what it is.  The one I received did not include the longer stud, and does not allow any adjustment. Mine went back and I used the Spectre Performance 24283 Throttle Cable Bracket instead,  this bracket may not be as stout as the Holley one but it does allow adjustment for the mounting of the throttle and TV cable for custom applications and the chrome looks better IMHO.	-1
I switched out my Napa pump to put in a high quality pump, the worst mistak ever! I used the pump 3 months seemed good then it started shutting off from overheating. I contacted Holley online, they went back & forth trying to implicate I had done something wrong installing, when I told my Napa pump works just fine they informed me they had 1 yr warranty with proof of purchase. I did not have receipt anymore, so my loss. Quality in these pumps are not what Holley used to be & customer service is horrible. They just wanted me to buy a different pump for $200. LOL, I went back to my Napa pump with no probs maybe try summit or edelbrock. Search online problems with this pump & you will see alot of complaints of same problems with this pump & Holley not admitting to a flaw. Not good going over 100mph & engine starts shutting down from your pump not working, turn it off for a few minutes & pump starts working again. I thought they had good products, sad my $65 Napa is more reliable!	-1
The foil itself is pretty good quality, but the glue in it just dries up after exposed to high engine heat after a week or so.  Bad design.	-1
Sticky material is pretty weak	-1
Allot of money for so little of space	-1
Bought one for my 69 stang. worked and looked great for about 1 and 1/2 years. now it only will read after 1500 rpm. checked and re-installed wires and changed my ground to make sure that it was my tach and not installer error. Still the same problems. They work good for  awhile if you need a cheap temp tach. i will be looking into an equus or an autometer tach next. You get what you pay for.	-1
This is a steal. A little piece of paper very slim. Very pricey.	-1
did not work at all	-1
Description fails to mention that the adhesive is rated to only 300 degrees F; it says so right on the package.  This really should be in the product description, as it limits where the product can be used.  I can't use it where I was going to (inside turbo heat shield), as I'm afraid the adhesive might catch fire.	-1
it doesn't work  yes I have it hooked up correctly. I know that I have power and ground connected correctly because the light comes on when I turn on the headlights. But it doesn't read the RPM. The needle doesn't even move when the truck is turned on. I have the correct wire plugged into the correct port on my HEI distro, and I triple checked it.  I'm pretty sure it's faulting wiring inside this cheap little thing...	-1
cheap plastic	-1
Sunpro makes the cheapest junk I have ever seen. Just complete crap.  It couldn't have cost them more than $3 to make and package this.	-1
Will not stick very poor product wasted my money	-1
Hm...perhaps it's the way it was packed and the heat it must have gone through to get here, but the adhesive is NOT very strong for me!	-1
TOOK ALOT TO GET IT IN PLACE IN MY PICUP, THEN STARTED TEARING, THE SMELL OF THE RUBBER IT WAS MADE OF WAS HORRIBLE! EVEN AFTER WE LEFT IT ON 6 MONTHS THE SMELL WAS STILL THERE!!!, TOOK IT OFF AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THE SMELL OFF THE STEERING WHEEL EVEN AFTER USEING CLEANING PRODUCTS...NEVER AGIN...	-1
Bought this for 6 bucks months ago  Highly recommended..... if you have no love for your sense of smell  This thing reeks.  I washed this thing multiple times with soap and water. Baked this thing in the sun for days. Placed it in a sealed bag with baking soda and tried multiple cleaning solutions and recommendations I could find in the internet to try and get rid of that smell. Nothing worked  Finally gave up and left it in the garage in a sealed bag.  Months later it still smells, not as bad as it used to ( used to fill a room or car with its stench ) but bad enough that if you actually held it, the smell would transfer to your hand. ( And its a steering wheel cover )  It was cheap, but the time and effort wasted plus the money i spent buying cleaning agents totally negated whatever small saving I was hoping to get.  Just go to a store where you can actually handle (and smell) the steering wheel cover and pay the extra couple of bucks.	-1
The product has very strong odor, you can't wash it off from your hands with soap and water just doing it once.  The whole car is full of the smell of vinil or whatever it made of.  Make my wife and kids throw up.  Walking into Wal-mart, you will find product with thicker padded soft material and odorless, no need to drive with all windows down.	-1
Not really what you would call sports grip and NOT AT ALL A SLIP ON. Expect to struggle with this to get it on. And forget about even getting it on if your wheel is too big, by too big I mean extra small.	-1
Disassembled gauges to put in glowshift pillar pod and they jump back and forth will have figure out something else to put in	-1
missing parts	-1
Since my fuel gauge is not working anymore, I decide to remove the Sunpro tank level that I've bough a year ago. I find out that the end of the lever is a spring capped by a steel button which is touching the potentiometer made of fine wire. Imagine a boat sitting on a floating dock constantly moving up and down and the hard steel button would ripped apart the potentiometer wire. The part touching the wire should be made of soft copper, not hard steel ...Please stay away buying parts that are to cheap and made in China. I've bought also a cheap Sea-Dog kill switch and it is falling apart too ...	-1
the diameter of the shaft was too large to allow insertion into the existing hole in my fuel tank.very disappointed.	-1
There's no such thing as a "Glasspack Muffler".  A Muffler is designed to quiet your Exhaust, to a LEGAL decibel level.  A Glasspack is designed to Barely do anything at all.  Glasspacks are not Mufflers, and Mufflers are not Glasspacks.  I have repeatedly told Amazon about this issue, but they refuse to change their ways, and ensure a "Tell The Truth" policy.	-1
This is a huge problem if you are concerned about performance. Anyone can make a smaller pipe and get "muffled" sound. The idea should be Inner Diameter to match the Innter Diameter of the core. Thrush has failed to do so. If you need correct Inner Diameter, step up in size of Thrush muffler.	-1
not worth the money I spent. The mirrors will not stay put and drift. also the rubber came off and my door got scratched. I bought some bolt on plug and play mirror from tyger. I was very happy with those.	-1
Does not fit dodge Durango. 4 inches to short on door.  But otherwise put together very well.	-1
suction cup didn't hold well fell off window and broke one of the arms	-1
no good	-1
The ONLY reason I give it one star is that this mirror was not high enough to be seen over the windshield wiper of my F250.  For my uses, it also didn't extend out from the fender far enough to add any visibility on the right side of the camper in tow. . For cars of jeeps towing a boat or utility trailer this would be great.  Two legs set in the hood-well of the vehicle, and the third leg rests on the fender outside.  It is quickly removed, though it stays where you put it when traveling at highway speeds.  No problems.	-1
After just 450 miles teh wind had loosened the mirrors so much they refused to tighten again.  Once loose they were impossible to adjust thus totally unusable. Beware if your buying these for long distances.  I had to stop at a truck stop and hardware store to get replacement mirrors to get me home.... The design of the mounting bracket is acceptable and of good quality material the mirrors are simply not usable	-1
Don't get fooled by 2 by 2 It's very very small Mines even fall off after 3 days !	-1
As a mirror that looks like stock, with good clarity and optics, this hit all the marks. Unfortunately it also hit the highway somewhere between my work and home. The adhesive failed and it was not the side I applied, in fact, that bond is still holding. The one the manufacturer would be responsible for however did fail. I left it as two stars instead of 1 since it may work fine if you get your own double sided trim tape and use that after taking the tape that it comes with completely off.	-1
Plastic body bolt fell out mirror fell off. For those that gave good reviews. Great for trucks sitting in driveway. Drive your truck 3 months and 30+ adjustments and they give up completely. The housing on the bottom cannot get tight enough. Even when I added a biteing washer.	-1
Lasted 3 days , found laying dead on carport floor in numerous pieces (yes it is made of glass). Had taken great pains to clean truck mirror, alcohol scrub, window cleaner, clean microfiber cloth.  Sticky tapes that were supposed to hold only left scant traces of adhesive around perimeter of each of two tapes, less than 1% of grip surface.  Had just ordered two more of these, arrive tomorrow. Where can you safely put a glass mirror that may fall without warning ???  Toolbox!	-1
This mirror widens your view but makes things really distorted and small.  The size of the mirror is pretty big and it was a little weird that you have a large mirror that makes everything small.  And just be careful because objects in the mirror are WAY CLOSER than they appear.  Basically if you look in the mirror and it seems like the cars are quite a distance behind you, it actually means is that the car is RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.  The distortion makes this not really useful.  If you want a mirror to extend your peripheral vision, go with a smaller mirror that complements your existing side mirror.  If you are looking for a replacement mirror (it's big enough to be a full side mirror), look for one that has a normal view.	-1
Glue was not a good idea for exposed side mirrors.  After a week in Texas sun, it fell off while parked in my garage.  I was not able to it stick back on.  I followed the instruction and wiped the mirror area clean before installing the mirror.  It just was not a good design for external use.	-1
Size is too big for stick on side mirror.reduce the size	-1
Just doesn't work well on my Pickup truck mirrors.  The plain old round ones that I had were better.	-1
I thought this would be better than the circular style..i don't like the large black piece that walls of the mirror. went out and bought a round one, same size...much better.	-1
Don't know what got into my head to buy this - must ne temporary insanity. Installation means you have to hook this onlt your widow sill (where there is weatherstripping) and then brace the bottom on the outer door skin. Well I partially installed this on one side before deciding that this was not for my newer truck. Still can't believe I bought this. I them bought CIPA clip on mirrors to strap onto my truck's mirrors - another fail, since it vibrated too much. Used that for one trip before buying aftermarket OEM-style extendable truck mirrors for my Sierra - perfection in rearward visibility.	-1
The adhesive is terrible on these.  Might as well ship them without it to avoid the cleanup mess.	-1
returned did not work on my truck	-1
The item is height and width are 2".  But the depth is a little obnoxious at almost 1/2" and sticks out from the mirror.  I preferred something a little less conspicuous.	-1
Did not work for me.	-1
The double back tape did not hold and it fell off in a few days. Good news is it fell off in my driveway.	-1
I use these for my desk in my cube but each one (ordered 2) has a wierd deformed spot toward one end of it, because of this distortion it was giving me a headache just out of my peripheral.  Due to this I had to take one of the mirrors down just to ease my headaches.  I still have one up but if I knew they all had this deformed spot I would've either looked elsewhere or done a few flat mirrors.  I guess it is what you get for wanting something cheap.	-1
it shacks when driving car	-1
Absolute garbage. CIPA and Pilot mirrors are POS. When you try to tighten the mirror up so it doesn't flop in the wind, or aim at the sky.....(one day mine started to spin). The tensioner (plastic) breaks inside......And then you need to return it only to get another one that does the very same thing. Absolute garbage.	-1
Gives a bad angle. Took them off after just a few days.	-1
This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.  They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.  To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.  Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.  Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.  Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.  I'm sending them back.	-1
Its horrible. the few is distorted and wavy in the daytime, haven't tried it at night. The original was 11 inches and Ididn't think it would be the big a deal but it is.  This is going back the Amazon.	-1
Woulda been nice to know it doesnt come with adhesive	-1
These work ok, kinda too small. Also there is a haze in the corner of one. I should of looked around more.	-1
I thought I was getting a good deal on this on Amazon I wanted something different than the Circle ones. I thought it came with two but only Has one should have paid attention to details. But safe your Money and go buy it from Autozone for 3$	-1
After installing the mirror twice, once with just the set screw and a second time with a shim between the mirror and the mount, I found that I could not eliminate the mirror from vibrating.  Additionally, the image was not sharp.  I subsequently replaced it with a Donnelly mirror, which uses a clamp rather than a set-screw, and the new mirror is sharp and does not vibrate.	-1
cool	-1
Can't find an acceptable blind spot mirror for my Honda Pilot.  Put one of these (3-1/4 X 3-1/4 in.) on the driver's door...lower outside, where there's nothing to see anyway, and it was great until the cheap plastic on the mirror started coming off on the inside.  Lasted about 4-5 months.  It's the second of these (from local auto store) I've had in a year.  The circular ones just take up too much room (the bigger ones) on the rear view mirror, and the smaller ones are useless.  Still looking for a good solution.  (I still curse Honda for not putting one on the outside rear view mirror in the first place...but the Honda Pilot is an entirely other poor-design story.)	-1
I ordered this mirror to replace the broken one in my car. I specifically ordered this one because I wanted a larger one. First, as other reviewer mentioned this mirror is 11" rather than 12". Second, after I installed it and did a test drive, I discovered that this mirror shakes like crazy. To the point that it makes it hard to see anything and gives you a headache. Returned to Amazon. As always thanks to Amazon.com for excellent service.	-1
This mirror was super small.  I would definitely recommend buying one larger than 8''.  It works but it is to small.	-1
Very wobbly doesnt sit right. You will constantly be adjusting this	-1
Deceptive in my words. Most blind spot mirrors sell in pairs. Not these. Don't be fooled.. You only get one.........One? What the heck do you need only One for? I'm not too happy. I can't return a $4 item. Live and learn I guess. Well, hopefully you will learn, I lived. Would I buy again? Heck no. Mine will be tossed in the trash. They have the similar mirrors (2/Pair that is) at Walmart for the same price. I pick my replacements up there.	-1
This mirror isn't 10" it measures 9" across the bottom and 8" across the top and it's narrower in the middle than the ends. Nothing like the picture, not at all what I wanted.	-1
Mirror is not horizontally stable. Light touch knocks it out of position. Would not recommend.	-1
I wanted a wider rear view mirror than the stock one in my vehicle, plus the existing one being 20 years old had seen better days.  Unfortunately, this product is terrible.  During the day the mirror is so warped that when you look into it, it's like looking into a funhouse mirror that has the side effect of making you feel like you want to vomit.  The mirror on my model was so bad that the left side makes the world look like it's partially wrapped around a soap bubble while the left is clear.  It gets worse at night, but the toggle switch to switch from day to night use doesn't have enough travel.  As a result you see the normal mirror image showing you the roof of your car as well as the second image of the "night" mirror.  Worse, with the short roof of my pickup truck, I can see the top 2-3" of my rear window, so you get a partial view of the sky, mixed in with all the street lights and traffic signals wizzing past too.  Add on top of that the "funhouse mirror" effect you carry over from daytime and looking in the rear view mirror at night is probably similar to a bad acid trip.  So, unless you did LSD in your youth and want to relive a bad trip, stay away from this rear view mirror.	-1
returned it, would not mount and stay on	-1
This product does not have the "Standard Size" windshield attachments. It should be as easy as removing the old one with a turn of a screw, putting the new one in its place, and tightening. When ordering this product you will have to remove the windshield attachment and replace with the one that fits this product. I was very unhappy about this .... However, the quality of the rearview mirror was great ...	-1
First one was junk.  The mirror was loose.  Also, the button supplied would never hold on glass.  The mounting surface is NOT flat and is cheap cast metal.  The second one was not loose, but still vibrates too much.  I went back to the original one.	-1
Seems to be a good product but would not work on a 96 range rover p38 . Tried to use the glue and would not stick . A real shame as I asked for refund . Amazon is good but figguring what will work is lacking .	-1
let me be clear the product is made well.. the problem is I have a 2005 Dakota and turns out is one of the mirror set ups that seems to have an issue.. if you own a Dakota do not buy this style!!! Also if you buy from Amazon in the winter find a warm place and try as soon as you get it.. I waited for warmer weather and now Amazon says its past the return date!	-1
I have a 2003 Dodge Dakota and even though this says universal fit and the part guide says it will work this is not a good fit for my truck	-1
I got these for an F-150 as they seemed to look a bit better than the round versions.  They do look better but don't work nearly as well.  Regardless of how I positioned it, I could never get the one on the passenger side to work well.  The round versions provide much better visibility over the blind-spots on the truck.  Go for the round version.	-1
I though the shape and design were going to be winners, but the inside edge is over 1/2" thick. Should taper from 1/8", etc.  Mounted them and the 1/2" + height is too much. Way too thick.  Tossed these and got thin stick on mirrors.	-1
It broke within a month of light use between two drivers changing the mirror.	-1
It didn't fit my 99 Toyota Tacoma very well...lots of jiggle. The mirror fell off one of the two that I purchased after less than 20 miles. More junk from China.	-1
sorry mirror u don't fit and/or stay put!	-1
Wobbly piece of junkque.	-1
This thing vibrates so bad that I added it to my wife's nightstand collection.....JK, it will be returned.	-1
The 8" size is perfect for a Miata, but the mirror itself is junk.  It is loose in the ball socket (not adjustable) and vibrates non-stop going down the road.  It's going to the trash as soon as the OEM replacement mirror arrives.	-1
Hard to put on and adjust.	-1
These mirrors will not securely tighten. They start loosening the minute you drive down the road.	-1
rubbish quality	-1
So this mirror was interesting to say the least. Install and shipping and everything went fine. After the installation was a different story. This particular mirror has some type of weird visual effect replicating vertigo when you look into it. Everything seems further than it should, and it literally makes you feel disoriented for the first week or so of use. Easy to clean though	-1
This is a piece of junk.! The straps stretch, the plastic clips slip off while tightening, and the dam things fall off while driving. Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on.  They do work well.	-1
CIPA 11960 Premium Universal Towing Mirror will not fit a 2014 KIA Sorento. That will avoid others from making the purchase and the hassle of it not fitting the car and returning it. DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE THIS CAR.	-1
Will not stay on, metal hooks bend too easy. I was even referred to these from CIPA. I opened one, the other will be returned.	-1
Terrible quality mirror. Didn't know it was possible to make a bad mirror, well this one is bad. Picture is distorted.	-1
These tow mirrors have a web clamp that hooks on your existing mirror. When they are tightened, the clips tend to snap off and you start over again. In use at highway speeds, they have two problems: 1. They slip down out of position. Dangerous to re adjust while driving, Fail!  2. The web straps make a high pitched sound that is louder than your high end sound system. Fail! I cannot recommend these especially there are other style CIPA tow mirrors that work great. Check out the cipa mirrors that slide on. They are too fine.	-1
Bought this for my old Jeep Cherokee because it was a toss up between this mirror and a factory overhead console.  I figured that this mirror would be a nice upgrade - my main purpose behind installing it was to get the outside temp display but the compass, map lights, and electrochromic mirror were also nice touches (and you wouldn't get the EC mirror with the factory overhead console, even if you can find one in a junkyard for a reasonable price.)  So I go to install it and discover that the mirror has the capability of having the map lights wired to the dome light so that they work as auxiliary dome lights.  Additionally there is an optional "reverse inhibit" function for the auto-dim.  BUT neither the wires nor the instructions for either are included in with the mirror, and CIPA/MagnaDonnelley wants you to buy another wiring kit for an extortionate price.  Out of the box the map lights only function as map lights, and only when the ignition key is on.  If you just add two more wires then the map lights always function (but the auto-dim, outside temp. display and compass only work with the key on, as it should be) and one more wire connected to the reverse light circuit will enable the "reverse inhibit" feature.  In CIPA/MagnaDonnelley's defense they will send you the instructions if you ask for them however.  Here is an OCR of the first page of the instructions, shamelessly stolen from another forum where someone's already been through this...  PROCEDURE TO WIRE MIRROR TO FUNCTION AS COURTESY LAMPS Applications: CIPA part numbers 36300, 36301, 36400, 36401, 36500, 36501 It is possible to connect mirror to your vehicle in a way that the map lamps will come on with the door courtesy lamps.  DOOR SWITCH CONNECTION 1. You will have to find the circuit that controls the door lamp function. 2. This circuit must go to ground when the door opens which is common on many cars but not all. My understanding is that the Corvette is positive 12 V when door is open. If courtesy lamp circuit is +12 Volts then a relay needs to be wired into the mirror harness. 3. A second power harness needs to be purchased (CIPA Part Number 36100WIRE). 4. The fused wire is stripped from the non fused ground wire. The ground lead is thrown away. 5. The fused lead is then tapped into the courtesy lamp control circuit using a wire T-Tap (Scotch Loc). 6. The wire is routed up around the instrument panel, up the `A' pillar to the mirror. 7. The door control wire is connected to pin position 6 on the connector that plugs into the mirror.  The power harness, T-Tap and wire ties should be purchased through your local retailer or CIPAUSA.com. CIPA Part Number 36100WIRE contains: 1 Power Harness (Power and ground wires) 1 T-Tap 5 wire ties  We do not offer a ready made relay to make the mirror work with positive door switch systems. Refer to form "How to add a relay to + 12 V courtesy circuit for mirror light courtesy function" Pin Function 1 Ignition controlled 12 volts 2 Ground 3 Reverse Inhibit (optional use). 4 Temperature wire 1 (PN 36500 and 36501 only) 5 Temperature wire 2 (PN 36500 and 36501 only) 6 Ground when door is open. Door switch for courtesy light function. (Optional) 7 Ignition controlled 12 V or to battery if courtesy light function is desired.  POWER CONNECTION Pin 7 needs to go to a constant 12 volt source to have the map lamps function in the courtesy mode when the ignition is turned off. The power harness that comes with your mirror kit has a jumper wire between pin 1 and pin 7 to reduce the number of standard hook ups required. To wire pin 7 to constant 12 volts; 1. Obtain fused power wire PN 36100WIRE from CIPA. 2. Remove terminal from pin location 7 in the connector. 3. Tape over or cut off short jumper wire that goes from pin 1 to pin 7. Leave pin 1 connected to ignition controlled power source. 4. Locate a 12 volt constant power source. Best if power source is on the battery save circuit so if lights are left on they will shut off after 15 minutes when the car is not turned on. 5. The fused wire is stripped from the non fused ground wire. The ground lead is thrown away. 6. The fused lead is then tapped into the power circuit using a wire T-Tap (Scotch Loc). 7. Run the power wire from the source to the mirror following the other installed mirror wiring. 8. Insert the terminal into position 7 of the black connector. 9. Plug connector into mirror. 10. Test courtesy function of mirror.  MY NOTE: the post that I copied this from referenced an eBay source for the harnesses, but they are apparently no longer currently selling them. Searching for the Cipa "36100Wire" part gave me sticker shock. I should have to pay $50-60 to hook up a $160 (through Amazon, apparently $300+ list) mirror? I DO NOT THINK SO.  OK, so I get on the interwebs trying to find what the connector on the back is.  [...]  appears to have the correct connectors  I ordered from digi-key a female connector body JST VHR-7N (just because it was cheap and I wanted to verify for future reference that it worked) and the individual female sockets are either SVH-41T-P1.1 or SVH-21T-P1.1 (difference is range of wire gauges accepted)  NOTE: YOU WILL NEED A WEATHERPACK/W-TYPE/EURO STYLE CRIMP TOOL TO PROPERLY INSTALL THESE CONNECTORS (but it's still cheaper than buying the harness that they want you to buy)  I received the parts, verified that they actually work, and now I have it wired up...  Guess what?  I haven't had this mirror in my Jeep for a year yet and already it's continually rebooting as I drive down the road.  I initially thought that it was the connection to power - I had used Scotch-Locks to tap into the adapter harness for my car stereo - but when I replaced the head unit with a newer one I took the opportunity to use soldered splices and heat shrink since I had to rework the adapter harness.  It's still doing it and it's only getting worse.  I really like the mirror when it's working correctly.  It's aggravating that I spent so much time and energy getting it installed and instead of giving me useful information it annoyingly flashes at me as I'm driving down the road.  I'm going to contact Amazon CS and see if they'll trade it out for me as I really do like the mirror... when it's not rebooting constantly.	-1
The mirrors worked well for half my first trip.....after that they started to sag.  The mirrors are about half the size of my tacoma's mirrors, so, they work but have a limited field of view.  After 5 trips on these mirrors, the adjusting belts gave way when I tried to tighten them down.  I will not be buying these again.	-1
Nice idea but cheaply made. The clips that hold the mirror on broke on the first trip out.  I returned them and am looking for a more durable solution.	-1
Works OK, but has wavy lines in mirror like it's 100 year old glass. Not very satisfied with it.	-1
This thing is a piece of junk. Day/Night my butt. If I hadn't waited so long to put it on, I'd return the POS. Save your money and go with a bigger/better one like OEM for your vehicle. Oh yeah, save your money. Can I leave 0 stars? No? Darn.	-1
this are the crapiest and cheapest mirrors I have ever seen, I actually threw them away , I got 2 of them for some reason and I literally broke both on purpose and threw them away. The plastic is cheap, the look on them is cheap, the way it moves is cheap, it sounds and feels like its going to break, and  its hard to adjust. I didn't even try mounting it, I will purchase oem mirror, I guess you get what you pay for, it cost me $5.95 and again it brought 2 exact mirrors in the box for some reason, I was going to give them away but couldn't think of anyone I hated that much to give this garbage to. I wouldn't recommend this unless your extremely desperate.	-1
He did not reach his sound and arrived empty of liquid	-1
This mirror looks and feels cheap compared to the OEM mirror on my 1997 Pontiac Grand prix gtp. The glass vibrates slightly when going over any kind of uneven surface and after a few weeks of use the mirror doesn't sit securely on the adjusting "ball" that moves when you adjust the position of the mirror so the mirror kind of dangles and moves around slightly when you drive. This is exactly why I try to avoid "Made in China" Products. I bought a good used original mirror to replace this one and its much better now.	-1
It arrived scratched.  I contacted the supplier and they never responded.  Although it's fairly low cost, this thing must have cost nickels to manufacture so the few bucks you spend are all profit.  It's too small.  I'd recommend 4" for this type of unit.  If I had known what a disappointment it would be, I would have purchased a small mirror at Walmart along with some double sided tape.  Don't waste your money or your time with this product.	-1
Good quality product but does not fasten securely to my 4rnr mirror. Even with duct tape, it would not maintain a usable position.	-1
These mirrors won't fit a 2008 Ford Expedition (Eddie Bauer) with turn signals. Although the two outboard feet are adjustable, the Expedition mirror housing is too curved to get a good purchase. Also, the bottom lip near the turn signal is too shallow for the CIPA clip to get a good grip and it will bend under tension.	-1
Not bad for the price. I used these mirrors for a few months & they did serve thier purpose. My biggest complaint would be the vibration while driving making the viewing area hard to see. A bit scary while changing lanes on the interstate pulling a 30' travel trailer. I ended up purchasing the slide on CIPA mirrors that were made specifically for my vehicle wich are much better.	-1
Did not fit the bracket on my Tundra like they said.  Actually cracked the windshield trying to replace the old bracket.  So after I purchase a new windshield now, the mirror should work.  Should have just went to Tundra dealership and would have been cheaper than replacing windshield!	-1
When I first received this it was a great mirror.  The main mounting piece was metal and therefore not easy to break like many non factory rear view mirrors.  It was nice and tight and worked well.  6 month later and the quality has shown.  It became so lose that the mirror would flop around.  The arm that mounts to the back of the mirror is what became lose.  I was bale to get the actual glass mirror out of the plastic housing and found a lose nut on the connecting arm bolt.  That is the part that comes lose.  It looks like it was not installed with locktight, only hand tightened.  Therefore there is a risk of it coming lose at some point.  I cranked that nut down and it works fine.  I had to really work on getting that glass out.  I took a heat gun to the housing in order to soften it so I could pry the glass out.  In doing so it has ruined the look of the plastic housing and its shape is a little deformed.  Until this manufacturer installs the parts with Locktight, I would stay away from it.	-1
Was looking to put these on my Ford F150...and they are just too small.  I should have read the size closer before ordering.	-1
1. The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.  2. I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it. The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible.  WD40 did not work, neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.  3. So if you try to adjust the mirror after it's mounted, you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.  4. When adjusting the mirror, the day/night button kept flipping on/off.  Very annoying.  5. The mirror surface itself is very good, no ripples.	-1
I have bought several of these trying to find one where the surface is not scratched.  I'm still looking, but haven't yet found one.  The problem is that the packaging is such that the surface of the mirror is not protected and they are prone to being scratched during shipment / transport.  Functionally, unless the scratched area is large, the mirrors still function.  I'm picky ... I want to put a convex mirror on a show car that is not scratched.	-1
In one month they have started to rust, not the best choice out there.	-1
Product spilled all over the inside of the shipping box, and after reading online I see that you can use dish soap, Simple Green, laundry detergent & soda water, all kinds of stuff and people have great results. Before you buy this, Google 'Instead of K&N cleaner' & read what people are saying...	-1
Very cheap plastic.	-1
Well this is an interesting design choice.  They make a solid metal, well made, beautiful Chevy "bow-tie."  Then they give you a two piece, flimsy plastic insert.  Yes two pieces.  So I super glued the two pieces together and screwed the bow-tie on.  Looks great.  Problem.  If you use a non-locking hitch pin to secure this, you might make two trips to any parking lot anywhere USA and it will be gone in sixty seconds.  If someone kicks it thats the game, it will easily break off.  Or...if you have a locking hitch pin all anyone needs to do is twist the bow-tie and it will break away from the flimsy plastic insert.  Your only solace will be the offender will have to adapt this to something to re-use it.  Now if no one rips it off, you don't accidently kick it then it may stay on your truck for about 3 to 6 months.  Here is why....the plastic insert is so flimsy that with normal driving I am certain the screw holes in the plastic will begin to crack and one day you will hear a clinking sound, look in your rear view mirror and your bow-tie will be bouncing down the road.  So spend an extra 15 to 20 bucks and buy an all metal piece.  Now if you don't plan to drive your vehicle it looks great.  If you own a dealership and want to dress up a display vehicle this would be OK.  My only solace in this purchase is I had a 30 dollar credit coming so the cover and a locking hitch pin cost me only 14 bucks and some change.  So when the cover gets ripped off or falls off the truck the money I paid was less then what the locking hitch pin cost.  When that happens Ill get an all metal cover.  Looks great, not practical and certainly not durable.  (i.e. a waste of time and money)  Even an aluminum insert would improve this piece.  I cant imagine what the manufacturer of this piece was thinking.  Its made in Taiwan I believe so I suspect everytime they sell one they laugh and say silly Americans.  If it were not for the 30 dollar credit I had coming I would have been pissed and returned this or thrown it in the trash to avoid the hassle of returning this piece of crap.	-1
Terrible packaging. It leaked because the box was to big and nothing to take up the space.	-1
the product is good i have used it many times, however the package arrived damaged and did not have time to resend it. the package was leaking and the problem was its top seal was very bad quality,	-1
Only plus is the small pocket for your phone if it fits...downside is you have to cut a ton of tabs...including the x x in the middle of the din. Why? if you make a mistake and cut the wrong tab you outta luck...so make sure you don't do that.	-1
the keychain is absolutely massive. way to big to be used on most keychains.  Really awkward size.  but would be great if it was smaller	-1
Simple as that, way too big for a key chain, unless your into that kind of thing. Good quality.	-1
Per Metra's installation instructions, I removed all but three screw  tabs to match the factory radio mounting locations.  Even in harsh off-road conditions the these three screw anchor points were adequate for my factory radio,  three anchor points are not sufficient to keep the metra kit from twisting and flexing. if you have access from below, i recommend using the strap that is included with your new head unit to support the rear. i don't have access from below to mount the strap.  my new head unit is a single DIN DVD.  i will not buy this product again.	-1
Purchased this kit to install a single din pioneer head unit in a 96 Plymouth Voyager.  The kit would not fit in the opening no matter how I turned it.  Even after trimming certain pieces of the kit, the kit still doesn't fit correctly.  Don't waste your on this kit.	-1
after getting the box, it was clear that my bottle of cleaner was busted as the entire bottom half was soaked! There was only half the bottle left when I did finally pull it from its soggy grave... I returned it immediately. Amazon packaged it terribly so be warned that if you order this item, it might come in busted and leaking.	-1
This does not fit a 1987 dodge ram or ramcharger like it says buyer beware	-1
Not impressed. Started skipping out of the box. In all fairness, we use RainX wiper fluid. So, thought that could be the issue. Cleaned wipers with rubbing alcohol. That improved the wiper performance, but even with brand new windshield and no use of fluid, back to skipping. Won't be buying these again.	-1
Horrible, just horrible. Screaches across the windows. Returned.	-1
Main mounting tab to body on top broke.	-1
Nice design, cheap made!	-1
It is not a full installation kit. Keep on looking if you want to install your radio. What people would need to install a stereo install a video, are factory metal brackets, full installation kit, Amazon uses I believe Metra kits... The price should be around fifteen to twenty dollars, the full kit. The last thing this is needed is the product that is in need to be installed. My stereo system was taken back and forth to the technician about three time. Because I didn't have the right equipment. Please make everyone has all that was mention above.	-1
Not the same as the old silblades that I loved.  Wish they were, but I was disappointed.  I ended up throwing them away and putting the OEM blades back on.	-1
Doesn't fit a 2002 Jeep Wrangler as advertised.	-1
Nice quality but ended up not using on my key ring because it's noisy when driving	-1
Do not like silicone on my windshield.	-1
It fits, but it's not as deep as it should be. It also tapers off.	-1
Only 3.5" deep.  It should be 6" deep or more to fill a DIN slot.  Like, what's the point of such a small pocket?  It can't even hold a CD.  What does the manufacturer think we're going to use it to store, floppy disks?  A pack of cigarettes?  Sheesh.  Oh, and the package mine came in claimed "ALL BRACKETS INCLUDED."  I notice the package in the photo on Amazon says "ALL NECESSARY BRACKETS INCLUDED."  How many brackets were included?  ZERO.  NADA.  NONE.	-1
Inaccurate application guide ensured 1991 Cherokee fitment. Nope. No way. Ureturnable too now that I've tried.	-1
Garbage. Came with two thick molding inclusions blocking the opening (see picture). I am going on a five hour drive tomorrow and wanted to upgrade my old stock head unit on my 98 Jeep ZJ to have decent sound. Not gonna happen now. because this is going to look like garbage at the spots that had to be sawed. Nothing anywhere mentions to expect this so it's either dishonest advertising or whoever packed it was lazy or told to pack it anyway by supervisor.	-1
I've actually had multiple problems with theses blades, I have been using one side by side with the lowest quality $3 blade I could buy from walmart, and the $3 blade is doing a better job. The silblade doesn't appear to make very good contact with the windshield and streaks some of the water, I think this would only be a good product if you have a more flat windshield than I do. (1999 Mazda Miata) It also seems to jiggle loose every few weeks, and I do not experience this with the cheaper blades. And yes I do know I installed them properly.  All in all I do not think these blades live up to the premium price and you are better off just buying a $3 wiper every year, but perhaps if you have a a different windshield it may live up to it's claims, but if you drive a Miata, it will not.	-1
it only has the logo on 1 side, what the hell man. Can we be any more cheep. No I don't recommend it.	-1
Was to small for the rear window but it said it would fit	-1
chattery pieces of junk. I waited a few years watching this product and am disappointed I went with it. I have multiple sets on company rigs and they are almost as bad as goodyear wipers.	-1
Said it would fit my 96 dakota, but that's wrong.  Lots of cutting to make it close to fit	-1
A year and a half is being generous. I bought these in March of 2014 and in October 2015 I realized they haven't been performing well for awhile by streaking and chattering. I'm not sure what else I can say. Since they cost about twice as much I'd be happy if they lasted twice as long but sadly that is not the case. Oh well, let the buyer beware.	-1
waste of money left streaks after month of use and uneven pressure across the whole windshield, the old wipers had to be put back on these were so bad.	-1
the add did not say that it was only one wiper,  I ordered cause wipers are usually sold in pairs and I only got one so I did not used it	-1
Did not come with connectors so they are useless until I can find replacement connectors on my own.	-1
Streaky. 2008 infiniti m35x	-1
This has got to be the worst quality pin stripping I have ever used, it does not go on strait, it has waves in it and half of it won't even stay on. I am peeling what did stick off and going with something else.	-1
Did not fit the 99 jeep wrangle. Past the 30 day return policy, so I'm stuck with this thing	-1
Unit has no updated info beyond year 95. May work great but no info you can't install. Audiovox website no help! Sent back for refund.	-1
The piece delivered to me does not have the clips to install on wiper arm of the car, what purpose does it server if we cant install it. Was expecting a better qualify from this delivery	-1
The roll was short, everytime I tried peeling the paper from the striping it stuck.  wound up throwing the roll away.  Do not buy this product	-1
Update: Didn't last any longer than normal blades. It's been a year and a half and one of the blades has ripped.  I'll be using the cheap ones from now on.  Fit the 2012 Jeep perfectly.  Nice and quiet and cleans the windshield nicely.	-1
i would not purchase this for any thing it decides when it wants to work, i am a mechanic and have installed over 30 cruise controls i have went thru the directions which are very poor to see if i missed something no i missed nothing all cruise controls install pretty much the same way and this brand is junk oh ya their tech line is a joke these people are just reading from some internet sight	-1
If you are interested in purchasing an Audiovox CCS100 Cruise Control from Amazon, BE ADVISED that it really comes from MOTOGROUP of Jacksonville, FL, and there is absolutely NO PRODUCT SUPPORT from these people!!!  You receive your cruise control with NO WRITTEN WARRENTY, and INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS.  When contacted by phone, they informed me that I had only a 30 day warrenty and that they would return my phone call with possibly more help.  The phone call never came!!!  Page -1- of the instructions refers you to "the enclosed reference manual" for vehicle application.  I assume that is the installation manual, and there are no specific vehicle applications listed in this manual.  Bottom line--it doesn't work properly, and there is nothing to be done about it!!!  Note:  I have installed numerous cruise controls and other after-market items on various vehicles over the last 30 years of driving and have never had any difficulties with them--until NOW!  April 12, 2012-UPDATE:  Following the poor performance mentioned above, I tried another avenue.  I contacted Summit Racing Equipment who sell Rostra after-market cruise controls.  They were not only knowledgable about their products and knew which item I needed for my vehicle, but this kit came with all of the instructions and listed my vehicle in them.  WORKED FIRST TIME with no problems!!!  You even get a 36 month written warrenty, and a contact number for support.  This all-electric cruise control was only $20.00 more then the Audiovox, but Soooo much better to install!!!!  Try Summit!	-1
I have to say, after having these blades recommended to me I REALLY was expecting more but honestly they appear to be no better than any other higher end blade. Mine squeak and they are less then two weeks installed and I've cleaned the windshield too.... Not impressed.	-1
They don't fit all vehicles.  Check your application carefully	-1
It didn't even fit my 1998 Jeep Cherokee. Make sure you research things before you buy them.	-1
The blades left streaks and didn't fit my Acura TSX well. One of them was just a tiny bit long and would touch the rubber gasket of the windshield.  Acura has come up with a new blade and has priced it reasonably. The Acura part works much better than the Silblade units.	-1
Despite being advertised as "no drill installation" there aren't even mounting holes pre-drilled in the Challenger box! These cannot be mounted in any way without drilling both the box and your truckbed in multiple places. The boxes seemed rather thin. There was a lot of flex, and I felt that I could have pried them open with a pocketknife. I returned both the next day.	-1
Maybe it is because of my Jeep' s flat wind shield, but all work the same for me $6 or $20 wiper blades.	-1
Did not last 3 months before streaking, nevermind 3 years. At this price I thought I was paying for quality and a strong warranty. They chage over 10 bucks for 'shipping and handling' in order to replace each set under warranty, so its cheaper to buy a less expensive set initially and replace them when the time comes. The customer service was quick and relatively pleasant, but the wipers just aren't what they are cracked up to be!	-1
Installed on my 2012 Porsche 911 C4S.  Thought the squeek would go away but after 6 months of regular use still howling like mad.  However... Cleans well and is quite during heavy down pours and solid cleaning and endurance.	-1
cheap.....rust spots within months.	-1
Did not fit my 1996 Ford F-250 as advertised.	-1
I have been trying different brands of wiper blades - saw these on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  From initial use until I replaced them after 7 months I had a problem with severe shuddering/chattering in light rain.  I use Rain-x, so that probably is the cause.  The blades are relatively soft and looked like they would work well if the windshield had a uniform film of water (i.e. no Rain-x windshield water-repellant treatment).  For the record, the wipers that I ended up liking best on my (Rain-x-ed) cars are Bosch Excel+	-1
After about 8 months on my car, these wipers started to streak and chatter.  Contacted Silblade for warranty replacements, and they told me they would be shipping me free replacements under warranty within a week.  Three weeks later they still have not sent me the replacements and they are not answering my emails. The wipers worked great while they lasted, but you'll be lucky if they last a year.  The 5 year warranty seems like pure marketing hype to get you to spend a little more on wipers.  I could have gotten 8 months out of a pair of cheap Anco wipers for a lot less money.  I won't be buying these again.  UPDATE: I finally a received replacement blades, but only one of the replacements was the right size, and they were both a different "uni" style, made with a plastic frame that does not seem as durable as the metal ones that I originally bought.  This really is the last straw, ad I will not be a repeat customer!	-1
I put these blades on my car in late October.  We had a very mild winter with hardly any snow or ice.  By March, the blades started streaking my windshield.  Additionally, of the 6 blades that I ordered, 4 came without adapters & I had to call the company.  With apologies, the company shipped the adapters, but they should have been in the package.  This blade performed no better than any cheapo blade that I've purchased in the past.  I cannot recommend this item.	-1
Bought these wipers during winter last year. New England had a pretty bad winter, but I didn't get a lot of snow testing out of them. However, 6 months in they were already streaking. I have not tried contacting silblade yet but may very well have to as this winter looks like it will end up just the same. Having a jeep wrangler, there's not much out there for options with wiper blades. May just go back to get oem blades from a dealer again.	-1
It works fine, but the install instructions are not perfect. I clipped off the tabs it says to, but one of the tabs was actually needed. Its cheap, so I just bought a new one and will fit it myself.	-1
I purchased 2.  The left side worked OK.  The right did not fit as advertised.  I would not recommend	-1
I purchased these during the 2 for 1 deal because I had great success with them on my previous vehicle, a Mazda. Those worked fantastic from early 2008 until 2010 when I sold it. These latest units from Amazon came in an improved package. The frame seemed to be of slightly better quality than the older ones, however the ultimate issue was the blade. There was some sort of graphite goo ALL over the blade. I installed these on my brand new truck with a perfectly clean windshield and in anything but a complete downpour they made HORRIBLE screaching sounds, as well as leaving a smeared mess of that graphite goo throughout the wiper range.  I gave them a few days and nothing improved, and I had to keep breaking out my Meguiars 10:1 glass cleaner and clean the damn windows of that goo. I finally had it, removed them and wiped the blades with alcohol to remove the goo as thoroughly as possible. I figured at that point they would be just like the Silblades i had a few years ago. Nope, still noisy as heck! I tried to call the number for Silblade and continually got the voice mail for customer service. Finally a couple days later someone called me back but by that point I already sent these pieces of crap back to Amazon for a refund.	-1
This product was installed correctly and the blades still skip across the windshield. The only way I can turn the wipers on full blast is if its pouring. In a light drizzle get ready to hear alot of skipping and rubbing noises. I bought the valeo for my wifes truck and they work great. The only reason I went with the silblades is because my car has two different size blades and the valeo was out of stock. Next time I'll just wait!	-1
Nice fit on an 07 Tacoma, but the vibration is just way too distracting to make these worth the small increase in visibility.  There's a reason these are 1/3 the price of more custom fit mirrors and the plastic is just not thick enough to damp the vibration.  2 stars for price and ease of install, -3 for unusable amount of vibration.	-1
Well, you get what you pay for.  Cheap means cheap.  They look great...until you touch them.	-1
I could not fasten these tow mirrors tight enough to make them stop wobbling.  The wobbling made getting a quick review of what's behind you or what is in your blind spot difficult for me.  The wobbling images were troubling, especially at night when vision is hampered anyway.	-1
Does not provide much extra field of view, hard to adjust, doesn't strike me as being a very secure mount.  Previous towing mirror had an additional tether cord that wrapped around the mirror mount in case the main mount let go.  Don't think this one will last long, but purchased for the right side mirror.  Using the much better CIPA 11650 on the driver side&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CIPA-11650-Deluxe-Door-Mount-Towing-Mirror/dp/B00029WRJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CIPA 11650, Deluxe Door Mount Towing Mirror</a>, should have ponied up for one on each side.	-1
I purchased in December, installed 1/1/11 and returning this month to one of the best vendors ever on Amazon.... O'Donnell's Auto Parts.  Kevin helped me trouble shoot the issues at hand and my 1997 Toyota 4Runner.  Conclusion: The 4Runner's windshield is too flat and the silblades tension too tight to sweep water/debris without leaving a gap in the center of the blade. Just thought anyone with an older vehicle might want to know.	-1
Very cheaply made. Used for one trip. One of the mirrors' brackets broke off during a trip. They vibrate incessantly. Spend the extra money and get something better.	-1
The product is made of plastic.  When adjusting any vibration moves the mirror and it does not stay aligned properly.	-1
It's plastic	-1
It's a cheap mirror for a cheap price.  It's chromed plastic,  and probably won't last long.  I'm not even going to bother putting them on my car.  Luckily,  I'm only out $10	-1
Does not provide a clear view of cars and highway beside and behind us when pulling our travel trailer.	-1
These mirrors are built horribly, the only thing they would be good for would be temporary fix on a car you don't really car about looks.  I was going to use this just to be legal but they aren't worth the time.	-1
Thought I would give this a try. The price was cheap enough. But the product is still not worth the advantage. I installed it on a larger Ford F-150. The fit was decent. It does vibrate as other people here have noted. If it provided enough additional view...which is why you and I are buying it...the vibration wouldn't be detrimental. However, the benefit is minimal. I've uploaded a photo that kinda shows the additional view behind the trailer. It is 18ft long. So it's not very large. As you can see, the view is not improved very much. Here's my advice...save your money and spend it on some OEM extension mirrors made for your vehicle. Yeh, you'll spend a lot more. But the benefit will be a lot more.	-1
Might be a good product, but it is not universal as stated. Did not work on my 1975 Pontiac Grandville.	-1
Awful!! Extremely disappointed and I payed a lot for the shipping! Also, logic states that when you sell a mirror then the pair is going to come. NO! Just one! Terrible...	-1
Didn't attach well to my 04 Xterra mirrors.  Barely extended the view.	-1
Doesn't fit and too late to send back. Make sure you try out everything you buy right away. I don't tow my trailer everyday so it was over a month before I got to try it out.	-1
They somewhat work, but will get pushed around when driving at highway speeds, vibrate heavily when drivnig >20mph, the extension is too short to be really useful, but bottom line, for the money, it is better than nothing.	-1
OK - they aren't really very securely attached and do start to slide off over the course of the day's driving - they also VIBRATE so severely that you can only rely on them ONLY to let you know there is a shape next to you and nothing more - although at very slow speeds and backing up they are more visually usable.  The FALSE advertising of these is that 50% of the width of the clip-on mirror overlaps your existing mirror so you are only gaining 3" to 3 1/2" (three to three and one half inches) maximum additional view area on each side - for a TOTAL of 7" (seven inches) .... NOT seven inches on each side as is stated.  They are really worthless other than it is a law in Oregon to have mirror extensions when trailering so I am compliant even if they are technically useless.	-1
The small one piece air horn works as good as this for less and a smaller space. So I don't like this product since the same company makes a better one.	-1
This isn.t my first boat ride but its the last time il buy junk from this company. this thing broke just screwing it in. Should throw me another one and if it doesn't suck il change my feedback	-1
HAD IT ALL OF FIVE MINS. WHILE INSTALLING IT ON MY TRUCK THE CHEAP ADJUSTABLE CLIP BROKE. WHN I PICKED IT UP OFF DRIVE WAY PLASTIC TAB WAS SO THIN. ITS FRI. NIGHT OF PRES. DAY WEEKEND AND I HAV THREE DAYS OF HAULING MY TOYHAULER WITH NO ADD A MIRROR. DO NOT BUY. CAN NOT BELIEVE I WAITED A WEEK FOR IT TO GET HERE.	-1
I bought this for my 96 Jeep Cherokee so I could install a aftermarket radio, but it does not fit. Not even close. Never mind the CD pocket, the plastic "frame" itself is way too big to fit inside the opening where my stock radio was. A round of applause to Amazon for a easy refund after I brought this to their attention. I gave it 2 stars because it is very sturdy, it just doesn't fit my Jeep.	-1
I could not get this to properly fit in a 2002 Dodge Ram Van. The instructions made no sense, telling you to cut off the very tabs you would need to mount it. With a Pioneer deck mounted, it would not fit the dash opening unless you cut off the pocket. Very poor documentation.	-1
This item is bad very bad -big problem to separate layers of clue cover and the top plastic, I do think it is very old item.	-1
Terrible  stay away!!	-1
The PA system is very quiet, can barley hear it over a running engine. The only animal noise worth playing is the frog, the rest are very quiet. The sirens are alright, too quiet but alright. Extra speaker and power wire is needed in order to set up the system. You get what you pay for with this system that's for sure.	-1
junk. had to wait for months to get.  installed on boat. blew it couple times.  now it doesnt work.  wasted my money.  must have been a defective one sitting on shelf somewhere!!!!!!	-1
Husband bought them as add ons to what air horns he has on his dump truck. One was broken when we got it and the other was soo quite it was worth trying to attach it. So cheaply made it was sad.	-1
Terrible!!!!!!  This is like putting Elmer's Glue on the lettering. The crayon becomes soft and gooey	-1
I wanted to highlight the raised letters on my Tacoma truck tires. I bought this per the reviews listed. It applied well and appeared to be adequate. Howver, it washed off almost immediately after the first car wash. If it totally washed it would have been ok, but it only half diminished making it look very ugly until it entirely went away. There isn't much out there to paint the tires and have it stay.	-1
this pile of junk isn't even as loud as my stock horn,is not a good buy but it is big and shiny if that's what you want hard to mount with cheap hardware and you cant remove the big end bracket for relocation	-1
Way over priced for quality of construction and effects quality.  If I had a chance to test this first I don't think I would pay more than $10 for this.  Pretty chincy product.	-1
Hooked it up to my gsxr 750 hoping it would be louder than the stock horn, no such luck it sounded awful and wasn't half as loud as the stock horn. Not sure why i tried it with the bike running and not running, oh well im sure i can find anothee use for it.	-1
These were exactly what I was looking for to replace the factory horn in my Ford Pickup Truck. They were extremely loud and gave an excellent tone... I was extremely disappointed when I had to use my horn the other day and heard only the small trumpet sound, after professional troubleshooting it was determined that the large horn had shorted out after less than 6 months (about 4-5 uses). I'm also disappointed that there seems to be no warranty against defect, I expected them to carry at least one year. $70 bucks and 6months later I'm back in the same place I started - too much money for a product that has no support.	-1
Ok, good price, but Amazon's photo of item does not match what they ship... a bit dissapointed they did this.	-1
Oh, what an awesome racket this is - dishwasher detergent and colored mineral oil re-branded. Wow, what an idiot I was not to research these products before ordering! Folks, you can use Dawn dishwasher liquid soap to wash your K+N and regular mineral oil to re-oil the filters! That's it, bottom line. Of course, this looks fancy and professional, so go on and spend more than what it's worth, but there's no need, really. I personally washed my filter with an orange oil detergent solution and it cleaned right up. I used regular, clear mineral oil to oil up the filter and it works like a champ, but I had ordered this meanwhile, so I will put it to use in time. Researched the cleaning solution and the oil and found out cheaper alternatives.	-1
Was not louder than the horn I replaced but the tone was definitely more noticeable.  Unfortunately, the horn stopped working in less than two months.  Very disappointed.	-1
Does not stick, bad quality	-1
I bought one, it didn't work out of the box. Amazon replaced it, free of charge, and I got it two days later. It didn't work either.  I'm a mechanic by trade; I ride a 1990 Yamaha FZR600, one that I restored myself after finding it abandoned, sitting in the elements for 20 years (gauged by records of the last time the bike was registered, 1995). Not that it takes a mechanic to install a horn... My old horn works on the bike. My car horn works on the bike. When I plug the Wolo into the my leads, (one positive, one negative, as opposed to single-pole), nothing happens. You can hear and feel the horn struggling to function (it's just an electomagnet, nothing fancy) but it doesn't produce noise. When the leads were hooked up to my multimeter, they read 12v. So, I can't explain why the horns wouldn't work. It's not rocket science, in fact it couldn't be more simple. It's like a lightbulb; it's either on because it's receiving power, or it's off because it's not receiving power. I thought the first one was a lemon but two in a row in indicative of something. I wish I could attest to the noise they are *supposed* to make but I can't.	-1
cheap metal.  Stud stripped the threads and it became useless.  too late to return.  beware	-1
Probably my fault, but I bought this over a year ago and barely got around to installing this crazy thing now. The sirens and PA work, but the 50 music sounds and animal sounds don't. Bummer. It only has a 3 month warranty, but I'll call them anyway and see what they say (the box says if under warranty to send $10 for return shipping - steep for $40 item).	-1
Piece of junk. Wouldn't work right out of the box. DO NOT BUY FOR A HARLEY DAVIDSON. The spade lugs were built inside a plastic housing that wouldn't allow connection to the bike harness. Had to modify the plastic housing to connect. Once connected........nothing....just a piece of plastic with wires attached. I messed up by not making a test jig to test functionality...now I can't return this for a refund. I'll mark this one down as an idiot tax.	-1
If this is loud then I need a really big hearing aid don't waste your money and my hearing is very good	-1
Horn was good while it was working. Brought this in 2015. Lasted a little over two years and the horn is shot.  Hoped this item would last longer. I found out that the horn did not work in a situation when a car changed into my lane. I had no way to alert them. Almost got hit. Luckily the driver noticed me before hitting me. Hopefully no one else will have to be in this situation to find out the horn no longer works. Longer than stock horn but not crazy loud. Tested out the wires and horn button and I got good readings. Tested the horn on a 12v battery nothing.	-1
Installing was simple but the horn is not loud.	-1
Bought it in May 2017, but now (August-2017) it's starting to sound weak. Sounds like it's going to die already. Poor quality!!!	-1
Was loud and good, but died after 2 months. I would imagine it should still longer than June to August.  I've been looking to return, get a replacement or refund but since it was longer than 30 days there is no way to return	-1
It died as soon as it got wet.	-1
This horn has a great sound and volume. Considering the amount of sound it cranks out, I'd consider it compact as well.  Unfortunately, mine has stopped working less than two months after use. I can hear the diaphragm engage when I hit the switch but it fails to create any tone.  If it hadn't failed, this would've been a 4-5 star review. I will reach out to Amazon/Wolo and see if there's anything they're willing to do about it. I'll update my rating and review accordingly.	-1
does not fit right	-1
It sounds like a duck being choked, I should have left my stock one on, I would get sounding allot louder	-1
Sound and loudness not what I expected. Mounted on a KLR650 and there isn't really a good option. I ended up using the plate to anchor it on the top left corner of the radiator reservoir tank. i would not recommend it because the sound is barely sufficient and mounting options are very limited.	-1
Have purchased several through the last few years and never had a problem...until now. Bought in August to put on our RZR - Due to ynforeseen circumstances the RZR was broke down and this horn probly went on three rides - the last one after the repair was done and needed to use the horn and it doesn't work. Took off - bench tested and it toast. Came back here to see policies, side note - bought it at the end of august - no return available after October 8th... That's like a one month warranty - unacceptable.	-1
Shorted out after a few weeks. no good in my case.	-1
Installed, didn't, but did a nice job of blowing fuses.  Returned for refund; no problem with refund.	-1
Not as loud as I hoped for	-1
The Power Kleen cleaner in this kit isn't nearly as effective as I expected it to be, especially considering all the intimidating warnings on the can. I had to do a lot of hand washing under the sink with water and mineral spirits, as well as liberal use of the air compressor to actually get it clean. I suppose the cleaner might have worked eventually, but I didn't have 8 hours to sit around washing a filter.  The new oil (aerosol can) worked well and was easy to apply evenly, but the lid for it split in half on me after the can tipped over on concrete.	-1
Way too small to be useful. I am not sure that a bigger version would be better. The angle seems to be off.  I drive 100mi/D highway and find these useless.	-1
not good for dead spot.	-1
Not as pictured, also didn't work.  Should have tested it before fully installing it and already threw away the packaging.  Bought some Fiamm 'el grande' horns and they are working wonderfully.	-1
The horn failed after about 3 weeks. It was a particularly rainy 3 weeks. I suspect that it is not as water resistant as the OEM horn. The original low tone horn lasted 8 years, and the high tone is still going strong.	-1
Junk - product beeped twice and then dead.  Should have paid more attention to reviews.  Do not buy - you are throwing away $10 on this thing.	-1
So, it happened to me...DOA.	-1
I bought this horn and using it with the relay that Amazon recommends to buy with it, as well as the Will horn button and wiring harness kit. It sounds like a dying horse. With windows rolled up I can barely hear it inside my own jeep. Honestly only bought it because I need a "legally working" horn for cheap, so it serves its purpose. But be warned. Sounds like crap.	-1
it screwed up my motorcycle engine, letting dust and dirty oil enter the engine. have to pay extra $300 to fix my stuff	-1
This is just JUNK. Install on my truck, work excactly one day and one night. Second day it was dead. also my back up light NOT WORKING, ABS circuit is not working. I have to get down in the  the truck and take it out, check around wiring find out the Fuse link to all back up system is BLOW. That is half of the day trying to figure it out. Check the beep on the 12V battery. Nothing, tap on the body, beep a little bit then DEAD Very bad defective product and they claim made in USA. Shame, shame, shame Final: JUST DO NOT BUY THIS unless you want spend half of the day of headache and wasting times	-1
Junk. Broke - burned during installation. Smoke came out and smell. Do not buy.	-1
My fault for not considering the measurements but I was looking for a smaller version of the same product.  I drive a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and this Stick-On mirror took up way too much real estate on my mirror.  I ended up buying a smaller version from Lowes.	-1
Broke after two months use. Awful product.	-1
Weakest horn ive ever heard. Sounds like a mouse farted under your hood	-1
After installing this device and testing it's sound I ordered a different one from a different manufacturer. This one has a hig, raspy sound, not a good beep beep sound like you usually hear. I do not recommend this back up alarm.	-1
The compressor looked like it might have been returned before as the ink on the label was smudged, but otherwise looked okay.  It's true that this kit doesn't come with wiring on a momentary switch, but I didn't have an issue with that as it was a good excuse to get some quality 12 gauge wire and a decent low profile switch instead of that cheap one that comes recommended with this.  The compressor works okay for now (it's only been installed for one day) and I managed just fine with the short amount of tubing included, cut in equal lengths, but here's where this kit gets 2 stars.  The compressor hits notes at about twice the speed as it should and while you can definitely hear Dixieland, proving that the right tones are being triggered in the right sequence, it sounds like 2 of the horns are out of tune.  I'm going to try to tune the horns myself by shortening a couple then see what I can do about dropping the voltage to the compressor to slow it down a bit.  I'll probably end up breaking the cheap plastic horns in the process, but it's not like it really works right now anyway.	-1
This was a horrible purchase... I Installed everything and the sound was just way off. i even ordered another one thinking maybe they just mispackaged one og the horns..... nope... sent them both back and was pretty bummed about it. complete waste of time	-1
This is a cheap piece of junk and did not work when I installed it. I took it off and threw it in the garbage and bought another brand from the local parts store.	-1
I was using ovoid mirrors similar in size to the Hotspots mirror for years. When I could not locate a replacement of that style, I tried the Hotspots Convex Wedge mirror. For my purposes, it was a bad choice. It does not have the far angle viewing ability of competitive mirrors and it is extremely limited on the vertical field of view. Contrary to some beliefs, vertical view is important. For some people, it may be the right choice, for me, not so much. I give it a 2 rating because the glue has held to the mirror. I am now using the Camco Wedge, a considerably larger mirror for use on a pickup. The Hotspots mirror now has duty on the riding mower.	-1
when i shop my local store, what i saw is all of those mirror come with pair, however, this one only come with one, i think they gonna track people.and shipping take too long.	-1
The good: trumpet melody of The Godfather theme.  The bad:  you will need to supply your own switch, fuse, wire & mounting bracket.  The ugly:  if you don't lay it out & figure out everything first you may screw up. You have exactly the length of hose you will need without a millimeter to spare.  Since it was about 1/2 price on Amazon it was a decent purchase. But it is very time consuming to install.	-1
Sounds weak  I wish I could replace them and get better brand	-1
When i received this item i installed it with a 3A fuse worked fine, yet out of the nowhere it loses loudness or doesnt work at time.	-1
It worked well, not really that loud though. I put it on my jeep. The first time it got a little bit of water in it, it completely quit working. :-(	-1
It was awesome for the first few months. It sounded great and didn't seem too cheap. After about using it about 30 times over a period of 3 months the compressor broke. I haven't found a way to buy just the compressor so now everything I installed is worthless and just taking up space. This horn works great if you only want something to work for a one time use, but if you want something that will last I recommend trying to get a better quality horn.	-1
Starts in the middle of the whistle most of the time, so it has to be "pre staged" to work properly which sucks.	-1
tone quality off	-1
NOT VERY ADHESIVE. DIDN'T STICK TO MUCH OF ANYTHING THAT I WAS WORKING WITH	-1
My crazy neighbor has one of these installed on her minivan. It is seriously loud. Loud enough to hear a block away, which is a bit excessive for its intended purpose. My neighbor has a compulsion to move her car from the street to her driveway every night around midnight. It takes her several minutes to backup into the driveway. It is extremely annoying to keep hearing, "Attention, this car is backing up," over and over for a few minutes when I'm half asleep. I seriously want to damage this unit on her minivan and am considering hiring the local teenage thugs to do so.  So please, for the sake of the neighborhood, don't get this for your car. The whole block will hate you. It should have a volume control, and a simple beep-beep would probably be more effective than trying to figure out what the heck the sound is (sounds like a mechanized Southeast Asian female voice). With this and the Mister Softee Ice Cream truck jingle, it looks like a nightmarish summer ahead.	-1
More on the orange side than red. Could not use it as did not match up..	-1
This tape has a peel off backing which will intermittently not peel off correctly. When this happens the cut piece of tape is useless to put on a vehicle or what ever you are stripping. I thought by purchasing a higher priced tape that I would not have that problem. I was wrong with this tape	-1
I liked my wolo back up beeper better. Taking this off my truck so I don't look like an idiot.	-1
says "car" not "vehicle" and i put it on my TRUCK. product details are misleading. also, not very loud but definatley could be hear from outside another vehicle. easy to install	-1
After having a previous FIAMM dixie horn, I bought this one for the compressor alone to mix with the FIAMM trumpets.  It sounded great for the short few months it lasted, but the compressor broke roughly 5 months after I installed it.  I bought this horn a second time after having problems with my first one.  The second one I bought only lasted a total of maybe 2 days before the compressor seized up.  When I contacted the manufacturer, they told me that I would have to pay for shipping of the broken part to them and pay for shipping for the replacement part.  If I could give this less than one star I would. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT	-1
This item just did not work for us!  First, the directions for putting it together are printed very small and are quite difficult to follow.  Second, wonce on our tow vehicle, we spent a great deal of time arranging the mirror for towing.  Before we left the drive way, gravety pulled the mirror toward the ground.  Repeatedly, we would stop, tighten the screws/bolts, and within a mile we had a good view of the road.  Even after our trip, the hour I spent trying to tighten the mirror proved pointless.  Needless, to say, we towed out pop-up without extended mirrors.  Unfortunately, we cannot recommend this mirror for purchase.	-1
Necessary evil for up keep of K&N air filters.  What a pain.  My wife's car had a mass air sensor issue.  I cannot blame this on the K&N air filter, but I'm minimally re-oiling from now on.	-1
I used it for maybe 10 or 15 times and  air compressor is dead. I bought it while I was in US  and install it on my new VW Golf V (in Europe- I'm seaman ) , I spend few hours to install , and now I have to spend one more hour to dismantel it, and trow it in nearest garbage bin .	-1
Issue with CIPA 11750, Fender Mount Towing Mirror from Amazon... The description indicated it fits all car and trucks all except my ford full size PU a miners alteration will make it work RE: the lower arm is way to short to reach the wheel well By removing the lower arm hand screw and replace it with a -20 The tapped hole is metric, the  20 will be tight but it will work and lock its self to the upper turn buckle, adjust the turn buckle to best fit you truck or car, use a bungee to hold it in place, it works fine for me,,,	-1
I returned my KN filter to the store because even after I used the cleaning kit I still got poorer gas mileage than just a standard filter. Plus cleaning process takes a minimum of 30 minutes of your time and can make a mess if you are a renter and don't have outside hose!	-1
It appears the vinyl roll starts out much wider and is then bulk-cut into the 1.5' wide rolls.  I imagine the tool used to cut the roll is quite dull since the edge of the paper backing on the vinyl was frayed.  This resulted in tiny bits of paper sticking to the vinyl adhesive once the paper was removed.  These paper bits then show through the vinyl as tiny bumps/imperfections.  They are nearly impossible to remove and I wasted nearly half a roll and several hours trying to cover the chrome trim on a single car window before I realized what the problem was.  I returned the unused roll.  It might have been just a bad lot since most of the reviews are favorable, but I won't be taking a second chance.	-1
tears to easily	-1
After reading multiple reviews that were good - I purchased a roll of this stuff to black-out my fugly chrome trim on our Lexus. I cleaned the chrome surface with alcohol and let dry. I spent appx 3 hours cutting the tape to perfectly cover the chrome trim around the side windows. It looked great the first week - and I thought all was well, until it started pealing off. I went through a drive-through car wash once - hand washed the car for appx 2 months before removing it and paying a credible shop to install black vinyl profesionally. I should have spent the $150 and did it correctly in the first place.	-1
Gauge is fine but when I fitted the larger of 2 supplied T fitting to the transmission pipe the nut split before it was fully tight. T piece is cheap and nasty. I brought this kit as I needed all the fittings as I live in Dubai, and to source fittings can be a right pain. I now have a cut transmission pipe and no fitting to fit to it. Where can I get another? Not here in Dubai. Update. Amazon stepped up to the mark again and sent me a replacement complete gauge kit free of charge, now all plumbed in and works fine.	-1
i got  parts either someone sent back or were defective from new and even tho they leak and don't work I cant remove the T until I get something to put into the cooler line to stop the fluid from shooting out worse. B+M says Amazon doesn't sell their products even tho its where I bought it, they [B+M] also won't stand by their warranty, there was no sealer on the sending unit like the pic shows 9 wraps of Teflon doesn't seal it, the 1 side of the t is cross threaded and I sure cant do that with my finger tips	-1
The original would last for years, but the new tape that replaced it isn't as strong as an adhesive and doesn't stay on as well. Luckily I still have some of the old tape that I'll only use for the exterior of the car and only use the new version on the interior. Hopefully the makers of this tape will see this review and improve their tape once again!	-1
Tried applying this to a 2011 CTS-V and the results were not that great.  Yes, it can do smooth flat surfaces easily, but throw in a corner or unusual bend and it doesn't look right.  The product also rips easily when removing it from the backing and has very rough edges.  There really isn't a cheap way of blacking out trim.  I will be trying a plastic dip method next as that will evening and fully cover the trim.	-1
I've tried this product in the past and in my experience.....it's not worth it for two reasons  1)  It doesn't completely clean your filter.... (hold it up to the sun....that's the true test!)  2)  Unless your an expert painter....you will never get an even oil re-spray unto your "so-called" clean air filter.  It is quite simply impossible to get your air filter clean....that's why everybody throws them away.  Also, it is super critical that you spray oil evenly and it dries evenly for the best filtering and performance....but which are impossible to do with human eyes / application.  It's honestly better to buy a completely new K&N air filter......that's what I do for all my cars every 30 to 50K miles.	-1
Evidently, I did not read the dimensional specifications, as the unit is about the size of a Mounds bar. I wished to purchase a light for the rear of a truck, not a tiara for a Maserati. It is very stylish, but unsuited to the application. Also, one wire connection is confusing, as the vehicle has stop/turn wiring.	-1
Smaller than I expected. It's less than 5 inches long. But worse was it didn't work. Hooked up battery and nothing.  Returned it to Amazon.	-1
Product showed up empty.	-1
I just found out that the oil used in the k&n filters get on your MAS (mass air sensor) and screws up your engine Performance.  Wait till you see how much one of those gizmos costs.	-1
short and sweet, this item is no more powerful than stock headlights. I put them on and they put out less light than my bright headlights. Do not bother with this item unless you want to use it as an "alley light"	-1
pathetic sound.  not as loud as stock. I guess the comparison all depends on what you had previously.  All I had was stock on 2002 Suburban....these WOLOs didn't compare. I purchased locally at auto parts store and promptly returned them.	-1
Sound good but the horn is cheaply made. The plastic broke right at the install.	-1
These are in the garbage if you want them. Money wasted.	-1
junk.  died shortly after install.	-1
The oil remover, did not lady more than one use.	-1
Not deadly loud as I had imagined.  I have two similar Mazdas.  After installing in one car, I didn't notice much volume difference between the Wolo pair and the stock one horn.  If I have a decibel gauge maybe I can detect slight differences but just by ear...not much difference.  Didn't have any problem installing these.  But you do need some extra 16 or 18-gauge electrical wires to tap into the main line.  Other than that the package came with ground wires, extra brackets and nuts.  I didn't even read the instructions; it's self explanatory.  Only hard part was removing the plastic guards to get to the stock horn.  If I had to do it again would get a more powerful replacement...	-1
AFTER 2 MONTHS OF USE: I installed these on my 87 Toyota truck and they honestly worked for 2 days and then stopped working! I would tweak the screw and they would work but for only about 2 minuets! They drove me crazy! So I went to the junk yard and got a fiamm horn from an old suburban and they work and sound amazing! ( the suburban is about 6 years old so the horn is that old) Wolo horns suck go and get a set of FIAMM!	-1
I installed these horns on my new 2012 Kia Optima and I found very little difference. I recorded before and after video with sound. The amplitude is the same and the tone is just a shade lower in pitch. It certainly was NOT worth the cost and effort!	-1
does not fit	-1
I live in Georgia and on the first summer with the heat inside the car the glue couldn't hold the glass to the frame and fell.	-1
I initially rated this product very high.  Now I cannot recommend it.  9/10/13 update:  As you can see in my original review below, I like this mirror for what it does.  However, less than 2 months after mounting it on my Fiat Abarth, it fell apart recently when I went to adjust the mirror.  The bottom "L" brackets that adjust for mounting came adrift from the mirror and the whole thing fell on the floor.  Apparently the springs that hold the brackets in place - and in turn hold the mirror to the factory mirror - came loose from the brackets, and the brackets fell out.  From close examination it appears that the springs are put in place before the mirror is attached to the front of the unit.  So, there is no way to re-assemble the unit.  I gave CIPA a chance to replace the unit but they refused to do so - effectively taking them off my list of preferred sources.  Too bad.  What they should have done is shipped me a replacement no questions asked.  Being an engineer and a race car builder and driver, I of course re-engineered the unit with a few holes and some foam rubber on the back and wire-tied it to my factory mirror.  Of course the average consumer can't be expected to do likewise, so I am downgrading my review and can't in good conscience recommend this flawed product to anyone.  Original review:  A number of reviewers had problems with this mirror in that the adhesive that held the mirror itself in the housing melted in the heat, and dripped onto their dashboards.  Evidently CIPA got the message, as the unit I bought in July 2013 has not shown any signs of that happening - and I live is a hot part of California and my car sits out in the sun facing south - and with a winshield shade that concentrates heat between the shade and the windshield where the mirror sits.  So, that issue appears to have been solved.  Like others, I have found this mirror to be very helpful.  I am a careful (though "vigorous") driver, and I like to know what's going on around me.  This mirror is convex, but only slightly so, so it really does not distort your view to the rear that much.  In addition, beacuse the view from the mirror is that of looking through the car's windows, the body of the car provides perspective for judging how close and where other cars are.  Outside mirrors, by contrast, don't really provide that perspective.  In addition, because the mirror is relatively close to the driver, moving your head slightly allows you to change your view quite a lot.  I'm using this mirror on a 2013 Fiat Abarth, and because the mirror is well forward of the drop down sun visors, there is no interference.  Bu contrast, this would not be the case with my Acura MDX.  So you might want to consider that.  Mounting is a breeze as it just clips onto the existing mirror - which would cover up a back-up camera or other features that might be built into a factory mirror.  All in all, I find the product very well made, very useful, and at a reasonable price.	-1
5/29/2012, SF Bay Area:  The mirror portion finally fell-off today, after the glue holding it to the frame melted the rest of the way.  It melted quite a bit last summer, but did not fall-off and held tight through this past winter.  Lasted just about one year.  We got good use out of it during that time, but will look for a different vendor to replace it now.	-1
Fit and worked fine. I liked it pretty well.... Untill the first 80 deg day. When it got warm some thick clear sticky goop seeped out of the mirror and dropped on my console and carpet. Haven't got it all off yet. It's a mess, and the mirror came loose from the plastic housing on one end. Total junk.	-1
Thought I would give this a try to help with the blind spots I experience while driving my regular cab truck.....  It DID help, but even after using it for a week and a half, I still couldn't judge distance the way I needed to.....  There is a real learning curve to using this (as others have said...  I'm typically not a slow learner, but this mirror makes everything too small to call it useable....  I ended up hanging this in my office cubicle to see who is slinking up behind me (while I'm writing reviews on Amazon.. :-D)	-1
I've had this mirror since March 2011. I bought this to replace the one that had and broke. Although, it provides very good visibility and it serves the purpose in that regard, it has tow very major issues (at leat the one that I received has):  1- The mirror shakes and vibrates like crazy. Some times it vibrates so much that I have to take it off. At first I thought I might have installed the wrong way. I tried couples of different ways but it did shake and vibrate in all different positions. I also tried it on couple of different rental cars as well, same story.  2- I live in Florida so my car stay in sun for longer periods of time. In just 3 or 4 months since I got this, the glue that holds the actual mirror to the frame is started to melt and drip from bottom of the fram and it is meesing up my dash.  So, I will be throwing this piece of junk into the trash and off to getting a new one.	-1
This thing does give you headache and take a long time to get used to. I bought it because it is cheaper than the rest but the mirror somehow doesn't give accurate reflections due to the curvature, so not only the cars behind you look much smaller, it also sort of distort the view so it takes extra effort on your eyes to adjust every time you look at it. I am now searching for another one since it is too much hassle to return it. I wouldn't recommend this product.	-1
Don't waste your money.	-1
What should I do with this now????  I bought the K&N engine air filter for my 2013 MDX... mileage went from 17.5 to 15... ran 3 tanks through.  Went an got an OEM and it went back to 17.5.	-1
Covered my mass airflow sensor in oil , would never buy a K&N again.	-1
They make you think its just hook up qnd go and it is not. Even after i bought the relay and wires it didn't work. Save your money its junk.  Wish i could give 0 stars	-1
Sounds like a duck.  Get a Hutchinson.	-1
