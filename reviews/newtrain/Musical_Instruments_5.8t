I use them with an acoustic guitar and absolutely love them! They are easy to size adjust and have proven to be very durable. I will buy again.	1
Product as expected	1
love these picks	1
They're really sturdy and smoothly finished. A little mod for fit and I was enjoying them right away. With them adjusted to put the picking part close to my fingertip, they are more like playing with nails than the more traditional picks. You can get a little of the fingertip in on it if I want. I liked them so much I bought another set in case I lose one.	1
These finger picks work real well!	1
does not fit at all like the picture shows,the picture they provide shows the outer ring like a halo around the finger tip, so when you wear it it almost acts like a metal finger nail, if you look at the pic I provided you will see the loop is was to narrow and won't fit properly and I have small hands, you can adjust the band that goes around the finger to fit properly but not the loop. the seller only carries the one size, they offered to refund my $ if I sent them back, but since I would have to pay S&H i'd only get  maybe $4-5 back not worth the hassle . $8 wasted	-1
Good...I need to bend them to fit my fingers...I would've like 4 instead of 3 since I pick with my thumb too.	1
Good quality, does what it was made for	1
good picks, work well. not sure if they are my favorites yet.	1
As others have alluded, these are awesome if you are a fingerstyle guitar player and want to play banjo, which is my situation as well. The problem with many picks is they keep your fingers uncomfortably far from the strings if you're used to to keeping your fingers on or very close to the strings.  These also allow natural feeling down strums. I find them to be more comfortable than Alaska picks, which I also like but they don't feel as secure. I paired these finger picks with a Fred Kelly thumb pick, and just like that, I don't suck as much at banjo.  Highly recommended, the price is fine for specialty picks, and shipping took about a full week to San Diego CA, was expecting much worse.	1
A little hard to get used to if like me you are just starting to finger pick after playing for 50 years without these finger nail "savers" and cool sound they make.	1
Of all the fingerpick's I've tried to date -- plastic; nylon; metal; etc. -- these are the best.  Really, I think the only reason I didn't give them five stars is that I just have never liked -any- fingerpicks that much; I've always found them uncomfortable and difficult or impossible to properly adjust.  Sometimes, though, you've gotta have them -- for example, when playing bluegrass banjo, or lap-steel with cable-gauge strings.  This design leaves most of the fingerpad area open so it's possible to fit the picks such that you can actually still /feel/ the strings with your picking hand.  This may or may not actually improve control, but it /feels/ like it improves control, so if nothing else that perception improved my attitude.  Moreover, the thin picking band fits right up under the edge of your nail, so that you are contacting the string much closer to where you would be if you were playing /without/ picks, which again contributes to a more natural feel.  Another thing that's always bugged me about conventional finger picks is that unless you cinch them tight enough to cut off circulation in your fingertips, they always feel like they are about to fall (or fly!) off -- and sometimes they do.  Not so with these picks; when I finally got them adjusted to my satisfaction I found them much more comfortable than conventional fingerpicks, and they felt -way- more secure on my fingers.  I haven't had one come off while playing yet.  One minor caution:  These picks are made of /very/ hard stainless steel, and I expect them to last a long time; but because the metal is so hard and so thick, it does take a bit of time with a set of smooth-jawed pliers to get these picks properly adjusted.  Once you do though, I think you'll like them.  Recommended.	1
I started learning banjo after 30 years of playing guitar without finger picks. I was having such a hard time playing with traditional metal finger picks because I could not get used to the lack of feeling. BUT I really wanted that twangy bluegrass sound that metal picks give you.  These picks are PERFECT for a person in my situation. I'm so happy I found these picks. Very fast shipping too!	1
I'm used to conventional steel finger picks. These actually work really well as long as you don't play hard, like I sometimes do with my other picks. Playing hard really hurts my exposed finger pads that are ordinarily covered by regular picks. However, these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly.	1
i tried using these for bluegrass style, and even when i tried to bend it to work for me they seemed to cut off my circulation almost... not too big of a deal, i mainly fingerpluck anyways. just figured i'd see how they work. HOWEVER they are great for frailing believe it or not. i'm not the banjo player with a huge coke nail to do clawhammer with, i have to use a finger pick. these work extremely well as a "false nail", they are unobtrusive and comfortable	1
These are great. If you finger pick give them a try. I think you'll like them. Supplement your other picks	1
Although Im not into guitar picking style, I wanted to try this feel, and seemed natural, when I realized how to put them...  much better than plastic ones	1
I kept giving up on finger-picks until I tried these. Amazingly, now I can get the sound of the pick without loosing dexterity. It will probably take me awhile to get the same degree of dexterity as with bare fingers, but being able to feel the string makes all the difference. The difference between these and regular finger-picks is like night and day. (Because they came from the UK, it took an extra week or so, no big deal.)	1
I love the open feel from these picks.  It's almost like picking with with just your fingers, except with more volume.	1
Bought these as normal finger picks were not working for me.  I grew up playing without picks when playing finger-style and the transition to wearing picks was not going well. I can wear these either on the outside or inside of the nail. These are working a lot better for me.	1
Most comfortable picks - only complaint is that I would like four in a pack. If you use all four fingers buy two sets...	1
I work so nails get broken fingers get cut but for a hobby I like to finger pick the guitar. For a few buck I play no mater the condition of my fingers.	1
These are high quality and easy good fitting.  Nice bright tone, I'd like to find these in Brass to tryout.	1
Even though I've been playing the Banjo for only about two years, I would try different picks to see if they are better for my picking action. Maybe I'm to dumb to know how to use them, but I could NOT adjust to them at all. Sorry!!	-1
Sounds like a great concept and they seem well made. I just don't care for them. I know others love them so I guess it's just a personal thing. It took weeks to receive them in the US. Don't be in a rush.	1
These are excellent quality finger picks. Just like the ones from 40 years ago! They are made from stainless steel and are adjustable by bending the finger collar slightly open or closed. They were shipped quickly and arrived safely before the suggested delivery date. Very pleased as these are hard to find here in the US.	1
These finger picks are the most playable I've ever used. You can't compare the feel to anything else I've tried. Being able to touch the strings allows for that bare-fingered tactile sensation while striking a bright, clear tone. I've adjusted them to angle slightly toward the thumb side of each finger pad to correct the striking angle for my hand placement. When I file my thumb pick nice & short my Travis picking improved about 2 levels instantly compared to bare-fingered comfort with the best pick struck sound I've enjoyed yet.	1
I decided to try these open metal finger picks when I could no longer find ProPicks, which I really like.  ProPick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar.  Compared with the ProPicks these are manufacturer from a heavier, stiffer metal.  They offer the user the advantage over conventional plastic and metal finger picks that you can actually feel the string with the fleshy part of your finger.  I find these (and the ProPicks, for that matter) much more natural than conventional picks.  These actually have some advantages over the old ProPicks: (1) you get three finger picks, rather than two; and (2) because the metal is a heavy gauge, they seem to be less likely to bend during playing and fall off your fingers.  It would be nice to see these packaged in a little plastic container so that they're protected in the guitar case; however, they are so heavy duty that they can probably survive quite well free-ranging around in the case.  Highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar.	1
I don't know how Tone Deaf Music made a profit on these finger picks by not charging a shipping fee to the U.S. They have my appreciation, though.  I found that the stainless steel picks required a pair of needle-nose pliers to properly adjust, but once they're adjusted, they stay that way--unless they are unnecessarily abused. I found that they also work for me much better than solid tipped steel finger picks. I also found that they take very little time to learn to use, and that's saying a lot for someone who has never had any previous interest in using finger picks.  I just wish that these picks were distributed in the U.S. I received my set of picks in excellent condition, but U.S. Customs held up the delivery by more than a week. That is to say, they shipped almost immediately, but it took a week longer than the estimated delivery date to arrive at my home. I blame the delay on U.S. Customs, since the picks are steel and probably set off alarms when they went through the Customs scanner. Oh well, Customs was just doing its job.	1
Easy to adjust, no pinching, no slipping off strings, ability to have a softer sound without taking them off and finally, no reason to keep my fingernails long.  I have other finger picks (plastic and steel) but these are the best.  I wish there were 4 instead of 3 as I can use this on my thumb quite well.	1
I love these picks. Being able to feel my fingers on the strings is important to me, and to still have a hard metal pick end is awesome.  I recommend these.  The seller was great in communicating with me.  They were shipped from a long way away but got here quickly.  Thanks so much.	1
Dunlops are all that I have previously used, thumb and fingers. I still use the Dunlop thumb pick, but these finger picks, from Tone Deaf present themselves as a much smaller, focused striking surface that allow me greater control when playing the guitar, banjo or dulcimer. I just received the picks and don't yet know about longevity, but as long as Tone Deaf provides these picks, they will have me as a customer.	1
I like to play with no picks but just don't get enough sound to be heard. These picks give me the best of both worlds and the price was great as well. Great customer service from this vendor too.	1
I play with fingernails and just can't control standard metal banjo-style fingerpicks because I can't feel the strings. I used Alaska picks for years, which are very good. These are better. They give the control of nails, yet the tone and protection of metal - and I can feel the strings! Muting, harmonics, everything...  If you play with nails and want finger picks, these are for you.	1
I bought these mics with the refund I got from Amazon after I complained that they hadn't followed my delivery instructions for my Fender Acoustasonic 40 amplifier, reviewed elsewhere. I needed some better gig mics than the ones I had, and chose these for a couple of reasons. First, I'm a total amateur, so there was no need for me to spring for something like Shure mics, good as they are. Second, for a set of three, the cost per mic was significantly less than the cost for the most similar Behringer mic sold singly. Third, Samson's mics were not reviewed as well, besides which I had one of that make that I bought as a remainder on Amazon and am not entirely happy with it. Fourth, the description for these said they have a built-in windscreen, and my Samson mic does have a tendency to pop when it's turned up very hot. Fifth, they have an on/off switch, which is useful in a performance setting. Having received the mics (also delivered improperly by Amazon!) I have had a chance to practice with them, and I am quite happy with them. The built-in windscreens aren't as effective as the foam ones, but they aren't bad. They work well with my amp. I'm not experienced enough to talk much about the technical specs and performance, but I anticipate that they will meet my needs very well.	1
great mike. great sounding. sleek and nice.	1
So, I decided to take a risk after being very displeased with the Xm8500 option. (Not only were they muffled but no on/off switch also?? No bueno.)  But - these are great microphones for the price! The sound is quite clear and does not seem to pick up background noise. These are being used for our church music (vocals). Very pleased with this purchase!	1
These microphones work very well in Behringer, and older Peavey PA heads. I think they sound better, and are easier to mix, than sm 58s in these pa heads. I always want an on/off switch on the microphones, these have it. And a nice case, and 3 microphone clips...  Real good microphones for the money.	1
good product	1
Bought these to add to the six I already have. Very good Mic and love the case.	1
Excellent set of everyday-use mics for live performance. Nice case too	1
Great value.  Already had this set, for a few years, still going strong.  Needed more mics so I got another set.  I paid more for the stands and cables than for the mics!	1
Nice for the price, not much gain compared to a shure mic. a little "bassy", but nice sound anyways	1
Used them at church. Nice sound. Comparable to Shure SM58's.	1
Absolutely amazing mics i have put these through the mill . I have used them for years at concerts for vocals and instruments. No problems and they sound amazing for the price compare to shure sm48 or sm58 . I have smashed them on floor on stages banged them around . They feel heavy duty metal conetruction . Highly reccomend.	1
fantastic sound picks up voice clear&loud	1
nice!	1
Great mics for the price.	1
For years I bought an equal set, the case was better and the sound quality of the microphones was much better.	-1
FYI, you will need to talk/sing directly (center) to the microphone. For someone this could be an inconvenience, but for us it is really good, because this means it won't caught a lot of background noise.	1
We use two sets of these for our weekly round-table in-person podcast, and they work very well for the most part. The carry case is handy, but be warned, the included mic clips are shoddy and break too easily. Just in casual use three of the six clips snapped within two days of opening them.  The mics sound pretty decent, but you gotta be right up on them to really get a clear sound.	1
These were recommended to me by a musician friend. I have other mics that were far more expensive and I am amazed how nice these work. If you want something that doesn't break the bank here it is.	1
These work just fine, thank you.	1
Great product and seller	1
I did not buy them here bought them from sweet water. I been a sound engineer for over 13 yrs for the money you cant beat them they are on par with the cheaper shure mics. they are very clear distortion free great lead vocal mic and of course background singers also good for micin up a acoustic guitar . All in all well worth 40 bucks for 3 extra mics that sounds pretty darn good for what they are.	1
We used them as instrument mics for cabinets. Not bad at all after a minor EQ adjustment at the mixing console.	1
SO GOOD!!!!	1
You get what you pay for.  I got these for when I do sound for hardcore bands and karaoke. They are inexpensive and basically do their job.  If you're a pro, get the Shure SM58 or better.  These are durable and work well,  but run a little soft and muddy	1
These mics are GREAT for the price. My bands uses these for the secondary vocals They sound just as clear and crisp as the SM58 that our lead singer uses	1
The case and the mic clips make this purchase worth the money in my opinion.  I've tested all these mics for sound quality differences, and they all sounded exactly alike.  I have yet to test them on drums.  You have to be careful not to burmp your mic stand or to handle them roughly, as they are very sensitive compared to a 57/58.	1
Mega bang for the buck	1
First off I was not sure if these mics would perform well but they do the job and they are directional so you have to put it in front of your mouth, but that helps to block out all the unwanted yelling and screaming from the audience so you are heard over the PA !!! Great  mics.	1
Exactly as advertised	1
Great for the price!	1
I purchased these mics from another site but wanted to share my experience with them. These are decent mics for micing drums no queastion. For vocals they can be so so depending on the singers voice. Overall great buy.	1
Surprisingly excellent mikes - for the price I was expecting much less.	1
I love these Behringer Ultravoice Wm 1800 mics, the produce great voice recall & work reliably for me at my gigs.	1
So far they have worked great for the first two rounds of pod casting. The sound is clear and the on/off is handy since I don't have any stands with them yet and setting them down live is a heck of a spike. For the price hard to beat but then again I am a real noob in the sound department so what do I know.	1
I have had these for a long time now and still going strong. Great mic for the money!	1
Excellent back up mic's	1
Pretty good microphones for a really low price. Can't complain.	1
Second set they work well.  Carry a little more high than the xm8500	1
Money's worth. Good sound quality.	1
Quality microphone for a great price. Bought 2.	1
A good buy	1
for the dollar I think there great, I use these when we run shot and need extra mics at church, I can have them side by side and can not hear a sound quality difference the back shielding (for controlling feed back is good),  yes there plastic body instead of metal and there lighter weight, and I am sure there insides are less than one that retails over  $100+ ,  but they are so far a great value for us,  this is actually my second set of them I have ordered,	1
Really outstanding value. Love these mics.	1
Great	1
Nice Microphone. Works great and priced right!	1
works fine	1
VERY GOOD	1
I have bought two sets of these microphones. These are our go to for vocal and mic'ing up our amps. I can't believe how good they are for being so inexpensive. They sound clear and do not have an "auctioneer" sound to them like some cheap mics do. And if you drop one like we have, you can unscrew the mic screen and push it back to normal and they still work just fine.	1
Hubby's musician friend thinks it's great!	1
Great product and it was delivered in a timely manner. I have had no issues and i appreciate the smooth transaction. Thanks... I truly appreciate it.	1
Great sound. I love this mike. Will buy again and reccomend to my friends.	1
Good mic for a garage band.  Cheap enough that you can use in a situation where you may not want a really expensive mic, yet quality is still important.  It is certainly not as good as my Sure mic's, but I also paid 1/10 the price.  The quality is fine.  We have even used for recording.  Best part, at this price, if it gets wet (we perform outside more often than inside) or it gets dropped loading/unloading, nobody is going to get upset. There is something about having equipment that is good but expendable.	1
These are decent stage microphones. I have two sets now. Definitely not an Sure SM58 but will get the job done with a decent engineer. Probably will keep a few sets on hand for any situation. Thanks.	1
Wow!  Great value!!!  Behringer has been wonderful!	1
Good price nice microphone	1
I bought these to use as house mics for shows where I don't want to give the bands my "good" mics.  The good: - The carrying case is great...for my Shure mics! The Behringer mics travel loose in a bag while I keep the Shure mics safe. - The cost, obviously. I'd buy another set of these just to get the case that they come in! - The on/off switch is good for doing tremolo effects on your voice - No big deal if you lose them, since they're cheaper than the beer at the bar  The bad: - The grille is flimsy. I dropped one mic, and ended up with a huge dent. - These clip/distort fairly easily, even with the mixer gain turned down. You can have a 0dB level on your mixer channel, and still hear distortion if the singer is powerful enough.  Overall, I'd buy again if I needed another carrying case for my better mics.	-1
Very good quality. Definitely an upgrade for me from my last microphone. Crisp and clear!!	1
Excellent	1
Nice mic for drunks in bar karaokes,it'll take a lot of abuse and still sound good.	1
Get what you pay for.  Heavy construction so added start for that, but you really need to power the feed... high volume and high gain to get output.  I'm a noob at this stuff, so that's probably a "thing" I've not learned yet.	1
I use a ton of these microphones in my karaoke DJ business. They are affordable, and produce excellent sound for a budget microphone. Only thing preventing a 5 star rating are 2 design flaws. The wiring attached to the condenser often breaks, and sometimes the xlr port on the bottom cracks with repeated use. Solder and super glue have fixed both problems for me. Otherwise, these can't be beat for value and sound reproduction for the cost.	1
Surprisingly good for the price! Comparable with much more expensive mics.	1
Have used them for Karaoke and they have great volume and serve the purpose for which they were purchased.	1
sounds good	1
I bought a set of 3 of these a while ago and am very impressed of their sound quality and durability! I use these for practicing guitar/singing in preparation of church praise band events. Also use them for Karaoke with friends. Great value for the money!	1
Great	1
I have nine of these in my music studio and people that come and perform here say they sound just like a Sure mic..  They have great tone, and I can get the volume I want without turning the gain up very high on the mixer.  I use them for mic'ing my guitar amps as well, great tone...Great value and good quality ...	1
What a buy !  These work as good as a mic costing many times It's price.  Use them in all kinds of settings and they do what they should do.	1
excellent for public speaking	1
GOOD PRODUCT	1
Very good quality. I love them.	1
Great for the price	1
Did some A/B testing against some higher end mikes. Then used them for vocals in a live setting. Worked great.	1
Real nice mics ,  use them at  a small  venue works well. Great price	1
very good.	1
Great price! These work great for a podcast.	1
Good mics.  If you are purchasing wired equipment I would recommend these for the money.	1
For the price point you cannot go wrong with these mics. They pick up your voice with ease, and have very full sound without picking up too much 'extra' noise in the background.	1
These sound great for the money. You gotta eat 'em, but they work well even for recording a podcast.	1
Thanks	1
Was quite impressed  Not expecting the wonderful protective padded hardcase and and Mic stand holders.	1
very good	1
Great item, I really like it	1
work like a charm	1
These are nice microphones that work well as back up microphones (or those times when an extra person shows up for a gig, or when you unexpectedly need to mic a drum). They come in a very nice foam lined case which is easy to carry and pack (and can carted around in a box of spares without getting damaged). These are probably a bad choice for serious/professional singers (go out and buy yourself a top shelf microphone if you want to sing with a band!), but are nice to have around and have surprisingly nice sound.	1
We bought these microphones hoping that we found a decent microphone for the price, in fact we bought two (3) packs. As far as vocals it has no range and is very, very quiet compared to other microphones. As far as construction they are cheap in quality. Frail wiring and horrible internal parts, and really light body. Not happy at all, If you don't care about how your voice sounds, or your trying to embarrass someone, or your using it for a prop, go ahead and buy it, but if you are a performer that cares about how your voice is heard, I would run away from this bargain!!! I don't even think they are worth trying to resell.	-1
Excellent value and performance. Hard to beat them for the money.	1
great	1
It is good for the price. Delivered on time.	1
Reliability and great sound .	1
No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described.	1
Great...	1
just an awesome mic set.. sounds great, and a really decent price. I would buy again and recommend to friends.	1
Love the clear sound	1
Bought these for use on a podcast. They aren't the best mics ever but they do a pretty good job once you clean up the audio a bit. I would recommend, for the price I would say it's worth it.	1
Been doing dj and karaoke cant afford expensive mics to be dropped by non pros this behringer mic set is perfect sounds are clear. Even in the band the lead singer really likes these mics.	1
Using for home studio as backups, work perfectly for cheaper mics. Sound great!	1
Excellent mics.  I am currently using these for a small tour.  The case is decently sturdy, the foam is well packed to the microphones and holders, and the mics themselves have a very sturdy, robust build.  I was skeptical to purchase, but I actually constantly run 9 of the mics.  I have not had many issues with feedback, but they give a great signal send to the board.  Does not require phantom power (for those who are unknowing.)  I actually purchased these (one, for the price) and sold off my Shure SM58s.  I would say they work better for vocals than instruments, and do have a full bottom end to them.  Totally go for this if you are hesitant.  I actually labeled the mics (with nail polish, don't dog on me dude), to be able to tell which mics go into which case (just small dots).	1
Really decent mics for the price.	1
nice mikes, nice price	1
love them	1
We bought these for podcasting and were not disappointed. Out sound quality went up quite a bit without spending very much money. We may upgrade again in the future, but for now, combined with a cheap windscreen, these are great.	1
Bought this set based on reviews and my experience with Behringer products. Behringer takes a lot of heat for using "cheap" material, etc. I do not find that to be true. I have Behringer pedals, an Acoustic ACX 900 amp that I really like. The mic set is perfect for my application. Through a PA, Amp or powered speaker, they sound very nice. The on/off switch is a nice feature and I don't get a "pop" when it is switched on or off. If you play local gigs in small venues this will work well for you. If you are touring or on the road every week you may want something better. These sound as good as a Shure58 at a fraction of the cost.	1
Best bang for your buck out there for mics. I only use them for practice at my house, but I must admit I was shocked at how well they work. Took a gamble on this purchase and it paid off big time! Just try not to drop them cause the top part will dent easily but definitely not a dealbreaker there considering the price and how well they work.	1
They are not the best mics ever but they sure do the trick for Karaoke microphones, I had to adjust the levels with each microphone to make them sound the best but once I set the Mics they are awesome for my Karaoke Shows	1
Pretty good quality. Use them for band gigs and have not had any problems with feedback, distortion, or any other interference or noise.  Comes in a nice hardcase for transport.	1
Top quality at bargain prices.	1
great sounding little mics especially for the price.	1
Perfect	1
I received the item as describe, very good mic for vocal song with set very cheap compare to expensive name brand but the same quality or even better ouput.	1
Decent for price range.	1
5 star rating takes into account price. I don't know what is up with these, but for the price, it can't be beat. I have a good quality mike I use for recording and performing, but, a new band is going to be practicing at my place. I had a Behringer 12 channel mixer and a couple of 750w mackie powered cabs for my TV/Gaming system in the living room. I needed some mics just so we could practice here. If the band takes off, they will have to supply their own mic, so I didn't want to invest in quality mics for everyone. I was going to pick up some "cheap" Shure PG-58s and came across these, three for a bit over half what it would have cost for a single Shure mic. For the price, it was worth a risk to try them. Three mikes for less than a tank of gas? I have not stressed them, but they sound just fine. I can only guess there must be a dramatic difference in the audio response, but I can't tell and this is a "garage" setup. I doubt we would use them for a gig anyway, but I have not tested them in a sound mix yet.  Behringer is probably cheap stuff, but everything I've had from them, has lasted a very long time. Others seem to state a different view, so maybe it's just if you get a good unit, you are lucky. But I've had no problems and these appear to be yet another product like that from this manufacturer.	1
Ok, I KJ and have my fair share of butterfinger-singers. These mikes are a prayer answered! They're not Shure Beta58's but they sound great and are as sturdy a mic as I've ever owned. My weekend Lounge-Lizard's love 'em! Thanks Behringer for producing a mic that makes my customers sound good and can take a drop kick at the end of the song! Also, you get a padded carry case and mic clips. What more could you possibly want? $39.00??? I'M BUYING MORE!!!	1
very good sound	1
great sound and low back ground pick up.	1
Best price compared to quality. * * * * * 5 STARS	1
In my opinion, these mics sound better than what most of the reviewers say.  I am happy with them.	1
Great. Actually preferred the sound i got out of these little guys over my Shure SM58... Dont know why. I just did. So i ordered 2 more!! Because when you break them you don't have to cry about it. :D (just fyi... i know saying i prefer them over Shure sounds crazy but that is MY opinion... and i am a professional musician and engineer.)	1
worth the money	1
For the money, really good!  I use them for instruments and vocals.	1
I tossed the pics and am using the case for some better microphones. I'll never buy Behringer again. I expected a low quality product for this price, but what I got was a product unworthy of the title "microphone". It clips at the lowest of volumes. The range is so limited, our singers sound like garbage. I've had better mics from cheap Karaoke kits that performed better than these. Stay away.	-1
I purchased these about a week ago, thee shipping was fast and well packaged. Ill say for the money these can't be beat, I tested them right away they all work great, nice clear sound, no hiss or hum, and I like the plastic storage box, keeps them safe and clean, unit comes with (3) mic holder clips, not the best quality, but I sure don't have a problem with them, I recommend these mics, for home studio use they work very well.	1
very good product	1
These sound really good and seem to be holding up to 2-4x weekly use	1
I bought these because of the price, and was pleasantly surprised by the sound of these microphones. They are well worth more than I paid for them ,and works well as backup mics. I won't use them for front line vocals because I think that will be asking too much of them because they are a bit on the bright side, but in small non professional environments this will do just fine. Plus they are very durable indeed .And the carry case gives that extra touch. My four star rating comes because they are not top of the line mics ,but in some instances you won't know, Its just our secret.	1
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE...THANKS !!!.....DR M RAJ SINGH	1
Awesome sound reproduction. Just as good as the SM58. Solid build. Good quality mics.	1
This is the perfect karaoke mic kit. Customers always comment on the quality of sound. I have to agree seeing I've been a DJ for over 30yrs.	1
very good	1
it exceeds my expectations. vocals are super clear and live	1
great mics! Great quality and value.	1
Great Item!  Super Fast delivery and Perfect shape!!!!!!!!!!! AAAA+	1
Guess I didn't read the description very well as I was only expecting 1 and not 3 microphones for this price.  I am using the mic along with a cheap foam wind screen on my Flex-5000A transceiver.  It drives the Flex just slightly harder than the Heil PR781 that went over to the Flex 6300 Signature radio.  Reports on 80 and 40 meter ESSB are good with no significant adjustments required of the 10 band graphic equalizer.  Maybe these don't survive drops or other abuse as $500 microphones.  I sure don't understand the hatred some musicians have for Behringer products.  They work well for me!	1
In my work as musician ever take the best case to sing. The Behringer XM 1800S gives the response for a good performance.	1
Wow, not going to lie, these microphones are great for the price. I'm not enough of an audiophile to really compare them to other dynamic microphones, but they've worked for me and the band I'm in flawlessly. The carrying case is great, too.  Highly recommended.	1
Received the microphones on time, and packaged well.  The case was a bonus, as is the microphone clips for stand mount.  I purchased these units as a gift for my grandkids Christmas to use with a powered speaker/amplifier system.  I tested them using both a Lo Z XLR cable and a XLR to 1/4 inch plug and worked fine.  Sensitivity was better with the Lo Z XLR to XLR cable, but for my grandkids this is no issue.  Mic element is sensitive to handling as compared to the SM48 and SM58 but what do you expect for this great price.  For the price, this deal is hard to beat.	1
The price is right, the build is solid, all black creates a nice profile. The case is convenient. Nice bonus to get the mic clip holders.	1
For the price these work great for small gigs or karaoke.	1
We go thru pikes at our school like Grant taking Richmond, so this multi-pack is ideal to always be with a mike in house.	1
Well built and great price. I[m giving 4 stars because the sound quality is ok. then again, that's is what I paid for..	1
I own 3 sets of these mics and none have disappointed . I use them for a live weekly radio broadcast and they have performed great .	1
Great product. Arrived when expected and functions as expected.	1
excellent, I received perfect	1
EXCELLENT , 100 % RECOMMENDED	1
Good quality for the price	1
good	1
No distortion; love these mikes for the price!	1
great items.	1
Totally worth it, it is a value pack, the mics don't feel cheap and actually delivers good quality sound, i use it for voice only	1
As many of written, these are the Amazon podcasting steal. For $40, this is a very good value.  Pros: ** Price vs performance... pretty good. ** Has more output than my SM57s. ** 600ohm resistance, so you get a little more dynamic range than normal.  Cons: ** For podcasting, you may still need a little preamp boost like a Fethead. ** Again, for podcasting it is a good idea to get some foam ball pop filters. ** The mic clips are marginal. The threaded brass inserts strip out of the plastic.  Overall a good value. At 64kb, compressed into MP3, you aren't going to hear a huge difference in audio quality between these and something much better. It will come down to your mic speaking technique.	1
A little tinny bit for the money they work	1
i'd buy again	1
very good	1
They're not high end, but they are great spare mikes for the price. Nice frequency range AND and on/off switch!!  Professional looking carrying case w/ clamps is a bonus.	1
I've used a lot of different mics over the years and I would not hesitate to use these on stage for a small venue.  I bought the three pack to keep around as beaters and I am amazed at how well they perform!	1
Can't beat the price, if your looking for some nice inexpensive mic's go ahead and get these. They work fine seem to sound good, the case is solid too. Can't say for sure how they compare to a high end mic but they sound good to me. Their solid and you get 3 with a case... No brainier, yeah go for it!	1
I love my item, it came when expected as described. I was very happy with the quality and would refer friends and reorder myself!	1
Okay mics for a youth band.  There is a lot of hand and cable movement noise if they are being handheld.  On the stand they are okay.	1
i have compared this mike with shure 59a betta with my pro stereo headsets and found no difference at all.	1
Microphones sound great for the price. Really impressed.	1
There good mics	1
These are beautiful microphones. I bought the pack for podcasting and I'm glad i did, they have a huge range to pick up sound from fairly far away and are very clear. I wish behringer offered a condenser mic pack as well.	1
Great bargain price. 3 great vocal microphones, in its own protective case, with its own holders. Not top end ... but for general purpose use and abuse ... works just fine. Sensitivity and clarity is more than acceptable for my needs. Feels quite solid.	1
Cant beat this packaged deal for the price. They sound great and will do perfectly for singing and karaoke. Thanks	1
The sound is okay, not great, but not bad either, and I like mics with on-off power switches for our group.  These are great backup mics to have on hand in case any of our better mics fail.  Very good value product.	1
My introduction to the Ultravoice XM1800S came last year, as it was the microphone included with the Europort EPA150 that I ordered. Among the things I was impressed with initially about it is, not long after I took it out of its packaging, I accidentally dropped it onto a tiled floor. Though a very small dent appeared (which was easily fixed), it did not affect this microphone's ability to perform, demonstrating that while it is light, it is also rugged.  A few weeks later, I took this microphone along with my Shure PG48 to a performance where I gave the singer the option of which microphone he wanted to use (I was running sound for him that night). Initially he went with the Shure, but after warming up he tried the XM1800S and ended up using that one for his performance. While the PG48 is a fine microphone in its own right, there really was no comparison as the Behringer was just better. I have seen elsewhere that the Behringer XM1800S is very comparable to the more well-known Shure SM58, and I would say that is accurate.  It became then an obvious purchase when my church needed new microphones. The mics they had been using, the Samson R21, are not terrible when given the proper application. I found they work better in amplifying the acoustic instruments than as vocal mics, so we have kept them around for that purpose. Vocally however, the choice was clear that the Behringer is, simply put, superior. I bought the 3 pack of microphones, and tried them out. As expected, they worked brilliantly.  Simply put, Behringer makes professional quality sound equipment, and you're not going to pay professional sound equipment prices. I have ordered 2 amplified mixers (different applications), a small, desktop USB powered mixer to do podcasting with, encouraged a friend to order a powered Behringer mixer for his church (which he has told me works very well), and now I ordered these microphones, and they all have exceeded what you would expect from their price.	1
I had some band mates that did not seem to respect my Shure SM-58 mics very well so I bought some of these cheap mics to use on them. I was very surprised to find that I like the sound of my voice better through one of these than my old reliable SM-58 (and these Behringer mic's are about 1/10 the price each.  No problem with feedback or handling noise No problem with electronic induced noise Sounds good Dirt cheap Handy carrying case  What's not to like?	1
Pros: -Solid build quality -Included flight case, mic clips, and adapters (3/8" female threads to 5/8" male threads) -Clean audio -Great for live sound events  Cons: -Limited upper frequency response--this is to be expected in almost all dynamic mics.	1
My band had no PA or mics or anything.  While I admit these are not the quality a band will work up to, they fill up the stands at an affordable price.  Not much distance--you have to "eat" the mics--but the sound is great.  Full range, clear (not muddy), and no breaking up of sound.  This is a great place to begin.	1
I bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast, verbal audio recordings.  The sound quality is very good from these mics, in fact its hard to distinguish the difference on non-pro mixers from other higher end mics.  They feel good in your hand, nice build quality, and if you put a windscreen on them there is very little pop.  Sensitivity is good, and I'm very pleased by this purchase.  I'd definitely recommend these for any kind of audio recording, they may even be a good option for instrument recording given the lower price tag.  NOTE: once you put the pop screens on, they no longer fit into the carry case.  You have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case.	1
I wasn't expecting these mics to be this great. I read a few of the lukewarm customer ratings and decided to order them any way to use as backup mics. On a gig last week I hooked one up and switched between the Behringer and my usual mic a PG-58 and I'm sorry to say I couldn't tell the difference. I don't know how these would hold up over time but I'm impressed with their sound and the solid feel of the mic itself. I would recommend these mics to any one.	1
I use these at parties and they work good for the price I paid. I really have no complaints aside from sometimes you really have to get up on it to get a good clear voice in a live band setting. I use a wireless for that now, still for the price, these are hard to beat.	1
If you are on a budget these mics are great, for your karaoke system should be perfect. They say you get what you pay for but actually for the first time I came out on top.	1
This is my second set of these; just needed more of them when the Karaoke goes into Harmony mode! :) I am not a techie about sound products; we just wanted something cost effective that would work with our system. These do the trick just fine...until we can afford to go wireless.	1
I have used high-dollar mics for podcast and bought these for extra guest. I discover they are just as good on the recording as a 250 condenser mic. Worth every penny. buy them now.	1
All 3 of the mics provided work just fine.  Although they are not the best mics available, they work perfectly for my mobile DJ Setup.  I use one and I have the other two connected for anytime someone from the party wants to say a few words.	1
great price and helped out with recording to a Tascam 4 track cassette (which I like using on occasion vs digital) and just plain useful with so many other apps......excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage!!!	1
I've had Behringer mikes before, and currently have a couple of XM2000s, which are very reliable and comparable to Shure SM 58s. I saw this three pack of 1800s for $40 in a hard case and couldn't believe it. I hooked them up right beside the 2000s, and while there is a little difference, it's not much. The 1800 has a little more high end, but it's easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass. The presence is also boosted a little on the 1800, meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback. For now, I'm using the matched 1800s as the main mikes for our vocalists, and keeping the older 2000s as backups. I bought the 3 of these for less than the price of one SM 58. Although the Shure (and the B 2000) is better, the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for. I can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup. A wise choice for the budget conscious.	1
I use these for a music podcast and purchased them primarily for their price and durability. I needed several inexpensive mics that could be thrown around a little, still work, and have a cardioid polar pattern. These fit the bill and I have not had any issues with them at all.  I'm not saying that these mics are better than any other in quality, they are not noticeably terrible so that is a plus. They work when needed and that is what you should expect from them.  More than happy on my end!	1
Now I'm not claiming these are very high quality sound, but the construction is durable and they all work.  I keep this set as a backup and the case is worth the money alone.	1
These mics are great. I wasn't sure what they would be like but I would buy them all again. They are cheap enough to replace and they sound great. We Shure mics and they needed repaired all the time. These have a bigger sound pick up area and they have not had any problems at all.	1
Sound is solid and clear, no pops or noise when we use the switch.  Great value for the purchase price.	1
I had bad results with another Behringer product, but took the chance because of the price and also because these come in a set with carrier. I'm glad I did. They have worked perfectly.	1
Bought these to take down to a friend in the West Indies who often hosts shows -- and who lost a couple house mics after a fund raiser.  Long story short, a fellow musician friend of mine A-B'd them against a couple of my Shure mics and a high end Beyer M88 I use for gigging:  The Beyer easily won but the Shures didn't.  Beta 58 sounded pretty much just like the Behringer; SM58 just beat them out.  Amazing given the price difference!	1
I am glad I bought this. It is exactly what was described and it was a good price. Get it.	1
Order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring. I didn't think  that these mikes would give me the quality sound I needed for the price i paid.	1
Microphones work like a charm! I would order again if I had to. Thank you! If you order these, order the longer cords.	1
Hands down the best vocal mics you could possibly buy for forty bucks. Clear and precise for any kind of use. Not to mention other mics in this price range don't have on/off switches or a foam padded case for transport.	1
Behringer is an industry standard and these mics perform that way.  You really can't go wrong with these mics, Great price and these mics sound good, very flat sound.  You won't be disappointed.	1
These are great little mics that I picked up for a podcast that my buddies and I do ([...] and they work really well! The sound is super clean for just speaking and talking. We have these paired with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Behringer-Xenyx-802-Premium-8-Input-2-Bus-Mixer-with-Xenyx-Mic-Preamps-and-British-EQs/dp/B000J5XS3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Behringer Xenyx 802 Premium 8-Input 2-Bus Mixer with Xenyx Mic Preamps and British EQs</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Behringer-AMP800-Four-Channel-Headphone-Amp/dp/B000KU87SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Behringer AMP800 Four Channel Headphone Amp</a>.

All this compbined works really well for our show.	1
These microphones have a quality-feel to them and they all worked perfectly.  I used them with my Harbinger HA60 PA system and I was not disappointed.  They don't come with cables so be sure you have some available (xlr-xlr).  You can get a 25' cable for under $5 also here on Amazon.  Good deal all around.  Would not hesitate to purchase more of them if I need to.	1
For my Karaoke Business these Microphones are perfect...Clear and sharp...Unless you hold this up to speaker, no feedback...don't be dissuaded by their inexpensive price, they deliver a Big Price sound on a small budget!!	1
Okay well I lied in subject line, bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand.  I can say that with authority since I run KJ shows 6 nights a week and have for the last 20+ years, so I know good singers when I hear them.  And they will ask if I have a shure SM58, to which i reply Hell No, you think I'm going to put a 58 in the hands of a careless drunk?  The more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe.  Some also drop the mic or worse, spike the mic.  I'd rather lose one of these Behringers than a 58.  Or a wireless 58.  Sound wise these are great for their intended purpose.  If you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic, this is the bargain.	1
THE MICS HAVE GREAT SOUND AND THE CASE IS NOT BAD EITHER I LOVE BEHRINGER EQUIPMENT SEEMS TO BE ALL I BUY NOW THEY HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED AT A LOWER COST AND HIGH QUALITY	1
Best buy for the money, I love Behringer for quality and price, if some one tells you about hard circuit boards breaking, its bull, mine are run thru the mill every weekend, they also work as a backup microphone for vocals if you would need them, great price and value !!!	1
This product works pretty well. I might think about buying some more in the near future. Yes I can recomend this to someone.	1
These mics work well on a podium and I would say that they pick up sound well at a fair distance, meaning you don't have to put it on your lips to hear what people are saying. I will purchase again.	1
These microphones are great for recording vocals.  They pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds.  They do not have any detectable noise or issues.  Depending on your situation, you may need to have a external pop-filter or windscreen, however, these microphones contain an internal windscreen.	1
I bought them at 45 dollars. Use for small music gigs and DJ/MC uses. They are great for DJ uses or other things where the quality of the voice isn't so important, as long as you can be heard and understood. I recommend for use of: 1. Small music venues (smaller bands), Djing, public speaking, band practices/rehearses, etc. For higher quality microphones at a reasonable price, look at the Audix OM2 when it's around 80 bucks, or Audio Technica products.	1
The sound quality, and price is awesome. I saved money, and gotten great quality from these mikes. They sound like more expensive ones I've seen!!	1
First off, I'm not professional, just tried to set up a home based karaoke system.  Before I bought this, I tried Axess MP1504-BLK Professional Dual Wireless Microphone, which is pretty plastic, light weighted, cannot compare with this mic.  This mic is very solid in hand, feeling good.  I also purchased Yamaha MG82CX, they work very well together.  I think these two items are essential elements for home karaoke system.	1
It is nice for voices.  good quality and you can feel the difference from other product.  I compared with competence... and quality versus prices..ufff  this is better..	1
Great Product!  Great Price!  Great Packaging!  Great Quality!  What can I say, GREAT People to do business with.  I look forward to picking up more stuff with them in the future.  Thanks fellas!  Cheers ><>	1
i received them and was more than what i had expected could not ask for more than price some mikcs were better than expensive mics	1
If you're a professional and you're JOB is music, then you may not think these mics are up to your standards in quality.  However, if you're just doing it as a hobby/side job... or even just want the mics for a PA system, then it's really hard to beat what you get in this deal here.  The deal is fantastic.  I use these for recording music at my home as well as recording my online radio show and they've been perfect for me.	1
This item was received well packed and on time.  Provides a great sound for my needs and would recommend it to all my friendks.	1
This set is the best deal around it serves the purpose nicely. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a inexpensive set of mics.	1
Between Amazon's price and the good sound and function of these mikes everyone should get a set.  They work great for our church band and I've put the Shures away to save for recording only.  At just over $10 a piece they're a great deal.	1
I would have given this item 5 stars if the low end was just a wee bit better.  Kind of expected for the price, but after reading many reviews with people comparing this mic to a Shure SM58, I wanted people to know that it's got all the mids and highs of an SM58 and sounds like the lows were rolled off a bit.  Not a big issue, just bump up your low EQ and you're back in business.  I bought these to keep in my recording studio for when my bands have band practice.  This way I don't have to keep packing and unpacking my road mics.  They will work beautifully, and I can use the nifty case for my other mics!!!  You can't go wrong at this price. THANKS AGAIN BEHRINGER!	1
Excellent equipment!  For the price I paid, can't beat what I got.  Have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them.  It's been several years now, and this is a name that will move forward in sound equipment.	1
I have to admit I was a little skeptic Buying this Mic Kit but for the price I was willing to take the chance! They all work fine and they come in handy for drums as well! You got to love it! The price is so nice I bought them twice!	1
I love these microphones, I really do. I also believe that it was really cool they threw in the microphone holders and the case is quite nice. The 2 things I did not like was 1, the microphone has to be really close to your mouth to get a good sound out of it, otherwise it does not sound as crisp. 2, although it was nice of them to include the microphone holders, the items they work with are very limited so make sure that they match up with a microphone stand you want to buy or else it won't screw in. It is good to be aware the wire that connects to this microphone is an XLR Female, so buy the correct wire when connecting to an amp/speaker. For the price I really do recommend these, as long as your fine with having to put the microphone centered,and close to your mouth. Overall a great product.	1
I have a small home studio and wanted to purchase come cheap dynamic mics to fill out my library of microphones. I would mostly use these mics for recording individual drums like a snare or tom, and guitar amps. After reading other peoples reviews of these mics, I decide to give them a try. I figured for the price I did not have much to lose. I bought these mics in a three pack for under $50.00. I have only tried one of them so far, but it sounds pretty darn good. I would almost compare this mic to a Sure Sm58 in sound. I think the Sure sounds slightly warmer, but it also costs more than all three of these mics combined. Plus these Behringers came with a traveling case, and mic clips for all three mics. These mics sound good, and don't feel cheap at all. People will see and hear these and think you spent much more than you did. I tried one of these mics dry and the sound was decent and would work for what I was looking to do with them (record drums and guitar amps), but then I put a good tube pre amp on the same mic and it sounded great. I would even consider recording some vocals with this mic and that pre-amp. Seriously Im amazed myself, recording vocals with a $15 dollar mic! I honestly think you can not do better than these mics for the amount spent.	1
Podcasting on a bit of a budget ($200 setup), I wanted good sound quality, nice warm tones .... these mics deliver in a world where I didn't quite have the cash for condensers I wanted.  I needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word, these sound great.  3 for under $40 was fantastic.  I am glad I didn't break budget here.  I'm using these with the Behringer 1202FX mixer.  I am so extremely happy with them.	1
So happy with this purchase.  I am very choosy with my purchases especially with musical instruments because this is an investment.  Anyhow, I purchased this mics after reading all the reviews.  I am a frugal person so I am trying to minimize all the cost of the instruments BUT without taking the quality.  I think $50 will be a big loss IF i ended up unhappy with the mics because I am ordering from Bahrain.  If I am unhappy, I have to pay back for the shipping which is will be MORe than the cost of the mic back and forth.  In my surprise after getting it, we run to our home studio, plugged it and used it.  We are very satisfied with the sound.  These mics sounds the same as the SM58 of Shure. I would advise everyone to use XLR cables for both ends.  This will give big quality difference and dB gains.	1
Surprised really. For the price I don't think I could have done better. Nice case, come with stand adapters, and make me sound pretty good and I cant really sing. Dropped one a few times and its still working. Good feel/weight. On /off switches on each. I record to DAW and the recordings sound fine. I usually run everything through a BBE so that might be part of why I am pleased with them but I do recocmmend these for mics in this price range.	1
I bought these microphones because the price seemed good and the case looked sturdy.  I planned to use one microphone for doing video interviews, and the other two as backups or if I had a project needing more than one microphone.  These microphones really pick up well and send a strong signal.  They can be used within close proximity or even a couple feet away from my mouth (or an instrument) and they still pick up strong.  In terms of tonal response, they are fine. You'd probably have to spend a lot more money to get better sound. They sound better than $100 name brand microphones I bought about a decade ago for use wit a live band.  At first when I tested the microphone I found it so sensitive that I thought it would pick up the slightest sound from my hand on the microphone (which it does).  However I put some tape on it, and when I got out "into the field" the level of input as I spoke plus the ambient sound drowned out any "handling noise" which is to say they worked very well indeed.  I would highly recommend these microphones for live performance, studio, or field work.  The case is really nice and these microphones look to be very good quality and sturdy. Their sound is very good and anyone would be hard pressed to think you didn't lay out $100 a microphone for these (and as I said, there are $100 microphones out there that do a much worse job).	1
Comes in a really nice case.  Works great.  Great price. Very light.  Can't speak to durability because haven't had them long and haven't used them heavily.	1
These work great. Low noise, and if they get lifted, you don't lose much. Love the case. Work great with all the other Behringer gear we already use.	1
This is An outstanding microphone for the price and the case with it is great I use it for live productions and it's perfect. It is about as good as shure microphones but not as powerful	1
These are pretty standard dynamic mics, and for what you pay the quality is good. I use them as room mics mainly, for which they perform admirably. I've only used them once for (backup) vocals, and the results were good. Would recommend these for folks on a budget. Also, the case is nice.	1
These don't sound all that great on stage or at rehearsal with the my other SM58s and Beta 58s in a band situation, but that actually wasn't the purpose of these microphones... the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system, at which they excel. The facility we use these at, the mics have a habit of walking away, or escaping maybe... stolen? Perhaps. They sound great through the ceiling, they have on/off switches, and they're cheap, we can just buy another box of 3 in a few months when we're down to 1 again. Seems like they'll last forever, too bad they keep wandering off on us.	1
For the price of this set of microphones, you can't go wrong. They sound good through my mixer. Usually you'd pay around $50 for just one microphone of this quality. The carry case and mic clips are a bonus. However, I would not recommend these microphones for gigging. They may not be able to handle drops, or any other kind of abuse.	1
El articulo adquirido fue recibido en  buen estado y  a tiempo. La categoria del vendedor es excelente en cuanto a responsabilidad.	1
Alright, these mics are very affordable and the have plenty of power. They seem to be constructed well ( as I haven't used them at a show as of yet) however they feel heavy and durable. The sound which they have is as others mentioned on a warm bassy side, however I just turned down the lows a bit and they are terrific. Really terrific. An on/off switch is a total plus and honestly if you are getting a mic of this quality for 12 dollars per microphone, in a case, with clips and they work well.... truly a total score. Buy and buy often ( and I don't work for the company...lol).	1
Made of all metal,looks and feels well made. Sounds clear no hum or buzz comes with a nice case and that a plus.	1
Wow! I've never seen such a great deal.  I can't believe the price for what you get out of this package.  First of all, these microphones are fantastic.  They are clear, they are rock solid, and they sound fantastic.  Second, they come with a blow-molded hardcase that is lined with foam cut perfectly to hold all of the microphones while you carry them from one gig to the next.  Third, THERE ARE THREE OF THEM!  I cannot believe how good of a deal this is.  I'm tempted to order another set just so I don't miss out when this deal is no longer available.	1
I'm a photographer exploring videography. I already have a expensive boom, condenser and lav mic system. I use them all with my Zoom H4N audio recorder that has XLR inputs. But I wanted extra mics with XLR inputs for situations involving more than one mic, and for back up also.  I figured if these turn out to be crap, SO WHAT! They didn't really cost much, and if so, I would simply give them to my daughter to play around with.  I now use these microphones all the time when recording HDSLR video, and they haven't disappointed me yet. When recording footage that involves music or vocals, I've been able to make any corrections needed with an EQ and/or recording level adjustments.  The mics have good sound quality, made of metal, and cost less than a good xlr cable. When you factor price for three all metal mics, clips, and a hard case... this is a ridiculous value.  Buy em'. There are too cheap to have any buyers remorse.	1
this pack rocks they have on off buton the quality feels sturdy and I had it next to shure mics that cost more but sound the same for karaoke vocals. I bough two other sets and 20 ft cables	1
I was looking for a financially good deal. The price was so reasonable, I said, "How can something this cheap be that good",..well they were a great investment. I use them all the time and have had people ask me where I purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone. When I told them the price, they thought I was pulling there leg,..I wasn't. The case is plastic, foam and clips. Three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone, now compare for yourself. I'd buy these again in a heart beat. I just might buy another 3-pack!!	1
I've only used the mics a few times so far, so I can't comment on how long they'll last, but they sound just fine for me for vocals, live.	1
Very good price and the sound quality is comparable to really expensive Mic. please ignore the Mic holders that come in the case they are garbage. i guess if you get a good case and Mic you should be happy. if this is a rush order please order three Mic holders separately.	1
Great mic for great price - helps me with acoustic amplification - straight into Mackie mixer and out to powered QSC K10.	1
I use them for small backyard shows.  They work great, I can't really comment studio recording quality - but quality though a medium P.A. system is great.  They are nice enough that I wouldn't want to throw them around like an idiot, but cheap enough that if I do throw one around like an idiot and break it (which I think is unlikely, they feel pretty durable - and I'm not an idiot, lol) I won't be too upset.  I defiantly recommend!  Enjoy, John	1
I've been using this mics for over 5 years now and I'm really impressed by their performance and endurance.  I've had the chance to compare them on-stage with other famous and more expensive brands and let me tell you my Behringers perform way better than most of them.  Less feedback due to their great (real) uni-direction capabilities.  I bought two 3-packs and their are still in working condition after years of use and abuse.  Nowadays I'm performing with a latin band and my mics have provided great satisfaction in every show.  I will definitely buy 2 three-packs more to ensure good performances for the years to come.	1
Excellent value - you can't do much better!  The voice quality of these microphone is surprising.  For a public address system, I don't think you can do a hole lot better for the money.	1
The 3-pack is a FANTASTIC deal. I've been around mics under $100 for 30 years, and when compared to other mics in the $50-$100 range, they are as good or better! Good lows and clean highs without ANY hiss. Absolutely NO whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp. Don't miss out on this GREAT deal.	1
This is a great set of microphones. I've used them for years and they are still in very good working conditions.  I've dropped them many times, they have proven to be really sturdy.  Very accurate unidirectional sound pick up.  I have 9 in three cases, the cases are also very useful.  Fully recommend buying this product.	1
I have been fortunate enough to play real tube amps for most of my playing years. I spent a few years working with guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen and it was there that I really came to appreciate the combination of a vintage Marshall and good OD pedal. But let's be serious. If you are a considerate person who does not want to bother neighbors, it takes much work to tame the volume of a loud amp rig like that. I ended up using an Alex Attenuator @ -12 db and also placing the speaker cabs in a large soundproof closet I built in the garage for $1500. Add to that we have almost 2 acres of land and you get the picture. Even with all that, there is still a rumble in the house when playing these classic non master volume Marshalls. I can't play the old vintage gear when the wife is trying to sleep even with the amps at the opposite end of a 2700 sq ft house.  Another thing is I feel the vintage tube amps and OD pedals are the best you can use for getting everything from Clean Blues to Hendrix to Iron Maiden/Yngwie levels of gain ------------ However, this kind of setup is not the ideal gear for getting that modern ultra-tight Megadeth kind of tone. The vintage amps just get too loose on the low end when pushed to that level.  For that Megadeth kind of hi-gain sound, using the GSP1101 into a power amp (or power amp loop in of tube amp) is PERFECT for getting that sound at any desired volume. In fact between years 2007 -2011, Megadeth used the GSP1101 on tour. The Rust In Piece LIVE show on DVD was done with the GSP1101.  Also this Digitech can do a "very good" job of allowing the player on a budget, needing a wide range of tones, or not able to play loud to emulate a wide range of classic tones. TRUE .... if you are sitting in a studio with a real vintage Marshall tube amp from 70s with a classic gray DOD 250 overdrive pedal and you A/B that against the GSP1101 models of this same amp and pedal into a power amp you CAN EASILY hear the difference.  No surprise there -- You can't beat the real thing.  But I would say the GSP1101 can get you 75-80% of the way there when running thru a nice TUBE POWER AMP. Certainly in the full mix of a song, the average listener will not know the difference. Of course the touch response is not the same as a real tube amp - but to be honest -- NONE of the emulators on the market or even modern master volume amps will have the same response to picking as a vintage non-master volume amp running full out on 10. There is something about the way Power Tubes and Transformers respond to picking when they are pushed hard that they can't yet truly copy with the digital stuff. But to be honest, this is more important for medium heavy gain and lighter tones. If you are only an all out hi-gain shredder, then you are not as concerned about touch response --- you probably like the compressed leveling effect to make fast scales and sweeps easier and smoother sounding.  So if you can't afford $2800 for a Fractal AXE unit (which will get you about 90% there) --OR-- you can't afford the $$$$$$ or the loudness of a large genuine vintage gear collection, then I feel the Digitech GSP1101 is the best preamp out today for the money.  At $399 (the typical price as of the day I wrote this review) it gives you a whole bunch of BANG FOR THE BUCK !!  I now use it for all my practice, late night song writing, recording modern "Megadeth" style songs , etc..... I have made patches to emulate as closely as possible my favorite tones from my vintage set up.  I fall back on the genuine vintage gear when the house is empty and/or I want to recorded a genuine classic rock sound ranging from Hendrix to EVH to Yngwie to Maiden in heaviness.  Bottom Line -- All practice, songwriting and rehearsing for all my tones is now done on the GSP1101 running into an EL-34 equipped Power Amp. I also use the GSP1101 whenever I need a tone that is Megadeth style or Heavier in the modern style.  If the house is empty and/or I am recording a song that needs a rock tone like Hendrix, Clapton, Yngwie, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, etc....  then I prefer to use the real vintage amps and effects if possible.  BUT ... with that said, If I was just starting out and did not have the $$$$ to buy all the vintage stuff I could certainly get away using the GSP1101 for almost everything. For $400 it really is impressive and I like the X-Edit PC software too.	1
Bought this to replace my ancient ADA MP1 that died on me. This preamp rocks! First of all it's so easy to program - that's a big plus. I think all the presets are OK and a good starting off point. Secondly it sounds real good. It cleans up nicely when rolling off the volume and responds to picking dynamics. I have a POD HD500 as well and I find myself playing the Digitech more often. It's certainly easier to navigate and program.  On the other hand...It's just not a tube preamp, it sounds digital to me, not that that is a bad thing. I'm running stereo into a 50/50 Carvin tube power amp and a 2x12 Bag End cab with ancient Greenbacks. It's a preamp so it's going to sound different for every amp/cab it's running into. Another thing I really like is it has global EQ paramaters that are easy to work with and you can turn the cab modelling off globally as well. I'm not sure about deep editing but I think the HD500 has it beat in that area.  I don't really care for USB/PC/editor thing. Line 6's monkey kills them on this. I messed around for hours trying to get the drivers to work and the USB connection to be recognized. Luckily it's easy to program it manually on the front panel. There's a Beta site out there but it's bare bones and really confusing.  Bottom line: I like it, the price is right, and I would recommend it.	1
great device.  took a little getting used to as I am in a duo with harmony arleady.  We just had to look for places to inject harmony so that the machine was not duplicating what we were already singing.  It's a great sounding device and if the harmony output level is kept low the effect is subtle enough to turn heads but not so obvious as to sound like back up tracks.  I would recommend this device to anyone who wants a fuller and more exciting vocal sound.  The guitar effects are ok, but nothing special.  The price I got throught Amazon was a full 100 dollars less than typical prices elsewhere so this was a "win win"	1
I purchased this tuning pickup because of Petersons reputation (I own a Stomp Classic and Stroboclip as well) and this connected seamlessly with my iPhone adapter to tune my acoustics with my iStrobosoft iPhone app. Money well spent	1
I have a Boss TU-12 that I use to tune acoustic guitar, acoustic bass, mandolin and ukulele.  The tuner never gave me stable readings, especially with the uke.  The TP-2 solved all of those problems.  It provides a very steady reading on the tuner needle and really makes accurate tuning acoustic instruments very easy.  It works pretty well on my electric guitars also!  The only down side to this pickup is that the cable is a little thin and I'm not sure how it will stand up to constant stage use.	1
If your pickup goes bad frequently, this is the pickup for you.  The webbing on the outside of the pickup protects the pickup from damage by pulling. The pickup is VERY long, which is both good and bad.  In some cases, you want the room to move around, and know to adjust for length.  However, I have caught my foot in the pickup while moving among my instruments, so I have shortened it by using the attached velcro. It leaves a bunch of velcro-ed lead, but it gives me a lot of flexibility.  I LOVE the webbing, which makes the pickup more protected from damage,  I have not had to replace this pickup since I bought it; about 2x the longevity of my previous pickups	1
It seems to have issues with hearing. The microphone on the tuner seemed to pick up faster. Peterson hd tuner.	1
A good useful addition for my tuner.  Nice long cord as well makes things work well.  May not be the best for all instruments.	1
it works	1
Definite advantage for tuning the acoustic.  Right price.	1
Good Job	1
Excellent product and seller.	1
When I pay top dollar for a Rode product I expect it to work in a professional environment and this product has been a disappointment. Yes, it does isolate the handling noise of a boom pole quite well but the rubber bands do not support the weight of my Rode NTG-3 mic. The mic sags in the bands and tends to fall out of the mount in use. Good thing the mic cable was still holding the mic or my mic would have crashed to the ground several times. Plus, you look like a fool when you flub the take because your mic slid out of the mount. I even wrapped a rubber band around the mic base to "catch" on the mount's rubber and the mic still slid out of the mount. This mount sort of works on a static boom but is pretty much worthless on a hand held boom pole.	-1
I purchased this to go between my entry-level Rode boom pole and my Audio-Technica ATM-897 short shotgun mic.  It stood up to ten days of location shooting with medium to heavy usage.  I have no complaints about its construction so far, although I am concerned about the longevity of the friction hinge (would have preferred something with a nut to loosen or tighten).  This was great for the price.	1
I didn't think this cheap pedal would be all I needed, but it is!  Great for using live DAWs.	1
Excelente	1
Let me begin by saying that I am happy with this product. It does what I expected at a decent price. My use case it as a general purpose expression pedal to use alongside my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Novation-midi-controller/dp/B005M02VNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Novation midi controller</a>&nbsp;for various soft instruments (organ, synth and others).  Physically the device seems robust enough, though looking more closely there is a plastic coupling, which I assume physically translates the rocker action to a linear potentiometer. The little plastic pin through a plastic loop doesn't inspire me with confidence but for now it's working fine (and probably subject to less shock than a sustain pedal). The action is well damped and it has a polarity switch as well as a trim for the pot.  In use it does what I'd expect. It gave the full range of midi values over its range of motion and held any position I set it to when I removed my foot. Expression is quite a broadly supported midi dimension so it tends to work as a volume adjustment in most soft instruments without configuration. As one might expect it can also be mapped in much the same was the modulation wheel.  I was interested in trying it out in a different mode of operation, that's to say arrange that it returned to one end of its motion range as I released it. I did this by wrapping an elastic band around the end of the pedal nearest the cable. In this setup I placed my toe on the open end of the pedal (like a piano damper) rather than placing my foot on the pedal and it worked nicely. I found that having resistance to work against allowed for more deliberate and smooth control of the expression.  Overall, assuming this lasts, it's probably the best pedal you can get for the money. If it were a little more robustly constructed (with some carefully employed metal parts) it would have been five stars.	1
Volume jumps while fading in strings, for example, on my keyboard. Very noticeable, very bad. Defective pedal? Maybe, but this is the 2nd M-Audio product to fail me in the past month. I also have an SP-2 sustain pedal which has started squeaking after 2 months of ownership. Until M-Audio's QA improves, I'm done with their hardware. As a musician, the RMA process sucks because they make you ship it back before they send a replacement (you pay for shipping). In the meantime, you're without a pedal for a week or more. They need to rethink that. Seriously.	-1
M-Audio is awesome. This expression pedal is the thing I needed and works well.	1
Does not work with my M-Audio Oxygen 25.	-1
Perfect for the price.	1
Using this to control the variable overdrive on a Roland GA212 pedal board. Gives me complete control of parameters on the amp via foot control. Would purchase again. Haven't tried it on any of my keyboards yet as I bought it specifically for this guitar/pedalboard usage.	1
Works great. I use this to only control volume when using my USB midi controller keyboard. So far so good	1
I bought this pedal to use on Guitar Midi Controller Axon MK II. I must say I din't but buy it from music 123. It was Seetwater which at the time had the lowest price $29. My big mistake I didn't buy it from Amazon. Pedal came fast and from start did nothing I even tried it on Line 6 NADA. I went through the whole manual in my Axon not a thing . The manual for Pedal was one page few lines and said easy set up and the fact this is a Universal. I sent an email to see what is going on . It seemed they sent me a Pedal that was returned may be by BIG FOOT. Sure $10 less than anyone else is the way to go and more than likely not tested.  I called support the guy keep talking what key board I used. My answer to him, why key board  why you  bringing key board. WHY? The support did not know Axon. Some of may not know but a support must know it. AXON is a Midi controller for guitar synthesizer which allow guitar player through 13 pin cable get different tone such as piano whole lot. It is not that easy think before putting any money in this field. Any way the support in seetwarer is a joke. This Pedal is made to be broken If I go to car BODY SHOP and say I have a broken Fender Ultra  I expect the guy ask what company make this car or Fender but I am talking about Fender guitar ultra w/ebony fret board. Most car do have Fender. that is why, SUPPORT in a music franchise should know Pedals are not only for Key Boards and then act like I am an idiot.  I am sure I am not clear to all of you,but those who had dealt with Guitar synthesizer know what I am taking about and know about AXON 100 MK II with two Expression Pedal inputs, simple doesn't have to be a key boards. Now you 30 days to return but you have to pay return shipping about $10, plus in addition Seetwater deduct at least $6 to $10 shipping cost although it was free shipping. Make $10 times 2 your time frustration driving to post office to get $9 you do the math. If you still like to buy this junk buy it through Amazon and its second to none return policy I am mostly a buyer than seller. This is my experience, Facts has nothing to do with Amazon.or music 123. I purchased from music 123 with no problem. This pedal is a junk. If you still want to buy it make sure it is new not a return. I have other M.Audio product working well. Don't be a victim if Pedal is bad and replacement or return would cost you. Happy new year and good luck.	-1
Let me start off by saying that I am using the M-Audio EX-P for my guitar pedal; Boss SYB-5. I found it ironic that this is for a keyboard but it fails to work on my Casio while succeeds with working for my SYB-5 ( Synth pedal). Nonetheless, I got this pedal specifically for my pedals, not my keyboard. The EX-P has held up really well so far, dropped about 2 times. It is made out of plastic and has a rubber grip for the foot-switch. It comes with a knob to adjust the range of the delay, sound or whatever you need it for, which is pretty nice to have. It works great with all my Boss pedals and I have not yet tried it on any other brand. Overall I am very satisfied with this pedal, for the price you can't go wrong with it.  Pros : Compact size, Different Settings, Responsive, Works great with guitar pedals. Cons : Plastic, does not work with all keyboards	1
For a value price, this unit works extremely well. I am using it with my Boss  RT-20 Rotary Sound processor. It has a great feel and works smoothly. No sound distortion. For the price, it seems to be a great item.	1
The actuator arm that connects between the pot shaft and exp pedal was cracked completely through the collar that attaches to pot shaft. It arrived loose off the shaft. Rather than going through the hassle of sending back, I fixed it by wrapping the collar with a small, good tie strap, tightly. Problem solved. For $22 it's not worth the headache of returning with the probability of getting another DOA. It's not the fault of the vendor, their prices and shipping expedience are tops. Just be aware if it fails, that's a good place to start looking.	-1
I'm the first review?  These 80/20 bronze have been around a long time, sort of classic as I think of them. Maybe the packaging is new.  These are bright, chimey and jangly. Don't expect a woody, bluegrass, or drednaught type sound... these turn your acoustic into a Rickenbacher. Custom lights will allow you to do bends, but you do lose a little punch.  These have been the strings on a nice rosewood acoustic for me about last 8 years, a perfect fit. Nothing sounds quite like them, and use brass pins if you want to increase the vibe.	1
wonderfull	1
Just replaced the strings on my Taylor acoustic guitar with this set. I wanted to make it a bit easier to play my guitar and it has. In addition the volume from the Medium strings to these light strings did not make much difference in tone or sound quality.	1
Great strings and great price.	1
Easy to play on a D-15M.	1
I have tried Dean Markley, Fender, Gibson, and GHS strings and they were so so. Lately I've been using Diadario strings on my acoustics and loves the tone and playability but had problems with the d and g strings breaking. So far these Martins have been GREAT! Fantastic tone and easy playing. Thus far nice and strong so they get an A+!!	1
Great Strings!	1
This is a perfect clarinet stand. Lightweight, rugged, collapsible, and inexpensive. I would absolutely recommend this model. I own two of these.	1
This stand is very light and compact when folded, but very sturdy and balanced with a clarinet on it. Great product.	1
I didn't expect much from this stand, and I am shocked at how awesome it is!  It sits on any surface without tipping over or leaning!  Definitely a worthwhile purchase!	1
It is affordable, sturdy, and compact when put away. I would recommend it to all my clarinet friends. I don't know how well it works for piccolos and trumpets.	1
It arrived quickly, and I'm very impressed.  It takes up minimal space, and 4 feet are always better than three.  They are mounted on a threaded plastic piece which screws into the bottom of the holder.  When you unscrew it, the entire piece comes out, the feet fall into position, and you screw it back in for a sturdy holder.  Very clever, lightweight, and I'm hoping will probably be useable until lost or stolen.  The only negative:  It's obviously made for a soprano clarinet, so trumpet, cornet, flute, and piccolo players need to look for something else.  And about taking up space:  I'm buying an inexpensive, but sturdy briefcase which will be gutted, foam rubber added, and clarinet joint spaces cut out.  There will be plenty of room for this stand and other accessories.	1
I like this stand as it well built and strongly made. However, it is light enough to be easily portable and carried with you to gigs. There are few adjustments that can be made to tailor the height of the stand to your needs. It is stable and sturdy with no fear of it tipping over. I have been using this in my classroom for over 5 years and it is just as good as new.	1
Hey it gets a workout from my son. Good product no complaints	1
I can set my instrument down without the fear of someone stepping on it.	1
Very Nice!	1
I was very happy to have this stand for use in orchestra (where we have long intervals of multiple-measure rests). My old trombone has neither assembly nor slide locks, so being able to adjust the height of the bell support and the depth of the inside-tube support was critical for me. This has extremely sturdy construction, very solid thumb screws, a nice soft landing for the bell and the inside-tube support. So the instrument is both secure and undamaged by use. The legs spread widely and low to the floor to reduce tripping hazard and to make a very sturdy placement for your instrument. Very high quality stand in my opinion	1
I've been looking for a nice electric guitar stand for a while now. Every point that makes contact with the guitar is covered in a very sturdy and supportive rubber that protects the finish of your guitar as it sits. It's very sturdy and it folds up in seconds. This stand is incredible in it's simplicity and build quality.	1
This is a great guitar stand! It's extremely stable (even on carpet) and folds up to easy travel. Would recommend to any guitarist!	1
I needed a stand to keep at the house where our band practices, that was small enough to be out of the way and sturdy enough to make me comfortable using it with expensive guitars.  This is perfect.  It folds up small enough to tuck inside the back of my 1 x 12 amp that I leave over there as well.	1
This stand holds my telecaster perfectly and fits in the front pocket of my roadrunner case.  It's perfect for taking on the road and doesn't take up too much space!  It sits very firm on the ground. I will definitely buy another!	1
Short enough and wide enough so it won't overbalance and send your beloved Strat crashing to the floor, rubber footed so it won't slide, and tall enough to support the guitar body.  Excellent.	1
The built is super and it is exactly the same  width as the K&M multiporpose that I bought for my acoustic.	1
This a real nice stand, it is constructed well, the guitar sits in place, the stand folds up and folds out easy as pie.  I will difintely purchase another for my second guitar.	1
This K & M clarinet stand is terrific. The bottom support legs are connected to a center screw that screws into the funnel, with the legs either folded out for use or folded up for storage inside the funnel. The stored size is 2 and 5/8 inches wide by 6 and 1/4 inches long--small enough to fit in some clarinet cases but not most. Both Bb and Eb soprano clarinets sit firmly and securely on the stand, which won't tip over. They also won't get stuck on the stand or bruised by the stand, and the stand is very light weight. Brilliant design and highly recommended.	1
The stand arrived on time and was just as described. It fits in my hard Yamaha case, just as promised. I like it!	1
My clarinet has never sounded better!	1
Fits my Selmer CL300 fine. Stores in the bell in my original Selmer case. Please note that the point of the stand sticks out a few inches.from the end of the bell. To fit in my case the tip must fit into the mouthpiece. It can do no harm here, but if your case has a separate mouthpiece compartment that is out of line with the bell this will probably not fit in your cas.  As for the stand itself it is great. It is compact and sturdy with excellent stability. I have no problem with entrusting my clarinet to it. Feel free to ask questions. I will be glad to try to help.	1
This is the cleverest thing. It is made in Germany. Very high quality. The legs screw out from the bottom. It is easy, quick, and fits inside the bell for storage. A very good buy.	1
My daughter loves it:)	1
Does the job very well, and it secures the instrument quite well.	1
Super convenient, light but robust and stable, the right shape for the bell, even a little felt ring to protect its rim. Fast to open and close (20 secs max). I always have it with me as I store it in the bell in my case when I travel. Super find!	1
It's perfect and fun to assemble in a flash.	1
My daughter loves this clarinet Bb stand.  Her instructor had one too and recommended this.	1
Works great. Well made protection for your instrument.	1
K&M are the best stands I've ever used. This is no exception.  When it arrived, it looked kind wimpy and I was reluctant to trust it with my Buffet R13, but over time, I have come to trust and love this stand. I never got to a gig without it.  **I am a band director and performance musician in and around the Cincinnati, OH area.	1
Sturdy and stable. Folds up neatly	1
Works great for my daughter's clarinet and stands up to alot of activity in her room; even on carpet it has not tipped over!	1
I bought this stand a year ago for my son playing the clarinet in his first year. The clarinet sits on it securely, and it folds up nice and compact. I had a hard time fitting it in the bell while stored in my son's case, so I cut the end of the stand off and the tips of the arms and filed them smooth. Now it fits perfectly and still works like a charm! I am NOT disappointed with this purchase and would recommend it to anybody looking for an inexpensive, heavy duty, compact stand.	1
Tiny, light, works very well. Solid.	1
This stand is so beneficial when I'm switching back and forth between oboe and clarinet. My oboe will not stand up on it's own, so I would have to hold it in my lap while playing clarinet (I don't recommend doing that). Now I can just set my instrument on this stand and not have to worry about it falling over.	1
fast service good price	1
Sturdy and portable.	1
Simple, elegant, reasonably priced, stable, seems robust so far. Small enough when folded that it fits in the clarinet box. Not too heavy. Necessary. What else can I add? If you have a clarinet and no stand, you need one of these.	1
Lightweight, yet compact and study, it really works well.	1
Excellent stand. Very high quality and easy to use even for a 6 YO girl.	1
Seems a little fragile at first. Gets the job done very well. Would recommend. Actually I was so pleased I bought one for a friend.	1
very neat and compact. holds my clarinet securely in upright position, then folds up and is easy to store.	1
Sturdy small stand, breaks down and fits perfectly in the bell of my clarinet.	1
great  excellent	1
I was having trouble figuring out where to put my clarinet while messing with reeds, etc.  I was afraid I would lay it on my lap and then bang it on my table.  So the stand is super convenient.  I did wish it had come with some English-language instructions.  I puzzled over it for five minutes, shaking it (I knew the little legs had to be in there somewhere), and then finally tried unscrewing the "legs unit", and then it was fine.  If I ever take it anywhere, I can see the convenience of taking off the legs (unscrew them), then screw them back into the main unit.....simple, once you know how!	1
Solid clarinet (and other) stand.  The legs are hinged to a central screw that allows the legs to fold up and store inside the central piece.  The legs are metal and very solid when screw in correctly.  Easy to use.  This stand will not fit within the bell alone.  If you have a case that allows the bell to stay connected to the lower joint, then this will store inside the clarinet while in the case.  If your bell stores seperate from the lower joint, then you will need to store this stand somewhere outside your case.  Happy with this purchase.	1
Received this in 2 days!!! I bought it for my son and he loves it.  The whole thing colapses to fit nicely into his clarinet's horn piece (great German engineering).  What I like is that the legs are made of metal and very sturdy.  I highly recommend this product.	1
I love this clarinet stand, especially the fact that it has a felt liner to cushion the bottom part of the bell. It seems to be stable and strong. I have pushed my barrel and mouthpiece onto the clarinet while it's sitting on this stand and it can withstand the extra pressure without breaking. The legs (arms?) are made of metal and the tips are rounded and smooth, it won't scratch the surface of your table / floor.	1
I got this for my sister, who is the clarinetist in the family.  I have one for my flute by the same manufacturer, K & M, and I loved it, so this was a gift.  She loves that it fits right inside her clarinet and doesn't need to have another item to haul around with her.	1
I've been using a couple of these stands for years for my Bb and A clarinets when I'm on the road. They fit easily into the bells of the instrument, although they do stick out a little at the top which might be a problem for some cases. These stands are very sturdy and the best of the collapsible variety.	1
This clarinet stand is very helpful for use it my classroom. I use this to hold my instrument in between teaching periods or when switching to another instrument. The stand is very compact when folded up. I also appreciate the felt to protect the bell. I do wish that it was a bit sturdier. It is pretty good, but just a little wobbly for my tastes.	1
This is a great stand.  More substantial than the Pack a Stand competition but significantly longer so it will go into the bell of your clarinet but stick out the other end of the bell for about 1 1/2 inches.  So it may be an issue depending on the arrangement of your case.  The Pack A Stand fits almost entirely in the bell.  In use the Pack a stand is fine but tends to hold on to the inside of the bell so when you pick the instrument up you'll want to put your foot on a leg of the stand to hold it down.  The smooth cone of the K&M offers no such problem - the clarinet lifts right off.	1
The heavy metal and plastic construction are heafty enough for confident clarinet resting. Legs fit inside cone for excellent portability!	1
I use this for my (french) horn. It is my second one; the first one sort of walked off at one point, and I liked it enough to get another. It folds up small enough to put in your music bag if you need to. Lightweight and reasonably sturdy.	1
Perfect stand and very simple to use and elegant. Works for both my Classical and my electric guitar. The bass also fits well so go for it. really good piece of equipment. Had it for long and bought this new one because the other one I had was stolen..yeah it is that good..	1
Love this stand for my acoustic, fits perfect. And it is a great combo with the K&M Electric guitar stand, because they are the same width and look perfectly coordinated together.	1
This is a useful, sturdy instrument stand useful for guitars, cellos, or even an odd bass viola da gamba that you might have around the house.  It is solid and holds your instrument steady when you put it down for a while during a performance or practice session.  The rubberized surface grips your instrument securely below and behind, but a tag on the stand indicates that you should not put an instrument with a nitrocellulose finish on the stand for extended storage as it will react with the finish over time.	1
This is a sturdy stand, with the usual trade off of weight versus stability. It folds up flat, but JUST fits into a standard back pack. For the acoustic-electric crowd, the clearance of the bottom of the guitar is such that you'll need a right-angle plug if you want to leave it plugged in at gigs.  You can adjust the stand to be wider or narrower, but I haven't needed or tried that feature.  I'm pleased. It's my first stand, although I've played the guitar for 40 plus years. About time!	1
I wish I could report that this guy solved all of my ails with 60 cycle AC hum, but unfortunately it does, and it does not.  When engaged, it definitely kills the hum, but there are still a few transients that get past what it gates out. It turns loud AC hum into a light sparkle, for lack of a better way to put it.  That I could deal with, but what I can live with is the fact that it is NOT transparent in the signal chain. There's a definite loss of boost when engaged, and on top of that (and the most unfortunate) is when the gate closes there is a very harsh, electrical sound as the pedal engages. To describe it better - if you're playing something using a high gain amplifier, and you have a rhythm section that has a stop in it (where the guitar volume is still up, but you mute the strings) there's a definite sound as the pedal plays catch-up between the ("good") noise generated by the guitar preamp and the pedal trying to lop off the "bad" noise. As another reviewer said, it definitely sounds similar to a cheap reverb.  If you're just jamming with friends and want to kill the AC noise when you're not playing, this will do the job. But unfortunately, anything you record using one of these inline is going to take a lot of editing to get it's noise out of the track - you're better off just filtering the AC hum instead.	-1
I'm a big fan of the vintage Jazz Bass sound with single coil pickups but I'm not a fan of noise-cancelling bass pickups.  Noise-cancelling are nice but you tend to lose all the character and chatter that makes a bass sound unique and interesting imho.  The down side to that is I eventually end up in places where my pickups are roping in some electrical hum, and sometimes enough to be a show stopper.  This product does exactly what it says it does.  There are a bunch of demonstration videos on YouTube and whatnot.  I recommend it as a fix in a live situation.  After listening to it closely I'd never use it in the studio.  It definitely uses some phase canceling and in a critical listening environment it does sound a bit unnatural.  Honestly, in a live situation a little bit of phase canceling isn't going to be that noticeable - and definitely not as noticeable as the amount of hum and noise this thing gets rid of.  This is staying on my pedal board as a safety net and it's worth every penny to me so I can keep my tone.  Very happy with it!	1
I use vintage 1950's and 1960's single coil pickup guitars when I play out with my band. For years I have been plagued with bad hum problems when the club has bad wiring (most of them do). I was hesitant to buy this because of mixed reviews online. However, I recently played a gig in a club where I had an AWFUL hum, and I had to take a chance on it ASAP. I have used the Hum Debugger in a gig situation and I am happy to report that the product works. Please note: this product DOES change the sound slightly by removing the harmonics from the hum content. The "normal" switch removes only the "odd" harmonics-"strong" switch removes "odd" harmonics AND "even" harmonics. (Not truly sure what these terms mean, but I can hear the difference.) What does your guitar sound like with this device? On normal, it sounds pretty close to regular-you may notice the missing harmonics just a bit if you compare the on signal to the off signal. There may still be a very slight hum. On the strong setting if you compare closely the on & off signals you will notice a drop in volume and the sound will sound a bit "stripped" of tone and-to my ears-just a little bit wobbly. When I played my gig, I opted for the "normal" setting, with just a tiny bit of hum audible (actually, I was quieter than my band's other guitar player), but with the better guitar tone and was very happy. In the future, I will take the Hum Debugger to all my gigs, and use it as needed. Do you need a Hum Debugger? If you use vintage single-coil pickup guitars and have experienced highly embarrassing hum at your shows, I think that you do.	1
This product does exactly what it says. I cannot play my Telecaster or my single-coil Pedal Steel without it. I was concerned about the possibility that this device would alter the sound of my guitar. Having used it extensively I can now say that there is no noticeable effect other than the complete absence of hum. On a Pedal Steel, where you have very close control over pitch by moving the bar, if you are very careful you can find places between notes where the tone is completely notched out. During normal playing this is not noticeable at all. I would say there is a subtle difference in the perceived sound of a guitar with AC hum underneath and without. I'll take the "without" sound any day.  Two wishes for follow-ons to this product: I wish it came in a "B size" or smaller enclosure, and I wish that it could be operated from a 9VDC power source rather than the AC one.	1
Here's the problem - I don't actually know if it works, so I can't say how well (or how poorly) it does what it's supposed to do.  Amazon sells this unit without a power supply, and suggests on its site that a planet waves 9 volt external charger will work.  Well, the unit requires a 7.5 volt, 200mA charger.  So not only do I have an extra power supply (which I can use with another pedal, fortunately), I need a power supply.  When contacting Electro-Harmonix, they say they sell the item WITH a power supply.  How Amazon is selling it without an item included by the manufacturer is odd, to say the least.  EH was good enough to point me to a source for a genuine, compatible power supply since there's no apparent way (short of returning it) to get Amazon to provide it.  Once that unit arrives I hope to have better things to say.  Till then, if you are sure you are getting it with the correct power supply I have no reason to doubt it will work as intended.	-1
At our first gig at a new venue where the stage is in front of a gigantic neon sign, I had to abandon my '51 Precision Bass w/ single coil p-up due to the worst 60-Hz hum ever heard. That inspired me to take the plunge and try the Hum Debugger. Back at the next gig, I kicked it on and... complete silence. A must for gigging musicians.	1
Great product if you have a nasty hum problem that can't be fixed any other way.  There is no other product on the market that does what this does!  Others have commented on how this changes their tone, I did not notice this on clean and medium gain playing with a telecaster.  Wish it worked on a 9VDC standard power adapter, but what other option do I have?  For reference I play a MIM telecaster with vintage style pickups that really pick up nasty hum from light dimmers in large church sanctuary.  I tried lots of other solutions including power line filters, ground loop isolators, ferrite clamps, and nothing else worked.  I will eventually be better shielding the guitar and switching to noiseless pickups, but this is a life saver in the mean time!	1
I used it to play in an environment with a lot of EMI and it worked great. Even when I turned it up to the "strong" setting, I didn't notice any metallic or robotic sounds as some other reviewers have mentioned. It was placed dead first in my signal chain. Sure, it's a one-trick pony, but if you're in a place where that trick is needed, it's invaluable.	1
Arrived on time and works great!	1
Crap.  Someone else mentioned that it leaves your tone sounding like R2D2.  This is 100% true, especially if you want to solo.  Each note sounds like binary bits & bytes.  Takes beautiful analog tone and makes it sounds like a cheap Star Wars sound effects flick.  Nice idea, but total waste of money.	-1
Plugged the guitar with noisy P90 pickups directly into this box, before pedalboard - shutdown 90% of the nasty hum - does it change the tone of the guitar? yes just a bit, but unless you are recording, I don't think anyone can detect it playing live. I almost spent $350 for noiseless pickups. Bought this slightly used for $50 - worked out great!	1
I prefer to only review great products (mom taught me if you can't say something good, don't say it).  That said, this product is great . . .it was able to eliminate hum from my Godin Kingpin 1 (P90 single coil pickup) with really no noticeable impact on fidelity. This pedal is not a noise gate, my guess is it leverages some type of 60 cycle phase inversion technology. It really does its job of removing 60 cycle hum and associated harmonics with minimal, if any, impact on tone.  Essential product if you use single coil pickups and don't like the hum.	1
I own one, I like it and will keep it, but there are things you should know. It may not be a noise gate, but it behaves like one. When you stop playing, it can be heard quickly adapting to the changing signal. It does not entirely remove all hums and buzzes, but it does get rid of 99 percent of them. And what is there is much, much quieter. Also, the power supply (included) is recommended as the only way to power it (using as it does less than 9v), so no 1 spots will do. This last is a hassle, but worth it. I play strats and teles, and it works like a charm with them, but it doesn't render them utterly silent. (I've encountered humbuckers that were noisy as heck, and this would doubtless help them too.) Also, the high setting on the Debugger can create some slight, metallic delay pedal-like sounds, but they are very subtle and not to be feared. The normal setting will likely be your choice, as it is mine. Just remember that it's basically a 'smart processor' that is reacting on the fly to your signal, and the tiny flaws in performance will not bother you. Note: put it first in your signal chain! Best for: noisy, buzzy pickups.	1
I have a Telecaster with single coil pickups played through a Fender tube amp under fluorescent lights. Tons of hum. Decided to give this Hum Debugger a try instead of a Boss NS-2. Plugged my Tele into it,and with the switch on "Normal", no change. Hum still there. Put the switch on "Strong" and voila, the hum was gone. I mean 100% and no change in the tone.  This product is as simple as it gets and it works.	1
I ordered this because my peavey vypyr tube 60 was making an ungodly loud  noise of humming and buzzing. I plugged my guitar into the hum debugger, then ran a cord from the hum debugger to my amp and when I stepped on the switch... DEAD SILENCE!!!!  Yes it does steal some of your tone, but I don't think its an astronomical amount that changes your sound completely, especially if you're playing with a full band with drums, bass and other guitar player you will hardly notice it and the audience isn't going to notice it, so I don't think its a big deal. You will notice it more if your just jamming by yourself with your guitar and amp. I am very happy with this because it does exactly what it says.	1
I've tried this in two different pedal boards in multiple locations and it just doesn't work for me.  Not one little bit.  I may have a problem in the power beyond what this can fix, but in one situation, it actually magnified the hum.  I guess I'll go back to my noise reduction pedal.  I was so hopeful that the Hum Debugger would be what it promised to be.  The way they described the design, it sounded like it would work better and be less intrusive than my noise reduction pedals.  I was seeking a better solution, but the Hum Debugger is not it.	-1
I like the stand, it's a bit lightweight but works great for what I'm doing with it. The weight and how well it folds up are very convenient since I'm traveling with it.	1
It holds the stand. Seems reasonably heavy duty, spent a month in europe with it and nothing bad happened. Never tried toting by the strap so i can't help there. I'd certainly buy another if i needed one.	1
This bag is a perfect fit for my K&M music stand.  Sturdy fabric & stitching--this bag will probably outlive me!	1
Great carrying case for K&M Music Stand.	1
Quality bag.  Easy to handle.  I like the green trim which distinguishes it from similar bags.  No problems with it.	1
Our band buys a lot of K & M gear because it is not only well-built, it is OVER-built, meaning, it stands up to the daily rigors of constant use and travel. We love their mic stands, we love their music stands, we love their hardware in general.  The same can NOT be said for this bag. It is junk. The seams come apart almost right away. I have sewn this thing back together more times than you can imagine? Why? Because I paid for this bag and, gosh-darn-it, I'm gonna get my money's worth out of it.  Honestly, in about a half an hour you could make a bag this crummy, and then you would have had the pleasure of hand-crafting something cool, that you could decorate and bedazzle however you want. In an hour you could sew a vastly superior bag to this one, which you still could decorate and bedazzle and have the pleasure of having hand-crafted something neat. Why am I wasting my time on this review? I should be making myself a new bag. Sheesh.	-1
It's the original bag for the stand so it does fit fine.  We don't really fold up and pack the stand much at all so we haven't use the bag much but it's nice to have so the stand doesn't get beat up or scratched.	1
I already had the music stand...I simply needed the case and this case was made for the stand I had purchased at a local music store.	1
Very Heavy Duty, Very High Quality.  Only draw back is this is not a good gig bag cable.  Very Heavy Very Thick.  I love this cable.	1
Vox cable.. ARE AWESOME!	1
i bought a white one 9 years ago and still love it and use it today, great shielding no noise and it looks killer and doesnt tangle and the right angle connector is low profile and doesnt get in the way even when plugged into strats its the perfect cable and has been used a lot and still works like the day i got it. great for bedrooms and small spaces too, it seemed expensive at the time but the cable was very cheap considering how long ive had it, high quality and rugged build quality the white is more dirty now and the gold has largely scratched off the connectors but still works like new even after all the abuse its been through. my go to cable	1
I've had two of these. The first lasted a little over a year, and the second only 4 months. Problem seems to be the straight plug end, but it's so sealed up, you can't check the soldered contacts. I'm meticulously careful with my gear. I'm done with Vox cables.	-1
looks good, sounds good. a bit short but its great. not sure if the sound quality is better, but it sounds on point.	1
It works, but it's a tone suck because its longer than 18.5 feet and maybe other internal factors. I wasn't happy with the muddy sound that I got out of my favorite guitar. Then after finding some research suggesting to try different cables with low resistance to my Vox amp. I bought a Fender and a Donner cable. My guitar sounds much better with those cables than this one. I wish I could return it now.	-1
Very good!	1
Great cord!!  Very convenient and movable!!  Love it!!	1
These are good leads; they work well and I have no complaints.	1
nice chord	1
Fun red coiley cord. I cart it around in my gear bag to jams every week, seems to be holding up really well. No good if you are a ways away from your amp though - it's just not that long, being a coiley thing. Great for the studio room we jam in, which is a bit tight on space.	1
Fast shipping. Heavy duty, no audio issues, best cable I own. Seriously!	1
Heavy duty with a vintage vibe!	1
Solid connection, zero issues so far with heavy gigging.	1
Very solid cable, great length, just what I was looking for.	1
Good quality but the color is a little misleading, it's actually a pink red. Just bought the white one.	1
Great retor coil cable	1
Tone is perfect and it looks oh so cool on my Fender Jag. The only thing is be careful if you don't like pink, because the "red" color is really just pink. Although, I like how light the color looks.	1
This just the most badass cable out there.  The curls make your guitar squeal like a little piggy!	1
the red is the best	1
More than enough cable for the stage or even gigging. You would not be disappointed. Made very sturdy and has a glossy finish. Input jack to guitar is designed at a right angle, so the chance that the chord gets pulled out accidentally is rather remote than if it was made with a straight input instead.	1
I've used this cord in a live setting for about a year. Its very sturdy and feels like it's well made. A couple of complaints that caused me to knock off a star:  1. It's really heavy. When I play it feels a little like I'm fighting the cord because it's pulling down on my guitar.  2. It definitely looks red in the pictures, but is much more pink than I wanted it to be.  If you want one of these vintage style cords, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it but I'd probably say to go with black.	1
This is a heavy duty cable. I really like the vintage look of coiled cables, and since I use a VOX amp I figured I'd buy these. The 29.5 feet cable is a bit misleading, its actual length is about half that because it's coiled. The cable doesn't touch the ground as much as a regular cable, which is a good thing because it doesn't get as dirty and avoids possible interference. In fact, there has been absolutely no interference since I started using this cable. These VOX cables are a quite a bit more expensive than most other coiled cables, even if they are longer in length. I think the reason for that is because of how heavy they are, they have a very thick PVC jacket. On the package, it says the cable consists of: PVC jacket, spiral shield, conductive PVC shield, polypropylene insulation, treble conductors, and bass conductor. One end of the cable is straight, the other is a right angle. If you can spend the extra money, I definitely recommend one of these because they will last a very long time.	1
I thought it would be red but it's more pink.  I had some explainin' to do when I started using it.  If you need a coiled cord, the Vox is probably the best one to get.  But stick with manly black.	1
Awesome but like many others said, kinda heavy. Heavy, like, you're concerned that the weight is pulling on your guitar jack too hard.  Ya know?  No bid deal though.  The carry-bag is really nice too.  Vox!	1
Best Cable ever! With this high of build quality I wouldn't be surprised if these are 30 year old cords being resold. They're not they're new with Mesh Carry Bag. Your clients/Fans will comment on these.	1
I love it!	1
I love these old school coiled cables. The quality of build is beyond any guitar cable I've ever bought and I've had a few. Even the fender braided cables are nothing compared to this. The plugs are super heavy duty and I feel like they will last for a long time. Additionally the bag it comes with is a nice addition so it doesn't get caught up in my other cables.	1
Hard to find at big box music stores great for home  studio and can stretch and recoil a great distance  no negative noise etc excellent heavy duty cord	1
This is a great guitar cable! Rugged, and totally worth the money! Do not worry about buying this cord, because you will not be disappointed! I hope to buy more in the future, though through my local Guitar Center as Amazon pricing does not vary in pricing at the time I purchased my cord. GC will have it in stock. BUY LOCAL!	1
I don't think I'll ever use anything but vox cables for my guitar again! The quality is amazing. It is a bit short, But that's the only flaw it has. Love vox.	1
This is a great guitar cable..  really all that needs to be said.  very quiet (no hum or buzz) & heavy duty.  does the job and looks great too.	1
While shopping for a new cable, I noticed one reviewer state that a cable is a cable, implying that the cheaper cables were just as good. I chose the Vox from Gear Nuts, and found that the statement couldn't be farther from the truth. I'm playing a Fender American Deluxe Plus.. My amp is a Fender Mustang IV. I noticed a significant difference in tone and clarity with my Vox cable. I'm sold on the quality of Vox. It is worth every penny I spent over less expensive brands. UPDATE: I ordered my second VOX cable. The first is performing fine. a year later. I got the second for my Ovation Balladeer. I play it through an Alessis Coolfire acoustic amp. The tone is excellent. I still believe VOX cables are well worth the cost.	1
I've learned the hard way so many times that you get what you pay for. These cables are well worth the purchase.	1
Love the retro curly cable look and this one is high quality, too.  It's pretty low capacitance and doesn't throw a blanket over my tone.  It compares well to other high quality cables I have (Lava and Elixir)  The Vox cable DOES attenuate the high frequencies a tiny bit compared to my Elixir cables but in a pleasing way (the Elixir has CRAZY low capacitance, though.  But I don't think they make them any more and prices have gone the opposite of crazy low. I digress.)  I've only had it a couple weeks so I can't speak to reliability but the plugs look sturdy.  The right-angle plug is molded on and the straight plugs innards are encased in plastic.  This is probably reliable but you'd have to cut them off if they ever failed and solder on new ones.  The coil does function as a strain-relief; it helps prevent yanking out a plug.  You don't have to loop it through your guitar strap anymore (old habits die hard, though.)  I like the drawstring mesh bag that it comes with.  Never bought a cable that came with candy before!  Random comments: - Don't expect it to stretch to 30 feet.  While I'm sure there actually are 30 feet of cable, it's a tight coil and will definitely start dragging your pedal-board behind you (or knock your amp over) after about 15 feet or so.  - I bought the "silver" version but the cable jacket isn't really silver.  It's actually clear (well, ever so slightly yellow); you simply see the silver sleeve/ground wire strands through the clear jacket so . . . well . . . it looks silver from more than a few feet away.  I'm pretty sure the other colors have an opaque jacket.  Whatevs.  Overall, it's definitely worth a try if you're looking for a coily.	1
This cable is really good!! It's heavy duty and it looks very nice too!! There is no noise and the plugs are really good quality. The cable is thick and it is for sure better than cheaper ones... This was test cable purchase ever!! Worth the extra bucks!	1
Mine stopped working after 1 week. Then I bought a $9.99 coil cord on Amazon again and I've had that for 2 years now. Spend no more than $15 on guitar cords. They are the same.	-1
I had a coiled guitar cable years ago but never liked it, I was turned off of them because of extremely poor performance compared to straight. I need length and portability so after reading the reviews, took the plunge. They're not cheap but upon close inspection are well worth $30. I have compared the sound quality to a 10ft Fender Pro and amazingly, it beats it hands down. If I "lost" it, I would buy another. I would even consider giving one to a discerning musical friend. *********************************************** ***********************************************   Some 6 months later, suddenly started to get cutouts, found cable was intermittently open. Tried replacing jacks but still was open in other areas of the cable. This with only using in apt at no more than 10 ft length. Too bad... a waste of $30.	-1
Great cable. Has plenty of give so I don't feel like I'm going to topple anything if I walk somewhere on stage.	1
This cable is awesome but I don't want you to buy it because I don't want too many people to rock this cable out. Oh Billy!	1
Great looking cord, took a bit of wiggling around to get it to work in the first place. After 6 months, it stopped working. I don't know what to do with it since having it repaired might cost as much as buying a new one.	-1
I think these are the best coil cables.  I have coiled bullet cables and coiled Fender cables, and Vox just beats them all.  A little lighter than the heavy bullets, but it's built well.  Also I crunched a plug at one point, and vox honored the lifetime warranty.  I would highly recommend.	1
Very heavy duty.  The coils keep me from getting tangled.  I think this will last a very, very long time. I personally think it's better quality than my Mogami gold.  It's definitely more heave duty feeling and priced a lot better.	1
I decided to replace a couple of my old, unreliable, inexpensive guitar cables with what appeared to be better quality retro-style cables, largely by including them on a birthday list.  I opted for this Vox coiled cable and the Spectraflex Original Series braided tweed cable.  Both are more expensive than the cheapies, and both clearly perform better.  As I mentioned in my review of the Spectraflex cable, it completely eliminates the crackles and pops that come from poor connections to the instrument.  The Vox cable is not quite as consistent, and is more expensive.  The problem is that, because of its coiled nature, it doesn't sit on the floor.  Other reviewers have noted that this presents some advantages; however, it should be noted that this attribute also means that every time the player moves, the cable moves around at the guitar.  Ultimately, it probably means that you can't move around a whole lot while playing and, more importantly, that you need to limit yourself in how you are positioned with respect to the amplifier.  The Vox is a heavy duty cable, although it is a little disappointing that such a major name in U.K. electronics has their products made in China (the Spectraflex is American made).  This cable has that classic vintage look and probably is superior to the cables of the 1960s. I think that I will use it primarily at home, however, because of the limitations it poses.  If you like the look, and get a cable that is plenty long, it seems like a worthwhile investment; however, if you are debating between this and the retro cables of Spectraflex, save some money, get more flexibility, and buy the Spectraflex.	1
Want to learn how to play your favorite guitar parts from your favorite songs? Need to learn a part for a gig? Need a gig? This thing practically puts your fingers where they need to be. I love this device. I've owned and used a number of Teac guitar and Bass trainers, and this one ROCKS. Read the features, and I guarantee you'll love it. It's a blast to play along with , and the array of effects is awesome. Trust me - BUY ONE.	1
I'll start by saying I own a few larger pedal boards from different companies.  The velcro that covers the board in this case (soft side) is much better quality than on my $200 SKB case in that it does permanently pull loose.  I got this case to replace my wife's Boss BCB-30 pedal board which limited her to three boss-sized pedals.  This thing is roughly the same dimensions and has space for several more toys.  I would consider this case to be an above average medium grade.  While sturdy enough for almost any situation, It may not hold up to something like a large truck driving over it.  However, for the price and quality, I haven't seen a better hard-shell pedal board.	1
Small. But that's why I chose it.	1
I have it pretty stuffed with 3 standard size stomp boxes, line 6 wireless receiver, and power strip. If you worked it right and got rid of power strip, could probably fit more.	1
Very nice.  I use it for bass effects.	1
This is a nice case for the money. The hinges were kind of bent right out of the box, but they seem to be working ok. I don't gig out heavily with this case anyhow. The case itself is not very firm which leads me to believe that stepping on stompboxes would cause some bending and warping over time. I chose to put a Boss BCB-3 with all of my main pedals inside of the case as sort of inner board and use the case as a shell more or less. The BCB-3 fits just fine minus the lid. Try 3m Command Strips instead of velcro.	1
Nice and Small ergonomic case.  I bought it for my 5 pedals in my bass rig.  The construction on the outside looks very clean and appealing.  My 40 pound daughter jumped up and down on it while I was not looking and it had no dents or scratches.  I really love the handle, its sturdy like the handle on my bass case.  The velcro it came with is lacking a bit but the soft velcro on the bottom is perfect.  I love its small footprint and professional look.  would definitely buy again, perhaps one of its bigger brothers.  FYI interior dimensions is roughly 17" x 9" to those who plan ahead like I do.	1
A great little pedal case. I also have the larger model. It really does the job and I received it promptly. What more can you ask for?	1
good size for a limited pedal set, great for me as I use a lot of 'nano' pedals. The supplied velcro is junk...the adhesive doesn't stick to the back of the velcro!!	1
price cheap.	1
Not entirely rugged, but don't kid yourself, unless you're going on a world tour, it's gonna work for years.	1
Piece of junk. Looks nice but the lid is a huge pain to attach. Plug the velco lining isn't well glued to the bottom and it will come apart if you try to remove one of your pedals. Don't waste you money on this. Get a better pedal case.	-1
I bought this to use as a 3 or 4 place pedalboard for our side acoustic thing. Nothing complicated. I'll say it is kinda cheaply made. I have pro gear for my band but this case is flimsy. I see the ears/slots that connect the top to the bottom part bending and eventually breaking. Also it's a pain to quickly line up the 2 halves and close and latch it.  The plus is the Velcro is included and it's really light. It does its job but if you're gonna beat it up on the road get something better. Since this is a 4 gig a month side project I'll be careful. But if I could order again I'd get better. Def not the 10 space or so gator case I use for the band.	-1
So far it's exactly what I needed.	1
Nice case for the money but CAUTION!!!!  DO NOT USE THE SUPPLIED VELCRO TAPE.  One you stick it on a pedal it is there forever. Bonds to metal.  I found out about this the hard way. Use a different brand of tape.	1
Let's be honest... this is a great case, for the price.  Consider, the price is VERY cheap.  It is very basic, and will need some fine tuning on your part to make it right. It comes with a velcro side, and a long strip of decent quality velrco tape for holding pedals, cables, etc. in place (3M tape, quality stuff).  The other side is lightly bedded with impact-resist foam.  For me (Fishman ToneDEQ DI, Boss RC-30 loop) the size is more than, fine, and could accomodarte more.  Plan on needing to have your pedals velcro taped independently, and using a fill-in bracer if desired (I chose to use a couple of the airbags and packing roll form amazon pagkaces in it).  It DOES lock, but obviously, for eye-view use (you can see someone unlocking it, but it can be broken open fairly easily, if not watching).  It's decent sturdy, but not 'guaranteed' air-ready, just imo.  4 stars, though - a great product, for the price, and versatile, upon your adjustment.	1
I added foam to the interior and larger feet on the bottom. It's good now.	1
Exactly what I needed -- just the perfect size.  Solidly built, too.  I like it!	1
Not as big as I thought, but that's my fault. Good for small setups.	1
nice case	1
A+	1
This is a really nice case. Beautifully made. It has large feet on the lower half for floor placement. Great size to fill with mini pedals.	1
Perfect.	1
I use this for small gigs,great little case.	1
Lovely case, very nice if you are like me and only use tops 5 pedals [I use the big boutique ones, quality over quantity man, if you need a noise suppressor your doing it wrong and that 3k Mesa you bought sounds like a $800 crate cause your sucking the tone from all those crap BOSS pedals] but if you are a pedal fiend [and really stop man, delay, chorus, compression, a OD, maybe a wah that's all you need] then keep it moving.	1
Works great. I got 5 pedals in it.	1
the title is misleading but never the less I've enjoyed this pedalboard case.  Can't beat the convenience and portability of the design works great with my pedal setup. strongly recommend this product.	1
Nice and simple box. for the price I can not complain. It only hold about 4 standard boss sized foot peddles so be aware that you may grow out of it quickly if you are collecting peddles to add to your effect regiment.	1
It's fine for what it is.  It will not fit my Ernie Ball Jr. Volume Pedal.  Otherwise, it's perfect for a small pedal board.	1
This is a nice portable pedal baord that will house about five Boss style pedals or the equivalent. However a Vox Wah or a Crybaby probably won't fit. My Vox doesnt. Which is kinda  sad coz I wanted everything in one place. Note that this isn't a road case quality hard case. Its made of softer metarial but its light and sturdy enough for club gigs. Its just perfect for that stuff. Comes with keys so you can lock it up as well. Thats always handy. xD Overall well worth it.	1
I have a Strymon Timeline, Boss Tunner and Reverb. All three fit perfectly in my set up. I have enough space in the box to fit my one-spot power supply and my strymon power supply too. Great product for the price.  I wouldn't throw this case around, its a carrying case with some protection but its not a case to toss across the room if you're wondering how tough it is.	1
Nice inexpensive case.  This thing is not the sturdiest thing, but it is very nice. Holds pedals well. The vecro it comes with sucks. The sticky peals off of the strip so your left with the pedal having the clear gooey sticky stuff and the board holding the velco. Have other velcro ready  so you can set up the board when you get it.   Its not for the road. I am a full timer so I use it alot but, I mostly place this board myself. I would not leave it to the crew. I would not bring this setup on a plane either. Its for your hands only and it will be fine. No one takes care of your stuff better than you. The handle is strong and will hold up forever. the hinges are a little weak so be careful where you leave the top and putting it on and off. Once on I don't think I would ever have a problem.. Despite the weak feel. I still like it. You'll see for the price it's very useful.	1
i like that is small and has a small footprint. Is just what i need and it is very well made. Loving it!	1
It was a great idea, and I would love it if it worked. Unfortunately, the joints on the arms supporting the guitar became loose after a few months of use, and now they will not stay in place...leading the guitar to be easily knocked over, as well as needing to constantly be swing back into place before putting the guitar back on the stand. For the price of the stand, as well as the price of the guitar I'm placing on it, I expect more longevity than a few months.	-1
Great product. Very sturdy and well made.	1
I love this little stand. It works really great and very sturdy for its size.	1
There were some problems with this instrument. There is a weird lump on the ribs near the neck. I think it is because of poor sanding, but I could be wrong. It is not extremely noticeable when viewed, but you can feel it very well. The fingerboard wasn't completely done correctly. There are some weird machining marks near the edge. The bridge wasn't in the correct place when it arrived. I had to loosen the strings and fix it. There is a slight problem with the finish near the ribs on the top plate, but it took me until today to notice it. There are some weird black spots on the underside of the fiddlehead under the finish, but I have no clue what they are. There was a sandy buzzing sound when I first tried to play it. This was remedied by removing the plastic bridge protectors on all the strings besides the e. The case attracts dust like no tomorrow and doesn't seem too durable. I had to replace the chinrest with a different one that I had laying around because I didn't consider what was on this one. The bow had a scratch on the frog. The tailpiece is plastic. Everything else is real ebony. The action was a bit high on arrival.  However, the tuners were done well. I have no problems with those. The sound is adequate. It is what you would expect. The reason this has the rating it does is mostly because the sound and functionality. It works and does as you'd expect. It looks like it does in the photo, minus this imperfections mentioned.  Buy at the lower price. The price on these instruments fluctuates a lot on amazon. You shouldn't spend more than 200 on this this. There are times when it will spike up to 250.	1
Thanks++++	1
This is an instrument that I purchased to replace a Mendini MV300 for my oldest.  The Mendini really required a lot of love to get it in shape to play, and though we got two years out of it, the instrument really started holding him back.  Frankly, if I had it to do all over again (even not knowing if he'd like the violin or not...) I'd have gone with this rig.  If you're here, it's probably either because the school year has started and it's time to find an instrument for your son or daughter, or perhaps you're looking to learn the violin yourself.  I found buying to be more attractive than renting for various reasons.  But we aren't here to talk about instrument economics.  We're here to talk about the Cremona SV-175, which in my mind is an ideal beginner or novice level instrument.  Further, with enough love, this instrument will likely carry the student through the intermediate level.  It's really quite good.  First though, is the obligatory word of caution:  this is NOT a professional-level instrument.  If you approach the instrument on those terms, you will be disappointed.  It's not fair to judge by those criteria, particularly since Cremona is not selling this as a masterwork.  No, this is a student violin, well made but nonetheless intended for students.  It will not get in the way of the student trying to learn, nor will it encourage bad habits.  Now typically, I shy away from buying complete all-in-one, accessory-laden packages.  In the music world, while price doesn't always equal quality, there is a point where that doesn't really hold true.  If you're buying a ginormous outfit at about the same price as a violin + bow from another maker, then you have fewer dollars going into the actual violin...and it will show.  You want your money to go to instrument quality, which means good tonewoods like solid spruce and maple, ebony fittings like the pegs and fingerboard, and good craftsmanship and setup.  The Cremona offers you that, at a pretty good price point.  I had absolutely no problems receiving this via mail.  The instrument was well-nestled in its case and packed/padded enough to prevent damage.  Moreover, it looked as though someone actually did setup on this instrument (more on setup in a minute)...the bridge fits, the pegs fit, the soundpost was in place...so really, all I needed to do was tune it up, rosin the bow, and I was in business.  As these were new strings (D'Addario Preludes), certainly they required a few days of constant tuning until they settled down, but settle down they did and the results are fantastic.  Again, in this context, this is a very good instrument, especially after some time of regular playing to get it to open up.  The tone is marvelous and certainly belies the pedigree of the instrument.  It sounds great.  However, this isn't to say you have nothing to do here.  When receiving this or any other violin in this manner, PLEASE spend some time looking at the setup and take it to a professional luthier when you get a chance.  It's a small investment but will pay dividends down the road.  In particular, consider:  -The peg box.  If pegs are either slipping or are overly hard to turn (and I mean really hard) then either the pegs or the peg box holes are the wrong size/shape.  The pegs should be conical and the ends should be flush with the peg box hole on the opposite side.  If not, they may need to be reshaped.  A lutheir can help with this.  -The soundpost.  This should NOT be glued into place, instead wedged inside the instrument.  It should also be in a very particular place...if it's misplaced, the violin will sound flat or muted.  Soundpost placement requires some specialized tools and knowledge, best left to a luthier.  -The bridge.  If you're handy with wood, you can probably do this yourself.  Mainly you want the bridge to be standing straight up and perpendicular to the top of the violin.  If it's leaning to or fro then that tells you it's in the wrong spot (it should be even with the little notches in the F holes) and the strings are too tight or too loose against the bridge.  In addition, the feet need to be flush with the violin top with 100% contact, and that means they need to be cut so as to accommodate the curvature of the top.  It may take a little fussing, but a properly-placed bridge makes a huge difference.  it more efficiently transmits the vibrations of the strings to the body of the instrument.  -The strings.  I like the Prelude strings these come with, finding them to have a nice bright tone.  They are steel core, so they will be lacking a certain warmth.  So that said, I typically gravitate toward synthetic core strings, like Dominants (although D'Addario has the Pro-Arte line that are nylon core which I like very much as well).  Strings are not a trivial purchase, so resist the urge to scrimp here...I think they are the component that has the single biggest impact on the overall sound of the instrument.  Again, note and note well that new strings always require a breaking in period and will stretch over the course of days before settling down.  You'll need to retune very regularly until they do.  That isn't to say that there aren't *some* compromises here.  The bow is functional and actually pretty good for a starter outfit, but it's not something that's going to last for the long haul.  The case, on the other hand, is simply fantastic...it's sturdy with a nice big compartment inside to hold accessories like extra strings, rosin, a tuner, etc.  So to conclude (and I'm sorry this review is stretching on so long):  I found this to be a simply fantastic instrument for the student, quite probably one of the best offered.  And I say that knowing full well that it's made in China - but it's made with care and attention and craftsmanship, so that pedigree doesn't bother me one bit.  This isn't a hastily-made, mass produced Violin Shaped Object.  Varnish is appropriately applied and the instrument overall does not have any chips, cracks, loose joints, etc.  The tone and playability are right on, so much so that this will encourage the student to learn and learn properly.  It's simply a very good violin.	1
But they're the best I've ever played on. I've tried Slinky, D'Addario, Blue Steel, Elixir, Boomers, and DR...and I honestly feel that Rotos just blow them away. They feel comfortable, last quite a while, and the price is right where it should be. Obviously, string feel under the fingers is a very subjective thing and guitar players are notoriously picky folk. So understandably, your take may differ. In any case, I'd recommend at least giving them a shot and seeing if these strings don't become a regular for you. Just keep in mind that the gauge on this one is a hybrid light top/heavy bottom, so you may need a slight adjustment to your setup.	1
These instruments are poorly constructed, have low quality parts on them and in general are just trouble right out of the box.  I Have seen a number of these violins and the bridges are poorly fit, the varnish is too heavily applied, the strings are low quality, the pegs are poorly fit and are made from low quality material and don't even get me started on the bows quality. On two of the instruments the pegs needed to be completely replaced as did the bows. The others needed the pegs refit.  On all of them the bridge needed work and the strings needed to be replaced. It typically costs another $100-150 just to make them not hinder the person trying to learn. If you are going to have to spend $350-400 anyway, get a better violin that will also sound better.	-1
I've been playing for a long time (and lately been building) and have a lot of violins.  I got this as a gift for a friend (it ended up coming back to me).  This is a decent factory fiddle, and actually sounds alright.  Mine is 4/4 though.  Set up was excellent out of the box (I flatened the bridge a little, and put on helicore strings as I use this for cross tuned old time a lot).  This is my main camp fire fiddle, and sounds surprisingly decent.  Although I feel a beginner should just go to a violin specific shop, and drop $150, which is more than what you pay on the internet, at least you start a relationship with someone who can do set up, and the pegs won't slip, the bridge will be set correctly, and you will have someone who will answer questions and reset the sound post when the violin gets dropped.  However (remember, mine is 4/4), this is a decent beginner fiddle, and probably a little better that what you will get for $150 at a violin shop.  The actual carving is real rough, scroll, nut, etc, but the things sound pretty decent.  The tail piece is ok, though not as smooth as a whitner, and the chin rest is nice.  Summary, sounds good (more mellow, not too loud or bright, good for beginners - actual workmanship and wood used is low/rough/machine made, but even still, set up out of the box was right on the money - plays and sounds good).	1
This stand is durable enough to hold small music books, and has bars that swing in, to hold a book open to the page you want. It will not safely hold a large book. It feels pretty solid and durable, and folds up compactly for transport. It is not as heavy as some others, but a good value for the money.	1
This light but sturdy stand is just what my daughter needed.  I would buy it again if I need one.  It had a great price and fast shipping.	1
It's a good music stand. Easy to fold and unfold.	1
My sons enjoy their music stands that I got for at-home practice.  Wish they didn't tip-over so easily, but anything you can fold-up is going to have some of that.  Good purchase overall.	1
My son loves this stand it is easy to set up and easy to carry east to break down. great buy	1
I think writing down a review should be optional. Just like how it used to be. I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day. But now we can't send a rating until we give a review on the product we ordered. I used to only write a review if there was something wrong. I f not, then I give five stars. I don't time to write a review for everything I order so I'll just copy and paste this on every order. MAKE THIS SECTION OPTIONAL. Thank you and have a great day!	1
You'll notice that all but 1 review within the past 2 years are 4/5 stars. Clearly, Stagg (the company) has improved this product.  The stand is very solid (for $15) and the parts move freely and then retain their position after being locked down. The black matte finish is a plus... it doesn't show fingerprints or reflect glare as much as chrome.  It sure beats the  $45 Hamilton stand that I bought 6-months ago which bends just looking at it !	1
Was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews, but ordered one anyway. I was very pleased with the stand, however it appeared somewhat flimsy when I 1st opened the box. After setting it up and making the adjustments I realized any more "beef" built in would only add to the weight, and not make it more sturdy. A great product for my limited home use and would recommend.	1
1st time I ordered this product, it would not extend and only stood about 3 feet tall. luckily I have Amazon Prime and it got replaced quickly (I got a new one within 1 day) but I digress...  This product is shorter than my other inexpensive music stands, it's only about 4 feet tall at its longest extension. It's sturdy enough for my drum playing, my guitar, keyboard etc (but I had to get a different one for my singing, since I have to stand up for my singing practices).  I like that it's lightweight, it's easy to adjust, the heavier/more expensive ones are harder to adjust for me and if those fall, they can hurt. If this one falls on you, you may not even feel a thing, it would be like bamboo reeds. I love it!!!  For a taller, inexpensive music stand, I will order&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hisonic-Signature-Series-7121-Two-Section-Folding-Music-Stand-with-Carrying-Bag/dp/B000BWEM42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hisonic Signature Series 7121 Two Section Folding Music Stand with Carrying Bag</a>&nbsp;again.	1
This is a lightweight stand, which truly doesn't get that tall. good for playing while seated, but that's about it. It was the height described, so i knew what i was getting into. It is rather compact, however it only has one telescopic section,, resulting in a two foot long rather thin package when folded. seems slightly odd. A great deal for the money though	1
Spend a little more money and get a good stand. This one is cheaply made and will not stand up to any but very light use.	-1
I didn't really go around looking for the perfect stand.  This was on amazon, convenient and at a good price.  I bought it.  It is sturdy, functional, nice.  I would definitely recommend it.  I don't know how it compares to other stands but this has perfectly met our needs and has stood the abuse of a 6th grader with grace.  I would definitely buy it again if I needed another one.	1
Product came as described, it's very lightweight even extended to the full 10 feet with a shotgun mic attached. The shipping started out a little slow because it wasn't shipped right away , but it arrived the first day of the estimated arrival date, so no complaints.  UPDATE: After having this boom pole for a few years (2 I think) The gold connector that connects the shock mount to the boom pole has stripped, rendering it useless. I have contacted Rode because I cannot find another connector anywhere online so I am going to see if I can at least purchase just that part instead of another boom pole. I will update after I have the answer.  UPDATE II: I was able to get in touch with RODE and I must say they are one of the BEST companies I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. I asked them about purchasing the connector and they asked for my address and sent a new one for FREE. No shipping, no charge at all. They said 7-10 business days and I had my replacement part in about 4 or 5 which REALLY impressed me. If nothing else get this boom pole just for the excellent quality, affordable price and UNBEATABLE customer service. I will now by a RODE customer for life!!!	1
I like rode stuff because you get more than what you pay for.  This pole would be fine on a pro shoot, and for about 200 less than a comparatively priced pole from a pro company.  Save your money for a good mic, and get this less expensive pole.	1
Online information about this boompole is inadequate, so I thought I would write a quick first impression review.  I just purchased the Rode Mini Boompole as a handy little boom for run and gun audio. It will mainly be used with my new Tascam DR-100 portable digital recorder and external XLR mics, mostly Rode NT-4 stereo and a Sennheiser MKH 40.  My other pole is a Gitzo, but not carbon fiber. So I am working with cheap gear, not the fancier booms that full time production audio guys use.  The Rode Mini Boompole is made from aluminum tubing. It arrived with evidence of residual manufacturing oil. I wiped it down with no bad effects. I'd characterize build quality as better than a lot of indy filmmaker gear, which features a lot of improvisational engineering - dollies made with skateboard wheels and such. Machine work on locking collets is good looking and everything works well. When you disassemble the pole, as I did in an attempt to load a mic cable internally, the machine work in thread cutting is not as polished. But it is completely acceptable in a $100 item that works very well.  The Rode Mini Boompole appears large enough to feed an XLR connector internally, but this turns out not to be the case. The pole's throat is slightly too small, which appears to be a design oversight. Still, the smallest extension on the mic end of the pole is much larger than my Gitzo, which is barely large enough to thread a permanent cable before the XLR connector is affixed.  The Rode Mini Boompole does have machined channels at both ends where a permanent internal cable could be installed if desired. It also comes with velcro straps used to secure a cable externally, which is what I did when mounting my Rode NT-4 stereo mic.  I like the dense open cell hand grip material covering the entire first section of the pole. The rubber end at the base is a bit under engineered, if someone is going to rest the pole end on the ground during breaks in production. Just a flat disk of rubber less than a quarter inch. I would expect something a little more rugged and robust.  So far, I have only used the boompole in a noisy environment (high school football). Even without a suspension mount on the Rode NT-4 stereo mic, I did not notice any handling noise, even though I was listening and testing a bit. Likewise, using the supplied velcro straps to secure the mic cable externally did not seem to cause problems.  My initial reaction about weight was a bit of concern, but this turned out to be no problem, even with the largish Rode NT-4 mounted using an internal 9-volt battery in lieu of phantom power off the recorder.  In general, I enjoyed using this boompole. My application is fairly casual, no long tiresome booming. For quick sound grabbing, this is a nice addition to my kit at very low cost. I'm happy with the purchase, and would recommend it to others.  =====  UPDATE  I've had the boom a couple of years, and I like it better now than when I first got it. Why? Totally new application - running a boom camera. Running a Sony DSC-HX9V attached to the Rode Boom makes for spectacular shots rivaling crazy expensive cranes and jibs. But the entire setup is super lightweight. I bought my HX9V at Amazon.  For this application, I recommend the full length 10' Rode Boom Pole.  A couple of key accessories make this work:  Giottos MH1004-320 Mini Tripod Ball Head. This is a tiny ball head that is all you need to connect the HX9V to the Rode Boom.  The trickier part is monitoring. The HX9V outputs video via HDMI while recording, so monitoring is simply a matter of rigging a monitor to the boom pole.  I have a SmallHD DP6 monitor which I attached to the Rode Boom using a Manfrotto Magic Arm and a Manfrotto Super Clamp. This adds considerable bulk and weight, really too much for extended use and also the bulk really makes it difficult to move through crowds without bumping into people.  However, the spectacular lens and image stabilization of the HX9V make for very compelling video. So much so, I am going to purchase a SmallHD DP4 EVF monitor for this rig. The Manfrotto mounting hardware has to go, however. I was not able to find anything through normal channels, so I started looking through bicycle specialty retailers for handlebar mounts. I've decided on a product called "RAM Mounts Roll Bar Mount Kit." It looks very compact, is sized correctly to grip the Rode Boom Pole with a band, it has two articulated ball joints, and a tripod screw that should be perfect for the SmallHD DP4. Plus, I'm hoping the whole device will be rugged and strong since it is designed for jarring off road mountain biking.  A package of Bongo Ties, available from Amazon, used for cable management of the HDMI cable, completes the package.  Nothing is perfect, and it would be great to have remote control of the HX9V, especially start / stop recording. That's the only major downside of this rig - the fact that you have to haul the camera down to start or stop recording, which adds a bunch of garbage footage to the beginning and end of every shot. Still, I like it.  One other thing to keep an eye on is EV compensation. The HX9V does not have manual exposure control, which may sway some people to choose the NEX-5n or NEX-7, and the camera tends to overexpose 1/3 to 2/3rds of a stop. I spend too much time checking EV compensation while shooting; I need to figure out how to lock down this setting.  FWIW - I actually think the inexpensive HX9V is a better choice for this application than an NEX-5n or NEX-7, which are much more expensive cameras. I plan to buy an NEX-7 soon as it becomes available, but with other applications in mind. Riding the boom pole, the small sensor of the HX9V offers more insurance of sharp focus. Plus the HX9V 1080p 60fps video is spectacular slo mo, apparently the same as the NEX, though I yet have the NEX-7 and have not tested.  The HX9V is spectacular as a pole camera, and also as a handheld steadicam, frankly, another application for which I bought a $12 pistol grip from Amazon. Surprisingly, the audio from the built-in stereo mic is decent also, especially considering the pole cam is frequently used to get in very close quarters shooting where it would not be possible for a cameraman to normally be. One suggestion on audio - add a packet of Rycote Micro Windjammers to your kit to block wind noise. I had to fudge mine about a bit, cutting the adhesive patches to fit the stereo mic on the HX9V, but I think the end result is going to be good, though I have not yet tested outdoors.  One final thing: be sure to get a spare battery or two for the HX9V because this is an addictive way to shoot. The HX9V batteries can only be charged in camera, so you cannot charge while you shoot. Because the camera cannot be remote controlled, I tend to overshoot, and the batteries do not last terribly long. If I were a wedding videographer, I'd take at least 3 batteries to every shoot.	1
Light weight and comfortable to hold. Long enough to do the job. What else can I say?	1
Very easy to work with	1
Just wish it was a smidge longer, but I chose this product for compact and travel, so all in all, great product! You may way a longer one though!	1
Bought this with my Zoom F8 and Rode shotgun mic.  Perfect length and fit.  Everything integrates well!	1
Great pole. Holds the mic well. Though it doesn't allow you to run the cord through the pole as one might think it does.	1
Sturdy and one of the best boom poles I've worked with. Very stable at full length.	1
Great little boom pole. Only needed a small boom and this fits the bill. It's very light and the foam grip makes for comfortable handling.	1
Great inexpensive boom pole and light weight.  Bill Mahon Photo	1
A little noisy when fully extended but not a bad buy for the money.	1
Nice little boom pole for the price. It's not the longest but is lightweight and great for mic'ing a documentary like interview.	1
Fast shipping Great service. Would recommend all the way. Thank you	1
Strong and light weight.  Best bang for your buck boom pole. There are more expensive booms, with more features. For what this is, it does it well.  To note: - Foam handle is comfortable and doesn't seem much wear. - No internal cable routing. (This is a "pro" feature and would not expect that on this product.)  Another use for this is by making it a SUPER SELFIE STICK. Very easy to do. Just add a mini ball head ( http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Mini-Ball-Camera-Mount/dp/B000L47AHG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1426963595&sr=8-2&keywords=mini+ball+head ) and attach a camera.	1
Good Boom pole, before you order be sure you get the adapter to screw on so that you can attach a standard microphone holder.	1
Got this shotgun mic due to its price, wanted something good but not yo expensive. Got it for a small short film, definitely don't regret getting it. I also use it for my canon markiii all the time. The only thing I don't like is how it only records in the left side, sucks when your filming a live event & can't hear from both sides..but you can always double it on post.	1
Just flimsy and cheap...the bolt fell out of the top piece after about 3 shoots.  Save your money on this and buy better quality.	-1
I would have given it five stars except it does not come with an adapter to fit a 5/8" diameter microphone. Maybe I'm missing something but all my mics require that sized adapter.  Otherwise, I am extremely impressed with the build quality, it extends easily and closes easily, and the packaging is great. But to actually use it I have to find an adapter. For a device this well made it should be included, even if that means a couple more bucks. To me, it's like buying a BMW that doesn't come with a spare tire...	1
This is a great lightweight boom pole that works very well.  It folds compactly and extends more than enough for interviews at tradeshows.	1
It has good construction and finish, better than I expected, and I was surprised to come in a package well protected, it is clear that the price indicates a boom pole of introduction, a step ahead of the amateur for not to use household items, ie for people who want to give your video or audio shots better production, I suppose also that its duration will depend on the care taken in handling and adjusting strength sections, which certainly does not need much force or torque to sustain the lengths, plus the fact I was surprised that will not flex with pistol grip and zeppelin heavy, as seen in the photos.  Tiene buena construccion y acabado, mejor de lo que yo esperaba, y me sorprendio que vinieran en un empaque muy protegido; es claro que su precio indica que es una boom pole de introduccin, un paso adelante de lo amateur para no utilizar elementos caseros, es decir para personas que quieren darle a sus video o tomas de sonido una mejor produccin, supongo ademas que su duracion dependera del cuidado que se tenga en su manipulacin y en la fuerza de ajuste en las secciones, que por cierto no necesita gran fuerza ni torque para sustentarlo en la longitud; me sorprendio adems el hecho que no se flexara con un zepelin  y pistol grip pesado, como se observa en las fotos	1
It's cheap, extends a great deal, lightweight, and made by Rode. What else is there to say?  It can seem a little "stiff" and hard to adjust but once you use it a little you get used to it and that's not a problem.	1
7' long boom pole, light and easy to move it around, i have the Rode 10' one and it's a bit heavier than this one, so I rather only use that one for when I have more than a crew with me.	1
It's a solid aluminum boom pole.  I didn't want to spend the money on anything fancier, but this certainly exceeded my expectations in quality of construction and ease of use during 12-hour days.	1
Using this boom on a golf tv series. Works great. Location sound guys using it are impressed. Long and light with padded handle. Great especially for the price. This is pro gear.	1
If you want to sit and play the djembe  this stand is  beautiful and strong  Highly recommended for beginners or pros.	1
Less than twenty dollars shipped to your door for these circum-aural(around the ear)headphones, especially for the sound these produce, is definitely a good buy. They have a detailed and powerful sound even at low volume levels, and decent separation of instruments and vocals so you can hear many little nuances most headphones never reveal (listen intently and you will be pleased!) They are very sensitive so that they are easily driven by a normal mp3 device. They can play lower quality music samples well (pandora etc.) but feed these high fidelity sound and they are even better. The bass is just the right amount, it is tight and not too "boomy" and it extends nice and low and plays in a way I'd call smooth. The highs are nice and clear, the mids and vocals may be considered slightly recessed, but the overall sound is great for the price.  The cord is only on one side and is 10 feet long so prepare to bunch and tie it up to your desired length if you are going to walk around with these. These headphone will stay on your head better than earbuds (which pop out too much for me), they may make your ears slightly warm but I've never had problems with getting sweaty or being uncomfortable. They are rather bulky but they're great to be used at home. They also DO work with people who wear glasses (there is no ear pinching). They DO let external noise in so don't expect noise cancelling and they do leak sound out since they have port holes, which isn't too bad until you crank the volume and then others will hear and even be able to pick out what you're listening to.  **update- I have had these for 3 years now with moderate use on them, and with more and more use they become more "broken in" and it seems that the bass and treble may have improved a little. They have held up fine, and comparing these to many other headphones and earbuds they are still one of the better sounding ones I have found in this price range, and the only thing I have heard that surpasses them are my newly acquired Sony V6 headphones, which cost around 70 bucks. I did get sick of the two "thin bars" on top of these Panasonics (as others have said)... they aren't horribly uncomfortable but turned out to become annoying. So I modified the headband by mounting the cushioning from another pair of junky headphones I had laying around, and now they are extremely comfortable for hours of listening.	1
I have been a musician (guitar player) for 30+ years .I would think my ear is "educated"...I love them.....for $22.5 they are a buy. Period	1
Yep. The right mic holder. Works perfectly.	1
Made specifically for Sennheiser mics and works fine	1
If you buy this clip you for the appropriate mike (the Senheiser MD46) you won't go wrong....You will be pleased.	1
These didn't sound good on my guitar.  They sound dead.  Will try something different next time.	-1
Very good!!!	1
Great items. Just as described. Fast Shipping and it arrived fast. Great Seller. Will buy more again soon. Thank you.	1
These strings sound very nice on my Cordoba C7 CE.  They have that nice Spanish guitar sound that I like.  I would say that the tension is Medium.  The nylon trebles have a mellow tone with just a touch of brightness. The 5th and 6th strings do produce some finger squeeks.  But, most wound strings do anyway.  So, I guess I can't complain.  The ball ends make it so much easier to change strings.  I am happy with these strings.  I bought 4 packages	1
I've been doing this for almost 30 years.  By the time the tuning stabilized my D string broke, i tied a knot in it at the headstock and by the time i was in tune and started playing the A broke. A lot of wasted time so, back to the more expensive ones.	-1
Best sounding string I've used to date. And they look nice against my maple top guitar. Gonna have to order me a bunch for backups.	1
I've bought 2 packs of these strings within the last 3 years, both at different times and stores.  These look nice and sound ok at first, but just fade away too quickly.  The second set on my Gianinni classical are now only 10 months old and already corroded (I haven't used them that much and keep my hands clean....yet they still are starting to fail with corrosion).  And the 'silver' coating on the bass strings is once again flaking off.  Think I will switch back to D'Addario EJ32 strings or maybe Augustine Classic Black strings.  I used them both in the past, and they sounded and lasted much better and longer than the Ernie strings.  Sorry Ernie; just wasn't having a "ball".....	-1
haven't used yet but opened look good	1
Very good strings, made my old spanish guitar sound like a new one. I'll be ordering new ones soon.	1
Nice smooth tone, durable, and stays in tune for a long time	1
Great looking strings on my black classical guitar. They just need to be checked on for being in tune. Their Funny about needing to be checked daily maybe twice at times. But they are worth the trouble.	1
The strings got it in a couple of days and sound great!	1
I like this product. It was delivered on time. I recommend to everyone.	1
Excellent!	1
this was supposed to come with my guitar pics and other strings but none ever arrived , i did get the guitar though	-1
I liked the fact that these strings were black, but on the 1st string (smallest), there was a sort of "bump" of plastic on the string right where my plucking finger went on the guitar.  Very annoying to say the least.  I had only ordered one set, so I had to use the strings with the bump that scraped my finger every time I played.  I use Ernie 10's on all my electric guitars with no problem, but these weren't so good.	-1
I am normally an Ernie Ball fan.  Haved used their strings for electrics for years, with few issues.  I ordered these to put on my 6 year olds 1/2 size acoustic we got her for Christmas.  How sad that these are made so cheaply.  I was putting on the top E string and had turned the crank less than a few times, not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet, and "pop" it broke.  I had ordered two sets, so I put on the one from the new set.  No problems until I got to the G string, then "pop" another breaker.  Very sad.  The second G worked.  Finally after getting all the strings on and the guitar tuned, it sounds ok, but the g, even though the harmonics matched and my tuner said it was on note, just has a funny sound to it.  Can't explain it.  I picked up some D'arrdio's and had no trouble what so ever.  NO breaks, and NO funny sound from the G string.  Very dissapointed in the quality of these.	-1
While I've had good luck with these packets at times, they do not hold up in winter at all.  I have been running two kits (a total of six packets) in a single acoustic case, the hard case for my J-45, in an effort to keep it adequately humidified during this winter. Unfortunately, what I have found is that once the temperature drops below freezing and the humidity along with it, not even double the recommended number of packets will keep humidity in the case above about 35%. Further, the packets go bad in just 2 or 3 weeks of harsh winter temps.  I should stress that I have not had any problems with my guitar, no cracks or anything of that nature, but this system just can't put out enough humidity to keep the guitar safe in a climate with cold winters.  I have moved to the Oasis system which is refillable and much less expensive (when you consider the cost of replacing all these packets every few weeks across all your guitars).	-1
These work, but they will leak if you don't change them out. I don't think I will buy these again, I will look for a better method of stabilizing my instruments' humidity.	-1
I have tried these for over a month in humid climate (65-75% Humidity). They did nothing to change the humidity inside my hard case for a tenor ukulele, contrary to their claims to keep near 50% humidity.  I installed a temperature/humidity monitor in my case when I bought my instrument. It shows that there is no change to internal humidity compared to external. I'll have to go back to my manual method. I am surprised at the ++ reviews. Perhaps these are from gullible, trusting people who do not actually know what the interior humidity is.  D'Addario should be ashamed, as their strings are top notch. The word 'Fraud' comes to mind. I will be moving to a drier climate soon, and see if these do better adding humidity than they do taking it away.	-1
There are many good things about this that would rate 5 stars. However, the back that hangs from the strings into the body is extremely poorly designed and obviously done on the cheap. It's nearly impossible to set up the bag with that little rod that holds it in (mine won't go in so I had to find something at home slightly smaller). It would be FAR better to have a bag like a friend of mine has that is longer, has two pouches and then you simply hang it by the middle over the two middle strings with no need for any or these hard plastic parts. This part is so annoying that it's taking the rating down from a five to a two. I try very hard to buy domestically made products, but when something is this difficult to use, I'll be looking for a different one as soon as the inserts get hard and are used up, unless D'Addario changes the design.	-1
Only used for 1 month and humidity was staying too high in case! Would not buy again!	-1
I have one of these systems when it was shaped more like a "horse saddle" and draped over the strings - one insert on each side that fit into the sound hole. Now they make it with a cheap plastic part at the top which does not snap on easily at all and when I place it on the strings it touches both ends of the sound hole. If I close my Taylor case it will most certainly scratch or dent the sound hole.  I wish I had not thrown away the packaging because I would have sent this right back.	-1
AWFUL.  The black breathable fabric pouch that is supposed to dangle between the strings is a disaster for the below reasons: 1. You are supposed to clip a polymer dowel into another plastic piece, but this was already showing the white plastic crazing that is the formation of stress lines. This will NOT last too many times. 2. The plastic rod will NOT click into the receiving clip with enough space to let the contained hydration packs suspend freely inside of the guitar's soundhole. 3. The plastic rod/receiver assembly are too long and may mar the surface of the wood on the last fret of your fretboard. Trimming this plastic is more of a hacksaw project than a pocket knife project.  All in all, they had a MUCH better system with their first version. I will NOT buy this again.  PS: you can rehydrate these packs by putting them (the brown packs only, not the fabric pouches) in a sealed plastic container with a few centimeters of water under them. Do NOT let them touch the water. Use a stand-off of some sort (I use cut plastic Dixie/party cups). If you put this sealer container on top of a heater or in direct sunlight, the packs should rehydrate within a few days.	-1
I wish I had read the reviews more thoroughly before ordering this.  The instructions puzzled me because I did NOT receive what was described. In an apparent move to save themselves some money, what they sell now includes a cheap vinyl 1-pouch version that could very easily slip into the guitar and ruin it. It is NOT double sealed, as they repeatedly claim in the instructions!!!  And based on the number of horror stories I've seen here about ruined guitars, there is simply NO way I'm going to trust this to humidify my expensive Olson. They must think their customers are stupid and/or insane.  Shame on D'Addario and Planet Waves for this bait and switch. I'm returning it, and telling everyone I know to avoid this product.	-1
The older style Humidipak was really good, but D'addario recently changed the pouches that the gel packs are held in.  The pouches now include two annoying little plastic pieces that you have to attach and detach every time you replace the gel packs.  They are not easy to attach and if you're a classical guitarist, it is easy to break a nail getting these on.  If the plastic isn't put on, the pouch will just fall into the sound hole, so you have no choice but to risk breaking a nail on this hard to close plastic piece.  Furthermore, the sound hole pouch used to include 2 pouches, but now you are expected to put two gel packs into one sound hold pouch.  The old pouches made out of the OLD material were MUCH better.  I will only buy this again if D'addario redesigns the pouch or goes back to the old one.	-1
Major design flaws, and the photos on this ad are not what I received. The loose pouch came with a cheap plastic tube, that is supposed to be inserted into another plastic tube with a slit. That's the closing mechanism. Took me 20 minutes to jimmy it through, since the tubes are not sized properly. Once I finished that part, realized this plastic tube (meant for hanging above the strings) is way to long for my guitar's sound hole (Taylor 114). Added cloth tape to the ends, hoping it won't scratch anything this way. Lastly, the pouch doesn't fit inside the guitar because it's way too tall. Have to stick my fingers under the strings and push it to it's side. Which would be okay, except the plastic tube still won't sit flush.  Cumbersome and not as advertised. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the actual gel packs seem useful. Will be looking for another housing for the packs. Too bad, seemed like it could have been a perfect solution.	-1
This used to be a GREAT product and I once gave it 5 stars.  However, they changed the system that puts the packets in the guitar case.  When it was a double sided packet that hung over and between the strings it worked !  Plus, it was quick and easy to work with.  When you got to a gig all you had to do was open the case and take off the Humidipak and place it in the case....at the end of a show it was so simple to just put it back as you put the guitar back in the case.  This new system is TERRIBLE....It is obviously done to save money but to me it just made using the product very inconvenient and a real PIA.  Hanging the bag on the D G strings and attaching this piece of plastic is a real problem.  It is not nearly as good as the older system.  In fact, it's enough of an issue to make me look to something else.  If it ain't broke don't fix it !	-1
Newest version is awful - I get why they changed it bc the earlier versions had leakage problems but I liked the old version with the double pouch that you hung over the strings inside the soundhole.  The new version is dumb.  You put two packs inside the same pouch and it's this like rubber lined pouch.  and then you have a stick you have to snap into this holder that holds the pouch closed.  but it doesn't fit in my guitar.  the stick is too long for the sound hole so it is up against the fretboard and it's not laying flat because the depth of my guitar isn't super wide.  I just do not like this newest pouch system.  I am going to see if I can find anymore of the old one.	-1
This is a review of the "New Improved" design. I have another one of these that I have used for a few years.  The previous design was 2 parts. The single pouch that fits up near the head of the guitar and a two-part pouch (like saddle bags) which held a humidity pack in each pouch side. The saddle bags then draped over the strings and hung inside the sound hole. The image used for the sale item shows the older, saddle bag design.  The new (not) improved design still has the single pouch for the head which is still made of the same material. The saddle bag design is now made of a more rubberized material with only a single pouch. Both of the humidity packs have to be crammed into this smaller space. The single opening is then draped over a plastic dowel. The dowel then has to be forced into a plastic clamp which is then rested on the strings while the pouch dangles inside the sound hole. The pocket of the pouch is so full of humidity packs that you have to force the strings apart to slip it through them. Not only does the hard plastic of these new pieces seem to risk the wood of the guitar, the nature of the plastic is destined to fatigue and fail with more use.  I would recommend you seek out the previous design instead of this "new" one. It seems to be easier to use, less likely to damage your guitar, and like it will last longer.	-1
I have Taylor Grand Concert sized guitars.  The plastic tube assembly is longer than the sound hole so it is impossible for it to hang on the strings as it hits the guitar top and neck.  Even if the bag could hang it would be too long to hang freely, it hits the back of the guitar.  What guitars do these actually work on?	-1
I have been using this product for years with my guitars. I swore by it. Then they have changed the sound hole piece to an overcomplicated piece of crap you can barely fit the two bags into, then have to force some sort of over-sized string hanger clip on to seal it. I have a pretty standard sized guitar for the modern day. It's a cutaway Martin grand auditorium size. The "string hanger" is too big for the sound hole and rubs against the fingerboard (or the top wood: your choice). Also, the bag is too deep bottoming out on the back inside the guitar to where the "string hanger" sticks up above the strings and folds over when you close the case. Not a good re-design at all. Zero stars if I could from what used to be a 5-star product.  I know they redesigned it because a couple of the older models leaked inside someones guitar; I get it. However, the new design is awful. So disappointed here.	-1
I have bought these before from Guitar Center and they lasted about two to three  months.  The first packet I used from ones I bought from Amazon were dry in less than two weeks and that is with a damp sponge in my case.  I don't know if these were old or a bad batch or what, but a big waste of money.	-1
not so good  ~  you have to keep on shelling out $20 to get new packs ...	-1
I can not in good conscience recommend this product.  I had a brand new Takamine $1,200 guitar and was using these to help preserve it.  I must have received a defective pack as it leaked a gooey gel into the body of my guitar.  I had to bring it to a luthier for repair and it ruined the interior label.  This guitar is no longer made in Japan and it essentially damaged a collectible instrument.  To their credit, D'Addario did cover the luthier costs, but like I said, I simply cannot recommend this product.  You are better off going to a music store that sells band instruments and get one of those green rubber tubes they put in a double-bass.  The tube has a sponge in it and you wet it down, dry it off and place it in the sound hole and it helps keep the humidity just fine (it's what my local guitar tech and luthier uses for his acoustic guitars).	-1
These humidipaks are great and work just like they are supposed to. That being said. I will never again buy more than one at a time and use it immediately. I purchased several to save money. Several months later when I opened a new package I discovered the packets had leaked and they were useless. Too late for any returns. Money out the window.	-1
These are good for maintaining your favorite guitars however, the quality control by the manufacturer is severly lacking. I recently bought several of these and (2) of the packages only had (2) of the humid paks...(1) of the the (3) that are supposed to be in them, was missing. I love Amazon.com but, I don't recommed that you buy these online unless you want to get ripped off or have to go through the hassle of returning them.  Buy them in your local music store and open the package right there at the counter before you leave the store to make sure everything is there. Plant Waves is definitely at out of orbit....	-1
These don't last long at all. None came anywhere near the advertised life. You will spend lots of money on replacement humidipacks.  This is kind of like ink for printers.  Sell them the system, soak them for the up keep.	-1
These are a waste of time. I have 3 separate hygrometers that all read 60-70% humidity with these in the case. I purchased these because they were supposed to help bring the humidity down to 45-55% (or up if needed). Sadly, they just don't do much. Quite an expense and not very trustworthy.	-1
They say 2-4 months, I've never come close to even a month. Usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks.  If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.  I don't recommend these.	-1
The D string snapped as I was tuning. All other strings tuned fine. I took all the strings off and I will try either go back to metal strings or try another nylon set	-1
These strings lose it's reasoning quality in a short period of time.	-1
Totally my fault, as I knew for the price they had to be poor quality.  Other than lighting up when you plug them in, they are terrible. If you need a true, round, edge focused spot pattern, or are expecting the bulbs to match up with 'real' #4515 Par Lamps, don't buy them.	-1
Not what I'd call a "pin spot". At 10 feet distance the center, brightest part of the light beam is about 16 inches across, with the overall beam spread going out to about 5 feet. This is probably more a function of the bulb than the fixture, but the fixture itself is not focusable in any way, so be aware of what you're getting.  As others have noted, the mounting bail is very thin. I can literally bend it between my thumb and 2 fingers. This is NOT a light for a portable DJ or band.	-1
DO NOT buy this! I made the mistake of not returning it by the time the return policy "closed" and now I'm stuck with it. I wasted $17.00 dollars. Terrible stand that does not work! Amazon should be ashamed by selling this product. And now they won't take it back. Very disappointed in Amazon.	-1
The base of this stand is fine but the top flat section that holds the music is made a very thin metal. It was bent when it arrived and I could easily bend it back into (sort of) a flat plane against which to place the music. It's doing the job but I would not buy this again - I wish I had purchased a Manhasset.	-1
Too Heavy. Unmanageable. Returned it.	-1
This ONLY works if your microphone stand is NOT equipped with a boom. Mine is. I waited to long to return it and it now it sits in my music closet. My bad.	-1
Not well made.  The idea is good, but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired.  Where the stand attaches to the arm, I cannot get a good, solid connection.  Afraid if I try to use it as is, it will fall apart on stage.  This is definitely going to require some modification to make it work.	-1
Does not extend far enough away from the stand to be able to position it in any usable way.  If your mic cradle is the 'suspended' type that typically supports a condenser mic then absolutely avoid this, it will jam up against the cradle and you will not be able to angle it any way.  It's of marginal use if you are using a dynamic (SM58 style) mic with more side-clearance but even then expect to go boss-eyed trying to read it.	-1
The arm is extremely short and should be longer	-1
Too big an bulky for my needs but is well made and worked fine. I returned it.	-1
This would be a  great item except for two things....  Mine had a bad/crooked weld on the arm that connects to the music holder.  It appears to have screw or rivet holes there as well, that are not used, and you can see that these don't line up.  The music holder listed to the left.  Also, the screw threads on the cast iron bracket are flimsy and would strip easily if you tighten it too much.  I had to return my unit.  Would have been nice.  I wasn't offered an exchange as an option, so I decided to buy a real music stand instead, for around the same price with the refund.  The ChromaCast Pro, which is made really well, is sturdy, and has a full size music holder.	-1
Cheap packaging ruined this experience for me. Instead of packaging each string separately, they wrapped them all together in one jumbled mass of wire inside a sealed plastic sleeve. The high E and B strings were severely kinked in several places, which made unwrapping all the strings very difficult  The E and B were unusable. The remaining strings are now spares.	-1
I am very disappointed in these strings. They do note resonate like my Martin Silk and Steel. Thought I would give them a try but I will stick with Martin strings.	-1
lots of string noise	-1
buy martins instead, nothing personal, but i like a more warmer tone and not so much a manufactured tone from my guitar strings, they still sounded like stock string to me.	-1
Not a great product, very pricey for what it is. No on/off switch is a real annoyance, no option for a A/C cable.	-1
Had to purchase a power supply and solder it in otherwise the baterys drain even when not in use.  SHOULD HAVE POWER SWITCH!!!!  It dose function properly.	-1
Useless because the battery is constantly being drained when cords are plugged into it.  This makes it unpredictable for live performances, as the battery may die at any time.	-1
I'm very disappointed in the FS-6.  The reason is plain and simple, it has a battery (no option for external adapter) that is drained every time you plug something in.  Basically if you have a static setup you will need to unplug this unit each time you are done practicing or your battery will be dead by the next time you use it.  I have their FS-5U which is a great pedal and will likely be ordering one of those to replace this one.  Extremely disappointed in Boss's design on this one.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I bought this pedal as a companion to my Roland AC-33 Acoustic Amp.  The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy.  However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate.  This is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch.  The worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out.  The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made.  For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that Boss would put out a better product.  I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site.	-1
As usual, the brilliance of Roland/Boss goes hand in hand with head slapping stupidness that just makes you go WHAT? I have a Boss GT-10 guitar processor, and this footswitch is designed to look like an extension of the GT-10, so one would figure that when they designed the 10, they designed this thing too.  With that in mind, I take issue with the following items: 1.  The FS-6 needs a battery.  WHAT? There is no AC Adapter or a place to plug one in. WHAT? 2.  There is no cable included to connect it to your gear.  You have to buy it separately.  Trust me...you probably don't have one of these just laying around. 3.  The power is turned off and on by inserting and removing the cable(s).  So when I am turning on my gear I need to remember to plug in the footswitch cable(s) and remember to unplug them when I'm done.  Every time I forget, a 9 volt battery is toast.  Not very green, Boss. And why does this thing not communicate more elegantly with Boss gear in the first place? A cable that passes electrical current from the processor to the footswitch would have been lovely.  Hell, my old Digitech Valve FX did that.  Could easily be done by using USB to connect it to the GT-10 instead of TRS audio cables.  So now I have a full day of shopping ahead of me because I gave Boss sixty bucks for a product that, apart from appearance, doesnt go with my GT 10 any more than a fish goes with a bicycle.  I have to go and buy a stereo to stereo 1/4 inch cable.  Then I will need a 9v adapter from Radio Shack.  I also need a new power strip.  I will attach the 9v cable to the stereo cable with twist ties and run them both up to the power strip, where I will plug the GT-10 and the 9v adaptor so I don't have to worry about plugging and unplugging cables to power the unit off and on (subjecting the unit to abuse, unnecessary wear and tear, and potential damage) or leaving them plugged in (and pointlessly using up dozens of batteries).  It is amazing to me how poorly Boss and Roland products work together and how little thought they put into some of the simplest things while exhibiting brilliance and genius in other areas.  My guess is that this unit doesnt work elegantly with the GT-10 because they wanted to be able to sell it for use with devices other than Boss products.  But who would really buy that, since it is the most expensive footswitch on the market and the ONLY reason you would ever buy one is to match your Boss gear...more specifically your Boss GT-10 or GT-10 B, the only units in existence that use the black pedal on the silver case.  So as long as you are making a switch for such a specific audience, how about making it play nice with that processor?  I expected the usual brilliance and got the usual stupidity.  Having Boss and Roland gear is like having a really smart, beautiful girlfriend who occasionally screams obscenities at your parents for no reason.  Off to go shopping for the other fifty bucks worth of stuff I need to make this thing work.	-1
I want to be fair, overall I think the sounds on this unit are very good.  But I wanted a drum machine that was not confusing to program songs on for someone that liked playing and not programming things all day.  I play guitar, drums, bass and I sing and do them all proficiently.  But I felt that I would rather program a drum machine instead of ordering a whole drumset to play on my recordings.  I did online searches of reviews to seek out a simple drum machine that had the ability to program songs.  The Zoom was the one most people touted as easier to understand.  Maybe so, maybe more than the Roland or Alesis...but it still it too time consuming for anyone who wants to just play and get to recording.  I don't want to sit in menus all day, it kills the creative juices immediately.  So I sent it back and ordered a Yamaha electronic drumset which suits me much better.  This unit will be great for someone who wants to sit and learn a whole other piece of equipment...but if you want to get to playing and not programming, this is not it.	-1
This could be a good machine except for several flaws, the main one being that the time sig. cannot be changed on any of the preset patterns. So if you like a pattern but need it in 3/4 instead of 4/4 time, you can't change it. What really burns me up is that two people posted answers in the Customers Questions and Answers section and stated you can change the time sig. One even quoted the manual on page 64 which said "Set the time signature for the pattern to 1 -8 (1/4 - 8/4 beat).  But he left out the next line in the manual that added that setting "The time signature of an already recorded pattern (indicated by "*" on the display) is not possible."  So all of the 439 patterns are pre-recorded, have an * when you bring up the time sig., and so none of them can be changed.  Not only that, but the manual's list of all 439 patterns does not list the time sig for any of them. As far as I have seen by scrolling through a bunch of them, they are all 4/4 time. But if any are not, how would I know which ones they are, without searching through each of the 439 patterns and hitting the function and time sig keys to display the time sig for every one of them?  Once again another comment regarding time sig in the Customer Question and answer section stated "Just read the Manual I downloaded online and it does play a wide variety of time signatures". How can he know this when the manual doesn't list the time signature associated with any of the patterns?  So not only am I disappointed in not being able to change the time sig from 4/4 to 3/4 on any of the stored patterns, even if I copy them to the user stored pattern section, but there is no info in the manual on which patterns (if any) are in 3/4 time. Scrolling through the patterns I haven't found a single 3/4 time sig on any pattern.  But I am completely disgusted that I based my purchase decision on two people's comments in the Customer Questions and Answers section stating the time sig could be changed. As far as I can see, this is completely false. If I'm wrong I'd be very happy to change this review. But it appears I can't use any of this machine's 439 preset patterns for any song with a 3/4 beat, which is incredibly disappointing.  Another problem with this machine is that you can only scroll through the 439 patterns in order by pressing the + or - button. So to get to pattern 305 you need to hold the plus key from pattern 1 (or from the last stored pattern) until it gets to 305.  I jam several times a month playing 60's and 70s classic and soft rock, and some country and folk. Stones, Beatles, Dylan, Winwood, Clapton, etc. There are very few drum patterns other than a handful of the blues patterns that are suitable for the type of music I play. Most of the machine is dedicated, to beats, hip hop, techno, etc. So about 90% of the patterns are not patterns I can use for the music I play. Even most of the ballad patterns are not suitable, adding strange licks to the beat. There are virtually no clean shuffle or simple ballad, folk or country patterns. Whoever programmed these patterns was looking to show off, rather than provide simple usable tracks for jamming to.  On the plus side the actual drum kits aren't bad. I was able to create a simple 3/4 time pattern in real time using the pads. A problem with entering a pattern in real time is the metronome set up. The metronome patterns are mostly complex and the metronome is louder than the drums (regardless of which metronome sound you use). I used the basic 4/4 metronome beat and set the tempo to 40 (which is as low as it goes) which allowed me to create a 120bpm 3/4 pattern using each beat of the metronome as the one of the three beat count. I recorded about 11 minutes of the pattern, and if I want it at a slower tempo, I will need to change the tempo on my computer using an audio editor. This is better than creating the whole drum track from samples in an audio editor, so I am getting a bit of a benefit from it. Now that I have this machine I'll try to get some use out of it.	-1
I like the older ones better... the older ones easier to program	-1
Defective. So I had to send it back.	-1
Not able to adjust it to be short enough, and I bought the shorter length too. Heats up and causes sweat under the strap, does not wick any moisture at all, as advertised, but in fact creates heat and moisture. Not sure if it lessens the weight of my Precision bass... sure feels as heavy as it usually is... too bad! Will keep searching for a good bass strap...	-1
Give me a break. I ordered a regular strap and it had my guitar hanging up by my neck at full length. I don't think these guys have a clue about rock and roll guitar straps although the concept is a good one. Perhaps this was for a midget?	-1
I didn't find it adjustable enough, and I couldn't get it to a height I liked. Keep in mind that I like playing my instrument kind of close to my chest, than my stomach. The strap it self seemed kind of rigid in my opinion.	-1
UPDATED JAN 2018 Downgraded from 5 stars to 1 - disappointed with the new design These are no longer the same dimensions as the 'Neotech 8301052 Mega Bass Strap, Black' the neoprene is now shorter and the leather on the front is also a different length now! The adjustment on the back of the strap was at the bottom which was easy to adjust while wearing the bass, now it's at the top so you have to remove the bass to adjust the length of the strap. I don't think these changes were well thought out at all, maybe this was a cost saving change more than a quality of product change... very disappointing  The beauty of the original design was that if you had a bass with a heavy neck it would eliminate 'neck dive' e.g. - Warwick Thumb with Wenge neck - the new strap design has much less neoprene to 'grip' to your clothing.  Now searching for a better alternative :-(  WOW WOW WOW! Very pleased with this strap, don't know why I waited so long to replace my old strap as it was killing my shoulder. The Neotech is extremely comfortable and makes my heavy headless bass feel feather-light now!  The materials are nice and soft, distributes the weight well and stays in place.  The leather ends are very thick and stiff, which made it tough to get them on but they certainly won't fall off, so don't think I need strap locks :-)  American Made, nice quality.	-1
The strap is comfortable, and supports the banjo well, but if you store your banjo in a case and don't want to completely detach the strap-- you're outta luck. The hard plastic buckles left dents on the heel of my banjo. I still use this strap on one of my cheaper banjos, but I can't afford to lose the resale value on a higher end banjo.	-1
I bought this to relieve the weight of a heavy guitar. Long story short; it did not relieve the weight of the guitar enough to make a difference. I can't blame the product entirely; it may be that my shoulder is just too shot to bear the weight of a heavy solidbody guitar any more. But it definitely did not work any better at relieving weight than my 4" wide Onori leather guitar strap. Another problem is that because of the way it's made, the widest part of the strap does not go over your shoulder; it lands on the front part of your shoulder, mostly on your chest. Unless you want the top bout of your guitar directly under your chin, the widest part of the strap is never going to be over your shoulder. (And I am not one of those guys who slings his guitar low like Jimmy Page or Johnny Ramone.) Further, it's made out of a really awful-feeling foam-rubber like material which is a sure-fire sweat inducer. Overall, this thing is a bust. I would send it back and ask for my money back, but like a dummy, I threw away the packaging right after I opened it up. Save your money, kids.	-1
The materials and workmanship on this strap are good but the strap button holes were literally so tight and small I couldn't get them on my bass!  I returned it promptly and bought another brand.	-1
Way too big. Sorry I purchased them big time. Was away and didn't open the box till after the return date expired. &^(	-1
elastic is junk. I have this mount from original mic. it stretches out, then nothing. you can make little wraps of it around mount pins as it fails, but its otherwise junk. don't waste your $$ on this	-1
These picks need a better grip area.  Sound great though.  A bit too thick for me. They will last forever.	-1
Way too big for a Martin DCPA4.  It is so far off that you don't even want to start sanding it down.  I'd say about 4mm to tall, and 0.5 - 1mm too thick.  Do not buy for a Martin DCPA4 or similar.  I need to find one that's much closer to the original.	-1
Well constructed heavy duty stand but it causes the guitar to lean back at an excessive angle. My Martin guitar fell out of it but fortunately no damage. I have other Hercules stands that I'm very satisfied with but this one went to the Goodwill.	-1
I have a Martin DM which has slight string buzz on the highest 3 strings... Bought this because of the reviews. I would consider myself somewhat meticulous.  I did not see any guidance as to sanding the width which was necessary make it fit my Martin DM. Filing one side versus another, does affect the contact sharpness where it touches the strings. I used my best judgment and sanded the side that faces the back of the guitar (not sure if this is the best side, then did a combination of both sides). Either way... picture sharpening a knife, which you do from the sides. This makes the top, contact part of the knife sharper. The outcome was only a slightly better sound, which was achieved only after  touching up the top of the bridge (doubt that was the manufacture's intent) to make the strings sit naturally which was not achieved easily due to the sharp angles on top, due to narrowing the width. Seems like they should be more precise with the widths offered, or guidance on narrowing the width, relative to how it will affect the top of the bridge where it makes contact with the strings, especially since the marketing of this product implies that it is suitable for a standard Martin Guitar.	-1
When I purchased this I'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar. Guess what? As far as I can tell, there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with. This is NOT worth the money.	-1
This item was TOO lightweight! Flimsy, it didn't properly hold the guitar, was unstable on a hard floor and simply fell over on carpet. Might hold a ukulele, but don't risk your guitar on this!	-1
Just personal preference, way to stiff for the kind of music I play and the way I play it - I like picks with a little be bend to them (not much, just a bit) - if you like super hard point picks you'll probably like these - I didn't.	-1
Disapointed. The sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound. It sound muffled. I will have to replace it soon.	-1
Too wide for any of my guitars. Too short for them and that is the problem, I can't grow it.	-1
The problem that the Dare Guitar Strap seeks to address is the comfort of playing a heavy guitar or bass for lengthy sessions with a standard strap that might cut into your shoulder. Rather than a wider strap (which has worked wonderfully for my bass playing), DAddario has gone the route of two straps that potentially distribute the weight on two shoulders. Unfortunately, due to the design of a guitar and the way it is played, this strap actually adds to the discomfort that it seeks to alleviate.  Unlike a saxophone strap which attaches to the horn at a single point, a guitar strap attaches on the horn or near the neck and at a second point at the bottom of the instrument. If you are right-handed the standard strap lays over your left shoulder. On the Dare strap a second strap lays over your right shoulder, snapping to the standard side of the strap. If the guitar hung from this united point you might gain some benefit but the other end of the strap is still attached to the base of the guitar. No matter how I adjusted the second strap to shift some of the weight of the instrument to my right shoulder, as soon as I started playing and the guitar moved around, the weight distribution shifted and the second strap would cut into my neck making the whole experience measurably more uncomfortable.  Kudos for trying to improve the players experience but this needs to go back to the drawing board.	-1
Blows	-1
I was fortunate enough to buy 2 of the original Dare straps about 8 years ago - before Planet Waves took over this product.  I recently purchased one of the new ones and am very disappointed. The originals were much better quality than these are. Too bad Planet Waves cheapened the materials and basically ruined a great product.	-1
I had high hopes for this strap, which is basically a good design, but it has two fatal problems for me.  1. The large metal snap is placed so that it will scratch most guitars. Only a solid-body electric with an upper strap button on the top cutaway, as shown in the pictures, will avoid this. On a heel button, the snap will rub on the finish. Not what I want on an SG, Les Paul, archtop, or acoustic.  2. The leather endpieces are so stiff that I was afraid I would yank the strap buttons out of the guitar, both when putting them on and later when removing them (before returning the item). Moreover the stiff leather is another likely source of scratches.  So basically: If you don't care about scratches, or if you have a strap button like the one shown, this can work for you. But otherwise beware.	-1
Guitar case is good but I've ordered 3 (not from the same vendor) and they all had messed up latches or they didn't close right.	-1
What a piece of junk - poorly made - don't buy one made in Mexico.	-1
This is NOT a real Martin, this is a Mexican made "guitar" with no trussrod (better hope your neck stays strait!) and a ridiculously thick neck. I actually like beefy necks but this makes my 67' harmony feel like a strat, to clarify the Harmony is a baseball bat. The frets were very rough and the but appears to be standard crap tier plastic, the tuners are unbranded garbage.  I'm not a gear snob by any means, but this is daylight robbery. I understood it would lack the classic Martin tone being so small but the craftsmanship or lack thereof is inexcusable. This isn't worthy of the Martin name.	-1
Very uncomfortable and high e string too close to edge of fretboard.	-1
This is a cool guitAr but not very fun to play it's it's neck is to heavy an you have to have a strap to play it it's very hard to play the little martin is the way to go it smokes this one	-1
I shouldn't have to pay extra for this fix.	-1
Couldn't install the included driver or the ASIO4ALL driver on my laptop (Toshiba with Realtek soundcard) and based on what I see, more often than not it's the case. Without the ASIO driver, on PC, you get latency that makes the interface useless. UPDATE: Tried to contact Behringer, but no one got back to me in over a week.	-1
I received this (after asking for it) for Christmas as a gift. This is not a good product. It does not work. The software supplied with it is dated and obsolete, and doesn't install in Windows 10 but as a well trained computer expert, I should have had no trouble with making it work. I did not succeed in doing so before I decided that this thing is just not worth the effort. I'll be returning this and I do not recommend that anyone buy it. I have not (yet) found an inexpensive yet useful guitar to computer interface other than Rocksmith with it's native required cable.	-1
Product did not work. The computer knows something is plugged in but even with the asio sound driver installed and chosen it refuses to work.	-1
3 months later and it stopped working, all had been right, I was playing JAZZ with my guitar and it stopped working  Please don't waste your money... you must go for another guitar interface, if you want a guitar link, choose the generical guitar link for 7$, this is joke, comes with 450 pages of instruction and an old cd with a bad software.	-1
DIdnt work for me, not a happy camper.	-1
The software stuff I is super confusing and not sure with works simply so an  interface.	-1
Didn't like this at all. Couldn't get it to work.	-1
Would not work on my MacBook. Returned it	-1
Very bad lag...used it once or twice and gave up.	-1
Doesn't work at all. The drivers are totally fubared. Don't bother with this piece of junk. It's not even worth the shipping to send it back.	-1
I foolishly bought two of these WORTHLESS products, thinking they'd be awesome for my two teenage sons to use with their electric guitars and laptop computers, but to my utter dismay, BOTH UCG102 packages arrived in factory-sealed boxes WITHOUT an enclosed CD as advertised.  It clearly states in the official product User Manual that a CD containing the Native Instruments software in supposed to be enclosed in the box, and yet, it wasn't. It also clearly shows a picture of a CD containing music software on the external packaging and states right on the box that such a CD is enclosed in the packaging, yet it was not. Thus, there were no drivers, no Native Instruments music software, no amp modeling, no nothing to allow use of the product, and consequently, neither of the two boys could use the product for their birthdays as intended.  I sent both of these boxes back for a refund and I will NEVER purchase another product made by Behringer, not EVER again! What a complete waste of my time and energy.	-1
..it works. But expect some flaws. First,finding a driver to use was a pain. It doesn't come with a software disc,so look on Behringer's support site for driver download. Whatever driver you do use it kills all other audio,you can't run any other media player and get sound. My advice is unless you have a dedicated PC or laptop for using this...get something else.	-1
What a nightmare.  Received as a Christmas present.  Opened the package....no software.  Didn't come with the CD.  Tried to download it from their website, and when it asked for my serial number, I looked on the device and the "S/N" was displayed, but NO SERIAL NUMBER!!!  Seriously????  Amazon.com, what kind of garbage are you putting out??  I'll have to try and call the company in the morning to see if they can either walk me through a download, or send me a CD with the required software.  VERY disappointed.	-1
I bought this to run my laptop with Amplitube for live situations.  I am currently using my mbox2 and wanted something smaller.  The latency with this is audible.  It's not like you will have to run a test to see the latency, your brain will wonder why it does not hear sound after it hits the string.  I know there are a ton of ways to decrease latency on the computer but the fact is that I was running the mbox without problem.  Just to make sure I hooked it up to my desktop i7 2600k to see if that made a difference and it did not.  It seems some folks love this thing but I don't know how.  I did not check to see the latency if I were only recording so I suppose it could be ok for that.  I doubt it though.	-1
warning, interface is 44.1 16 bit. thats REALLY lame. should be 48K 24bit minimum, and 96K capable.  the software / amp sim that comes with this does NOT WORK under 10.7 / LION. OEM's website is a mess to navigate and figure out anything, and it appears they simply do not have a 10.7 compatible update out.  this will work just fine with garage band after some software fiddling, and also works fine with apple's MainStage. in fact MS will automatically see it which is cool.  a bit overpriced for the lame specs and software that doesn't work on a mac.	-1
The handles Sucks it ripped the second time I used it.	-1
It is apparent whatever clown designed this bag has never actually had a gig in his or her life!!! Please note: you will need to strip off every end bracket/ connector off the truss to make it fit!!! Also, shoulder strap does not exist!! Otherwise quality appears to be good. I am sending it back.	-1
Over rated....	-1
Utter crap cheap materials broke in a month of light use...	-1
Was broken and unusable after only a few uses.	-1
The right angle assembly is poorly engineered.  The pole part is loose and causes pops & cut outs.  At home it wasn't too bad, but when used onstage to connect a pedal, caused HORRRIBLE feedback and popping noise.  Had to disconnect and use a full length instrument cord to replace.  At home it was obviously not fixable unless you unsolder the right angle end and replace with another.  Might as well buy a new, different brand cable.	-1
You get what you pay for.....That said, do not buy this cable.  I used maybe three times an the right angle connector started coming apart. Poor quality....I did not contact anyone about this, not worth the effort.  Going to spend a little more money and get a better cable.	-1
was crackling when it got here. seems like something located in the line and not a connector, actually. sending back.	-1
I bought this for home use when I occasionally want to play through an amp (infrequent).  The good news is that the cable is well shielded and there's little noise.  The bad news is that the right angle connector wasn't properly set in the fitting.  It popped out after only limited use (a couple of times a week over 4months).  I can see no evidence that there was any weld or glue holding the 1/4" plug in the elbow.  If you get one that doesn't fall apart, you'll enjoy it.	-1
Great for a week, then it broke at the right angle...sigh...	-1
The 90 degree connector broke the first time i use it , built very cheap. I will not buy again.	-1
Bad quality. The jack keep on getting disassembled when pulling out of thr guitar.	-1
It's a nice cable, but after only a few uses, the right angle connector separated and shorted out. It will need to be replaced. I guess at this price point it shouldn't be surprising.	-1
Initially I was impressed with this cable. Only to have the unit fail in the field. The 90 degree connectors are poorly built. They are pressed together and easily break apart. Attempted to repair, but had to force enough pressure on tip that seperated the isolator between the T & S, rendering it untrustable. Before discovering the issue, guitar would cut out, and didn't suspect the cable as it was relatively new. But cable it was. If you are using this for home use, might be okay. For live performances, stay away. The straight end looks great, well constructed, protected by heat shrink. Have had other Hosa cables that were good, just the construction of this right angle plug allows the sleve to seperate from the base, lifting the ground connection.	-1
Worked only for a little while then just shorts out making gaps of silence. Two stars for working perfectly for almost a month.	-1
After less than 3 months of use, the right angle piece went open to ground inside the 90 degree angle. It was difficult to find, but the male piece was loose and could not be opened for repair. I would not recommend this to a friend, though the straight connector seems OK so far. When it fails, of course it begins to pick up a loud hum fromt the wall sockets.	-1
it's very flimsy and didn't last long	-1
wouldn't buy again. Main input is loose and cracks and is almost useless after one month of rare use. Do not buy this cheap piece of doo doo	-1
Great cable for the money.  The 90 degree connectors are excellent to minimize the strain on acoustic guitar jacks.  ***Edit*** I have changed this rating from 5 stars to 2. The 90 degree connectors are poorly built. They are pressed together and easily break apart. I believe the connection on the 90 degree end is also the culprit for occasional noise. The straight ends seem to hold up well though.	-1
It's really too short. you can't get far enough away from the amp to eliminate feedback and interference.	-1
This cable lasted for maybe a few months before it stopped working.  I play every day, mostly just sitting on the couch which is why I thought the right angle would work well for me, but it didn't really end up being the right cable for how I was using it, probably more user error than a quality issue but the cable I bought next was a bit more expensive and is still in use after a couple of years.	-1
Don't like these cables, they're cheesy and the ends keep unscrewing for no reason. Would not buy any Hosa brand gear again	-1
Very weak cable. I don't think I will get a year of "home use" out of them, let alone trying to "Gig" with.	-1
In fact, I don't think this Hosa GTR215R cord lasted 2 hours. One step on the cord and it came apart. This purchase is the very reason why I'm looking to buy a wireless system. Maybe if you're using this to run a PA I would recommend it. But if any performer is hard on their cords I wouldn't recommend this item....but to be fair, I would recommend wireless to any performer. You'll end up saving money over the long haul.	-1
The cable causes random loud crackling noises. I tried switching socket, guitar, amp, cable: it's this cable. Strange enough it makes that loud noise only with my tube amp, while the crack and hiss is barely noticeable with the little transistor amp. Again, I run all the possible tests swapping every element in the sound chain one by one and it is definitely the cable causing the noise.	-1
Im not a professorial so this is ok for me. If you want something that will last you a while then got with something with better quality.	-1
I am very responsible with my guitar cables. I always roll them up and put them away when I am not using them. I got this cable because it looked durable. Within a week of getting it it had a short in it and after a month it didn't work. The connectors themselves are good quality, but the cable is crap.	-1
It's worth is to bite the bullet and get a Mogami cable. But search eBay. There is a guy that makes them for about half price of Guitar Center.	-1
The 1/4" angled plug is too short to fit into Fender Telecaster, which has a bushing on the plug hole.  The straight plug fits.  No reason to make the angled plug shorter; it probably won't fit many other guitars as well.  Cord also cuts out sometimes.	-1
I didn't expect this cable to be so thin. It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used. Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable.  Still, it works and was inexpensive.  EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already.  Wire frayed at the right angle jack.  You get what you pay for.	-1
I bought this based on the other reviews.  I only needed a short cable while I sit on the couch and plug into a small battery powered amp.  This cable caused some feedback in the amp - I recommed skipping this, paying extra and getting a good braided cable.  I just bought a Spectraflex original series 6ft right angle tweed cable and it works fine - but it is around $10 more.	-1
My son bought an Epiphone ES 339 Dot.  (smaller brother to the ES 335)  I was surprised when we flipped the guitar over to find the Grover name and Deluxe on the tuners.  His complaint, it just won't stay in tune.  He is a lifelong musician, with tons of experience in worship bands, choirs, celtic group, all kinds of equipment.  We tried a new set of 2221 Nickel Slinky's, and fiddled with the intonation.  He has had the guitar for 9 months.  He kept borrowing my AS 73 Ibanez, and commented that he love it, no mention of it going out of tune.  So we have a comparable to run the Epi against.  We removed the offending G tuner, flipped it over and well, everything is bradded into place, covers would likely not reinstall if removed which would require drilling out.  Inside all the tuners you could see grease, so all were well greased.  Why would this one string not hold it's tune.  And being a Grover user for a dozen years I'm familar with the Sta-tite tuners.  We were shot down other than petition Epiphone for Warranty Repair.  I have not had success with any warranty Epiphone.  The guitar was bought new at a well known guitar sales center, so maybe we will give them a shout.  If these had been Grover Rotomatics, I don't think we'd be having this conversation at all.	-1
I got these to replace the stock Gibson tuners on my LP Classic.  Since they've been installed, I've spent more time fighting to keep my guitar in tune than I had been with the Gibson tuners.  I'm super disappointed, since so many people have said so many great things about these tuners.  Outside of the fact they they don't keep my guitar in tune worth a crap, they are heavy and seem well-made.  They are a perfect fit.  Just *fail* on the one reason I got them.  Sorry, Grover.  I really wanted to like these.  :-(	-1
THEY GO OUT OF TUNE, OR COMPLETELY DIE VERY QUICKLY. AFTER A WEEK OR TEO THERE ARE MISSING NOTES.	-1
Its nice to have two things in just one, but the volume is difficult to adjust (it jumps when moving your feet). And tha Wah quality is very poor.	-1
Didn't work with my son's amp. Box has been thrown away. Idk if I can return this.	-1
Mic clip is not universal and the Nady that comes with it is terrible  However the stand itself is pretty sturdy but if you are planning on using any other mic you will need a mic clip and its not really the standard type (universal clips will NOT fit on it)	-1
I'm a professional podcaster and got this microphone to use doing my show standing up. Having the convenience of a stand was a HUGE appeal. Unfortunately, there is no USB attachment for me to plug this microphone into my Macbook. Therefore, I cannot try this for the stated reason I got the product yet. If the company could make a USB version of this microphone or provide some sort of attachment to make it work that way, then I'll upgrade the microphone.	-1
Sadly, I can't review the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non-responsive.  I tried the mic with other cables I have lying around that I know work, and I got nothing; it was like the mic wasn't plugged in at all.  And the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked.  I still tried it with a difference mic... static. I can't blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.  The stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package.  I was impressed at how much of is *isn't* plastic.  Still... I can't recommend this product.	-1
Ordered and recieved two. Both had a good stand but the microphone was broken. Agree with previous review, stand is worth about 20 dollars.	-1
Yamaha alway make good product, But seller shipping too long. I receive 2 week after ordred. My kid miss the concert, I have to go Guitar Center buy for him for the show. Now I have 2.	-1
Does not go high enough. Not for a tall person. I had to add an extra tube to make it higher. And I am 5.11	-1
for many who do not aspire too highly... for example, those that do NOT want to capture the sound of a good acoustic guitar played well in a good room, but if you are one of the many who are easily satisfied with...like, hey the guitar sounds good ! then, you will be very happy with these.  it is good for home use, for general listening, and connection to tv, etc... not bad for that ...  please LEARN how to place these.. never place any spkrs just ON a table.. experiment with mats, spikes, standoffs, etc... and WHERE to place them in your room, AWAY from WALLS please.  for us, these are not even close to real monitor spkrs, so we wish yamaha would please HONESTLY rename them accordingly... their OWN  MSP5  are getting a bit more closer to what the name Monitor aspires to....but alas, even the MSP5 are not true monitors...  but again, for MANY and most who are doing recordings in smaller home studios...we recommend the MSP5 over the yamaha HS series...  if you wish to Learn what a better monitor sounds like, and monitors are supposed TO REVEAL THE SOUNDS IN MOST FREQUENCIES CLEARLY and ACCURATELY, and not muddling them, first and foremost..that is why you need a monitor... then, go take a listen  at the Adam A7x...  ( adam a3x...hmmm...still debating on that...)  that might be a  good STARTING reference point..and then work your way back to yamaha... noting what you lose in sound....clarity and other things...  and, we might cause a Stampede here, but pls go Listen and then BUY the Fostex pm0.3 and the fostex pm0.4 These are QUITE A BIT  better than the HS series yamaha, ( in that they are SO SANE and CLEAR !!! )  and possibly you might like these two fostex over the yamaha MSP5 even ! and guess what,  these fostex are FAR cheaper too, altho with less amp power ,,,but CLEAN and honest, they are... of course, still very far from the likes of Adam a7x or the meyers ! ha !....  if your music does NOT require musical accuracy nor Truth, ( such things are VERY much required in a classical concert, etc )  and you go and use all sorts of effects and plugins anyway hey,yes, the yamaha is for you please ! you need all the bells and whistles you can find...heck, go and use any speaker you like by color even...sound clarity and truth to original signal are the last thing on your list...  however, yamaha is not totally un useable ..it will suffice for most of the so called music out there... where clarity is not crucial...and recording quality is not serious.  thanks	-1
Interface: Focusrite Saffire 6 USB Quality cables and mounts used and non-preamped other than the on-board preamp.  I do mostly guitar (acoustic and electric both mic-ed) and correlated vocal parts. Purchased this mic based on all the good reviews here and the price of course, but ended up NOT happy with it. I'll explain.  I have nothing higher end like Blue mics or Shure (no budget sadly), the only mic which I can do comparison with is my long used PC webcam's on-board stereo mic. So it is understandable that I expect better results after I put limited money into all the equipment along with this mic.  *This microphone Lacks Base, it lacks so much which led me to give it up.* I have a Seagull guitar which has a special resonance which generates a unique full-full sound. With this mic, details are great (met my expectation), but the sound signature was way lost! It sounds so thin and tiny, you can still hear "detailed" base, but half-powered to say the least. I born with a voice that is extremely mellow, non-distorted and not metallic (you get the idea), no matter how hard I practice. I can never use effects like delay and reverb which usually ruin my voice, otherwise it will just fade away and disappear in the backing track. This mic does quite the opposite. It cuts tremendous base from my voice, and, I ended up sound like a child (<10 years old). Even if I do music with more base (music made by older people like EC), I get the same disgusting results. That's not my voice! To record electric guitar, the playback is of course smaller and tinier than my amp, but I don't know if it is caused by the mic or it's the way it should be. I think both, hope someone can answer this. My interface is really good which provides more than required gain to the mic, so the mic is powered properly.  I played with it for sometime now (months), and tried countless times. So how is it compared with my webcam? Overall not as good. Why? My webcam sure can't handle more details and is unable to eliminate digital noise (both can't handle nature noise without noise cancelling with software), which this mic can. On the other hand, my webcam DOESN'T change the sound signature, it doesn't change the characteristics of the sound, which this mic does.  The good part about this mic is, it does as good as other reviewers said, *if and only if you just want to talk to YouTube*. In that's case, it is a cheaper solution. In my case, I'll save more and purchase something better (probably will be within the 100-200 USD range, will update).  I would not recommend this mic for any musical use, including vocal and instrumental. Other than that, consider it's a decent condenser mic, the price can't be beaten. It is no-doubt that this mic is a one star product to me, but just being nice and fair, you can still make use of it. Who knows, you get what you paid for. :)  Enjoy!	-1
This mic was not good at all for podcasting or broadcasting. It picked up ever sound from my typing on the keyboard to background noise.	-1
This is so cheaply made.	-1
This case can hold a great deal of hardware and everything about it is tough...except the wheels which are complete garbage. To me this is a very big deal when considering the weight of drum hardware. After 2-3 uses the rubber on the wheels separated from the plastic hubs making the case a static object. It's very frustrating dragging this thing around. I've tried to find a way to fix it but all attempts have failed. I depended on a hand cart for a year and a half until I finally bought a real road case. I wish I would have done that the first time because this expensive think is collecting spider webs now. Not a great investment at all. SKB is a great case company but this is a huge fail on their part.	-1
These cases are 5-Star quality, however the Amazon submission is a bit dodgy! Check out the Manufacturer's (SKB) site!  The illustrations shown on Amazon for this Mid-sized case (above) are for the MUCH larger SKB X-1 Large Drum Hardware Case, see the dimensions below. The X-1 Large case has the removable tray as shown here for the Mid-sized Case. The Mid-sized case has no such removable tray. The BIG visual give-away is the molded-in marks on the case.  The Mid-sized case has longitudinal ribs along the top and sides. You'll note that this Amazon item's illustrations depict "X"-shaped raised areas molded into the case top, sides, ends and probably the bottom as well. The Mid-sided case DOES have an extendable handle, similar to some suitcases and other equipment cases. The X-1 Large case illustrated here is SO tall that when stood on its wheels an extendable handle, as noted by Amazon, would extend to eye-level and beyond. That would be cute but hardly useful. This, as illustrated, X-1 Large case uses a D-Ring type handle which you can see in the illustrations provided by Amazon.  FYI: the Large case is about $310 retail and the exterior measures about 41"L x 18.5"W x 17.63"D. The Mid-sized case is about $160 retail and the exterior measures about 35.5"L x 16.75"W x 14.5"D. You can check out the INTERNAL Dimensions at the SKB site. Both are great cases BUT ... very different.  Buyer Beware!!!	-1
I ordered this with the frights fig pro but it has a different connector so I can't use it. Since I ran out if time to return since I didn't open right away.  I tried to use it with fog machine and it didn't work. I tossed it in the garbage where it belong.	-1
Not sure what I expected, but this wasn't it.  More like a wet soap machine.	-1
Completely non-intuitive to set up; takes at least five minutes of figuring out how each of the segments fit together each time I set it up.  Finally gave up and bought more expensive (and much better quality) stands.  Don't waste your hard-earned $ on this.	-1
I got one of these in a sale Behringer TPK984 pack of three pedals.  The price was so low that I got them out of curiosity, never having used Behringer stompboxes.  The compressor was the pedal in which I was most interested.  This pedal is supposedly a SMT adaptation of the Ibanez CP9.  In general, this Behringer compressor gets positive reviews, even among those who are not normally well-disposed toward the company's products.  The problem I encountered was that the "Sustain" pot had a terrific scratching right at the 4-5 o'clock position.  I returned the defective unit and got a new one from Amazon with the identical noise at the identical spot in the pot's rotation.  I don't know what to make of this.  In using effects for over forty years, I haven't encountered identically defective potentiometers.  Construction is not robust, and I find that changing batteries is pretty awkward and prone to having the unsecured pedal spring getting away.  Considering the recent increases in Behringer's prices and their continuing QC problems, I am not inclined to buy more of their products.	-1
Were great for a year, and then the soldered joints started failing, one after the other.  Had to resolder every one of these. Ended up throwing them away after a while and now use EWI instead.  These might work OK for home studio or install use. Not for weekend warriors. So far so good, here's hoping...	-1
First of all, GLS ES-58 is a good Mic for $30. For a standalone rating, it might receive 4 stars (no more). However, I put 2 stars here simply to warn people that, the rumor of "GLS ES-58 is a Shure SM58 Clone" is NOT TRUE.  The build quality of this unit is quite good. I cannot comment on the durability as I only had it for about 10 days.  The recording quality of this unit, however, is only acceptable. It cannot deal with mid-to-high level of volume. And this Mic tends to produce hyped (or overly bright) sound. It might work for some people, but for many trained speakers or singers, this would be quite annoying.  Again, for $30, GLS ES-58 clearly worth your attention. But it cannot reproduce the sound of a Shure SM58 regardless all the claims out there. I'd suggest to invest on a Shure SM58 instead.	-1
I bought this GLS Mic due to the rumor of "Shure SM58-clone", and had quite high expectations. However, it is not a Shure SM58.  I agree with some reviews that it's a very good Mic at $30 price point (good build quality as well, although I only had it for 1 week). But I strongly disagree with the comments that it records as high quality sound as the Shure SM58. It cannot handle mid-to-high volume at all. The sound is very bright comparing to the Shure SM58. And this unit is much easier to catch "echo-sounds" than the Shure SM58.  It might not be fair to give a 2 stars to this GLS ES-58 if the rating is entirely based on its performance (4 stars @ $30, and 3 stars @ $50). But given all the advertising of "Shure SM58-clone", I'd deduct some points to send the right message: This is far from a Shure SM58.	-1
after a year, it just stopped working. while it was working, though, it was awesome.	-1
One failed on me last night.  Light use for 6 months, taken care of.	-1
The microphone works decently but nothing really special I can say about it where I would notice the quality is  better that other less expensive ones.  My over rating is based more upon the shock mount which is of poor design and requires a pair of pliers and maybe a 14 inch monkey wrench to exaggerate the difficulty to tighten the swivel down. Typical of poor Chinese manufacturing which requires bribe paying to pass material through their own inspection.  The pop filter is also  totally worthless and should be eliminated from the package.  When Blue supplies inferior product to their microphone it cheapen the Microphone itself.  As I said the Mic works decently but equal to those costing a hundred less. It's the attachments that lower the value of the overall package. Even the cheap wooden Chinese box  which probably has hazardous chemicals in the stain.  Having worked for the federal Government and traveling as a tourist I noticed that toys that had been recalled from the US because of hazardous material are still being manufactured the same old way but now go through the bribe taking inspection officials and are being sold in the country.  Just because someone claims something is made in the US that is not necessarily true but you can make the claim if it assembled in the US.	-1
these are toys.  not for pro use.  The connectors fall apart, the boots don't stay tight, etc.  although I haven't had a big problem with it, I am suspicious of noise entrance into the shielding as it seems a little flimsy.  If you want bright colorful cables, well then these definitely fit that bill.	-1
Same sounds as the pod 2.0, but it sucks because it doesn't have knobs for every function, and the output is 3.5 mm instead of quarter inch. The quarter inch out is only going for a guitar amp and sucks if you use that for D.I. This is a crappy product. Get a pod 2.0, xt, or hd and skip this one.	-1
Having owned other Line6 hardware and having good experiences with this I bought this device to take to work and jam at on my lunch break.  I regret this decision....  First, the good things.  It sounds pretty decent if you like to play rock or metal.  Its not great, but for jamming along with your mp3 player and practicing it works perfect.  There are a ton of different sounds you can coax out of this device.  Other people have complained about the interface but I don't have any troubles with it.  There are some features you can't manipulate unless you plug it into a computer and use their software, doesn't bother me though.  Its portable and runs on batteries.  All you need is your guitar, cable, and headphones.  Back-lit screen is nice and legible.  The bad:  The modulation effects are pretty cheesy and digital sounding.  Eats batteries very quickly  Clean sounds are just meh, but if you aren't using it for recording it should be fine.  Here my main beef:  The build quality of this device is not up to normal Line6 standards.  It is very flimsy cheapo plastic.  I'm still wondering where the real Line6 device is because this seems like a crappy cheap Chinese copy of a Line6 device.  I dropped mine onto indoor carpeting and the screen cracked, making it unusable.  Line6 considers this device to be consumable and will not help you fix it.  They tell you to use their authorized service center to repair...ok, I contact every single one on the list and they all tell me the same thing, deal with Line6 directly.  So I try, and Line6 tells you to use an authorized service center... I don't like being treated like this and playing these games.  I broke it an am willing to pay for a repair but they just want me to buy a new one.  Heck, sell me a new screen and I will solder it in myself (I work in electronics).  No go.  Digitech never treated me this way with any of their products, in warranty or not.  If you buy this be extremely careful with it.  I'm not joking, this thing is flimsy.  Its not high impact plastic... its thin and fragile.  If you have an issue, good luck dealing with Line6.  In this economy you'd think they would do whatever it takes to maintain customers but I guess thats not the case.  Their business model must make them immune to these things.  I wanted to like this thing, I really did.  My old POD 2.0 is great and sturdy.  This pocket thing is an example of a great concept implemented very poorly.	-1
The Good:  This is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.  The Bad:  The tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise.  The cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied.  The effects are hit and miss as well.  Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.  Throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones.	-1
built rather cheaply	-1
These seem to like to fry after only being used a short time. I went thru three of them. thank god I don't use pedals anymore.	-1
For international 220V (bought is U.S.) use this power supply has bad ground or something causing a horrible load BUZZ. I confirmed it was the 1 Spot since a standard 220VAC power supply has virtually no noise So DO NOT BUY THIS FOR 220VAC USE. I visited their website and they do sell a 220 model with a ground. So it was the companies mistake wasting their time making this supply dual voltage. They should just made it 110VAC since they make 220VAC models. This would have also helped their reputation. Just saying...	-1
It will create a hum or buzzing sound even properly grounded. If I use all independent power supplies or batteries the signal sounds clean... But the daisy chain is useless if you want to sound good when you play... Specially when you plug in that last 8th pedal... It just sounds horrible... Of I knew I would have never bought this product.	-1
Didn't eliminate my pedal noise.	-1
Very bad channel noise, returned it no questions asked. Save your money for a real isolated power supply.	-1
It's a good ideal but the big problem I have is if Ya are using a tube Amp. ( have a 65' Twin Reverb Fender tube ) Ya get one HELL of a HUM. It's so bad I just can't use it at all. I'm not sure about a transistor Amp. but who uses those ????	-1
This is good for people who has tide budget. But the thing is, this thing just makes so much noise, so I returned it,	-1
When the pedal came in it looked perfectly fine but as soon as I plug it in a turn it on, it either chocked out my sound or made it hard to head. It makes my amp sound like someone clearing their throat. I don't know if it's that I need a noise gate or if it's that I got unlucky and got a bad pedal. But overall I'm still going to buy behringer products because so far every behringer product I've gotten so far has been excellent. I mean berheinger NR300 or their mixers have workerd great for me......just not this pedal	-1
no good	-1
Don't bother	-1
The pedal makes a signal noise when in the "off" position. I swear, Behringer is must be the German word for "Cheap"	-1
DOA...no good, out of the box,plug it, nothing.....no way to send it back (I`m not from the States)....meaning...I just wasted away $40 something bucks (add shipping)....  I did bought a Behringer pedal before (Tremolo/Pan) with good results, but I guess there`s two sides to this particular low economy pedals....  Well, I`ll man up and buy something else...	-1
Noise and noise.  I love to build cable myself and I strongly believe in my soldering skills as well.  The first cable that I've made, I've plugged in my Presonus 24 Mixer along with my Sennheiser E835, Sennheiser wireless D1, everything was quiet as it should be, I was happy. Then I started to build more and more cables with difference / customized length.  As soon as I plugged the cable I just made into my Presonus Mixer and GTD Audio G787L UHF, I started to hear the noise.  I was in doubt and thought about I might do the wiring wrong, I then verified with the previous cables I made, they are all identical.  I then pulled out my trusty Monoprice XLR bulky and heavy cable, plugged in between my GTD Audio G787L UHF and the mixer, things were super quiet again, swapped out with this cables, the noise started to hear from my Yamaha.  Plugged in with my Sennheiser E835, my Sennheiser D1 wireless mic with this GLS cable I made, it's quiet. Since the combination has not changed, only the cable, therefore this cable is no longer in my shopping list, or at least, if you think about the combination of GTD Auio and GLS Audio Cables, think again ...!	-1
Returned this after a few weeks.  At first, it was noisy.  Then, it stopped working.	-1
You get what you pay for.  Buy a good one.	-1
Don't waste your money, it sounds totally artificial	-1
dont wast your time behringer does have some pedals that are great but this one not so much	-1
POSSIBLY THE WORST INVESTMENT IVE MADE IN THE 27 YEARS IVE BEEN PLAYING BASS. CONSTANT CLICKING AND NOISE!!!!!! I BOUGHT A MARSHALL REGENERATOR TO REPLACE IT. THE MARSHALL KILLS THE BEHRINGER AS FAR AS EVERYTHING GO'	-1
I purchased this instrument brand new, on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that I simply could not ignore.  It was brand new, unopened, in box.  They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. In that environment I thought it a nice instrument.  However, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was VERY busy and noisy.  It's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.  This is indeed a 6-string ukulele.  It measures a bit over 28" top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke.  I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range.  The advantage to this of course is it's 6 string, so if you're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering.  ... that is of course, until you realize that while it has 6 strings, it is not tuned like a guitar.  It's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE.  One cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned.  Being a total newbie to ukes, this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions.  So my primary purpose in purchasing this-- to have a small portable guitar, hit a snag.  Now that's not totally the end of the thing, because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning.  It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup.  So all is not lost there.  It was just an unexpected surprise-- mainly because I didn't research the instrument prior to purchase (it's rare that I impulse buy).  So tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument.  That's where the Yamaha really falls short.  This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand.  There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box.  That this was a "rush job" out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.  There are no strap pegs; those will require being added by hand (not difficult, but extra expense and time).  The action is of course too high.  That's not unusual-- in truth it's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise.  But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.  However, the thing that bothers me the most:  if I wasn't aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele... I'd think it's was a cheap knock-off child's guitar.  There's not one thing about this instrument that says "quality"-- which is quite disappointing.  This instrument sells for about $100.  That low cost is obvious.  This is a "cheap guitar" in every way.  I can't honestly say it's a toy, but it reeks "beginner instrument".  The tuners are as cheap as they come,  the finish is cheap, there is no decoration, no protective edging. The finish is-- unfinished.  I bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon-- and I respect those reviews.  People have different tastes and for some folks this has a "home made" feel that they will love.  However I've been playing guitar for (mumblety mumble) deca...uh... years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap.  I own two Ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass, a hand-made violin and an Epiphone electric uke (which is of such higher quality it's not even a contest. And no I'm not hawking Epiphone.  Facts is facts, that's all.  You can read my very-positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon).  When I got this  home and took a good look at it, I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship, nothing that said anything more than "this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible".  In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.  Other than those two factors, one can find $40-$50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality.  The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice-- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke.  Other than its portability, I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price... consider it over-priced (or rather, under-made).  One must grant it's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation.  But low quality is low quality.  (Edit two weeks later:  I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store-- a direct competition to this instrument.  The Cordoba is MUCH nicer.  It's built better, has better sound, and is finished out much more nicely.  Sorry Yamaha, but facts is facts.  Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side, I'd have bought and kept the Cordoba.)  That's my honest review.  I know some will disagree.  But others know exactly what I mean.  This isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. However-- I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom.  As mentioned, the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.  Fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it.  I simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are.	-1
I bought this with high hopes as I play both ukulele and guitar (Kamaka uke and Ramirez guitar) I have a need for a little backpack instrument and Yamaha is exceptional at its price in its lower line classical guitars.  Unfortunately, this instrument has very poor fretting and intonation even compared to a lower priced ukulele.  It is marginally acceptable for first position chords, but if finger picking or classical guitar or ukulele is your thing, you will be very disappointed.  Also, the frets are very cramped, more than either of my ukuleles and very hard to play, and I have very small hands. Construction is good at its price point but it has little resonance; again a medium priced uke sounds better. The neck needs a complete redesign and the instrument should be revoiced. A good guitarlele such as that built by KoAloha is about a thousand dollars so I was probably expecting too much.	-1
I heard great things about the S6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, I bought it based upon reviews. I've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:  - The Seagull is comparatively unattractive. Its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar. - The cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice. - The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less "alive"/resonant during playing. - The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr. - The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition. - The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy. - The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK. - The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I've not encountered before. - I can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!  All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. In fact, for the price range, I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, Sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.  I don't regret getting it, but I feel like I overpaid for what I received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. Seagull to me is over-hyped. Thanks for reading!	-1
every time you move, you will hear noise. It's amazing actually. i don't know how these people got away with getting them to production. Couldn't make it work, as much as I loved the look and functionality of not having chords everywhere. Fail.	-1
This is a seriously long and very flexible cable. In fact, its' the most flexible cable I've ever used. That may lead to a little tangling issues later on, but I am pretty careful with my gear; it's mostly only used within the confines of my home studio. Compared to the Rotosound curly cables, I would say I prefer the brighter sonic qualities of this Koilcord a little more; not that it's better, just a different sound that I prefer. That being said this cable was a bit more than the Rotosounds.  The thing I like most about this cable is that is not noticeable when I am walking around. It stays out of the way like a curly should as it moves and bounces very freely. It has a good amount of lead on the line before it stars curling so that makes it a little easier to hook through the strap(photo included). I only wish that this standard model cable(as opposed to the premium line) came in black as well, but that's not really a concern for me.  **UPDATE** this cable has become extremely microphonic in a short amount of time. It was nice while it lasted but it's just not usable anymore.	-1
This pickguard did not fit my Fender P bass, it would not fit over the standard pick ups without having to file the pickguard. screws line up but won't fit right... maybe the problem is there are so many P basses out there...squier..mexican ..american..etc and this description was too vague.	-1
This peddle doesn't have much middle ground . There's nothing or all , All being to much , It almost sounds like Flange at top end . I also Have to pick between A and B witch One  will work that day . Lets not even speak about the Battery placement . I thought it would be great on a acoustic Guitar , I was wrong .It will work on an electric ;but what sound you will get I don't know .	-1
stay away	-1
Cuts into the top end of your tone no matter what. Some say it's subtle but it made it unusable to me.	-1
I'm a longtime Boss fan, I have and love several of their pedals. The Chorus Ensemble, several of their OD & Distortion pedals, the DD-7 Delay, and a few others I rotate in on rare occasion. If I could only choose pedals from one company it would definitely be from Boss. I even like how they feel and look.  WITH THAT SAID, there is no longer any reason to buy this particular pedal new. At its price I highly recommend spending a little more on an ISP Decimator II or even the original Decimator. It doesn't siphon off tone like this Boss pedal does, and is much tighter as a downward expander/noise cutter.  First test: One of my guitars is a Warmoth Strat, with a fairly buzzy set of Texas Special single coil pickups. Run it through an OD or two and it's BZZZZZ. Perfect testbed. No contest, the ISP cleaned it all up while NS-2 was just a mediocre gate.  Second test: Metal chug test on a Schecter with EMGs through a Super Distortion through a Mega Distortion on full blast. LOL, not close. ISP kills it.  I know a lot of pedals and music gear are subjective, and everybody thinks their thing is the best, but I'm telling you the ISP is so much better. To the point where I would flat-out disbelieve anyone who says they tried them both and still liked the Boss better. You might find this used for $40 (significantly less than what used Decimator I pedals go for) and that would make sense I guess.  It's had a good run for me and just about everyone else, but this is 1995 tech and it shows. Please at least compare the two at a Guitar Center for yourself before pulling the trigger. Thank me later.	-1
Don't get it unless you broke	-1
Meh.  But It's not terrible.  I would recommend this as a practice pedal where tone isn't terribly important, but high gain is preferred.  I would never gig with this as the housing is all plastic.  It just sounds pedal-y.  But for the money, it's ok.  I bought this because it was cheap and I was curious.  I ran it through three amp straight, no post processing or recording.  Meh.	-1
I just don't like it. It's cheaply made with a terrible sound.	-1
Terrible sounding piece of cheap junk.	-1
Not the greatest quality. Doesn't sound nearly as good as what my line 6 spider IV can put out	-1
All fizzle no sizzle	-1
First thing I did was try to load a battery.  I don't want to use a power supply.  It was impossible to load the battery, and hey, I'm real good at figuring out the impossible.  OK, so there's plenty of good reviews here, any problems like this?  The instructions say "To install or replace the 9V battery, press the hinges with a ballpen and remove the pedal cover."  OK, so I'm supposed to do that in the middle of a gig?  I don't think so.  Those instructions make no sense whatsoever.  I then took it apart, but you cannot access the battery that way.  In the trash it went. No point in trying out something if you can't change out the battery.  I've had pedals and pedals, but never had a problem like this.  A bad design, that's for sure.	-1
Does not work right. Only one knob makes a difference.	-1
Not worth buying imo, something on the inside broke within a couple of weeks and it won't work now	-1
It sounds very artificial, I remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had, now that I use it with a better amp, it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it's not even worth the price I payed for it before. I also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn't want to lock with my guitar cable and when I took it apart, there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced. Shitty pedal.	-1
I bought this unit for a friend, and I could compare with others overdrives I already have. I think the MXR Badass Custom Modified Overdrive or Way Huge Green Rhino are better choise.	-1
Bought the classical guitar version.  Very slim and light.  Too small to fit well on classical guitar neck.  Closed tension is very weak.  Strings buzz, No way to get a clean clear sound.  Looks different than pictured on the Amazon site and Packaging says 'performance 2'.	-1
Don't let the double braced legs fool you. When they say Lightweight,...they mean lightweight!  Super flimsy, and even a bit noisy (tubes rattle inside)  I tried putting an 18" zildjian cymbal on this and it continued to sway back and forth. It's probably OK for beginners with small  cymbals up to 14",  or a towel rack....but more than that, I think you're chancing damage from collapse.  "Gone are the days of Tama Titans!"  If you're looking for a heavy duty medium size boom,...look at the Yamaha CS-865.  The 800 series stands are solid and built for road use.  They're twice the price,..but it pays to do it right the first time!  I should take my own advise!!	-1
not great quality	-1
My copy does not sit flat on the floor, it wobbles. The wobble is most pronounced at the lowest height settings, diminishing as the height is increased. This happens regardless of which toothed disc the upper arms are attached to. (The two discs allow the reversing of the upper arms. The arm assembly may need to be reversed for best balance, depending on the height the stand is set at.) Note: I have a Quick-Lok keyboard stand that solves wobble problems by employing eccentric feet that can be rotated to compensate for an imperfect stand or uneven floors. Simple and clever.  This stand does not adjust finely enough to hold an amp in a level position, a major reason for its purchase. It gets close, but the locking teeth lack enough adjustment resolution to dial it in.  Please note that Amazon's image of this product apparently shows the upper part of the rack rotated to an incorrect position. (Perhaps that's because instructions are not included.) The cross-brace should be under the amp.	-1
I unpacked mine and 20 minutes later I packed it up for return.  The two cylinders at the base of the stand were out of alignment, so the stand rocks back and forth - like a table with one leg shorter than the other.  I tried this on several floor surfaces and at different angles. The misalignment is serious too, and not good for holding a cabinet with a loudly vibrating speaker or two.  I can see that the six previous reviewers like this product, so hopefully I was just unlucky enough to get the bad one of the bunch.  Nevertheless, you deserve to know and as for me, I am now going to shop locally for this item.	-1
These cables introduced hum into every sound system I tried them on. Useless. At first I thought it was my system but I tried it out on others and hum was introduced. I have since replaced the cables with another brand and the hum is gone.	-1
Stand is flimsy and falls over easily when I have one banjo in it. Also, two guitar head stocks will end up hitting each other: the supports don't go out far enough to avoid your two guitar necks touching each other. I regret this purchase	-1
Guess I should have looked at the sizes before ordering, this is too small too fit on my pinky.  Not even close.	-1
To small to be useful.	-1
to small for my finger.	-1
Kind of hard to tell from the pic, but the 2 bottom rests do not fold away, nor are they permanently affixed. I don't have time to assemble a guitar stand every time I play a gig. Additionally, the stand is not what I consider sturdy and when you have 2 guitars on it the heads touch each other. Poor design, in my opinion.	-1
This product did not come with assembly instructions, but it is pretty straightforward to assemble,  The top is very well made (metal construction painted black) and easily adjusts to accommodate a wide variety of mixer sizes.  The problem is the base.  The base is made of cheap gray plastic.  I could get past that if was the correct size for this stand - it is not.  The coupling does not attach to the base at all and comes out easily.  The coupling is also too large for the stand and with only one tightening bolt, it will not stand up straight once you put the weight of the mixer in it.  I put a couple wraps of black duct tape around the base which helps, but is still not very sturdy.	-1
----------Hohner Blues Harp: -(**___) overall: This is the harmonica I own that I don't enjoy playing. The redeeming quality is the Blues Harp sounds very good, enough to compete with any harmonica in its price range. However the metal covers protrude and are sharp on the lips, making it simply too uncomfortable to be any good. -(****_) Sound: Excellent. This is the strength of the Blues Harp. Sounds as good as any great harmonica in this price range. -(*____) Comfort: The most uncomfortable harmonica I have played, bad enough that I make sure to stay away. This is a thick harmonica, but the problem is with the coverplates protruding over the wood comb. This means the lips press and slide against two sharp pieces of metal, creating increasing discomfort the longer the harmonica is played. -(**___) Playability: The protruding coverplates make it harder to get a tight seal. The wood comb is not smooth and the holes have sharp edges, so the harmonica does not slide smoothly. The positive note is I didn't have excessive gapping issues with any individual reeds or any being excessively out of tune (I test all my harmonicas with a tuner) -(**___) Durability: Durability is the weakness of Hohner overall, no surprise here. -(***__ Aesthetics): Perfectly average. Looks similar to a marine band. Does not have the appeal of a Suzuki.  -----------Comparison with other mid-price Harmonicas (lowest to highest score) --(**___ overall) Hohner Big River: Nothing memorable. It's perfectly fine but there's no reason to buy it over the Special 20 (the $ savings is minimal). Unlike the Special 20 it has a wood comb, but if you want a wood comb buy a Marine Band. --(***__ overall) Hohner Marine Band 1896 Classic: The longtime favorite of many players, undisputed best for decades and, in my opinion, still the best wood-comb harmonica at the mid-price range. Many pros still use it, but don't be fooled, they are likely to be custom-assembled custom-tuned custom-polished. At mid-price range it has my (slightly) favorite sound, but the Special 20 and Lee Oskar are significantly more comfortable and their holes are easier for a beginner to single out. --(****_ Overall) Hohner Special 20: This and the Lee Oskar are the best in terms of comfort and ease of play. The plastic comb protrudes, making it extremely comfortable and smooth to use. The sound is great. Durability is terrible. The case is more durable than the Lee Oskar one. --(****_ Overall) Lee Oskar Major Diatonic: Excellent harmonica, extremely comfortable, great sound. Just as good as the Special 20. In fact, the two are so similar I struggle to find a meaningful difference. The Lee Oskar feels slightly thicker on the lips because of the way the coverplates are rounded. Ultimately I chose the Lee Oskar: It has a better reputation for durability, so at this price range it is my preferred harmonica. One downside is the plastic case can break within a month from normal daily opening/closing.  ---------- High end Harmonicas: --(***** Overall) Suzuki Firebreath, Suzuki Promaster, Suzuki Olive, Seydel Noble: Amazing. All of these are better than the mid-priced harmonicas reviewed above. However they are not cheap, so I recommend the Lee Oskar as a first harmonica until you decide you're going to stick with the instrument. Even if you're "sure" you'll stick, I still recommend starting with the Lee Oskar because beginners are more likely to misuse and break their harmonicas, and so you get the pleasure of looking forward to and appreciating your future upgrade. --(*****The Best*****) Antony Dannecker Optimus (custom harmonica): Simply the best, comes at a price. Antony is great and very available if you want to discuss any particular tweaks to your custom harmonica. Off-the-shelf can't compare.  ----------Note on the 2-draw: 1-2-star reviews often complain their 2-draw was broken from day one. The 2-draw most likely is not broken, it is simply a very difficult note for beginners to play.  ----------Note on which key to buy first: --Start with a key of C. This is the accepted standard since most beginner songs and lessons will all be in C. One harmonica is fine as a beginner. --Then: A, D, G A is common in blues and country. D is also common. G is often used when playing along with guitar. --Then Bb, F, E,... here is gets more debatable  ---------- If any edit would improve the review quality/thoroughness/clarity write me a comment.	-1
Cheap junk. I gambled and lost on this one. It was too much of a pain to pack it up and return it. I paid so little for it that I couldn't be bothered. If you are thinking you'll check it out with the hope it will actually be good, forget it. I did that and now you don't have to. Spend more money and get one that works well. This would be fine as a TOY for a kid to use.	-1
This cable is mediocre at best. For the price it's okay, but it's noisy when used with powered speakers. Other imported brands on Amazon perform a lot better and feel more sturdy than this flimsy.	-1
I really don't know how this mic got any high star marks ! It's a bad wired mic and a worse wireless microphone. Tried to connect it to powered speakers but way to much feedback and distortion to even hear my voice. Please don't be fooled for the price. Or you might get stuck with a mic that even a pawn shop will only give you 5 bucks for or turn you away. The microphone itself works when wired via XLR cable but sounds a bit cloudy and muted. Which is also the only positive of the product, it comes with a long 15ft. XLR cable to 1/4 jack. I'm a Dj .. Not a pro, but I know you can do better than this product please.	-1
S***ty ---	-1
Terrible build quality, will ruin your recordings. I picked up two of these because of the high ratings and mostly positive reviews and can only imagine either the reviewers have little experience with sound recording or these are their first cables. They feel cheap, they sound cheap, they don't even smoothly fit into popular mics like a Bluebird. I wouldn't care if they felt like they'd fall apart in my hands if they at least sounded alright but they don't and if your music is hard to listen to these cables definitely play a part. Even if you're just starting out and on a tight budget do yourself a favor and but some good quality cables (Mogami, Canare), these cables will only make the path to your goal more difficult.	-1
This got good ratings so I bought one.  When I got it, I noticed that it felt cheaper than my other XLR cables.  It has an electric short, where the cable connects to the XLR female adapter.  When I touch the back of the microphone, where the cable connects, and the stand, it makes a humming sound.  My other XLR cables do not have this problem.  I returned it for a refund.	-1
never got a chance to use  got wrong product just kept what i received	-1
The Jack's are too long and have dirt (Actual Dirt!!) As insulators on the tips!!  (See photo the one on the right is 1/8" too long they don't work!!)	-1
Not great quality cables... Some did not work! You get what you pay for!	-1
HIGH PRICE FOR INACCURACY!!!  Who was dictating the sound of the Fender deluxe when BOSS made this mistake?? I own TWO Fender Delux Reverb Amps and this box don't sound like EITHER! You know-two amps, exactly the same, NEVER sound the same! This pedal doesn't sound like any amp I've ever heard!  Save your money-buy a vintage speaker FOR LESS than HALF THE PRICE, pop it into your cabinet and you will be closer to YOUR TONE than with this pedal!!	-1
I read all the glowing reviews on this unit, and unfortunately bought one based on those. This unit will  kill your tone, and best place I can see for this unit is trash can. I was not expecting a Fender Deluxe tube amp but some improvement on my guitar amp combo (Fender American Strat and Fender 65R transistor amp). First of all you cannot get a clean tone, because if you turn the gain all the way off, no sound. If you turn the gain little you get distortion no clean sound. OK. So it does not simulate a clean Fender Deluxe amp tone at all, so how about tube distortion. What you get not tube distortion like sound, but horrible artificial electronic noise (I rather call it non-musical noise). OK, so you do not get tube distortion either, how about reverb? It has that annoying ping pong sound even at lowest levels of reverb, so reverb is totally useless also. I have Fender spring reverb on my amp, and this reverb does not even sound remotely close. As a physics person I know all about spring reverb, as I had one in my lab, believe me I know how it works. How about vibrato (tremolo)? It has the worst vibrato (tremolo), most artificial one I have ever heard. Totally useless. I have Digitech R155, and its Fender Amp simulation, tremolo, and Fender reverb simulation is light years better than this unit, and it costs less, and it has a drum machine, does so much more than this unit. So forget Fender clean tone, Fender tube distortion, Fender reverb, and Fender vibrato (tremolo); what is left? This unit is not only totally useless, but it will kill any tone you have without it. My biggest shock, is Fender let their name associated with this unit, it is an insult to Fender amp legacy. Please Fender, disallow your name to be abused in this way, no matter how much Boss is paying you. My advice is get Digitech R155 for less money; far better Fender like sounds including tube simulation. Or better yet, save your money to get Fender Floor Mustang effects unit which is closest thing you can get to the real Fender amp sounds. (that is what I bought).	-1
Pros: - Many cool effects like vinyl slowdown and phaser delay. - Display shows what effect is selected. - Tap tempo and auto tempo. - Built-in recorder. - Can slow down and speed up MP3s using touch slider.  Cons: - The micro switches under the buttons on the sides are flimsy and prone to break off with minimal pressure. - It can store three favorites but the memory is cleared if the batteries are low or not installed. - It loads only one MP3 into memory at a time. It doesn't have a playlist so cannot be used as an MP3 player. - It uses mini stereo jacks for input and output making it difficult for professional purposes. It should have standard 1/4" ins and outs. - Body is made of thin plastic and is not robust (unlike the mini KP which is better built). - Doesn't save last selected effect when turned off.  [DW]	-1
Until this hour did not come	-1
Not a bad pedal IF it didn't have a background hum. It is very distinctive and obvious. No wonder the guy I bought it off sold it.	-1
i tried this instrument in a local store, but the one i got is hissy and doesn't sound as good. I'm really diappointed, because now i am also going to have to buy a noise reducer. i sure hope that helps.	-1
I picked this up from Sweetwater and returned it a week later. Noisy and hissy. Of the 4 modes, the piezo was the only one I could use on bass. Since I'm not a guitar player, I hooked it up to a friend's Marshall practice amp and it was still noisy and hissy. Very disappointed.	-1
Summary Acoustic sounds "ok", but noisy in weird ways. I returned it. Price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.  Pros - Boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable - standard 9V power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs. - variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)  Cons - fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords) - generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain - While I have several Boss pedals, I think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.  Details: The basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. It wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. It was also just noisy in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. However, I sold that model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound. At the time, the AC-2's were selling for about $85 new. Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC-3.  I bought the AC-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC-2 -- and they did, a little. But not enough to keep it. I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. I think the AC-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.  I opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead. They make two -- a "300" and a "400". The 400 has reverb on the pedal. I opted for the 300 and got it for $25. I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case. However, this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Boss....if it breaks...I'll just buy another.  I also have a Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit. You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC-3. The least cost effective of those choices is the AC-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.  I'm not saying its a bad pedal, I'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. If they would fix the noise issues, I might have even kept it. I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times I'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. This Boss pedal just didn't work that well for me.	-1
Pretty good sounding pedal overall, I really was wanting to use it more, but the hissing sound it generates is more then I can handle. Ebay here we go.	-1
I bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage.  I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D-28, but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.  Imagine my profound disappointment.  Really, Boss??? This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours.  This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the "Top" control higher than about 9 o'clock.  At first I thought I must have a defective unit, but then I started reading reviews on-line.  Seems like it is part of the design. It's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. Totally unusable, as far as I'm concerned. By the way, I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat).	-1
These do not have a long shelf life.  I have had 3 go bad on me now over the years.  For no reason either.  Look into buying something of higher quality.	-1
This is definitely a budget item. If you want a good sound card please spend more money. The sound is very pour..	-1
I purchased this unit and it was several weeks before I had a chance to use it.  1. The software would not install. 2. I downloaded the newest version of software from Newmark and it installed fine. 3. There is no output from the RCA output jacks.  In order to get tech support from Newmark you fill out an online form and wait 24-72 hours for a response. I have done this 3 times and have not received any response from them.  In the meantime, 30 days have passed and I have lost the opportunity to return the unit.  I called the Newmark online store (you can buy from them, but I did not) and explained the situation. They told me they would put me through to their tech support. I waited on-hold for 25 minutes and every 30 seconds listened to a recorded message saying that I could go to their website for help - www dot ionaudio dot com. Newmark does not even support their own product!  After 25 minutes I talked to a person who said that they don't actually provide support but would take my name and number and have someone call me. I asked what would happen if I was not home when they called - "You will need to call this number back again."  This is nuts.  I called Newmark and talked to a customer service rep, told him about the experience and asked if they could replace the unit. He said they would not. When I asked why not he said, "Because you didn't buy it from us. You gave your money to someone else." I was boiling by this point. I replied, "You don't stand behind your product if it is bought from one of your retailers?" He said, "Of course we do. I can connect you with technical support."  "Will it be the same technical support I was connected to last time, waited on hold for 25 minutes, then told someone would call me back, but if I miss the callback I have to start all over again?"  "Yes."  Make your own decision. I will never ever again consider buying a Newmark product.	-1
The manufacturer has begun sending me E-Mail.  If you value your privacy, you'll avoid all GLS Audio products.	-1
This didn't work very well for my 88 key keyboard (Yamaha P-200). It sat on the stand OK but the slidable knobs on the stand never really get to a sweet spot on the keyboard. The result is a less than sturdy situation. The stand itself is fairly sturdy, but unless your keyboard has a flat bottom, I don't think you'll like it. I have a double braced X stand that my Yamaha has been on. It has slid front to back a little on that stand, but the stand is otherwise rock solid. I can't say the same for this stand. I ended up returning the item.	-1
junk	-1
WORST GUITAR EVER! DOESNT MAKE ANY REAL MUSIC NOTES. SAVE UR MONEY AND BUY A FENDER SQUIER OVER THIS CRAP.	-1
just buy a cheap guitar instead.  can't tune it,  fretboard all warped,  the only good thing is that it is all plastic and good for toddlers.	-1
The entire guitar is plastic.  I bought it to replace my old wooden one but it's all plastic.  So the sound is different, the feel is different.  If you are looking for a wooden guitar- this is not it.  It's more of a novelty item than my old wooden one- which I loved and recorded with and played everyday.	-1
Cheep product !  Would not Recomend To A Friend !!!  F+	-1
No good, a true toy	-1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/First-Act-Discovery-Acoustic-Guitar-FG127/dp/B000S8CX7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">First Act Discovery Acoustic Guitar - FG127</a>  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S8CX7M?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_  This product is very bad. First time I got and found that the strings did not retain the tension and sere loosened in 2 hours giving dumb noise. I had to tune the guitar every qp minutes when it was played. Hence, I placed order for replacement. That was worst than first one. The second one could not sound as the second and third string was touching the staff once they were tightened, I will recommend not to purchase this guitar for any reason.	-1
You get what you pay for.  My Grandson's first guitar.  Doesn'the stay tuned but what can you expect?	-1
These are built poorly even in the sense they are toys for kids.  Awful quality.	-1
You get what you pay for.  This is nothing more than a toy.  I bought this is some other guitars to give away at Christmas to needy families.  I play guitar and you can't really play these.  They will not tune to normal tuning.  I you are just looking for a first toy guitar for your child, this is great.  Otherwise, spend a hundred bucks and buy an Epiphone DR100 and start them off with a nice guitar.	-1
Complete waste of money.  You can get one for $15 of the same cruddy quality - not even useful for making music.  It's basically a toddler's strumming toy.  It's 100% plastic, not counting the strings.  Buzzing all over the fretboard.  If you want a toy, amazon has them for $15.  If you want something that can actually play a song, pay a little more for the Lauren LA30N.  It's not that much of a step up but it can get the job done for someone who wants to learn to play and is younger than say 7yrs.  The nylon strings will require repetitive retuning.  For a more serious student, you should move up to a 3/4 size guitar.  Yamaha is just one brand that is available here but it's >$100.  There is really no option for a sub $100 student guitar.	-1
I'm terrified by the positive reviews here.  Yes, it works fine as a toy to bang around on and will satisfy people who don't need or want to be in tune.  However, for anyone serious about actually learning, there will be nothing here but frustration.  It will not hold tuning for any length of time.  Being able to hold tuning, and being playable, are so important for learners.  I had fun banging around on this, but I had to tune it after every song.  That's fine for me, because I'm experienced and fast at it.  For someone just starting out, they will be learning to tune, and it would be extremely frustrating with something like this.  I understand the desire for something as inexpensive as possible to make sure a student is going to stick with it, but getting something that doesn't stay in tune is setting up an obstacle in their path that may ensure that they will NOT stick with it.  I guess buying this would be a good way to discourage someone.  :(	-1
The guitar I received was made of plastic.  I was not able to tune it.  It was definitely not the quality it was described to be at the time of purchase.  It was described as a wooden guitar and it is all plastic, very poor quality and I am very disappointed.	-1
I've never actually played this guitar, but I feel I must warn people about First Act.  I've been teaching guitar for over 30 years, and I've seen lots of crappy guitars in my life, but First Act makes the crappiest guitars ever.  Crappier than Hanna Montana, crappier than Starcaster (not to be confused with Stratocaster), crappier than those Esteban guitars, and that is saying something.  If you want an uber-affordable yet playable electric guitar, get a Squier.  If you want an uber-affordable yet playable small-size acoustic guitar for a small-size kid, get a nylon-string Romanian guitar, such as Amigo.	-1
most failed after a short period of time. couldn't depend on them.	-1
It didn't work on my Les Paul.  My G, B and sometimes high E string tend to stick.  The Lil Luber didn't help at all...sticks just the same.  Going back to graphite...	-1
...yep just like rice krispies?  I have a pretty long pedal chain but get a lot crackle in the mid range my boss volume.  Tried repeatedly to contact boss on this problem but apparently they don't care.  In fact you can't get a hold of them except over their website and they don't answer!  So I'll change the sealed pot myself and eat the cost.  Gave it two stars cause I like  the direct tuner out and sturdy construction.  Boss like many big companies have lost touch with reality.  Tick off enough customers you go out of business cuz only an idiot is a repeat customer for abuse.  How's that old saying go, mess me around once shame on you, mess me around twice shame on me.  :~[	-1
The electronics work well for me but this thing is taking up huge real estate on the pedal board.  Also,  the casing around the jack get in the way of right angle patch cables.	-1
well... I thought the negative reviews had been written by very picky people, or unfortunate ones who had received a faulty unit. Nop. It's a piece of crap. REally. Stay away from this. For the first month or so, it worked somewhat fine, only thing was that it took the tuner a few seconds to "hear" a string had been plucked. Now, however, it doesn't hear my sixth string at all. I'm about to throw it away.	-1
Tuner is off, there is no indication whether the tuner mode is enabled, or mute is enabled (the LED light on mine is stuck on all the time). Unfortunately, that's what you get with Behringer; sometimes you get a good piece of equipment that lasts forever, sometimes it's junk out of the box and you're stuck with it.	-1
junk, refunded.	-1
This pedal is crap...  I have a Boss Chromatic Tuner and it is more responsive and holds the display up longer...  With this pedal, I have to hit the string a couple times, then it lights up, then the display goes away after a second or two...  You can spend $20 on a tuner from planet waves and it is a much better tuner than this.  I bought this to have it in a second pedal board (the Boss Chromatic is in my first)....  I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT....  Save your money, buy ANYTHING ELSE....	-1
Didn't work well for either of my basses, active or passive. Gave up, shouldn't be that hard to tune.	-1
Worked for a few months perfectly and then stopped.  Now the lights just bounce around and the tuner is no help at all.  Replacing with Boss tuner	-1
HAVE TO REMOVE ALL CABLES OR BATTERY WILL DIE	-1
Noisy, not worth it at any price. Cant read it on stage.	-1
Junk. Don't waste your money.	-1
After waiting forever I finally received. The packing was damaged. The unit doesn't work correctly. Doesn't stay on.	-1
I had two of these within the past year and neither work now.	-1
eats batteries, at first i thought i left the chord plugged in, so i replaced the battery, tuned my guitar, unplugged all chords, battery was dead after 3 days.	-1
Don't bother with this pedal if you plan on attaching to multiples. Poor signal, if any. It's worth the extra $30-$40 for a decent quality pedal.	-1
Don't waste your money.  Takes about an hour to warm up to the point of being able to tune anything, and after a week it developed a high pitched feedback.  When warmed up it's response is very slow, impossible to use in a live situation.	-1
OK I need a tuner and I need one fast I ignored all of the review, it works great on guitar but if you use it on a bass it won't even read the Low B string I use Dr Red Devil Bass Strings and It won't read the Low B or The E at all in Chromatic Mode, Also I found that this tuner takes several seconds to start registering when using it on a bass, The LED is externally bright and hard to read what note your in, When I put the tuner in Bass mode it doesn't even tell you what note your in it only says the NUMBER of the string? YES thats right Only tells you what number and only tunes to standard.....But if you play a 5 string Bass DO NOT PURCHASE this because it just will not work, not with pitch harmonic, not by tuning from the 12 or the 24th fret NOTHING...I would send this thing back to Amazon if I hadn't have lost the box....Some say its worth 20 bucks...Honestly it isn't, I wouldn't even give this tuner to a beginner......	-1
This looks like the original but is a cheap piece of garbage. 90% of the time when I turn it on it just makes some low-frequency croaks and creaks and then goes silent. Other times it works for a few seconds and then back to the croaks and creaks. It's a nice display piece, especially for Kraftwerk fans, but don't expect to actually use it.	-1
These are insanely inexpensive. Kudos to the people who source these and bring them to market. Unfortunately, I am one of the unlucky purchasers who gets a nonworking unit on the first try. I am sending it back. It looks really nifty and has a great instruction manual, but doesn't make any sound whatsoever. I tried with various batteries, all brand-new.  I will now begin the process of exchanging for a different one; hopefully this will be easy and I will be able to update this review with something more tantalizing than this report ....	-1
Just received this item today.  Unscrewed the back plate to put in 3 AA batteries.  Turned it on.  Immediately discovered two keys broken.  No sound at all from the high A and the high D sounded a D# instead.  I know it's just a toy, but I purchased it with full intention of using it on recordings.  It doesn't really come with three different organ sounds, but three octaves of the same organ sound.  The lowest one sounds best.  Vibrato is decent, not great.  Anyway, since mine came conveniently pre-broken, I'll be returning it.  Not sure if I'm interested in trying another one at this point or just going to get a refund.  This was disappointing.	-1
I used to own a samson Airline wireless guitar system as well as one of their older model wireless headsets.  I was very fond of the unites that came out about 10 years ago because they worked well, had exceptional range, and weren't tied down with cumbersome belt packs.  When I saw this new wireless headset, I was extremely excited that the design really hadn't changed much, but did look as though it had gone through some upgrades.  So it was with a great deal of excitement that I opened up my new wireless headset for use in my work as a professional musician.  The headset was comfortable as I remembered, and the unit connected with no issues.  Aside from having to play with the squelch nob a bit to take care of some feedback, things were looking good.  But when I turned off the headset, the receiver immediately started making a very loud static hiss through my pa system.  I was very dismayed, and tried turning the unit on and off, checking for any other way to resolve this issue, but to no avail.  I immediately checked the knowledge base online and discovered that other folks had had this exact issue, and there seemed to be mo appropriate resolve besides resetting the squelch.  If that failed, most folks said it was a defect in the unit and that in most cases this could be revolved by swapping out the unit.  So I gave it a shot.  Let me just say at this point, that Amazon, as the retailer who handled this issue, could not have an EASIER, more seamless system for making the exchange I have ever seen, and I have worked in retail for over 10 years.  Thank you, Amazon, and if you folks are reading this, I'd come work for you ANYTIME!  Anyway.  I received my new unit the next day, and took it out of the box to test it.  I encountered the exact same issue, and though I tried several different things, the problem persisted.  As a professional musician, with my reputation on the line every time I go out on stage, I do not have time for this sort of issue. If a product comes to me with an issue, I will always give the manufacturer a chance, but two strikes and you are out is what I live by.  I am VERY disappointed this product did not work correctly for me, and would appeal to Samson to fix the issue.  I will, unfortunately, out of necessity be purchasing a different wireless headset.	-1
The point of this (for me) was to use it as an A/B pedal with my Vox AC30... send the signal into both the clean and boost channels, and be able to switch between them at the kick of a pedal.  One of the only big gripes with the Vox is that the clean and boost volumes aren't really able to be controlled independently (at least not without so much volume on the clean that it gets distorted).  My hope was to adjust the volumes of the inputs to the two channels using the handy volume knobs on this pedal. But No.  When you use it in A/B mode, it bypasses the volume.  Why? Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? (I have no idea, but it's stupid... the knobs are RIGHT there). This was a quick return for me. Depending on your applicaiton, your results may vary.	-1
I read the comments about the smell, but I figured it was probably no big deal so I went ahead and bought them. Well, these things positively reek. It's not the smell of a rubber doormat or whatever - it's a powerful stench from another planet that will completely envelope your drum kit. I felt like I needed to wear a HAZMAT suit to play drums. They left a permanent stench on the head of my snare and I guess I'll have to replace it.  As for the sound reduction, these work pretty well - but if you have a sensitive nose (or maybe you're concerned about whatever kind of fumes are off-gassing from these things) I would just try to play quieter.	-1
Not sure how long the felt side should last, but mine is worn out after a couple months. Turned it around to the other side, more bass, not sure if I like it.	-1
Not a great option if you are looking to store more then two cymbals. Flimsy handles. Zippers are good but not enough interior coushing comparing other brand we have purchased after returning this one	-1
Nice enough case.  Fit a 4/4 violin fine.  No room for shoulder rest except in outside compartment.  BUT the case has a sickening smell and stuck up my whole house.  Left it outside to air out but no avail.  Did not want to think about the odor whatever it was transferring to my violin.  Sent it back.	-1
Both of the bottom pieces broke within the first few times I played on them, definitely very weak plastic. Disheartening to see my expensive cymbal sitting at the bottom of the metal cymbal arm because these broke.  Should have stayed with Tama, but wanted to give these a try. Never again!	-1
The tenor recorder was returned because it is too big for my small hands.	-1
I prefer a more traditional tenor with out keys as the  the double holes give more control of tone especially for F and C sharp. Double holes give more options for  high range tone control also.	-1
I bought this thinking it was a good deal for a starter.  I have since given it a second thought. The sound is good but the quality control is very bad.  It has poor adjusters and cracks in the wood which it should never have left the factory.  String change in necessary unless you like very sore fingers.  The frets look like someone put them in with a hammer, because all of them are different heights which makes it hard to play. Unless Ibanez improves on their quality control I would never purchase another. Then again maybe I just got a bad one but check the neck for straightness and all the other parts before purchasing.	-1
Maybe I just got a bad one, but this bridge is poorly finished. There are extreme stamping striations at the rear of the bridge where the adjuster screws pass through. These striations are really severe. Also, the bottom side of the bridge is a mess. I know that you'll never see it once mounted, but it just adds to the fact that this (these) bridge(s) are poorly made with little or no attention to quality control. This bridge is unacceptable, especially for an item that is "Made in USA"....or so they claim. The workmanship is so poor that I'm beginning to wonder if this may be a fake. Whatever the case, this bridge isn't going on my '54 build. Unfortunately, this bridge sat unopened on a shelf in my shop for a couple of months during which time the return window for Amazon had closed. That's my fault. I should have inspected the part immediately so I wouldn't be stuck with it. The bottom line here is that it's up to you. You can take your chances and buy this bridge from Amazon, but I would inspect it immediately. A better route would be to buy it locally and check it for quality before handing over your dinero. BTW-I snapped some photos hoping that I could include them in this review only to find that video is the only option.	-1
Purchased this from Music123, seemed like a quality bridge when received however two months later when I went to install it I found that the pickup mount was actually stamped out backwards. Now Music123 won't take it back. Burned for $40 bucks on Amazon.	-1
I am a tone freak. I bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff. At the time i had never owned a big muff. I thought the sound it produced was big muff sound. I later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff. The difference was huge. The big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box. I later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging. I am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal. I would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space	-1
My guitar tech would not install these because there was a small, copper wire the size of a hair sticking out of the back and going nowhere -- which was not in the wiring diagram.  It was a manufacturing defect, I guess.  He was not comfortable installing them in that state.  They were supposed to be new, but the box did look like it had been opened, before.  I did not figure this out in time to return the product within the roughly 30-day return policy, so I am stuck with a loss of $180.  Sitting on my desk, they are definitely noiseless!  Instead, I bought a set of the Texas Special pickups and absolutely love them.  Not sure how well these noiseless ones work when manufactured as designed and sold new, because one of those did not happen for me.	-1
Okay.. I live in the Philippines.  Shipping Weight cost is a consideration factor for us here.  I was about to order the ION USB Turntable until I came across this needle replacement ad.  How in blazes could it be justified that a 0.6 ounce item weight result in total shipping weight of 4 pounds?  I don't suppose these 2 needles got shipped in Lead cases, do they?  So I ended up not ordering that ION Turntable from Amazon.	-1
Stopped working after 1 month 15 days. Can't return it due to policy. LOST MY MONEY.	-1
It's supposed to sound like one, and while it does offer attack transients, it's no where near as subtle as the real deal, or any emulation by roland or boss (they're much better). This is fun to play around with, but it's not exactly what I'd describe as musical, and totally miss-tracks chords. If you play a single string and very hard it works alright, but those looking for a bargain basement slow gear may want to just spend a few more bucks and get a better pedal. I've found it more useful for mono synths than a guitar. Maybe mine's a dud, but who knows it's just collecting dust.	-1
It was Not what I wanted. When A Person has a low Income We can Not afford what We can Not use. I was looking for what Is called Shimmer most Reverbs do Not have Shimmer as the RV600 Because Digitech called Shimmer, String Swell and Volume Swell Is linked to the Violin Sound It cost Me 30.00 Its called Slow Motion for a reason because It has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear It Is with Over Drive being played on the high Strings. It might be good for playing with a Bow, I have No Idea because I can Not afford a Bow.	-1
I am not happy with this at all!! Here is why  1- The product is almost like a toy fell product and they don't give you much instructions on how to place a 9volt battery. 2- it doesn't sound very good at all I can see why it was 25$!!  The only good thing about this was how fast it was shipped to me!! I will be sending this back and using that money towards a Boss Pedal!!!	-1
I don't hate Behringer stuff, I actually like more their products than I dislike, but the pedal misses the mark. Just makes everything sound farty. I prefer the Joyo Voodoo Octave, which admittedly is pretty different compared to the SF300 as far as fuzz pedals go, but as cheap fuzzes go, the Joyo is still in my pedal chain.	-1
If you like EXTREME fuzz, then this is your pedal.  But if you want to tone it down a bit, the control knobs do very little.  I use the boost function much more than the actual fuzz.	-1
piece of crap. sounds good but broke pretty easy. doesn't work anymore at all, used it once or twice.	-1
I am a big fan of Behringer pedals. I have 4 or 6 of them. So I decided to try this one as I wanted a fuzz.  Honestly the UM300 does a better job and is more versatile.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this and buy the UM300.	-1
It's terrible.	-1
Everything I purchase from Amazon is garbage.  This pedal arrived today. After watching hours of online reviews. I was very excited to get this pedal. As soon as I received it I plugged it up. And of course it has problems. I am so sick of Amazon I don't even feel like talking about it anymore. It's only upsetting me more and more.  I am done with this crappy merchandise website!	-1
The casing is plastic. I have had to re-wire this twice. The cost was low which I guess explains the quality of the product. However, my disappointment comes more from the fact that most other Behringer items are of very high quality.	-1
The only reason I'm giving this two stars is it's under $25.  At moderate settings the fuzz is okay.  However, when you crank the gain there's so much fuzz you can't even hear the note you're playing.  The controls are packed so close together they are hard to turn.  It's made of plastic and can only handle light use.  This is one of those cases where you get what you pay for.	-1
The wah sound is good but the buffered bypass in this thing isn't very good. It will affect the sound of your overall signal chain if whether it's on or off. I personally didn't like the way it did that, but maybe you might get different results. Maybe if you've got a super bright sound and you're trying to tame that high end, I could see how this could remedy that. But personally, I don't like how it affects the sound when it is bypassed.	-1
I bought this for old school Wah (Hendrix/Clapton) .I tested it on a Tele and Strat. I did not test it with my SG. When I was young I bought the original Thomas Organ version Clyde. I also now have a Dunlop Crybaby GCB-95 too from many years ago. The Vox Wah sound  is very good, making a very good Wah Wah sound. Its range seems less. Also compared to the Dunlop it sounds weak, thin, and harsh but more vocal. I AB'd it and I just can't use this Wah because it sounds so thin as if some one chopped all the roundness off. It is a little more accurate than the fat sounding GCB-95. The Dunlop sounds round and big and is consider the standard these days. So I like the Vox Wah sound but it is not enough to override the thinness of it. I returned it.  If two people played side by side, GCB-95 and the VOX, people would think something is wrong with the Vox. Now if you are using humbuckers, the results may be different..  However for modern music, many other model Dunlops would be more appropriate as modern day Wah is not the same as old school Wah.  I do know that this Wah is VERY popular so read other people's reviews and watch/listen to online videos. Many people however buy it for its looks because they saw Hendrix use one and worse still, they might take off one foot because they notice Hendrix sometimes had only three rubber feet on it, probably only because he lost one. I bought this because I actually had one of the original  VOX Wahs, unfortunately, at least from what I remember, it is not close enough. I really wish I liked it.  And BTW, Dunlop makes both their and Vox's Wah Wahs so it is a design decision on how they sound. In fact most of it is the same.  When considering a Wah, you might want to get one with an adjustable output and other adjustments. When you look at signature models remember you do not have all the other equipment the artist has.  The low cost Dunlop, is a very good choice for most. You may decide even if you want a Wah at all. Using a Wah is not just rocking your foot, you have to have feel - if you don't you sound like an idiot and a poser. That is one reason so many used ones are available.  My final decision on a Wah was to go a more expensive route because I wanted to get it over with and get the perfect Wah for me once and for all. I wanted what I had when I was young as  that sound is in my head.  I chose to get a complete drop-in replacement with buffer from Area51 because I already had a Wah to put it in. Otherwise I would have just bought a complete Area51 Wah from him. He makes his own inductors the very important part of the tone. For most, and I want to be honest, a basic Dunlop Crybaby is fine and low cost and Amazon's price is as good as anyone else  plus you have Amazon backing up their sale. For those who spend a lot of time seeking the "tone" the difference is very noticeable and worth the added expense if you can afford  an Area 51.  The standard Area 51 Wah is perfect as it is, if you want the Thomas Organ Clyde old-school sound. Once you hear an Area 51 Wah, it is an education.  This is what a Wah is as far as I am concerned. It is also super well made.  In closing, I want to advise you again  to read other reviews because some people love these Vox Wahs.	-1
I just got this and I've noticed that it when I activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone... I have a crybaby that doesn't have the range the 847 does but its 10x's more transparent.  There may be other factors at play here as it is new, but the lesson is: try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you.	-1
Ive been a fan of Vox wah pedals for years and was really disappointed with this unit. It was meant to be a temp replacement for my JS big bad wah while it was in for repair after years of abuse and this thing sounds horrible. The pedal was chunky and i could feel the gears grinding when i would sweep. This thing just sounds like nails on a chalk board and digitalized. Maybe this would be for a beginner that didn't know better but for a seasoned player this is the worst. Spend the few extra and get something farther up the product line.	-1
This wah says made in China on the rear panel...I would pay more for one made in the good old USA...I did not know this until I received it and looked on the back panel...I am returning it for a full refund!	-1
I don't know for what size of strap these were designed for but they don't fit well mine. In my opinion the padded strap is a bit stiff when you place on your strap across your shoulders and adjustments to your strap is somewhat different to be done once it placed there	-1
Not very good design for it was meant to do. Does not relieve stress from the weight of the instrument. Not comfortable at all.	-1
This things slides around too much for me.  It is almost useless to me because of this.	-1
I really wanted to like this product, but I really wanted it to work as well.  I wanted comfort without having to replace all of my straps.  This concept is great, but the pad digs deeper into my shoulder than any of my straps ever did.  It's heavier than one would imagine, which adds to the reason I purchased it in the first place: to make my heavier basses easier to play for hours at a time.  It's stiff and does not stay in place.  Don't get me wrong: I love Planet Waves and will continue using their cables, but this product gets a thumbs down from me.  I decided to buy a more expensive, wider strap instead of finding a way to make this pad work.	-1
Not exactly as I hoped for. It's real stiff so I've placed it on a leather strap and keep it around strictly for emergencies.	-1
has a rough edge which cuts my neck.	-1
This product does very little to reduce the weight of the guitar, and the multiple pockets of gel are rather annoying on my shoulder. Additionally, the pad slides around so much, it's effectively useless.	-1
This really did not help. It is very hard and not very flexible.	-1
Ended up returning this item as it is so wide that it rubbed on my neck causing more discomfort than the original strap.	-1
The gel pad is a great idea the only flaw is that the edges of the pad dig into your shoulder. First time I used my pad for over an hour I had two red marks on my shoulder from the pad edges digging in. Good concept,bad design.	-1
I wanted a pad that would stop the strap from cutting into my neck. This pad, although comfortable, is too wide and not padded along the edges.	-1
To heavy....it doesn't stay where you need it. slips down becuase of wieght.. get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar...	-1
My hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder.  The gel is pretty dense, so it's kind of hard and squishy and very heavy!  I found that it just added more weight.  I'm not using it.  I would look elswhere for a different product.	-1
Note that this is for the jerk that is tryint to sell this pedal for over $200 dlls when it's worth less then half of what he has listed it for.... The pedal itself is a 5 star peda, no doubt about it... A must have overdrive... But please look at other listings that sell ot for the actual retail price... About 120 dlls...	-1
Buy it for looks, as a decoration, not as an actual percussion instrument! The very first time I used it the wand broke. Not a big deal, I'll use something else, but this thing just doesn't make much sound anyway. Now I understand why they don't sell them at Guitar Center....	-1
The price on this pedal was very low, and now I know why.....not only does it give an unsatisfactory wah sound, it turns your guitar tone into something nasty and nasaly. If you want a wah effect, get a Morley, or if you don't want to use your foot, get a good quality envelope filter. Leave this one in the box.	-1
The nylon tips fell off after just a few hours of playing..  a few didn't even last that long..	-1
plastic pops off easily and ruins drum heads if you don't notice them instantly	-1
I never received them! twice I returned them for nylon tips and twice I received wood tips. After paying for shipping twice I decided to use them only for practice not gigs,both boxes they came in said they were nylon tips but they were wood tips. I'll never order drum sticks again	-1
Great for a bucket full of cheap sticks (about half of them were either thicker than 5a or warped) especially good for the price. If you want some pro sticks tho, buy some real sticks	-1
No..not a good product.  My son plays drums and goes through lots of sticks.  This looked like a good deal, but all they did was break.  I would not recommend and will not be buying these again.	-1
C'mon Bose, you're better than this. I mean, use it. But use it with much caution. I used it for about a year and my unit dropped to the floor maybe 20% of the time. After 4 solid hard drops, I had to retire the thing. It's not like it doesn't do the job - it does. But just very half-assedly. Also, if you're gonna use it, make sure to never clamp the latch 100% of the way shut. Instead, rearrange the rubber inserts inside and clamp the latch 50% shut. If you clamp it 100% shut, the latch will pry itself right off with the slightest pressure and render the unit inoperable. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I did get a solid year of use out of it. But the thing ain't built great.	-1
This broke the first time I went to use it on stage. It worked fine when I tried it a t home but the catch broke when I tried to put it on my mic stand the first time I went to connect it to the stand on stage.	-1
Just like the previous reviewer it broke when I was trying to put it on the Mic Stand. This design is a disgrace to Bose. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!  I love my Compact and the T1 is good. But the T1 clamp is made like a 99cent cheap toy.  I never even got to the step where I actually put the T1 on the clamp.  Epic Fail!!!	-1
tried this thing out I have got a couple of Behringer pedals and there OK and are decent for the price but this thing did nothing for me ....I guess at least with this one you get what you pay for! SO spend alittle more and get a decent comp pedal for your self	-1
I have to say, I generally like Behringer gear, but this pedal was an exception.  It's nice looking and simple to operate, but that's about all the positives I can come up with.  First and foremost, like the other reviewer said, when this pedal is on it severely sucks the bottom end out of your sound.  I hooked up my Jazz Bass and suddenly all the low-end warmth was gone.  Poof.  I didn't try it with guitar, but I'd imagine that with a Strat in the bridge pickup it would be screechingly trebly and painful.  Also, the LED is super bright (too bright), and for some reason Behringer wants you to use only their AC adapter, not the industry standard that Boss, MXR, and everyone else uses.  They even put a sticker over the jack!  The on/off switch looks like it clicks, but it doesn't.  I guess that's a plus because it's a noiseless switch, but to tell the truth I thought it was broken at first.  But I guess the final straw for me was that it really didn't do that great of a job of compression, either.  (At least for bass.)  This is a gentle, rounding compressor, and if you are looking for serious squish, look elsewhere.  Honestly, the tone change when activated is just this side of unacceptable, at least to my ears.  If you are a guitarist, very short on cash, and like your tone super trebly, then this might work for you, though. I'd recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BBE-Opto-Stomp-Optical-Compressor-Guitar-and-Bass-Pedal/dp/B000K67YC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BBE Opto Stomp Optical Compressor Guitar and Bass Pedal</a>&nbsp;instead.	-1
thing died two days after I bought it, but then again considering what I paid for it I got my money's worth - I guess	-1
I was willing to give it a try but It knocks all the low frequencies out of my guitar signal this is a terrible and unforgivable oversight. Now I need to spend more money to get one that works. Sorry, Behringer some of your stuff is great but not this one	-1
I don't understand how this flimsy garbage gets such good reviews. It most certainly DOES feel like it's going to crack or break, if you lean to either side even slightly. I'm not even slightly overweight  I find myself using the height memory clamp to help stablize the seat at least a little, but then the stools height slowly lowers as I play... marring up/scratching the hell out of the post, just like it says in the video it won't do.  lol  Oh no it's not.. it's just grinding nylon bushing into it. X-)  So I have a choice between really wobbly/nearly breaking seat and stable height,  or sort of more stable seat and kinda unstable height.  I guess under $100 is still not enough to get anything that isn't crap.  -Julie	-1
Not that heavy duty for a 200 lb man.	-1
Needed an extra throne, I'm spoiled I guess. It's not my rok n sok. Works in a pinch but wouldn't want to use it for a gig. Little shaky and don't sit long	-1
I owned this practice set for almost one month.  I returned it.  It works great IF you like to stop playing because you constantly need to retighten the arms holding the practice pads.  Because thats all you are able to (consistently) do - not practice, just retighten the arms over and over and over.  Good for people who like to constantly tighten things, because if so, for that it works great.  EVERY TIME I played this set, it would come loose and one or more of the practice pads would "flop" upside down.  I would then have to stop playing to reset the pad back upright and then re-tighten the arm holding it.  I could not play this set for more then 30 seconds without this happening over and over.  Each time I tried tightening harder and that did not work either.  Why should you have to over tighten in the first place?  I gave up on it and returned it after about 30 days.  This set never stayed solid, it was always coming loose (referring to the arms that extend outward and hold the actual practice pads).  I do not know how ANYONE can give this set a good rating.  I hope this review helps because if you want to practice, you won't be able to using this set.  If DW fixed this design flaw, and the pads would stay in place (NO I DONT WAIL ON MY DRUMS EITHER) then I would buy it again.  But like I said it is unplayable being that you have to constantly stop playing because the pads have "flopped" upside down.  Great idea, Bad design!  hope this helps!  good luck!  ...update comment 12-21-14 If this practice pad set worked as it was intended (see my review above) Id give it 5 stars + "KUDOS"  Id love to own something pretty much exactly like this if it did indeed "work" (again see above review), but this one doesnt.  Zero stars bec it skcus ssa	-1
This seat wasn't comfortable at all.  It literally hurt my back.  The metal stand shed some greasy silver gunk.  I haven't returned anything in the years of buying tons of items from amazon unless they were broken.  This was the first simply because of how cruddy the product was.	-1
its ok	-1
I'm rough on stuff,mine broke. My fault.	-1
Drum stick destroy cymbals with white paint everytime I touch a cymbal it leaves white marks and on a 300 cymbal I cannot clean it off unless I buff it out .. bigger style sticks	-1
I routinely put a 12AY7 in the first slot of any amp where I want to get a little more headroom before the amp clips. This one was for a Deluxe Reverb. Together with a pair of JJ 6V6S power tubes, a DR won't go mushy or aggressive as early on the volume dial.  I had some kind of NOS JAN 12AY7 prior to this one, that came in the amp when I received it. That tube quickly developed a hum. I'd heard reports of it not being uncommon. Having luck with the EHX/Sovtek 12AX7LPS and its lower gain rebranded 5751, I was hoping the 12AY7 would prove to perform equally as well.  I should probably add that the last two EHX/Sovtek 5751's that I've bought in the last few years also developed noise. None of the ones from years ago did this. So when this 12AY7 developed the exact same hum, it was not entirely suprising.  I don't know if it's an issue with the manufacturing, but I've heard that could likely be the case. However, this is the third EHX/Sovtek tube I've had make noise in my Deluxe Reverb. I thought it may be an issue with the amp itself, but 12AX7's and 12AT7's don't have the same problems, including the EHX 12AX7. I put a EHX 12AT7 in the phase inverter slot of this amp at the same time, and it's fine.  So it seems that even if you pay multiple times more for a NOS or UOS 12AY7 that it would be worth it. If I'd have gotten a year and a half's use from this tube, I'd say it's worth it. But the hum makes it a deal breaker.	-1
After watching many YOU TUBE videos demonstrating this item, I figured I could use it to create my own backing rhythms for my guitar playing. Well...that was a mistake. I could not discern any change in the loudness of sounds no matter how hard of soft I hit the pads. Also, the kick-drum pedal kept skipping. It was returned the next day.	-1
Having purchased several great Yamaha products in times past, I was optimistic that this drum set would follow suit.  But It simply did not work for me for a number of reasons. First, when you strike the drum pad on some of the selections, you must hit it really hard to be able to hear anything. This was also the case upon connecting it to my high-end Behringer amplifier.  Secondly, the drum pads are laid out and spaced a bit clumsily, with eight of them being a bit overboard. (Consequently, I found myself hitting the metal frame more often than I'd like to.)  Third, some reviewers complained of the foot pedals, and they are right--they are crap.  Ditto with the headphones, as I used my Sennheiser for better quality of sound. I am also confused as to why the price of the ailing kit is the same as the drum machine itself.  There are positives however: it has a very nice sound, ports for use with a snare drum stand, and a very diverse song database for learning the art of percussion. You may also appreciate the light weight, and portability.  As an alternative before you buy, take a look at the PYLE PTED06.  It has comparable features (except for the snare stand ports), much better reviews, and will save you $60 or so. Also, each drum pad features a little light that flashes every time you hit it, which is a great visual tool for beginners like me. Within the first 5 minutes of sampling it, I could tell it was more logical as a path to help me learn percussion.  The foot pedals sound much better, are also louder, and are more stable.  But whatever you decide, I say experiment with it and trust your first instinct. More money doesn't mean better quality.	-1
I was disappointed with this product. One of the floor drums did not work at all.	-1
I returned tis device.  It's a toy.  Not for anyone wanting to learn the drums.  Much to small.  Maybe good for a child, but not an adult.	-1
I bought it for someone else.  They have brought it to me twice to fix.  Probably not Nady's fault there, but in the process, the cheapness of the unit is apparent.  The input jacks are flimsy and break easily.  I don't know how well it works when it's not broken.	-1
Didn't work so I returned it.	-1
There's always someone, who got to have received a bad unit, and in this case, it is me. The unit itself seemed ok, sturdy made, good enough for what it is. I initially bought it for an amplifier at home I have, to add some reverb to the voice, but the unit only produced a loud buzz on one channel! I even tried with headphones, and the same thing, just a buzz, no audio. I thank Amazon for the easy return prolicy!	-1
You get what you pay for.	-1
Typical brass cymbal: Clangy overtones, short sustain, insensitive, not much volume. But there is a bright splashiness that cuts through, as long as you hit it really hard. And with enough ambient music, you don't notice the nasty overtones. Not a great deal at $40.	-1
This cymbal is a very thin cymbal, the first time it got played it ended up with a dent on the edge.  For the money it is a good cymbal, but definately for a starter kit.	-1
not good. poor quality, broke almost immediately, very low quality. you get what you pay for	-1
it failed after 30 days of use, had to throw it away since the amazon 30 days return period ended	-1
Wrong size prong	-1
Supposedly tested and approved for resale through Amazon Warehouse Deals. Connector was broken and un-repairable upon receipt. Returned for full credit...That's the only good news on this one.	-1
got theses but the one of the cables were defective.  I need a new one and don't think i should pay for shipping either to return it or have another one sent. I have enclosed 2 pictures.  Today is the first time we had put our system together and the end come right off!  Please contact me regarding this!  Thank you Kerry Powell	-1
ordered these and one doesn't work out of the package	-1
Don`t use them anymore	-1
Great cables but I did not need XLR cables , I needed 1/4 to 1/4 in 50 ft length , I already bought a 30 ft 1/4 to 1/4 . Your stupid website recommended these cables with the speakers I bought and the connection was not speakon,xlr but was 1/4 mal . Now I am stuck with this garbage .	-1
1 Cable of 2 was defective.	-1
This is absolutely not 12 gauge wire...  I bought this cable along with some neutrik connectors to make a 5' speakon cable for a bass guitar amplifier. I figured that if the reviews were right and the connectors were terrible then I will just buy this cable and some nice Neutrik connectors, discard the included ones, and have 25' of 2 conductor wire left over in case I need to make other cables, Speakon or otherwise. Not a bad deal for about $30... Well, I was wrong. This cable is not 12 gauge wire; it's more like 16 gauge, possibly 14. I can't use this for what I wanted to. I will keep it and use it as backup cable for a home theater sound system, but I could've just bought normal speaker wire for that.  As for the connectors, the Speakon connector is not bad. It's much longer than a Neutrik and certainly not as solid, but I wouldn't be worried about using it if I had to. Also the Speakon end was connected very well internally. The 1/4" connector however, was not. The connector itself is very nice looking and feels very sturdy but the soldering job inside was terrible. The wire wasn't tinned before the connection was made and the joint was a cold solder joint plain and simple. I have no doubt this cable would've failed eventually with normal use.	-1
Junk...Internal components are cheaaaappppppppo	-1
Not what they say ,but makes a good back up, but don't use it on hi wattage speaker systems about  200 to 300 wats will all it will be good for and I'm pushing the 300	-1
una  cagada	-1
First, the strap is a little shorter than it should be, so if you're a taller person (I'm 6'), it may not be long enough for you. The real deal-breaker though was the bottom leather piece that attaches to the bass guitar completely came off! The stitching must've broke. I'm so lucky I didn't drop my bass when it happened. I had only used this strap once for a few hours.  The primary job of any bass strap is to keep your bass secured, and this strap failed utterly at that task.  I found a much better strap here on Amazon. Better quality, more comfortable, and it's also longer. It's also around $5 cheaper, so win win win! You can find it here:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Neotech-8301052-Mega-Bass-Strap-Black/dp/B000P4FBQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Neotech 8301052 Mega Bass Strap, Black</a>	-1
Not quite worth the cost. Yes it is fairly comfortable but it still slides quite a bit and the sizing is extremely limited. Also, the holes in the leather are pretty small. I had to cut mine with scissors just to get it to fit onto my guitar.	-1
This strap is too narrow for me. It is about 2 inches wide. It hits me in the wrong place and hurt my shoulder immediately. I tried to put it on a Gibson SG. The strap lock system is too hard to get on and off. The Gibson cases fit the guitar too tight to leave a strap on in the case. Taking that folded over strap lock off and on is ridiculous. Why not just use a normal strap lock system? I got this as a gift. I hope I can take it back. Otherwise it will go in the closet with all the other unused stuff I have gotten over the years.	-1
I was going to try another way to hook up my speakers. But this cord is not it. First the side you plug in don't stay plugged into the amplifier. plus it sounds horrible nope I'll just stick to regular speaker wire	-1
I bought 2 Pyle speaker cables a few years ago and one of them didn't work right out of the packaging.  The other one wasn't grounded properly and had a hum to it that never cleared up.  Fast forward a few years later and I buy 4 of these for a friend on a budget - I told him my experience, but he insisted.  Guess what?  2 of the 4 didn't work right out of the bag and 1 of them had a hum and the other one worked fine.  So if you want 1 out of 6 cables to work for you, then be sure and buy Pyle of JUNK cables!	-1
Despite Pyle-Pro's less than sterling reputation, I was encouraged by some of the reviews I read here. I ordered two of them. Neither of them worked.	-1
Bought two of these for band sound system. Have had to rebuild the speakon connectors on both of the cables due to corrosion where the wire is soldered and slides into the speakon sleeve. The wire had completely turned to powder. They were not abused or left in a damp location. Haven't had any problem with the 1/4 end of the cable.	-1
I own over ten of these and would love to love them, but cannot. Here are the problems I have had:  - Speakon connectors do not properly mate with my power amp (when I am using a PA based on an unpowered mixer), or my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Peavey-XR8300-8-Channel-600-watt-Powered-Mixer/dp/B001Q5S99M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Peavey XR8300 8 Channel 600 watt Powered Mixer</a>&nbsp;connectors. In one case I had to use pliers to remove the connector (and I do know how to properly insert and remove Speakon connectors.) I believe Pyle may have cut a few corners when sourcing the Speakon connectors.  - Very high failure rate. In my case half of my cables failed. Most problems were due to bad soldering on the connectors, which is an easy enough fix, but unsatisfactory from a quality perspective in my opinion.  If you are handy with a soldering iron and want to invest in a quality Speakon connector like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Neutrik-Speakon-Connector-4-Pole-Inline-Plug-NL4FC/dp/B005EKMGO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Neutrik Speakon Connector: 4-Pole Inline Plug NL4FC</a>&nbsp;this cable may be a good deal. Personally I am replacing all of mine with a quality, name brand cable, which I should have purchased in the first place.	-1
I ordered this cable as well as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pyle-Pro-PPSJ50-50ft-12-Gauge-Professional-Speaker-Cable-Compatible-With-Speakon-Connector-to-1-4/dp/B002UL5W4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pyle-Pro PPSJ50 50ft. 12 Gauge Professional Speaker Cable Compatible With Speakon Connector to 1/4''</a>&nbsp;model only to discover the following flaws:  (1) The Speakon connectors are low quality in my opinion. My biggest complaint is how poorly they mate with the connectors on my powered mixer. I also tried them on my power amp, which is the heart of my studio sound system with the same results - no smooth fit and disengaging from the mated connectors is even worse. I had to use pliers in one instance!  (2) Cables are fragile. I've experienced over a fifty percent failure rate with over ten cables. Not a good indicator of quality in my opinion.  It is possible to cure flaw (2) by re-soldering the connection points,. Fortunately, the connectors are designed for quick removal and to provide access to the wires. However, that means that you still need to purchase decent quality Speakon connectors to rectify flaw (1). Considering the additional costs it is probably cheaper to purchase a higher quality brand in the first place.  Another point is I agree with others that the cable gauge does not appear to be 12 ga. That is not the barrier to me because it is still heavy duty. It's the failure rate and what I consider to be extremely low quality Speakon connectors that compel me to recommend against this cable.	-1
These cables are very poor quality - they are made with low quality copper wire that is brittle and suffer from frequent breaks at the point where they join the cable ends.  I have 2 sets of these (4 cables) all have failed after less that a dozen uses.  Failures occur at both ends of the cables at plug connections. Stay away from these cheap and poorly made cables - they will let you down!	-1
Bought a brand new Behringer PMP1680S powered mixer and wanted a couple of new quality cables to go along with. Treated these cables like they were made of glass. In other word, very carefully. Hooked em up and I wasn't getting any sound out of the mains. After fooling around for 45 minutes thinking it was something I was doing wrong we gave up and just used the one channel. When I got home, I unscrewed the speakon side only to find that the wires literally fell out of the casing. I assume they were originally attached but the slightest tug must have made them fall out. Yea! China strikes again. I screwed it down and now it appears to be ok. I e-mailed Pyle Pro and it's been a week ago and ya know what they said.........Nothing. THEY NEVER RESPONDED.	-1
I decided to replace my evah pirrazi string that i had on my instrument for about two years with Dominant. Unfortunately the A string started to peel on the outter shell two weeks after setting the dominant on my instrument. It was very disappointing and I couldn't beleive that it was only because of the sharp finger nut as I had my evah pirrazi for a quite while. In addition, I always graphitize the finger nut and the bridge before replacing a new instrument. Once I contacted the seller, he did not admit that it could be the defective product and did not agree to send me a replacment. In general, the quality of the string was acceptable but much less than evah pirrazi. I just ordered another evah pirrazi and took off the dominant one.	-1
The dominant A string broke at the loop end when I was tuning. It has been used only for few hours on my second violin, since I have bought it. Some of other reviewers had the same problem. I am not a beginner.	-1
I purchased this AC adapter to use with my Tascam DP-008EX portastudio home recorder specifically because the title, photo and description of the adapter led me to believe this was an OEM Tascam adapter - which is what I expected. What I received did not look anything like the adapter in their ad, plus it was not a Tascam product. It is made by a company called "UpBright". See the photos I've attached which show the adapter I received. However, this adapter does power my Tascam recorder and so far seems to work just fine. The jack does not insert all the way into the device, but it still seems secure. I'm not pleased that it was not at all what their ad depicts tough.  PROS: It works and powers my Tascam DP-008EX recorder CONS: It is not what I was led to believe I was buying. It is not a Tascam OEM adapter. It is significantly overpriced for a no name generic adapter (there are identical generic ones for much less money available). The jack does not insert completely into the device (about 3/16" gap between the device and the black plastic grip on the adapter jack where the metal part of the jack in put is exposed).  The seller should revise their ad to show an actual photo of what they are selling and provide the correct name of the manufacturer of the adapter (UpBright) so buyer will know exactly what they are buying and not confuse it with an OEM adapter.	-1
There's no excuse for this not being included already.	-1
If you want to use this to power up a Tascam DR series digital recorder, I have a less expensive solution for you:  if you own a usb wall charger (like a cell phone charger), you can use that to power your device through its usb port. That's a lot cheaper than spending twenty-something dollars on an additional wall wart!	-1
waste of money. fake reviews	-1
I really don't like to leave bad reviews, but I also really don't like having to replace equipment. Less than 9 months later, this has stopped working properly. Won't stay connected to my keyboard, and when I jiggle it around, it causes a loud pop in my monitors, obviously. I could probably find some way to reinforce the connection with duct tape or whatever, but I'd rather just have a cable that fits properly and stays firm and solid. I never even moved this. Very light use, in my studio only.	-1
Get 10 of these! You will need them because you can hook them up and use them about 3 times before they stop working. Cheap, cheap. You get what you pay for.	-1
faulty cable	-1
breaks easily	-1
Poor quality	-1
great cable! so far, no hums or hisses. Not the most heavy duty, but what do you expect for the money?!  EDIT: after only one use, and a few months of sitting around, it has developed a hum. Very disappointed!	-1
Junk	-1
I purchased this for home recording use as an add on item with a condenser Mic since the mic requires phantom power. I hooked it up to my Focusrite and was shocked to find NOTHING coming through. Junk, stay away.	-1
Makes a popping sound on multiple microphones.	-1
Stopped working after a week and a half.  JUNK.	-1
Do Not waste uour $5 here unless your goal is to buy tthe most toxic smelling cabble at the cheapest price.  I was so dissappointed i put mine strait in the waste basket for the trashman rather than bother to return it. Dont make the same error.	-1
These cables are jacketed with an awful compound that offgases heavily.  In other words, they smell really bad.  As soon as I took them out of the bag my friend across the room commented on the smell and we had to open the window.  They worked, but I had to put them back in the plastic bag and move them into another room.  After I put the cables away my hands smelled like the cables and I felt the urge to wash them immediately.  I am not a squeamish person.  I can recognize when a problem is minor enough to ignore.  This smell can't be ignored.  Don't buy these.	-1
low quality	-1
One of the 4 wires I bought went out the same night of use. The second wire, doesn't lock onto microphone vut still works. I haven't even open the other two wires I bought. Price is great for the poor product I received.	-1
Again?	-1
Great product, quick delivery!	-1
Hmmmm	-1
Here's the thing about XLR cables. If they work, they work and you never notice them. If they don't work, they create more of an issue than you can dream. I purchased 2 CBI cables and received them within the appropriate time line and they were well packed. However, as you will see in the photos below, one of the cables was absolutely a terrible cable to send out. The connectors were covered in some sort of sticky mess and the Phillips screw was completely stripped out on of the connectors. Terrible terrible experience for me. I will attempt to return this cable and receive another from the company.	-1
when I got mine it didn't work so..	-1
cable didn't work.  wasn't good quality work making it.	-1
ok usable	-1
Microphone cable is build very cheaply. The cord is thin and fragile.  You are better off going to Guitar Center and actually seeing what you are buying.	-1
That product I received was not as advertised.  It was a male to male not a female to male and cost me time and money to make it work.	-1
Be careful; I have a small recording studio, so we put our cables through a lot, and these guys just don't last. They were fine for the first few months, but then they started to die like a murder mystery. Seriously, one after another they would just go, for no apparent reason.  Fine one second, and then it would just go horribly staticky. I actually had two blow at one time, and thought my PA was shot. Thankfully, it was just these cables. NOT GOOD. Spend a little extra on another brand. These have been my favorite:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GLS-Audio-25ft-Cable-Cords/dp/B000RKL8R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GLS Audio 25ft Cable Cords</a>	-1
Cheap cables, cheap connectors that fall out of jacks. Don't bother. Try GLS instead. Tempting for the price, but unless you use in fixed install, these won't last long.	-1
I have finally learned my lesson.  I have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say "good for static applications" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors...But they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.  But now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to work. A week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.  So by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple "does it work yes/no" is clearly not good enough, as i learned	-1
Not for stage use. Broke after 2nd use, a total of 6 hours. Save your money and buy something else.	-1
it's true, this kind of cables need lot of care if you want to use them for a long time, after y fourth day of use, a friend put his shoes over cables and with a little pulled of the mic, cable has disajusted, and stop working. i've had to open the cable and use my knife to cut cables and make it work again	-1
the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables. don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES	-1
This guitar is a good buy for the money, but with the new wave budget Oscar Schmidts, you have to watch out. They come up horribly setup from the factory and if they don't go through a good dealer you're going to get problems that other reviewers have listed... bad setup, electronics don't work, etc. Unfortunately Oscar Schmidt was bought by the same company that also now owns the Washburn name (which also come terrible half the time nowadays... though they sell upper scale models they also sell budget Washburns at Target). You're welcome to read my "So you want to own an Oscar Schmidt Guitar?" review under product review guides. Amazon always deletes the link but it will come up under that name.	-1
I ordered this for my daughter as a back up. we finally opened it to get it ready and started tightening , the end part broke!	-1
My old bow was broken so I bought a couple of new bows. This one was super cheap and it definitely sounds like it. The only good thing I can say about it is that the sound it makes is really muffled compared to better bows so if I am practicing after 9 at night I will use this bow to stop the sound from piercing my whole house and annoying my family.	-1
It came with the hairs very loose and with no tension whatsoever. I didn't try to tighten it because most of the hair had already started to come out of it. I wanted to use this to play the musical saw, but there was no way that this bow would ever take that amount of strain. That being said, I never got to use it. Very cheaply constructed and not worth the money.	-1
You get what you pay for. Spend $20 or $25. The hair sucks on this thing. The curve is also uneven. It's brazilwood so it is light and flexes well but it has too many drawbacks to recommend. AVOID THIS BOW.	-1
The amp works good enough for a beginning guitarist but is has loud static and isn't really loud enough to play with more than one other person.	-1
My guitar Amplifier doesn't working... After 2 days work, it doesn't working any more, something went wrong system burned. I'm very disappointing!!!!!! I can't find the master who can make my amplifier, don't know what to say... very very disappointed!!!!!!!!!! I was waiting this purchase as something very important for me and now I'm killed.	-1
These are great for practice if you don't mind going through about a stick or two an hour, also, I had 3-4 sticks loose their plastic tips within about 10 minutes of playing with them. As they get even the slightest bit worn, they become flexible and very flimsy, making drums sound flat and feeling a bit like you're playing with jello sticks. I am a heavy player, but do not have this problem with any other brand of sticks I use. Most other sticks I use can be missing half their diameter from rim shots and still hold steady. Moreover, my other sticks will gradually start breaking and become unusable, giving me time to switch out to a fresh stick, whereas these seem to be fine on one hit and the next you're left holding a quarter of a stick because it literally just exploded. Not good, cannot recommend.	-1
WEAK, HORRIBLE STICKS......DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.. BROKE 90% OF THEM WITHIN TWO WEEKS	-1
STICK ARE NOT MATCHED.	-1
now lets see recived my first package of drum sticks with a empty box(large) and a invoice that says 12 pair drum sticks. NO, Sticks in the box but had packing material, I thought it was funny had a good laugh, contacted customer support they did a good job promtly sent out another order of drum sticks 2 days later box arrived large box opened it up and only 1 pair of drum sticks, but the invoice still says 12pair of drum sticks. OK, now I'm iratated!, I contacted customer support again they were very helpful I stessed to the lady that it is 12 pair of drum sticks 24 single sticks in all. here is the decription of the item  On Stage HN7A On Stage 7A Drum Sticks - 12 Pair, Nylon Tip  12 pair make 24 single sticks thats what I read, right? let's get this right amazon don't let me down you haven't ever don't start now.  PS: the sticks were good quality tips won't come off plays good!! for the one pair that I've recived...good stick if you can get them all in...lololol	-1
they don't ship to hawaii. i paid for this and they refunded my money because they don't know about ups, posat office, fred ex......... duhh....	-1
This is not a Yamaha stand. This is not a good all around universal type keyboard stand. Even when locked into position it wobbles with a keyboard on it. Very uncomfortable to play on. Pieces fall off easily. I can't think of anything really positive to say about this item. An overall huge disappointment.	-1
This is not for a yamaha and the bottom legs are unstable	-1
This came with the Yamaha keyboard so DUH! Why doesn't it fit??  There are indentations on keyboard and a place for a stand to attach but clearly NOT this stand.  Why would Yamaha include a stand that so obviously is not made for the keyboard??  And now I have to pay to ship it back but where?  to Amazon or to Yamaha?  What a waste!	-1
NO Truss rod, No Fret Markers,Nut and Bridge was junk, Finish was like it was done outside in a sandstorm,Only after replacing the nut,Bridge,strings,Filing the frets, Did it even sound like a guitar able for a student, If you think this is a good deal, Sorry to say it's NOT.	-1
was damaged when received	-1
Bent neck. Does not play.	-1
IT BROKE ON THE SHIPMENT:(	-1
I ordered this for my son for school. He's going into an acoustic guitar class. He didn't take care of his electric very well, so I didn't want to spend a lot on an acoustic guitar only to have him break it. I decided to go with this and wish I hadn't. It was packaged just as any other guitar would be. Box appeared in good shape, but when I pulled the guitar out of the box and the bag it was in, I noticed some damage on the fret board.  Needless to say, I'm not happy. It shouldn't affect playability, but I didn't buy scratch n' dent guitar, I purchased a new guitar. I know it's not expensive, but come on. Have a little pride in your work! The strings look and feel like they've been used. And not just used to string, but played on. If I got a previously used guitar that was marked new, I'm going to be upset.	-1
I was a bit disappointed when I received this guitar set.  The guitar itself has a very visible paint or glue drip.  Also, the description said it had an extra SET of stings, but there is only one included	-1
This guitar is definitely a starter one.  After practicing on it for four months, I've found that it does not give off a good sound.  The face of the guitar is peeling.  The guitar bag that came with it is cheap material and give no protection at all.  This was not a good buy.  I would not recommend this guitar for a beginner or anyone else.  Not worth the money.  What a waste because now I have to buy a better guitar!	-1
Sent it back, I understand that I am buying a cheap guitar but it was messed up when I bought it one of the cords couldn't be tuned because the thing wouldn't turn right and that was brand new out of the box. I felt bad because this was my daughters Christmas present and she couldn't even use it so I sent it back.	-1
Poor Quality of string	-1
Very disappointed. The guitar does not stay in tune at all.	-1
no good to setup	-1
I gave this guitar 1 star, I couldn't find half of star. Dislike it and the seller didn't live up to their work. No recommendation....I wouldn't waste the efforts to return it. Don't worth the trouble. You get the guitar right away you replace strings before playing just to adjust the strings. Nothing else came just a little tiny plastic bag with a pick and a tiny string. Total disappointment ....	-1
seemed cheaply made,  i sent it back.	-1
Get this product for a 10-yr-old learning guitar, but for no other reason. It plays sounds, but is not fun to play at all. It's a great price, but not a guitar you would want to play with for long.	-1
Fretboard is loose screws pulling out from body.  Not a bit happy, let's see how return goes.  Really not happy.	-1
I have never played guitar in my life so I was looking for something inexpensive to learn on, as a beginner. I gave it two stars because it IS a guitar, I like the black color and it comes with accessories. Delivery was also very fast.  Instructions were not included (I have no idea what a guitar tuner is or how to use it). As soon as I took the carrying bag out of the box, I noticed a problem with the zipper and the bag is really, really thin.  I inadvertently tapped the guitar on a wall as I was walking and it caused a crack in the thin wood...OMG.  And to top it all off, my daughter just popped a string.  This is a nightmare purchase for me and I wish I would have put my almost 40 bucks toward something of much better quality.  This guitar hasn't been in my house for an hour yet and already it's garbage.  UPDATE! I thought I'd give the guitar a chance and get the string replaced at a music store and they wouldn't touch it.  Simply because the bridge is not molded properly and if an attempt is made to replace the string, the bridge could pop off in someone's face.  They also told me that the guitar shouldn't have cracked when it bumped the wall. I ended up spending about $150 for something decent from the music store. The cheap products are not worth the headache and I plan on returning the guitar.  Beginner or not, I would not recommend this item to anyone.	-1
All that came with the guitar was Bag, Strap, Whisle.  Needs to be finish by hand or ship it back...  Stain as well inside the tuner pegs, with wood shaving.	-1
Never ever stayed in tune. cant even be classified as a beginners guitar. was of complete waste of money and time! DO NOT BUY!	-1
Unfortunately, it didn't fit my child. Didn't keep it for very long. The return was quick, and they had excellent communication and were easy to deal with. Great customer service.	-1
As everyone else has said ok starter, or dorm room guitar. Has some cosmetic flaws, needs real string ect... I bought 50 $19.95 guitars in 2009 all in original boxes, sized from 20" to 38". They were ALL junk, several had broken necks, one didn't even have the fretboard attached. But I lovingly repaired them and gave them all away except one I keep for myself and the one I put the fretboard back on, (it's still junk) basically bought this just to see what a $11.00 guitar would be like. It's actually $25.00 guitar as it cost more to ship it than it sold for. After I do my magic on it I plan on raffling it off to benefit the Arkansas Coalition of Disabled Musicians not for profit that I am the Director of.	-1
cannot be tuned correctly.  can only be tuned to itself, but not to other instruments.  not good to develop an ear by.  will mess up a beginner.	-1
it does not stay tuned at all, may take it to a music store to see if they can fix it.  Want kids to learn to play on it but afraid it won't stay tuned enough	-1
I ordered two of them.  One box was punched in some  but Not enough to damage the product.  Both have Big Gash on the top fret where they hung to Dry I assume.  Broken at the edges, and blotches of stuff all over the frets. Very poor Toy at the least.. Still waiting to see if they will take them back, photos sent to show proof to them. I want my money back for sure.	-1
the f fret is hard to hold and the rest of the things are alright there were no return slip	-1
When I received the guitar in the mail, I liked it a lot. However, I found it hared to tune, and use. In a couple of weeks the bridge broke. I was very disappointed. IO was reimbursed for the instrument, and I ordered a better more expensive one. I do not know if all of these guitars are like that, or if it was just a freak accident. I must say, it was beautiful to look at.	-1
I brought this guitar in Oct11 for reason that I was not sure how many days I will be in the US...so just thought of buying a cheap guitar to pass around time (I already have a full size semi-acoustic in my home country)...When i opened the pack I was surprised to see the quality and finish....I tuned it and started playing, the sound was not that bad...I was happy with it, but after some days the strings won't stay in tune even when tuned daily...that was a big Off...but i kept on tuning, but always it went off the tune...Also the action is too high and the fret board wood is rough....Then one day in Feb12 i found that the guitar had cracked at the finger board and main body joint....That was the end of a cheap guitar....Had the guiatr stayed in tune for many days, I would have recommended it to a fresher, for one to decide if he can pursue a guitar seriously...I am giving 2 stars in place of 1, just assuming that my piece was bad and some other guys migth be lucky to get a good piece....But, no guarantee about this product....Finally I bought $200 Ibanez elecrtic-acoustic pack on Father's day in Jun12...Thats a class guitar, a real quality at $200...	-1
I wanted a temporary guitar until I get back home and bring my original guitar, and this seemed to be good enough as a temporary solution.  But I was thoroughly disappointed by the low finish quality (messed up paint-job and scratches), and how rough the finger movement on the frets was. Moreover, the "Crescent" branding was absent, and after having tuned the strings I noticed the bridge had been raised a little, which raises the question how long it will hold. There aren't even any dots on the neck to assist you in finger placement, so the educational value of this is questionable.  I have since bought another guitar for $90, and the difference in quality is enough to encourage you to go ahead and start playing, instead of deterring you from it.  If you've ever held a decent guitar before, stay away from this as you won't even stand holding it. If it's just for a beginner learning guitar, I would still get something for around $80-90, since the sound and overall guitar quality has a big impact on a beginner's enthusiasm and desire to keep learning.	-1
I have never had such problems with guitar strings. I've been playing for about 15 years, and these are my least favorite I've ever bought. For starters, they don't stay in tune very well. I get some times strings need to be adjusted, but these are like every single day. Also, they don't hold up very well. I usually just strung along to country music, and I've flown thru these strings. They pop so easy with just a little bending, very disappointed.	-1
They are just rusty from the package	-1
I did not expect that the device runs on 120 -volt electricity Alas and non-transferable to a 220 -volt electricity	-1
I guess I know why the price is so low.  These are nasty strings with a poor feel and a cheap metallic twanging sound one would expect from a coffee can banjo than a quality bass instrument.  None of the rich thumping sound the instrument demands.  Highly disappointed at the poor quality of these strings, which are not worth even this price.  The second star is only because the strings sound slightly better through the amplifier (but jangle annoyingly to the player), and are priced well below competing brands, which are more expensive, but rarely better.	-1
The deadest strings I ever purchased. I thought they were defective so Dunlop sent me 2 free packs. Both packs were dead too. If you are use to high quality strings like DR, Rotosounds, or Blue Steels you will be disappointed with these.	-1
Well, I bought a EPI Les Paul 100 to start with.  New out of the box it had a discolord bridge. The Frets where not filed and sharp and the neck action was way to high.  However, it did sound really nice for the price.  Figuring these problems were due to the cheapness of the model, I decided to take the step up and buy the EPI LES PAUL STANDARD PLAIN TOP.  Surely any guitar with a great name like this and a price around 500 bucks should be perfect.  WRONG.  NEW AND OUT OF THE BOX...First of all I noticed that the Volume and Tone knobs were so far off the guitar body that they looked like 4 ufos trying to land.  I tryed to help them land by pushing down on them and realized that the whole assembly was bolted in on an angle, making the stems crooked.  So, when you turn the knobs they didn't even line up with the body one side would raise farther in the air than the other.  Ok, I really don't like to get shocks off from things when I use them either.  The pickups make exploding noises that are not feedback to make sure your awake even when you are not even strumming it. The D string is dead at the 3rd fret...And lastly so far when I plug my MONSTER guitar cord into the guitar, I do like to be able to unplug it again without a fight. The Guitar's finished looked like it had be resanded, there are specks of black dirt in the paint...and there is to much grain marks in the wood and not enough PAINT.  And of course theres a spot where the red paint has left a birthmark in the yellow part of the top.  THE ONLY GOOD POINT, IS GREAT NECK ACTION.  MY INSPECTOR FOR BOTH GUITARS WAS INSPECTOR NO. 1.  I hope this review is helpful to someone out there because I thought this was a quality product.  Your not buying the product obviously, you are buying just the name.  I did not purchase this from AMAZON for fear of Mail Damage.  But I should have because the damage is already done before the Guitar gets through the mail.  I have an IBANEZ ACCOUSTIC ELECTRIC and it is a quality product.  This thing will be going back I will be looking at IBANEZ ELECTRICS for a well finished product that will be more than worth the money.  Im done with wasting my time with EPIPHONE.	-1

Used it a couple times - just sits there under the table.  Can't get the right height, not very comfortable or sturdy.  I think I may shop for a stool or bench that is adjustabe and just have it adjusted to the right height.  Maybe that will work.  Unit works - just not the way I had hoped.	-1
Useless it doesn't work at all no signal	-1
Great item, but description is terribly wrong.  This is a LATCHING footswitch and not a momentary one.  If you check the Hosa website, the FSC-385 is a latching footswitch.  Unfortunately, all over the internet this is sold as a "momentary"....which is not true.  I tried to use this with my boss rc-3 looper and of course it will not function properly.  The price was great, so I most likely will end up soldering in some momentary switches myself and reuse the housing and 1/4" stereo jack.	-1
Real flimsy, not a road worthy piece. If this will sit on your studio desk and not get knocked around or bumped a lot, it's probably fine. Otherwise, it's a real piece of doot. The price reflects the low quality of the piece. I was however disappointed as Hosa usually produces quality gear. Not in this case. Also, I purchased this with the idea in mind that I would mod it to suit my Kemper. Well that didn't work at all. Still takes two clicks of each button to switch functions. Anyway, search for the "Johnson" foot switch in the same configuration. It is just a little more money and much better quality. This Hosa switch is a dooty.	-1
I have the same problem that another reviewer has. Sometimes I record and the sound is great, then for no reason, the sound is all noisy and garbled. When that happens, I have to restart FCP. I lose a lot of good takes and also lose time in a fast-paced production environment. This is not good. This is not acceptable.  I don't know if the problem is with the mic or with Apple...but I have the same problem on two different computers in both Final Cut Pro and Garage Band.  I cannot recommend this to other users of FCP or Garage Band.	-1
Couldn't get it to work.  By the time I figured it all out, it was too late to return.	-1
Noisy, not worth it at any price.	-1
No, don't. Too noisy. I swapped tubes and it didn't help. Not worth the space on your pedalboard.	-1
Probably going to send it back. Put in a jj. Playing through an ampeg v4.  This thing even dimed on master still sucks volume, meaning your clean channel is waaaay louder, so it's kind of unusable as a "channel switch " for dirty.  Tone seems ok, a little thin sounding but ok. Tha major problem is the volume discrepancies. I didn't notice anyone else saying this, maybe it's defective? I wanted to use it as a dirty preamp since the v4 (non master volume) basically stays clean even when it's ear drum busting loud. I'm sure I could mess with the eq on the pedal and dime that too to get closer to unity but really that's a bad problem, the pedal should not cut the volume so much when I kick it on. I don't want to have to fiddle with guitar knobs on the fly to get volume close.  Cheap pedal, worth a shot but not for me.	-1
I'm trying to like this pedal because everybody else does but I don't.  It is just blah.  It doesn't do anything well.  On its low distortion setting it is still too distorted with the stock tube.  On its high distortion setting it lacks richness and overtones associated with a more heavily driven tube amp and its too fuzzy.  I swapped out the tube for a JJ 12 AX7 and that is better.  The JJ is lower output so it does better on the low gain setting, adding just a little grain to the sound.  On the higher gain setting the distortion is smoother.  If I keep it I'll run this tube in it.  Then I tried an EH 12AY7 which is a lower gain tube.  Surprisingly it is louder and buzzier than the JJ and stock tube. When I adjust the gain to 1 - 2 the pedal seems to drop out or fade when the guitar decays.  It is obvious the circuit isn't designed for this tube.  I don't recommend it.  I've run it straight into a delay and reverb to a mixer, and I've run it into the front end of my new Bugera G5 and I feel the same about the pedal with both configurations.  The distortion on the G5 is much better than this pedal.  I realize this is only $50 so relative to its price point I can see why people think it performs well.	-1
I bought the used one on amazon and it has a buzz and control knobs don't work sometimes.	-1
