Easy	1
I don't know what to say about this to review. I'm trying to clear my reviews. Resolve carpet cleaner, I think everyone has used it sometime in their life...and it works well.	1
Just used this again yesterday on dog bile and vomit, which landed in multiple loads on my new light grey carpet. I'm telling you...Resolve pulled out all of the green bile, partially digested kibble, and heavens knows what else and that awful bile smell. Thank goodness that I had this on hand. Resolve has saved us more times than we would have liked!	1
works well	1
I don't care what anyone says, I think Resolve is the best carpet cleaner ever!	1
I have been using this for years to pick up spills specially related to pets. It REALLY DOES WORK! Highly recommend you try it out!	1
Good stain remover.	1
great for rem0v9ng carpet spots	1
As described.	1
good quick stain removal for dog accidents	1
Great for spot cleaning spills and tracked in dirt.	1
GREAT WILL PURCHASE AGAIN	1
This brand is pretty amazing but I really liked these disinfecting wipes. The smell can be kind of strong at first but I got used to it and I don't have the fear of wiping down anything for my cat and having to watch her to make sure she doesn't lick or smell the newly cleaned surface. She didn't feel either way about the smell which is great because I feared she was going to hate it but she doesn't feel the need to investigate the smell either like she would with normal chemical wipes.	1
These are good. I love that it's a cruelty free brand. These wipes do tend to foam up quite a bit. Sometimes you have to wipe after them with a cloth with just water.	1
as expected	1

Works great and quick.	1
This works better than most.	1
works good for cleaning up cat vomit on the carpet.  Leaves a residue so make sure you have a wet rag to try and wipe up as much as you can after you are done cleaning	1
I really like using these! So easy and effective and smell better than Ly..l	1
Works very well on carpet stains.	1
used this for years	1
TY	1
perfect	1
Seems todo the job.	1
This stuff works. Believe me, I know. I have 2 messy dogs.	1
Does the spot cleaning efficiently	1
Eliminated the musty smell after a flood from upstairs.  One application was all that was required.  Nothing to wipe, the mold was just dead.	1
Decent stain remover for carpets.  Only downside is that is highlights how faded the surrounding carpeting is (which is no fault of the product)	1
Useful	1
Picks up pet stains well, (hair balls) and smells great too!	1
Works great on stains	1
This worked awesome on my older red couch.  Seriously made it look like new.  I'm wondering why I didn't try this years sooner?	1
I have two toddlers. While I love the girls to pieces, they love brightly colored juices as much as I love the girls. They are also a bit flakey at times and will absentmindedly tip their cups while walking and spill the juice on my cream colored bedroom carpet. That is a recipe for disaster. I had shampooed the carpet numerous times and it didn't do much for the juice stains. Then I used this prior to shampooing the carpets and it made all the difference in the world. While it didn't totally eliminate the worst of the stains it did make a significant difference. I thought I'd have to replace the carpets this year. Now I think I can wait another year or two. Definitely works and definitely worth the money. A must for homes with messy toddlers.	1
Works well.	1
Love this stuff.	1
Like product	1
Removes carpet stains very easy.	1
Gets out the spots; great product.	1
Great, healthy choice for cleaning.  I'm not crazy about the scent, but it goes away fairly quickly.	1
We use these for cleaning items our babies touch. They are natural, work well, and smell delicious!	1
Nothing else I've tried comes close. I use this for quick and easy spot cleaning, it does the job it claims it will do.	1
its ok. the exact same thing you get at the store about same price too	1
Best thing for stains!!!	1
I bought this carpet cleaner in order to try to get up some of the random stains throughout our carpet, including pet stains and kid spills. It works fairly well, though the type of stain and age of stain really have an impact on how well this seems to work. The newer, dirt stains came up very easily with just a spray, short soak, and wipe. Some of the other stains were a little tougher, but either came out eventually or got a lot lighter. My only complaint is that it didn't work very well on the cat barf cleanup. This was fresh orange cat barf (you're welcome, don't ask me why my car barfs orange), and there is still a slight orange-tinted stain. I have been using Nature's Miracle on pet incidents, like this, which seems to work a bit better. All in all, though, this is a good stain remover for a good price. If you have regular stains, give it a try. If you have more difficult pet stains, I'd stick with a pet stain specific cleaner, though.	1
Cleans well, easy to use bottle!	1
I live in Arizon which has the hardest water I have ever seen. It has permanently ruined a lot of my crystal, which I like to use for entertaining, and being as hoity-toity as possible. The water did not leave spots on the crystal. Jet Dry would have taken care of that. It ate off the top layer of the crystal so what I have left are bowl and glasses with a rainbow sheen to them. Looks quite strange. The water is SO HARD that it ate through 8 inches of galvanized pipe on a well at my friend's house. That is just downright harder than hard. In fact, my friend laughed at me because I got a nice dishwasher with a stainless steele tub. The water ate her stainless tub right out of her dishwasher and she was forced to buy a cheapie plastic tub. It is YEECH water. I DO have a water softener. It works to some avail. Let's just hope the water doesn't eat up the softener. But anyway. You get the point. I have hard water which is lousy with mineral content that destroys whatever it can. I knew I was in trouble when the contractor gave me an extra year's warranty on my new house if I would put in a water softener. So now, the water finally plugged up the little jets on my old dishwasher to the point where the water would not spray out anymore into the tub. So I had to get a new dishwasher. I got a Bosch that was on an incredibly good sale and Bosch suggested that I use this Quantum Finish in the washer. I was surprised because I have heard only bad things about this type of dishwashing product. I have heard that it gums up your dishwasher motor and destroys it so that you have to get a new motor or another new dishwasher in about 5 years. I was not looking forward to that possibility, so I called the Bosch company which has done millions of washes with this Quantum product. According to them, the saving grace is the Jet Dry is built into the dishwasher tablet. It helps soften the water decreasing mineral sludge build up by its very presence. So, I asked. Well, didn't people always use Jet Dry in their dishwashers with the older products that were "all in one." I am referring to the all in one scrubbers without the Jet Dry. According to Bosch, the answer was NO. If people were trying to save money, they would buy the dishwashing product but not the Jet Dry. Or, they would just let the Jet Dry run out and not realize it until they got LOTS of spots on their dishes, and then they would refill the Jet Dry. (I have certainly let my Jet Dry dispenser run out before so I can surely empathize with all that.) So, much of the time, the Jet Dry, or similar product, was not used with the combination dishwasher tablets. And, without the Jet Dry, the plain old Cascade type product was safer than the combination product. Because the combination product, alone, will gum up a dishwasher motor. So, the safest, and most reliable thing to do is to buy this Quantum product with the Jet Dry in it. So how about the Quantum versus the plain Fishish product that has the Jet Dry in it. It is a little cheaper. Will it do the job? Well, it depends on where you are and how bad your water is. If you have reasonably soft water, the old, less expensive Finish will work. The Quantum product is made for really bad water areas and has a little more of each product in it: The Soaker, the Cleaner and the Jet Dry. So, overall, it is a slightly "better" product. So, that lets them get away with "Newer and Better" if they so desire. By the way, I always thought the Jet Dry was the little red dot, but it isn't. The red dot is the scrubber, with the blue being the cleaner and the white being the Jet Dry. I can tell just a little bit of differenence between the Quantum Finish and the older "Finish with Jet Dry" in my dishwasher. The Quantum does a slightly better job of getting all the crud and most of the spots off. I will admit, a few spots do remain. They are not on the glasses, but show up on pots and pans if the pots and pans have been severely dirty. I did buy a new product and have only gotten to use it one time. It is a Jet Dry Product that "drys" dishes. The Bosch dishwasher does not have a traditional heated drying cycle in it. Instead, it dries with the heat on water left on the dishes after they are washed and without ANY Jet Dry, it makes a haven for water spots. But with this additional drying product, which is just a slightly different version of the "getting off the spots" product, my spots are less. On a whole load, I had one spot remaining on a single pan that had been baked in and then left to sit in the dishwasher for 10 days. So, I am definitely a fan of this new Quantum Finish. How well it works for you is going to depend on some things: 1. How hard your water is. Mine appears to be the hardest I have heard of and it works well here. 2. Whether or now you use the Quantum or the older Finish. The Quantum is difinitely superior. 3. How new and super duper your dishwasher is. It must most assuredly work better in a new dishwasher. 4. If you have a Boshch...whether you consistently use the drying product. and 5. If you have hard water, whether or not you have a water softener. So, there it is folks. That is all the information I have. Hope it helps you decide whether this is safe for your washer or whether you want to stick with an old standby. I am going to give this a whirl! If it eats up my dishwasher, I will duly note that when it does so.  NOVEMBER 2011: I have a friend who sells appliances and one day we were discussing my use of the new Quantum Finish in my dishwasher. I told him how well I liked it. He said that his company had found that that the product was quite good AND that in many cases, the tablet would actually do two loads. His comment: "The manufacturer of Finish puts more product in that tablet than is necessary to wash a load...even if the load is full of dirty stuff. If you want to save a little money, you can cut those tablets in half." I kind of thought he was full of hot air, but I tried it and I tried it on a load that had a used cake pan that had not been cleaned and had been waiting to be washed for two weeks. Half a tablet and the whole load was clean. So, if you want to save a few pennies you might try that. Worked for me!	1
Great	1
If you get a spot on your carpet, (bad dog!!!) this will fix you up.  Spray it on, scrub it a little, let it dry, and vacuum.  Too easy.	1
This one works fine, but the Pet-specific version works better in my opinion. Then again, I am only using it to clean up mess from my cat's hairballs (ewww!).	1
Works great and is a good value on here. It can work on some upholstery as well as carpet.	1
It works well.	1
Amazing carpet cleaner. Haven't met a stain yet it can't remove	1
Between having 5 kids and a house full of pets we go through a lot of spray on cleaners. This brand (resolve) is my brand of choice and I have been using it now for quite some time. I love that I can spray it on a stain (even ones that have completely dried) let it sit for a few minutes and then scrub (or blot) the stain away. As you are cleaning it it does turn a whitish shade but once it dries it goes back to your regular carpet color minus the stain. Will definitely continue buying this product in the future.	1
Keeping 12 year old carpet good as new (we have 5 cats)	1
Product just as described.	1
So, I had used the 401 pet stain on my carpets before as a pre treatment on high traffic area (I have two big dogs) before cleaning them, and it worked amazing. I ran out, and decided to get this one to see how it worked. It really didn't do anything other than create a lot of foam in the carpet cleaner. I thought it would be a good product, but maybe not for what I want it. Will update on how it works on regular carpet stains and hand removal.	-1
UPDATE3  Went back to cascade and have had no problems since.  UPDATE2 My dishwasher leaked all over the floor. We looked and looked and finally found bits of plastic stuck in the drain at the bottom of the machine and even in the holes in the washer arms. I couldn't figure out where it could have come from. Well today I washed my dishes again with one of these tablets. It didn't dissolve completely. The plastic that was left stuck in the cup looked exactly like what I had found clogging the machine. I'm done with these for sure now even though I hate throwing out this expensive product. It would be much more expensive if it totally clogged the motor.  UPDATE The reason the dishes didn't get clean was because the dishwasher packet didn't dissolve. I dried the dishwasher holder thoroughly. I hope that the whole box off cleaners isn't ruined. I put them in a dry place. I wrote the company and they gave me the "you're water's probably not hot enough". Not true. I also used the water heater boost on my dishwasher. I can see the other tablets are appearing to break down. I have them stored in  dry place and I make sure the holder in the dishwasher is perfectly dry and my hands are dry when I touch the tablets. These might work ok someplace where there is no humidity.  I have only used this once, but it works better than the other type of one piece dishwasher detergent. I've used two of the other name brands and I left my dishes dirtier than normal when I used this one and it cleaned better than the others.  UPDATE The  second time I used these I didn't scrape all the food residue from my dishes. The directions said it wasn't necessary. I will probably need to soak and clean the dishes then re-wash them. This didn't work as well as prior products I've used. The first load I washed I had already made sure there was no remaining food. The food this left on seems like it shouldn't have been that hard to get off. Nothing burned on just small amounts of things like spaghetti sauce and peanut butter.	-1
I have three dogs and while all are housebroken, they do have dirty paws, an occasional upchuck and this stuff works beautifully, really does the job.	1
Love RESOLVE...I have used it for years on carpet ---and LAUNDRY!  Boys baseball pants - the clay stains, grass stains, dirt.... does a great job.	1
Works as well as my Lysol wipes	1
We have two cats and this is a must. So far haven't had any stains that this hasn't been able to get out. Always have some of this in our house alone with an extra bottle.	1
works	1
I have two dogs and this works very well	1
Good for cleaning up after my pets.	1
great we love it	1
oh such a wonderful crme..	1
Delivered on time and excellent product.	1
Works great...	1
Good	1
i have always used resolve carpet and will always continue to use it because it really gets the job done. it makes my carpets smell nice and keeps them fresh of an pet odors. it always comes in handy when my dog has an accident on the carpet. i will continue to recommend it to my friends and family!	1
Great for removing toddler stains from clothes!	1
Purchased through prime pantry. Great value. Arrived on time and as described.	1
Takes the stains out.	1
like, but doesn't seem to last as long	1
Smells nice and gets the job done easy. It smells rather like laundry detergent than carpet cleaner	1
Arrived in good condition. We love the product; it work as advertised.	1
These work OK, but smell pretty weird.  I will not purchase again.	-1
These do not smell good and leave your hands smelling kind of icky too. They are almost a bitter, chemical scent. Not lemongrass. The wipe itself is fine so I'll use them until they run out but won't buy again.	-1
I bought these because I wanted to move away from Clorox, both due to animal cruelty issues and wanting to use fewer chemicals. However these wipes smell like motor oil or fuel or something else that is chemically and foul. It's not just me; both my daughters hate them too. Don't buy these if you have a sensitive sense of smell. The odor does dissipate quickly, but not quick enough.	-1
These are so great! I need gentler cleaning products to clean my guinea pig caged and these are perfect. The smell is not overly strong and everything is cleaned well. I am a fan of Seventh Generation, I also enjoy their trash bags.	1
love this stuff	1
My wife loves it!	1
I keep this in my drawer at work to moisturize after every time I go to the bathroom. This does help my hands maintain their level of softness but doesn't do anything to help it. Slightly oily feeling that goes away after a minute or two, which I don't mind. At home, I mix a facial lotion from dry skin with a drop of tarte maracuja oil, which seems to work better at softening my skin but takes longer to absorb. Not sure whether I'd repurchase this product but I do appreciate having it around.	1
Works great.	1
Works as advertised	1
Super product.	1
Great product and it arrived in good condition.	1
Nice	1
GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD PRICE	1
Works well for a good price	1
Great product.	1
This is the best product  that I have  come across	1
wipes	1
These smell awful!  They do not have a fresh, natural smell - they smell of chemicals.  And the scent lingers for a long time.  These are the lemongrass scent - which I thought would have a mild, fresh scent.  Horrible!	-1
The absolute BEST results from any dishwashing detergent EVER. Even badly etched glasses became clear, or nearly so, from the very first use. Cleans tough, very full loads with ease. It will take a miracle for me to switch now, I can't imagine improving on this product. It is as good as it gets.	1
Works great, smells great. Takes out spots from my rug easily.  Also, a better price on prime than in the stores.	1
Received as described & in a timely manner.  Thanks.	1
worked great to get some muddy dog prints up off the carpet.	1
Works well.	1
tried it this morning and it got my stain out!	1
Nice product	1
Great Price and fast shipping!	1
This is one of the only cleaning products that I continue to buy on a continous basis. IT works and it works well.	1
Pricey	1
Really help with carpet stains under the dining room table	1
After having tried just about every other option on the market, these Quantum Powerballs are now my only go-to for my dishwashing needs. They leave no residue in the bin, they clear the tab door (other brands would not dissolve completely and end up stuck in the tab release door creating a huge mess and not cleaning the dishes at all, thus costing me more money as I would have to run the machine again) and they leave my dishes very clean. No streaks on my glasses or silverware and no stuck on food residue on my plates or bowls. I am also pleased on how well they clean my stock pot after I cook spaghetti (there is no foam line on the inside of the pot as other detergents have not been able to remove that line). It also is superb at removing cooked on grease and burnt eggs. I have non-stick pans however other detergent brands have had issues with cleaning my dishes completely so I will be sticking with this Quantum option for as long as it is available.	1
Cream is very soft & light, nice texture.  The smell is a little odd, reminds me of the smell of the permanent solution you smell in beauty salons.	1
This is by far the BEST carpet cleaner I have ever used.  I've tried many other brands, but this works when they don't.  Anyone who uses Resolve knows what I'm talking about.	1
PANTRY	1
Resolve is our favorite spot-treatment cleaner. Toothpaste drips, cat throw-up, feline urine, general spots from daily wear-&-tear...Resolve gets it done. We love it.	1
the wife gets them cheaper with coupons so i will not be buying again	1
I am a regular user of Cascade, but had been hearing about Finish tabs, so I gave them a try after seeing a coupon in the paper for them. My dishwasher is 10 years old and has not held up to the test of time. I don't have much of a problem with baked on pans, but I do have a problem with grit and disgusting debris showing up on my glasses and mostly things on the top rack after a washing cycle. I try to take apart the dishwasher and clean it out every few months, but I haven't been able to do it lately. These tabs do a really good job at reducing the debris. Even when some crumbs made it into the dishwasher, these tabs did a better job than Cascade at keeping glasses clean, and keeping the nasty stuff off. These also work well to prevent the staining of plastic containers that previously contained tomato sauce.  I still use Cascade for some wash cycles and for times when no one wants to wipe the soap receptacle dry (it needs to be dry to use these), but I will mostly be using the Finish tabs from now on.	1
I can't stand the smell.	-1
I love this scent but my husband says it smells like hippys	1
This is absolutely the VERY BEST carpet stain remover that I've EVER used, that I've ever seen a professional carpet cleaner use!  I had a big dark stain on my carpet, didn't know what it was, and NOTHING would take it out no matter what I tried.  I bought Resolve and waited and waited to use it because I didn't want to be disappointed again.  Finally, the stain got the better of me a few days ago, and I got out my Resolve (the product and my own resolve) and I followed the directions, expecting to have to apply these three or four times - if it worked at all.  Well, "Ha-ha!" on me!  It worked the very first time, taking out the stain with almost no effort at all on my part.  It didn't discolor the carpet, it simply took away the stain as if it were magic.  Buy this!  You will love it!	1
great price & great product!	1
keeo ordering it!	1
Arrived in good order.	1
Yooooo! Seriously this cream is heaven sent. About to reload.	1
My favorite lotion by far. Doesn't smell and keeps my skin very soft. I wish it was more affordable though.	1
I think the product is great- good rinsing, stuff looked and felt clean, and no residue or bits of detergent left around.  The packaging stinks. I keep mine in a gallon zip bag as the package doesn't seal up well when the plastic is put 'back together'. It opens up and leaves the little cubes all over the place.  BUT, the product works as expected.	1
I love these things, I'm typically not a water drinker but I'm hooked on these. Man they're so expensive I can't drink them all the time because I can't afford them. Maybe you can get the manufacturer send me a year's supply hahaha	1
good product to keep on hand at work	1
Works good pleasant smell easy to use	1
I am always surprised at how well this relatively inexpensive product works. When I have a stain I tend to want to go for the expensive "professional " products and the steam cleaner but more often then not, a spray of this is all I need.	1
first  time  i have used  a  cleaning  cloth  i can  use  with  my hands  without  gloves---scent  is  lemongrass,  how  lovely  is  that?  cleans  really  well  also.  keep  a  box  in  each  room  for  any  mess,  dustup	1
ammonia smell is not too obnoxious	1
Works but has a very strong odor that I don't find pleasant.  Maybe other folks like it.	-1
these are great and i like knowing i am causing less harm to the environment by using these	1
Great product	1
worked great on my carpet stains.	1
reliable product	1
Great product at a great price	1
Handy product t.o have around when an accident happens	1
They work but they stink! Have a strange odor.	1
You have to get used to the scent at first. We tried other similar brands and came back to these. They are a must to clean off the high chair after meals.	1
We used a rug shampoo machine a very long time ago. Carpet always wet and needed to be dried before cats could walk on it again. With Resolve Carpet Stain Remover in the spray bottle, only that one area of the carpet needs to be cleaned. So only one area gets wet. Cats like this idea very much. If they are happy, we are happy. Plus it gets the stains out better than water only. Smells good.	1
Got rid of some old nasty stains, right before my eyes they were gone, love this product	1
Love, love this water.	1
This product worked perfectly. I had a couple of stains on my carpet and it took them right out. It does not leave a residue that collects dirt from your shoes like some of the other spot carpet cleaners do. I will order again.	1
Thank goodness I got this!  My dog decided to relieve himself on the carper the very next day!  Boy, was I glad I had this!	1
Love this cream for every day use.  It's very soft feeling not heavy at all.  Gives just enough moisturizing without being greasy.  Not a "I need petroleum jelly for my cracked skin" but a really nice moisturizing cream for basic dry skin.  And smells nice too.	1
Very good cleaner!	1
Works well on cat barf, which we seem to have a lot of in this house...	1
I HAVE OLDER PETS NOW AND I'M CONSTANTING CLEANING UP AFTER THEM.  LOVE MY ANIMALS AND DON'T MIND KEEPING UP AFTER THEM.  TRYING OUT THE PRIME PANTRY.  THE PRICE IS GOOD	1
great product.	1
These smell really nice, and to me seem to work just as well as other brands but are a little more eco-friendly. I wish they made them in a biodegradable/compostable variety, but hopefully that will come someday!	1
I truly have to give kudos to this product. I thought I was buying it since we recently brought home another rescue pet and welp; she's having a couple of "wee" issues. To my surprise though, while trimming dog nails the other day on our forest green carpet, I caught one of my dogs quicks and yep; we had some blood on the carpet. Of COURSE being a large baby Huey type dog, he took off and ran around the room and left spots of fresh blood with each step till I called him back and put cornstarch on his nail. Grabbed up this Resolve, gave it a spray and literally watched the stains vanish. WOW. I never expected it. Not that good. I'm sold. Hopefully, won't be accidently cutting my poor 100 pups nails too close (if he'd stay still that wouldnt have happened)...but good to know I finally found a product that does what it says its going to do!	1
Good	1
This is tough stuff. I had a housewarming in my apartment and after some drinking, people were knocking things over left and right. Of course, the soy sauce and hot sauce were the first to go down. It got on people's jackets and all over my new beige carpet. I had several minor heart attacks and then remembered I had a half bottle of Resolve (some spilled in transit but Amazon graciously took care of that). I sprayed some onto the carpet and let it soak for 1-2 minutes. The trick is to double up towels and then scrub away. The stains were gone instantly. Some guests even sprayed Resolve onto their jackets and poof, gone.  I do have to be honest here, I hate the smell. It can linger for days. Before the Resolve dries and after the stain is gone, add some water to the carpet to lighten the smell. Then when it starts drying, spray Febreze like there's no tomorrow.	1
Love the way it takes out stains	1
Very good product. Did wonders for stains on my carpet.  I would purchase this product again.	1
Great for grout cleaning !!	1
I have always had good luck with Resolve Carpet Cleaner getting up whatever spots and stains we end up with, so when I saw this while trying to finish filling a box of "Prime Pantry" products, I didn't hesitate to add it to my order.  Good thing I did too because within a week it earned its keep.  A two-inch long ink mark appeared (was discovered) on our brand new, dove grey living room sofa shortly after a sales rep left.  It was next to where he sat, and pretty much exactly where he placed his clipboard and pen.  Since this was the ONLY time we have been in the living room since the sofa arrived, and only my husband and I have been in the house during this time, there is little doubt in my mind where the mark came from.  Lucky for me, the Resolve Carpet Cleaner and a white washcloth cleaned the mark with little effort and absolutely no fading or piling of the velvet fabric.	1
This thing feels great on the skin. I only use it on my face.	1
My favorite body Cream. Soaks into my alligator skin and soothes. Mild pleasant smell too.	1
Not great	-1
Stronger scent than I'd imagined but I feel safer using this product over some of the similar products that contain harsher chemicals.	1
I don't like the smell but it works	1
Superlative Product	1
Nice product. Trigger makes it easy to spot clean.	1
Decent product...I can recommend it.	1
got it for my mother who has SUPER dry skin. she loves it so I count it as a win	1
Everything about NIVEA Soft Moisturizing Creme is soft. It has a soft, silky consistency that look like marshmallow cream. If feels soft to the touch and feels so soft as I apply it to my skin. And it leaves my skin feeling sooooo soft.  I really like the fragrance. If any of you seniors remember Fan Tan gum, it smells like that. I'll never be able to have the gum again but it's nice to have the aroma of it!  I received a small sample pack of NIVEA Soft from somewhere or other and applied it to my crusty, flaky, old elbows. I was amazed at how soft and smooth they felt right after applying the moisturizing creme. Heck, I was sold and made sure it was in my next Amazon order! And having more than what was in the sample means I can moisturize beyond the elbow!	1
I love the way this smells and it's not greasy at all. I use this as face cream only but I know you can use it on hands and body too.	1
This is really an effective product. I used it on a beige fabric sofa that had some quite noticeable stains, and it actually lifted them and made the fabric look like new again. I just followed the directions, then vacuumed later after it was dried. Have also used it successfully on carpet stains. I'm chemically sensitive and I did not have any reactions while using this though I didn't have direct contact with my hands, and did leave a window open.	1
I bought this to clean my bedroom carpet for the high traffic areas and it worked great. I sprayed it and used a rag with some water and it cleaned up very good.	1
perfect! fast shipping! thanks!	1
Love Resolve carpet stain remover	1
takes dog stains out of carpet... has oxiclean in it!	1
WAYYYYY TOO FRAGRANT it smells soooo bad, gave both my husband and I headaches after just a few sprays of this. Worse still is the SCENT will not come out not even with baking soda. This is terrible. I regret ever spraying this. Now my stuff is ruined. Three days later it still stinks. Not only that this product doesn't work, I think its like febreeze and just covers stains with smells. Gross. Be warned.	-1
Works amazing!!! Had a few show dog pee pee accidents on the light grey carpet.. gone in a few seconds no odor either.	1
used the hell out of this bottle before my carpet cleaner came as I have a puppy with a sensitive stomach.	1
I've been a Cascade complete user for as long as it's been around. This is the first product that has won me over as a convert. I like the convenience, they never get stuck together like some of the Cascade soft pacs do sometimes, and the cleaning is consistent, clear and never any residue or left on matter.  On a per usage basis it was less expensive. I fully support this product, and even if you just want to give it a try on a smaller count, I think you'll be pleased. Of course everyone's water is different so I don't know how much that figures into how well a dishwasher product does or doesn't work.	1
perfect	1
I think this is a great product and I was almost forced to change to this type of bowl cleaner. I had some leakage in the tank and called a plumber. He insist that it was partly due to the drop in tablets I was using in the tank for disinfects. He told me the chemicals were too strong for the seals. I let him make the repairs and i change to this liquid which goes into the bowl only and I have had no additional issues. The scent is very good and the cleaning is just as good.	1
I love lysol wipes and spray and when I say there is a toilet cleaner I ordered right away, it keeps my toilet clean and with no odor.	1
Handy and works well.	1
works great on carpet spots	1
This spray banishes stains on contact. It's works well on ground-in dirt, but is also effective as a pre-treatment before steam-cleaning carpet. The scent disappears/lessens significantly after the product dries. Works very well.	1
Works well	1
This works extremely well for stain removal. One problem I have had over the years is the bottle tends to leak if it tips over in the cabinet (which it seems to be top heavy) and then you find an empty bottle the next time you reach for it. Something to be aware of so you don't lose your product because you will want to use it since it is very effective.	1
this product works pretty fast!  i love it..	1
product really works at pulling out stains if you get them right away will buy again as needed in the future	1
Good	1
Is good but is not do miracles lol is not removed nail paint.	1
I love this stuff. It gets out even old stains. I always keep a bottle of Resolve in my kitchen.	1
This comes in handy when you're cats are acting a fool, your pup is asserting his control over you, or when your roommate couldn't hold it.	1
Great	1
This works well and it smells good. Not like some that smell very harshly!	1
ok	1
I was surprised at how quickly it works on the Toilet Bowl and around the bottom of the Toilet. Smells so fresh and clean. makes cleaning the Toilet a Breeze. Thanks Lysol. And kills germs too !!	1
This new scent smells so fresh. This is the easiest to use & most effective cleaner I have ever used.	1
Perfect - came just as expected - brand new and not damaged or leaking at all.	1
Great price	1
I really like the thought of being more 'environmentally' engaged as a consumer however, this producted misses the ''good sense' marker by-a-mile! It smells like nasty 'rotten hay fields', will never purchase again.	-1
This product was recommend to me by my mom who has a old dishwasher she was so impressed by the cleaning without rinsing. I have a brand new Bosch that came with a sample and I've always used quantum. We run the dishwasher about twice a week and the dishes are always clean even after sitting un-rinsed. I do wash off any chunks or loose food.	1
These are my favorite dishwasher tablets and I have tried all of them.  My dishes always come out cleaner and dryer.  The price on these were unbeatable at the time with a 20% off coupon.	1
great	1
works well	1
loveit	1
Only thing that would be better would be natural ingredients, but the smell is pleasant and the cleaning power is pretty good.  At this time the price is similar to Wal-mart, so faire price.	1
I've been using another brand for years with OK usually-acceptable results.  Decided to give these a try, and I'm glad I did. They really are better than my old brand. I'm single, and don't dirty many dishes, and I don't like running the dishwasher unless I have a full-ish load. This means that dishes may sit in the dishwasher for a week. This stuff does the best job of getting rid of all that stuck-on crud.  Will definitely purchase again.	1
Just used this week! good product!	1
Great tasting sparkling water. Its thirst quenching.	1
By far the best and better for you	1
Too soapy.	1
We started to shop for a new dishwasher because the dishes were no longer coming fully clean. There were some stains that just didn't completely clean off, and none of the detergents we tried were completely satisfactory. One of my wife's friends mentioned that she was going to buy a new dishwasher but she happened to try Finish and was amazed at the results. We bought a pack, and just stuck one of these colorful little soft squares in the soap dispenser. I had my doubts, but turned on the dishwasher and went off. The next morning, my wife opened the dishwasher and began checking the dishes. She was amazed at the difference, and said that we could stop shopping for a dishwasher. The difference was startling and I was excited at saving $400! I never thought I would care about dishwasher detergent, but this stuff is great!! If you are shopping for a dishwasher for this reason spend a few bucks for Finish and you will be amazed. Oh, and do not store these under the sink or anywhere little hands can reach them as they look very much like little pieces of candy...we keep them in an upper cabinet.	1
Good and keeps clean.	1
does the job	1
I normally use the Lysol with the bleach but since it was not available as one individual bottle in Prime Pantry, I chose this type. Lysol continues to make a great product and cleans my toilet bowls with little effort.	1
It's toilet cleaner. It works. It makes the toilet cleaner. It smells fresh!	1
Sinks in quickly and does not leave an oily or shiny residue or appearance on skin. The 6.8 ounce tub is generously sized and reasonably priced (prices vary). My only quibble is the fragrance. It is not offensive (sort of a generic fabric softener) but I would prefer no scent.  Every product seems to have their own fragrance and Id rather select one to wear than juggle the assortment of scents infused in everything from make-up, hair products, body wash, lotions, deodorants etc. I wish more fragrance-free options were available, but no point in holding this soft light cream accountable for a much larger issue. The cream is very pleasant to use, especially in summer when, in the heat, anything too heavy is uncomfortable.	1
Ok	1
Works well.  Nice scent.	1
Good for cleaning up hands when water isn't around. Easy on your skin too.	1
I really like this, I never drink soda.  Try it.	1
Caused major etching on all my glass plates and dishes, I'm so upset. Never had any problems before using these awful tablets. I will NEVER use these again, I will use the liquid detergent.	-1
Not only does this clean your toilet but it will also clean the rim on your bathtub, especially those surround types.  I use it on my sons tub and walk away, come back later run the shower, rinse, presto, no bath water rings.	1
Good thanks	1
Great product. Works very well on hard toilet stains and is easy to use.	1
Product as described - Fast Shipping - Very Satisfied!!!	1
one of the best cleaners honestly	1
OMGoodness!!!  I LOVE this cream.  I don't like creams or lotions that leave a greasy feeling.  This cream is thick; it quickly soaks into your skin, leaving a fresh scent!  It can be used on the body, face and hands.  I dilute it with a little water for my face.  The cream has done wonders for my skin!!!	1
Great	1
great for smelly toilets.	1
Works great	1
Item as described.	1
Loved It!	1
Works really well and fast !	1
Not fond of plastic bottles but ordering the glass bottles is more expensive, plus shipping all that glass is dicey. I love pelegrino and had to change my review because I said it was, how do you say, like a drug that you can't stop taking?	1
A must for the toilet ball, to be used daily.	1
This doesn't smell like typical toilet bowl cleaner and that is why I love it. It has a nice scent so when cleaning the toilet I can smell something somewhat pleasant instead of chemicals that burn my nose.	1
LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I PUT IT IN MY TOILET BOWL EVERYNIGHT WHEN I GO TO BED AND WAKE UP TO A SUPER CLEAN TOILET BOWL.	1
Just what I was looking for!  Great product!!	1
Great!	1
Works good	1
not real impressed, but thought I'd try it.	1
I have raised 10 children having as many as 5 bathrooms in my homes.  Keeping up with the bathrooms has always been an issue with 10 children, now 9 grandchildren, and all the folks they bring through the house.  I've tried a lot of toilet bowl cleaners in the last 50 years and never come across one I can say I like near as well.  I've bought a lot of products that claim they are "gels" and "stick" only to get them home to find they aren't much more gel like than tap water, and stick they did not.  Can't say that about Lysol Cling Gel Toilet Bowl Cleaner.  I can go from bathroom to bathroom squirting all the way around each toilet bowl and then go back to the first to find it still "clinging" all the way from the rim to the bottom.  It does just what it says.  A quick brush and a flush of each toilet and they are all sparkling clean.	1
This toilet cleaner is one of the best there is. Leaves a nice scent and a shiny toilet. I was a great price when I purchased it too!	1
Seventh Generation - one of my favorite safe and responsible brands!  First time I'm trying their wipes and would recommend them to anybody who is looking for a healthier alternative to the regular old Lysol, Clorox, etc. (bleach is no good)	1
Great product and seller in every aspect! Thank you!	1
I absolutely LOVE these, there is no telling how many of these I have purchased over the years! Its an earth-friendly product that also sanitizes! I use these on EVERYTHING, wiping the counters if there has been raw meat on them, wiping the surface of something a mouse has been on, cleaning my car, wiping off door knobs, cleaning my coolers out etc.! These are great, and I definitely recommend!	1
This is my go to toilet bowl cleaner. Love the scent when used and as always, cleans like a dream. I also enjoy the gel clinging, so when you have a stubborn spot, it sticks.	1
I recently purchased my first bottle of Lysol Country Scent Cling Gel and have found that it does a good job of cleaning the  toilet bowls in my home.  I haven't encountered any of the staining problems some reviewers have reported and have used this product in three different brands of toilet fixtures (Kohler, Gerber and Toto).  However, in comparing this to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Clorox-Toilet-Bowl-Cleaner-With-Bleach-Clean-Scent-Bottle-24-Oz/dp/B007MGN18I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Clorox Toilet Bowl Cleaner With Bleach Clean Scent Bottle 24 Oz</a>, which is the toilet bowl cleaner I had previously used, I can tell you that there is significantly more dye in this Lysol product than there is in the Clorox.  This Lysol was available through Prime Pantry at a great price so I decided to give it a try.  It costs a dollar less here on Amazon than it costs from my local grocery store.  I really can't tell any difference in performance or cleaning effectiveness between these two brands (Clorox and Lysol).  Both are thick and cling to the sides of the bowls as you would expect.  I have no complaints or concerns to share and will continue purchasing this Lysol product as long as I can get it for such a great price through Amazon Prime Pantry.  I purchased this in October of 2014 and paid $1.97 for the 24 oz bottle.  Shipping was included with my Prime Pantry order.	1
MY FAVORITE BOWL CLEANER DOES SUPERB  JOB.I HAVE USED THIS GOING OVER 20 YEARS. SIMPLY EASY TO USE. IM A GUY.	1
A little too much scent when applying, but it fades fairly quickly. Went on easily and absorbed quickly.	1
I can get this locally, but I have been enjoying using Prime, for the convenience of having dry groceries delivered, particularly as the weather gets colder.  This item is at advertised.	1
Nice cleaner, scrubs easily.  The bottle is also easy-open and no-spill.	1
GREAT PRODUCT	1
Holds all those important docs to the frig door	1
is on a good price at amazon and its do the work.	1
Love Lysol.	1
Great!	1
So far I really like the Lysol Cling Gel Toilet Bowl with the country scent cleaning power. It is so easy to use. Just squirt the Lysol Bowl Cleaner all around the upper part of the toilet bowl and use a brush to scrub the ring.  It cleans so well. And it is so easy.	1
IT WORKS	1
I buy these in bulk.  Fresh smell, great cleaning power.  Highly recommend.	1
excellent	1
Gives me a horrible headache every time. Looked it up and apparently this can be caused by the nitrates used in sparkling water?	-1
My skin does not like this product! I never used to have breakouts, and ever since I tired this, Ive been having them. After a week of using it, I stopped using it and the breakouts stopped.	-1
I wash my hands multiple times a day and they get really dry and cracked. My cuticles are always splitting and I hate it. I love this lotion! my hands are soft and they have moisture and my cuticles look much better. Will be buying this again!	1
Very nice value, but a less carbonated than expected. I do love the size. I like mine with a little lemon and my family likes to add flavored syrups for Italian sodas.	1
I love this water and They Care enough to make sure the bottles are BPA free.	1
Perfect !	1
I use these a lot.	1
POSITIVES Easy to use and streak free cleaning and disinfecting wipes all in one Strong Soft feeling to the touch Great for easy cleaning -- toilet, sink, counter, tiles, door knobs, faucet, shower head, cabinet surfaces 70 wipes are in the tub and they pull up for you to take out one at a time very easily with the built in dispensor top Very light thyme type scent -- not overpowering -- smells like an herbal clean Foam up slightly initially but dry without any residue Cleaning product that is natural and not unhealthy which is very important to us Texture of the cloths is nice and thick to create a barrier between you and the area being cleaned Really cuts through grease (great for clean up of the stove after cooking)  HINT Great for quick clean up and spring cleaning  HIGHLY RECOMMEND Seventh Generation Disinfecting wipes	1
One of the best ingredient for drinks and fine dining.	1
Great product.	1
This product does a great job and it's gentle to my skin.	1
Great value and a nice change from flat water which I prefer.	1
USE THIS ALL THE TIME.	1
good	1
it's s pellegrino sparkling water, what do you want me to say?	1
Great size to carry for lunch. Refreshing.	1
reliable taste and quality	1
The taste is awesome!  It has to be good when my 4yr old will ask for it when she wants water. Pleasantly refreshing... I prefer having plastic bottles over glass... don't have to worry that the lil one will drop it while drinking.	1
I cleaned my bathroom sink with these wipes today.  I had no chemical reaction like no redness in my hands no sneezing I didn't have to open a window to let fresh air in to get rid of a medicinal smell and they cleaned all the toothpaste, hair and soap residue right up.  I am going to try them on my tub next.	1
Work as well as more toxic options	1
Does a good job of cleaning.	1
Love this sparkling water, came really fast!	1
Love Pelegr&iacute;n, I thought this was a good buy. Nice to get it with Amazon groceries.	1
Good product, fast shipping, good price. Would buy from again.	1
We order these regularly!	1
great product	1
I'm sorry, this tastes like dirty pool water to me. A little fizzy, but dirty. Eeew.	-1
SUCCESSFULLY CUTTED MY DIET COKE BECAUSE OF THIS.	1
Ive been using these for the bathroom sinks and these get them nice and clean. I really HATE the smell though! Please add some smell good to it for heavens sake!!	1
Great for cleaning off headphones between uses by different people and they are all natural so that is a good thing too.	1
I have seen this product in stores a few time and decided to buy it from Amazon.  I love the way it cleans.  Each wipe stays moist the whole time I have used it.  I have been able to scrub a little hard with the wipe and it has not fallen apart.  My only down side to this product is the smell.  It really a strong scent and bothers my allergies.  I do over look this because it cleans so well.	1
Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics trade association, has told its members to remove MI from products that are left on the skin after explosion in cases of allergic reactions and eczema. Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT), is routinely added to moisturizers, sun creams, shampoos and wet wipes. Skin experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of allergic reactions they believe are caused by MI chemical. In UK, symptoms ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face. It is not important where any cream is made; any cream with Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT) is not an EU cream. Now read the last ingredient of this cream... Methylisothiazolinone.	-1
Nivea cream is very soothing and good after a clean shave. This product can also be used on your arms and legs after a hot bath. The cream is greaseless and does not leave a slippery feeling on your skin. It has a good smell great just before going to bed.	1
Cleans well....leaving a refreshing scent.	1
I wish I could drink mineral water every day. I love this stuff. This is my favorite brand--high quality mineral water.	1
Nice water. I enjoy it. I prefer Perrier water but this is my back up. It seems to have fewer bubbles; Perrier sort of stings the back of my throat' this doesn't. So you choose. Both are great waters' if you don't like that little sting San pelligrino is for you. Both are 5 stars!	1
Love this water. Great price too.	1
I uses this Nivea Soft under my foundation during the day and as a moisturizer at night.  The one in the Dark Blue jar is a bit thick but is good for softening elbows and heels.	1
Great take along for soccer games.	1
Very good product.  We had a new puppy and were concerned about keeping his area clean without using harmful products. These wipes did the trick. No offensive odor and kept areas on the floor and kitchen surfaces very clean.  I like the product and would buy it again.	1
I LOVE this stuff! I have used it for a couple years now, and I'd be VERY sad if I couldn't find it. Good ol Amazon! I use it to the VERY last ans it's easy to do that in these practical tubs. LOVE IT!!!	1
.Pretty flavorless.  If I didn't know any better, I'd think it was just water and bubbles.	1
Great price	1
I purchased for my dorm and these are a must for a college kid , cleans up all my messes and doesn't leave stains	1
Like the scent, don't like the design. It must be really hard to come up with packaging that doesn't allow moisture to escape - the wipes dry out if you don't use them all within a few months.	-1
I use this sh*t on everything!	1
These wipes work well and clean and disinfect most surfaces. I use them on my stove top, my sink area, door knobs, phone, and toilet area. One goes a long way. That said, the smell is not bad at all. Just be sure to price check locally before ordering online. Now that Amazon must collect sales tax in many states, you might be able to obtain it locally at a lower or compatible price.	1
They are good.	1
Good wipes	1
I use a lot of Seventh Generation products, but I had to throw out these disinfecting wipes because they smell bad. Not bad like bleach, or ammonia, or Lysol wipes, just strongly funky, more like drain cleaner.	-1
I started drinking a lot more mineral water to help with soda cravings. I haven't had any soda in over a month and sometimes I just want some bubbles. I only drink water btw so regular water and once in a while some mineral water. I will say that comparing this to Perrier, I prefer the Perrier more.	1
Convenient, makes cleaning a breeze and you KNOW things are clean after using them!	1
Got to have when your OCD and hate germs... lol really leaves everything clean and fresh	1
Love these wipes, the smell is very refreshing.	1
Worked as expected.	1
Very convenient clean up.	1
AAA	1
Moving soon. These are essential for disinfecting. I love the clean smell and knowing that whatever I wipe with these will be clean!	1
Works well	1
Always a good choice!	1
never having till now loving it	1
Nice price for these very useful wipes. :)	1
great	1
Wonderful and great deal	1
These are always the perfect clean up wipe. Fast shipping!	1
I have a lot of allergies and this product has been great - no reaction at all.	1
good	1
Love the convenience of these wipes and their disinfecting power.	1
I love using this brand	1
Good for keeping the counters clean.  nice fresh scent.	1
I am a caregiver and my clients are not always have the best hygiene.  I leave a canister of Lysol Disinfecting Wipes on the back on the toilet for convenience. I feel terrible if someone comes and it was not clean for them.  Plus it is so convenient to pull one out and quickly clean up any misses.  They stay fresh and wet to use.  Pleasant smelling.	1
Tried using them twice they clean things up but I just couldn't stand the smell. It was so bad I toss them	-1
Great value, excellent quality, amazing price. really happy.	1
I have been a Pellegrino fan for years for its wonderful carbonation and clear taste. I use this not just as a drink but also for aiding digestion and relieving the symptoms of leg cramps from recurring (this is a well known benefit by many in Europe). While I do prefer the glass bottles, these plastic bottles are easier for transport.	1
love this stuff.	1
Very nice scent and clean very well.	1
These wipes are really good value and very convenient. I like that they are an easy to grab and easy to use solution for wiping down many surfaces - counter tops, trash can lids, sinks, even spills on the floor or door handles etc. They are very multi-use. They smell pleasant without being overpowering, and each wipe is a good size. They are also easily disposible. I was disappointed to learn that in order to kill heavy duty germs and bacteria, the wipe needs to be in contact with the given area for en extended period of time (10 minutes?!) - and I can't see myself doing that. I would use vinegar or bleach or something else! However, to "sanitize" and give a good basic clean, these wipes are great. I would recommend them, and I will buy again.	1
I love that I can feel confident that my surfaces are clean and safe for my kiddos after using these wipes. I won't buy any other brand! They smell good too.	1
I use these for every day cleaning needs and it does the job without a strong eye watering smell.	1
Shipped quickly and was just as described.	1
Great deal	1
Just as expected = thank you.	1
These are super convenient for quick clean up in the bathroom during the week in between real cleaning. Especially in a house with males of any age!   They're also great during cold, flu and strep throat season for wiping down the doorknobs, remotes, cabinet and drawer handles, faucets levers - pretty much anything that is touched by human hand. Send a tub (or two) with your kids to school or daycare, I'm sure their teachers will appreciate it!	1
Water is water, but not all waters are created equal. San Pellegrino isn't just sparking water, the mineral content gives it a crisp, refreshing taste, much like how Evian water is more refreshing because of its mineral content. I've been trying to cut back on sodas, and this water is the best replacement for them I've found. Really the only downside is that it comes in a bottle instead of a can, but the price can drop as low as 50 per bottle, and that's cheaper than the tap water of Aquafina.	1
Cleans well and smells great!	1
LOVE IT, WOULD BUY AGAIN. PERFECT!!!	1
Awesome quick clean upl have them in kitchen and bathrooms for quick wipe downs	1
Works Great!	1
I had to wet them again.  There is nothing to keep them from drying out.	1
great for parties	1
Love it!!	1
easy to use, wipe clean. I use the mop because but i need to wash the mop, this one is so easy not need to wash.	1
I love this product it keeps the germs down. it is also a good cleaner with craft products as well.	1
We use these everywhere. I love that they are flushable and more of a "natural" product.	1
When Seventh Generation say their scented products should smell like "Lemongrass Citrus", it's more like Clean Well's well-known scent of thyme. I like it how it remains very moist and wet throughout the cleaning process. I feel like I am not wasting and it doesn't make my hands feel ultra dry like Clorox Green Works wipes and Lysol generic disinfecting wipes.  I have several issues with the seller's page, however... first, the ingredients aren't listed and the back of the canister is totally different from the seller's page. I took a picture of the correct one, which lists all of the inactive ingredients. Users and customers beware: Yes, this product does contain SLS's -- the company doesn't indicate that it is vegetable derived or specifies. It also doesn't say whether or not it is tested on animals or it's cruelty free. Although on both Seventh Generation and Clean Well websites, state that their ingredients are vegetarian friendly, and cruelty free.  Their inactive ingredients as follows: water, SLS, bluestone, citric acid, sodium citrate, and essential oil fragrances (origanum vulgare, cymbopogon nardus, and cymbopogon schoenanthus with citral -- a component of these essential oils).	1
I keep one can in the car, one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen.  They are effective and smell clean	1
The perfect drnk and size to carry in my back pack to work	1
Love this product, just wish the bottles were glass instead of plastic.	1
Love this Sparkling Water.  The Highest Quality in Blessed. Safe Plastic bottles.  Treat yourself, impress your friends and relatives!  Even your MOM will think you are a millionaire with this high quality beverage through Prime Pantry.  Superior Pantry Box.  FedEx Man brought it right inside my Assisted Living Apartment in downtown Orlando, saluted me and left.  I almost passed out with joy!!!!!  The last time I used Prime Pantry in Mount Dora and Tavares, FL. they took it to the wrong street address and I had to go with my "little red wagon" and haul it home.  Not easy for an elderly gent with only 1 lung and 1/2 heart ... and those are the least of my problems!  We are Orlando Strong!	1
Great!!!	1
Happy with the purchase as it is a subscribe and save item, but I will skip the next delivery due to a price hike of over $5.  Water taste fine with pleasant bubbles.	1
This is one of my favorite mineral waters. I became addicted to it in Europe and glad it's sold in the US. It's not as acidic as Perrier! It also helps with digestion!	1
I enjoy San Pellegrino, especially when I'm trying to avoid wine--or at least not drink too much when I'm with friends. It makes drinking water a little more special and reminds me of being in Italy, where I drank a lot of it.	1
this was delicious.	1
Pellegrino is just the best.	1
Just what I ordered and expected to receive	1
THE best cleaners.	1
The lid dispenser on this product are cumbersome and never work as expected, but I like the product for quick clean ups.	1
This Italian water is exceedingly refreshing, and each container is a good size to quench an individual's thirst.  There are no poisons, toxins, sugars or other harmful elements in this water.	1
I love sparkling water and I hate saying perrier so I drink this.	1
the best	1
Good stuff	1
like store	1
Skinny little containers.  Don't be fooled.  You are not getting the equivalent of four containers.  Two containers probably hold less than one large container at the supermarket.	-1
Item as described! cvpnj.com	1
Light fresh citrus pepper like scent. Smells clean and does break up grease and jelly easy. I got for my son's high chair tray. It doesn't need to be rinsed after washing a food contact surface which is great and it's pretty much all natural... bonus. Big container. Closes well so keeps wipes wet. Seventh generation makes quality items. Cheaper than most box stores...plus free 2 day shipping....saving gas and time.....Win win	1
What's good about Seventh Generation wipes is that you don't have to rinse your counters a couple times afterward. I still prefer wiping my counters with water and a paper towel, but when you need something more, this is the brand to pick.	1
Like this water because of its sulfite content.	1
a little salty for my taste but refreshing bubbles	1
I have been drinking sparkling mineral water for years, in place of carbonated drinks filled with sugar. It was wonderful to have these items delivered to my door.	1
THIRST QUENCHER	1
Got this for my clients - for those who are picky.	1
It works	1
Use these to clean almost everything	1
As Expected, as Promised, All is good with this Seller!	1
Nice "small bubbles" very refreshing and clean tasting.	1
I prefer the glass but these are fine especially for the price.	1
Needed some sparking water to fix my mixed drinks. These were perfect.	1
Great, it was exactly what I wanted.	1
Great price on Amazon for these wipes. I love that they are safe enough for baby to eat off of the surface after wiping. I'm pleased with seventh Gen Products.	1
Kinda high	1
Best deal and so nice-right to door.	1
We are glad this is offered by Amazon and have been told it may help you meet your daily fluid needs to stay hydrated. Fluids, such as carbonated water, are said to possibly help the fiber work better in your gut and make stools normal and regular.	1
love of course :)	1
Great to have around for guests, a cocktail or when my son wants "bubble water".	1
tastes great	1
These are good all purpose wipes and they smell good.	1
I thought I was fortunate to find this product, very nice tasting and just the right amount of CO2	1
Product is fantastic . . .just LOOK AT THE #'S!  Can't believe I paid such a high price for so little . . .not my fault . . .cataracts did it!	1
Perfectly satisfied with this purchase.	1
I keep these at my desk, in my "bathroom purse" at work...  in my everyday purse, in the bathroom at home, in my car,, everywhere.  I use them more and more, so I order a 3-pack every 2-weeks.	1
Wish this was less expensive really good would recommend.	1
Great stuff. Watch the grocery store. You may find it cheaper there.	1
will always be my favorite	1
Great product.	1
I use these everyday on my computer keypad, cell phone, and throughout the house on door knobs and fridge handles, etc during flu season. It works great! I like it better than Lysol and other sprays because they affect my asthma.	1
I'm obsessed with these guys. These wipes are good quality and they smell nice. I wash the counters then go over it with these wipes to disinfect anything left behind. They leave my sink nice and shiny and no left over marks. The towels are strong enough to scrub food off counter or stove and they don't rip, it might be a little difficult to rip. They have a good amount of wipes per bottle but since I use so many they run out fast, so I get the 3 pack.	1
LOVE THE FRESH SMELL OF THIS PRODUCT!!	1
Just what I was looking for!  Great product!!	1
I love Pellegrino water.  The taste is marvelous and it seems to quench my thirst really well.	1
My son loves this stuff! Better than sodas from a can with all that sugar and dye.	1
Very good multi-surface wipes	1
a very good Italian sparkling water! I prefer , however, the German sparkling water!	1
I have always kept a package of wipes in the grand children's diaper bag and in the bathroom with their potty.  Otherwise, I have never been a big fan of wipes.  I ordered these as part of a Prime Pantry order (if you don't have a Prime Membership which makes Prime Pantry available to you, you are seriously missing out).  I ordered just in time for the Ebola scare that had me wiping exterior door knobs etc. frequently and for the flu to sweep through the household having me wiping interior surfaces constantly.  These wipes smell great, clean great, and had me feeling a whole lot more confident about germ control in a household with 10 adult children and 9 grandchildren going through constantly.	1
Great products with Lysol.  These wipes are  no exception!	1
These are great for baby toys	1
I use these on everything and they leave a clean feeling and pleasant scent on everything.	1
I use many seventh generation products.  I use non toxic products whenever I can and these wipes serve that purpose for my home.	1
These are excellent wipes. I do not have a lab and cannot say exactly how well they disinfect, but they are easy on my very sensitive skin, and they clean and shine as well as if not better than the toxic leader brands.  Somebody has to have a way to do this without plastic.	1
A family member brought these home to try. Like them for special jobs in which you don't want to dirty a sponge or cleaning rag and want to throw the wipe away after using it. The citrus is a pleasant scent and smells fresh. Use these especially in the kitchen and bathrooms. They make cleaning up easy. I primarily use a biodegradable, more natural cleaner spray for regular cleaning jobs, but these are great when you want to throw the wipe away.	1
These wipes are an all around great thing to have around the house. They clean well and leave little streaking. The surface will be wet for a while after using them though.	1
I could build a museum proving this never happened.	1
the best of all water products...will always have it in stock in our home....el fed	1
Love this water, has high calcium and magnesium levels compared to other mineral waters and isn't too salty. And, what makes it even better- buying it on amazon for 2$ a liter bottle and getting it delivered for free instead of trying to hulk this box of water from the store.	1
Essential too my daily clean up rituals.	1
There is no substitute for this water love it and now that I can get it on Amazon just makes life easier.	1
Have been buying these while on vacation to mix with vegetable-fruit fusion drinks. The added Pellegrino sparkling water dilutes the calories and fruit sugar of the juices, and adds a bit of refreshing texture and taste. Just add ice for a cool, refreshing, healthy substitute for sodas.	1
This San Pellegrino Sparkling Mineral Water, has minerals that you can't find in a regular bottle of water, it taste nice and it's very healthy, I try to drink this mineral water every single day but it's also expensive to not drink just plane water.	1
Have tried several brands. The volunteers that clean our church prefer this brand. It doesn't have a strong bleach oder and cleans.	1
I have a couple parrots that are mostly potty-trained, but they do occasionally have small accidents. These wipes are perfect for cleaning up little messes like that, and I also love them for wiping down the counters every once in a while. I don't prepare meat in my kitchen, but still...vegetables can be covered in bacteria, too.  The scent of these wipes is light and pleasant, though I kind of thing plain lemon would be better than the lemon-lime fragrance. Still, that's a very minor complaint. I like that the wipes come out easily and provide a very quick and convenient way to sanitize a surface from time to time. I'm not a total germaphobe so I don't use them every day - but when I need them, they're there. I go through one of these three-packs roughly once every 4 or 5 months, but I suspect a family with small children would use them much faster.	1
I like having disinfecting wipes in my kitchen and bathrooms so I can do the quick clean-ups through out the day and know that I've gotten the germs also. I have always liked the fresh smell that lemon gives when it's in a cleaning product. So not only do I keep my bathrooms cleaned during the day I also leave them along with the kitchen smelling fresh and as germ-free as possible.	1
Great price and last longer	1
Effective, plenty wet, smells nice and terrific for disinfecting babies' room because of no harmful chemicals!	1
excellent	1
Exactly what I wanted.	1
my local stores have the smaller glass bottles...These are he bigger plastic version..I don`t see any great difference in quality so I will get it here on Prime and not need to lug it from store and get more for $ ! thanks Prime	1
great price and quick delivery	1
great product	1
Never fails to be perfect. I love Barilla pasta. It tastes like the pasta I had in the North End when I lived in Boston. It holds a nice al dente bite.	1
I love this water and I saw it at Panara the other day and spent about 2.50 for 1 bottle! Much less expensive through Amazon! It is not only great for keeping hydrated, but just for a drink of water!	1
I have subscribe and save, wonderful clean up tool	1
quick shipping, great item!!!	1
I like this product. I live in a rural area & find Prime Pantry convenient. Good prices & fair flat rate shipping.	1
Not a bad deal for pantry order.	1
Good pasta.	1
Pasta is the daily food I like its taste of this brand, but I hope they can supply the big packages with more cheaper price	1
Excellent product.	1
Pasta preference is a matter of taste so all I can say is we like it and started buying it here because the food store jacked the price up about 30-percent. I also like that by adding a little oil to the water I can dispense with rinsing it and thats a real plus. At about a buck a box its worth buying it here and it helps fill out that Pantry box.	1
great	1
New Customer!	1
as a shut in this helps me to get a few items I need without bothering people to go to the store	1
Follow the directions and Barilla turns out good pasta dependably every time.	1
Its fricking pasta and it tasted good what more to say?	1
Cooks up well and never have a problem	1
Penne pasta has been the pasta of our choice around our house for years.  I grew up eating spaghetti noodles but have since switched to these.  Excellent choice for homemade Alfredo sauce.  I will keep purchasing these!	1
Very good product, will definitely buy again!	1
Tastes good to me!  Just as expected, really.	1
Our dinner that I made with this Penne was delicious.	1
We eat this pasta all the time. It's the best and only pasta my hubby will eat. YUM!!	1
Takes the edge off around the kitty litter, basement, bathroom, car, laundry room, under the kitchen sink. On and on. Love it	1
This was smashed!	-1
Great brand, tastes fresh every time I use it.  After I've had this won't go back to store brand despite cheaper price. Such a difference!	1
ok	1
good price	1
always great products from barilla	1
Excellent for the crock pot.	1
Arrived on time and as described.	1
Great service, first time to try this product and it is NOT for me, but no fault of seller, just a weird smell to the cloths...guess I am not really a "naturalist"??  Fast delivery.  Thank you.	1
Works great. String thyme smell.	1
Stinks so bad. Even if they worked good, the smell is aweful and it lingers all day.	-1
wonderful	1
Barilla never disappoints in it's pasta and this is no exception.	1
You can't get better dry pasta brands, we love it and its the only brand we have in our pantry.	1
I love this brand of pasta.	1
It's pasta, what's not to love? Got here on time.	1
Real barilla penne at a good price!!!	1
great	1
good	1
Good sized amount of pasta for a dinner for 4	1
very happy with my purchase!	1
great pasta	1
Taste like other pasta, would be cheaper if bought at the store	1
as expected	1
Good product.	1
Best boxed penne on the market. I boil for 11 minutes at sea level for the perfect texture.	1
I use these daily - they're so handy! For the longest time I was using paper towels and spray but this is so much more convenient. I got a couple and keep them in danger zones that quickly get dirty/dusty.  I would caveat that I'm not crazy about the smell but I don't recall there being a lot of options on Amazon prime pantry.  Clean house = happy me. I will be buying again.	1
Have used these for years - happy to see them in Prime Pantry at a good price.	1
Takes time and its worth it. Does not go mushy just edible.	1
ALWAYS GOOD TO THE LAST BOWL!!..CR/LVNV	1
Good brand.	1
Tastes great and arrived without any shipping damage	1
Good	1
Thank you	1
Good with meatballs.	1
Barilla Pasta is always good...and even better when you can get a special price on it on Amazon!	1
These Lysol disinfecting wipes have a  great texture for cleaning!  Love them.	1
CLEAN AND NO GERMS	1
pasta is pasta.  this is fine.	1
Gee, pasta is pretty much pasta but this is on brand that if you like the first box you buy, you will like every subsequent box.	1
awesome	1
good	1
Daughter says she loves pasta and this one in particular is always tasty and cooks perfectly to al dente in 11 minutes.	1
Tastey!  Cooked up nice!	1
good!	1
A tasty staple! Not much else to be said other than when the apocalypse hits I'll be glad I stocked up on this stuff.  All jokes aside I use Barilla pasta in most of my pasta dishes as its super cheap, easy, and trusted.  I'm sure it actually would be great in an apocalyptic situation too tho ;)	1
great	1
Really good pasta, loved it.	1
Good	1
good stuff	1
Great pasta. Great price!	1
It's pasta... Got for a good price.	1
Good pasta.	1
I love this product - it attacks greasy stuff in the kitchen as well as germs in the bath.  A wonderful overall cleaner whether you use the spray or the wipes.  I was actually amazed at the first time I used it to clean the microwave and greasy cabinets and appliances in the kitchen - that was a spray bottle - so I'm getting these 6 pack of wipes with absolute confidence.  Their dish soap is tremendously powerful as well.	1
Nice fragrance, great cleaning and gentle on my hands.	1
Great pasta!	1
I love this brand, and their paste tastes good.	1
Do not buy these wipes, they smell awful. I used these to clean a spill and now I cannot even sit in the room. The smell is making me sick to my stomach. I expect more from Seventh Generation. What a waste.	-1
I loved this stuff for years, bought it in bulk on subscribe and save, used it constantly for everything. Then learned it has chemicals that are toxic to aquatic life. Among other things. Check out EWG. So I cancelled my scrip and am trying a Charlie's product, or going back to microfiber cloth and water.	-1
I read the reviews about the terrible scent and figured they must be exaggerating, it can't be that bad.  So I ordered a pack of 6 and used subscribe and save with the intention of continuing to buy this item.  Guess what?  The scent is really bad! No exaggeration! Suggest you try one pack only from the store before investing in 6 from Amazon. Note the 6 pack I received states:  New Lemongrass Citrus Scent.  I don't think so.	-1
Prefer wheat Pasta	-1
Only one star because who like to have to need this!	-1
Smashed product not happy.....	-1
When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!	-1
Used to like it, but Barilla has come out as a homophobic company; so I'll never buy it again.	-1
Didn't really seem to work that well for me.	-1
"Ketchup with vegetable chunks" is what we called this. Mild = mild apparently! LOL	-1
Looked great! Could not eat it	-1
Individual bags crushed to crumbs inside the Pantry Box.  No damage to outside of box.	-1
Why would you put this item in with bottles of ketchup, mayo, jelly, peanut butter, and other heavy products when the box had a center area with NOTHING in it.. I did not get Scoops, I got crushed.  Guess I can't order anything that will get crushed from now on.....	-1
Vile.  Everyone who wrote how delicious this is?  You owe me a refund.  I couldn't even choke down one can, and I ordered two different flavors.  Too heavy to return, so I poured them all down the sink and recycled the cans.	-1
Wrong picture displayed, very disappointed; My favorite chips are the ones you replaced. Not buying ever again	-1
I like potato chips--too much. I have always loved these potato chips in particular.  But this bag must have gotten a triple salting, because it was so salty as to be inedible.	-1
TY	-1
Came opened, do not order this if you live high above sea level, it will explode on the way over!	-1
Crushed and broken through Pantry. Just go to the store. Yummy stuff thought	-1
They arrived in great condition, but they taste revolting!  They have almost no corn flavor.  The initial bite is crispy, but, as soon as you start chewing them, they turn chalky in both taste and texture.  These are some of the worst corn chips we've ever tasted!	-1
They were all nothing but crumbs when I received them.	-1
As others have said broken in a million pieces.	-1
They were CRUSHED LIKE MY DREAMS WHEN I OPENED THE BAG TO FIND UNSCOOPABLE CHIPS FOR MY GAUC	-1
Love these chips but will not order again because bag popped open and chips were broken.	-1
I love Frito Lay chips but, every time I receive my order it looks like the bags had been stuffed into the package. So, I expected the whole chips to be crushed.  They were.  Nothing to dip. Except the Fritos of course.  They will outlast any chip.	-1
A gift	-1
Not as good as the banana flavor but a great protein to calorie ratio and very nice creamy texture.	-1
arrived totally smashed in a prime pantry box	-1
I can honestly say I was disappointed with this.  I normally love Frito Lay but the amount of chips in each bag was just disgraceful.  Sure they all tasted great but what the hell... am I paying partially for air?  One of the bags had a total of literally... 7 chips.  7 freaking chips.  I mean come on.  Get your act together Frito-Lay.  2 stars only because they still tasted great.  But man I wanted to give 1 because of the poor numbers in each bag.	-1
poor flavor	-1
2 Stars: "I don't like it."  The two stars are for the protein and lower carb. Taking away 3 stars is for the 1. slimy gross texture and 2. icky taste. This was not a tasty protein shake.  But if you can just guzzle it down, are okay with the price, need a lower-carb high-protein drink: yeah, why not? :D	-1
Absolutely vile taste, after taste and experience. Bought vanilla, Chocolate and strawberry. Strawberry is the best but I would never buy again. When you open it up it fizzes out with some kind of unearthly carbonation,... from there the experience goes down rapidy> Nasty, nasty and did I say nasty! Buy Atkins instead!	-1
I will not buy strawberry again. Funny taste	-1
Tastes like vanilla root beer with a chalky aftertaste. Neither my fiance nor I enjoy this, but I have found other people do. I donated all of the rest of the pack to a homeless shelter in my area because they are way too heavy to deal with shipping back to Amazon. Turns out, they have been a huge hit there, so for some people this is a great product. Unfortunately those people don't include my family and I.	-1
No good	-1
Either my taste or the mix has changed. No recipe for using in the waffle iron. Find that I needed to add several more ingredients. Will not order again.	-1
Poor.	-1
Not that great.	-1
its been a while since i bought aunt jemima pancake mix - since that time, the company has drastically upped the 'sugar' content. the pancakes are WHY to SWEET! disqustingly sweet, actually.	-1
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY	-1
Just not good.  Drank one sip of one and threw the other 3 straight in the trash.	-1
I couldn't try them at all as the boxes were exploded. The order was made through Pantry and the two boxes arrived. They are massive boxes (something you can't tell unless you have a good grasp of proportions). I love this brand and this version of the pancakes. I just hated the experience from this vendor. I couldn't return it for 'some reason'.	-1
I like bisquick better.	-1
I normally like banana flavored protein shakes, but this artificial flavoring is just gross. WIth banana, I think you need a more viscous shake than this.	-1
Unfortunately for me, this shake is just too over the top sweet. There's no way I could drink an entire can of this without feeling a bit ill. I did manage to use it over the course of a couple of days by cutting the sweetness with coffee which worked pretty well either hot or cold. I don't know if I would buy this again. I'm going to reserve judgement until I try the other flavors. I hope there's at least one that I like because I have type 2 diabetes and I hate breakfast and this would be a great meal replacement that wouldn't make my blood glucose spike.  I have one more can of this to use and maybe it'll grow on me but I doubt it. I just don't have much of a sweet tooth so this seems pretty syrupy to me.  Bottom line: Just plain I give this 2 stars. If you drink it as a coffee additive and put it over ice (or hot but iced is better to me) then I would raise the stars to 3.	-1
Orbits gum has a terrible habit of melting after extended periods inside a bag or pocket. Not just a stick but the entire packet. Every pack that I've had this year particularly (not just from this purchase) has melted in my bag making it inedible. It doesn't ruin the bag or anything it just melts in the wrapper of the gum and makes the container look all wet. Wouldn't recommend.	-1
WIERD TASTE	-1
No fizz (flat as it could be). Very disappointed to be charged so much for a lackluster, tiny serving of beverage.	-1
contains palm oil.  a disputed unethical ingredient.  Also an allergen.  I'm sorry i bought this, i didn't eat it.	-1
did not care for	-1
Only that it has a sharp bitter taste that leaves makes me cringe.  That is the first thoughts that comes to mind after drinking part of the first box.  I bought three so I am not sure what to do now, may let them set in the frig and try again.	-1
At first sip, these were tasty ....... but then left a bad aftertaste in my mouth. Would not recommend.	-1
I bought Starburst for myself and friends not knowing that it has Gelatin in it which is not suitable for Vegetarians or Vegans.	-1
Not as good as I thought it would be. Very watered down flavor.	-1
Ok	-1
Cans were distorted during processing on the bottom of the can did not affect product for two out of three cans, but one was bulging. Had to throw that away. So, I found it odd all three cans damaged. Obviously they give you the roughed up cans. Not pleased.	-1
Cans somewhat bent up.	-1
What can I say? The all-American tuna, but poor Charlie is still swimming! However, this version, which is in oil, is not for me. (I accidentally ordered it, meaning to order the tuna in water.) And the first can that I opened was spoiled and smelled horrible. I threw all four cans away. Obviously, since most people buy the water version, this tuna in oil sits on the shelf for what must be ages before some numbskull like me orders it by mistake.	-1
Pure Sludge! I don't know what's happened to food over the past 20 yrs, but I do remember what "chunk" meant and this product had none. I had to empty the can in a fry pan and cook away the water to see the tuna. I'd never buy this again and shame on them for even creating this. I loved the price, but what's the point if the product only sells once. I did not have any dented can problems with any of the items I've purchased in the prime pantry.	-1
do not taste good at all.	-1
My kids didn't like them.  They are also pretty hard.	-1
disgusting. They melt in your mouth and taste terrible. I know it's for larger babies I guess, but eff this. Shiz is gross.	-1
Have zero nutritional content	-1
not a deal	-1
gross, these were not delicious at all.	-1
my son did not like or eat these. ended up being a waste of money. im not sure if it was a consistency thing or a lack of flavor	-1
Price to high for that small bottle I buy this all the time at different stores for the price I paid for this I could gone to my regular store and got the larger botttle for the same price I thought the size would be 70 to 100 oz O my God! I learned a lesson!	-1
Packaging says 4+ months but the opening where the food comes out is way too big for my 9 month to handle. It taste like normal peach baby food.	-1
The taste reminds me of the milk left in the cereal bowl after eating Lucky Charms, or some sugary cereal like that.  Not my cup of tea.  Drinkable, but definitely not that great-tasting, to me.  Watering it down or adding milk helps.	-1
Sometimes a rag, paper towel or whatever else you use to dust with just doesn't cut it. I decided to purchase these since a coupon was available on Amazon and see if it is any better than my normal dusting methods.  The result? I will say that this product is absolutely terrible.  Why, do you ask, that I say it is cheaply made? Well, the yellow handle isn't very strong. That was something that I could get over. The thing that bothered me the most is how delicate and EASILY you can destroy the actual duster part. It fell apart while even trying to put it together. I figured it might have just been that duster piece, so I tried another... It did no good. I felt like the duster part was leaving behind more fluffies than getting up any dust.  0/10, would not recommend.	-1
they don't hold much dust. it took 3 of them just to do one set of mini blinds and they are very expensive	-1
I can't get them to stay on they seem to be more of a burden than a help	-1
Did not go on the plastic handle easily.  One sided.	-1
Bottles were smaller than last order	-1
I do not believe that coca cola company had anything to do with the fact that the first drink taken went straight through me in a hurry!!  Based on the fact that I ordered much, a lot was inferior or seemed intentional, as strange as that may seem.	-1
A RIP-OFF!	-1
THEY USE A SWEETNER WITH A TERRIBLE AFTER TASTE AND USE WAY TOO MUCH. DON'T GET THIS, IT'S WASTED MONEY.	-1
Leaves spots.  Will not order again.	-1
I have used this product for a number of years.  I don't think it works as well since they changed the formula on it.  Now called "Complete"  since they added Dawn.  Used to be "All in One".  Leaves spots on the silverware and I have never had that happen until they added the Dawn to it.  Once in a while I have a problem with something not coming out clean.  I'm to a point I'm ready to try other brands when I run low on this Cascade product.	-1
Does not stick to the inside of the refrigerator very well at all	-1
Wouldn't stay on fridge, fell around	-1
just getting a box of the product and putting in the refrigerator works so much better for me	-1
didn't notice any change	-1
nuts were stale, had to throw them away	-1
These fall apart super easily	-1
not  very foamy	-1
Not what I wanted thought it was already use?  I have to wet then carefully rinse it will burn your eyes.  Going back to my AVEENO facial wipes very nice.	-1
I wouldn't by this again. Flavor is lacking.	-1
Smells like oatmeal	-1
These taste pretty bad. I won't be eating any of them.  I'm an adult who was trying to get back into taking my vitamins. The Yummi Bear Multivatamins and Vitafusion Calcium worked, but these are a no go.  I wouldn't recommend these for yourself or kids.	-1
Fluoride toothpaste. Appeared to be a natural non fluoride toothpaste!	-1
I like that it is a spray bottle and it is exactly what I was looking for in that sense. You can spray it on your back and all over plus you can hold it upside down or sideways to reach your back and that is beautiful about it BUT the smell is not good at all!! It smells like a combination of baby powder and sunscreen. I don't like the smell at all and I know that it os not supposed to smell like that. I do still use it because I love the moisture and the spray capabilities but I have to spray on body spray after it. Be careful if you spray it on while in bathroom and it gets on the floor because it is dangerously slippery.	-1
what a joke	-1
Poor quality. Used to be amazing, but now they just crumble and fall apart. I don't know what happened, but they're terrible now. I feel like I wasted my money on these. I used it to literally wipe my sink down and it fell apart. are you serious? to wipe my sink?! It was only dust and soap residue! They used to last through multiple cleaning jobs when I cleaned my grandmothers house. So disappointed.	-1
i don't get the hype	-1
I have always like Mr. Clean magic eraser products.  These seem to fall apart quickly because of the ridges so I prefer the smooth magic erasers since they are sturdier however they do clean.. The cheaper smooth ones hold up better so I think you can get better value for your money elsewhere.	-1
These were a big disappointment. Everyone hypes these up to be great and durable, but they aren't. I decided to clean my stove, a completely smooth surface, with a new one of those... After 2 minutes of wiping it began to tear apart! A chunk of the magic eraser broke off and on the side that I wasn't using for wiping began to crumble. I won't buy these again.	-1
They leave a residue and crumple up when trying to use them. I could go without.	-1
Crushed by a case of V8 drinks packed with it.	-1
HUGE price increase! This gets me really upset when there is a new product, I try it, I like it, then I go to order more in only a few weeks time and the PRICE almost doubled!!! that is not acceptable to me in any way, shape, or form. I will not buy again unless the overinflated price drops back to a reasonable level.	-1
Other than the boxes being left on my porch soaking wet when the delivery person knew it was supposed to rain & the boxes falling apart & all paper packaged products & cardboard packaged products inside being soaked as well this product is what is to be expected.	-1
The expiration was only three days away once delivered. The food product was dry and actually hard. We couldn't eat this and it wasn't allowed to be returned. This actually happened to MOST of the food items in my order. What a waste of money. It all went into the trash. So upset about this. I will never order food from online again.	-1
Tasted stale.	-1
Too sweet and gets super soggy. Yukkkk!!	-1
they picked a close up for the cover because inside you'll find tiny, thin, somewhat crusty pieces of cardboard with a slightly acid taste; no resemblance to graham crackers; dreadful, though the birds will eat it	-1
Like eating crunchy cardboard.	-1
These are really crunchy... some people might like it for it... but be warned the crumbs are everywhere!! I was snacking on this in my car and it made my car so messy.	-1
Very bland. Contrast in textures mediocre.	-1
I have been buying Always super pads since I got my period. I have an irregular flow and often need extra coverage. This is my first time buying pads with flex foam, though, and I'm very annoyed with the product. Although I appreciated the lighter feeling, the pads started disintegrated as I wore them. I would go to the bathroom to find the holes had torn open, leaving pieces of foam everywhere. When you're already dealing with a not-so-great annoyance, a faulty pad only adds frustration. I'm thoroughly disappointed.	-1
We get to a point out of our teens where we feel confident as woman to actually review a feminine product, lol. The idea of these at first I thought, ugh bad enough during that time ( When needed for those really bad Months,)  now I learned these are like a thin extra layer of panty liner, to make you feel fresh any day. Not an age thing , a woman thing. Issue, you guys, are the best for feminine products (Aside for the FACT  that prices MUST GET LOWER OR WOMAN SHOULD BE GIVEN A LARGE AMOUNT OF STOCK?  I FEEL AWEFUL IF A WOMAN CAN'T AFFORD THIS NECESSARY ITEM. WELL I AM REFERRING TO FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND THE OUTRAGEOUS PRICES!!!!!!!!!!!!) Any who, these liners, they move and bunch, compared to the generic ones, what gives?  Your other feminine products far surpassed generic? Some things HAVE to be name brand.  I guess I am the brave soul to actually review this type of of purchase for all woman kind , jaja, but hey we Ladies must help each other out.	-1
Complete waste of money, pure trash. They do not stay in place so they do no good whatsoever. Now I need to go spend more money to get normal liners.	-1
too small	-1
Over priced	-1
These things are so tiny and thin, I have to use three at a time. They don't stick very well either.	-1
A little too robust for my taste. The hint of chocolate is barely there.	-1
the tabs are easy to tear off. I like the originals better.	-1
Don't know what is going on with zip local but they are no longer providing quality bags. The break open very easily in the seams	-1
I guess I misunderstood what this item was. I thought it would be like really dark, bitter chocolate pieces. However, it is dried up Cacao bean pieces, that are shriveled looking and I couldn't even get past the smell. As I mentioned, I think this was my misunderstanding, but I wanted to save others from possibly making the same mistake. You will not like these if you are looking for chocolate or anything that resembles chocolate. I ended up giving them away and have never heard whether they used it or not.	-1
No fault of the company I'm sure. I've never tried this before, so I didn't know what to expect. It was very bitter and tasted like it was soaked in alcohol. I would imagine that this is an acquired taste. I'm not willing to try and acquire it. For those who have tried this type of product and do like it this company has an amazing reputation for quality. I've purchased many other items and was happy with all of them until now. Don't let my bad review scare you away, if this is something you enjoy.	-1
This batch I got were very old..and not good like most..They had tiny mold speckles.	-1
This stuff tastes nasty.  I used it once and threw it out.	-1
I'm also allergic to nuts. Didn't know these had nuts in them. Had to give them to my sisters	-1
More than 2x the amount of sugars of even sweetened bowl of oatmeal.  19 grams  I expected more from these but should have not trusted Quaker to provide a healthy oatmeal bar.  Not the type of thing you want to be feeding your children.  They tasted like a candy bar anyway nothing like oatmeal.	-1
Bought this mistaking it for the original "Maple and brown sugar" oatmeal from Quaker. What a mistake. This tastes and smells quite bad, like your favorite movie with all characters replaced by robots. The smell alone is almost enough to make me puke. Filled with added whey protein, maltodextrin, guar gum, and artificial flavors and sweeteners -- including acesulfame! Eww...	-1
My children hate the taste of these.	-1
I thought I was drinking acid when I tried to drink a cup of coffee with just one teaspoon of this sugar in it.  It was so bad that I am sure there is nothing worse.  And now I have a bag of crappy sugar open and I can't return it, guess this one will meet the trash can, it is THAT bad.  Ugh!	-1
I am sure there is nothing wrong with the product itself but it simply did not meet my expectations.  I expected coconut sugar to have at least a slight taste of coconut and at least a slight sweetness of sugar.  Well, I was wrong on both accounts.  This product has zero sweetness and zero coconut flavor.  It's dark brown in color.  In my opinion, it looks, smells, and taste like very finely ground bitter graham cracker crumbs.  Again, this product is new to me so I assume a more experienced chef would know to expect this.  However, if you are expecting something more like coconut infused sugar, this is not the product for you.	-1
I am very meticulous about my diabetes management and care.  I take oral medications, and while my numbers aren't perfect, I do run an A1C of 6.1 (give or take .1 - .3).  I've heard the so-called benefits of Coconut Sugar, and have been focusing on low-glycemic meals for some time, so giving Coconut Palm Sugar a whirl seemed like a no-brainer to me.  I ordered a package set up a very informal test to gauge its efficacy, and now am sitting down to write my review.  So?  First: My Test Construct  To test this product, and compare it to other products, I used the following: 1. For food, I had 1 cup of plain cooked steel-cut oatmeal 2. For beverages I used 16 oz of home-brewed unsweetned ice tea  I ran each test on different days (e.g. Day 1 - Coconut Sugar in Oatmeal; Day 2 Coconut Sugar in Ice Tea; Day 3 Equal in Oatmeal, and so forth) and tried the tests at the same time of day.  Observations:  A. Flavor - I found a slight flavor profile shift and an unappetizing colorization (to the yellowish-brown spectrum). This was the first negative for me.  B. Sweetness - in the oatmeal test, I used 1 tsp of the product (the recommended serving size) in my oatmeal   - I could discern no appreciable sweetening of the oatmeal   - Glycemic Load - I found no real significant difference between this product, Equal, or plain oatmeal (unsweetened) on my pre- and post- blood sugar levels   Test:  I tested my blood sugar prior to consuming, then 30 minutes after consuming, then 1 hour after consuming.   (NOTE: Comparison to brown sugar:  I detected a hint of sweetness, but saw 30 point spike in my blood sugar at 30-minutes).  In Beverages:   The Test:  Again to test this, I used 1 16oz glass of Ice Tea with no additional ingredients (just loose leaf black tea I brew)   The Product:  I added 2 tsp of the Coconut Sugar (2x the suggested serving amount) to my ice tea   Results:  Much the same as above.  I found a slight color shift to brown, and no appreciable sweetening effect of the tea (it tasted no sweeter than just plain ice tea, minus the flavor profile shift of the Coconut Sugar).    Comparison:  My comparison was (same as above) to check my blood sugar immediately prior to consuming and then 30 minutes after consuming and again 1 hour after consuming.  I found my blood sugar spiked slightly (15 points) with the Coconut Sugar as opposed to plain ice tea or ice tea (sweetened with 1 packet of equal (1g of weight).    I did not test with sugar at this time, as I felt my results between the oatmeal test and Ice Tea test already indicated a sufficient trend.  C.  Nutritional Value - The claim is the low glycemic and minerals and nutrients.  According to the package's Nutritional information panel, the highest mineral concentration is Potassium (36 mg) followed by Sodium (5 mg) and rounding off the bottom:  Total Carbohydrate (4g) and Sugars (4g).   (NOTE: To Compare, 1 average sized banana contains approximately 422mg of Potassium (13% of the DRA for an adult).  CONCLUSION:  For me, I find no significant value in using this product in neither management of glycemic tolerance nor sweetening of food and beverage.  While an argument can be made for Nutritional benefit, this benefit, in my opinion, is negligible.  Basically, I find this product to be a non-functional "sweetener" with an unappetizing food colorization and slight flavor profile shift that provided no discernible sweetness. As to nutritional value, I find this product worst of all) near-negligible nutritional value.  I don't find it a better option than just a balanced, nutritious diet.  I don't find it has significant benefit to diabetes management, and I STRONGLY URGE any diabetic to discuss the concerns of relying on this product to aid in diabetes care management with a licensed professional nutritionist/endocrinologist.  The only benefit I did find, is it was less taxing on my insulin/blood sugar levels than equal amounts of refined sugar.  In closing, these results are only self-observed.  However, the results did show me that, for me anyway, the keys to proper weight control/diabetes management is sensibility and moderation.	-1
Ok, the dinosaur thing? Great gimmick! Each oatmeal packet has Dinosaur trivia, or a dinosaur joke, or games! Kids love that sort of thing! Also, the little eggs that turn into dinosaurs in hot water? Another thing kids love! However, I am not a kid...Just a kid at heart! I'm interested in taste, and that's where this is severely lacking! The oatmeal it's self is very bland, and nearly flavorless! The dinosaurs are a bit hard, and i'm sorry..hard bits in my oatmeal is not something I enjoy. The point of oatmeal is that it's warm, gooey and soft!  Overall, not worth my money.	-1
Product worked well, but the smell was too much.  I couldn't use it.	-1
This keeps me from stinking and sweating, but I feel like it leaves a weird residue that is really hard to wash off in the shower.  It kind of creeps me out.	-1
doesn't work for me at all	-1
The expiration was only three days away once delivered. The food product was dry and actually hard. We couldn't eat this and it wasn't allowed to be returned. This actually happened to MOST of the food items in my order. What a waste of money. It all went into the trash. So upset about this. I will never order food from online again.	-1
Not so good	-1
Tasted stale	-1
I react as if I have the flu if I take this product, so I have stopped after two uses.	-1
Moderate.. I understand they aren't going to be amazing and rather healthy, however, these were very blah.... Minimal berry flavor	-1
Not much flavor and super dry.  I was hoping for more of a graham cracker flavor but it is more like wheat paste flavor not sweet at all.  The jam in the center is dry and does not help with graham sides so it sucks the moisture out of your mouth.  On the bright side they are less calories than other bars and have some tiny flavor.	-1
Not for me, hate the taste of buckwheat and it comes through.	-1
The graham encasing part is rather dry with a mealy mouth feel and little flavor.  If it wasn't called "Graham" in the name I'd have never thought it was a graham cracker concoction as there is very little graham cracker flavor.  It's a typical "healthy" multi-grain product flavor.  Almost like eating cardboard with a bit of flavor.  This is somewhat offset by a nice blackberry filling but it's not enough to save the outer shell and make these a repeat purchase.	-1
I'm probably comparing my expectation too much to the nutrigrain cereal bar on the market. These just didn't wow me and had a "mealy" texture I didn't enjoy. I also didn't get any clear and obvious berry flavor. Love the idea from a nutrition perspective but I won't be buying these again.	-1
Yuck!	-1
Not what I expected. Menthol smell is overwhelming.	-1
DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE ECZEMA.  While as a lotion it works good the problem is that the chemicals used in this lotion are not high quality.  I have eczema reactions that are triggered through this lotion and I hate it.  My feet flare up and I'm still itchy the following day.	-1
tests on animals :( i didn't know that	-1

I am a senior but have baby fine hair so thought I would give this Suave Kids 3 in 1 Shampoo a try. Regular conditioner weights it down so much. The first thing I noticed was while rinsing my hair it was so massively tangled I wasn't able to run my fingers through it as usual to get the shampoo out. My hair was all balled up. I rinsed as best as I could. Looking back I should have re-shampooed with my regular shampoo and used my conditioner but I didn't. I have NEVER had so much trouble combing out my wet hair. It was unbelievably tangled. After drying it, it was so full of electricity it was just standing up in the air and my hair is below shoulder length. This is the worst shampoo I have ever used and I don't believe there is ANY conditioner in it. I guess some folks like it but I surely do not recommend it.	-1
If you want to decrease the products you sell keep the one for sensitive skin and if you need to raise the price go ahead.	-1
Doesn't work on getting rid of my black heads but it does clean my face...	-1

Those micro-beads are pretty bad for the environment	-1
They got rid of the sensitive skin one and it never works good for people like with very sensitive skin.  St Ives lost plenty of customers, I am sure.	-1

The smell is not one that I like.  I left it at work in case I need it.  It works but the smell is stopping it from being my go-to Moisturizer.	-1
they are so thick in the private area you cant move. very uncomfortable	-1
I purchased these TENA underwear for my grandmother (who is assisting me in writing this review.) At 90 she doesn't get around as easily as she use to.  She began to wear Depends for "just in case" she was out somewhere and unfamiliar with where the bathrooms were. She really didn't care for how bulky the Depend brand was. So Tena was recommended.  She found them to be bulky as well and many of the legs were defective and glued shut. Making.them a waste of money in her opinion. They are not the product for her and she wouldn't recommend them to others.	-1
the lotion is so thick it will not pump from the bottle, it barely pours in my hand when the pump is out of the bottle and i am holding the bottle upside down and tapping the bottle. I like the product but, it needs a different dispersing method.,	-1
Box opened	-1
Yikes.  Too sweet.  I didn't want to waste them so I threw them in a cake when I did not have any sugar.  It tasted like an ez-bake oven cake.  Will not be repurchasing, and yes you can dehydrate and rehydrate real strawberries.  None here.	-1
All Bran Cereal, Original, 18.3-Ounce (519g) Boxes (Pack of 5), by All-Bran. This Kellogg's All-Bran cereal is chewy, but it does not stand up to milk for very long before becoming soggy. It is time consuming to eat.  It is boring, without much taste, only a little better than eating brown corrugated cardboard.  I mixed it with other cereals like Rice Krispies and Special K to make it more interesting. A normal cereal serving size is 1 cup.  This cereal has a serving size listed as  cup, as one cup of this cereal might be more than you want to deal with.  Sorry, Kellogg's, there just isn't much nice to be said for this cereal. Eat a banana for your Potassium instead.  Kellogg's is playing with the numbers, as a normal one cup serving would yield a high calorie rating of 160mg, a high sodium rating of 160mg, a very high Carbohydrate rating of 46g, and a very high Potassium rating of 700mg.  Two stars. The Nutrition Facts and Ingredients, as listed on the box:  Nutrition Facts: Serving Size   cup (31g), Servings per Container  About 17.

I found that this actually caused discomfort to my eyes if I kept it on for 15 minutes.	-1
It started eating at my gums!!!!!!! BAD product! I've never had that happen before! It's in the trash now!	-1
Not good value for the money.	-1
Strong, overpowering scent.  Surfaces take forever to dry.  I won't buy this again.	-1
what a disappointment. I use wet wipes for feminine hygiene and this was the first time to try these. I know not to buy their toilet tissue, because a papercut in sensitive spot isn't something you willingly let happen twice. But; I thought maybe this would be a better, softer product and well; they are soft. so soft they come apart in your fingers. Like; disintegrating on contact. They are a lot smaller than Huggies or Pampers brands too. I won't be buying these again.	-1
Three people in our family have had pneumonia since September. We're going a bit nuts about it because it keeps coming back. I bought these in an effort to do a major cleaning, then use one or two of these in every room daily to wipe down handles and surfaces.  I put them everywhere, and also bought the Window wipes that they make as well.  Twice a day I wipe sinks and counters and toilet handles and seats (last).  In the kitchen I am using them constantly.  Thing is, they irritate my hands (little blisters around my fingers.  There aren't that many in a pack, or else they are very small, they just don't seem to last when you need two or three at a time.  They smell great, but the top is hard to shut so I can see them drying out fast and being ruined if they get bumped (the lids pop up).  And we're still sick.	-1
i prefer another brands	-1
Very high price for such little butt wipes. They are soft enough but the wipes are just too small. I won't purchase these again; I can get way more product for way less.	-1
Leaves streaks	-1
did not seem to work at all, either on my granite or my stainless steel.....spots still visible..	-1
Didn't notice this did anything special. Even seemed to leave a slight film on things. Disappointed.	-1
Dose not work as well as what I had hoped.  Leaves residue on my stainless appliances.  Honestly my regular kitchen cleaner or even soap and water does just as good of job.	-1
Came as liquid when my prior jar of different mfg was solid.  All previous coconut oil I have purchased remained solid year round. I don't know whether this is good or bad, or whether it indicates the product contains a different type of oil. I will contact manufacturer when I have time and will modify this review if the answer is favorable.	-1
I tried cooking with this because i have heard how good it is for you, however i couldn't eat my cooked meal because it was so oily tasting, i just couldn't bring myself to eat it. I know it is healthy but i don't know how people do it.	-1
I can't use this at all.  My skin breaks out in a rash....	-1
I ordered two of these.  One of them was opened and it spilled out all over other items in my box.  It was a big mess.	-1
It leaked into and thru the box.  Everything was fine but needed to wipe other products off and the Downy bottle.:(	-1
Smell bad... to purfumey	-1
Waste of time	-1
basically, this is a waste of money for me. It didn't do anything, and they don't dissolve well either. Downy 'regular' is a better bet; it woks even once the product goes down 1/2 way, fill with water and it will still work perfectly::))!!	-1
I love this stuff but I'm extremely allergic to this scent! I used a towel washed after the 1st use and after a few minutes my head was burning like a chemical burn. My scalp has remained bright red, painful and breaking out in blisters along with swelling for 5 days now. Be careful!	-1
I did not see it function or maintain the fresh scent. Very disappointed sadly I did  not expect Downy makers making this product.	-1
The smell was overwhelming and like bad perfume. Fabric softener works best.	-1
OK	-1
I have found so many pieces of plastic (the pod) stuck to items that I have washed. It looks like a dried on snot ball, I'll be going back to making my own!	-1
Prefer the original.	-1
This bar is over-rated.	-1
THIS IS NOT DAIRY FREE even though it says so in the item description. Be careful.	-1
Stale.	-1
I like the bars, but this one is not as tasty as I thought.	-1
Lacking Flavor.  One of my favorite flavor combinations is dark choc and sea salt, however these bars fall short. I love that they are health options, but I wish they tasted a little better. I don't know if the box I received was fresh, but the bars were like biting on rocks, they were sooooo hard.  I don't think I will be purchasing again.	-1
I was hoping for a full bodied aroma and flavor profile. This wasn't it. It did however smell nice.	-1
I hate the taste of this energy drink, horrible aftertaste compared to other brands.	-1
Do not like this flavor	-1
Get the cherry instead. These tasted pretty bad.	-1
I LOVE this flavor of Kind Bars.  I bought two boxes of these here on Prime Pantry and both of the boxes were rancid.  You could smell and taste that the nuts had gone rancid.  All well within the expiration date also.  I bought some singly in the local store with a similar expiration date and they were fine.  Waste of money.	-1
I DID NOT GET IT YET BUT, IF IT IS THE SAME!!! NO MORE KIND BARS FOR ME. GREEN MOLDED DOES DO NOTHING BUT, MAKE ME SICK, AND FULL OF SEA SALT SOME BARS.  MICKEY	-1
This is very sweet.  I think it must have stevia leaves in it.  If you don't like extra sweet things, you may not like this.	-1
A little flat.  I like my sparkling water to be full of sparkles.  Unfortunately, stored in a plastic bottle, osmosis takes over.  If you order this, ask for a glass bottle!	-1
I bought these and they were so near the expectation date that there was no fizz. Where are my bubbles!!!	-1
good	-1
You can definitely taste the sugar free in this. I only use a very little bit every now and then just to get my money's worth but the flavor is just so bitter and off you can never use too much without messing up whatever you're trying to make. I would never ever buy this without the sugar again.	-1
Purchased these as the description states regular. It's not. The length is almost from bellybutton to way high in the rear. They measure 11 1/2" long. I am not certain if the manufacturer decided length by absorption level, but the level 5 is 2 1/2" longer than the level 4. Unfortunately, as we age many of us need a little help in case of the unexpected sneeze. I usually get the level 4, but the Pantry was out. So beware, level 5 is a full 2 1/2" longer than the level 4. It is not a regular length as it is mentioned on the package. I have figured out a way to cut off the extra and fold over. It's not worth the aggregation sending back. So, beware, this is not regular length.	-1
Could've been worse...	-1
Not worth the cost.	-1
This has a peppery after taste. I will use it up since I bought it but will not be purchasing again.	-1
Perhaps I just got a bad one, but when I opened this I noticed a few greenish noodles....I wrongfully assumed it was just a mix of colored pasta.  After a few bites I tasted one of the off-colored ones and realized I had been eating something that had spoiled.  I bought two of these so I will see if the other one is spoiled as well...I'll update when I do.... Otherwise these could be pretty good for a quick and easy meal...	-1
"Different" from the usual salty baked snacks.  More of a 'party conversation piece' than a real snack for TV viewing all evening.  Personal flavor preferences vary, but the broccoli isn't overwhelming.  My wife liked them.	-1
I enjoy the chocolate. This one though... is too sweet. Tastes like a raw birthday cake. Will buy the chocolate again, but will never buy the vanilla. ick.	-1
Berry not so yummy as the other flavors.	-1
TINY, TINY, TINY!  This ad is VERY deceptive.  The 'tin' fits in your hand.  hardly any olive oil.  Do not buy.	-1
It washes the washing machine no better than using soap and bleach. I don't know what I expected	-1
I use Aveeno lotions almost exclusively, so I thought I'd try this new product.  It doesn't come unscented which I prefer to buy, and I don't like this scent.  I thought the combo lotion/oil would be more moisturizing, but my skin feels dryer and the moisture doesn't stick with you like the regular lotion does.  I do not recommend this Aveeno product and wish they hadn't taken the regular, unscented lotion off the market.	-1
One reviewer was right: it smells too much. Not what I want on my face.	-1
dove tests on animals :(	-1
Left hair looking and feeling kinda greasy after as little as 6 hours.  H&S is still the way to go.	-1
I have a really sensitive scalp so I'm wary of straying from my norm, but I thought I'd give this a try.  Unfortunately, it made my scalp breakout like most of the others I've tried.  I can't really blame Dove, but if you have an easily agitated head/hairline, I would stay away.	-1
Runny and stinks!	-1
Product looks outdated. The color of this bodywash looks dull and blackish tone to it!!! I have used this one before and surely the color looks odd enough. Not willing to use it!!	-1
The smell is awful.	-1
It is not creamy, and I didn't like the smell.	-1
Try again, last attempt review vaporized. What IS IT about this lotion that feels like you coated your skin in plastic and looks that way also? Have the heavy, greasy cream does not do that but is not hand cream. I will stay with Excipal brand strong suggestion by dermatologist.  TYVM. Amazon has Excipal, btw.	-1
Too thick with a plastic like feel to it. Stopped using in a week.	-1
I have naturally wavy thin fine hair. It's hard to deal with. I read all the positive reviews and bought this. I now barely have any wave in my hair and it's stringy. I like my waves. I don't like the ragdoll look.	-1
My husband said it felt and smelled weird. Like the smell of plastic. Said left him oily too.	-1
super perfumey, unbearably so. Unbearably awful. I'll choose other scents from Suave. I love their products but this one is just horrid.	-1
It's ok, nothing special doesn't seem to work as well as other shampoos I use.  Would not buy again.	-1
It is really cold and does not feel nice on skin.	-1
To determine if a product you use contains microbeads, look on the ingredient list for polyethylene or polypropylene. Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), L'Oreal, Procter & Gamble (PG) and Unilever (UL) all have said they'll phase out microbeads. Illinois last year became the first state to ban microbeads. New Jersey followed suit. Now New York, California and Colorado are considering similar bans, and many more states are expected to join. To see why Illinois was the first state, read about the damage, Why Those Tiny Microbeads In Soap May Pose Problem For Great Lakes... Neutrogena's ingredients have always been the worst but they have got away with slick marketing.	-1
I liked it at first but soon it made my hair very flaky.  Needed a good clarifying shampoo to get out the buildup.	-1
This brand is good...this product is not. It may have some sort of positive traits, but the smell is not lavender- it's soapy and artificial smelling. I was expecting a real, lavender smell, but this is anything but.  Skip this product and look for another one.  Perhaps I got bad batch?	-1
Too much fragrance	-1
When you first use these they are moist, I push the package down tightly to keep the air out but it doesnt work at all.  Still very dry .  Won't buy again!	-1
Just okay. Wasn't really thorough. I washed my face with this one night, especially getting my mascara and eye makeup off, rinsed, and went to bed. Woke up with raccoon eyes. So it didn't get all the mascara off.  What else did it miss?  Maybe it's just a surface clean and leaves icky stuff under the surface?  I know it's a convenience measure rather than a real facial, but I likely will only use these camping or on nights I'm too tired to move.  I can't risk my skin remaining dirty when I think it's clean	-1
I am not sure.  First time user.  Face felt a little sticky.	-1
good shampoo but I wanted a better restorative product with good essence	-1
Weighs down hair.	-1
I did not see any difference in my hair at all.	-1
This is an OK product for lightly conditioning the hair, but I expected something more hydrating from a mask. I did not expect a mask to repair the damage in my hair, but I expected more smoothness after applying this. My hair is definitely not overly processed (I never died my hair). This mask just makes my hair not tangle, leaving it barely hydrated.  The tub was not sealed when I received this.	-1
feels thick and clumpy and doesn'tdo anything better for my hair	-1
They are not Puffs plus Lotion..they are some unknown brand	-1
dont like cubes	-1
Puffs Plus has been in my house for more years or decades than I can count. Now, these tissues (besides being smaller) are a mere skeleton of the Good Ole Puffs. They are super and non absorbent. I am certain all other tissue brands shrunk, but now I have to try some thing different.  I am very disappointed.	-1
I have thick curly hair and this conditioner doesn't really do anything for it, it doesn't moisturize it and I have to use a second conditioner because this one doesn't really help get rid of tangles either.	-1
To be fair - I can't really test this product long enough to tell if it has a volumizing effect - which so far it doesn't - but again, can't test it any longer because this smells DISGUSTING.  Beware.  I love smelly soaps and shampoos, and it's very rare I find one I don't care for.  This has neither a floral, fruity, or clean soapy smell - it's smells like some cloying sweet candy gone wrong, and the smell is VERY strong - it ALMOST smells like something sugary that has been rotting away outside in the heat for a week.  I am not joking.  Haven't looked at other reviews to see if others agree - but believe me - this shampoo is just not worth it.  There are so many better smelling products out there.  I realize smell is not the most important aspect of a shampoo - but you know, one that makes you want to get sick in the shower is probably not worth your time.  ***ETA - Just in case anyone is wondering what kind of nut I am - as far as other L'Oreal product go, I am absolute in LOVE with the smell of every other L'Oreal product I have ever tried, from their hair care to their facial products, etc.  It's not as though I don't like the general "scent" I associate with L'Oreal.  This product smells NOTHING LIKE any of the other products the company makes.  Smells like something you might buy 12 years expired.  No joke.	-1
This Shampoo/Conditioner combination has made my hair very strawlike and so that I cannot comb it when I get out of the shower. Since I have EXTREMELY long hair this is a major issue for me. Also, since I pay upwards of $85 to have my hair done, I don't want to ruin my color with products that destroy my hair at home. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with these products. I'll have to stick with my Pantene.	-1
How is this advance? My GBA, Gameboy Advance, was advance. This is not cool.	-1
Who on earth thought to fold moist wipes to dispense like tissues? In order to pull out the wet wipe you actually need you also have to pull out most of the next wet wipe you don't need. Bought these almost a year ago and they were relegated to a low-use environment due to pure annoyance of use. The box is nice but does not keep the unneeded pulled out wipe from drying out very quickly, the pulled out wipe has to be stuffed back into the baggie which needs to be sealed.	-1
While the quality of the wipes are fine the container they arrive in is hard to open and close for children. I needed these for my kids and they weren't able to use them beacause they weren't easily accesible. (Yes they needed to stay in a container).	-1
The towelettes dry out inside the carton very fast. The seal on it was tight. I am thinking there was some kind of problem with the seal however. They smelled nice and were fairly thick. I wonn't purchase them again. I am going back to my old brand.	-1
The reason I chose this answer was not because of the product in the container, but because in my opinion the container itself is not appropriate for shampoo. Unfortunately the bottle flipped off during shipment and just about destroyed everything that was shipped with it. If this bottle were to fall from the little shelf that I keep my shampoo and conditioners on, there is no doubt in my mind that it would flip open from the fall and pour out on the shower floor (my opinion). The small flip open cap that are usually found on bottles of shampoo including the Loreal Absolute Repair Cellular with Lactic Acid has such a cap, and has been knocked on the floor without spillage. Obviously I was very upset about  your shampoo messing up my shipment by emptying in the box. This was a first, I wouldn't even suggest Loreal put tape on this bottle cap because the top is to big. I'm not sure the liquid would stay in the bottle anyway, because you do not have the choice of standing it on either end, only on the top. It also would be cumbersome to deal with in the shower. Sorry you lost me on this one. I probably will send all three Loreal Products back.	-1
I didn't realize it, but this is just another conditioner.  I didn't see any volumizing effect at all.  I bought it along with the "densifying gelee," and I wish I had stuck with just the latter.  Now I have a huge bottle of conditioner that does the same thing as all my other huge bottles of conditioner.	-1
Like the product except I Did not receive amount in the description and returned	-1
The longer I use this shampoo/conditioner combination the dryer my hair becomes. It literally turns my hair into a straw like feeling while in the shower and makes it nearly impossible to comb when I get out. Since I have extremely LONG hair this is an issue for me. I will cease using this shampoo/conditioner after today and after having used it for a week in order to save my hair. VERY DISAPPOINTED.	-1
Wasn't what I expected.	-1
Very thin.  Not like Poise Max.  I won't be buying these again.	-1
THESE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS 'MAXIMUM' protection in anyway- they would only work if used in combination with another product- I WORE THESE TO A DOCTOR'S VISIT AND HAD TO GET A PRODUCT THAT WAS MORE APPRORIATE from the receptionist who saw me looking like a 'drowning duckling' as I ran into the bathroom repeatedly trying to find a product that would conceal my wet pants.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I WOULD NEVER GO OUT USING THIS, UNLESS I HAD HAD A SURGICAL PROCEDURE THAT STOPPED INCONTINENCE.  BULKY PADS ARE 'ARKWARD' BUT THEY WORK AND GIVE MAXIMUM PROTECTION.  I WANT A REFUND- HOPEFULLY you make underwear that holds thicker and 'wet proof' pads from different companies in a wide array of sizes- THIN IS NOT ENOUGH WHEN ABSORBENCE IS THE PRIMARY NEED.	-1
very thin.	-1
i thought these were HAND Towels, its a package of napkins! The same kind in restuarants and certainly not worth the price! Won't buy agin, fool me once....	-1
My children like this flavor, but I found it too strong. I really like cream soda so I tried to find a way to like this. I even halved it with cola to try to make a vanilla coke...no dice. It's just too strong. I also tried halving it with orange to make a dreamcicle...didn't work, either.	-1
In all fairness, I have never gotten relief from Tylenol. I figured I would give it another shot after 20 or so years (since I was having an especially bad allergy/sinus season this year) but...no dice. (and no relief). Sorry, still not for me.	-1
I am not a big fan of using Neosporin, to be honest. I used it in two areas: on my face and lower knee cap. When I used it on my face, I ended up breaking out. Around my knee cap area, I had a minor burn, which led to an infection after I applied Neosporin on. I had to go to urgent care, and turns out that the white petroleum in Neosporin is made up of 98% of the inactive ingredient. My doctor said I should buy USP petroleum jelly or beeswax, next time. The only thing I use Neosporin on is paper cuts and other very teeny weenie scrapes.	-1
I was surprised that my hair seemed to be less shiny and even a little dull after using this shampoo. It cleaned my hair well, hence the three stars but didn't do anything to enhance my dark hair.  My hair is very fine so maybe that has something to do with it.	-1
Coffee addict, so bought 2 of these.  Best price for coffee I have found on Amazon.  Um...there is clearly a reason.  This is the WORST & most bitter tasting coffee I have ever had.  Be warned....	-1
I do like this coffee. HOWEVER, I find it very interesting that this product is listed as "currently unavailable" but the same item can be purchased not at my purchase price of $7.99 but for the mere sum of $17.22. An amazing bargain, don't you think?  Update: Apparently this item is now available at the fantastic price of $14.85 !!	-1
This would make a Goat Puke.	-1
Not a fan of this coffee. My husband didn't like it at all. It plugs up my Cuisinart coffee maker. It has a weird taste to it so we mixed it with another brand. Will not be buying this again.	-1
This coffee tastes like what I imagine wet socks do. It didn't matter how much I varied the grounds or water.	-1
gevvalia is a very good coffee been buyer off and on	-1
Too much sugar!	-1
Too much trouble for a sip or two.	-1
My first purchase of these Whole Wheat Fig bars were from a local market and I loved them.  They are similar to Fig Newtons but I liked their whole wheat dough flavor better.  My next order was from Amazon and I decided to try two varieties (Whole Wheat Fig Bars and  Whole Wheat Peach Apricot)  and the Fig Bars appeared to be more dry and less flavorful (Apricot bars were fine). I am disappointed in inconsistency of the product.  I don't think I will buying them again.  Ali Julia review	-1
I do not care for these at all. to dry and hard for me. my husband and child like them though. So maybe It is just me. But I won't buy again .	-1
They taste horrible	-1
Milk curdled in the coffee	-1
I just didn't like the flavor nor the texture.. nor even the looks. Kind of like a strange color browning but with fiber.. just not what I expected.	-1
Tasted very wheaty. Not a fan	-1
Wasn't impressed with this product. I used it with juice, and it tasted pretty bad. Maybe mire juice, not for sure though.	-1
These seemed like a good idea, but they taste like artificial sweetener (which I hate)	-1
After rinsing, cooking and rinsing again they have a very strange texture and odor.	-1
Products just as described, exactly what I wanted.	-1
Almost all were bad and some under ripe. Maybe a single handful or less were ok	-1
Just not good.  Chewy, rubbery, no taste, slight smell.  Better off just using all wheat pasta.	-1
for the size of the bag the price was too much	-1
Kinda slimy?	-1
The packaging doesn't keep these nuts fresh for very long.  I've switched to another brand.	-1
Could only eat a small amount of the bag	-1
Not what I expected. Pictures did not show how the product really was. I followed the instructions for cooking and tried it with some chicken. The texture feels like plastic, it does not have any taste. I had to throw the whole box in the garbage. Personally I don't like it and would have liked to have seen in pictures how this item really was inside the packet, because I would not have bought this.	-1
has no taste and the texture is like melted plastic.	-1
Not sold. I'd recommend squash spaghetti instead if you don't want pasta.	-1
Way too much work rinsing and letting set and cooking.	-1
I luv Pistachio, but the bag I received must have been at the bottom .. not good at all	-1
Zero Carbs,  Zero Calories, Zero Fiber and Zero Taste,  Rice and Noodles both even if you follow the cooking direction you get that fish market smell.  The bag says it will absorbed the taste of what ever you add them to.  I can see where people could like these as they have no nutritional value what so ever, but I choose to eat things that are good for my body's needs and well being.  You can eat plenty food  that feed your bodies need and manage your Carbs an Calories with out eating white tasteless filler.  Also a serving size is 3oz cooked.  2oz cooked whole wheat pasta is just 70 Calories and 12 Carbs and has so much more taste with things like fiber which is good for you.  I'll skip this, but as you can see lots of people like it a lot.	-1
They tasted good, but were over salted in my opinion. I ate about a third of a bag, and woke up about 3 hours later with a massive headache and stomach virus. Once I got my thoughts back together the next day, I went online to see if there was a recall on the bag I received. There wasn't, but I trashed the remainder regardless. I would be scared to purchase these again, as I believe they did a number on me.	-1
Not worth the price and lacks quality.	-1
Not very fresh.  Nuts were not crisp. Damp and squishy, not crisp.	-1
Too expensive bag eaten in one day.	-1
Did not like this product. I have been reducing gluten and thought these would be the answer to pasta and rice.  The texture is awful with no taste no matter what is added.	-1
What a waste of time. What it takes to make these takes longer than if you simply cook reg rice or pasta. There's no use for these to exist.	-1
I just don't get this product. The texture is nothing like pasta or rice and when I opened a package it had an odd smell, which did not go away even after I rinsed it in in water as directed. It tastes awful and the texture is mushy. I do not recommend this at all. Sorry.....	-1
just not our tase-we tried them as something new. easy to use-	-1
Did not like these at all--	-1
Also stale for the cost is upsetting	-1
I've had lots of Pistachios, but never as hard as these ones. Thought I was gonna break my teeth on most of them. Other then that, they taste ok. Nothing special..	-1
I bought this large box of bats and am so dissapponted. They must be old or something. Super greasy with oils and taste not as fresh. Dissatisfied customer. I love Lara bars but the consistency of this one is gross. I've purchased the same one from the grocery store in town and not had a problem.	-1
do not like it because it taste very not good, i suggest you guys buy the tablet version.	-1
Tasty and natural, but with a really bad nutrition profile in terms of sugar and fat compared to others. I'm going back to Kashi bars which have about 1/3 the sugar and fat compared to these.	-1
White mulberries	-1
Didn't care for these.  They reminded me of weird raisins.	-1
I love Pumpkin Spice but didn't much care for this. It was a lot of spice and very little pumpkin or coffee flavor. It was palpable when I added a shot of espresso to it.	-1
Mr Yuck would not approve	-1
high hopes for this but tasted spoiled	-1
disgusting..NO HAZELNUT FLAVOR AT ALLl....tastes like...cinnamon and? who knows what... waste of $7.99..not to mention $5.99 shipping rip off from Amazon Prime Pantry not the free shipping offerec. WHAT IT SAYS ON THIS CAN IS NOT WHAT IS INSIDE..AND NO ONE WILL MAKE IT RIGHT	-1
It'a really not that okay. The flavoring is REALLY strong...too strong. Way way too strong.	-1
Don't try to use this salt in a shaker; it has the consistency of damp sand. Very disappointing at a very steep price!	-1
1.12 per ounce for salt? anyone check the kosher salt shown next to it for... 0.04 per ounce? you tell me you can taste that 1.08 difference per ounce and you win	-1
Used a Ninja Coffee Bar and a moka pot to make espresso out of this. Didnt like the taste of it. It didn't have the boldness of espresso nor the aroma.	-1
The coffee tasted good, but at least 1/4th of the pods clogged up my Keurig.  Will not buy again for that reason.	-1
These are pretty weak tasting, but my parents like them as they like more watered down, mild coffee.	-1
Not good flavor	-1
This basically lives up to hippy food stereotypes...it is bland and has a weird texture.  I'm sure there's a bunch of people out there that are like "once you get used to it you'll love it!"...no.  If I can't get past having no taste, then I'm not going to get used to it.  It is the type of snack my boyfriend refers to as "bird food".	-1
i didn't care for the mix, some flavors were really off for me	-1
MOST of the variety was tea...and most of the was flavored with lemon, which I do not like.  I expected more coffee.	-1
Terrible coffee. Very weak and the flavor is not that great. I've had to adjust the amount of water to much less and it still doesn't taste very good. Waste of money.	-1
Nope.  Lots of decaf and weird flavors I was not expecting.	-1
Not as versatile as I would like. I tried it in hot tea and it overcame, rather than enhanced the flavor of the tea.	-1
Johnson's product are a waste of money you literally just pay for the name. Being an African family with dry skin it's like rubbing scented water on. I have to reapply on my babies multiple times a day. So now I use Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Butter lotion for the whole family ages 1m - 25yrs.	-1
This lotion completely dried my skin out. The more I applied, the drier it became.	-1
Difficult to open.  What were they thinking?	-1
These drops don't do much for serious dry eye problems.	-1
They are described as long.  They are not.  Very dissatisfied with the product.	-1
This burns my eyes when I use it... which I find to be a little concerning... I've never had that happen before with eyedrops.	-1
These bandaids have no sticking power. They roll off and leave a sticky, flapping, fraying edge to annoy you.  Complete waste of money.  Get the Waterproof Tough Strips instead -they are made of a duct-tape type of fiber.	-1
They are too strong as the bandage leaves a lot of sticky residue when you try to remove it and the residue is difficult to remove.	-1
This bandage frays immediately and has very poor adhesive qualities.  Will never purchase again!!!	-1
Yes, Motrin is an effective children's pain and fever reducer.  BUT the fact is that the questionable artificial sweetener ACE-K is an actual ingredient here, 'snuck in' using it's extended name 'acesulfame potassium' on the label!  The safety of artificial sweeteners like ACE-K, Aspartame, Splenda, etc. has been long debated by credentialed scientists and specialists on both sides in many advanced industrialized countries.  Having read the great book 'Sweet Deception' by Dr. Joseph Mercola, I became one of the concerned ones regarding as to whether artificial sweeteners are safe or not.  Given the controversy, I feel it is prudent and wise to 'err on the safe side' and not imbibe any of them.  I find it upsetting that the makers of Motrin include ACE-K in a children's medication!  We truly do not know whether it is safe or not.	-1
Okay.	-1
Much shorter than I'd expected, and basically useless to me.  I'm sure there are people who like these. I'm not one of them.	-1
Really not my cup of tea., It's very large (see comparison with my toothbrush ) but the plastic feeling surface is very uncomfortable. Regret purchasing, and one of the 2 packages was damaged when I got it. (2nd picture)	-1
Kind of chalky	-1
not the scent of the hand soap, clear, unscented, correct packaging but not the normal contents.	-1
Dawn is better at cutting through grease. It's too bad because I love everything else about Method.	-1
Not impressed	-1
smashed!!	-1
I accidentally ordered the Coarse Metamucil with the white top.  It really is coarse and the taste, yikes. It might just be me but I think the orange top smooth Metamucil works better and is much more pleasant.	-1
First of all, "Force Flex" means these bags stretch.  What happens when things stretch?  The substance that they are made of gets thinner.  I have found that if there is anything broken, pointy, sharp or anything that can come through if the bag is full, the object goes right through.  Now, if you are merely placing paper in these, (we have to sort our garbage here in Austin - it's delightful!) these will work, but I have been buying lawn and leaf, and even though it's more money for fewer bags, I don't have a mess to clean up with a hole breaks though the bag.  So if you use these, just don't stuff them with pointy objects, or you will be picking up your garbage from the floor!	-1
I've ordered these bags for years, but now THEY CHANGED THEM! They are supposed to be more flexible now, but the only differences I can see is that they are now more grey than black, and EVERY bag of trash has holes in it. I've used about 15 bags so far. I'm kicking myself for ordering multiple boxes.	-1
These bags feel very very light and flimsy, I am having a very hard time trusting them. I find myself double bagging them for fear of them bursting open.   I will never buy them again, they may be tough and sturdy but they sure don't FEEL like it.	-1
Some of the cheapest napkins I have ever used. Prints are fun for the kids, but that is about it. Will not purchase again.	-1
I don't buy disposable napkins often, but I will not be buying the Mardi Gras brand again.  First of all, they are VERY thin -- much thinner than my previous napkins and, unfortunately, I don't remember what brand that was.  Also, I thought they were solid white, but they are printed.	-1
awwww, plain white napkins and they're thin. bummer. I was expecting a better quality napkin for Mardi Gras. A pattern of some sort would have made me happy. Ya get what cha pay for.	-1
These napkins were advertised as "prints" and were blank white.  The quality is ok but we only used printed towels and napkins and this was not as advertised.	-1
These have some dumb logo on them. It's like paying for takeout napkins. I'm a simple man. I like my napkins plain and white and well-absorbing and unpretentious.	-1
VERY light and they dissolve when they get wet.  P.S.--I am from the New Orleans area, but I do not like the napkins.	-1
vanity fair is the only decent brand. These are thin, thinner than toilet paper practically, and are annoyingly cheap.  No way you can eat daintily with these.  Ribs would be a disaster.	-1
My eyes hurt after applying these, almost like I would put an alcohol on my eyes. If you have sensitive eyes, don't buy it	-1
These actually burned when I first put them in, it faded after several minutes and I had no relief.	-1
VERY SMALL BOX.	-1
A less toxic option but I have to either rinse the dishes first, a big waste of water, or run the pots and pans cycle, a waste of water and electricity.  I'm using them up for lightly soiled loads, but will not buy them again.  Generally I like 7th generation products, but not this one.	-1
I have tried these for several washes.  Not one wash came out completely clean.  I loaded the dishwasher the same as I always do with our regular brand.  They never had trouble coming clean with our other brand, but I wanted to try to go to a more natural household so decided to give these a try.  I had to hand wash many dishes after they went through the dishwasher with these.  They left food particles on the dishes when the wash was done.  Not worth going natural when I have to wash the dishes by hand after the dishwasher runs or run the dishwasher twice.  I'm disappointed in these.	-1
Left residue and dishes did not appear clean.  I rinsed thoroughly before washing and used rinse treatment to no avail.  Maybe it would work better where water is softer but not effective at all here.	-1
I love Seventh Generation so was initially thrilled to find these. BUT, they are too thick to close the soap dish lid in our dishwasher. I've used PODS of other brands with no trouble. With these, I have to break open the pod and pour it in so all the convenience is lost. Once these are gone, I'll never purchase them again.	-1
This stuff tastes horrible and it does not make my mouth feel clean either.  The cheap stuff works better.	-1
Hurts my mouth, it says no alcohol but it still burned.	-1
In case anyone's interested, this puff corn contains GMOs. This isn't reflected on Amazon's product image; I discovered it on a bag I bought locally. This is really a shame, as I love these things.  Also, the price printed on the bag is $2.00. Amazon is currently selling it for $2.75. What's up with that?	-1
Taste good but way to small for my 15 yr old.	-1
Not worth it. Buy in store.	-1
Bugs in the bag	-1
don't make me puke...	-1
the birds like it, which means, yes, about as plastic tasting as this kind of food can get; nice and puffed up, bit of crunch, but taste buds scream the message it could be melted down to caulk windows	-1
The bag was already opened and damaged. Too bad because these are my favorite chips.	-1
smashed	-1
Chips good, packaging was horrible	-1
1 bag was broke open:(	-1
Mostly broken pieces.	-1
they were all crumbled	-1
These tortilla chips are WAY too salty!	-1
I see why these were on clearance. Broken up, stale. Yuck. Going in the trash!!! Waste of money.	-1
Oh my, these were really smashed. I had to laugh, but who puts chips in with can goods and juices.	-1
Crushed	-1
this bag santitas white corn tortilla chips were so crushed I had to throw them out for the birds to eat; the big box that it was mailed to me in was crushed so bad; I'm shocked that anything got to me in one piece.	-1
Smashed	-1
Chips are good. Shipping chips are bad. Get them at the store.	-1
One bag was opened.	-1
Must have been old they went stale after 3 days of being open	-1
It tasted too sweet. I really hoped that it would just be water with a splash of lemon. It almost tasted like over saturated lemonade. I didn't like the taste at all.	-1
Don't care for the taste.	-1
Too expensive	-1
These botlessons are way smaller than any I have ever gotten before. Not worth the price at all.	-1
One Gatorade  was busted	-1
When I read the ingredients, I had to give it away. Things I can no longer put in my body for health reasons.	-1
Purchased by mistake. Gross taste. Nobody in our home liked the taste. Maybe the low calorie gives it a bad taste. Now, I'm making sure to buy the regular fruit punch flavor.	-1
Only  the bagel  chips  came completely  opened	-1
sugar-free gatorade is not for me, I'll buy the other kind next time	-1
Expensive. The box they came in nearly broke the UPS person's back. They couldn't unload it. Ordering liquids is a dangerous gambit!	-1
it is what it is...prefer the mountain flavor	-1
I did not care for the taste.	-1
it was a little too sweet; even it doesn't have calories in it.	-1
Although having found this Black Cherry Propel to be the most flavorful of all the varieties, receiving short-dated and outdated freshness dates on these purchases has soured me on the buying experience. I did not have this experience with the four other flavors of Propel that I bought. What I assumed was a discount, was actually a clearance price, and should have been sold in the Warehouse department  (...and not in Prime Pantry). Based upon more than one experience, I will not purchase this product again.	-1
Prefer vitamin water zero by far	-1
Crazy thing... too Cherry. lol. Yeah you read that right. The flavor is over the top and strong. If you don't mind super flavored drink then no worries, but if you are looking for a mild flavored water this is definitely NOT for you.	-1
Don't care for the taste.	-1
I'm not too fond of the flavor but my husband seems to like it.	-1
Not a great taste.  Should have read the description better.  Thought it was just grape.	-1
I did not care for this much.  Weird flavor.	-1
These are really not for me.  They aren't horrible.  I just prefer the Sparkling Ice flavored water.	-1
I bought a 6-pack of Propel Kiwi Strawberry drink. It's probably all right and does everything it's supposed to do, but it's just too sweet. Sweetness is not refreshing to me. It makes me thirsty.  Gary Peterson	-1
Taste horrible! It taste more like tangerine than orange. I do not recommend and I will never buy again.	-1
Awful	-1
tastes like medicine	-1
Too expensive	-1
I really wanted to like Propel fitness water, which I purchased at my local supermarket.  But it has a horrible aftertaste. It isn't refreshing during, or after, a workout, because you're left with a sticky and fake sugar taste.  This berry flavor, in particular, tastes nothing like any real berries, nothing even remotely close.  I much prefer Hint brand waters, or using nuun tablets in a bottle of water.	-1
Pretty awful as snack right out of the bag, so discard that claim. But it does work well to put together a quick soup combined with broth and a handful of pasta. Wouldn't order again, though. because it is not particularly good value when I can just buy a bag of frozen mixed soup vegetables for a fifth of the cost.	-1
NY FRIEND AND I DID NOT CARE FOR IT	-1
Yeah.... no.  My kids tried but did NOT like these much.  I thought they tasted fine, but definitely not snack worthy.	-1
I didn't research carefully enough.  This was too short of me.	-1
MADE IN CHINA. OTHER POISE PADS ARE USA MADE.  WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN. I PLAN ON CALLING POISE CO. (CO THAT MAKE  POISE) and tell them that a Femine product made in CHINA, SHOULD BE STATED ON FRONT OF PRODUCT EASY TO SEE!  WOULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS BUT THAT IS NOT A OPTION.	-1
I ordered these because they reviewed well (at the time) and they were a great value, or so I thought.......  They are literally thinner than paper around the edges and the edges are half the liner. I'm strangely uploading a photo, haha... I took a pic over black fabric so you could see they are literally see through thin. The bill is just there to reference size.  I wouldn't use these on light days at all, they're just pretty useless. For everyday wear they also dissapoint in that they only stick to my panties (mostly Victoria's Secret, cotton) for maybe half the day. Beyond that, they fold down or bunch up and are just really annoying.  The only thing I prefer about these over the Carefree brand is that the box isn't as overly large. Individually wrapped is nice but not important to me. I'm frugal so I keep using them although I really feel they're just useless and I want to dump them in the trash, lol!  The fact that they are thong shaped didn't earn them two stars, in my opinion. Folding over any other liner (wings or not) would be better than these. They're also rather short in length but mainly just way too thin and they don't stick.  Needless to say, I won't be buying these again and I don't recommend them. Hope this helps someone! Smile.	-1
These are awful! They're so linty, and the box isn't heavy or strong enough to take a tissue out of the box without the box coming with it. The tissues tend to rip on the box as they're coming out as well. Just a terrible value overall. I'm going back to Scotties.	-1
FYI these are not flushable and will clog your toilet, septic system, or can cause sewer issues. Either don't get them or throw away instead of flushing	-1
They work ok but just don't get much for your money. I'd rather use baby wipes.	-1
I didn't think for a Scott product they're not a good value. TOO THIN, TEAR EASILY, SMALL, HARD TO HANDLE. I would NEVER PURCHASE THIS AGAIN.	-1
Came damaged. Boxes ripped somehow	-1
I purchased these to see how they would work for us. Simply put I wish that I didn't even bother. It was a experience and expense that we could have done with out. < CON'S - They don't fit behind all types of towel bars. - They are not even the size of a napkin unfolded. - It says 60 count but the box I received was lucky to have half the amount. - experienced  the same issue as tissues where the next towel  did not drop down. We had to fish for the next one, with wet hands.  I have no Pros that I am able to think of with this product. Grandma and I will go back to just using paper towels. One of the few products I would recommend skipping the experience altogether.	-1
when they say travel size they mean like fiat or matchbox car  travel size	-1
The huge opening lets the cloths dry out too quickly, my favorite is still the huggies.	-1
Wierd texture and not so moist	-1
Kleenex seems to have gone to a high lint factor method of manufacturing.  Have these on the night stand and after a couple of days and using one tissue the entire top is covered with tissue lint,  These seem to be on the cheap side of quality	-1
OK Kleenes Facial Tissues, 10 ct., 3 pac ...	-1
Rolls are very small ans with shipping cost makes them too expensive Go to Walmart	-1
Packs and tissues are getting smaller and smaller, courting uselessness.	-1
great deal	-1
like these very much stay together very well	-1
Did not work for me.  Donated them to charity.  Too exhausted from fighting with Amazon	-1
The fit is OK, bulky, but what I didn't like was the smell before even wearing them	-1
I won't be buying these again.  I found a brand that doesn't have a plastic guide to keep the next tissue sticking up.  (Search for "reach in".)  That plastic comes from fossil fuels, is not recyclable, has to be removed, ends up in landfills, and is not biodegradable.  How lazy are we that instead of putting our hands into the box, we have to ruin the planet?  We have a president who is unresponsive to environmental issues.  We must do more ourselves.	-1
Not very comfortable and tough to the skin	-1
Was this product....New and Improved?  Cause y'all need to bring back the Original.  Getting one of these sheets off the roll is like hand peeling the skin off a peach.  And when you do use a sheet it's like mopping up a spill using a plastic bag... I used to use these but never again.  I'm going back to Brawny.	-1
leaves lint on all surfaces even a face.	-1
Rolls were really tiny. Went through them in no time	-1
Leaves a really bad stringy and papery residue on everything, I hate it. . It'll stick to my hands, pans,dishes. . Everything!	-1
I didn't want the lotion and the designs on the boxes are quite ugly	-1
If you don't want to be inhaling a perfume smell then don't buy these. Made me sick.	-1
wasnt expecting large boxes thought they were cubes, they don't fit in any of my holders, but they work as expected	-1
I don't normally write an unfavorable review because I usually check things out before I make a purchase but after many years of using this product I find it to be inferior to what drew me to it in the first place. These were once good tissues but are now just expensive snot rags. These are not the old Kleenex and when they say things like Rely on durable, 2-ply thickness paper tissue sheets & Absorbent, disposable facial tissues lock in moisture its time for a reality check. The old 2-plys were much thicker & more absorbent and you could blow your nose, stick it in a pocket and itd be good to go for another use. One good blow into these and its a wet ball that stays wet while soaking pretty much the whole tissue. Im an average guy about 63 and 210-pounds and when my nose runs these are often good only for a single use but with a few blows they most often have to be tossed. Stick one in my pocket and itll be a solid wad when I pull it out. Ive even had to wash my hands because Im all wet with a single use. My wife is petite and has the same issues with these. I don't have any serious allergies or sinus problems but some mornings itll take 3-tissues to start breathing normally. If you're over 40 you know what I mean about the quality and thickness. Is it healthy to carry around a used tissue... probably not, but I don't care based on what these now cost. I find a paper towel just purchased a case of Sparkle to be much more effective and practical for me they're harsher but I get a lot of mileage for less expense. I think these are now about the equivalent of using the 1000-sheet Scott bathroom tissue on your nose so, perhaps, tissue now defines both products equally and you don't need to call them facial or bathroom. Since many used tissues likely go down the toilet we burn ours they have probably been thinned down to be more sewer system friendly. After complaining about them I will say they are much better than the off brands in the stores that have more per box and more economical than many of the brand names that offer fewer tissues per box. However, the deal of the day at the grocery store will be the way to go because paying a premium for these is just a waste on money. I went with 3-stars because the downsizing and thinning of products is growing tiresome like a 9-ounce potato chip bag that is labeled Family Size so end of rant.	-1
I don't know if Kleenex has changed its process or what, but this Kleenex has some issues I've never experienced w/any other tissue.  It's soft enough, and I guess the thickness is ok, but every time you pull out a tissue you get a shower of little "lint" balls.  Not just a couple, and it leaves a residue of tiny little balls all over the place.  Just weird.  It makes a mess, and I have enough to clean up w/o cleaning up that all day.  I will try something else.	-1
I really don't like how you Have to peel off each sheet off the roll	-1
Not a full size roll - these rolls a a rip-off - no bargain here - exceedingly soft and they don't service the purpose for which I purchased them.  These are miniatures rolls and deceiving.	-1
A Trump voter must have created these paper towels.  THEY ARE SO CLINGY you have to unroll them first, then re-roll them prior to use, or you risk pulling the whole roll down when you grab one.  They are only somewhat absorbent; but if SOFT is your sine qua non, then get them.  These are the softest paper towels I've ever encountered.  I leave the smallest size in the microwave to absorb moisture.  But again, so clingy that they don't STAY at the bottom of the microwave after you remove food, but CLING to the bottom of the bowl/plate, etc.  I never will buy them again for that CLINGY reason.	-1
To small	-1
It was a great price I just didn't realize the thickness of what I was ordering...	-1
Odd texture. Not obsorbant.  I'll save for cleaning the mirrors. Won't buy again.	-1
Wasn't really impressed. Left a lot of lint on any surface I used them on. Had to re-dust afterwards.	-1
I did not like these one bit.  I have used Kotex before but never the U ones.  These feel apart!  They ripped on the sides and the cotton went everywhere.  I tried like 5 out of the package.  I called the company and let them know then I threw them in the garbage.	-1
I bought these for my daughters thinking they would like the compact size better for carrying at school.  They didn't like them and said they had a lot of leakage.	-1
Not a fan.	-1
These are not great. I purchased them on a sale thinking their "super plus" rating would equate to their other super plus tampons, and I was wrong. I don't like these at all, and they don't have good absorbency.	-1
Paper towels wound so tightly on the roll you have to peel off each little sheet. Wont buy again.	-1
These were on sale so tried them but they are to difficult to use with the click design. I am not a fan and won't buy again.	-1
What a joke. The rolls are so thin, they look anorexic. Don't bother - a terrible value given how ridiculously skinny these rolls are. Each roll may last one day.	-1
Well, darn!  I bought these on Amazon Prime, thinking that Viva products are always among the best and most reliable.  Oh boy, was I wrong this time!  These Viva Chose-A-Sheet Paper Towels aren't worth the price.  The rolls are tiny!  "A paper towel is a paper towel is a paper towel"...nope, not in this case.  These are the smallest rolls of paper towels I've ever seen...you have to use twice as many for the same spill.  Guess I should have read the reviews instead of just believing in Viva!	-1
Initially, I tried giving these paper towels a two-star review, thinking that that was generous but not misleading.  But these paper towels really are poor quality.  I wish I had read others' reviews, but...paper towels are paper towels, right?  --Um...no, not so much.  How a reputable brand gets away with selling such a patently inferior product I do not know. What I DO know is that this is the last purchase of Viva paper products that I will ever make.  These paper towels come in comically small rolls, both length-wise and girth-wise.  They also aren't good quality paper towels: they are a lot less effective even in cleaning up the small messes one might reasonably have thought they could tackle.  Dollar store paper towels are better.  Note this, please:  I am not saying that these are not much better than dollar-store paper towels but rather that dollar-store paper towels are BETTER.  What a disappointment.  Caveat emptor.	-1
Rolls were so tiny..way too expensive for what they are. Not impressed	-1
ouch, leaves a burning sensation	-1
These are like miniature paper towels...  So tiny barley anything on the rolls	-1
Prefer Bounty, but it isn't a choice in consume and save	-1
The picture looks like the same rolls you would buy in Walmart or Target but it's not.  I was surprised at how small these rolls are. The store rolls are 100 sheets, these are only 66 sheets.	-1
Very cheap. I buy Viva at the store and I love them, but these are the small sheets.	-1
Tiny rolls, ply very thin.	-1
Smallest rolls of paper towel I have ever seen.  I was quite disappointed.	-1
Have  to admit, I'd never used these before but won't use them again. Love that you can choose the size but they are not easy to get off the roll and my family doesn't like the way they feel. Kind of fuzzy :/	-1
This is terrible packaging. 168 loose wipes in a resealable bag. Spend a few cents more and get smaller packs that fit into the the standard dispenser.	-1
Tiny little rolls. They are soft but you don't get much for the cost.	-1
terrible paper towels	-1
pads are too short, they leak, and the adhesive softens from the moisture and heat; then rips off the pad, sticks to your underwear, causes a big mess.	-1
I'm not happy with these compared to the ones you purchase in-store. I normally buy these from target when they go on sale, aside from them being  much smaller rolls than I find locally. They just don't have the same feel or even the same thickness that I'm used to. The texture is even different. I can see the reason for most of the positive reviews, these still are better than the average paper towel, but if you're not familiar with the ones I find at retail locally, you might think they are "normal". I'm aware maybe I got an 'off" batch of them, but I won't risk buying them again and the price really isn't close to any deal if you compare to how much more you get in the larger rolls for pretty much the same if not a lower price. And the consistency I get in the stores are a much softer feel and seem "fluffier". I'm a fan of the product but not this version of it.	-1
Very cloth-like unlike a standard paper towel. Small rolls and funny scent to them as well. Not a fan.	-1
