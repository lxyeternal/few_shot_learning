Thank you for your product	1
This is a fun game two play my brother own this product we had a good experience with this product	1
Works great and save good buy	1
Game was broken, wouldn't load up at at.	-1
Performed exactly as advertised. Internal battery worked and the game could save.	1
One of the best special edition pokemon games of all time.	1
One of the best Pokemon games, but be careful when you buy these used because the internal battery for holding saves could be dead.	1
not worth 50. returning. in bad condition. im not just paying for an intact sticker. I want a non-damaged game. your product descriptions shouldn't go by the label alone	-1
This is great if you have a Gameboy Color, but if you do have a DS, I would recommend Soul Silver or Heart Gold, the DS remakes of this game.  They are really faithful to the original and a great Pokemon game.	1
doesnt save	-1
Great game, arrived quickly and as described.	1
after trading a few times the time/day in the game changed had to start over several times the game was defective and i feally like the seller but will be more cautious	-1
Awesome but after not playing for awhile, the save data got corrupt! But its no biggie though as this is easy to fix...also doesnt hurt to play the game all over again for the nostalgic tones and feels!	1
Wow, this was a steal. Great price for a great game. I received this way before its estimated delivery date. They even had it pre-packed in a case for the cartridge and the original sticker still in tact.	1
Classic game. Super fun.	1
No one brought crystal simply because it's the same as gold ans silver. While this  may be true,crystal had more things to it that makes the game better. Crystal was a improvement,just like yellow was to red and blue. Crystal was a good game. It's sad because it only sold 1 million copies. Unlike the other pokemon games....    Improvements  1. You can chose genders-This is the best one,choosing to be a girl makes it feel more like a rpg. 2. Battle animations-When you go into a battle,the pokemon you face makes a little movement. Not to important,but still,cool. 3. New battle tower-At olavine,the route south to it has battle tower. You can battle pokemon there. 4. A story about suicone-Suicone is the mascot for Crystal. There is a story about it,and,you can catch it,by going to the bell tower at ecertect city. You don't have to chase it. You can just battle it.    Crystal better then gold and silver?  Pokemon Crystal has more things added. Does that make it better? Gold and silver were good the way they were,but,crystal still was made. Not many people owned crystal. But,crystal is better. More things makes it more fun. Also,bugs from gold/silver has been fixed with crystal. Not important,but better then gold and silver  There's not much to say about crystal,because gold and silver are so much like it. The three are all the same. But with more things,crystal is just better. Even if it wasn't that popular,crystal still is one of the best. A true classic.	1

thanks	1
my pokemon are level 15 and it saves and runs great so far. the cartradge was in great condition as well.	1
Never have I played a game which made me as nostalgic as this. Along with Emerald and the original 3, they are the only ones I have played (never wanted to try out pearl from gameplay videos) I give this a 5/5 mainly because my parents got me this the day it came out (I was 7) and I remember not actually getting kinda-bored of it until I hit 10 or 11. Yes it is based around Silver and Gold, but who cares? If you liked either and haven't burnt yourself out on them give it a go! (even though people try to rip you off massively for these new) *laughable $600 new on Amazon*.  Anyway, along with Emerald this is the only version I loved and wish my brother hadn't lost.	1
When I was just a wee lad way back when, I was on top of this game 's world. I nearly had every pokemon until it got old and apperently broke down on me. So I got this and it works well. Plays/saves well.	1
I love the inclusion of female trainer, cute prebattle animations, more subtle improvements, yet it more resembles Gold and Silver.	1
Been wanting this game for 5 years now I finally got it and didn't pay 200 or more bucks for it new. Used is fine and is no different. Always love it up to this generation. Anything past this is crap to me... actually after 250 pokemon, they are just dumb.	1
I was late to the "pokemon party" and this was my first pokemon game. It's cleaner than the red and blue versions but lacks the clutteredness of the later games. It's good, clean, classic fun and it's worth a look. If you've never played gold or silver, pick up Unlike emerald, which made weird coloration changes to the game, Crystal keeps it looking the same only better with animated pokemon.   Be warned though, this game is both harder and shorter than later games in the series. I got all 8 badges in about a third the time it took me to beat ruby and saphire. This is in no way a bad thing, just something to consider	1
Pokemon Crystal is an excellent installment of the Pokemon RPG series.  It features the game play that Pokemon fans know and love and adds new features in a new region to explore.  This game makes for an excellent trip down memory lane for Pokemon fans who played it when it was new or for an excellent new experience for Pokemon fans who have never played it.	1
a great pokemon game, we now have all the older games. next are new ones for dsi xl black and white,	1
Pokemon Crystal showcases everything that was awesome with the Pokemon franchise. It has everything the original games had, with about a million new features. If you enjoyed RBY, playing and beating it more times than you can count, then this will be the Holy Grail.  You play as Ethan (or Kris) as he travels through the Pokemon region of Johto, collecting little animals called Pokemon. Your goal is to collect all of the Pokemon, while defeating the eight gym leaders. There are some mini tasks along the way, but the ultimate goal is to become the Pokemon Master.  If you've played RBY, or just about any Pokemon RPG, then you shouldn't have a problem figuring it out. It's simple, yet engaging and entertaining. If you have this game in your collection, you will never turn off your Game Boy.	1
I think it is a great game and I will eventually own more of the pokemon games.	1
It's a sister game, and enhanced version of Gold/Crystal. If you own Gold, or Crystal, you probably won't want to buy this.  Even though I believe Platinum is the best to date, most people believe Crystal to be the best. I would say, wait a bit for Heartgold and Soulsilver, the DS remakes,to come out, but buy these if you want.  It's a very good game for the GBC and it's the first one to have a female option.	1
Pokemon Crystal is by far the best pokemon game ever made.  I am a subscriber to the pokemon becket magazine, and believe it or not, the pokemon company admits that they think this was their best one.  Remakes of gold and silver are being made, the japanese release date is september 12.  The american release date is so far assumed to be sometime in 2010.  Now for the time this game was released this had great graphics, and added a major change: the first game you could play as a girl.  Because of this more girls played the game making pokemon more popular.  More major changes are the ones that include the fact that there are ho oh and lugia and a manadatory legendary event.  This started the wake up the legends and catch them series that has gone on for a long time, which started with that guy on the front of the box, a suicune.  I know a guy who soft resetted to get a shiny suicune.  The starters are all new and hard to get unless you hack emerald or trade repeatedly, with chikorita, the grass type, cyndaquil, the fire type, and totodile, the water type.  Another great feature was you could go back to kanto and fight the gym leaders, with a new one and a shocking final battle.  The gym leader was blue, and i will leave the final battle on top of mt silver open for interpretation.  Raikou, Entei, Lugia, And Ho-oH were other legendaries avaible legitly in the game, the kanto legends are gone.  There is one more final pokemon to hack for, celebi.  And don't forget all the new pokemon, baby pokemon like pichu, and even the lovable pokegear!  So as i close this review, just remember that this game was, and is the best pokemon game out their.	1
Pokemon Crystal version is very fun. You have more secret to discover. If the Pokemon Fan want to play a game from the second generation ? I say Play Pokemon Crystal, this is the best of all.	1
This is, by far, one of the greatest games to be released ever. It may not have super fancy graphics or a shocking, deep, storyline, but Pokemon had its own unique charm that everyone can love.  Pokemon are mysterious creatures that live on Earth, or, possibly, an Earth-like planet. Each of them had unique and extraordinary powers. Currently, there are at least 400+ species of Pokemon, and about half of them live in Johto and Kanto combined. Those are the regions the game takes place in if you didn't know.  While the graphics aren't, they have their own style, using pixel pictures called sprites. Plus, the game was made a good few years ago, so you can't complain.  You start out as a young Pokemon trainer, (Male or Female) named _____. That's right, you can choose your own name too! My example trainer for today will be a girl named Kris.  Kris soon embarks on a journey, collecting gym badges to prove that she has what it takes to become a Pokemon Master.   Soon, Kris will encounter a boy named ??? (Guess what? You get to name your rival as well! Cool! I'll call him Silver.) Silver is a trainer whom Kris will battle often in her journey, who often caused trouble around Johto. Silver is a headstrong trainer who is not above abusing his Pokemon, and he is tough to beat, so make sure you level up your Pokemon often.  There are hundreds of types of Pokemon waiting to be caught, so there are many, many varieties. I'm sure there's at least one Pokemon out there that'll catch your interest. (Get it? Catch? And it's Pokemon? Catch? Do you get it?...okay, I'll shut up now.)  Plus, the more you battle with Pokemon, the more they like you! There's a girl in a city called Goldenrod who can tell you how much your Pokemon likes you. It doesn't really add anything to the story, (Or lack thereof, as the whole game is pretty non-linear) it's still cool to see whether your Pokemon loves or despises you. Certain Pokemon can only evolve through friendship, as well!  There is also a subplot in Pokemon Crystal involving a man named Eusine, and a Legendary Pokemon named Suicune. I won't spoil anything, other than the fact that you will team up with Eusine occasionally, and eventually battle him. Plus, there is the added bonus of a chance to battle Suicune! (And, if you're lucky, capture. ^____^)  Raising, Befriending, and of course, Battling Pokemon, is what it takes to become a Pokemon Master. The battles, for any concerned parent, are not violent, and despite what those Anti-Pokemon idiots claim, pokemon are not forced to fight, and for crying out loud, Pikachu is NOT the second coming of evil. (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, look around some of those, 'Anti-Pokemon' sites and see. Or, perhaps, don't.)  A wise quote from an in-game character:  "Pokmon are not tools of war..." - The Elder  So, to summarize my whole review in a sentence...  BUY THIS AWESOME GAME!!  [...].	1
Pokemon Crystal is the very first video game I ever owned, so it holds a special place in my heart.  It's incredibly fun (this holds true for all Pokemon games), the graphics are very nice, and--best of all--for the very first time, YOU GET TO PLAY AS A GIRL. That's right; Nintendo finally acknowledged that girls like Pokemon too.  I wonder why they didn't think of it before. Besides having the option of playing as a girl, there are a number of other added features Gold and Silver didn't have.  The Pokemon are animated when they show up, there are some new radio programs, you can get Suicune in a regular Pokemon battle instead of chasing him all over the galaxy, and the first time you go to the breeding center, you get a Pokemon egg that will hatch into one of many new "pre-evolution" Pokemon, with a fifty percent chance of being Shiny. The only drawbacks I can think of with this game are that you can't get Mareep or Mewtwo.  But even that isn't such a problem, because there is such a thing as trading with another game (excluding Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Fire Red, Leaf Green, Colosseum, etc.).  In conclusion, this game may be more or less "out of print", but if you're a Pokemon fan and you don't have it, I highly recommend purchasing it.	1
For people who have started to read my reviews I am a all time gamer, and this is my all time favorite game. This game is LOADED with stuff to do, figure out puzzles, capture pokemon, win battles and more! Here are the good and bad in my opinion:  Good  -Loaded with stuff takes a while to play (a good thing)  -So many pokemon to catch and raise  -The battles bring out the true trainer in you  -The pokemon now make noises and move when summoned  -You can choose gender  Bad  -Sometimes you can get very stuck  -Some of the puzzles need the game guide to figure out in my opinion  -The graphics aren't as good nowdays    Note that all the pokemon games are good and that I think this game appeals to all ages.	1
Came out, daughter had to have. Daughter got to have. Any new video game is a must, but some just would spell death not to have. She has been non stop on this thing for 5 hours, my neck hurts just thinking about it. She seems to be quite content to sit on the sofa and play.	1
Well, the first reason I got Crystal is to actaully get Celebi, but when I learned it you need the Mobile Adapter that is only in Japan to get, I was really sad about it, now I want the japanese Pokemon Crystal. Well, there is a lot of new stuff on Crystal so I gave it five stars. Like, the Annon or Unknown puzzles are different, you get to catch both of what Gold and Silver has, Girl or Boy Trainer, when you see a Pokemon it moves for a second, Suicane is now a big deal of the game, small graphics improvement in places, Team Rocket now I believe is a bit harder, a Pokemon Place where you get to fight other trainers in a huge building, there is a Password Station where every night you get to win a point and you can save for cool prizes, the starting is a bit different, people now trade different Pokemon, getting the Squirtbottle is on a bit different, and the order to beat Team Rocket is now Slowpoke Tails, Lake of Rage, Goldenrod City, and then Powerplant. Well thats 13 changes to the game from Gold/Silver to Crystal, I think you should get Gold/Silver first before Crystal because Crystal is a lot more for the people who played Gold/Silver if you catch what I mean. Graphics, a bit better then Gold/Silver: 9.5/10 Fun, I believe this is more fun cause you got more things to do: 9.5/10 Gameplay, you can play this about 2 hours more then Gold, but in my Gold I'm not finished and I have 80 hours: 10/10 Sound, a new cool radio station plus all Gold/Silver stations: 10/10 Overall, 10/10, I really want you to get this if you don't have it and you have beaten Gold/Silver.	1
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST POKeMON games I've ever played! This game you can actually capture Suicune, get the Crystal Bell goto the tower, face the wise sages, defeat them, goto the tower where Suicune wishes to meet and challenge you, save before you enter the tower, take on Suicune, have Ultra Balls, capture him and you'll beat the rest of the game no sweat! Level up some strong POKeMON against Ash, yes you POKePlayers, Ash, Pikachu is probably the only POKeMON to give you any real trouble! Ohter than that, the game's a piece of cake! Extra features include "Battle Taunts" (POKeMON taunt other POKeMON when comming out, map, so when you enter a new town, you don't worry about getting lost and other trainers say a lot more things than what they say in the fist two installments. Than the rest is the same!!!	1
Yet another development on the previous Pokmon games for the Game Boy series, Pokmon Crystal has not disappointed. It has new and improved graphics, new animation, and, finally, a girl character ^^ (woo-hoo!) You can choose between the boy and the girl, however the only difference is the appearance of your character. The way people talk to you and the storyline does not change. This game is VERY similar to its immediate predecessors, gold and silver. One major difference, however, is that you get a good shot at capturing Suicune without looking for it in the grass, and you also get little markers on your map showing you the other 2 legendary beasts' current locations if you have been lucky enough to spot them once. My only complaint about this game would be that as having played these games since Red/Blue were popular (and almost impossible to get), I am getting burnt out. It is beginning to be the same old thing over and over. I remember when Red, Blue, and even Yellow version used to keep me entertained for hours, but when Gold and Silver came out it was beginning to get tiresome. I have not even bothered to beat Crystal just because I know it will be the same ending. Anyways, it's a good game overall, so try it if you're not already bored with the games.	1
Pokemon Crystal for the Game Boy Color is one great game. This game perfectly brings the hit television show to a GBC video game. There are plenty of features in this game that will keep you playing for hours. There are many new Pokemon and 251 in all that you need to capture to beat the game. As you travel along there are a lot of other trainers who will challenge you to battle. You can choose to play with either a boy or a girl trainer which is a nice new feature. Buena, a radio DJ in the radio tower of Johto will give out a password every day and if you go to her and recite the password she will give you points to redeem for great prizes including ultra balls for 2 points, full restore for 2 points, nuggets and rare candy for 3 points, protein, iron carbos, calucim and HP ups are a 5 points each. These prizes help a lot to train your Pokemon and keep them healthy. Bringing Pokemon onto the Game Boy Color with Pokemon Crystal was a great choice of Nintendo. I highly recommend this game to any GBC owners, especially Pokemon fans. Check out Pokemon Advance which includes over 345 Pokemon for the Game Boy Advance in the Fall of 2002!	1
Yes, Pok&eacute;mon Silver is the best out of all of them. I loved Blue, Red, Gold & Silver but this is the most advanced! Well, first off, you can choose to be a boy or a girl, there's new pok&eacute;mon and they all move! When you go into a attack with someone or encounter a wild pok&eacute;mon they move in their own special way. It's sooooo cute! This game is riveting, and keeps you hooked for hours on end. I managed to finish it (in between listening to CD's, watching DVD's, reading books and playing other PC games), and felt very pleased with myself. It's like Pok&eacute;mon gold or silver, but more advanced. If you're a pok&eacute;mon fanatic or just like fun, cute games, this is for you. Buy it today.	1
In one word......awesome. If you liked the gold & silver ones this is even better. Suicune challenges you to catch it instead of running away like in the gold and silver games. There is also a new radio show were you can get items if you listen to it. And in this game you discover the secret of the unnown when you do certain things at the ruins of alph. It is the best game I have ever played that is in the Pokemon series. I would reccomend to anyone to at least try it. You don't want to miss out on this!	1
Pokemon Crystal Version is a good game but too similar to Gold and Silver to be a must-have game, unless you don't have either of these games or you just need to complete your Pokemon collection.   In this review, I would also like to clear up a few false rumors. 1. In the American version, you cannot catch Celebi. 2. The game also does not have mobile phone capabilities. This was featured in the Japanese version of the game,but it was withdrawn from the American version.   There are a few "crystal-clear" differences from this game and the Gold and Silver editions. You'll notice these differences as you play.   As I mentioned before, this game is not recommended to anyone who already owns Gold and/or Silver version.	1
This a a great release for Sega Dreamcast owners. The ATARI ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION is compilation of 12 Atari ARCADE games. These are not emulations of 2600,5200 or 7800 Atari games. These 12 games are perfect emulations of 12 classic arcade games that you are sure to have nostalgic feelings for. The games are as follows:ASTEROIDS, ASTEROIDS DELUXE, BATTLEZONE, CENTEPEDE, CRYSTAL CASTLE, GRAVITAR, MILLIPEDE, MISSILE COMMAND, PONG, SUPER BREAKOUT, TEMPEST, and WARLORDS. Did any of these game titles evoke fond memories? Can you remember the arcade you were in and the sounds of these games? If you are such a person, get the ATARI ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION is a must buy title! You also get slideshows on each game. The slideshows show the cabinet and also some of the papers that arcade owners got with the machines as well as magazine ads for the games. Plus, it shows the artwork and what the 2600 and 5200 cartridges looked like. Almost all of these games are highly addictive and I remember playing most of these in the arcades. All of the games are simple to learn and a lot of fun! Highly recommended!	1
These games are some of the best games ever seen in arcades. Back in those days you had to rely on great gameplay, not great graphics. Of all the games on this CD, Tempest is my favorite. It is considered the most popular arcade game in history, and I know why. But all the other games deserve mention, too. Centipede is a top-quality shooter, Asteroids is another fun shooter (with some nice vector graphics), Millipede is the sequel to Centipede with tons of added features (and more enemies), Gravitar is a VERY challenging game, Crystal Castles is a fun game with fantastic isometric graphics (a trackball or mouse should be used with Crystal Castles), Pong is the grandfather of arcade games (it's still very fun after almost 30 years), and Super Breakout takes Pong's "ball and paddle" format to the next level in a very entertaining way. I think this is the only Atari collection available for Dreamcast, so if you want classic Atari games on Dreamcast, then get this quick.	1
Artari.  Every gamer knows this legendary company by heart.  Because Atari made the first game ever: "Pong."  And with Pong came "Centipede," "Asteroids," "Tempest," and many more!  Soon Colcovistion and the dreaded Nintendo would come along and boot Artari out of bussness...but their legendary games will live on forever!  Now thanks to Infogames the legacy of Atari lives on!  Now you can enjoy 12 Atari classics on your Sega Dreamcast for one low price (...) Now keep in mind these games aren't state-of-the-art, they're graphics are not buffed out, and the gameplay most of the time only requires the D-Pad/Analog and the A-Button!  Yes folks, this is classic gaming at it's best!  While new gamers who started out playing games like "Metal Gear Solid" will look at these games in disgust adult gamers who grew up with these game will relive their childhood memories one last time! The only real gripe I have with this collection is that the controller for the Dreamcast is a little sensitive for these games, and therefor will take time getting use to before you will actually sit down and enjoy the game...but that's only a miner flaw!  Once you get the controlls down get ready to relive your childhood memories with "Atari: Aniversary Edition!"	1
Bloody Roar 3 is a good fighting game. There is a nice variety of moves, the graphics are awesome, and the beast mode is really cool. It is a great, fast paced fighting game. If you can unlock it, check out the sumo mode. The first person to knock their opponent into a wall or into the floor wins. This takes a lot of strategy to win and is worth the effort. It is a great game to play with a group of friends. The only thing that is lacking is the storyline. It is rather vague, and the endings are little slideshows with text. This does hurt the game, but I never really need a story in a fighting game to enjoy it.	1
For an actual game, this is not all that bad.  True, there is no true story mode, but then again who plays a fighting game for a Final Fantasy style Story anyways (If you do then you need to send an Email to the makers of Fighter Maker and tell them to make a mixture of Fighter Maker and RPG Maker).  Any ways the story in the third chapter of this unique series is that one of the Lycanthropies (Animal People) has palced a death cure on all of them, to stop this the others from the first game (and more) reemerge to stop this mad man.  Villians and Jeros unite (sort of) to stop the villian. As most fightign game gamers know by now that the best part of this game, and most unique aspect is the ability to transform into animals and brawl from there.  From the ferociouse looking Wolf and Lion cahracters, to the deceptivly tame looking Kitty and Rabbit, all of them can kick some seriosue ass.  Also there are no projectiles whatsoever in this game.  In other words if you are used to fireballing someone to death than you are in seriosue trouble buddy. The music for the game is typical arcade style. Loud video game style Rock and Roll.  Which is fine, it doesn't distract nor add anything, it just gets the gamer adrenaline pumping a little. The best part is how easy this is to pick up and play, within a matter of minutes you can be as powerful as someone who has played games for a long time.  This is definetly worth checking into.	1
Didn't work	-1
Excellent condition. Very happy with this purchase. A++	1
Best bloody roar game out there, they really should remake this. But definetly the best BR to get	1
Love this game.	1

Disc was clean, case was nice. Me and my friends have spent countless hours during the summer with Bukaryu vs. Yugo matches! I used to have this game when i was younger and it brings back so many memories!	1
Well I love Fighting Games and I think this one makes a good Deference from the others I have Played	1
excelent fighters when transform in the animals is one of the best games ever done because the transformations are the best of the best	1
Love this game a lot.  Just replaced it because the old one was scratched up.	1
This game is really deep, it is deeper than Tekken but not more so than Virtua Fighter 4.  First of all pressing forward and block allows your character to do a dodge move, that will render most attacks useless. Then there are air combos that can be linked to super moves via Street Fighter EX series. All the characters are totally different with the exception of two that are a shells of each other. I have had this game for two years and I am still playing it.  The best way to reach the full potential of this game is to study the ending sequence and take notice to the combos that the developers do, then you will see how deep this game really is...	1
The first rank of fighting games, and the select group of developers that make them, is defined very clearly in this day and age. Ask more or less anyone, and they will tell you: there is Namco, there is AM2, there is Team Ninja, and then there is Everybody Else. Or to put it more appropriately, there is nobody else. Tekken, Soul Calibur, Virtua Fighter and Dead or Alive have captured the lion's share of the attention in the genre since the peak of the Playstation era, when DOA came out of nowhere to become a recognized contender. Which Bloody Roar never quite was. Raizing's lycanthropic fighter had two outings on the PlayStation, both localized by Sony and met respectably at the box office, but the franchise never seemed to earn the respect that Dead or Alive pried loose from the market and that Tekken and Virtua Fighter seemingly possessed by default. DOA's next-generation debut received a flurry of hype and anticipation, while the eventual arrival of Bloody Roar 3 on System 246 and PS2 barely raised eyebrows. Unfair? To a degree. Bloody Roar 3 is not the toe-to-toe equal of Soul Calibur or Tekken Tag Tournament, and it's not as ambitious as DOA2 in some ways, but it's undeniably fun as a solo or multiplayer game, and every so often it throws out a moment of serious graphical flair. It's certainly worthy of its American release, which has come thanks to Activision, and it's worth the attention of those looking for something off-beat in a fighting game. Bloody Roar's gimmick is the inclusion of monstrous alter egos for each of its characters -- the werewolf's the cover boy, but there's also the were-leopard, the were-lion, the were-tiger, the were-rhino beetle, and something called the Unborn, the definition of which has never yet been satisfactorily explained. The cast runs the gamut of visual and technical fighting styles, both in and out of their bestial forms, which they can swap between almost at will. "Almost" is the kicker, though. The game's chief strategic element involves managing the energy meter that allows the transformation, and knowing when to use the extra attacks that it enables. See, characters can fight in human form, but not nearly as effectively as when they're packing giant fangs and sharp claws (or antennae, or giant prehensile spiky things, or floppy ears and a cotton tail). Beast form enables stronger combos, and you can sacrifice your entire store of beast energy on the gamble that as a massive Beast Drive -- hit or miss, you return to human form, but it's worth it if you can land in excess of 20 hits. Offensively, then, Bloody Roar 3 has a lot of flash and a reasonable amount of depth. The combo scheme should be familiar to someone with a grasp of Dead or Alive or the more basic elements of Tekken -- characters have a decent-sized selection of attacks based on directional movements and the two attack buttons, with preset combos generally ranging from two to six hits (although a few stretch up to eight or so low-power strikes). Like DOA, though, linking attacks is generally determined by the canned strings or by staggering your opponent (which works more or less as in DOA2). There's a little less emphasis on developing original combos, although you can still devise some very clever linked attacks by studying how the stagger system works and what effect the walled arenas have on combat. It's the defensive system rather than the offensive system that feels a little less deep than some. Bloody Roar 3 includes a simple, easy-to-use sidestepping system, with up and down mapped to the lower shoulder buttons, but it's not the equal of the reversal scheme in DOA or the complex parry/reversal/sidestep system that Tekken's evolved over the years (you haven't seen real fighting sausagedom until you've seen someone chicken an attack in Tekken Tag). Defense in fighters has evolved a lot in recent years, and Bloody Roar 3 definitely feels a bit behind the curve.	1
Bloody Roar 3 is pretty cool. It plays almost exactly like the original Bloody Roar but with better graphics and it's also a lot faster in gameplay, the fighting is incredibly fast faced. The super moves are really cool to watch and all out, this game was pretty good. I have to admit, I wasn't impressed with the long, boring endings that made very little sense to me. The only other thing that bothered me, slightly, was the game's fast paced fighting. Now I realize that I said that the faster game part was a good thing but it's also a bad thing. The reason I think it's a bad thing too is because now, any series of strikes and special moves can become a vicious combo making it very difficult to make a comeback or a return onslaught to your opponent. The other thing that might bother others is the replay value because there isn't much. There is the story mode and then there is the Survival mode. After that, there's really no where else to go unless you and your friends have a Versus mode battle. Even so, if you're considering a different kind of fighting game, seriously consider this one because Bloody Roar 3 will really challenge you. Have fun!	1
Just like the 1st and 2nd Bloody Roar on playstation it is a master piece. This time the graphics are so much better and have an extra 2 unlockable characters. the controls are easy and the arena interaction is fun to. but apart from bloody roar 2 there is no seperate story mode.	1
This game is an embarassment to the power of the PS2 console. The graphics looks like psx graphics. The handling is the worst. The tracks are narrow. The games loading takes a long time. The so called car settings are minimal. The AI on hard mode are doing some ridiculous lap times. I am sorry I would not recommend this game to anybody. It had a lot of potential and asssitance should have been sought in the games' development. I am sorry the truth is the truth.	-1
Let me just say this once...RIP OFF! Games can be hard at some points, and its sometimes hard to get the most coolest weapons, items, etc. Well, O.K. but, thats why there are strategy guides. Gameshark gave me alot of codes to get my HP and MP higher, also weapons, items, and I finally killed Evrae on Final Fantasy 10. But listen to this, I had this game shark for about 5 to 6 months and yeah that does seem along time but... 1.) I put the gameshark disc into the PS2 2.) It started to load...then said DISC READ ERROR After that I took the disc, cleaned it and the PS2 but still didn't work after that. SAVE YOU MULA ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT W O R K S for your lifetime! Oh, excuse me I left something else... it ERASED my important battle skills and my peoples HP. And when I tried to beat this one boss, it had more HP then its suppose to be. Like the bosses HP was suppose to be 100,000 when it turned the HP into MAYBE atleast a million!	-1
InterAct have recently replaced the GameShark2 v2 with a new GameShark2 v3. The codes for the v3 are incompatible with the v2 codes, and vice versa. InterAct are no longer publishing v2 codes for current games. You can buy an upgrade to GameShark2 v3, but you have to send back your v2 CD... meaning you're without the codes for your older games. So it looks like InterAct wants to try and push people to go out and buy a whole new GameShark2 v3, so they get more cash. Meanwhile, [...] has codes for GameShark2 v2, which was actually the Action Replay unit under a different name. So rather than being forced to pay InterAct for a v3 upgrade, go there instead!	-1
Have you ever had one of those moments when you've played a whole game, found yourself facing the very last boss and, just as you reach for your sword/wand/ray gun, gotten blown clear into the next universe?  Repeatedly?  Have you ever had to spend two thirds of your game time leveling up and still found no way to get in more than two lucky hits?  GameShark2 was made for those moments - it helps you cheat. I'm not going to argue the ethics of deciding when you need a crutch.  For some of us, a little extra time and power to figure out what is going on and how to fix it is worth hours of frustrating or tedious game play.  Game play is about having fun, not beating your head against the wall.  GameShark2 is my last resort when I have spent an entire weekend trying to get past a single challenge. For all its miraculous powers, GameShark2 has some serious drawbacks.  For one thing, unless what you want is very straightforward, it is difficult to use.  To keep up with new games (or extended cheats for old ones) it is necessary to visit GameShark's web site any print out the new cheat codes.  How to enter those codes is a both mysterious and clumsy.  And if the don't seem to work, it can be just as frustrating as getting stuck in the game can be. When you finally master the clumsiness, GameShark2 is often a game saver.  And I guess that it keeps karma balanced if it is a bit of a challenge to cheat.  The price is reasonable, and this is the most versatile of the cheating tools available.  Just be prepared to read a manual full of tiny, tiny print.	1
I have to say, since I have a Hih version PS2, my gameshark works well all the time, but hears the main flaw, I have a gameshark 2, and codes for the games I want only work on gameshark 3!  Games like Splinter Cell(Which I really need codes for, badly), Xenosaga(So I can play it again, and have no trouble), and a lot of other games.  This is major BS!!  I brought this in december, now it's like a useless piece of garbage!  Why can't I upgrade this or something?!  Well one things for sure, I'm not spending another 40 bux for another gameshark, just to play my new games. I'd rather beat it on my own.  If you don't have a gameshark, and need one, get version3, but then they'll screw you over in the future when version 4 comes out.  Interact is just too greedy for their own good.  Well, their not getting their grubby hands on my money for a long time, or maybe never.	-1
Just purchased this thing a few hours ago. I have yet to see it work. It's going back to the store.	-1
You must be extremely careful when entering codes with this product, and many cheats that adjust "inventory" for your character(s) should be saved on a different save slot than your regular saves. The reason being is there often is a glitch in the saved game data while the gameshark codes for adjusting the inventory are on. I found it best to cheat the inventory, save, reset, turn those inventory codes off, and resume/load. If you intend to use this to move game saves around, look somewhere else. An 8mb cartridge with 15 saves took FOREVER to load the directory, and another eternity to perform the requested operation. I have to mark off a point from perfection just for this performance issue alone. (I'm using GS2 v2.) I also would encourage simply using the PS2 by itself to view DVDs, or get the Sony DVD remote and software accessory. I don't believe the GS2 has any specific advantage to being used as a DVD player. If you don't have a lifetime to master the technique required to defeat a boss, earn an item of equipment, survive a specific challenge, or progress past a certain point in the game, this product enables you to get over these hurdles, if in a somewhat technical, sometimes confusing, way. Especially if it's a game you have to enter codes for. Entering 16-digit hexadecimal numbers (sometimes 10 of them at once) to workaround your game problem can be a bit daunting. My wish is that they would allow you to burn a CD on a regular PC CD-R drive that this product could read and use as an update to its code library.	1
You'll find 6 more previously unemulated Atari classics plus an interview with the legendary Nolan Bushnell on this disc. Plays well on the original Playstation, but the game has display issues when run on a Playstation 2 or original model Ps3 when playing the Vector titles.  If you have the aforementioned hardware, look for "Atari Anthology" on Playstation 2.  Great for the whole family	1
I love this because it gives me the chance to play the old school games that I used to play on Atari.	1
nice collection of games.  wish they included space invaders.  do not care for space duel.  not bad for the price.	1
Some of the best Atari releases. Plays really well as it is analog enabled. This game will definitely bring you back to the days of youth.	1
This has to be the most important review for this system because it will help you decide if the PS2 is right for you. I brought mine back in November 2001 & it started malfunctioning in January. (ONLY AFTER 2 MONTHS!?!?) Now I'm not sure it it's my fault or sony's human error. On their part the diagnonsis function does NOT work & in my opinion I found it to have no function. What I did was buy the already upgraded gameshark 1.9 on an auction website & it started messing up after that. Besides that, Gameshark.com aka interact accs. tells up to use only their codes in which I did, I haven't used any codes out side gameshark.com. Some of their codes do NOT work but they self-rightously claim that their codes work 100%. I even told them that I triple check codes for validity! With my 1.4 version PS1 gameshark brought in March 1997 & upgraded to 3.2 in November 1998- My 1997 Playstation 1 lasted for 2 years (Until July 1999) before I got the 1999 version which lasted for another 2 years!! (Until August 2001) I think that this is sony's FK up as they built the Playstation 2 to resist the gameshark. Let me just say that as long as there are video game systems that there will also be gamesharks, but there should NOT be intentional malfuntions to snatch more $$ from the average consumer! Oh, but wait! Currently my playstation 2 still does play the regular blue disks but not the silver dvd roms or dvd movies!-This has been many dollars for my thoughts.. not including the other games that I brought & do not work. Sony should just drop the price of the console already because the original price was not worth it!	-1
GameShark 2 let you enter codes that will unlock hidden features or give you extra bonus for PS2 games. New codes are added to their website each day and there are tons of them for each game.  It is a great add on and will surely saves you tons of time and frustrating. Couple bad things about it is that you need to use its CD to load it up each time and switch CDs to play the real game later.  And inputting code using the controller can get hard when you have tons of code to enter. (Have everything cheat in FFX has about 40 lines of code to enter, each are 16 characters long), so if you use it often, you may consider buying the keyboard as well.	1
I havn't had much problems, but on the side that you have a 50% chance of it not working, Wait... there is a word for that, It's called a SCAM! You can't enter your own codes for the PS1 disc you have to buy a stupid upgrade disc that doesn't even have the codes you want! For example I have a code for Spyro the dragon to "Fly instead of glide" now I can't get that on my PS2 now can I?!?!? because I can't enter it in or get it on the upgrade disc! Save your PS1 GS it is 100 times better!	-1
So far I had 2 gamesharks, both of which were defective. However, I was lucky enough and my PS2 din't mess up, but if you do use this [terrible]peripheral you'll probably end up buying a new PS2.  As far as the product itself it's ok, but it will mess up soon enough. So, if you want a cheating device, I'd suggest code breaker, it's better and has a better (and wider) variety of cheats, and if you can't find a cheat for that use one for the gameshark, and it will work!  I am very dissapointed in Interact, I lost all faith in them. ...If you already have a gameshark go get your receipt and hold on to it, and when it breaks take your money back and go get the Codebreaker.	-1
If you can, find another cheat device. Eighty percent of the people I have talked to(500 people or so) have said their's lasted a max of four months and then had a fatal glitch. Mine lasted a little over three. The gameshark deleted 90% of my codes and garbled the other 10%. To top it off I can't even reload them because of a "Hardware not detected" error. THIS IS COMMON AND CAN'T BE AVOIDED. It's a piece of junk. I'm looking into the Pelican code breaker mentioned by one of the other reviewers. It has to be better than this. Save your money or buy something else.	-1
The GameShark2 can be either useful or detrimental.  While I own one, I personally try to do as much as I can with each game, then turn to the GS2 if I get stuck, or want to restart the game without starting at the VERY beginning (such as in skipping the license tests in Gran Turismo 3); in these cases, the GS2 is useful.  Of course, those who buy a game, enter in every GS2 code imaginable, and start cheating immediately have fallen into the GS2's detrimental grip. The only main drawback to the GameShark2 is the inability to enter in numbers and some symbols when adding new games and codes.  Of course, this probably forces customers to buy the SharkBoard, which is compatible with GameShark2 Version 1.4 or later.	1
In short, this is a great product.  I buy one for every console I use (got three of them now).  Mostly, I value the service from gameshark's website as they promptly get the latest codes published often before a game is even officially released. Sometimes one just doesn't have the patience to play a game 15 times just to get the "killer weapon" (i.e. rocket launcher in RE) or final secrets *after* the game has already lost much of its repeat play value. Indeed Gameshark can actually improve a game's "fun quotient".  For example, Fear Effect I at points was way too hard with much playtime being used to reload saved games.  I was able to give myself additional almo which increased my satisfaction with the game.	1
When I looked at the cover, I was convinced that this is a good game. Indeed, this game delivered a solid RPG gameplay. However, as I compared it to FFX, this game was lacking. It has no characters vocal, no point of destination, and the game repeated for several times. The graphics was not so good, which made me lost my interest in playing this game until the end. The monsters were not as unique as other RPG games.  It's really fun to play a musical instrument (a guitar). I get hooked by the mini games. Although it has a variety of songs, it only based on one song. The last song that Mouse should performed to Xelpherpolis was so difficult. The rhytm was so fast. Seriously, this game needed some modifications before it was released to the market. I hoped Konami will remake this game^O^. Please rent this game before you buy it. If you're satisfied, then purchased it later.	-1
Ephemeral Fantasia is one of the biggest games out there on the PS2. It combines all the natural elements of a great RPG, storyline, battle system, characters, music, and minigames. Right when I started this game, I knew it would be a long game. You play as a a musician, Mouse, who has been hired to play at the princess's wedding on the island of Pandule. Only when you arrive, a dark secret about the island is revealed. The game is seperated into weeks with a monday tuesday type system, with a clock as well. You have to use the clock to meet certain people at the right time or complete a certain event. Timing is EVERYTHING in this game. The island itself is giant, with tons and tons of characters to interact with. The island has 49 different map pieces you can collect, to show you around the island. It is just huge, with about 5 towns you can visit. Try and find shortcuts. The game contains 12 characters you can recruit onto your team. It will take time, patience, and thinking to recieve each character..... The battle system is in real time so you must choose your attacks fast to avoid being attacked yourself. There are different skills you can learn called Arts. Make your Arts grow levels and you might learn a knew attack. You can also learn different attacks from you teammates, as well as tons of magic. I was blown away by the variety in this game. But what is a game without the proper music. Have you ever played a game with the volume on mute? Well its pretty hard to play like that. This game have the coolest music, where ever you go, battle, or outside. You can also add on replay value to the game by using your guitar, Pattimo, to play different music, that is a very fun minigame, as well as Death Hykato raising, and tons more. But seriously, Ephemeral Fantasia is a really cool game, with endless replay value, and pure fun. I would reccomend this game to all RPG players alike, this game is definatley a must buy for the PS2	1
Why is it that every time a new game system comes out (in this case, the mighty PS2), companies flood the market with poor games, sometimes with graphics which would be a letdown on an OLDER machine, sometimes with gameplay that will put a razor to your wrist, and sometimes games that just out and out suck on all fronts?   While Ephemeral Fantasia may not be the worst game ever made, it is certainly a disappointment, especially when one considers the fact that it was released by Konami. I tried, I mean, I REALLY tried to get into this game, but it is just horrible. Yeah, the minigames are fun (hey, I gave it 2 stars), but please, PLEASE steer clear of this travesty of an RPG. I want my money back...	-1
This game started off quite well. But it has flaws that just detracts from the game so much. A serious lack in the ease of finding the plot. After a while it can be tricky to have any idea what the character is meant to be doing. Alot of rpg's spoon feed the plot. This ones becomes so hidden that you are left wondering what is the point. The graphics are ok, but the repetative use of graphics makes the game not only harder to navigate but also visually dull. It just lacks deapth and interest. Interesting characters like rummy just are not in it enough. There are better rpg's out there and there will be better ones for the PS2 coming.	-1
My head is pounding. Could the plucktastic sound track composed by zamfir and his mighty flutepeckers be the cause? Or might it be the tepid time traveling plot that is causing my neck muscles to contort in vulcan death grip style?I think it might be the horrid translation that is not only lacking strength and integrity,but is also filled with grammatical pitfalls carl lewis couldn't jump. Where's my aspirin?The mini games and such are nice distractions from the rudimentary battle system,and some incorporate the use of Konami's Guitar Freaks controller,only available as an import. But the scale of the town maps and the repetitive graphics make navigating around the map a laborious chore. And wait til you get into fisticuffs with the enemy. It looks like they spent about seven polygons on the whole works,making EF look like a high res Aidyn Chronicles. The best thing about the game is the triangle button which throws the game into fast forward. It's light hearted fare,which is a relief from the usual D and D but this is not a very good RPG.	-1
Those gamers who are familiar with Konami's other games will be in a for a real treat with this one. Most of Ephemeral Fantasia's problems arise from the fact that it wasn't created by Sqauresoft. Like Suikoden, the graphics aren't stellar and the music gets a little repetitive, but what it lacks in these areas it makes up for in involving storylines, multiple outcomes, an innovative and complex battle system, and challenging real-time elements. The positive aspects to this game far out-weigh the negatives. Most of the complaints surrounding this title stem from the repetitive nature of the time loop and the fact that the game is hard. My response to the second complaint is that it's about time we had a hard RPG for PS2, and that the game's difficulty is mitigated by the very existence of the ever-so-annoying time loop. If you die, the next week starts. Yes, you lose money and items, but the monsters on the island drop tons of dough and you can always get the items again (they even re-appear in the exact same places you found them before). At least dying doesn't take away experience a la Diablo II or Everquest. And you never forget moves or lose weapon upgrades. Furthermore, once you recruit a certain character the game provides you with a time vault that lets you stockpile a limited number of items and all the money you can find. I will say this though: without a guide of some sort, it's almost impossible to get things done. This is a convoluted game. I get the impression that the US got a dumbed down version of the game, which is funny considering how hard we seem to think it is. My overall conclusion: a good RPG with a great storyline and (FINALLY!) an interesting battle system. It starts out a little slow, but if you make past week one this game is a gem. Accept a challenge and pick this game up.	1
GOOD I'm the first to actully write a review here. unfortinly I do not have THIS version yet but ... it's chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV two of the best games ever made. and you can have all these new RPG's, But Chrono Trigger still beats them all. All I can say is get this game. The loading time might kill like in Final Fantasy Anthology but I really didn't have much of a loading time with FFA as many people said they did. This is a Must buy I think.	1
I go tell you what made me buy a type of bomberman. Blast your way thruogth levels by destroying your opponents with STRATEGICALLY place bombs .That rigth there made me buy bomberman online for dreamcast. This not as good as that vison but is still great and fun	1
this game rocks! the karbons are cool! my favorite karbon is twin dragon.bomberman has to save max.  the only thing i don't like about it is that in quest mode you cant have a diffreint color bomberman suit like the ones in battle mode but the game still rocks!	1
I think that this is the best bomberman created to this date. Mostly because of the slight twist of and RPG genre inside. I also like it's many new features such as Karabons and all of the new items. This was my first bomberman game,and it was a great introduction into the series! I would reccomend this game to non-BM fans and BM fans.	1
Another excellent GBA title, this game's "Quest Mode" is, while simple, very entertaining and engaging.  The Multiplayer Mode (which is the mainstay of any Bomberman game) is a lot of fun, especially with other people (although the computer opponents are quite entertaining as well). Altogether, very high replayability, and good for a "quick game".  One of the better GBA titles out there right now, I recommend this as one of the initial titles purchased for your GBA, only really surpassed by Advance Wars.  Regardless, it's a very welcome addition to any game library, and doesn't sit on a shelf (or in a bag) for very long.	1
It'll make a good gift being brand new!	1
nice to still get this as "new"	1
Reproduction not original. Poor quality garbage.	-1
Time travel, fantastical adventurous princesses, apocalyptic futures, that is just some of the beauty of the jrpg chrono trigger. A adventure of time and space. You go through many eras seeing how they connect and change another. You gather up characters of different times with similar fates and reflections. the lush backgrounds and style is very creative and aesthetic.  The music is amazing. From the ambient sound of the guardia forest to the classical organ in the cathedral, it resonates fantasy, science fiction and orchestra wonder beautifully. one of my favorite sts. In battle, you have tech points. they allow you to use special attacks. You can combine them with others techs too. the attacks and magic are great for super nintendo standards. it has a new game plus where you start over with everything you earned from the last game.  Plus it comes with final fantasy four. on of my favorite games of all time. this game is one of my biggest influences and soul touching experiences. Play it forever.	1
Bomberman Tournament stands out as one of the best Gameboy Advance games yet. The story begins as Bomberman Max (one of bomberman's friends) goes to check out a planet that needs help. Meteors have crashed on the planet and Max checks out a weird fortress there but sadly Max hasn't come back and Bomberman is sent out to find Max. And so you begin the game with our explosive hero Bomberman. The quest mode is a big adventure that includes puzzles,battles,and exploring new lands. Also you get to collect these pokemon type creatures called Kabarons. These Kabarons can be found throughout towns and dungeons and you can battle your kabarons in local towns too. No need to capture them like in pokemon games because they are all willing to be your friend. The kabarons are mainly there to help bomberman and be his sidekicks instead of battling and trying to collect more so people who don't like pokemon can enjoy this. Bomberman also collects items and has to explore new levels and do favors for townspeople and kabaron. The quest mode is sure to keep your busy until you find Bomberman Max and save Bomberman's world. But who says the fun stops there? The battle mode which is one of the best multiplayer modes for the Gameboy Advance is loads of fun. Link up four GBAs and have yourself a battle with four other Bombers and see who is the last standing bomber. There are different levels to battle on too so you'll never get bored. If your bored and want a good Gameboy Advance Adventure,Puzzle,and Action game your sure to love this!	1
I don't reccommend this game to littler kids, but it has a really fun and interesting plot and gameplay. The graphics do use alot of the GBA and the loading isn't bad, Even if there is only one cartridge for four people. This is not my first choice but I am definetly glad of getting it for my collection.	1
my kids loved it	1
FF4 is a great game, even if this version is a bit dated.  My only real complaints are that:  1. Saving takes FOREVER. 2. I'm still baffled why they decided not to include 3 here instead of Chrono Trigger.  Chrono Trigger is easily my favorite JRPG of all time, don't get me wrong.  It just seems odd that they didn't use these PS1 collections as a chance to finally bring 3 to the US.  It just seems really out of place to have a non-FF game included in a FF collection disk.	1
Great buy	1
I pretty much bought this for Chrono Trigger itself, as it is one of the best games of all time, and would be worth the $20 by itself. FFIV is a great game as well, although I haven't really played too far into it. OF NOTE, is that these discs will be silver as opposed to the traditional black discs PS1 is known for. I have researched it and can verify the silver discs are 100% legit. They were released directly from SquareEnix, and I don't believe black CDs were even being made anymore. This is a must-have game for any PS1 collection!	1
2 of the best games of all time.	1
Glad to have this in my collection.	1
I don't know how you can still buy these new but its awesome!	1
Two of my favorite games of all times, still play them on my PS3	1
Great	1
The collection is of course bought for mostly chrono trigger and not much else and while the game works and is generally an okay port it suffers from load times and thats pretty much the only problem with it but one extra thing, the GREATEST HITS edition was supposed to come with silver back discs due to a fairly late reprint (at least thats what the internet tells me) but to my surprise my game, sealed game came with black backed discs with the squareENIX licencing instead of the original squareSOFT but since the game was made when it was squaresoft, when the game boots up it will say squaresoft as i believe it should be. Other than that strange occurance everything else is fine.	1
I Love this Game so much!	1
I bought this as a gift for my husband who played this game as a child. Personally, I do not care for it much, but he loves it. I know he will enjoy seeing our son play it when he is older.	1
Arrived fast and safe.	1
works great	1
Got for my son.	1
I recommend this for any Final Fantasy fan	1
I Love The Two 16 Bit RPGs In One Double Cd Case!	1
Nostalgic.	1
Playing Chronotrigger is impossible. There is a 5-10 seconds delay between going into menus, and going into and out of battle	-1
Classic and great game.	1
awesome!	1
Arrived on time.  Grandkids love playing	1
A game captured in essence and in perfect condition!  Thank you!	1
I love it ^_^	1
i love it. thanks	1
It's been a decade since my order.  Game still works	1
2 great games for the price of one.	1
thank you	1
I got this for my brother many, many moons ago.  He's an adult now.  FFIV was one of the awesomest FFs in the series if not THE awesomest.  Square even made a Complete Collection for the PSP with new aftermath story.  I'm still working on it.  Chrono Trigger... ah Chrono Trigger.  So many good memories!  Great graphics and music for the time!  And awesome story.  I still play it sometimes to this day but is a very long one so hard to get to the end.  It's awesome though.  Never played it?  A definite must if you like RPGs.	1
Bought it for Chrono Trigger.	1
Two of the great rpgs of all time.	1
Chrono Trigger is one of my favorite games of all time. If you are looking to begin playing classic role playing games then pick this up immediately. There are slow loading times between menus and combat, but if this is your only option to play through Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger then go a head. I owned this on release day back when I was 15 years old. The best version of Chrono Trigger would have to be the Nintendo DS for the added content and faster load speeds. There are also cutscenes in both versions. This version of Chrono Trigger was released in Japan as a single version of the game, but it made its way over to North America in the form of "Final Fantasy Chronicles". The only version of the game that does not include the cutscenes is the Super Nintendo version.	1
Bought as a gift for a diehard FF player.	1
Thanks	1
If you're looking for the classics and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for the SNES copy or deal with an emulator..this is it.	1
Good	1
love like new it was new tu tu tu	1
Two great games for a low price	1
Excellent games and I don't think much has to be said about them. If you're reading this you are likely familiar with the SNES or other iterations. This version does have load times though, and my copy came with a crack in the jewel case.	1
Great games looking forever for these out in the open but i guess most people are holding on to them glad to get them brand new tho i know its taboo i opened them it felt great having brand new disc to play again its been awhile since i had a truly new ps1 game	1
This item arrived in good shape and in good time. I haven't played it yet, but am very excited to try the two games out, especially Chrono Trigger which I have heard so much about!	1
This game shines on Chrono Trigger, not so much Final Fantasy IV. Chrono Trigger is agreed by many classic gamers to be the greatest RPG of all time to stand the test of time. These are the same group that consider Earthbound, Super Mario RPG, Secret of Mana, and other similar games to be of equal quality. Chrono Trigger is a game of time travel where the story unravels very well as you play, learning more of Lavos, the creature from space that crashed into Earth in the Prehistoric time, then lay dormant until The Day of Lavos in the year 1999. At this point, it became clear who the enemy was. Your party learns of the end of the world in the year 2300 seeing an old recording of this terrible day. Lavos nearly wiped out all life on Earth. As you play, you become connected with all the characters like you are really part of the party, not just controlling them. A game this epic is best played on the Super Nintendo, not the Playstation where you have to sit through painful load times. As for Final Fantasy IV, I suggest playing this on the Super Nintendo as well, but the game would be in Japanese. I have never been a fan of Final Fantasy, I just happen to own Final Fantasy 1-6 Japanese versions with zero intention of getting 7 or anything above. These were the glory days of Final Fantasy where it was a simple RPG with a simple plot, easy to follow story. The only reason why this game gets a 4 out of 5 is because the Playstation is a terrible game system to play any RPG because anytime you do anything, you have to wait at least 5 seconds for the pause menu, or even 10 seconds for a battle to load. These games are also available on Nintendo DS, but Chrono Trigger was changed in some points and the additional sidequests seemed like chores than actual entertainment minus the final battle versus the Dream Devourer.	1
First off Final Fantasy IV is a game with a lot of potential, if it had been made three or four years later it could've been a great game. But this game overestimates the 16 bit SNES in significant ways. Mostly the bag of characters that all get thrown out almost  as soon as you name them. Its a pretty atrocious story, and the gameplay gets a little rigid at times. has historic value for the Final Fantasy series, but i only recommend it for hard core fans.  CHRONO TRIGGER on the other hand is one of those games its near impossible to find a single flaw with, its so perfect. I have many personal feelings for this game too. just see for yourself, its an unforgettable experience.	1
Chrono Trigger: A group of time traveling heroes take part in convoluted quests to save the day. Because they're heroes. This game kept me busy with its quests and plots. The characters had character and while I didn't care for some (Marle, Magus), those I did care for (Frog, Robo) warmed my heart when they were affected by the story.  There's a lot of back-and-forth in this game; not as much as the horrendous Final Fantasy II, but sometimes I felt that there was some filler that wasn't needed. Despite all the tedious main and sidequests, the story kept things entertaining. The graphics, though dated, were lively and cartoonish. The music was forgettable save for a few tunes. While this might be a bad thing, it's not because the music gelled with the visuals to make for a seamless thrill.  Once one beats the game, they can start over with all the items and skills they picked up in their previous game. This makes the hunt for the alternate endings easier and adds to the replayability of the game.  While more helpful that recent RPG's I've played, this game still requires a walkthrough to accomplish certain tasks, especially the sidequests. I have fun following walkthroughs, but for once I want a straight-forward game without any convolutions.  Final Fantasy IV: Like the first Final Fantasy game, this was fun. The characters had character and the plot twists and turns kept coming. The gameplay was exciting and allowed for no timewasting, which heightened the tension and drama.  While an engaging experience, this game starts to lag and lose focus near the end at the final plot twist of sorts. The quest for the crystals turns into something else that isn't as interesting as the initial purpose.  Also Kain has as many heel turns as Lex Luger. Really?  As with the first Final Fantasy, and even the second, playing without a walkthrough is almost impossible, especially when it comes to defeating certain enemies. This is really the only terrible thing about his game and its not that big of an issue. My wife and I enjoyed playing with the walkthrough and actually preferred it that way.  Overall, an awesome duo of rpg classics!	1
If you like early RPG's this one's for you. If you have played Chrono Cross this one show where it all started.	1
This is a great buy for fans of both the Final Fantasy Series and the Chrono Games. It contains two games in one release.  Although the graphics for these games have been improved upon a little bit do not expect modern graphics by any means.  Final Fantasy IV: This was first released in the US as Final Fantasy II for the SNES.  Final Fantasy IV boasted great graphics for its time and a good involving story. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for nostalgia or a good traditional RPG.  Chrono Trigger: Chrono Trigger was first released for the SNES in 1995.  Chrono Trigger boasts a great story with likeable characters and multiple endings.  Because there are several playable characters and multiple endings in this game there is a high replay value. I would recommend this game to anyone into time-travel stories, fantasy, sci-fi and RPGs.	1
really how could anybody give this less than a 5 star rating? the only drawback is the load times are terr-able and games are best played on their original system or origin....but ok you lascivious critics go pay 100$ for both of these on the snes then change your batttery so your game can save properly	1
I got it because I wanted to help complete my colletion of Final Fantasy games and keep it on as few platforms as possible. Crono Trigger was just a bonus for me. The port could have been better, but I got what I wanted.	1
I'm currently a big collector of FF games.  Firstly, this game is a must have for any collector. A FF collection without this game is no collection at all! I had to order three of them in the long run. I started off, ordering myself one and my brother one. The first time, he never got his FFC. I was disappointed with this. I got it instead, so I ended up with two of them. The third order, my brother got his FFC. It delivered fast, everything was in good condition -- and I'm pleased to have it for my collection.	1
I was so happy when this came out because while I love FF I love me some Chrono Trigger! Fun game with hours of game play and replay value. When my SNES died I had to resort to other means of playing my Chrono trigger which shall not be discussed here but fROM the date that I picked this up I have been a happy clam. The music is awesome but I already bought the CD of the music alone but its great to have the game on cd platform.	1
I played Chrono Trigger when I was a kid, loved it very much, another one of my favorites. Great game	1
Just amazed than you can still find shrink-wrapped ps1 games in this day and age. Works perfectly in my ps3, but i have an old fat model so all ps games work fine. Solid shipping.	1
the loading screens kinda get long and old but if you are into the old school games this one is for you.	1
Final Fantasy Chronicles is a pretty good port for both Final Fantasy IV (released as II here in the US) and Chrono Trigger (Not really a FF game, but it still counts in my books). If you haven't played this games on the SNES which they were originally made for, this is a good as chance as any to play them now. Both games still play and feel the  same on the PS1 but with some added cutscenes. Although this games load much slower on PS1 than they did before, so it makes it a tad bit harder to play. But what's the rush? This games are awesome!  Final Fantasy IV is one of the best FF games ever made. It was the first FF game that was more character and story involved than it previous games. All the characters were great and fun. Cecil might be my favorite FF hero ever, because he goes through a major change in character from a relucant hero to a powerful leader. The story completely follows him and it works. Other fantasic characters that I can name inclued Kain the Dragoon, Rydia the Summoner, Edge the young Ninja, and Tellah the wise sage. But the game play is also really good. If you played other FF games up to FFX, then you know what to expect out of the gameplay. Instead of having only 3 or 4 people in a group, you can now have 5! Each character has their own class that makes them useful in some ways, such as some can use magic while others can use swords. Although the random monster encounters can get tiresome since you travel in very big places. The random encounters can even happen just a minute after an eariler enconter which annoyed me a bit. But that's the only real problem I have. The PS1 version of this game adds in cutscenes both in the intro and the end of the game. While I like the fact they did this, the cutscenes look pretty bad and outdated. But it doesn't bother me because you'll be playing the game more than watching a cutscene.  Chrono Trigger is a fantasic game. It will always be one of my favorite games ever! The story about time travel is very fun and interesting. The characters are great from Lucca to Frog to Mangus! The gameplay is very addicting and fun. It beats any of Final Fantasy's turn based battle because it's more fast paced and has more team work with the characters. I loved going to different eras like the Stone Age to the Ruined Future. The game also offers different paths to take which affects the endings, in turn gives it more replay value. It was also one of the first games to offer "New Game +" which allows to start a new game but you keep everything you found in the last playthrough. The PS1 port is still very fun as it was on SNES, but it suffers from slow load times. It can kill the paceing of the game a bit because it can take while to load up certain situations like battles. But it's pretty easy to forgive. This port also adds cutscenes in this game like most PS1 FF games do. Unlike FFIV which looked bad, CT looks really great with it's anime cutscenes. Dragonball Creator Akira Toriyama's work really get to shine here as the cutscenes are livly and colorful. They even use the same sound FX from Dragonball Z which is a nice connection.  Overall, while the PS1 port isn't the very best port for this games, it's a heck of alot better than never playing this games at all. Of course with today, this games have been remade more & more. FFIV has been remade for the GBA, Nintendo DS and PSP while this version is ported to PSN. CT had been greatly remade for Nintendo DS and is also on PSN now. But at the time, this was the only way to play this games if you didn't have them on SNES already. This was how I first played them because I didn't own a SNES until 2006. This games should never be ignored regardless of what system they are on.	1
easily two of the best RPGs ever made, in one package. what more could you want? chrono trigger will forever be my favorite game of all time and FF4 is definitely one of the best final fantasy games. its not my favorite one but thats not to say the game isn't a masterpiece. everyone owes it to themselves to play these two games. they are flawless, with epic soundtracks, great stories, fun characters and timeless graphics.	1
I'll try to be brief on this review because I'm a hardcore fan of Chrono Trigger (In my opinion, one of the best games ever released) and I like Final Fantasy IV a lot (PS1 version and the new PSP remake too) so I can get carried away easily and type a "book of review" :D  First of all, in case you're wondering: the two games come in this package. 2 discs.  Well, let's start with Final Fantasy IV:  The game itself is very old... 199x and all but it's fun regardless of the age, the graphics may be old but that adds to the feeling and the experience of playing a classic game (and this one you can play on a PS3, though the graphics won't be so cool) The story starts with Cecil, a Dark Knight and Kain, a Dragoon and Rosa, who loves Cecil, and he loves her too, but there's Kain who likes her as well :/ After a while (and after the 1st(and tricky) boss) you'll find a girl in  a village you've just destroyed (King's orders, right?) Cecil at first tried to refuse the King's order to destroy the village but after destroying it and seeing a little girl (who just got her mother killed by you...) crying he decides to take her away from the flames... then she engages in a fight with you and the fight is literally ground-breaking, but you can't do much since it's scripted...) after you take that girl away you're hunted as a traitor, after this part the game really begins, and after you defend the girl from the soldiers of your own nation she starts to trust you and you can fight with her (she starts at level 1, that's bad but you can level her up easily (NOW... since she has magical talents (summoner with magic) she'll require more EXP to level up than you(Cecil) at a later time) after leveling her up you'll meet a sage (who won't know so many spells but whatever...) and then after some more things that happen in the game you(Cecil) try to atone for your sins by becoming a paladin... since your dark sword won't do a thing against the evil that is hidden behind everything happening to the planet and then, after becoming a paladin the harder bosses start to appear... but that's another story :D  Notes about the game: *There's no New Game+ thing in the end... so you'll just be pleased to beat it once. *You won't need an Adamant Armor... it's the best in the game, but the effort to get a pink tail... I really think you'll be at level 99 in all your chars and have the maximum gil amount before getting one (and at level 70 the final boss can be a noob for you since you're powerful and your mages have learned all the spells in the game...) *There are hidden summons but they aren't worth the effort, unless you want to complete 100% of the game... *There are some chests with very good items... and monsters in it too... so after some play time (after you come back to Baron, to be precise) save before opening chests... some chest monsters are a pain to defeat...  Chrono Trigger  Like I said, it's one of the best games ever made (it's out on PSN, but if you don't like the download restrictions of PSN,or if you don't have a PS3/PSP, buy it in disc, it's not expensive :D)  The game starts with Crono, a young kid... wait, the game is just too awesome to start from that part! There's a long intro trailer with Akira Toriyama art, and many other trailers with his art too, so don't worry if the trailers look like a DBZ anime... it's just that it's the same guy behind both. That said, the game starts with Crono, a young kid living his life, while leaving his cat to die from starvation (there's no cat food in his room :D), and you're in year 1000 AD, since you're in year 1000 there's a millenium fair! (if you wish to train a little alone, go to the forest before the castle) But before going to the fair, don't forget to talk to your mom... you'll receive your allowance and that's some nice money, right? After going to the fair you'll find a lot of ways to have fun( and maybe get rich) if you do the minigames correctly you can earn Silver Points, which can be traded for Gil. (or spent for something else at a later time). You'll also find the Weaponsmith Melchior, he has fine weapons but you simply won't be able to afford the Lode Sword of your dreams :D after rolling around the 1st screen of the fair, you'll climb the stairs and tumble with a blonde girl named Marle (or whatever you want to call her, you can change names...) she'll be looking for her pendant...  you'll see it, GET IT BACK TO HER AND DO NOT MAKE ANY JOKES ABOUT IT. <- that's important. very important.  while she's with you, you can fight Gato, a robot who gives you 15 silver points per victory or go to the castle forest to level up with her and get a dual tech (that's a cool thing of the game: dual and triple techs! since you can only have 3 members in a party, you can have more types of attacks as you're learning techs.) After you're bored you can talk to a guy in the fountain at the fair and he'll tell you that Lucca is ready to show her invention(but before going to see Lucca, Marle will want some candy and you'd better not try to move until she's had enough or else you'll suffer in the future. try not to talk with people on the 2nd floor of the fair and do not steal the guy's food...  Lucca is a friend of Crono, you can edit her name too if you wish) Crono gives a demonstration of her Telepod device... it just teleports you to the other side... meh. but when Marle tries it... her pendant glows and she's warped in a mysterious gate, leaving her pendant behind... After the spectators run away in fear, Lucca starts to wonder what was that gate and where it took Marle... then Crono, the brave Crono decides to go after Marle... (there's no running away, as Lucca says "you brought her here, YOU bring her back...") then you discover you were teleported to some strange place with lots of forests, and later on you learn you just came back 400 years in time! And worse yet, there's a war between humans and mystics (usually monsters who can use magic). During the game you'll be teleported to various places, many different "times" (future, past, even pre-historic!) during these visits you'll meet some friends, some enemies, and see many things... And, as a good game of time travels, what you do in the past will change the present and the future, so keep that in mind... Also, you'll meet a very special person who's your enemy at first but who knows what will happen in the future? Chrono Trigger has a New Game+ System and 12 different endings (if I recall it correctly), note that some people say you can only unlock New Game+ if you beat the game and get the 1st ending... there's also a menu option that shows what you've unlocked with your endings... music, detailed maps with treasures (and the location of Power, Speed and Magic Tabs too!), detailed information of enemies and many more things... (just remember to save the System File in  a free block of your memory card and never overwrite it unless it's an updated System File (they will stack and keep data of your previous endings))  I think that's pretty much it... can't go into details without spoiling both games even more so if you liked the games by the images or if you're a fan of RPG games (and classics) buy them both in this package or maybe buy the PSP version of FFIV(which is better than PS1 version *hint*), and the PSN version of Chrono Trigger... it's up to you but it's definitely worth the money...	1
Me and my brother play for few times.  we keep this as our collection.  I recommend this game for other.	1
Final Fantasy IV works fine and the load times aren't a problem. However the load times for Chrono Trigger are unacceptable. It takes like 15 seconds to open the menu and start a battle once engaged. This game was made solely to make money, and you can see that in the quality of Chrono Trigger. They rushed the game and didn't even bother to check and make sure the game worked properly before sending it out. The load times made Chrono Trigger virtually unplayable. I ended up playing it on an snes instead. If I dread battles and avoid opening the menu because the load times are super long, then the experience is ruined. The same problem (though not as severe) happened with Final Fantasy Anthology. FF6 had terrible load times. Square didn't take the time to work out the kinks. Even though its been many years since the release of this game. I think square should offer refunds for anyone who bought it.	-1
One of my favorite games as a kid was Chrono Trigger. This version is just as fun as the original. Great story, great gameplay, and great sound design.  I'd never played Final Fantasy IV until I bought this pack. FFIV has become one of my favorite Final Fantasy games. The story is excellent, with good character development along the way. It's really a fun game and wish I had been able to play this game as a kid.	1
I have played these two games many times with my son and grandson.  We love them both.  I have the PS one games.  My grandson has the FF IV game for his Nintendo.  We also have all the other FF and Chrono Cross games.  If you want old-school rpg this is a good choice.	1
Old classics.  You can't go wrong.  If you like rpg then you'll like these two games.  What else can I say. I love them	1
Final Fantasy IV Hardtype (which this version of Final Fantasy IV is based off of) was known as one of the most difficult Final Fantasies... and this remake doesn't disappoint either!  For better or worse, it's also pretty difficult!  Chrono Trigger is much easier by comparison, and definitely a LOT more fun!  Both versions are faithful to the originals too, which both the nostalgic gaming crowd AND younger, curious gamers like myself will appreciate.  Definitely worth getting... even if you only plan to play Chrono Trigger.	1
I have not played Chrono Trigger for years. It is quite the game. The controls are easy to use. If you played it once long ago, do it again. I recommend it. Good buy too. Two games for the price of one. I have not started Final Fantasy IV yet. I will give it a go when I finish Chrono Trigger. Have fun.	1
Ok now these games are amazing I was reading some one star reviews lol omg there retarded they always compare ff games or rpgs to ff7 for one its not that great and for two why would you want it to be the same game I'm glad its different and the graphics on chrono trigger were way more amazing than ff7 and that's a fact chrono trigger was way before its time when you do spells your shirt and hair actually wave in the wind its really awesome so don't listen to the people that give it a one star review this game is amazing	1
Since my semi-retirement from video games, I feel like I've lost touch with some of the new games of today.  A lot has happened in my life (which is why you'll find a 2+ year gap between a couple of my reviews), and have focused on school and other things.  But I've been meaning to get this review up for a long time, and it's high time I did that.  I'll try not to go "nerdy" here, but this is my personal favorite video game, not only on the Super NES, but of all time.  I'm probably not the only one that shares this, as in a recent Nintendo Power magazine fans voted Chrono Trigger #3 most wanted game to be put on the Wii console, right behind #2's Super Mario RPG and #1's Terra-Gnigma.  And it's also coming to Nintendo DS.  Chrono Trigger follows the tale of time traveling adventurers.  Marle, the princess of Guardia, is whisked through time accidently by Lucca's transporter and Crono (the lead character who rarely speaks) decides to go and save her, which leads to a series of time altering events, new characters, and the ultimate final battle with Lavos.  Lavos is the main villain, a parasitic life form that's been on the planet since the stone age and used the world's resources to allow mankind to evolve, thus empowering Lavos for millenia until 1999 A.D., when Lavos nearly wipes out the human race.  We are introduced to awesome playable characters: Frog, formerly a knight named Glenn from the middle ages; Magus, a sorceror from the dark magical age that Frog seeks revenge upon; Robo, a robot from the future and turns against the evil robots and develops his own personality (a la Data from Star Trek).  Lucca, Crono's friend, is a super smart inventor with a childhood regret.  Ayla, a prehistoric babe that seeks retribution against the Reptites in the Prehistoric Age.  And Marle, the future ruler of Guardia, and is swept up in a tale of high adventure and time.  The characters are very memorable and even if you were playing today, you'd be rooting for them during the game.  Magus is out to destroy Lavos and is very narcissistic, especially towards Frog; Frog is a young heroic knight who carries the burden of failing to save Cyrus, his hero.  Marle wants to be free despite her royal upbringing.  Lucca yearns to correct her mistake of failing to save her mother from injury.  Robo aspires to become more human and constructive, and by the end of the game, he'll be one of your favorite characters.  Ayla's warrior-like personality may have you thinking impure thoughts about a Super NES character (and she's bisexual, in the original Japanese translation, LOL)... and Crono is the main hero and rarely speaks, but his heroic nature and adventorous spirit is the drive of the story.  There are many aspects of this game to appreciate.  The intricate storyline with multiple endings might seem common now, but back then, it was practically unheard of.  There's also some dark parts in the storyline (Frog having to avenge Cyrus because Magus killed him, Lucca feeling responsible for her mother's injury, etc.) as well as downright goofy parts ("Knights of the Square Table"?  And what's with pouring soda on Toma's grave?).  The music, mostly contributed by Yasunori Mitsuda, is considered a classic SNES gem and is actually the most covered game of all time on OCRemix.org (I think it's got 87 remixes, as of this writing).  This soundtrack NEVER gets old.  I read in an interview that Mitsuda had ulcers making the score and Nobuo Uematsu and Norika Matsueda had to finish the soundtrack (only a few tracks); he loved doing the score so much that he had ulcers.  Hardcore!  Gameplay wise, it's relatively simple by today's standards.  You've three of your characters in battle and depending on your combination, the double tech and triple tech combinations are different.  I always found this to be unique, and haven't seen it utilized much in later games.  The graphics were outstanding for the time; animated in a colorful and very Toriyama-esque style, its pretty smooth for a Super Nintendo game.  The magic spells look fantastic, even in 1995 when this game first came out.  I didn't find this too harsh in difficulty growing up, and I still find it to be relatively easy.  I think this is a definite plus because if you are a young pup and want a good dosage of RPG Heaven, then this would be a GREAT place to start.  This is one of the rare games where the creators didn't want to make money off of it, nor did they want to make a turd for a quick buck.  They spent time, energy, and enthusiasm on Chrono Trigger, and honestly, I think it shows.  The storyline combined with awesome music, smooth gameplay, and emotionally-driven characters makes this a rariety.  This game leaves you with a happy feeling and a sense of accomplishment for beating it (and if you're an old school gamer like me, nostalgia as well.).  Part of the reason I also love this game was because the friendships I've attained through this game, which might seem a little silly.  But hey, it was 1996, and Chrono Trigger was caught in the "growing up" scheme of things.  Overall, I highly recommend this game, especially to the first-time gamer.  It's not too difficult and it has a lot to offer.  Now that it's coming to DS with a revamped translation (kinda like what they did with Castlevania Symphony of the Night...), it's easy to obtain.  Or you can also find it on Final Fantasy Chronicles for PlayStation.  Either way, this game is a must-buy... don't pass on the adventure of a lifetime!	1
If I had enjoyed Final Fantasy IV a bit more than I did, the review would be 5 stars.  There's nothing inherently wrong with the game, it just didn't give me the same feeling as the other classic Final Fantasies have.  Along with 6, 4 is an FF that was well made but just inexplicably unable to draw me in (the opposite of FF7, which I got into while I played but seems so shabby when I look back at it).  4 is certainly for someone, but it's not for me, you'll have to compare it against your own tastes.  Chrono Trigger, on the other hand, is a prime example of a classic RPG.  While the protagonist is silent, the other characters develop well along the storyline.  The weapon and skill system is set up to nigh-perfection; everyone has a set role, but Square manages to pull it off without making the system too limited.  The music, while a bit dated, is still rather pleasant and the graphics are vibrant compared to its contemporaries.	1
Even though that most people will overlook this game because it's a PlayStation game that's a re-release of a 16-bit game during a time when we've already moved on to the 128-bit generation, if you're an RPG fan that has yet to play either of these classics, it's a must-have title. With the multiple endings and fantastical game design and lovable characters, Chrono Trigger alone is worth the full price of admission. Add in Final Fantasy IV and you have an astonishing deal that you simply shouldn't pass up. Jody Bissoon	1
i am a big fan of squear enix what can i say if you like rpg's these to games are a window to the past of great rpgs. if you are a fan then i recamends picking up this tittle.	1
Since this is a compilation game that consists of two games I'll review them separately.  First, before that, I just want to remark that these two games were perhaps the two of the greatest RPGs to hit the SNES in America. Final Fantasy IV was marketed to the American audience as Final Fantasy 2 and Chrono Trigger is often called the best RPG ever created and has a fan base larger than many of the big hits of today.  Final Fantasy IV: ----------------------------- Final Fantasy IV (or 2 American) is definitely one of the more interesting storylines and is as exciting to play now as it was back when it was first created. The general story revolves around one man's quest to understand himself and in the process atone for his sins committed in the past.  It's different than the usual Final Fantasy's in that characters who are in your party leave and come back throughout the storyline but you never have the ability to select your own party. So one character may run off to do something and you'll quickly have him replaced by another.  It definitely removes the need to switch around characters to level them all up but when you get stuck with characters you may find goofy (cough Cid, cough) you're stuck with them until the story progresses.  The most groundbreaking thing about the story, which never really happens in RPGs these days so much was that characters in the story may die at times (as part of the story). It's just something that most stories today shy away from but playing through Final Fantasy IV I never knew if I'd lose someone in my team and it always made me cling to the story hoping for the best even when put into impossible situations in the story.  Pros: The game's major flaw was how slow your character moved. That one tiny enhancement makes a world of a difference playing. Same great story.  Cons: It still uses the old four block save system. How does this translate to the playstation saves? You have to save this gigantic file onto your memory card and then inside of that file save on one of the four saves. It just doesn't make sense why they didn't update that. It's a slow process to save as well. -----------------------------  Chrono Trigger ----------------------------- Had this game been released without any changes, it likely would have been fine as it was. Still the CG movies added to it are somewhat interesting.  The game revolves around an interesting story dealing with time travel and brings you to the edge of your morality as you understand the complex interactions between the characters. As you begin to unravel the story you instantly remember pieces of it unveiled earlier and begin to make connections, something most stories in RPGs today lack as well.  Another fun piece of the game was the multiple endings it had. This isn't like Final Fantasy X-2's good or bad ending style but a unique ending system that involved how you went about beating it and at what point in the game you were at when you beat it.  For example, one ending, if you beat it before completing one storyline, caused the world to become an imp only world where they lived like humans do. It's just a fun game all around.  Pros: Great game, I don't even need to list these, an amazing piece to add to your collection.  Cons: Nothing I can really speak to.	1
Games that were released in the Super NES' heyday have been often named some of the best games ever released. Despite dated graphics, not-as-deep storylines or interaction-heavy gameplay, people still hold these games in huge regard and not just for nostalgia value. While personally I would've put Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger in one package, we still get Final Fantasy IV instead so it doesn't really matter. I'll do each game separately.  Chrono Trigger  Story: Crono is attending the Millennium Fair in Leene Square. He encounters a young girl named Marle who has a strange pendant and she tags along. While trying out Crono's scientist friend Lucca's new invention, Marle gets sent to the year 600 A.D. Crono goes after her and soon uncovers a future that is destructive to say the least.  Graphics: Probably the best looking of the games on this package. Sprites are well-detailed, graphics are colorful and there's a certain charm among many of the different time periods. But the overworld graphics look genuinely ugly.  Sound/Music: No VA but the music by Yasonuri Mitsuda is outstanding as always. The music tends to range from eerie atmospheric music to upbeat ones and even rock. My one complaint is that at times there's sections where a piece of music would be perfect for an event but then you get in a battle and that upbeat theme kills the mood.  Gameplay: CT introduced many types of ideas including the New Game+ where you can replay the game and get a different ending depending on when in the game you beat it. Also characters get special skills in battle which you can combine with other members to create more powerful spells. Frog and Crono can combine to create a swordsman skill but combine Crono and Lucca and he can use Fire-based sword attacks and so on.  Final Fantasy IV  Story: You are Cecil of the Red Knights and are ordered to do some rather morally questionable things which gets him kicked out. He finds out that Golbez is plotting to steal the world's crystals and throw the world into chaos so it's up to you and a diverse group to save the world.  Graphics: Let's face it, these graphics now look iffy. While a lot of people can manage playing a game with visuals like these, you still look at it and notice how far along things have gotten.  Sound/Music: No VA but Final Fantasy IV is often regarded as Nobuo Uematsu's first genuine sonic masterpiece. Me? I think he started hitting his stride with VI. Don't get me wrong, IV has a lovely soundtrack but I find myself listening to VI and up's soundtracks more.  Gameplay: Like games such as IX or VI, IV has distinct job classes, offering party members with specific skills. You have Cecil with his dark attacks, Kain with dragoon jumps, summoners, monks and bards. Other than that it's fairly straightforward and familiar from levelling up to item hunting and whatnot so there's nothing new but then again IV made a lot of things new so go figure.  My one complaint out of the entire package is that CT has some annoying slowdown where there's a fair amount of delay going into battle and your menus but then again it has some nifty anime cutscenes as well as IV's FMV's so all in all, it's a good package for RPG fans.	1
This game is good although not my favorite final fantasy but i would definetely buy it if i was you.  Plus crono trigger makes it worth the buy right there!	1
Final Fantasy IV and Chronocross were great games back in the day. This import from the SNES to the Playstation is just as it was fifteen years ago. The game is still fun and intriguing.	1
These 2 games are 2 of the best Role Playing Games that have ever been made.  Chrono Trigger is easily one of the best games that the Super Nintendo ever had.  Final Fantasy IV is also a title that should be highly regarded.  Quit reading this review and go play!	1
Chrono Trigger and final fantasy II, some of the best RPGs that Squaresoft created for the Super Nes, of course the titles that gave Square the enough courage to get in the games industry again... remember Final Fantasy is the title, cause it was going to be the last title they will do as a Game Industry.  Chrono Trigger, a group of young heros start a new adventure traveling in time and recreating the history by stopping the worst evil creature time had faced, and only they could stop it... With over 10 different endings, this became a hit, one of the best video games ever in the story of SNES.  Final Fantasy II, not the best title I played, prefer Final 1 and Final 3 and Final 7 of course, but still for a RPG is one of the best games as the grandfather of RPGs...	1
The only problem with Chrono Trigger was the long delays in loading the menus (a few seconds going to and from the menus)....otherwise, one of the best RPGs I've played.	1
I liked this game. I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok. I mean it also comes with chrono trigger. if you have played chrono cross and got confused that means you never played trigger.	1
This collection isn't as bonus feature happy as Anthology was. this version of FF4 (2 in the USA at the time of the SNES/Genesis era) hasn't changed that much. the random battle loading screen is like the SNES version, the switch between field/world map to the character menu while loading is fast as hell (while sadly Chrono Trigger is slower than the 2 FF games for the Anthology collection and even slower than the other Final Fantasy games for the PSone Era (7,8,9)) Chrono Trigger has a lot of bonus features for this version. Squaresoft (at the time) put a S*** load of cinemas (mainly ending cinemas), has a list of music from the game, and other stuff. The gameplay is still the same, with the exception of what I said earlier, which is good otherwise. unlike Anthology, this collection has no bonus music CD (for those who care anyway). this is still worth owning anyway.	1
This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV).  They improved the dialogue, and added in a lot of great items.  The challenge level, however, was bumped up significantly.  The game was originally paced so you didn't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up.  A few of the bosses surprised me this time through (I've played the SNES version multiple times in my day).  The story is unchanged, however.  A must have for any FF/Classic RPG fan!  As a bonus, I finally got to play Chrono Trigger!	1
I played this game back in '91 when I was 21 watching 21 Jumpsteet.  Even the dumbed american version(of this game) was fun and at the time the only good form of entertainment.(better than 21 junkstreet with Jonny Dork and Hollie Ugglieson and that stupid werewolf show whatever lame coorprate PC bull-- show we Xr's had availible to watch back then.)  Sir Ceicel the Black Knight turned prettyboy Paladin was the talk of the day back when; even though it is knocked today. Nintendo Power had nothing but good things to say about this game and Ceicilboy(and of course you could change his name).  I only wish they would release this on GBA instead of a big consoles so I could play it in bed like the lazy() I am.  FFIII is actually a title not released at all in America and instead a faked FFIII(V? II? ???).  Altough I like Final Fantasy (I got reinterested when I got the FF Dawn of Souls for the GBA) thier is a lot of grandiosing such as space travel and modern stuff mixed in midevil settings that I think is inappropriate.  I think it should only be midevil and mystical as in FF1 and 2(Japanese 1, 2 not US 1/ 2)  Why does Cece, Rosa and company have to go to the friggen moon. cartoon Amimea is weird that way but I beveve some of the lameness is replaced  with a better plot this time around in the Japanese version for PS.  I still rate it Five before and after except for the moon crap and the machines.(which may or may not be there this time around)	1
I've noticed a couple people complain about the load times (especially during battles).  There's a quick and easy fix for PS2 owners: In the main menu under the PS1 Driver, there's a setup option for "Fast Loading".  When you turn that on, the game will load as fast as the original cartridge did.  Problem solved.  .  And now for the game: Chrono Trigger is one of, perhaps even *the best*, role-playing game ever made.  Final Fantasy 6 is my favorite in that series, but Chrono Trigger has a stronger appeal for me, personally, because of the time travel/sci-fi theme.  You and your characters travel across several thousand years (from medieval times to a distant, robotic future), in your quest to beat back the bad guys.  The battle system allows you to chain your characters together for extra-powerful attacks, which is a unique innovation.  Finally, how the game ends is never the same.  Like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, the ending varies depending upon how you play the game.  Chrono Triggers offers lots of replayability, and is a true masterpiece.  As for FF4, the game is somewhat weak.  Many call FF4 their favorite final fantasy, but I was not too impressed.  I'd put it somewhere in the middle.  It was originally designed to run on the 1980's 8-bit Nintendo, but at the last minute FF4 was upgraded to run on the just-released 16-bit Super Nintendo, and it comes across as primitive, both in graphics and story.  Not as good as what came later (FF anthology).  Bottom Line: Buy Final Fantasy 4/Chrono Trigger right now... mainly for Chrono Trigger, but also to satisfy your curiosity about FF4.  If you're like me, you'll cherish it forever.	1
I love it when companies re-release classic games on newer systems for those of us who grew up with them and like to walk down memory lane, and FF Chronicles collects 2 great games in one. I have many blissful memories of playing FF 4 (2 at the time) when I was much younger and it was newly released. My obsession with Final Fantasy started with number 1, and was established without doubt after playing 2. It is a phenomenal, albeit very dated game. The characters and storyline are among the best in FF history, and the gameplay (though straightforward) remains very fun. The graphics and sound of the game were top notch when released. The graphics remain very colorful and appealing even now, and the music is good if rather "cheap" sounding compared to modern games. I sometimes wish they would have spiffed these games up a bit (improving the instrumentation of the music, adding some bonus features, etc.), but I can also respect getting the games in their original form without alteration (except for the CG scenes, of course).  That is one area of major disappointment for me, the CG movies they added to FF 4. They exhibit the worst graphics I have ever seen on the PS1. A big disappointment, especially coming from the masters at Square. It looks like someone with no experience just threw them together at the last minute. I would rather they just not added them. Furthermore, I wish they could have maybe spliced them into the game instead of just having them at the beginning and end. That really misled me.  Still, a great, faithful remake of a wonderful game from the days of old.  I never played Chrono Trigger on the SNES, so it was a new experience for me, and I did wish once playing it that I had played it in my youth, as it is a phenomenal game that, although I enjoyed it, I would have appreciated much more when I was younger. Great graphics for the time, and about the best music I've ever heard in a video game. The story and game play really pull you in, and the world is one, like any great fictional place, where you find yourself wishing you could just become part of it.  Also, in contrast to FF 4, I really enjoyed the CG movies they added. They are in the anime style by the guy who did Dragonball Z, are spliced into the game at the appropriate parts,  and are really very good.  I am disappointed however, as many others on here have stated, that this game has painfully long load times that really decreased my enjoyment of the game. Every time you get into a battle or bring up the status screen, there is about a 3-5 second wait, which may not seem like a big deal, but believe me, it gets annoying real fast. Still, if you're patient, it is a good game.  I find myself wishing that they had released FF 3 on this compilation instead of Chrono Trigger, though. I mean, it is FF Chronicles. If they had put 3 on here, we could have had the entire FF series on the PS. As it is, 3 will likely never be available in a form I'm willing to acquire and play, and thus it will eternally remain a hole in my FF experience. If they had put FF 3 on here, maybe they could have done another 2 disc compilation with Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana. Now that would have been awesome.  Sadly, I can only give this 4 stars overall, and thats me being realistic as opposed to overly nostalgic. They are both great, classic games, and I'm glad to have them, and I did enjoy them. But, this collection is flawed in several ways that just a little bit more work from Square could have prevented, and made this truly worthy of 5 stars.	1
I played chrono trigger 10 years ago, but never finished the game. A few months ago I found out about the P S re-release. What A time trip I played through the ten years later, and it was like the game had not aged one day! Truly some of the most memroibal characters and story line of any game movie or book for that matter. Today's RPG s don't even come close in terms of game play and story. Final fantasy X is a total piece of crap compared to this gem. Immortal.	1
FFIV (Final Fantasy II in USA) and Chrono Trigger are some of the best that SquareSoft has to offer.  I do believe that both are equally good games and do have moving storylines.  FFIV have been much more harder than the original that was been released on Super Nintendo.  In my opinion, the only loading times is when you "LOAD" the game and saving as well.  Now there is an extra "MEMO" save feature included for players' convienience.  It saves just as fast as the SNES by using the Playstation hardware as a temporary save if players wish to continue playing.  Then on the final save is on the memory card which does take time and assumed that the player will shut the game off.  So loading was not such a big deal in FFIV since there are absolutely no loading DURING gameplay.  Just saving onto the memory card to save and turn off the game.  My main gripe about the game is that there are no CG during certain points of gameplay.  Just at the beginning and the end, that's all!  Chrono Trigger has been remastered very well in the playstation.  The CGs are great and the only downfall about this title is the loading times when going to menus.  It seems that Chrono Trigger has been the focus on remastering the title rather than FFIV.  FFIV only has a couple of movies, but overall, great revisted title.  Got harder, fixed tranlation on the text, more extra skills for the characters to use than the one on the SNES. Chrono Trigger has more movies than FFIV, and seem to be more well looked at by the company than FFIV in my opinion.  If anyone is complaining about the save waiting and loading times, USE THE MEMO SAVE!  Then when you are ready to turn off the game, then that's the time to save onto the memory card and go through that ONE moment of waiting time.	1
This gem is the re-issue of two old SNES games for the Playstation, Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger.  I remember my old FF II SNES cartridge very fondly, though I never had the chance to play Chrono Trigger until this reissue.  I enjoyed these classic RPG's very much - now for more detailed reviews of the games:  Final Fantasy IV was originally released as Final Fantasy II here in the USA, since Square chose not to release the NES games of Final Fantasy II and III here at that time, and they changed the numbering of the game to avoid confusion here.  The story follows the adventures of Cecil, commander of the famed Red Wings squadron of airships and a Dark Knight in the service of the King of Baron.  The King, formerly a benevolent ruler, has recently begun to exhibit changed and disturbing behavior.  When he sends Cecil and the Red Wings on a mission to assault the hapless mages of Mysidia and steal their Crystal, Cecil begins to seriously question his actions.  When he brings his concerns to the King, he is rewarded by being stripped of his command and sent to deliver a package to the nearby Village of Mist along with his friend, Kain the Dragoon.  And so the adventure begins...  Those who have mostly played the later Final Fantasies, especially VII, VIII, and X, will find the character creation system in this game to be different.  As the game progresses, you will be joined by several different characters who rotate in and out of your party, and each has his or her own unique abilities.  For example, Rosa, Cecil's lady love, is strictly a White Magic user, with a small offensive capability, whereas Cecil and Kain are strictly designed around being offensive powerhouses.  So, there is not a lot of room for character customization.  Final Fantasy IV also introduced the Active Time Battle (ATB) system to the series.  Basically, in this game, each character has a time bar that fills up according to the character's Speed stat.  When the bar fills up, the character is able to take an action.  The enemies have ATB bars also, but you can't see them. So you will need to plan your strategies carefully, but yet think fast, because while you are debating on what spell to have Rosa or Rydia cast, the enemies will continue to attack.  In addition, those who had previously played this game on the SNES will be pleasantly surprised to see that the game has been completely re-translated, resulting in a storyline that makes a little more sense and is a little easier to understand (and the infamous "Spoony Bard" line is still there).  Also, there are many more items and abilities in the game that were left out of the original SNES version.  As to Chrono Trigger, this game is not part of the Final Fantasy series, though it is from the same company that produced those games.  Many other reviewers have commented on the long loading times for this game.  I found that the load times were on the order of 5 seconds or so for most battles and menu screens.  Saving the game takes a little longer.  It didin't bother me too much, but I can see how others, particularly those who played the SNES version, could be annoyed.  Chrono Trigger follows the story of Chrono, a young man who is good friends with Lucca, the local inventor.  One day during the local town festival, they encounter a mysterious young girl named Marle.  While looking at Lucca's latest invention, Marle suddenly disappears, leaving only her pendant behind.  Chrono and Lucca follow her...  CT is different from most RPGs in that instead of traversing a large world to discover new places, this world is much smaller and the new discoveries come in the form of time travel.  There are several different eras that you will visit in the course of playing this game, ranging from the mists of prehistory to the far future.  As in FFIV, each character in the game has his or her own unique abilities, with certain characters being more "Tank" types and others leaning more towards magic use.  However, in this game, you have a little more control over who is in your party at one time.  Also, each character has certain "Tech" abilities.  Different characters can create powerful Double or Triple Tech attacks when working as a team, thus allowing for many different attacking strategies, depending on the party's composition.  Another cool thing about CT is the fact that, depending on your actions in the game, you will get one of a dozen or so different endings.  The different endings enhance the replayability of this game quite a bit.  The Chronicles version also contains several new anime cutscenes that were created by the same person who drew the Dragonball anime series.  Anyone who has ever watched any episodes of Dragonball Z will see the resemblance immediately.  Overall, this is a truly excellent game, with a lot of nice surprises and features even for those who own the original SNES cartridges.  Although the load times are noticeable, they really aren't that bad and shouldn't turn someone off this game.  Highly, highly recommended.	1
2 unbeatable SNES RPG classics from the RPG specialists, revamped and better than ever before! How an yo go wrong!	1
Now, I'm just about the biggest Final Fantasy fan around, but FF4 is just nothing compared to FF7. FF4 doesn't have anything in it that can match the horror of when AERIS DIES!!!!!!!! And man, that Chrono Trigger game.  What's the deal with that? That isn't even Final Fantasy at all, just like the FF Movie.  Chrono Trigger was incredibly boring, and I was displeased with its lack of random encounters. And it should have had cool characters, like Cloud, and Aeris, and Barret, and Wedge, and Tifa.  They were great.	-1
First off with the Chrono Trigger re-release here some of the songs and sounds on this version are not as "full" as the original SNES version but the anime sequences placed in the game not to mention the added extras make up for this. And square also released a FF that was never in the states before.  I would recommend for you to buy this however the price of this game is now exorbitant (I got my copy used for 35 bucks at a used store Im guess Im lucky) I have no idea as to why either, maybe it was released only for a short period as it seems to be the same with Anthology.  If you cant find it ANYWHERE for a price under 40 bucks then I would buy it but I would NEVER pay one of the idiots in the used section 200 for one game!	1
Chrono Trigger is one of my alltime favorite games, and having it on Playstation is heaven to me.  The extras added in, like the FMVs and the unlockables you get after getting each ending are a pleasant bonus to an already solid game. Final Fantasy 4 is also a great game.  I haven't finished it quite yet, so I can't really review it very well.  All I can say is that quite a few new skills have been added, especially to that useless bard, and the graphic are smoother. Yep, a great game to add to your Final Fantasy collection, especially if you are old enough to have played these when they first came out.	1
Following on the heels of Final Fantasy Anthology comes another collection of classic Squaresoft video games.  Final Fantasy Chronicles features two games: Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger.  When it was released on the SNES, Final Fantasy IV was known as Final Fantasy II (it was the 4th game over all, but only the second released in the United States).  In America, FFIV was the first of the series to have distinguishable characters with personality as well as having a real storyline to follow.  Chrono Trigger is arguably the best RPG ever, and is without question one of the best on the SNES.  In my mind, Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI are pretty much tied for my favorite RPG of all time.  This is the first time either game has been available on the Playstation. Final Fantasy IV: This has long been a favorite of mine.  It had a story that is still one of my favorites with characters that I feel are more memorable that most of the Playstation era Final Fantasies.  This is the Final Fantasy that I grew up with.  Spells are learned as you increase in levels, characters move in and out of your party as the story progresses.  The game has one of the great villains in Golbez.  Kain and Rydia are still two of my favorite characters.  While the game is easy, it is has been made more difficult in this PSX port.  You play as Cecil, a Dark Knight as he rebels against the King of Baron in a quest to save the Crystals of the world from Golbez.  This has a large cast of characters who will fight with you (and against you) and is simply a fun game to play.  Yes, the graphics are early SNES era, but this is an old game.  It remains a fun game. Chrono Trigger: As I said above, I view this as one of the all time great games.  The story, involving time travel and its effects, is one of the best and is fairly complex with each action changing the history of the world but then opening up new questions and conflict.  Chrono Trigger featured 16 different endings (more than 10 for sure) depending on when you decide to beat the game.  After completing the game once you can restart with "New Game +) and begin the game with all the experience levels and stats that you had when you completed the game.  You also begin with most of the weapons and armor (the only things you lose are those weapons that are important to the story, like the Masamune).  Chrono Trigger has a distinct and memorable cast of characters and this is a game begging to be played.  As with all of the PSX ports, the game is more enjoyable if played on the original system so that you don't have to deal with loading times, but the game is also much more expensive to buy for the SNES.  This is definitely worth your money.	1
Frankly I don't know why people loved FF:Anthology so much...it really wasn't that good.  I mean, FF6 was better on the SNES, minus the FMV, and FF5 wasn't that good to begin with.  This, on the other hand, features Chrono Trigger, a rather good game, and a highly enhanced version of Final Fantasy IV, the game that launched the series into the main character-based RPG series in history!  Personally, I say go with this package, definately!! Chrono Trigger is a good game, with nice SNES graphics that're almost as good as Super Mario RPG's, decent music (although no FF6, and certainly not Yasonuri Mitsuda's best...even close), a nice out-of-battle interface, and an interesting quest that takes you throughout time.  True, since I never really played this game until FF Chronicles, I may have liked it more if I actually got it in 1995 (just about the only Square game I missed between the years 1991 and 2001).  I don't agree that it's quite possibly the greatest RPG of all time (mostly because I HATED Chrono, the character, SO MUCH!!!), but it is a nice enjoyable romp, and features plot twists that were about time, yet somehow weren't stolen from either H.G.Welles or Dr. Who!  That got me at least! Now, I'm not gonna deny it, but to me, the whole point of buying this package is for FF4!  The graphics are suprememly outdated, and so is the sound quality, but that doesn't change much when it comes to this game...quite possibly the greatest FF of all time!  The music is better composed than in Chrono Trigger, the characters are almost infinitely better, the battle system and interface are very easy to use, and even if you've played though it on the SNES a thousand times, unlike Chrono Trigger, this game features something new on the PSX. Yes, it's sad, that while FFIV was greatly enhanced and a totally new experience on the PSX, Chrono Trigger remains almost completely unchanged from what I can figure out.  Behind them both are nice long storylines, and behind FFIV is also strong character content.  Chrono Trigger's is full of many choices, which even FFIV doesn't have!  The plot twists are also cool, even by today's standards, although there's no real food for thought like in FFX or either Xeno games.  While FFIV doesn't feature much more food for thought, it does tell one of the greatest RPG tales of all time by far, and still contains some of the greatest musical tracks ever written.  Nobuo Uematsu may be loosing it now, but when it comes to his middle works like this through FFVII, he was quite a head-turner.  You follow Cecil on a much more elaborate and detailed quest than that of Chrono Trigger, which is dialogue centered, but still features a great gameplay system, albeit old, and full of random battles.  The equipping interface is still larger than that of any other strictly console-RPG I've seen (in terms of weapons and armor).  I kid you not when I say that FFIV is the reason I became a film major!  It was 12 years ago I saw the light, and it still shines onto me as strong as ever! Whether the more fun and basic, yet fast-moving quest of Chrono Trigger is your type, or the more elaborate and character driven Final Fantasy IV is your type (like it is mine, as you could figure out), this game is a must have!  Two legendary games! I think they could have called this: "Final Fantasy: The Two RPG's that Wrote the Book that all RPG's Would Later Follow", except for the fact that it's way too long of a title.  Original and entertaining until the end of time, get these games, for the power of epic awaits you!	1
Final Fantasy II (or IV as it is called in Japan) was one of the best RPGs of it's time and I've just started to play it again thanks to Chronicles. Crono Trigger is also heralded as one of the best RPGs of the 90s, I've never played it but I pretty sure that I'll like it. Although FF II (IV) could show it's age when I play it now, and Crono Trigger could turn out to [stink] as well, I'll just have to wait and see.	1
Any console RPG fan should do themselves a favor and pick this up, even if it's for Chrono Trigger alone.  There are a few new things to entice gamers who already bought the SNES version, like animated sequences and a few other extras.  Both games are classics and are a great addition to any console RPG collection.	1
While Anthology was a good collection, offering two classic games with extras, the overall transfered data was horrendous, providing slowdown and lesser versions of the music. Chronicles is a direct transfer as well, but it's a HUGE improvement. You are able to play two amazing games, FFIV and Chrono Trigger. Both are equally great, but what surprised me most was the fresh approach to Chrono Trigger. Fans with the soundtrack will notice that Triggers music has been re-arranged, and though very similar to its original version, the overall effect creates a much more dramatic feeling when used. Certain songs have been improved, while others are almost identical to their original versions. IV is the same music, just without the echo effect used in SNES's II version. IV has literally slowdown while Triggers unfortunatley does. Saying that, it doesn't dampen the gameplay at all. If you don't have these two title on SNES already, get Chronicles. It's a great addition to your library!	1
With a fully redone and newly translated narrative from the original Japanese version along with slight graphic,audio,and gameplay tweaks, FFIV vividly brings to life the classic setting of the RPG series that the ninth installment revitalized last fall. Playing as Cecil, the leader of the Dark Knights, you doubt the mentions of your King and are branded a traitor. Along with a large cast of colorful characters,your next move is to stop the evil plans of Golbez as he  gains control of the 4 elemental crystals. In it 1991 SNES realease, this game was noted for its ground-breaking story, which created 3-D charaters with complex, human emotions and intense moral dilemmas that wore seamlessly into the plot. Also, the Active Time Battles (ATB) system appeared to add more urgency to the turn-based battles, and it remains at the heart of the best FF games to date. These features still stand out today, making FFIV one of the most gripping RPG's to date.	1
That is why this was released.  The fans demanded it.  Finally, their voice means something!  Final Fantasy IV was among the first games that introduced the epic storyline, though with this came the inception of melodrama.  Within the first few hours of play, there must be around five deaths/diseases/oustings/hatreds etc.  This is so obvious that it is almost funny.  However, in its time this game was one of the best.  The gameplay is solid, offering traditional active time battles and a much-improved translation over the snes version. Chrono Trigger is considered by many to be the reason to own this collection.  This game offered a unique skills system, one brilliantly flowing storyline revolving on the axis of time travel, and enough sidequests to keep a person busy for 10 hours!  Needless to say, this combination makes one of the best games ever.  Only downside to this version has to be the load times.  At least a five second wait for the menu opening makes this a chore to get into.  However, once the story draws you in, the load times become completely insignificant. A must own for first time players who have a taste for old-times.  If you choose to buy these games again, like me, the extras in Chrono Trigger (bestiary, ending checklist, CG gallery) and the revamping of Final Fantasy IV's storyline make this well worth the low asking price.	1
This is actually two old-school console RPGs in one set of packaging. Why the collection is called "Final Fantasy Chronicles" instead of "Chrono Fantasy" or something like that, I don't know, but the important point is: One of the two games included is Chrono Trigger. Chrono Trigger remains the greatest console RPG ever made. The version on this new CD compilation is identical in play to the original, but includes several animated cutscenes (done by Bird Studios, producers of Dragonball/DBZ and owned/operated by Akira Toriyama, who did the character designs for Chrono Trigger as well) which are themselves worth the price. (In point of fact, the price itself is interesting; the compilation of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 4 costs less than either of them did separately when first released.) Chrono Trigger centers around the adventures of Crono (yes, that's the correct spelling), a young man whose only apparent unusual feature is skill with a sword; otherwise, he lives a rather ordinary life, getting his allowance from his mom, taking care of his pet cat, and, as the story begins, looking forward to the Millennial Fair. At the Fair, he meets with a pretty blonde girl, Marle, who wears an interesting pendant, and who as a stranger to his town asks him if he'd be nice enough to show her around a bit. Things get strange when they visit the exhibit area of one of Crono's friends, Lucca, who's an eccentric inventor. Her invention mysteriously reacts to the presence of Marle's pendant, and Marle vanishes, leaving the glowing pendant behind. When Crono decides to follow her wherever she's gone and bring her back, he's catapulted into a time-spanning adventure which will take him from the present to 65 million years in the past, and thousands of years in the future, and eventually to confront a world-destroying monster which may, at the same time, have been responsible for the creation of Crono's own civilization. Along the way he will learn secrets of his world's history, gain new powers, and gather allies, ranging from the super-strong cavegirl Ayla to the technologically advanced machine-man Robo. Chrono Trigger's greatest claim to fame was, and is, that it boasts many possible endings, all quite different, based on what decisions you make during the game. They're not all easily predictable, either, and at least one or two are rather creepy. It's also interesting in that, after a certain point, you no longer have to keep Crono in your party (most games have a set viewpoint character that you have to keep around). It's quite possible to finish the game with *ANY* combination of available characters. Gameplay is, in my opinion, superior to that of any of the Final Fantasy games. For one thing, it avoids the "eternally wandering monster" phenomenon which makes overland travel in the FF series so damnably frustrating, while still allowing you to wander freely across the land and visit places, looking for clues, new things to buy, and new friends and allies. For another, the combat sequences are much more active than those of other RPGs of its same era, and include special techniques -- both for individuals AND ones combining the techniques of two or three characters at once. Once you beat the game, you have the option of using "new game+", which allows you to start with the same power, and most of the items, that you'd gained along the way the first time. This is useful for those trying to play through again, since it allows you to zip through combats which, the first time, took many minutes to complete. (it does, however, introduce a bit of cognitive dissonance, especially in the early parts of the game: "How the heck are they throwing ME in jail?! I have enough power to level this entire CASTLE by myself!") The soundtrack of Chrono Trigger is unbelieveably good. Somehow, through the miracle of MIDI, the original game had 3 full CDs worth of music crammed on it, and the skill with which the MIDI was composed and produced made it sound, at the time, very nearly orchestral. Even today the sound isn't bad, and the re-done, fully orchestral version is amazing. Each major character has its own theme, and they're all excellent. Chrono Trigger's soundtrack still rates as one of my absolute favorites. If you like console RPGs at all, this is one that you absolutely MUST buy, and keep enshrined somewhere.	1
Ok heers the deal, this game is really great, it has truly stood the test of time. finla fanatsy 4 was a great game with a very invovling story, and chrono trigger my favorite of the two was just awsome. the music was truly awsome and the fight scenes never really got annoying, the cinematics were very well done in both games. though graphics were slightly better in chrono trigger they weren't much to brag about but that did not hurt the game much. but ff4's graphics could've killed the game without gameplay, sure they were great back in the day but now they show their age. nonetheless i advise either getting this game or at least trying it, even if you don't like rpg's at least try it. the two great games on this collection are truly wonderful and are a must rent/buy collection. but if you are only interested in flashy graphics and couldn't care less about gameplay, music or story, well you really outta re think your rating system.	1
great deal,2 great games,great value! to much slowdown though	1
If you've had trouble tracking down Final Fantasy II and Crono Trigger for your SNES, this is the solution for you.  Or if you missed out on them, here's your chance.  These are two of the best SquareSoft titles of ALL TIME.  Any good RPG fan should play them.  The added cutscenes are nice, although it is rather difficult to see all the endings in Crono Trigger (just as it was when the game first debuted).  So take on the quests of the Dark Knight Cid and the timetraveler Crono in these two classic games.	1
"Final Fantasy IV" The first 16-bit Final Fantasy game, it's considered by many to be the best. (Personally, I preferred FFVI, but different strokes...) The graphics haven't aged particularly well in the nearly ten years since its original release, but the music still is quite well-done. Those who have played the original U.S. release, Final Fantasy II, will discover that the new version has a completely revamped translation and a ramped-up difficulty level - a definite mark in the plus column for the game. And as a bonus, it is marked by the near-absence of load times! "Chrono Trigger" One of the best games of the 16-bit gaming era, it's an enjoyable romp through time, with engaging characters and dialogue and an intriguing storyline. It's also the predecessor to the PlayStation game Chrono Cross, and a must-play to pick up all the nuances of that game. The game has aged as well as could be expected - the music and graphics sound crude in this era of polygons, FMV (full-motion-video) and synth game music that sounds like the real thing, but the quality is still evident. The story is as absorbing as ever, and the addition of the Extras mode - with added anime FMVs to link the game to Chrono Cross - makes it even better. The only real problem with Chrono Trigger is the terrible slowdown that plagues the game. If you can put up with the several-second load times for battles and menus, the game is as good as it ever was - and that's pretty darn good. If you've never played the original games, this is your chance. And if you have, take the opportunity to savor the nostalgia. And with two games for the price of one, this is definitely a collection worth buying!	1
I don't get why these remakes aren't perfect. Final fantasy IV suffers some major slowdown when you use menus in combat,and the load times before battles and switching to the sub screen in chrono trigger are absurd. That said,these are still very playable versions of two of the most important games in RPG history,and taken as such are worth buying. All the old timers will get to relive their super nes glory days while all the kids who cut their teeth on final fantasy VII might actually learn something about the genre's roots. Aside from some nice new FMV and a decidedly better translation on FFIV,though,don't expect a lot of improvements.	1
"Final Fantasy Chronicles" combines Final Fantasy IV (II in the U.S, released in 1991) and Chrono Trigger, two of the most innovative and challenging RPGs of all time. The version of Final Fantasy IV found here is the complete version of the game, with a bit more challenge and velocity than the SNES release. Skin deep, though, they are basically the same game. The original graphics are preserved, but with the added benefit of FMV movies at the beginning and end of the game. The story, dialogue, items, weapons, spells, and all that jazz remain intact. This was released as "Final Fantasy IV Hard Edition" in Japan, and as the title suggests, this game is not easy. You are looking at 60 hours MINIMUM to complete this game, 100 is more realistic. Despite all my praise of FFVI, this is what I consider to be the best game in the Final Fantasy Series. It has a deeper story, and it is far more challenging. I cannot argue that the graphics are a bit, well, dated. But who cares? A great game is still a great game. Ditto for Chrono Trigger. This is one game that I am glad they re-released. It is one of the most pleasant gaming experiences you will ever have. Unlike the Final Fantasy games, the battles happen in real time, and you can use combo attacks with certain characters. The basic elements, like leveling up and attain stronger weapons and magic, are still here. The graphics are way ahead of it's time, and fit well with other Playstation titles like "Legend of Mana" and "Breath of Fire III". This game is a pure classic. One mistake made by RPG fans (like myself) is that they do not get these games while they are readily available, and wait until they become out of print and hard to find. I urge you not to do the same. There will come a time when this game, like the FF Anthology, will demand a high price because it is extremely rare. Best to get it now while you can.	1
You can't really beat this package.  I actually bought this for Chrono Trigger alone, and I traded 4 other games for it, including Final Fantasy VII.  That was one of the best trade-ins I've ever done.  I never really cared for FFIV back on the SNES or now.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fine game, but I just never could get into it. Anyway though, I've played them both now, and despite a few minor flaws, this is still a great buy for those who like the old classics.  Since I haven't played FFIV very much, I don't really have much to say about it. But, Chrono Trigger.  I still believe that no RPG has ever been able to top this game.  It set a high point in RPGs that simply could not be duplicated.  And now, this new release of the game, with new cutscenes and some touched up music, yet still keeping the original gameplay intact, is excellent.  Now I've already written a review of the original Chrono Trigger on Amazon, so there's no need to restate all that here.  So instead, I'll just address the few flaws of the game. The only flaw that it really has is the loading times for the battles and the menu screens.  And, that is a valid complaint.  However, I don't think it warrants taking any stars off of the rating.  Consider this:  For one thing, at least the battles are not random like so many other games.  And secondly, think about what happens when you encounter enemies in, say, FFVII, FFVIII, Legend of Dragoon, or almost any other RPG of their type today:  First, for about 5 seconds, the battlefield just swirls around for no reason.  Then, it centers on the battlefield, and the enemies appear.  For about 2 more seconds, the enemies stand there performing their pre-fight motions.  Then, your characters appear and take about 3 more seconds doing their pre-fight motions, getting into their stances, stretching, swinging their weapons around, etc.  When the battle finally starts, about 10 seconds have already been wasted.  Even at their worst, the load times for Chrono Trigger are no longer than 5 seconds.  Besides, the only reason this happens at all is because the game is on a CD instead of its original cartridge. At any rate though, if you like the older Squaresoft titles (which in my opinion were far better than the ones out today), get this game.  If you were first introduced to RPGs by games like FF7 and FF8, then be careful with this one, you might not like it.	1
Any RPG fan who owned a Super Nintendo in the early '90s will no doubt recongnize the two games included in this package. Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 4 (formerly known as FF2 in the US) were two of the best role playing games released for any console system at the time.  Chrono Trigger is an RPG which combines elements of the Final Fantasy series with the character designs of Akira Toriyama (best known for his work on the Dragon Ball animated series).  Final Fantasy 4 was the very first Final Fantasy game to be released for the Super Nintendo, and introduced many features for the first time that would later become a staple of the series.  Both games are strictly 2D, and while they look very outdated by today's standards, their storyline and depth are still superior to many of the newer RPGs. The only downfall with Final Fantasy Chronicles is the loading time, especially in Chrono Trigger.  These games were originally designed to be displayed on the Super Nintendo, and the Playstation has a hard time keeping up with all of the sprite based graphics.  It also would have been nice if FF Chronicles included a soundtrack CD like the one in Final Fantasy Anthology. In any case, if you are a RPG fan, you can't afford to pass up this great deal.	1
Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV is something that a new-gen (gamers whose first RPG is FF VII or other cookie-cutter FF games)punk like me have been dying to own in the first place. Of course, i'm expecting CT ten times more than FF IV, but who cares?! You have Final Fantasy IV, previously only released in Japanese version and Chrono Trigger, the best RPG ever on par with FF VI (it is still debatable which title is better).For all you other new-gen RPGers or gamers who's wondering what's all the fuss with these "old-fashioned games",here's a quick glance of these two titles. Chrono Trigger: The prequel to the best selling Chrono Cross. Tells of a kid named Crono(what?!)and his companions travel through different time periods. The game starts off with Crono visits the Millennial Fair to see his friend,Lucca,and witness her new invention. After trying out Lucca's device,a girl who tagged along with him decides to try it out,too. And a bizarre thing happened when that girl vanished and was nowhere to be found. The cool thing about this game is NO RANDOM BATTLES,like Chrono Cross,a cool fighting system called the "Tech" systme which allows up to three characters to perform a move simultaneously(all three moves executed at one").This "Tech" system can be used to sort out different sorts of combination moves and hence,reputed to be one of the best battle systems ever created. The graphics are the best thing ever happened to the SNES console,as the background graphics has almost infinite variety of colour,refined sprites,and smooth animation. CT also has the best music by Nobou Uematsu since FF VII AND FF VI. Too bad,there is no orchestrated bonus tracks because it'll rock,like the CT theme. Final Fantasy IV:The story is about Cecil and his companions stopping an evil king from collecting 4 crystals. After reluctantly slaughtered innocent lives to get one of the crystals for the king,he questions the king's authority,and was dismissed from his battalion. In addition,he is forced to deliver a package to a town,which then,you figure it out. There is nothing revolutionary here,the same ol' random battles,turn based stuff. What could really pull casual gamers off is the graphics,which is much more eyesore than FF VI,Lunar or Phantasy Star. Heck,it even make CT looked like FF VII. The backgrounds are plain,the animation of sprite characters are pretty basic,but minus,the superb 2-D monster designs. Thankfully the translations are pretty good,unlike FF V,thus,making the game more bearable to play. However,games are not meant to be appreciated by graphics alone. CT has a great soundtrack,intriguing storyline while FF IV has cool dungeon designs, original storyline and superb translation. But,why 4 stars,you ask. I might even tone it down to three stars or worse had it been not the redeeming qualities i mentioned just now. Sad to say,the slowdown is MUCH WORSE than FF VI for CT and not-so-smooth controls. Why,Square,the loading times between dungeons are sooooooo long!!!! And it's a 16 bit for cryin' out loud!!! And would someone explain why FF IV takes TWO slots from a memory card? In conclusion; try out the games before you buy it,but if you do not have CT,that's a good jolly reason for buying FFC. It's ol' school stuff,but it will appeal even casual gamers if appreciated right. Have a nice day!	1
This game rocks because Its got two of my favorite games in one  pack. ....And Final Fantasy 4 was also one of my favorite games made by Square Soft because you got two play as a Dark Knight as the main character! And Dark Knights are Evil so I thought that was wierd, but it's an awesome game! You should Buy Chronicles NOW!....Thanks Toys R'Us!	1
Even though I am a member of the "played them already" club, these games still never fail to disappoint.  Chrono Trigger is a timeless (no pun intended) classic that will entertain you each and every time through.  And FF IV is the pioneering FF for North America, and now is probably the most challenging FF out there (the Japanese FF III is probably the toughest of all 9 Final Fantasy games). Those of you who have played the FF Anthology know how horrible the loading times were in each game - fear not.  The loading time in FF IV is non-existant.  The only parts that take a while is when you are saving and loading your game, which is expected with memory cards.  Chrono Trigger is slow at times - most notably when you start/finish a battle and access the menu screen.  Most of it is negligable in my opinion. Even if you own both original cartridges, it's worth it to play FF IV again, as it is like a completely new game, with a new translation and it's UNCENSORED!!!  That's right, what Japan got originally we now have.  Get it right now.	1
This is broken into two parts. Final Fantasy 4 is first then Chrono Trigger. Note that the combined score is 4 stars. Final Fantasy 4: The prodigal son returns some would say. This time it is the athentic Japanese version too. To those who don't know the Super Nintendo release was, shall we say, dumbed down for the Americans (since when are Americans dumb?  We are 10 and 1 after all: review history if you don't understand). Not anymore. The script is the original. No more "you spoony bard," which was much more colorful in the Japanese version. New spells, abilites, and even monsters have arrisen and have kicked the game's difficulty up several notches. As if the game wasn't hard enough to begin with. The music is still the same old 16-bit music but it still is moving. The story is very deep and contains death, betrayal, and love. This was back when Square focused more on story than on graphics and cinematics. Speaking of which the cinematics are beautiful. They do show !signs of being not as well done as some other CG movies that Square has produced. This game received 4.5 stars. Chrono Trigger: The prequel of Chrono Cross with many sad problems. The main one is the hideously evil load times. These mainly occur during the battle and non-battle mode changes. The lag time is about three seconds in many places. This slows down the game in such a way that those who played the original cartidge will quickly become antsy because things are taking longer then they are used to. The slow down also makes it hard to build levels without going mad. The slowdown also affects the anime movies. The beginning sequence is jumpy and seems to progress very oddly. The movies would have been beautifully well done if only they didn't have these problems. The music is very well done as well. Who could forget Magus's dark theme or Frog's heroic overture. They have returned, in all their Super Nintendo glory, and have been well preserved. As an added feature you can !access any of the movies, songs, and other specials after you have come across them or have completed one of the 12+ endings in the game. The story is very complex and it is hard to keep up with, especially with several time periods and many things happening at once. This usually occurs after you get to...The End of Time. Insert onimous music here. A very deep skill and tech system is the games crowning feature, and gives you the reason to fight the maddeningly slowed down battles. All in all the game received 3.5 stars. It is fairly obvious that the gem in this re-release is Final Fantasy 4. My recommendation would be to play this first.	1
PSO is a great game, my friend brought it over and it's incredibly customizable and fun to play, if you want a game to brainwash you into playing more and more and more, this is your game. However i'd advise against the version 2 very very strongly, you have to give Seganet your credit card number to play this and it costs like 24 bucks a month or something for a few extra levels. However PSO is a very very good game and you can head out today and buy PSO and a keyboard for 45 bucks and never pay a cent. It's kind of a no brainer unless you live, eat, sleep, bleed, sweat, etc... PSO.	-1
That's right to play this game online you have to pay! My friends and I being hardcore Sega fans are very disappointed. You already have to pay 40 bucks for the game. In this version there is only new items and new levels no new characters. I would recommend purchasing the first one it is very good and you don't have to pay to play online. I also recommend Sonic Adventure 2 it is way fun the best sonic game ever.	-1
new sealed great price for a classic Dreamcast game!!!	1
I'll get down to it, PSO is addicting and quite the experience. In my case, I am playing Dreamcast PSO for the first time, already being exposed to BB and NGC. compared to those two, this one is the lesser, but if you're experiencing PSO for the first time here, get ready for a great adventure.	1
v. 2 is an upgrade of the original PSO. It's basically the same as the first one except there's more rares, the introduction of Ultimate Mode, a level upgrade from 100 to 200, and also you can transfer your character from the original PSO.  The only problem is that it may be too easy to get rare items offline, along with that Ultimate mode is broken, and what I mean by that is, unless you build a Force right, it's impossible. Magic damage barely hurts the first wave....  But despite that, and for the fact that I love this game....  OVERALL:  5/5	1
great game, it was used I think because the hinge on the case was broken and the shrink wrapping job looked like it was done after the fact. But it doesn't matter! The game works perfectly and the registration code worked so I'm able to play the game, also the shipping was pretty quick, thanks =)	1
I bought this knowing that the servers would no longer be up. I figured i would just play the single player mode in the game. However you still need to link the game with your system and if you buy it used it will not come with the code needed and will be unplayable	-1
I originally played the gamecube port of this game that had both version 1 and 2 combined. It was my favorite game and I was stoked when I found out it was orginally for the dreamcast. I miss the 2 player element that the gamecube port had, but the dreamcast version has better timing and less glitches. Overall, I find both versions to be equally wonderful.	1
If you like this game you stand alone, I was angered  with this game for a few reasons.  First they kill the story of phantasy star, and it does not have the enjoyment feel of the older ones. Secondly, it just isn't fun you flay the same levels over and over again. Eat the same food over and over again and eventually you cant take it anymore. Thats how it made me feel.	-1
Phantasy Star Online (PSO) is a good game bordering on great. The game starts off with a ship called Pioneer 1 heading to a planet to migrate there because earth was no longer livable. Pioneer 1 had said that everything was A-OK so Pioneer 2 was sent off with the rest of earths population to go to Ragol (the name of this particular planet),But when P2 gets there they loose all contact with P1. This is where you come in,your character is tasked with investing the many areas of Ragol in search for survivors and any clue to as why the animals have suddenly gone aggressive. This is about the most story your going to get in one chunk with PSO the rest of it is told Via side quests and little text orbs in the main game.  PSO was meant to be an online game and it shows, Pioneer 2 is pretty empty and the NPCs never say anything different unless your on a side quest. Normally when your online this is the place where other players are supposed to be,now since there is no conventional way of getting online (Yes you can still go onto PSO online,via private servers) all the areas will feel empty and you can blatantly tell that you were not supposed to be the only one doing some of the missions.  The graphics of PSO are very nice for a Dreamcast game,imagine a stepped down version of PSU and your not to far from the mark. Gameplay is pretty fun,if your a beginner on PSO then you might want to try your character out as a Ranger first,being a Hunter or force you first time will result in you not playing PSO very long. My only complaint is that you have to do an area over an over again to get the proper level to beat the boss/later floors,because as mentioned above,you were supposed to be in a group to beat the bosses at lower levels.  Pros: +Good amount of character customization +Good Graphics +Gameplay is fairly fun +Feeding you MAG is rewarding +Can still go online  Cons: -Was meant to be online,thus levels seem kind of empty -Have to go through levels multiple times to be strong enough to beat bosses -Game just feels overall empty offline.  Overall I'd recommend this game if you like Phantasy Star games,but If you want a great offline experience with a story, go for PSU.	1
This product is more or less for old time sakes, its a little more glitchy than the newer games, but the thing about this one is you have to make more decisions because of the smaller bank size, also it seem like the monsters in the ultimate mode are tougher in this version. Still it is better than version 1 in the things you can do (the scrolling) It is still fun to play even these days.	1
This game is good.  But you should only get it for two reasons.  The first is if you are a hardcore PSO fan.  Version 2 for the Dreamcast doesn't match up at all to the Gamecube version.  And most people that have been playing the Gamecube version have transitioned to the more superior "Blue Burst" for the PC.  So this is a novelity perchase at best.  Secondly, if you are going to play this game, Sega doesn't have their Dreamcast servers up anymore.  So you'll have to find a private server to play this game online.  Yes, they are out there.  But this game simply isn't all that much fun unless you are online.  There are also some key diffrences in the Dreamcast version in comparision to the Gamecube version.  The most prominent one being that you actually drop the weapon that you have equipped if you die rather then it just merely being unequipped.  I don't think I have to tell you what that means if you're playing online.  And for those of you that are looking forward to playing all the offline quests, some of the quests that were in the Gamecube version were downloadable only in the Dreamcast version.  So you'll miss out on a few of the quests if you stay offline.  But you will have more fun with that quest where that useless RAmar, MOME, tags along with you to fight the Del Rol Le.  Unlike the Gamecube version, he doesn't  play dead and you have to protect him the entire fight.  I thought I'd mention that for those that want to try that quest out in a new light.  In summary, this is a novelity perchase for the fans and nothing more.  You can only have one character at a time in the Dreamcast version as well.  So, whatever class you pick, you're stuck with and you don't have the other 3 slots to play with.  It's also worth noting that the HUcastal, RAmarl, and FOmar aren't in this game either.  None of those classes were particularly practical anyway.  So, that's no big loss.  But if you're looking for a version of PSO that can be played online for free, this is the best thing you can get outside of getting a hacked J version of "Blue Burst" to play on a private server (which is hard as hell to find now).  The kids that say that this is the best game ever, should know better.	1
First off this game requires money because it is run on powerful t1 servers. IT IS ONLINE POWERFUL AND IT NEEDS MONEY TO RUN, SO STOP NEWBING AROUND AND PAY THE BILL, BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN"T THIS GREAT GAME WOULDN"T EXIST. Unlike games like starcraft, pso is a persistently changing online experience. You don't create games, there is one game to play on one server which costs alot of money. Besides that the game is fun for non newbies!	1
It's sad to see the Dreamcast leaving us. But it's great to know that it's leaving us in style with some of the best games. After Sega announced they would stop producing the Dreamcast, some of the best games have been released. NBA 2K2, NFL 2K2, NHL 2K2, Sonic Adventure 2, and of course Phantasy Star Online version 2. PSO version 2 is about the Pioneer being destroyed. You use your created character to go around a planet called Ragol to research what happened and it's remains, etc. The gameplay is one area that PSO version 2 really shines. You can choose to either play online or off-line (both excellent modes). If you own PSO version 1 for Dreamcast you will be able to port you character form that game into version 2. Unlike most RPG's this game is a big-time slashing, shooting and killing game and is much more fun than many RPG's. This game also has many new quests that were not in PSO version 1 as well as several new levels such as Cave and Beach to go along with Forest 1 and Forest 2. Sonic Team has also made it easier to get more useful items throughout the game. Meseta (the money in PSO) is much more plentiful and rare items are much easier to find than in PSO version 1. Also you will find more items such as weapons that can be used by your type of character. If you would rather play online it will cost you $15 for 3 months which is not at all a bad deal. Online you can play Battle Mode vs. other players around the world, play Go-Go Soccer in the lobby or join forces with others. If you own Phantasy Star Online version 1 and have yet to pick up version 2, you don't know what you're missing. With new quests, more rare items, and great, new levels, PSO version 2 is one of the best games on the Dreamcast. The DC definitely goes out in style.	1
Phantasy Star Online Version 2 is one of the last games that you will still see on the shelves. Very few stores still sell this title, because it is the successor of the huge international bestseller "Phantasy Star Online". PSOv2 is about the Pioneer being destroyed, and your customally created character must go on a planet called Ragol to research what happened to it, where are it's remains and so on. A plot taken out of the "RPG Storylines" book. It has a weak storyline, but the gameplay is incredible. This game has a online and offline game. The offline game is you can do this adventure yourself, level up your character, buy items, learn magic tricks. The online mode takes advantage of the Sega Dreamcast's build in 56k modem, or a purchasable Broadband Adapter. The modem allows you to connect to the PSO server and play with people all over the world, including Europe, Japan, South America, Africa, Australia and other places with the Internet. The second version of Phantasy Star Online has more additions to it. There is a highly wanted "Battle" mode, which lets you battle other online players. That is really cool! They also have Go-Go Soccer which lets other PSOv2 players play soccer in the lobbies. Now, the cons to PSOv2 is that I found not too much use to it. If you read the cover, you must pay a steep fee of 15 dollars for 3 months of unlimited online play, due to the new filters to eliminate Gameshark users and people who use illegal items, and the overwhelming amount of users. So you have to convert your PSOv1 file into a PSOv2 file, and there is no turning back. The only way to get free online gaming without the extras is to play with version 1. Now, I purchased a DSL modem, and I got rid of my second phone line, which I used for PSO when there was no one online. The only way my DSL modem to get online is to buy the rare, exclusive, expensive broadband modem... They discontinued it after their announcement of the ending of the Dreamcast. Now you can only buy it on [name of store] for ridiculously high prices. I found no use for it, because I refuse to pay [dollor amount] to the additional [dollar amount] for hte game. You have to pay [dollar amount]to own the game and play online for a year. Phantasy Star Online is an excellent expierence that must be had by any Sega fan. I recommend also playing "Sega Smash Pack" which includes "Phantasy Star 2" from Sega Genesis. I would recommend Phantasy Star Online Version 1 so you can get the expierence of free online play, at a excellent affordable price. You cannot find it in stores, but you have to look around online for it.	1
This game... is the best RPG game EVER!!!!! TO tell the truth... This gae is real real good. I heard the news that this game came out in PC VERSION(!?) in Asia. I have the PC version and it's so good. The good thing about this game is that you can travel through world, OR Play Online. (Exactly, playing online is much fun> but still even if you play alone THIS Game rules. This game has been permitted to be selled over all nations. It was been proved that the game itself was REALLY GOOD> If you have played Final Fantasy, You'll know the difference. In this game you can go up to LV 200!!!! When you play in online, you can battle with your friends, travel, OR do the Challenge Mode.*you'll know what I'm talkin when ya play the game. Also, I read another review about this game. The reviewer WAS Unsatisfied about the Online game because you had to pay. But WHAT SO WRONG ABOUT PAYING 15 DOLLARS FOR 3 MONTH? ALSO! This game...'s graphic ... is so... COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL! Buy this game , you won't regret it.	1
This game rocks. It is one cent more than the other one also(at least on amazon). But you get a lot more than number 1. New weopens, new features, new almost everything. and on top of all that.... PSO Version 1!!!! Stop complianing about the price of 15 dollars for three months.	1
although almost unknown to the public, klonoa was one of the best platformers on the PSone and klonoa 2 carries the torch.  The overall feel, looks, controls, ect... of the game are great.  just as in klonoa 1 you get to manipulate your enemies with a magic ring, but this time around there are allot more ways to take advantage of your enemies.  the only drawback to klonoa 2 is that it is too short. some say it is too easy but that doesnt really take away from the experiance in a platformer.  go out and get this game now!	1
nice!	1
k	1
This is a great platformer, and one the best hidden gems in the Playstation 2 generation that seems to have fallen by the wayside.  I have no idea why this game wasn't more popular when it launched, but I consider it one my favorite games of all time.  Those who are familiar with the Klonoa franchise know that it is a simple platformer a la Super Mario Brother with a cute cel-shaded art style and whimsical characters.  Klonoa 2 is appropriate for gamers of all ages--including adults--and there's plenty of game there for everyone.  Whether you're simply along for the relaxing ride, or you want to get a perfect score on every level, Klonoa has plenty of meat on its bones.  If you can find a copy for a decent price be sure to grab it; you won't regret it.	1
This was one of the best games ever, got this and Klonoa 1 on wii for christmas. Had to try this one though. Highly recommend this game.	1
An incredibly fun game. So easy to pick up and play through whenever you want.  The game is very intuitive which adds to the lack of difficulty. Could use harder puzzles to offset the simple controls. Also the game is VERY short. Can be beat in as little as an hour (maybe less).  There are a few items to collect throughout the levels, but they are easy to grab and do not add much to the game.  In short, fun game.	1
A great addition to the Klonoa franchise from NAMCO. Like my other review: A good story, longer than the first game Difficulty ramps up at the end, matching the first game Graphic style is nice, but doesn't push the envelope Replay value is medium, unlockable stuff is harder to get than first game The irresistable charm continues  Overall rating: 7/10 Another excellent game for the series CAUTION: There are issues with this game and PS3 backwards compatibility. These are minor but can affect gameplay. Reply to this review and I'll tell you what I know.	1
You know how middle schoolers get to be annoying? Mostly because they start trying to act grown-up by swearing and saying perverted stuff? Well, those lamers wouldn't enjoy this game.  Instead, give this to your innocent 12 year old who would never say anything derogatory. Their eyes will light up with stars once they play it - the game's characters are cute, the platforming is awesome fun, and the difficulty is ideal for younger kiddies.  *** note that certain adults may have an unusual affinity for this game as well. when such a scenario arises, buy them a used copy immediately - you may otherwise find said adult stealing turns from your child in order to get some playtime.	1
This is what a platformer is meant to be!  Think part Kerby, part Sonic, and throw in a healthy dose of its own unique flair.  The only small complaint I have is that there is no way to skip through the stupid text in the story cutscenes... still, this generally does not waste too much time and so it is only a small complaint.	1
That was my first thought when I saw this cuddly little guy in the video store. I rented it and when it was due back, I was into it, so I bought it. Some parts can confuse you while you're staring right at the obvious, you get to surf on a log, and did I mention the cuteness? Of course you get to collect things and you don't get past every area or boss without a little thought, admiration at the scenery, going back for something, and a fatality or two trying to reach those nasty collectables. When the game is "over", your quest continues in collecting. I wish the Klonoa (1) before this wasn't so rare, and I would really like a third one with some more platform roamability.  Definitly get this. You can replay the levels over again without starting over.	1
I have to be honest I hate childish games,they are so annoying and sometimes too cute for me. But this game is some what fun there is nothing really to unlock just to play the game and finish it. I only play it because I am just so damn bored. This game is only good for girls or boys that are below the age of 11, well that is what I think I really don't care if you buy it or not I am just saying think twice before u waste your money you might regret it later on. It's an alright game.	-1
This game rocks! I used to think that Madden 2002 was the best football game out there. This game really brings you into the college football expeirence. All of the different things you can earn while playing the game makes it a sports game that you can really enjoy even after the season ends. I can't wait for the net version of this game. Go get this game if you like sports at all, it will be worth the money.	1
This game really rocks. I rented this tonight and loved it. Klonoa is so cool in this and the graphics are cool to. I also like the enemys. Right now im in the amunsment park stage 5. Klonoa has a very awsome super jump. This is so great your entire family to enjoy. Woo Woo! Yippie! all right! Toataly awsome dude!	1
This game is so pretty.  The settings and game play are super creative.  It's a dream game for youngsters.  Klonoa does speak in Japanese however, as it is a Japanese game,  (They do translate it).  If you're nosy and like to know what people are saying at all times this might annoy you.	1
There seem to be a lot of people out there who have never heard of the Klonoa series. I feel sorry for them because these are some of the funnest games ever made. For the most part, this is a 2-D platform game set in a 3-D world. I say "for the most part" because every once in awhile you come across a  3-D level. The controls are incredibly simple. You use the control pad to move, the X button to jump, and the circle or square button to shoot an air pellet. There is a good variety of different types of levels, but most of them involve puzzle-solving with the gameplay. You have to figure out how to use the enemies in the level to reach the next part of the level. There are also a few levels where you use a snowboard/wakeboard/hoverboard. Then there are five boss levels, I believe. The graphics of Klonoa are very bright and colorful and you will never have any slowdown. Unfortunately,this game is so underappreciated that you will be lucky to even find a copy anywhere. If you can, though, give it a chance. You will get hooked.	1
Number one, college sports are magnificent, and with that, i might add, you have a very realistic gameplay. But in some cases, i might also add, some passes aren't realistic at all. I mean, have you ever seen Norfolk college score a touchdown with a 50 yard pass? or have you ever seen Yale university and also Georgia tech score a field goal kick in the 50th yard line? Well i haven't, nor other people have. Well, what about the fact florida a & m have actually made it to the rose bowl somehow. Gosh, that is weird. In fact, it is so weird that i once saw purdue in the finals. Well ok, ok, maybe other things will be realistic. I must say, i love the way kurt and lee corso argue on which side wins the match, but they tend to say the same thing over and over. And when kurt speaks highly about the home side's quarter back, you see your away side quarter back in the tv screen. Very weird! Also, when you click on 'ask lee corso' whilst you're playing offence, lee will keep on saying the same plans on and on and on again. What about this, when you're playing defense, make sure you pick the default settings defensive plan that is, 'cover 2' then when the cpu is ready to play his move, press the audible, and press the O button. Then your players will move back. And no matter what plan your oppenent does, you'll intercept the ball when ever he passes it. Weird huh? I mean, one plan can ruin your oppenent's offensive play. How about this? when you're recieving the ball, whatever recieving play you pick, the cpu will automatically make your reciever run for it. And when you plan your reciever to catch the ball on the left, he just stands in the middle. I mean, come on guys, this is the most unrealistic part of the game. The only reason i gave this game 5stars is because of the graphics and one more thing, in my campus challenge task list, there's a task for you to make a field goal kick for more than 50 yards, how on earth can i make it? obviously pathetic.	1
I bought this instead of Madden because I like college football much more then professional. The quality is equal to Madden 2002, so it's just your choice if like NFL or NCAA more. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that they don't load the players names. They have the numbers correct, but I am a Wolverine fan, so the back of Walker's jersey just says '#4'. If you want the names, you have to enter them yourself. That's annoying. And the Michigan football stadium is not even close to the real thing (they show polls and an upper level at one angel). I had NCAA 1999 for PS one, and they did a much better job of catching the look and feel of the teams' home fields. But the tech. quality of this is awesome.	1
If anyone said 2D platformers are dead, they certainly did not play Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil. Klonoa 2 plays like an old style 2D platformer, but the graphics are in 3D with beautifully animated cell shaded characters and backrounds. The gameplay is rather simple...use "wind bullets" to capture your enemies, then either use them as weapons or to activate switches (similar to Kirby or Mario World's Yoshi). The whole game from the music to the character design carries a distinct cutesy Japanese style, so that may turn the more casual gaming audience away unfortunately. Due to it's fairly laid back difficulty however, Klonoa 2 is a game that anyone can enjoy...and there's no blood or violence, so if you have kids it's safe material for them to play. If you like traditional style 2D platformers such as Mario and Sonic, definitely pick up Klonoa 2 now while it's still available. You won't regret adding this classic to your collection.	1
Klonoa and friends are really quite cute, and have a very fun, post-Sanrio design to them. The gameplay is geared towards a kinder, gentler, younger audience, I believe. Kids over the age of 15 might find it a bit soft, though. It's an enjoyable game, much in the same flavor as Sonic and the rest, but a bit more light-hearted. At least in the handful of levels I completed. It's very cute. But I don't really have any desire to play it through.	1
That's right.  Klonoa 2 is much better than anything Crash Bandicoot can do!  I know it looks cute but it's really a clever mix of puzzles and platform action all wraped up to make one fun game.  From the first minute you start you quest you know its something special.  I don't know about you but I thought the cel-shading was used very well and gave this game a very nice fell.  If your looking for a fun platformer then look no more.  Klonoa 2 should not be missed.	1
The first Klonoa was, in my opinion, the best platformer for the original playstation. Symphony be damned, the 2d critter set against lush 3d backdrops, featuring multiple paths and a darkly whimsical story line, delivered innovative gameplay from start to finish. While childlike in its presentation, Klonoa 2 mines the same rich vein, but breathes full 3d life into the hero. THe result is stunningly fluid animation, and dead accurate control that inspires confidence with each and every jump. The graphics have also taken a PS2 sized leap. Klonoa now vaults his way through an astonishing series of Tim Burton esque environments so huge, they could not possibly have appeared on the original PlayStation. K2 soars to such intense skyscraper sized heights that it had my hands sweating from the vertigo. Despite the wealth of eye candy, the true brilliance behind the game is the sharp level design. While it features less backtracking and twistiness than the original game, K2 presents a formidable series of reflex and timing based challenges that will keep you coming back to Klonoa 2 is that it's a bit on the easy side, and lacks the dark, melancholy mood that engulfed the first game. Hopefully Klonoa 2 does well at the box office unlike the first game, because, despite his low profile, this kitty is a prince among men.	1
Klonoa is an excellent game. The visuals are no polygon pusher, but the textures, colors, and character models give the game a disticnt happy go-lucky feel that no one can call 'bad'. The game's atmosphere is what truly sets me off on ranting about how much I love the game. The game isn't very challenging, but it remains to be endless fun. With several secret levels and many things to collect, the game doesn't get old. The control is the most simple control that has ever crossed a console, which is why it is so excellent. Any person from ages 6-50 will have a good time playing this game. It is slightly challenging of the mind, but it isn't challenging for the people that are somewhat lacking in platformer skills. There simply isn't anything bad about this game besides the fact that its 15 hours tops. But after unlocking everything and gettin the secrets in a new game, its about 25.	1
I was an avid NCAA Gamebreaker fan for PS1.  Then came the days of Madden 2001.  I have always been a little skeptical about NCAA Football from EA sports, because the PS1 games were awful.  However, NCAA 2002 takes Madden 2001 to the next level.  New features including Dynasty mode (where you can control a team for season after season) and then when you players graduate or get drafted, you can save them and import them into Madden 2002.  The gameplay is smooth and the Heisman level difficulty setting is pretty tough.  I'm really glad that EA improved the passing AI in this game, because there were a couple plays in Madden 2001 that were simply unstoppable.  If you're looking for a REALISTIC college football game, this is the game to get.  Hopefully in the future EA can get Gamebreaker's announcer Keith Jackson, because the lines for the announcers in this game get old quick.  The mascot addition is a great new feature though.  Check it out...I promise you won't be disappointed.	1
No, I'm quite serious. Why the heck did I buy this thing? The collection of titles (as of this writing) is really slim pickings. Especially for someone who's been playing games since Atari was at their height of power. So I saw the previews and figured "What the heck?" I'll pre-order the thing from Amazon. So the big day arrives and I get a small package from Amazon. Tear open the package and popped in the DVD. Hhhmm cute graphics and smooth animation. Well, I wasn't two minutes into the game when I hear a squeal from behind me. It's my girlfriend who wants to play the game. So I figured, "Hey, why not?" and handed over the controls. Well, that was a big mistake. I haven't been able to play my PS2 since. So looking over her shoulders, the game is a sort of 3D'ish side scroller. Navigation is limited to left or right motion (There are spots where this deviates from that, but it's a moot point) reminiscent of some of the later Mario or Sonic games. The game's graphics are incredibly clean and are a clue to the future power of the PS2 and it's ilk. In short this game is perfect to keep the little brat or girlfriend off of your back for a while. However, I do have some gripes about the game. The game gives the illusion that it supports two player control however, this is not true. The "second" player is nothing more than a helper for the first when the first player is in trouble. Useful for very young players but extremely boring for any one else. What I don't understand is if the developers felt that this was a necessity why is this option only available on the second controller? It should have either been all or nothing. Full control of the second character for the second player or the ability to map the control of the second character to the first controller. Not this half planned junk that Namco attempted. The story is also pretty decent but never really answers the question, "What the heck is Klonoa?" I suppose this question is actually answered in the original. Too bad Namco didn't notice that the original game is going for insane amounts of money. They could've made a quick buck by re-releasing the game. Oh well, life bites. But hey, that's what I get for buying this game. I suppose I should be able to play my PS2 as soon as my girlfriend quits playing Klonoa 2, that is of course if she doesn't discover my copy of Dark Cloud.	1
I picked up this game at the local game retailer, and I thought I would get too distracted with the two GBA games I got along with it.  But, I do know myself to make false predictions, and I had a blast playing this!  The characters (and enemies) were all done very well.  Most everything is cel shaded (3D environments with 2D characters), and I thought I wouldn't see another cel shaded game for a while after Jet Gring Radio.  The theme is pretty much Japanese Cutsie style but who cares?  I'd play a kiddie game as long as the gameplay is good!  The controls are a little bit more sophisticated than the original Sonic game (Sonic had the directional pad and a jump button) with only a Jump button and a Shoot button.  If you're a dad who wants to get some good gameplay, this is a good waste of $X...as long as your kids arn't into gaming too. If they are, you won't be playing this until they're done...with the whole game.  The only downside to this killer-app is that it took me a mere two days to finish.  But I'm still playing the thing hours at a time! In a nutshell, this is fun as hell with non-violent game play, so your wife won't yell at you for getting another "shoot-go-lucky" game for the kiddies to kidbitz on.	1
To begin, I think this game is getting over hyped.  Many of the sites are acting like this is the second coming of sonic or mario or crash.  Its not.  If you don't have high expectations you will enjoy the game much more than if it is all built up.  That said, Klonoa is a solid game and a standout in the relatively thin PS2 software crowd. Graphics: Excellent, really there is no PS2 title that looks better than this.  Keep in mind the graphics are cel shaded to look like a cartoon.  Still, if you think cartoons look good you will think this game does.  It really was a labor of love for some artist. I cant say enough. Gameplay: Ups and downs.  The game is 3-d but is played on rails like crash bandicoot.  More like a 2-d game.  This helped the programers when it came to camera angle (which can be aweful in platform games).  There have been only a couple times where I was bothered and I am just finishing off the last boss.  The actual gameplay consists of 2 buttons- jump and action.  Prmarily the action button is used to pick up enemies and use their bodies.  If you have played Mario Advance for the GBA or the Nintendo game it was based on, this is a dead ringer.  Overall it gets repititious, but is helped by some very creative level design.  There is a good incorporation of quick little puzzles into the required jump, jump, shoot formula.  There are also little bonuses to keep you playing (like time trials and max coin... er dream jewel collecting).  The bosses are different than anything we have seen so far. Sound:  This game has possibly the worst soundtrack of any PS2 game.  It is aweful. Story:  The story is also quite bad, it seems geared to a 5 year old.  except a 5 year old who is into really boring lame stories.  not good. In conclusion: The story is uninspiring, the sound is aweful, but the classic gameplay and inspired graphics will keep you coming back.  The game is relatively short (about 10-15 hours), so it might be more of a renter than a buy.  Either way, you should definitely spend some time with the game, especially if you are a fan of Klonoa's more famous counterparts - Mario, Crash, and Sonic.	1
I have been a fan of EA Sport's College football series for many years and this is, without a doubt, the best installment yet. From graphics to sound to the game engine, this is GREAT!!! The game has the usual practice, season, franchise mode, etc... I usually don't mess with any mode except Franchise, and this mode is great. You can take any team through numerous seasons in your attempt to build or maintain a dynasty. The game keeps track of stats for every player and even for you, the coach. Your rating will increase over the years as your team does so. The game play is equal to Madden 2001 (haven't played the new one yet) and this is a good thing. You can change the route's of your recievers at the line of scrimmage which is VERY cool. You can still change your pass coverage as well. I do wish they'd kept the momentum meter, but oh well. Speaking of stats, you can see both the Media Top 25 and the Coach's Top 25 Poll, as well as the BCS rankings. You have a Heisman Race and you will be able to see the All America teams. Finally you even have players of the week. If this isn't enough, some weeks you might get lucky and have TV coverage in which ESPN's team including Lee Corso will call the game! This game is the ultimate college football game. I'd give it 5 stars, but it's not quite perfect so it'll get 4.5	1
I bought this game along with Madden 2002 a little over 3 weeks ago and I'm completely addicted. First of all, because I'm a stats junkie, I prefer this game over Madden. There's the Top 25 Media, Coach's and the BCS(after completion of week 8) poll updated after every week. In addition, after the regular season, the annual heisman trophy as well as first and second All-America Teams are announced. Another excellent feature is the recruiting season after every year in Dynasty Mode. Even though the high school players drafted are not based off of actual players, this doesn't deter in any way from the enjoyment of the game.   However, there are some flaws and improvements that need to be made. Sometimes, the game slows up considerably, some instances the screen froze up on me, causing me to start over. This led me to save after each and every game played. In addition, sometimes the quarterback loses the ability to pass the ball and is forced to take sacks. When this happens, I immediately restart the entire system. Also, another glitch in the game is when during kickoffs, sometimes the clock runs immediately after kickoff and sometimes the clock runs after the fielder catches the ball(inconsistent). In addition, the default setting (5 min quarters) produces unrealistically low stats, however, 15 min quarters produces unrealistically high stats. Stat-wise, the game should be set at 7 min quarters. Also, I wish there were more defensive plays or options.   All in all, this is a fantastic football game. Best I've played yet! I've spent tons of hours on it and I haven't even played Madden because it's pretty similar. Don't need both. In fact, I tried to return Madden but I already opened it. I recommend playing in the second hardest skill level(All-American). I've played 7 full seasons now(3 with Illinois and 4 with Kent State) and last year, I took Kent State(the worst team in 1-A football) to the Orange Bowl and lost to FSU 13-0 in the BCS Championship. My wide receiver was the Heisman Trophy winner that year. Overall, this is a must buy!	1
I have abandoned my hope that there will ever again be good games for the PC.  PlayStation 2 is the way to go.  I know there will be great games produced for this system for years to come.  NCAA football is just one of those games. I managed to justify getting a playstation 2 and this is the only game I have so far. I don't have a PS or a Nintendo 64 or Dreamcast, so I can't compare this game to that on any other systems, but I do know it is a lot of fun. The graphics are amazing and there are tons of options in Dynasty mode. I've been playing a dynasty with OU Sooners and have been doing pretty well, losing only twice in my first season. And I'm playing on the 2nd most difficult level. I'll try the Heisman level after I win the national title. A few complaints. Playing a game with 6 minute quarters takes about 50 minutes.  I wish it didn't take so long.  I wish you could save games in progress. Playing with 6 minute quarters doesn't produce realistic stats. The announcers are extremely repetitive. Skelly Stadium (Tulsa) is not in the game. I wish you could create schedules or your own team and edit uniforms. But if college football is your favorite sport, this is a great game to reproduce the excitement of the real thing.	1
This is my first 5 star rating since Metal Gear Solid, and this game certainly deserves it. Anyone who gives this game anything less than 4 stars knows very little to nothing about sport games. When I first purchased the game it was extremely slow and froze for 30 seconds when I tried to pull up the menu, but I discovered it was my PS2. I was able to exchange my PS2 and the game plays normal and there are no delays. This game plays a lot like Madden but EA improved on the problems they had with Madden. Unlike Madden, you can actually play defense against the pass; the announcers have a little bit more to say; and it is a little bit easier to run the ball. The game has all the Division I-A teams and some Division I-AA teams. The inside of the stadiums are very detailed and accurate, but the outside background area is off a little. If you play with or against a poor team there are only a few people in the stands, and it is unlikely the game will be televised. Also if you blow a team out in their stadium people start to leave in the fourth quarter. Another great thing about the game is if it is untelevised then there are no commentators, just the play-by-play man over the stadium loud speaker. The game play is fun and challenging but it does not stop there. After the season you are able to recruit high school players; and go through the frustrations of getting committments then losing those players at the last minute. There a few negatives with this game but the major one is the accuracy of the computer quarterbacks. Sometimes that computer is much too accurate with its passes given the caliber of the quarterback. The other negative is that the commentators repeat after a while, but not as bad as Madden. This is one of the best games for PS2 right now. Don't bother renting it since it will be a waste of money; just go out and purchase the game!!! You will not be disappointed.	1
This is easily the best college football game out there for any system.  Overall, the game is a Madden clone looks-wise and gameplay-wise.  There are plenty of features that make this game stand on its own however. There's amazing attention to every detail for every team.  From the uniforms, coaches, mascots, stadiums, playbook, pride stickers, band fight songs, etc...  They not only have the main fightsong, but also the side songs that each school plays in between plays.  This attention to every small detail pays off. The sound on this game is decent.  You'll hear a lot of the same thing from Madden.  The commentating is a bit better and less redundant, but after a few games you'll hear the same things.  The best thing about this game is re-playability.  There is the great dynasty mode and the ability to link with Madden 2002 so you can import your graduating class to the Madden draft.  This is getting  your money's worth.  If you wanted to, you could keep Madden 2002 and this game and never buy another game again. Overall, this is an excellent purchase.  Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it looks too much like Madden (not a bad thing,) but it would've been nice to have its own look.	1
Listen up if there is one football game you should buy...then this is it.  I HATE football and I do mean HATE, but this game makes it worth while....I LOVE this game.  The recuriting is awesome especially when drafting the kids that went to my high school. Buy this game it's the bomb.  I'm telling you there is no game out there that even comes close to this one.  The graphics are spectactular.  The commentary does need a little tweaking, but it suffices. The gameplay is the best ever.  GOD EA Sports is a dream maker.  They made me like football with this game.  BUY IT TODAY, BUY IT NOW, BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!	1
I've been reading some of the reveiws, and it has come to my attention that many NCAA 2002 have a complaint against the computer passing and passing. I have adjusted my game to where the stats are realistic and the computer depending on what school you are playing runs well. I play 10 minute quarters instead of 15 min. I have found this has given my realistic stats adjust your settings and the game will become realistic. Many gamers become frustrated if the AI does not put up a good fight. I found as I become use to the game I adjust the AI to keep it competitive. I have taken Michigan to 3 big ten Titles no national title. I even had a losing season and poor recruiting class, now that is realism.	1
What absolutely amazes me about this game is that it has 117 team's with each team's Stadium Replica. Then on top of that it has each teams fight songs added to it. How they can fit all that on one disk is beyond me. I mean right now I'm playing the CU Buffs. Now I have gone to about 7 or 8 games at Folsom field before. So when the school song plays while I'm watching them on TV I know what to sing etc..., well I find myself doing that as I play this game. I also just noticed that they play another popular band song also. It's all very strange, yet so real. Now on to the game play. On word FLUID. You can tell that the have capitalized on the Maddens game engine. There are a couple of "money" pass plays, but overall the playbooks are great. Speaking of playbooks, they have mirrored the playbooks to the teams. Nebraska, and Air Force run the option...like they do in real life! UNLV, Florida, FSU....passing attack out of the shotgun..like they do in real life. So they AI in my opinion is good if not great. The running plays are perfect. Running the option is just a blast to do. I have yet to get into the Dynasty Mode....yet. I'm just trying to finish my season undefeated. So that right there makes this game worth it. Here I'm not halfway through a season yet, and I have yet to get to the "meat & potatos" of the game. If your a College Fan....run out and get this game. If your a fan of football...sprint to your nearest gaming store! You will never get tired of this game! And with two weeks to go until the real season starts, this game is definately holding me over until that time.	1
I was always a Madden fan until NFL2k came out and when I got my dreamcast I switched my loyalty to sega , even last year when Madden came out for the P2 I prefered NFL2K1.(I am still not sure which one will be better this year Madden 2002 or NFL2K2, I have heard 2k2 will be better) Any way loving college football I chose this game simply because it came out before Sega's new college game (which is still not out) and I have got to tell you that this is by far the best football game I have ever played. Graphics are just amazing from the close up of the players, to the outstretched hands of the recievers to the sidelines. It is fun watching the coach walking up and down the sidelines encouraging or getting upset with the team for a job well done or some stupid mistake. I am playing a Dynasty with Nebraska and went in and changed the names of the players that I knew, I love the fact that the announcers (when doing a tv broadcast) say there names. Other games have done this as well but it seems more fluid then before. The refs are done very well and game play is awesome. Everything about this game is fun, like others have said about fans in the stands, to having all the awards, stats such as pancakes and the BCS (which Sega's version will not have) makes this like I said the best football game there is.  Now just a few quirks, everytime a player runs out of bounds its funny to watch all of the sidline officials fall down, like they have to fall down to get out of the way.  Also I have an injured QB who runs out on the field before the game and is the captain during coin tosses.  To fix this you have to make a roster adjustment and make him the back up QB but its still quirky. Final words, if you like football you should run not walk to your nearest store or pull out your credit card and order this game today...	1
I will skip the basics that everyone else is covering and tell you why I like this game. This is the most realistic college football game ever. You feel like you are actually playing when you run onto the field at the start of each game. EA did a beautiful job of accurately depicting each stadium. You can faintly hear the band play your teams fight song after a score and watch the mascots dance on the side line (I would prefer cheerleaders but the mascots are a nice addition). I keep reading other people complain about the names not included but EA did not leave us out in the cold. You can go into "Edit Players" and add the names to every player on the game and save your roster. Just be sure to rename it since you can't save over the default one. I was shocked when I heard Nessler say "Carter back to recieve the punt." Instead of "Number 2." They will not say every name but if it is common they will call it out. I give EA credit for creating a masterpiece. ROLL TIDE!!!!!!!!!	1
With the summer coming into its final two months we begin to think of football, video football that is, with my purchase of ncaa 2002 I can say this title will set the standard for games to come in the future. The dynasty mode is great, you can recruit  blue chippers or JUCO players. You can earn Challange points and unlock some to the greatest college football teams of all time. I can say that I was hooked when I got the game home and saw the opening credits. For video football fans this is a must have. EA sports is in the game. Keep up the good work gents.	1
The best College game yet, graphics and game play.  A multiple of different game modes (seeson, exibition, practice, and best of all Dynasty).  Doesn't get much more realistic than this, and I am in love with this game already. And one more thing, About the Names of the players?  It is against NCAA rules to do that cause then that would be advertising that player and it would make them proffessionals.  and as we know they are not.  they are collegiat amatuers.  So stop with this name junk, and get a clue. Hands down the best college game , and There is nothing close to it.	1
Just played out my first season last night and here are my impressions. 1) Yes, in terms of graphics and gameplay it is almost like Madden 2001, but is that a bad thing?  Some animations have been tweaked, and the stadiums are in perfect detail.  Though, the problem with the shiny, off-color helmets is still there. 2) The AI is noticably better, for example for the first half of a game, I was tearing the computer up with my passing game.  In the second half, the computer blitzed more, and softened up its coverage.  On defense I am still trying to figure out how the computer's LT gets covered in glue, he's impossible to get free from. 3) The audio is a mixed bag, the effects are great, but the commentary needs some work.  There are three levels of games; local,regional, national and game of the week.  Local games get no audio commentary, just the stadium PA announcer.  However, I've noticed no difference between the other three commentaries. 4) Just about every stat imaginable can be tracked, through I could see no stats for knockdowns and pressures.  The AI finally got rid of it's big school bias in doing the rankings.  In past editions I would be a 12-0 Tulane being ranked behind a 8-4 FSU and 7-5 Tennessee and so on.  However, how coaches are evaluated is dumb.  For Tulane I was given an ultimatum of either go to bowls in 2 of 3 years or one national championship.  Considering Tulane has been to one bowl since 1987, this is unrealistic. 5) I haven't even touched on offseason work, and I allready feel this game clearly is not a Madden clone.	1
EA Sports' much-anticpated college football endeavor for the PS2 has finally arrived.  For years, NCAA Football has offered many college football fans/video gamers a bridge towards the eagerly-anticipated start of the actual season. Simply put, NCAA 2002 does not disappont. The graphics are very good.  I don't want to say excellent, as in some ways, I find the graphics on Madden 2001 a little bit better.  The details are sharper (you can see more wrinles in the jerseys), but the actual proportions of arm muscles, head size and muscle tone is somewhat inconsistent.  (The fact that we're even discussing muscle tone and shirt wrinkles is amazing in and of itself.)  Animations seem to be plentiful.  Unlike Madden 2001, where every reception by a player was a pirouette, the animations for receptions alone are numerous. Gameplay is superb.  Controls are very realisitic and the action is very realistic.  The addition of the 3 man announcing team of Brad Nessler, Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit leave much to be desired.  Corso is as annoying as Madden is, saying the same things time and time again, over and over.  Not much to offer, either.  The play by play and color commentary sometimes don't truly match the action on the field, and can get repetitive very quickly.  This needs to be improved. The best feature of this game, however, is the Dynasty Mode.  College Football enthusiasts will love the fact that you can build your own team up from the ashes by recruiting freshmen, redshirtng players and cutting players who don't perform.  The depth of this feature is mind-boggling, and anyone who played previos versions of NCAA will not be disappointed. They've left out the Great Games feature, which allowed you to re-live some of the Great Games in college history, and added the 'Campus Challenge,' which is similar to the 'Madden Cards.'  In 'Campus Challenge,' you earn points for accomplishing certain milestones, i.e. getting a safety, rushing a 50 yard TD, holding the CPU opponent to certain number of points.  Earning these points allow you to unlock hidden codes like new stadiums, Great Teams from the past and various cheats. All in all this is a must-have for the Football Freak!!	1
No doubt, this game is gonna be HOT!If it plays like madden2k1 and looks like it at all, this will be the game of the year.....i've read tons of websites reviews on this game and even seen some movies on it......trust me, this game lives up to all the hype it is giving off! Get your copy ....i know i will.......	1
Good	1
Great deal	1
It has all the fun games.	1
Finally! I can play my favorite Pac Man games on the go! Screw the Wii U Virtual Console version of the game. This is better.	1
as expected	1
I love Pac-Man, I grew up playing some Pac-man, so I decided to order this one to play on the Nintendo DS, while I wait to order the GBA console.  It is great fun for adults and kids alike. I recommend this and similar games.	1
I had a copy of this first as a kid, its great for any pac man fan. a lot of fun games, and options, and love how it looks	1
For the price the game is amazing. The only reason that it did not get five stars is because of the full size screen was way too small to see	1
The product was in excellent conditions. My nephew is going to enjoy it a lot. Thank you very much. Better than described.	1
For several years, I have played various versions of Pac-Man games.  What's included on this GBA package isn't all that bad, but I would have liked to see 2 additional installments -- Super Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man (the former is included on Namco Museum Megamix for the Wii).  However, what IS included is still good.  Pac-Man Original -- Who doesn't get sick of playing this??  All of the graphics and Pac-Man sounds are faithfully intact.  It's still as hard as ever making it to the 3rd cut mini-scene but once you do it's a riot!!  Pac-Attack -- At first it is difficult to understand how the gameplay works so it's probably best to start in Puzzle Mode.  It's great to have passwords included because some of the 100 puzzle levels are not easy.  But the music is rather repetitious and doesn't change at all.  Pac-Mania -- This version is okay but the soundtrack has been edited.  In order to hear the full versions, you would have to play the unlockable versions on Pac-Man World 2 or Namco Museum.  But the graphics on the small screen are still easy to see and the fun doesn't stop.  Pac-Man Arrangement -- THIS is the true gem of the collection.  Once you start you won't stop.  Everything about this version is spectacular.  If you make it to the final level you will have a boss robot to defeat.  Unfortunately, the only other console you would find this game on is the PSP.  So, overall, not bad, but as I stated, could have fit in the other 2 Pac-Man games.	1
Pac-Man Collection is a compilation of four incredibly awesome Pac-Man games. The games are:  Pac-Man: Play the original arcade hit that started it all! You should know what this classic is like by now.  Pac-Mania: A fake 3D take on the original, in which there are new mazes and worlds.  Pac-Attack: A cool spin off of Tetris. Every 3 blocks Pac-Man drops, and then he would eat any ghost in his path.  Pac-Man Arrangement (HIGHLIGHT OF THIS CARTRIDGE): The best arcade Pac-Man game yet! 5 worlds with nonstop munchin' fun!  So I'm pretty sure all fans would get a kick out of this collection. With these titles, what can go wrong for you in the fun factor?	1
Pac-Man is a legendary gaming character who is known for running around a maze being chased by ghosts all while eating Pac-Dots.  This game collection comes with 4 variations of the basic game, and these variations are really quite fun.  First you have the basic Pac-Man.  You are given a board to eat all of the Pac-Dots on, but of course, there are four ghosts chasing you, and if they touch you, you lose a life.  However, if you eat a power pellet, all of the ghosts become edible for a short amount of time and you are able to eat them, forcing them to go back to their "safe area" in the middle of the board and change back to their regular selves.  After you eat all of the Pac-Dots on a board, you move up to the next level which is always a bit harder, but when you lose all of your lives, it's game over, and to play again, you have to start over from the beginning.  This is the traditional Pac-Man game that a lot of people came love.  The second game is Pac-Man Arrangement.  This game is an updated form of the regular Pac-Man game, but everything moves a bit faster.  You are able to move around faster, but so are the ghosts.  It also incorporates a bit of logic as it will add such things as warp zones or always edible ghosts into the gameplay, but these things are explained as the game progresses.  If a ghost touches you, you still lose a life, but if you lose all lives, you are given the option to continue play where you left off, only with your starting back at zero.  Also, at the end, there is a boss to beat, making this game quite different from the regular game with a few similarities to keep the original Pac-Man spirit.  For the third game, there is something called Pac Attack.  Now, this is almost like Tetris as you have to deal with ghosts and blocks falling from the sky.  You can arrange them the way that you want to in order to be able to eat them when Pac-Man falls from the sky.  The goal is to get the blocks lined up in row, which is when they will disappear, and to get the ghosts where Pac-Man can eat them all.  It's more of a puzzle game that requires a bit of fast thinking, but it is still a fun game.  And, lastly, there is PacMania.  This game is much like the original Pac-Man game only with a few small changes.  First of all, it is zoomed in a lot making it impossible to see the entire board at the same time.  Another change is that Pac-Man is able to jump over ghosts.  You have to time it perfectly, because if Pac-Man is just a little off, he will lose a life due to the ghost touching him, but it does add a possible way of getting away from ghosts.  The Power Pellets, of course, are there, too.  This is almost exactly like the original game with just a few updates, which makes it better in my opinion.  Overall, this game collection is a fun assortment of games that are entertaining for all.  My only problem would be that there aren't enough games.  I wish that a few more had been added, but still, the four games that are offered are really fun Pac-Man games that I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for some fun, easy games to unwind with.	1
Great collection of some of the best games of all time, and easily one of my favorite GBA games. This version of the original game is much better than the version on Namco Museum for DS.  As another customer mentioned, there is (sadly) no way to save your high scores. Doesn't really bother me, 'cuz I'm the only one who plays it in my house, and everybody knows that high score tables were really meant to be seen by everyone else, not the person who put them there!  Pac-Man in full screen mode is probably the most fun game in this collection. Scrolling mode is more of a challenge, if you find full screen too easy.  Pac-Mania is a fun variant with 3D graphics.  Pac-Attack is an interesting puzzle game, similar to Tetris, yes, but retaining some of Pac-Man's famous monster chomping antics.  Pac-Man Arrangement isn't dull by any means, though the two-player simultaneous version on GameCube's Namco Museum is more fun.  If you enjoy Pac-Man and want to get your power pellet fix on the run, this collection was made for you!	1
Pac-Man Collection is no doubt a must have for any Pac-man lover/GBA owner. It includes the original Pac-Man, a 3D rehash of Pac-Man called Pac-Mania, a semi-3D rehash of Pac-man with powerups and lots of new stuff added, and finally, Pac-attack, a tetris-style puzzle game originally for the super nintendo. It's super fun and worth every penny.	1
WOW!  Original Pac-man. No matter what you think of the other games here, don't knock it.  It's frickin' Pac-man!  Ok, ok, sorry.  I'm gushing cuz I remember actually being able to play this in an arcade.  God, I'm old.  LOL  I'm cool with it.  For you old enough to have been there, BUY THIS!  Nostalgia is a beautiful thing.  For you young pups, not sure what to tell you other than, well, you used to be able to go to a place called an arcade (I know, you had to leave the front of the TV), hang out with your friends and play video games.  It was a great way to throw away a fistful of quarters and not be sitting at home and still have an awesome time.	1
Ever since I've worked at this summer day camp, Pac-man (along with Ms. Pac Man) were my favorites among their choice of arcade machines in the game rooms. Thus, bringing it back further to my nostalgic Atari days. No buttons; just the turn of a joystick. While the GBA unfortunately lacks that periphal, Pac-Man Collection offers 4 good games ranging in difficulty and strategy. Pros: - The Classic Pac Man game and the short-lived Pac-Mania - A chance for Pac-Mania to shine with superb graphics - Passwords for puzzle mode in Pac-Attack, allowing you to continue the last level you completed -The settings menu. Need more lives? More levels? Feel free to splurge. -All the sounds and cut-scenes Cons: -Because of the GBA's shape, the Full Screen and Scroll for Pac-Man aren't too great, since Full Screen shrinks the gamefield down considerably and Scroll only shows half at a time. Pac-Man is best when you can see the whole field in good detail -Pac-Mania offers too-many-deaths since you can't really see ghosts coming from the bottom of the screen -Pac-Arrangement is fun but the game ends quickly -Pac-Attack's Normal Mode is tough; stick with Puzzle Mode Although I wish the original Pac-Man had more level variety like Ms. Pac Man, this is still a must-have for the retro-gamers who actually played an Atari. Pretty cheap, too. So chop down on a must-have for your GBA!	1
It just surprises me when it really comes to video games these days. It all seems quite fancy with too much visual graphics, that it really kills the enjoyment of classics. That does come into the cases with classics from the 80's, that truly broadened the video game formatted market into a whole new level and beyond belief. That did come with the case of Pac-Man. It truly was one of the very first revolutionary video game characters ever. The feeling of Pac-Man still lingers on today. Despite many people thinking of Pac-Man as a throwback, there is a simplicity to the puzzles and mazes that this Yellow chomp has truly made in its long run, and it fits just as well here. The Pac-Man Collection for the Game Boy Advance, is a collection of 4 of the classic games from the Pac-Man library. The games in itself are a great feel to all different audiences of Pac-Man, and his supporting casts of ghosts: Inky, Blinky, Clyde, Sue, and others just to name about. The games range from the Tetris-like feel of Pac-Attack, which truly is one of the few games that really wasn't like Pac-Man, to the realism of the maze, like the original version of Pac-Man, and one of the very first 3-D games ever made, Pac-Mania, to the ever changing realism of Pac-Man Arrangement. This particular game has just incredible graphics, well beyond some other Game Boy Advance games have been made since the Game Boy Advance came into release in 2001. Still, many people might be dissapointed, with the absence of other great games missing from this collection, including Ms. Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, Pac-Man Jr., and Pac Man 2 which was released in 1994, as the only unfortunate dud of the chomping legend. Although Pac-Man is everywhere as a nostalgic throwback to the 1980's, many people might not want this version for the Game Boy Advance. Still, Pac-Man and his chomping impact are well worth the buck over here. If you have a Game Boy Advance, this game collection has to be one addition for the books.	1
If you still have "Pac Man Fever" check out NamcoMuseum for the GBA. It has Ms. Pac Man, and many other games which put these to shame. As someone who works in video games, I never heard so many complaints about a game, as I did this one (i.e. - too difficult, too boring etc)	-1
IT HAS GREAT CLASSIC PAC MAN GAMES ON IT. IT BETTER THEN ANY OTHER PAC MAN GAME. I LOVE IT. AND I THINK YOU WILL TO THAT IS WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD GET IT.	1
4 Games for the price of one. Pac-Man Arrangement, a 2.5D (not totally 3d) version of pac-man that is probably the best of the 4 games, Old Skool Pac-Man;(nuff said),Pac-Attack; A Tetris-like Pac-Man Game with 100 levels of insanity, and Pac-Mania; a 3D Pac-Man who can jump over the ghosts, answering my childhood question, why doesn't pac-man jump over the ghosts.	1
Buckener & Garcia had a hit 1982 song "Pac Man Fever" and that's what you'll have if you are playing this game.  The graphics are great, you can actually see the characters and Pac-Man is very addictive.  Four versions are included to keep game playing value very high.  I really like the Pac-Attack, a Tetris-like game that is included along with the Original, Pac-Man Arrangement, and Pac-Mania, a 3D game that's fun to play. This game is worth the money if you are a fan of original arcade games!	1
Pac-Man Collection has four old but great Pac-Man games which are newly restored on the GameBoy Advance. It includes the regular arcade old Pac-Man,the colorful version of Pac-Man Arrangement,the wonderful 3D Pac-Mania,and the tetris game of Pac-Attack. The old Pac-Man is just plain chomping on dots and avoiding ghosts. Pac-Man Arrangement is a more detailed and colorful version of the old Pac-Man. Pac-Mania is just like the others but it's in wonderful 3D and Pac-Man also can jump to avoid the ghosts. Pac-Attack is tetris with a Pac-Man theme to it. You stack blocks and ghosts and you stack Pac-Man near the ghosts so he can gobble them up. Pac-Man Collection is a great game with four great Pac-Man games which are loads of fun. One of the best GameBoy Advance games around.	1
While PS1 games will play on a PS2 machine, many/most not only require a PS1 card in order to save your games, but it has to be an original Sony card. Those are harder to find. If the card is new it's expensive but if it's used you have to find a seller with good ratings who states that the card has been tested and is working.  Also with a used card there may be data already on there. Just overwrite the old files.	1
Now I have something that I can save my Silent Hill data on.	1
Lie the original.	1
perfect and was used even.	1
Good card.	1
I got a cherry red one in Japanese, but at least it is SONY, so I'm satisfied.	1
product description was excellent and I would gladly do business with this seller again.	1
Perfect. Exactly as described	1
Nothing short from what is described. I'm satisfied with this memory card defiantly came handy for game saves. from some recent ps1 game purchase's. I'd highly recommend this seller.	1
it works good	1
What more is there to say? If you have a PS1, you gotta have one.	1
Not the original. Very disappointed...	-1
i love it  great product	1
Came as promised.  Thank you!	1
good quality and nice to have the extra storage.	1
Great for saving PS1 games. Works on a PS2.	1
works well	1
Was very happy with this purchase.	1
well the cord is alright but i didn't know that kind of cord went to a playstation 2.	-1
No Damaged. Very good. thank you.	1
I love it, Thanks	1
When one of my memory cards didn't work, I look for a new one in different video game store and I was glad I found it here.	1
Good	1
I love this memory card, specifically because it came with FFVIII's last save point already on it, so I can play Ultimecia again, and again, and again...	1
A highly valued game in Japan, this game should be great in it's american debut. As  a commander, you must control your troops and deploy new ones that will destroy enemies. There are a total of 19 different units that you can build, from the rocket launchers to the submarines and the aircraft. There are other special features, such as Fog of War that will hide units or aircraft that will power them on. After you capture the Headquarters of your enemy and destroy all of their troops, the game is over with a victory under your belt.  In Single Player you must play the role of the Orange Star army, and overcome campaigns that focus you against the 3 countries of your region, Blue Moon, Green Earth, and Yellow Comet. There are more special features in the Single Player campaigns, as there are Commanding Officers that will join you with their special powers that could be anything almost.  In 2, 3, or 4 player maps, you must stop all the enemies and live to tell the tale. Another Feature is that there are 144 different maps for you to choose from.   The multiplayer on this game is also good. It will be fun to play with 3 different friends simultaniously, a real showdown of skill. A GBA and Game Pak will be required for each of these players however, as this is a very large and complicated game that takes up a lot of space.   Overall, this game should be great, as it will bring a whole new dimension to the GBA: Strategy. If you like Age of Kings or Command and Conquer, this game is for you.	1
Not much to say about it, other than it works perfectly, and that's really the highest praise you can give this type of product. My PS2 is pretty far from my chair, but this cable bridged the gap just fine.	1
Helped extend the PS2 controller from the PS2 console unit on top of my dresser, over to my bed on the diagonally opposite end of the bedroom.	1
Works like a charm but it feels pretty cheaply made. I'm honestly waiting for it to stop working.	1
doesn't work on PS2, the analog sticks won't work with it...	-1
Works well!	1
Love it	1
Not much I can say about this memory card other than it does what it is suppose to do. I have not had any trouble with it so far	1
Very nice	1
All it is is a 6' extension cable for PS2 controllers. It works as advertised. No frills, no BS. Just a decent cable at a decent price.	1
Product was worn and needed a little TLC but all ps2 accessories are going to have some wear ... it's nice to be able to sit back and play games from across the room	1
These are really great for sitting back from your PS2.	1
This thing works like a charm. I recently bought a new PS2 controller and decided to get an extension cable so I didn't have to get so close to my television. I haven't had any trouble with this, whether I'm playing PS1 or PS2 games. Highly recommended!	1
This item is a must if your controller is not wireless.  Great service.:)	1
Now i have power to my PS2!!!!	1
Just what  i needed.	1
I love them.	1
Old but still good. It holds up well.	1
i recently played 'advanced wars: dual strike' and was impressed by how addicting the game play was. when i beat it, i decided to go back and check to see if there were any more games in the series. it turns out that dual strike was the 9th game in the series. i was tempted to go ahead and start playing the sequel to 'dual strike', entitled 'days of ruin'. however, my completionist side urged me to start with this title first. i was happy i did.  'advance wars' on a GBA looked just as good as 'dual strike' did on my DS, so the regression in graphics wasn't as harsh as i thought it would be. 90% of the same type of battle units from 'dual strike' are in 'advanced wars', so there wasn't much of a learning curve. i was a bit annoyed that the field training mode was not optional. it's actually a very lengthy 17 mission tutorial on the various combat aspects of the game. it did cover some aspects of combat i felt were not covered in 'dual strike' (such as terrain) but it's possible i just skipped over it without realizing. i later found out that if you skip ahead and simply beat the last field training mission, you can proceed to the normal campaign mode, but the tutorial is very helpful if you've never played a game from this series before.  as far as the plot goes, it's fairly simple. a lot of the same characters from 'dual strike' are featured in 'advance wars', so it's interesting to kind of flashback and see their origins. this game takes place in the continent of 'cosmoland'. the orange nation is suddenly attacked by olaf of the blue moon kingdom. the field training involves you slowly gaining back the ground lost to the blue moon kingdom.  you encounter the other colored named nations: yellow comet, green earth, etc. ultimately, as with the other games in the series, the black hole army is trying to take over. in this game they try to take over cosmoland by causing unrest through trickery. you and the other nations will figure out the truth and stop try to stop them.  you control three different commanding officers (andy, max and sami), or COs, each of whom have their own unique talents and abilities. the objective and circumstances of each mission could change depending on which CO is chosen for the mission. i played this game just once through, didn't unlock everything. i'm told that depending on which CO is chosen for specific missions, it could unlock additional missions or other game goodies. who knows, this game was fun but i don't have time to play a 13 year old game more than once, lol. i have however, decided to play any other available games from the 'wars' series including 'battalion wars' and 'battalion wars 2' for the gamecube and wii respectively. the final title in the series is 'days of ruin', but before i can play any of those it's on to 'advance wars 2: black hole rising'.  i said this when i wrote my review for 'dual strike' but the 3DS would be smart to add a 'wars' game to its catalogue.	1
A fun and suprisingly intuitive stratey game.  I love how all the characters are so happy as they wipe out each others soldiers.	1
Advance Wars has all the makings of a classic, from its fun and addicting gameplay to its appropriate graphics and sound, this game set the standard which all other portable  turn based strategy games will have to live up to.  While the story in this game might be subpar, the characters( COs) and their powers are creative and are evenly matched out.  Max's powerful tanks are evened out by the fact that he has very weak rockets, while Sam's ability to make her infantry capture bases really fast is offset by the fact that all her other ground units are weak and for a long-range specialist like Grit, his powerful rockets, who get extended range, are matched by his weak tanks.  Each of the different units match up well and none of the units seem particularly overpowering or unfair, though when you fist see an MD tank roles through your undefended rockets or artillery you might think so.  The different maps in the story mode have different objectives, from saving a certain unit to defending a base for a certain number of days, to destroying a specific unit or just plain capturing the enemy base.  While this game mostly relies on a money system in order for you to create units is sometimes just gives you a set number of units to start out with and those are probably the funniest levels, all tactics, with no resources involved.  Other than that the game gets great replay value from the 150 or so maps in the vs. and war rooms, while the map creator just adds to the fun that can be had, especially since you can play against a friend on those created maps.  Don't be thrown off by the colorful, childish graphics, they are actually quite useful and you can clearly tell the difference between a mech and a infantry.  One other thing to not is that when to units battle it changes to another screen in which the units battle each other out, sort of like Fire Emblem.  These animations can be turned off if you are short on time but they are fun and engaging to watch.  The sound might not be the focus of the game, the tunes for each CO is fun and upbeat and they never get tired or old.  Also the sounds for each of the different units is distinct so that you can clearly tell the difference between them.  Overall this is an outstanding game that and any GBA owner will want to pick up.	1
I loved this product when I first got it.  I used it daily and loved the freedom.  But shortly after my dear daughter spilled nail polish remover all over it and it has since died.  I would definately recommend this product, it is great.  Just keep it away from liquids.	1
gives you plenty of room between your system and you at least wyour wired controller works which I cannot say of any of the wireless controllers I have purchased DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON them this is much cheaper and works.	1
ps2 cable extension	1
good cable	1
I purchased several of these and found them to be great.  We could attach the system to the TV and sit on the couch or chair in comfort and play the games. We did put a towel/small rug over the wires to prevent accidents.	1
great	1
Holds Memory	1
Was so amazed you could still find these things.  Finding ones with good batteries is even more impressive.	1
thank you	1
This was the wrong cord. It says Playstation 2 but it was a Playstation 1 cord.	-1
It works.	1
Arrived quickly and works fine.	1
My first Advance Wars game was  the second game (Black Hole Rising). It was my first strategy game. So I got into Fire Emblem and Rebel Star Tactical Command, and the DS Advance Wars: Dual Strike. After playing all of these games, I started looking for the first Advance Wars game. I lucked out one day and found a used copy in a Gamestop store.  I didn't know what was going on at first. I was fighting Olaf and Grit, and other characters that you play and fight with on your team in the other AW instalments. I finished it and found the answer I was looking for.  The replay value is very high. You collect coins at the end of a battle and can use them to buy maps, map cases (don't know what those are for yet), and CO's like grit and Drake once you've cleared the game's campaign mode.  If you want to play a friend you can share the system and pass it when your turn is done. Nice for those who don't have another system, game, and link.  I think this was the easiest out of the three AW games. This isn't a huge problem though. You can always try to get higher rankings on levels in the campaign and war room.  All in all this is a great game that will work your mind and your thumbs for many hours.	1
You take on the role of a Commanding Officer (CO) in a cartoony world at perpetual war with itself. Easy to get into, and deceptively deep. Advance Wars is strategy at its best. What makes it so special? First, the graphics are great. The animations are instant gratification when a well-timed attack turns the tide of battle, help you visualize battle results in several ways so you know exactly how your units are doing. Second, the options for multiplayer are excellent. Because the game is turn based, 4 players can play together even on only one system. Grab a friend, and enjoy the anticipation of having the system handed back to you and seeing your opponent smirk as you stumble into their trap (playing on seperate systems can be done, but isn't nearly as fun).  The most important facet of this game is depth. Fog of War (where parts of the map your units can't see are blacked out) makes for intensity- you're always trying to calculate what forest or hilltop might contain enemy units waiting for you. The basics of troop movements give way to incredible strategy (delay the enemy tank by sacrifing your troops, or retreat and lure the tank into range of your artillery?). Each CO is completely unique (Max has stronger tanks, but weaker artillery. Sami has tougher troops, but weaker vehicles) and thier individual powers add an extra level of depth to the process.  Advance Wars is an amazing game for singleplayer action. Add in a full-featured map creator, a ton of unlockable COs, and the wealth of options, and this is one of the best multiplayer games on the GameBoy. A must-have.	1
Advanced Wars is everything you could ask for in a strategy game. If you're like me and you love turn based strategy then look no further, Advance Wars is definately up to par with the host of other tactical RPGs for GBA. While it's not an rpg by any means i can't see anyone who likes Final Fantasy Tactics not falling in love with this game. I love turn based strategy and Advance Wars is definately pretty high up on the list of must owns for the genre. The lack of an RPG element (which has pretty much taken over turn based strategy games in recent years) is somewhat of a blessing. Don't get me wrong i enjoy building up characters but it's definatly a nice change of pace to be able to just jump in and start playing without worrying about much else. It's also worth mentioning that Advance Wars is fairly difficult.  The extensive tutorial while somewhat annoying in its length is probably necessary for the vast majority of gamers. There are quite a few battles where one mistake will easily put you out of commission. Advance Wars definely deserves 5 Stars	1
You already know the game's great reputation from the many other reviews; I want to add here that this classic is a perfect game for learning how to Turn Based Wargame. 1) The later version called Advance Wars 2 is an upgrade in many areas including graphics and weaponry. But this original version, while indeed challenging, is more friendly to the beginner (less difficult to win). One can always sell it right here later, and then upgrade. 2) One old 2001 or 2002 issue of "Nintendo Power Advance" magazine (usually available on Ebay auctions) featured a long in depth strategy guide to this exact game (pages 36 to 60 are all devoted to this first version of Advance Wars). Find that particular issue ( I think it was volume 2) for help while advancing from recruit to grognard. 3) If buying used, a cartridge which also includes the original printed manual (game guide booklet) will help orientate the player to gameplay procedures and options. Salute!	1
We needed this item, as many other people do, because our controller cables were too short to reach the couch.  This extension cable works great.  We got two a couple of years ago and it solved our problem.  The wireless controllers we were buying (over and over again) kept breaking.  They are not nearly as good as the corded ones.  - A couple of times I thought there was something wrong with one of these cords, and here it was the playstation itself.  We replaced our playstation and everything works great.  So, if you need these, go ahead and buy them.  We had great luck with ours, and we have wrapped them up wrong to store them and traveled with them.  very good.	1
Just what my son needed, works great. Also cut down on traffic in the floor in front of the tv.	1
I like it, needed a memory card for my PSone games, only bad thing, seller never erased their saved games. Really? I don't want your saved games on the memory card. Erase them next time you sell something.	1
the memory card came right on the day they said it would . the memory card is in excellent condition and works perfectly ! a great deal !	1
Well it was a fake, it had no play station symbol on it why even put a picture on it, if its not the same.	-1
awsome	1
This game is up there with all the other GBA games, GB color games, and regular GB games.  A way to describe it is like Risk with really good graphics.  This game may look like it's for kids, but it's not.  I'd say it's for ages 11+.  Not at all for the possibility of it being a bloody war game (it's not), but because this is really a stragititic game.  It's difficult, but also very fun.  This game is a real thinker, but I love it.  I'ts deffinatley one of the best Game Bay games ever made, probably in the top 10.  There's really only one word needed to describe this game: GREAT!  It's definatley worth the money which is rare these days.	1
At first, I was a bit irratated with the happy anime look of advance wars, but after I saw past that, the gameplay was absolutly excellant. The campaign mode is a little tiresome, but the game really shines in its Vs. Mode. You can play againts up to FOUR people or computers. And unlike many modern strategy games, this one actually has STRATEGY to it. As ill-intelligent and biased as this review may sound, play the game, I enjoyed it. Unfourtunatly tho, it does get a little boring a little quickly, but what can you do?	1
PS2 Controller Extension Cable:  I purchased two of these and they work great.  I can now sit on my couch and play.  I would definitely get them.  Even though we have a PS3 and Wii we sometimes play the old PS2 games because we have so many of them.  At $5 a piece these are great!!!	1
The memory card I was sent works, does exactly what I need it to do for the many PS1 games I have. Couldn't be happier.	1
No problems, works great, one of my favorite memory cards! Maybe due to the nostalgia but still I love it. High quality product by sony!	1
but it worked well my savegames stayed exactly on the card where they belonged ceased running around the neighborhood kicking elderly people in the shins.  Wonderful PS1 savegame wrangler.	1
Product looks and works in its "used-acceptable" condition as described. It holds enough PS1 video games, but that is fine, because I can always copy my PS1 games over to one of my PS2 memory card (I have two: one for only PS2 game saves; one for only PS1 games). For example, when the PS1 memory card space is full, I copy however many games I want over to my 8mb PS2 memory card, check to make sure it copied over to the PS2, then delete those games from my PS1 card so that I now have more PS1 space, and just copy it back over to my PS1 memory card when I'm ready to play it again. :D	1
Great service and price.	1
I thought this game wouldn't be that GOOD...but i was wrong! this game is great! you fight wars, and you get to build tanks, subs and planes and stuff. you have to think of how to win. this is the BEST strategy game since Starcraft. you can also link up with friends and play against the computer. i also love seeing a bunch of tanks blow up a marine [don't worry, there's no blood]. if you like turn based strategy, BUY THIS!!!!!!!	1
I guess brand matters. It is working good so far. Mine came with a dust protector plastic case. Very nice.	1
I received a PS1 and not an original Playstation 1 memory card. I know it may sound stupid but I'm one of those who likes to match accessories to their consoles since I still have an original Playstation. I still gave it 5 stars however, only because the item itself works and also the seller refunded me the amount and didn't ask for it back...(??) But hey, it is what it is.	1
These are useful, and Sony did make the best for the PS1. Off brands are not the way to go if you can find these still.	1
Great product	1
High quality, & long lasting. Highly recommended.	1
Do you like Starcraft or the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000 if you like either of those this game is perfect for you and you don't even get paint on your fingers (for those who play warhammer40k)! The game more resembles Warhammer 40k than starcraft but it's still close to starcraft. If you can imagine Starcraft with limited movement and turns thats what this game is. The game gets extremely hard when you get up into the Kanbei missions. In the game you are an Advisor to a CO (commanding officer) you choose. every CO has a special power. Andy, the CO you start with has the ability to repair all units by 2 HP (hit points). Other CO powers do damage to all your units or give their units a power boost or make them move farther ETC. If you disliked the fog of war in starcraft you'll hate it even more in this game. And the CO you'll hate the most is Eagle his power makes all units move and attack twice!...	1
I love this game. I spent many a fun afternoon kicking back drinking tea and playing this game. I haven't enjoyed a stragety game as much as this since StarCraft on my PC. It's turn based but that's ok especially when you get a phone call you can put the unit down, finish the call and then continue. You may miss the computer attack on it's turn but you won't miss any decisions for you to make and you can also save anytime. The battles were all very fun and if I have only one complaint it's that the computer was not blinded by the fog of war but you were. However this is ok as you could explore a map first taking losses then restart it and know where the enemies forces were. This game has the right mix of difficulty and stragety. There are not any missions that are so tough that you stop playing out of frustration(though there is 1 level where you can't win by fighting and holding out. You need to run with 1 guy and keep the enemy away for a number of turns to win). The last battle was for me the most fun. Yes it was hard and I had to stop once and restart it, but with some strategy the computer was toast. :) I realize this game may not be for everyone. The type of person that likes run/jump/shoot type games. However if you like strategy war type games such as Star Craft where you move troops into position to attack enemies or like building an army and colonizing for resources to fight a war of attrition(many battles including the last were like this) then this is the game for you. One thing I really liked about this game is how it nicely introduced new concepts piecemeal and had very good and helpful tutorial levels. The gameplay and moves and menus were superb. It's not like other strategy games I've played(Like Tatics Orge) that had confusing menus and controls. You can move and deploy quick in this game. Very fun game and very addictive with replay value. :) I've had to force myself to put it away for a while so that I can read some books I've been meaning to read. Most people won't regret buying this game.	1
But as a memory card, very solid. If you are still rocking the PS/PS2. These work fine with clear and blue back disks. Comes new which is awesome.	1
I am not really sure why this item needs a 'fun' rating but I guess it does make games more fun, the ability to save and all. I purchased this item used and it works great. It is a quality Sony product and you will not be disappointed by it.	1
The momory card I received was NOT the one pictured.  I received a generic knock off product.  My PS1 did not even recognize it as a memory card.  Beware!  Amazon are you reading this? I hope so.	-1
I bought this to play PS1 games in my PS2. The previous memory card I tried did not work. (It was not Sony brand.) While this works, when it was formatted, it lost 80% of its stated capacity. There is still enough room for my purposes, because I have only a couple PS1 games, but it's worth noting that you don't get a full megabyte -- not even close. Of course, it could be that a got a bad one. I did get a used one.	1
great value for money handy for saving games on the playstation wat time i can i remember this only holds 15 spaces on it	1
advance wars is a great game! Control your own army and play in three great versions: first is field training this is how you learn to play ,second is vs mode this is where you do a bunch of differnt missions, and finally third: this is where you can link up with up to four friends for the ultiment battle! Well ive told you all i could not to spoil it.  If you dreamed of commanding your own army  buy this game!!!	1
Advanced Wars is a turned based strategy game.  I happen to love this style of game, but unfortunatly there aren't many games that go into this.  Sure there are simple turned base strategy with rpg elemetns like pokemon and such, but now you get to command a whole army and in some parts even raise an army to battle.  This game will last you for a long time to come.  Between secret characters and a multiplayer game, it won't end any time soon.  Of course there is the normal campaign mode, where you procede through the game as normal, a training mode to teach you how to play this truely great game.  To add to this there is a war room to play all the battles you've played.  If this isn't enough there are tons of maps to unlock and you can even build your own.  Probably my favorite feature is the multiplayer option.  With it you do a multiplayer game with just yourself and ai, or with as many human players as you want.  The great part is you can just hand the system off to a freidn after your turn, so there's no NEED for another system to play with a friend!  Truely an advantage of this style of game.	1
if you need one,gotta have it	1
It's just a PS2 / 3 power cord. Keep in mind this is NOT a PS2 SLIM power cord, however if you have a PS2 Slim power adapter (that actually plugs into the console) this can plug into that and it will work just fine.	1
I could not find the power cord.  This fit.	1
it's a plug. It works	1
This is one deep game. Included are ground troops, naval units, and air units. Each has their own sub catagories: Ground: melee (infantry, tanks, anti-air machine guns) and indirect (rocket launchers, artillary, anti-air ranged attackers) Naval: subs, cruisers, and battleships (your resident indirect unit) Air: copters(transport, fair attacker) and planes (fighters, bombers) Each has specifics as to what they are effective against.  For example, the fighter jets can only attack other air units, but they do so almost unconditionally effectively.  The player must worry about fuel consumption for each unit, many consume different amounts, like air units use 5 per day, terrain effects in addition to unit-attack compatability, CO powers, which can unfairly turn the battle in your opponents favor, and base capture, which is usually the main goal of campaigns. This only scratches the surface of this game's depth.  Included is a very lengthy campaign, numerous individual maps that begin you with no units and require speed, efficiency, and power to take the enemy's main base, and a 3-hour tutorial on the game's basics. Recommended to all who have a craving for intense, turn-based strategy on the almost-already-venerable Gameboy Advance.	1
I just bought Advance Wars, even though some of my friends dissed it saying, "It's just not that exciting."  Well, they must have been high.  If you had the money to buy a GBA and one game only, I'd get a GBA (duh) and Advance Wars. My only complaints are that there is a fairly long learning curve, the somewhat-cutsie anime box-art doesn't scream "tanks and bombers are my friends," and that...okay, two complaints.  The PS2 has Metal Gear Solid 2, the Dreamcast has Jet Grind Radio, the PC has Counter-Strike, and the GBA has Advance Wars. "Why should I pay ... for this??"  I just answered that question...	1
I was a little skeptical before I bought this, but gamespot.com and about every reviewer here gave this game high marks, so I bought it solely based on that.  I only buy games that are a lot of fun and have great replay value.  The four games I own are Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, F-Zero, Super Mario Advance, and this one.  I only regret buying Mario, as I'm old enough to have played the heck out of it the first time around. This is one of those games where every time you look up, it's two hours later.  The tutorial is fun and essential.  The strategy is top notch and it's a lot more fun than PC games of the same genre.  You really feel like you've accomplished something when you clear a map by finding the weakness.  The music gets old fast, but the game loses nothing when the music is turned off.  Thanks to Nintendo for coming out with another classic.  It's been many years since they've done anything really new.	1
It's very rare that you see an item on amazon.com with over 100 reviews and 5-stars. No matter how good something is; it's usually at 4.5... Not Advance Wars, though. It's just that good! A turn-based strategy game for Game Boy Advance; it resembles Command-and-Conquer with its tanks, bases, planes; etc. With several game modes including a campaign to play after you complete the mandatory training ... you deploy troops at bases that capture other bases and fight the enemy. Some maps have ports for ships and/or airports to build planes and helicopters as well. Holding these bases, along with cities, is how you collect your income at the beginning of each turn. The interface is very slick; you can always find out everything about a unit or square by hitting the 'R' button. You also get to pick a commander to lead your troops, and they all have strengths and weaknesses as well as special abilities. The Naval CO can unleash Tsunamis on units, but his planes aren't the best in the sky... All in all, Advance Wars is my favorite Game Boy game since Tetris, and is *the* essential game for the GBA... It's just too much fun!	1
Before I bought this item, I looked everywhere around my area for a playstation 1 memory card. Could not find anything. I guess these are rare to find now? So, I bought this. What can I say? It is an original Playstation 1 memory card.	1
This is the only Playstation One Memory Card worth getting, The rest break down over time this one last for a decent while. Yeah yeah, I still play the PS1!!!	1
gift for a friend	1
Does one have to really wonder why this game imprisons lives?  It rouses a fixation, depriving sleep and razing all signs of the munchies.  Advance Wars is a portable cart aimed as a tactical knock off and effectively whops the target.  Nintendo yanks out a total hit with a chronic twist.  Their multiplayer and extremely balanced Turn-Based combat has players coming back for more and more.  The replay value on this life-draining bastard is the forerunner of its class.  Either played during sessions in school, on the passenger side, with a group of aspiring Commanding Officers, or accompanied with a pungent beverage in solitude, Advance Wars scores sky-high. Igniting in robust complexity, once the battle intricacies are soaked into your instinct the game goes ka-boom!  Lodge fortitude, play through it and soon you'll see why so many have fallen for this sweet sucker.  Before the true mayhem crops up, you are launched into guided exercises.  Avoiding the crash course, newbies will acquire the essential arts for the GBA's first warfare.  Subsequent to the training missions, the player should be ready for the maximized Campaign Mode.  Centered on Turn-Based battle, the essential goal throughout the game is taking out Commanding Officers or seizing their command centers.  Wrangled on land, air, and sea, the amazing part of the game is the perfectly balanced units.  All 18, outfitted with certain stamina points, armor, movement, attack range, and accuracy, are regularly used and maintain a purpose on the frontlines.  The infantry units, while naturally deleted off the screen, are the only ones who can annex cities that are used to accrue units.  One's surroundings (mountains, forest, reefs, highways, etc.) accomplish tactical implements as well as defense, subterfuge, or greater mobility.  Operations in the Campaign Mode are ranked depending on the players speed and technique.  AW coins, used to purchase extra maps, are awarded upon the player's performance.  Moneyed with a winning single-player campaign, and the option to directly replay all the missions, Advance Wars can stand alone as a standalone buffet.  Things just take-off with its cargo of customization traits and its several other modes.  But the unfeigned incentive to protectively hold onto the GBA is the multiplayer mode.  Enabling an up-to-four-player mode and trade with customized maps, Advance Wars coaxes as a spotless multiplayer pleasure. They're pixilated and they may be the state of primitive cartoon animation, but looks can deceive, for Advance Wars doesn't behave as it appears.  A downright, every bit of tactical thinking game, the graphics are wonderful except for the overly childish atmosphere.  Tidy and viewed overhead on a large battlefield, the tiny GBA screen shines with clear-sailing sight.  The animated, no-frills cutscenes shown when units strike each other are nice for the first 30 minutes, but swamps the game in the 31st minute.  Thank you Nintendo for the option to deactivate them.  With feisty visuals and appropriately incorporated audio, you cannot go wrong with the quality. When confined into detention, jaded to death, or suffering from the gritted-teeth addiction, Advance Wars somehow materializes into my head and mysteriously onto my palms.  Levels are designed so intelligently that the action is continuously ardent, and sometimes human competition can get pretty gripping with all the sticky sweat-works.  Greatly composed, unproblematic when learnt, and every bit full of tactical grandeur, this baby is done in superiority over all others.  Its solo-player playability and its multiplayer bonanza earns its strips and undying longevity.  Boil everything down and what you catch is a grand slam and myself roaring in chock-full acclaim.	1
Product came to me exactly as its shown and fully working was a bit scared to because of the reviews but i took the risk and got what i ordered	1
Ohhhhh yess.  This game caught me completly by suprise.  I had read some of the other reviews talk about it before i got it but nothing prepared me for just how cool this game is. First off you are on of the CO (Commanding Officer i think) in the Orange Star Army.  You are basically trying to run the Blue Army out of your territory, which of course comes down to warfare.  There are a many units to choose from from infantry, tanks, battle copters, to huge battleships.  Each CO you play as has special powers such as andy's hyper repair (which adds 2 health to all units) and max's firepower increaser (forgot the name).  The fighting is turn - based, but never slows down. To tell the truth the only strategy game that is as good as advance wars is starcraft.  This is basically a console game packed in a handheld package.  Highly addictive, and the one must have GBA game.	1
I was in disbelief of how good this game could actually be from the screen shots. Both the action and graphics are like a cartoon (Japan made it why not?), and second an entire battle is held in one single screen. Each of these things make it perfect for all ages, this is a strategy much like Chess with a twist of Final Fantasy to keep your interest. You are the general of the orange army defending in several battles against the blue army. You being the general means that you have a strategy in your mind and you order the troops what to do, and you watch the fighting, not control the fighting. The game has a very diverse assortment of infantry, tanks, ships, helicopters, planes anti-aircraft artillery and troop transporters (by land, air and sea). The game starts and you must undergo an interesting, informative and fun tutorial that lets you play as it teaches you, before the game really lets you play, with several modes, a campaign which is the game itself, war room, which has war games to see how high you score, verses mode to take on your friends, and even a design mode to design your own map and battle! The game is incredible for young and old, with great variety to keep people playing forever.	1
The following is a mini-preview brought to you by Nintendorks, Brandon DeHart, and the letter Q: "Advance Wars has baptised me into a true GBA believer. I now see the GBA as a console--a game system to sit down with in my home and play videogames. The fact that I can take it with me is now just an added perk, whereas before that was its entire purpose. Even after Castlevania, Mario Kart, Dodge Ball, and more, it was Advance Wars that made me see the light about how the GBA can compete with my N64, GameCube and PC as a prime-time videogame-playing machine. Thank you, Intelligent Systems. So what's the game all about? Well, it's a turn-based strategy game; that's as good a place to start as any. Think rock-paper-scissors meets chess, but with tanks and fighter jets, and you'll start to get the idea. You command an army of troops, and use those troops to either capture your opponent's headquarters, or wipe out the enemy troops completely--either one will win the battle for you. There's a bit more to that, of course. Scattered across the map are cities which you can capture. Capturing cities gives you more money at the start of each turn, which allows you to build more and/or better troops. Some units can't be built until a certain building is under your possession. You can't build bombers or submarines unless you have an airport or sea port under your control, for example. The battles are just as fun to watch as they are to plan. When two units clash, you're treated to a great split-screen battle where each unit fires onto the other, and destroyed units explode off the screen. There's also the nice CO expressions of glee or disgust in the corners of the screen, depending on how well or poorly his or her unit did in the battle. And if you sense a long, epic battle ahead of you, you can turn off various animations to make turns go by quicker. The anime style of graphics that runs though Advance Wars works perfectly, and even the little things like weather effects and menu screens are top notch--not to mention the cool graphics and animation when a CO uses his or her special move. The sound effects and music are on par with the graphics as well. Granted, bullet fire and explosions aren't the most intricate of sound effects in a game. Each CO has his or her own musical theme which makes each turn a bit more fun--when you hear your CO's theme fire up at the beginning of your turn, you know it's time to bring the pain. Other than Worms, I've never been a big turn-based strategy fan, especially when compared to the fast-action real-time strategy of StarCraft. So I should give the obligatory statement of "If you absolutely hate turn-based strategy, Advance Wars may not be for you." Because that's all Advance Wars is: turn-based strategy. However, it's brilliant and fun turn-based strategy with more replay value than you could possibly ask for. This isn't boring turn-based strategy where you spend 15 turns setting up your troops to fight the inevitable battle, no sir. By about your third turn in an Advance Wars battle, you're already fighting, and it only gets more hectic and fun from there. Throw in the bucket-load of options and play modes, and Advance Wars will be in your GBA for a very long time. Intelligent Systems put so much thought and detail into every little aspect of this game that it screams perfection. Well, that may be a bit too bold--Advance Wars isn't the perfect game, but it could very well be the perfect Gameboy Advance game."	1
This game has a great multiplayer, and a great oneplayer story line but this game is amazingly hard. it is easy at first but then it gets really hard i am stuck on mission 6 of the regular game. so if you are looking for a easy war game to beat this isn't it. but if you want a challange compleeting a game i sugest you invest in a GBA if you don't have it or invest in this game because it is great.	1
i needed three memery cards to do the yugioh copy cards trick i got three of every card	1
Am very happy with this product. I can now play PS1 games and save them on my PS2 game counsol. Thank you so very much!!	1
This is a nice memory card but it does not hold that much. Yes it is old and made for the psone but most people had allot of games so u cant put allot on this one. It is made by sony so it is the best brand to buy but it should have been much bigger. If i were u i would either buy two of them or get a bigger one.	1
I am not one who writes a lot of bad reviews - I think I am fairly easy to please.  I love playing computer games and I don't need fancy graphics to make me happy.  I am also a HUGE Survivor fan, so of course someone bought me this game as a gift when it came out. I played it for a few hours, and it was a complete waste of time.  I can deal with the crappy graphics, but gameplay itself is just boring.  You walk around camp and talk to people, but the conversations make absolutely no sense.  The person will tell you they hate someone in one sentence, then the next sentence they will tell you you're crazy for wanting to vote that same person off.  The computer AI also seems to automatically go for you during the votes, no matter what.  I played probably 30 different times and each time if I didn't win immunity, I got voted off first or second. The immunity challenges are somewhat fun, but there is very little variety so I got bored of them quickly.  The voting is kind of fun, if you have immunity!  Otherwise, be prepared for a quick "Game Over!" I can see how making a game of the show would be difficult - the entire show is about human relationships which are hard to adequately present in a computer game.  Anyways, this game is a waste of money.  It's quite simply not FUN.	-1
Like many- I am a huge survivor fan and was very excited to get this game, but i was disappointed in the actual game play- there is too much repetition- in the mini games, dialogue etc.  It is nice to revisit old fan favorites and play along using characters you already know..but be warned, this software has a bug that makes installtion hard and keeps kicking me out and onto the desk top..Take my advice, and vote this game out of the tribe!!  Immediately	-1
My wife is the "Survivor" freak and I got this game thinking it would get her involved with me and gamming (and the price was right at the time). Well she played it for like 20 minutes and the game never came up in conversation again. What a bad idea. In hind sight, the game publisher should have paid me to play the game and think I would have thrown it back at them. AI is hard to get right in any game, but this game set a new standard in REALLY STUPID AI. While in camp mode, your supposed to walk around, conduct tasks, talk to tribe members and influence their decisions while making alliances. It never mattered what you did in camp, it made absolutly no difference in the rest of the game. The challenges were just too stupid and repetative to list. You could make it to the end of this game in one sitting because winning immunity was that easy. The graphics were terrible. The sound was terrible. Overall, just a terrible game. You will not surive this if you buy it.	-1
I can't emphasize that enough-EVEN A DIEHARD SURVIVOR FAN WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME! I was severely disappointed. Loving Survivor, I expected the game to involve more strategy and conversation. This game could've been a best seller, but Wizard Works blew it. First of all, the game is poorly put together. After about 5 hours of gameplay--4 of those 5 hours in which I was bored, the game broke. I have a new computer Windows 2000 and I was really mad that I spent [money] on this game and it broke within a few days. It wouldn't load the game up. Now I'm going to give you my reasons for buying and not buying this game. Poor Graphics. The Conversations with other teamates are bland and the other computer-played characters respond with the same strange responses over and over. It is IMPOSSIBLE to hold an understandible coversation with them! The Voting system is hard to understand. The reward/immunity challenges are always the same bland, old thing. If you win a reward challenge, the reward is the same. Voting out another person and winning is fun for about--an hour. To conclude, this game turned to be nothing to talk about. Coming from a simulation game LOVER and one who has a fascination with Survivor, don't get this game.	-1
..fun is fun whether the game's done in 32, 64, or 128 bit. Advance Wars is a turn based, not real time, strategy war game. Kinda of feels similar to a war campaign version of Vandal Hearts. Definitely fun. There are alot of units that you'll get to use such as copters and planes to subs and cruisers. Each one has their own distinct strengths and weaknesses. You really have to pay attention to this as it does definitely play a part in your strategy as you don't want to end up with a unit next to an enemy air unit but it has no anti air capabilities. Terrain and some weather also play a part in the capabilities of your units in battle. I also found the use of bases and mobile refueling units to stock up on fuel and ammo an interesting addition as you have to pay attention to that factor as well. Or else, you're going to have a useless piece of metal with no ammo or a plane with no fuel that will actually crash. Yeah, this definitely is no kid's game as the Amazon review says. You're gonna have to think a bit which is fine by me. I like long games and am growing tired of these new "graphics intense" games that only last a couple of hours and leave you feeling lacking.	1
All I have heard are good things about this game but that is not what I thought.  If you really like war this will probably be one of your favorites, but if not it will get really repetitious.  All you do is fight war after war after war. It got very boring very quick for me.  The good point is that you can build your own maps to fight wars on but you can only store up to three.	-1
woah. by far the one of the best games made. ever. don't let the cartoon animation fool you. this game was amazing. sound-amazing. the sounds are some of the best ever. while the battle scenpes get kind of annoying, nothing is perfect, but this game is the closest to it. the training at the beginning of the game was great, too. this game was hard, but not too hard. I would highly reccomend buying this game for anyone. merry christmas. -GamerXXXXXX	1
Advance Wars is an addictive turn-based strategy game, with a comprehensive tutorial and a variety of game modes: single player campaign, single player, multiplayer mode where you pass the GBA from player to player after each turn, linked 1-4 multiplayer "VS." using one cartridge with more vs. maps available for multi-cartridge linked multiplay. Progress through missions and you are awarded coins that allow you to unlock additional parts of the game by purchasing maps.  You can also design maps with a built-in map editor, and these maps can be traded with other players via the link cable. The graphics are detailed, bright, and easy to scan.  The interface is minimalist and keeps clutter to a minimum.  This game is the "killer app" that should get you to buy a GBA if you don't already have one. Load up on batteries.	1
Advance Wars is brilliant - an exceptionally clever game that fits the Game Boy Advance the same way that Tetris fit the original Game Boy years ago.  Turn based strategy games have rarely been as accessible as Advance Wars.  The game features thoughtful tutorial that briskly walks you through the basics and quickly begins teaching you the real strategy of how to use your units, the terrain, and your commanding officer's special powers to win the day. Advance Wars has many features to keep gamers playing long after they should.  There's a campaign mode of around 20 missions to complete, war room challenges, map designing, and multiplayer mode so you can play with a group of friends with only a single GBA and cartridge. This is by far the best handheld game created for the GBA and easily one of the best titles released in 2001.  Anyone who enjoys a thoughtful strategy game now and then should put Advance Wars on their short list of games to check out. -Scott-	1
Advance Wars for the GBA is an excellent game period.  Not simply an excellent game for a handheld, but an excellent game period.  The game features a simplistic design that inexperienced players can pickup on, but one that challenges even the best turn based strategy game players.  The game starts out with a tutorial mode (Field Training) that teaches the fundamentals of the game mechanics.  After leaving the tutorial mode, one can start playing the Campaign mode where players fight it out in a minimum of 17 missions with the possibility of playing in 22.  In addition to the campaign mode, the game features a War Room where players can play on a wide variety of maps thay have purchased from winning stages in the Campaign mode.  Other added features are a Vs. mode to play against your friends and even a link mode for everyone to keep their own GBA's and hack it out.  This game has almost infinite replay value with over 120 maps to play on and an added bonus of being able to create ones own maps from scratch.  For anyone interested in strategy games or simply a good game altogether this game is a must buy.	1
I have played and own many GBA games, looking for the best to buy. Try this game if you are like me-you will not need to look any further. A very, very, very advanced chess, yet so easy to understand. Great characters and storyline. This is already a definite great classic. Parents may wonder about "Mild Violence". Don't worry-EVERYTHING has mild violence nowadays...everything your child plays. If it doesnt say "Mild" though, that's when you get concerned. Also concerning ratings-don't worry about "Comic Mischief". Its the sort of thing you see on Looney Tunes.	1
...The Ai is like a log.  It has horrible challenges.  The multiplayer ...  Tribal council is lame.  You can't even make alliances.  I don't get it, who would want this interactive ...  Even hardcore survivor fans wouldn't want this piece ...  Let's hope markaysas is better.  I mean Magic Lantern has like 20 developers.  Don't get it!!	-1
... You can't start alliances they never listen!  They just randomly vote and say stuff!!!!    The graphics are sooooooooooo poor!  It's laughable!  Oh, and if you get voted off after the merge you don't get to be in the jury!  You even play the same challenge VER and OVER again!    Youe ven don't build shelter!!!!  Here's what you do Walk around and talk to people who randomly say stuff next reward challenge that doesn't matter then immunity then tribal council.  In tribal council you just vote.  They don't dramatize it, Jeff doesn't ask you anything the CPU randomly vote!   I gave it a 2 because it's so pathetic it's funny!    I would reccomend this to canibalistic clouns, Party going monkeys and fools.	-1
Let me say I LOVE the Survivor TV show. So Infogrames or whatever the heck they call themselves released this game, I eagerly bought it. Too bad I didn't realize the game was fun for about five minutes. The computer is inconsistent, pathetic, dumb, and downright boring to talk to. The "challenges" are easy, boring, and quite bland. Even the screenshots are misleading. You see a screen with everyone sitting around the campfire. I never ONCE saw that in the game, and I got to after the merge. What B.S! The advertisements are misleading- STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! Sorry Infogrames, you blew it.	-1
Survivor has been one of my favorite television shows since it debuted nearly two years ago. The combination of physical survival and societal survival really appealed to me, and thought a computer game could be potentially awesome... not this one! When you start playing, you're given the option to choose which edition of survivor to play, but the only one available is Australian Outback. Then, you choose how long of a game you want and who you want to be. Then you begin the "survival period." You're supposed to hurry to pick which task you want to do, but the computer does them all so there's really no point to this at all. Instead, the point of survival period is to chat with your fellow survivors. Nevermind that the dialogue is derivative, stupid, repetitive, and sometimes downright full of non-sequiters. This is how you build alliances and get people voted off. Unfortunately, you have no way to influence your "allies." One second they'll tell you Colleen has got to go, and the next second they'll vote Rudy off. You can tell them to please vote for Jenna, but they'll vote for B.B. regardless. This really limits the fun factor when you're just hoping they don't feel like voting YOU off. Then, after a 3-minute survival period, you do a reward challenge. These will be dumb games like shooting arrows at boring targets, answering repetitive questions about the outback (which reappear way too quickly), and stupid races where you click arrows to indicate effort and then click them down once your player begins to get fatigued. This is about the level of a 1982 arcade game, if that. Then, whoever wins gets a physical and mental boost, which makes you better in later reward challenges (yay) and more points to allocate toward other survivors. It's here that you choose who you like and dislike. Nevermind that your ratings don't have to match with someone else's at all. After another survival period (it's at this point you'll begin to realize all of the dialogue can be whipped through in two minutes, and you're going to keep hearing "I think I should take a breather" for another 12 episodes) you finally vote people off. After a long, boring, and dull video sequence, you finally vote whoever you want off. Of course, chances are half of the other people will vote someone else out of the tribe. Then, you get to do it all over again. Sound like fun? No? If you're a fan of survivor, wait until it's in the bargain bin ([amt]), and if you're not a fan, avoid this game like the plague.	-1
Sure, the graphics and themes definitely make the game more like "Cute Wars" but working such a sophisticated simulation into a little handheld is definitley advanced. There's a lot to learn about moving your little battle pieces around the campaign maps, but Commanding Officer Nell is ready to teach you all the maneuvers and give you hyper-cute winks when you do a good job and score an A!  The game features a wonderful battery save system that lets you stop on any turn and return to your machinations. Thoughtful, delightful, challenging, and did I mention cute?  This game is the best so far on the Game Boy Advance.	1
What can I say This is my favorite game on gba it has great grapics when you go to thew battle screen and the guns sound really good this is like a cross of final fantasy 7 (turn based fighting) and warcraft war stratigy type games this game involves a lot of stratigy to win for instance if you have soldiers attack from the mountains they'll do more damage then they would from the ground and there will be less deaths because the eviorment is also something you must know about to win the war i this game is so great i can't begin to explain SO GO BUY IT AND MAKE IT NUMBER 1 ON THE LIST!!	1
Works great on.my ps 2 pal!	1
Awesome thanks!	1
I am a fan of the Survivor Series, but this game doesn't do it justice though it's not as bad as advertised. You have your choice of which tribe you want to be and which tribe you want to play against. You can either play as one of the Survivors from the TV show or you can make your own custom character. When the game starts, you see some pretty good shots that are from the TV show and you see the real characters when they go fo mail and stuff like that. But then the game gets a little tough too swallow. You have around 3 1/2 to 4 minutes to "talk" to the other characters. It's basically the same questions over and over. Then you have the reward challenge. Some of the challenges are Ok, but most are just stupid. After that, then you go back to "talking" again. Then you do the immunity challenge. If you lose, you vote someone off. There is no way to speed up any of these processes. You have to suffer through some very tedious and boring aspects of this game. The graphics of the characters and of the landscape around you aren't very good and the AI (artificial intelligence) in the game is horrible. I had 3 people in my tribe that I gave weak emotional energy to and talked bad about them and they still thought we had an alliance. A tribe member will say that you should watch yourself and you ask what have you heard and they say not much. That's it. And during the challenges, you can't even see what the other tribe scored or how close to winning they are in most of them. And the internet play, you might as well forget it. I thought it would be fun to play over the internet but because the game doesn't have anyone supporting it, it's nearly impossible find anyone playing it. Now, this game isn't a total waste as it was amusing for a short time and the price is respectable, but they should've put this game together alot better than they did. I'm dissapointed, but at least it amused me for a few hours.	-1
I reviewed this literally hours after I bought it and gave it raves. I was still in the (exhaustive) training mode and having a blast. Several dozen missions (and three sets of AA batteries) later I'm still playing but now it's about revenge. The Computer player always has more bases, more vehicles and more aircraft than you ever have. I've switched the game off mid-mission out of sheer frustration at the imbalances in this game, but ultimately I have to encourage anyone who enjoys a challenge to buy this game immediately. It's worth it for those times when you've finally got the computer on the run and are beating it's brains out and you'll love every minute of that!	1
Some of these reveiws seem really 'seeded'.  Comparing this game to Red Alert is a bit of a stretch.  This is for the most part a copy of the console turn based classic Miltary Maddness and suffers the same problem.  The AI is predictable.  You know for the most part where and how it is going to move and attack.  The AI also 'cheats'.  Things like fog of war do not affect it and make those battles frustrating.  The AI will tend to always have more troops than you which makes playing those maps with another player very one sided.  Do no get me wrong.... I tend to judge portable games on the amount of time it kills without being boring.  Advance Wars is a time eater and lots of fun in the process and very long.  Good game for a trip or sitting around.	1
Advance Wars is exactly what I've been waiting for. This game is designed by console developers (same team that has been responsible for all the Metriod titles) taking major elements of PC real-time strategy games such as Command & Conquer, and fusing them with a simple user interface and console style graphics and gameplay. Although I draw the Command & Conquer comparison, Advance Wars is not a real-time strategy game. It is in fact (for the most part) turn-based strategy, but a great game with lots of action no less. Of all the GBA titles I've tried (which is roughly all the games released in the US so far), Advance Wars is the one title I keep comming back to. Highly recommend.	1
Normaly they work great accept the two I got from Excess Source which are not meant to work on the US PS2 as they are meant for the Japanese version. Anyone who wants to play PS1 games on a PS2 will need PS1 memory cards. Please check the back of them to make sure that they have English writing on them.	1
It's a perfect fit! Thanks...	1
Excellent	1
Works Perfect!	1
i have this for the ps2 and it works well, i bought it used for 3.99 which isn't bad. i can easily save all my ps1 games and i can easily delete the saves i don't want anymore.	1
The thing about authentic products (chiefly the PSX Sony memory cards)is that while you do indeed pay for the name, your also paying for a product with the fewest bugs and flaws. In the case of off brand memory cards, the issue was frequent memory crashes or corrupted files. This is not so much a problem when you purchase the Sony lisenced card for the Sony console. For some strange and frustrating reason, when the PS2 slim design was unveiled to the public, only a handful of 3rd party memory cards were compatable. Rest assured that the Sony lisenced PSX cards WOULD be one of the few names that would work. I reccomend this particular card out of any other just for the sake of simplicity and ease of access.	1
I received a Playstation memory card as a birthday present in July 1996. Unfortunately, one year later I started seeing that everything was going 3D, and that was the preferred choice among most gaming fans because everyone wanted realism, and me, growing up with the Super NES, wanted the PSX to continue having 2D games. It didn't turn out that way, and I decided in 1997 that video games were something I didn't need to bother with anymore.  Warp ahead to 2005. I want to go back and discover old games I had missed the first time around. It turns out I missed a LOT of good games. First of all, here's the games I had from 1996-1999 (yeah, I continued to buy games after 1997, but not that many)-  - Crash Bandicoot (the first one)  - Mortal Kombat Trilogy  - Mortal Kombat 3  - Loaded  - Road Rash  - WWF Wrestlemania: Arcade Game  - WWF In Your House  - Syphon Filter  - Dino Crisis  - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night  That was it. Back then I thought for certain Mortal Kombat Trilogy would go down as the best fighter of all-time. Funny stuff! I also thought Loaded and Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game would be considered classics, too. I had NO idea that Castlevania game would still be considered popular in the year 2007. Owning that game when it came out was the best decision I made back then.  That means I missed out on such wonderful, influential games like the Resident Evil series, Silent Hill, Medal of Honor, Metal Gear Solid, Dino Crisis 2, Crash Bandicoot 2 and 3, a whole bunch of RPG's, the Spyro series, the Mega Man Legends series (including X4) and a lot more.  I have to be honest with you- I'm really glad I discovered these games in the year 2005-2007 (and I'm not done) because if I had gotten into them back when they first came out, memories of high school (I hated it with a passion) would have caused a distraction and a lingering feeling in the back of my head sparking memories I'd rather forget. I was in high school from '96-2000. Those were important years in the life of the Playstation. It was good to get away from gaming back then.  So I'm happy I cleared my head and bought a bunch of fresh classics the last couple years. Even that Castlevania game sparks memories I'd rather forget. Luckily, nothing lasts forever, and the memories are starting to fade so I can approach those games I originally bought (and received) in a clear-minded light. However, if I DIDN'T have to go to high school, I'd love to go back and experience some of these games for the first time. Especially Silent Hill. Probably my favorite PSX game at the moment.	1
This is a great game!!!  If you are looking for something that combines elements of a puzzle game (like tetris or lemmings) with a strategy game (like worms or a variety of PC games) you have found it.  The games graphics are perfectly suited and are nice and brite, which is nice given  the dark screen.  The games difficulty ramps quite nicely and you will never feel lost if you just go through the training mode.  The save function is perfect and allows you to play for just a couple moments between saves.  It even has a multiplayer link option.  I usually give great games 4 stars since they often lack originality -- not here.  There is nothing else like it and it will probably remain a staple for your GBA for years.	1
As far as I know, Advance Wars is the first title to be released in the USA from a popular series of turn-based strategy games that has been around in Japan since the days of the old NES. Being a lover of all types of strategy games, from Final Fantasy Tactics (my all-time favorite) and Ogre Battle 64, to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, I was really looking forward to popping this pak into my GBA. But I wasn't expecting it to be of this caliber. At first glance, the colorful graphics of Advance Wars look simple, but I was somewhat impressed by the look of the battle sequences. It's nice to see that the artists took the time to design all types of different battle sequence backgrounds, such as a forest background when your troops attack from the trees, and a river background when they launch an assault from the water. The effects of gunfire and the blades on a battle copter whipping around sound pretty good, and there's an assortment of music that changes from turn to turn depending on which characters the player(s) or computer has chosen to play as. Once again, it's nice that the creators put together several pieces of music instead of leaving one monotonous track to do the job. But with the good comes the bad. The storyline, though it somewhat develops the characters and provokes you to continue your campaign battle-to-battle, can get kind of stupid when, say...your advisor happens upon her ex-boyfriend. Advance Wars is packed with modes, but first you'll have to complete Field Training. This is where you'll be taught how to play, which is good since the book doesn't fully explain all there is to know. You won't be taught in a matter-of-fact way, but instead are presented with a more pleasant, hands-on approach, where your advisor slowly welcomes you to all the different army units, terrain types, and so on, as you engage in little mini-wars. There are two other single-player modes: Campaign is the main game that takes you through the story as you fight off invading armies, and War Room gives you a high score depending on how well you fight (how fast the battle was completed, how many of your units were lost, etc.); it can be fun to come back later or invite your friends to the War Room to challenge your high score. And of course, there are the multi-player Versus Mode (also single-player) and Link Mode. (Versus is played by having players pass around one GBA.) Both modes (multi-pak for Link Mode) allow you to choose from over 100 maps, but unlike Versus Mode, Link Mode doesn't let the computer take the place of the third or fourth player, so if you want to play cooperatively against the CPU on multiple GBAs, you're out of luck! Even if it did have this functionality, Link Mode is no different than Versus Mode except that you don't have to reach that full foot or two to pass the GBA to your friend. So if you think you need more than one game to get all the great multi-player options, you can probably save your money and get just one. Perhaps most exciting of all, there's a great map editor that lets you design your own battlefields for play in Versus and Link Modes. You can virtually make a map that is as good as, if not better than, the programmer-designed ones since you are given every object of terrain and every building that is in the actual game to work with. Now that's an edit mode! When you actually get down to waging war, the gameplay will seem complex at first since there are so many things to take into account, but after a day or two, you'll be spotting all the traps and making all the most strategic moves possible. First you'll have to acquaint yourself with all 18 war units. For instance: you'll learn that, while mechanized infantry have more destructive power than ordinary infantry, infantry can move three spaces per turn while the mechs can only move two; then again, it counts as two spaces for infantry to cross over mountains while it only counts as one for mechs. You'll also learn that certain units can only attack certain other units -- maybe only ground units, maybe only ships, or maybe a mixture of both. It gets even more complicated when you have to drive the APC over to give units more ammunition or refuel vehicles. Then there's the terrain which units can use for coverage. Say you spot enemy infantry on the plains; since plains only offer and added defense of one while mountains provide an extra four defense, an attack sprung from the highlands would score more damage while suffering less from the counter-attack than one sprung from the plains. Troops can get even more coverage if Fog of War is toggled on. This feature disables the player from viewing enemy troops until they come into the vision range of one of his units. Forests provide still further concealment, with only units directly adjacent to the treeland terrain being able to peer into its depths. I've only just scratched the surface of Advance Wars and could go on telling more forever, but I am limited to 1,000 words. With so many modes and so many ways to play them, plus the infinite possibilities of the edit mode, suffice it to say you'll have your hands tied until...well, forever as long as your friends prove challenging enough to keep you strategizing. In my mind, in a matter of two weeks Advance Wars successfully dethroned Mario Kart. If any GBA title ever wishes to top this game, it's going to have to wage a brutal war.	1
I got what i needed and am thankful of Amazon supplying it for me.	1
Not a original PS2 cable but still a no e cable and works fine.	1
Great buy	1
GREAT GAME!! Deep and complex for a Game Boy Advance Game... not to mention up to 4 players on one GBA or use of links. I'm still just playing the 'training mode' so as u can see if the training mode is already fun, imagine playing with 4 friends. This game is probably one of the few reasons to buy a GBA along with Castlevania: COTM and some others. A MUST HAVE.......... get it while its still available!!	1
great!	1
works :D	1
I don't think getting the official is that serious for something as simple at this cord. So buy it if you're feeling nostalgic to play games that don't involve membership, internet (not anymore), and constant friend requests from creepy guys, and achievement hunting. Dust your PS2 off, use this cord, and have some old school fun.	1
Anyone who has kept track of the Bomberman games since the beginning knows well that the gameplay has changed little over the years. Perhaps it's for the best however, because there's no need to mess with classic gameplay unless it needs fixing. Bomberman Online features all of the multiplayer fun of the previous Bomberman games plus a couple of new modes. For those unfamiliar with Bomberman, it's a puzzle/strategy game with simple but addicting gameplay. The basic goal is to lay bombs to trap and destroy your opponents on a semi-2D screen in a maze-like atmosphere. The most notable new features included in Bomberman Online are: updated 3D graphics, cell-shaded cinemas, online gameplay, character customization, and several new gameplay modes. While the single player mode may get boring after a while, the real meat of Bomberman Online lies within the multiplayer battles. I strongly recommend it to those looking for a good multiplayer game for the Dreamcast that anyone can get into.	1
cable was good	1
Just what I needed for a couple system only PS2s I bought.	1
Very inexpensive cord would reccomend to everyone that needs a playstation 2 card .works great and came in mail very fast	1
I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to hook up my PS2. Sadly, when I found the power cord, it had been shredded by our rabbit. I bought this new one and it works like a dream!	1
Good, but honestly haven't tried it yet. if not I can always buy another one. other than that the packaging was great.	1
this actually came to me days before the Estimated date and I'm pleased that it does what it's meant to do!! thanks	1
Works like it should and didn't give me any problems. If you need. A ps2 cable buy this... Yes... I need more words	1
I found a PS2 in the trash, yes the trash, and this was all that was missing. So for price of a power cord, I got a new PS2!	1
Not too much that one can say about a cable. When it boils down to it, it either works or it doesn't. This one worked.	1
Thank you for your product	1
This game is packed with content and replay ability, and takes full advantage of what the gameboy has to offer. If you only buy one gba game, make it this one!	1
I got this game because I really needed a new game for my GBA. At first the contols felt so super weird I eventually got used to them and now it's fun!	1
This game did a lot of things right.  First of all, most reviews of this game say that it mixes elements from Mario Kart for SNES and Mario Kart 64.  It is definitely more closely related to the SNES version, which I loved.  Not only are there 20 initial tracks, but what I like is that you can unlock more tracks by winning the cups.  In Mario Kart 64 you couldn't unlock anything at all!  So then you win all of the cups, and after you beat all 5, then you go through all of the cups again, this time with the focal point being collecting coins but still racing.  I love that!	1
Looking for a cycle game with lots of speed an action? Then you need to check out this game! Set in the distant future, racing corporate sponsored futuristic cycles on insanely looped tracks against other cycle teams at blistering speeds! Now add turbo boost, a couple of rocket launchers mounted on your bike, and a bigger badder engine to break the sound barrier, which by the way is a nice touch in which everything just goes silent, and now you have a death machine on two wheels to literally blow away the competition! You earn credits by placing in the race and then are able to upgrade your bike. Controls take a little getting used to and you may have to reconfigure the buttons until you feel comfortable. Graphics are awesome if you got the time to look at them, as you are often to busy focusing on the track and the other bikers trying to blow them out the way. Only complaint I had was there is no instant replay like in Gran Turismo 3, but other than that this game is right on! I would of liked a little more customization such as choosing colors of bikes, perhaps maybe different models, some suspension parts, and engine upgrades as well as more weapon selection. Even customize the driver, oh well maybe next time. Overall its a great game guaranteed to have you glued in front of the TV for hours!	1
Personally, the N64 didn't impress me at all.  I bought one very late in the life of the sys - about the time the first Zelda came out.  And to this day, I only own a few games for the system, and two of those are from the beloved Extreme-G series.  The first installment boasted super-fast racing and colorful, smooth graphics.   The second game surprisingly was incredibly better with fast curving tracks and the implementation of an incredibly cool, if not graphically impressive, effect where if you go past the speed of sound in your speed bike, the game goes silent after a sonic boom.  All music and sound effects are cut off, giving an incredibly cool effect.  The only thing holding the series back was the fuzzy N64 graphics and terrible draw distance.    So, when the third came out without any hoopla or mass media advertising, I noticed it came just as the other two did for me.  All of a sudden, it was there on the shelf.  I immediatly picked it up and was dazzled from the minute I put the DVD in the drive.   Based around inredibly fast motorcycle-like racers with shields and armed with weapons, you race around a track at blazing speeds up to and passing 1000 mph!!  The shield and weapon effects are perfect excuses for Acclaim to add tons of light and particle effects.  When you hit a wall at 700 mph, your shield glows a luminescant green in the portion that it hit, slowing you down.  And, at first, you will be hitting a lot of walls.   The trademark roller-coaster type tracks that go straight up, twist, and loop completely around are all included.  Tight turns and drops are everywhere, and take a little getting used to, after playing a game like GT3.  The draw distance is  incredible; some loops you see miles away.  It really has the effects of a fast rollercoaster ride through desert, city, and icy landscapes, as well as one set entirely above and below water.  Acclaim really used the PS2's graphical power for this one, and it shows.   The power-up system is based on your placing in the races.  Instead of the pick up in the race method of the previous installments, you have to earn money in races, just as in GT3.  There are about 10 weapons and numerous upgrades to your basic engine.  No refinement on your vehicle, though, it is just straightforward buying a faster engine.  Weapons range from a shield absorber to a vulcan cannon, and all are quite impressivley visualized.   The music is perfect for this type of game.  Fast techno beats drive you as you hit the insane speeds of the game.  With big name groups and each track having it's own song, they are varied enough for even the non-techno fan.   This game is incredibly fast, with the regular amount of cheat codes as with most Acclaim games, so there is no reason not to pick this one up.  The tracks are worth the price alone, and seem to whip you around like crazy.  Put anyone with a queezy stomach in front of the TV for this one, and you'll regret it.  This game is definitely worth the price.	1
Extreme G-3 is perhaps the biggest surprise of the year, at least for me. After playing the first and second ones (both were only mediocre), I wasn't expecting anything spectacular from this installment on the PS2. But man, when I booted it up I was instantly hooked. It sports some truly amazing graphics, and the overall speed keeps you coming back for more. The framerate is excellent, even in two player mode, and there's plenty to unlock and discover. One of the best games of the year in my book, go buy it.	1
great	1

Great deal	1
Good came in good condition and worked. Not crazy about this game but it was cool to see one of the original mario karts.	1
I LOVE IT	1
Great game!	1
Amazing game, one of the best ones of the gameboy	1
i love racing games, and this one i think is much cooler than most.. you are a bullet bike and you get to add things like turbo and guns and laser beams to shoot at the guys in front of you... this is one of my favorite games to play!	1
Love this game a lot.  Just had to replace it because the old one got scratched up.	1
The game made me bored fast.  I suggest you rent it if you want to see how it is.	1
I've played Wipeout since PS1. I haven't tried Wipeout Fusion from PS2 yet but the reviews seemed to indicate that there has been little new so I decided to try this game instead- especially now that it has hit the bargain bins in most stores. XG3 is very very similar to Wipeout. Pros: Good graphics compared to PS1 Wipeout. (no surprise here.) Frame rates are very high so driving thru the more advanced tracks is quite exhilirating, once you've bought a new engine. The tracks are quite nice but I don't think you get much of a chance to enjoy the art work otherwise you'll find yourself grinding against the side of the track. You get to keep the weapons that you buy rather than use it for  a short period of time. Controls are responsive. Should probably reconfig the turbo and gas controls right away to use the shoulder buttons. Weapons are very very similar to wipeout. Machine gun, heat seeking missiles, rockets, shield enhancers, mines, ... Cons: You have to earn $ to be able to get different weapons. Wipeout lets you use them as you find them. Not sure how choosing different bikers makes any difference. The manual does not say much and there is no obvious sense of it in the game. It took me quite a bit of effort to win race 2. The hint comes at the back of the manual where it says you have to "feather" the turbo. What does that mean??? Some biker-techno-term? Turns out it means repeatedly pumping it and releasing it to get more out of your turbo. That was the only way I could catch up with the computer controlled drivers. Music in Wipeout is much much better. It's difficult to tell whether your weapons really helped. E.g. deploy the mines and expect to hear some kind of explosion like in Wipeout. Not in XG3. I think there is a sound but I'm not sure if it's an impact explosion. -------------- Overall, it is a solid Wipeout clone. If you always wanted a PS2 upgrade for your copy of Wipeout but don't want to blow 50 bucks for Wipeout Fusion, XG3 is pretty good. ...	1
If you trun all the lights off the in the room and stare at the screen hard while playing this game, you are sure to get head pains really quick thanks to lots of flashing lights and totally awsome graphics and game play. Is this a bad thing? I would not say so. The more races you win the higher levels up you go, but its the outside level that makes it worth playing and fun in my opinion. I am not a fan of racing games to much, but highly recommend you buy this or at least rent this. The reson this game gets 4 stars over 5 is because it is a little too short.	1
Seeing as 2001 was such a huge year for gaming, it makes sense that some highly worthwhile titles would get passed over.  Unfortunately, two outstanding PS2 racing games from the same company (Acclaim) suffered this fate, one being the superlative Burnout, and the other being Extreme-G 3. I can't help but think that many gamers wrote this off as a Wipeout clone, or figured it was of the same quality as the two preceding N64 games, but that's really too bad.  Yes, XG3 is in fact influenced by Wipeout, but it has enough differing elements to make it quite a worthy competitor for the title of Best Futuristic Racer.  In XG3, you race some Akira-style jet-cycles around some spectacular tracks, in a mad supersonic dash to cross the finish line.  What sets this game apart from other racers are the weapons/turbo/shield system, the unmatched sense of speed, and the vertigo-inducing, gorgeous circuits. At the outset of Career Mode, your bike (which is a dead ringer for the Lightcycles from the film Tron) is outfitted with a standard cannon and shield.  As you fly around the rollercoaster-like tracks, there are purple and green strips to drive over, which refill your ammunition and shields, respectively.  What makes the races more strategical than most is that your shield and turbo both draw energy from the same source.  Use all the energy for turbo, and you might find yourself without a shield, making you an easy target for the weapons of other bikes, and you better not hit the walls, or else.  Save all the energy for your shield, and you'll find yourself in last place pretty quickly.  This is a wonderful innovative touch that makes every race a constant chessmatch, albeit at 600+ miles per hour.  Oh yes - use your ammo wisely, or you may find yourself on an opponent's tail with no way to take him (or her) out.  I must also mention the amazing thing that happens when you break the sound barrier...but I'll leave that for you to discover yourself. The bikes handle great, but I highly recommend configuring the controls, which are completely customizable, thankfully.  I remapped the turbo and fire buttons to R1 and L1 - it works perfectly and is much more comfortable. The track designs are nothing less than beautiful, inspired, clever works that will leave your stomach in knots and your mind in awe.  Whether it be the Blade Runner-esque Astradaitoshi (complete with rain effects, full moon, and neon billboards.....and at some points the skyscrapers go horizontal!), the sunset-drenched Nuon Harbor, or my personal favorite, Oceania (with a hair-raising vertical loop - we're talking straight up and straight down here - and transparent underwater tunnels), each one is a unique and detail-filled challenge.  Yes, there are only ten tracks, but they're so diverse and magnificent it doesn't matter.  I'd rather have ten highly polished and diverse tracks - with no slowdown, even at 1000 mph - than twice that many with repetitive or mirrored tracks. As you progress through Career Mode, you earn credits which can then be spent to upgrade your bike, whether it be a more powerful engine, a high range of weapons (ranging from heat-seeking missiles to mines to an electro-magnetic pulse), or nifty items like an extra shield generator or an ammo or shield scoop, which enables you to gain an additional energy supply from the strips on the track.  You also progress through several leagues, each with its own speed class.  You end up racing the same tracks in each league, but since the speed class is upgraded each time, it's like racing them anew.  There is also a time attack mode which nets you extra credits (hint: beat the lap record for each track and watch your required finishing place drop in league races). Another interesting twist is the Two-Player Career Mode, in which you and a friend work in tandem through the circuits.  It's a very welcome cooperative feature.  There is also a more typical two-player mode, which is just as sharp as single-player, and just as fun. All told, there's a lot to like here.  The increasing difficulty of Career Mode isn't conquered easily, and the multiplayer features add a lot of gameplay.  XG3 doesn't seem to be getting quite the attention it deserves.  Its sense of speed is intoxicating, its graphics unbelievable, and its fun factor immediate and sky-high.  The sensation of traveling faster than the speed of sound never gets old.  Next to Burnout, XG3 is the best arcade-style PS2 racer to date.	1
My son loved this game.	1
Condition of the game was excellent. The item fit the description!	1
HOURS OF FUN EVEN FOR TWO	1
RATING IS NOT BASED OF GAME QUALITY, I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THE GAME: I am only reviewing this because I learned that the copy I bought off Amazon was a bootleg. I know it is a bootleg because legitimate GBA games are saved to FLASH memory on the game cart. My game started failing to save, and when I dismantled the cart, I found a watch battery on the board. Be wary that bootleggers are selling illegitimate copies of GBA games on here.	-1
Label was ripped and sometimes it doesn't work.	-1
Excellent item!	1
Product as expected	1
I like this game a lot because it's from the Mario Kart series, but I'd recommend it for real Mario Kart racers. The drift is not the easiest to control and the mechanics are a little weird. Overall, it is fun with nice course design and a cool unlockable feature that allows you to play SNES(Super Mario Kart) tracks and I strongly recommend it.	1
LOVE THIS GAME	1
Great Buy	1
Basically a sequel to the SNES Mario Kart, and looks great on a backlit GBA or DS Lite.  Lots of replayability, and even multiplayer support if you have the GBA link cable.  A must own for any GBA or Mario Kart fan.	1
Got the game and  I love it I have beaten The game several times And then several more times so you know I love the game	1
I ordered this game and it has amazing graphics. The shipping on this item was also very quick. I would  buy this again.	1
I was a bit upset that the seller said that the label was clean and intact but in reality, it was worn out and torn. The game worked but it wasn't in the condition i hoped it to be. It feels like someone had this in the basement somewhere and thought they could sell it to someone for a cheap deal. They succeded.	-1
kids go wild over this game no matter what price you charge for them but i try to keep them down	1
growing up i love old classic games and when the game itself worn out on me. i vowed to purchase the game one day and i'm still in love. :)	1
most ly i want to say the price was good worth it and it is avery challenging good game the whole family loves it really you get to play differnt characters and race which is for my son so amazing he loves both plus loves mario he is a fanatic really and we all enojoy this game	1
Don't get me wrong; I love Mario Kart! However, you sometimes meet a terrible game in a series. Mario Kart: Super Circuit is obviously no fun IMO compared to Mario Kart 7. I enjoyed Mario Kart Advance when I was younger, but now I think it's just a gimmick to show off what the Game Boy Advance could do in 2001. This game is OVERRATE just like ALL Zelda games after the Super NES announcement.	-1
As a fan of the Mario Kart series, I was anxious to finally pick up and play Super Circuit years after it's release.  I've had a ton of fun on Mario Kart Wii and its always interesting for me to go back in the past a little bit to see how the games have progressed.  First off, Super Circuit is fun.  It's a perfect portable game. The tracks are not so long as to take up too much time, yet they are long enough to not feel too cheap and tacked on for the sake of putting a Mario Kart game out.  There is a nice selection of tracks to start the game off that each require it's own type of skill to master.  Sure, as always, there is a track or two that sometimes feels unnecessarily frustrating, but the fun you have on the other tracks more than make up for it.  Once you get the hang of sliding around corners, using the jump button to control those turns and coming out of them with a nice little boost to shoot you ahead of your opponents, you'll be having all kinds of great fun.  There are a few different modes to choose from.  You can of course go for the classic Grand Prix mode with 50, 100, or 150ccs and test your mettle against your computer foes (I hate Peach). There is the Time Trial mode in which you can learn to master the tracks with no fear of being rear ended with a dreaded red turtle shell at the finish line, and then there is the Quick Run, in which you can simply load up any track you want and race against the CPU without worrying about doing an entire Cup.  Unfortunately, you need another person with a Gameboy Advance and a connector cable to play Multiplayer and since I don't have that option, I can't comment on it.  All I know is that I've heard that it is better if the other person were to have their own Super Circuit cart as well.  You can play with only one game and a connector cable if you wish, but it will limit your character selection.  Super Circuit also harkens the return of the coins from Super Mario Kart, which means that the outcome of the race will rely on skill as much as it does luck.  Whereas the newest incarnations of the Mario Kart franchise usually require an big chunk of luck (you tend to get punished for being good), you will have to collect as many coins as you can to help your speed and to keep you from spinning out each time you get hit, which will happen when you run out of coins.  Collecting coins also brings up another cool thing about the game; if you collect 100 coins in each cup after getting gold in it, it will unlock that cup from the original Super Mario Kart.  So, when all is said and done, you have the potential for unlocking another five cups for a grand total of 40 tracks to race.  Not too shabby for a portable racing game.  Honestly, I found this game to be more fun than I expected.  It's absolutely perfect for what it's intended for.  When you are out and about and have your Gameboy Advance (or DS or 3DS) with you, it's great for playing bite sized chunks at a time.  It takes very little time to compete in a cup and be done with it if that is what you wish.  On the other hand, there are enough tracks and it is enough fun that you could sit in your living room or on a road trip and play it for hours.  I recommend this game heartily for those that are fans of the Kart.	1
This is a game worth having. I've played this on the N64 but this game for Gameboy Advance is a game worth having. The gameplay is basically the same as with any Mario Kart game. While the controllers are the same its just a matter of mastering the controls.  I would've liked to know why it was so expensive just for a Gameboy advance? Really? Every person knows that Gameboy Advance is obsolete so why make a game and make it so popular and then make it so expensive? I guess companies and some people are down right greedy in this economy. But enough of that. Have fun being last. or trying to catch up and be first.	1
I got this game when I was younger and it was really fun! You get to drive go karts around and shoot item at people and all that good stuff! however since its a gamboy advance game all of the tracks are flat, no hills or banked turns. other than that the game is fun and addictive! and theres a ton of tracks to race on!	1
Mario Kart: Super Circuit is the first time the Mario Kart series came onto the Game Boy. It is also the first game in the series to have a subtitle with the actual title. Once more, it is also the first Mario Kart game to have retro courses. Don't believe me? Then skip down to the near-bottom of this review.  Instead of having the same gameplay as Mario Kart 64, however, the game uses the original Super Nintendo game's gameplay and performs a major twist in it.  The graphics are awesome. For the characters, they are taken right out of Mario Kart 64, but everything else is new and a sight for sore eyes.  You get to start with 16 courses (The Special Cup is locked). Each course seems to have their own gimmicks, with the exception of some. The courses are greatly detailed and their designs are kinda clever.  The music in the game is unlike the other Mario Kart games. Although some of the soundtrack is Mario Kart-worthy, there are several songs that doesn't fit in, yet you'd love to listen to the music. Such examples are Boo Lake, Ribbon Road, Snow Land, and the game's Rainbow Road.  When racing on a track, you'll always find coins. At first glance, they look pointless to collect. But guess what? You need them. If you have no coins and someone bumps into you, you'll spin out. What's cool about the coins is that when you finish a cup with over 100 coins, you get to unlock a cup from the original Super Mario Kart! Nostalgia just beats like a human heart right there. When you enter the Cup menu, just press L or R and then it will switch to the Super Mario Kart tracks. The graphics aren't from the Super Nintendo game, though, but the tracks still play like how they used to be.  With 20 new courses and 20 ones that were brought back, this game will last for a long while.	1
Fun game but the graphics r not as good as the 64s. It is more like the snes version for graphics anyway. I played this game all the time when it first came out. It was the only GBA game i wanted to play after a while. It has a good two player mode not many GBA games had two player. I thought the graphics were good at first untill i got the ds mario kart and i stoped playing it. Then i thought the graphics were horrible but u got to remember its the GBA and it came out in 2001. Now its 2009 and sometimes i still play it. The 64 graphics were only better because nintindo went computerized with is so it had more of unblocky graphics. But this and the snes have about the same graphics. The sound is pretty good so over all i give this game a 7.5/10 but mostly because of the graphics compared to the ds but i got to remember that it is 8 years old.	1
Great game, you can't go wrong with any of the Mario Kart series.  Time flies when I play this game!	1
THIS GAME IS THE BEST  YOU CAN PLAY ON CLOSE TO 60 TRACKS FOR A UNBEATABLE PRICE  YOU CAN ALSO UNLOCK SNES TRACKS WHEN YOU GET 100 COINS IN MARIO GP MODE  ITS REALLY FUN	1
If you're an old school gamer like me and loved Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo platform then this is the game for you.  Even if you like racing games, this is just one of those games that you MUST play, without a doubt.  It's great for all skill levels and age ranges.  You have the easy/medium/hard option (50cc, 100cc, 150cc).  There are 4 cups you can choose to race from, each having 4 courses.  So that's 16 different race tracks to get your wheels on.  And even better, when you get really good, choose the 150cc level and race in the Star Cup.  If you manage to get first place (which is EXTREMELY hard) you can unlock the Special Cup that has 4 additional tracks to race.  The game graphics are excellent.  I especially like the race courses where it's raining- it just looks very cool.  This is definitely one of my favorite games on Gameboy Advance and I highly recommend it for everyone, kids and adults alike!	1
Works well for Sony products, no problems at all. Yellow color makes it easy to track down. Highly recommended.	1
They work great	1
Mario Kart Super Circuit for Game Boy Advance is best compared to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) counterpart.  If you began liking Mario Kart with the Nintendo 64 version, then the GBA version will not live up to your expectations.  However, I have friends who prefer the SNES version; so if you are one of those, consider the GBA version an upgrade from the SNES version.  In the GBA version, the graphics are rather decent as compared to the SNES version.  The GBA system is 32-bit; and compared to the SNES (16-bit), there are more capabilities.  Your perspective is behind the racer, and the graphics flow smoothly all around your driver with a great 3D-like perspective.  The levels are quite nice, and the drivers and graphics are well-detailed.  The gameplay is a lot like the SNES version where hopping doesn't help you very much (it helps a LOT in MK64!), but it surely upgrades the item usage.  That is, you can line your shells up much better, and negotiating turns is much easier.  The action involved in the game is complimented with the Gran Prix mode where you can win tournaments.  Linking up with others, in my opinion, is the best feature of the game, hands down.  So if you like portability and you appreciate the SNES version of Mario Kart, this game will suit you nicely.  Also, if you like to play Mario Kart by yourself, this game can burn some time for you.  But if you started your Mario Kart career off with the N64 version like I did, then you will be slightly disappointed with some of the general gameplay capabilities.  (The GBA game plays nothing like the 64 version.)	-1
Out of all the Mario Kart games that's come out(including Mario Kart DS); Mario Kart Super Circuit has to be my most favorite. It takes the best parts of Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64 and mix them together to create a whole new Mario Kart experience. There's 40 tracks in all(including the original tracks from Super Mario Kart), eight characters, Grand Prix and Time Trial modes, ghost mode that saves your ghost to the game to trade with other players or for you to race against, and more. The game itself is similar to the Super Mario Kart game but with better graphical and level design, better audio, and an over-the-top presentation. One thing it does and does well is prove just how powerful the Gameboy Advance really is. It, literally, pushes the system to it's limits.  It's a game every Gameboy Advance owner should have in their collection. One I highly recommend to all.	1
I wasn't into this game yet until I got the Gameboy Advance to go with it and other games. So, this game had Super Mario Bros. 3 where you are dueling monsters from pipes. That was my favorite game, but I didn't like the kart racing that much like I used to on Nintendo 64. Because of that Nintendo 64 had something better that I liked. I just took this game for granted and played another game.	1
So you like Mario? You like the Mario Kart games? You wish you could play Mario Kart while on the road? Here is your wish: Mario Kart Advance. What a great game this one is, with new levels, sharp graphics and sound, the same characters, and massive fun. Though it is more similar to the SNES version of Mario Kart, you can not complain about this game in any way. It is hard or easy depending on the speed you play it at, and this game is just a rush...  There is one flaw with this game though that stood out to me. Whoever the first 4 players to win the first round of the series of races, are the same 4 players that will be in the top 4 the rest of the series, UNLESS you play on 150 cc , or possibly 100 cc. That aside, this is a great game, nonetheless.	1
The game is very simple.  You choose which mode you want to play, with your options being one-player, multi-player, and something called a "Ghost Exchange" that I've never tried but would guess is similar to the "Pok'emon Crystal Version" thing where you can press yours and your friend's Game Boys together and each get a gift from each other.  In one-player mode, you can choose from the mode where you race the computer, a mode where you race yourself to see how fast you can get your time, and a mode that I believe is the older set-up of "Mario Kart" (without the coins and points).  Then you choose the level of diffuculty, and pick your character (Mario, Luigi, Peach, and you know the rest.)  Afterwards, you battle it out on interesting, colorful tracks, trying to rank high and (except in the timed mode) win a trophy.  Like I said, it's simple, but it's also very addicting, and the graphics are fantastic!	1
Mine was white when it came, but if you actually care about the colour you got problems. Does what it needs to do.	1
In great shape...Color was actually white w/ blue, but that's not a big deal really.	1
clean, fast shipping. memory card is in perfect  condition. i prefer the yellow ones myself so i was happy this worked so well	1
This new version of Mario Kart is just like the Snes version, and once you've actualy beaten the game, or use a code, the original tracks from the SNES version are actualy in this game too!!!!!! Which is what makes it the best Mario Kart game ever!!!  There is loss of the Koopa turtle thing, the graphics are improved, but it's still the same great game for Mario Kart lovers!!!	1
To start off, i have never played the n64 version or the nes version, so i'm not comparing this game to those games. But mario kart super circuit is one of the best games i have ever played. Its very creative and i really like the gameplay. The idea for the game was really fun, and addicting. The charecters are all great and they all race differently. The music on this game was awesome, they had a different tune for every track! The best thing about the game is that its challenging, there are so mamy tracks to beat(once you unlock the secret ones) i still haven't finished the game and i've had it for over six months. But thats okay because it keeps me playing, and it never gets old. I think the game is well worth 30 dollars even if it is from 2001. Overall this game was definately a keeper!  Pros:  great gameplay  fun charecters  40 different tracks  items make game very fun  music is great  graphics are superb  single player or multi player  battles for multi player  addicting  challenging  Cons:  some say it doesnt match up to n64 version  may be too "cutsie"	1
Choose from Mario, DK, Bowser and five other characters and race on 20 new tracks. Race against your own best time in Time Trials, play in the grand prix ,or link up with 1 to 3 friends and play the battle mode.  With simple controls, winning gold medals isn't hard to master (with enough practice you will be able to master even the hardest level),  but there is a challenge complete. Play the grand prix, and get a total of at least 100 coins on each of the 4 courses to unlock another course. Try to complete this on 50cc, 100cc, then 150cc.  The graphics are great, and this game is VERY fun. You won't get bored of this game for a while.	1
After playing Mario Kart 64 (on the Nintendo 64), I was very disappointed to see "Mario Kart Super Circuit" basically represent a step backwards in technology.  Of course, I should have assumed this, since the GBA's 32-bit processor is only half as powerful as the Nintendo 64's. This version of Mario Kart is really more similar to the Super NES game "Super Mario Kart," which I never liked -- and I can't say I like this version much more.  You're back to the old mission of collecting coins as you race, and the coins have something to do with your speed and/or resistance to crashes.  I never really saw any major difference on how many coins you have. In any event... if you like Mario Kart 64 or the Gamecube's Mario Kart Double Dash... this game could let you down.  It's not "truly" a 3-D game.  Because the GBA screen is so small, the action moves so fast, and the "fake 3D perspective" is mediocre... it's hard to anticipate upcoming turns and obstacles.  I've always thought the turning controls were way too touchy on this and the SNES version. I also think the computer characters cheat... no matter how much of a good lead you can build at the beginning of a race, or how many speed mushrooms you use... the computer players ALWAYS catch up!	-1
Lots of people seem to think this is the best gameboy game. Well I defenitley think that its not the best but its pretty good. The good things about the game are that it has pretty good graphics and sounds. Also at first it may seem that it only has a couple track but thats not true at all. When you un-lock all the tacks theres over 20! Some of them aren't that original (the first track in the game is original but then theyll make it same background track type and add a couple of extra curves still fun though) And theres lots of characters that when you choose them youll feel like your going faster or turn worse. But the bad thing that makes it not that good to me is gameplay. The game play is good not bad by any means but its easy to get off track and ALL of the tracks are increidbly short. The longest one takes less than 3 minutes to do 3 laps. Also its very easy to win races but if you crash its hard to beat second. And most of the time you always come in second or first so theres no real good gameplay. Occasionaly you might have a barely win race but thats not likely. Yet its easy to win but when your done with a race you get a rateing (F D C B A) And its impossible almost to get an A but yet its easy to win a race. I think many of these problems could have been fixed by haveing it on a bigger system because the scale is so small a little bit of a wrong turn leads to a crash and it gets pretty annoying if you want an A rateing to un-lock more tracks. All in all i think its a fair game. I give it 4 stars because its just not bad enough for three with its redeming qualities.	1
This memory card I received was blue and white colored but it works just fine. I am happy that I can play my old games again! The thumbsized grip on it is actually quite useful for removing the card and allows for straightforward removal without having to "wiggle" it out which in the long run preserves the connection pins on the PS2.	1
works perfect, saved all my games and it worked just as i hoped, remember though!!! it doesnt work with PS1's. only PS2's	1
I purchased this memory card for my 5 year old son,let him open it when it arrived & he loved it. It had some data on it from a previous owner which is easily deleteable and not a big deal. My son & I are happy I decided to get this for him-it was a small reward for him behaving in Kindergarten :)It was very well packaged & was/is in great condition.	1
This game looks great, runs great, sounds great and best of all...it's tons of fun! My little sister and I are able to enjoy it together and she's 6 and I'm 22, it's fun for all ages and sizes! I highly reccomend this fun game, it's great for all ages and it's easy to control and to figure out. If you ever owned or played the old N64 version of this game and you liked that one then you will love this one....it's the same thing!	1
In my opinion, this is one of the best racing games known to man.  Yes, I do understand that it's at more of a cartoon point of view, but why would that make a difference?  The gameplay and control of this game are amazing, and leaves a ton of room to improve your racing skills.  I loved this game, and when I found out that you could race against your high scores through time trials, I became obsessed with the game.  There's nothing more challenging then racing against yourself. The multi-player is flawless as well.  I have yet to find 4 people to play against, but I've been looking to ever since I've bought the game. The only thing that might strike as "wrong" in this game is that all of the tracks are completly flat.  I've actualy grown to love that, because it forces the player to master basic skills of racing. If your looking for a fun and challenging racing game, I would put this game at the top of your list.  I've played each of the Mario Kart series (Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart Double Dash) and even though these others are also amazing, Mario Kart Super Curcuit is by far my favorite.	1
I have had Mario Kart Super Circuit for quite some time now, but just recently I wrote this review. This is a truly outstanding game that I'm sure everybody will enjoy. There are plenty of different game modes and characters to keep you satisfied for quite a while. You can select from one of five different cups to race in, plus one unlockable SNES version of the cup. You can also choose the difficulty level. From highest to lowest they are: 150cc, 100cc, and 50cc. Try to beat every track in every cup on every skill level. Now, for those of you who don't usually select the Racing Genre, I think this should be an exception. I'm more of an Action/Adventure type of guy, but I tested this game at Target and fell in love with it. It's a great game for people of all ages as well as for people that don't normally enjoy the racing genre...If you buy this, it's a game I'm sure you'll never forget.	1
When I first got this game, I also got 2 other games with it(The Fairly OddParents:Enter the Cleft and Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3) and I would have to say this is the best by a long shot. You get to pick from 8 characters from the Mario series and then race across 20 different tracks ranging from jungles to rainbows. Although the game isn't very hard, it is very fun. Gameplay:10/10. Really good. Graphics:7/10. One of the better Game Boy Advance games graphic-wise. Sound:6/10. It's acceptable. Control:10/10. One word: EASY! Overall:33/40. I think that's pretty much 4 1/2, but it's an awesome game so I give it a 5!	1
This is a great game to pass time on road trips (trust me, I've had that experience many times) and  for multiplayer. For the early stage of GBA game development, I must say this has very good graphics. The courses are colorful, detailed, and full of obsticles. The weapons are annoying when used against you (but then again, what weapon isn't in any racing game?) but not when used for your own gain. Overall, this is another one of the GBA must haves, in my oppinion, at least.	1
This is my favorite GBA game in the world.  It has awesome GBA graphics and it has addicting racing gameplay.  The powerups?  Oh they are sweat.  Getting the right ones and using them at the right time can effect the whole outcome on the gameplay.  And then the 20 tracks!  This is a good and rare thing on PS2 or even GameCube!  But to have it here.  And this isn't even including all of the bonus tracks.  It is really easy to beat the game on 50cc, but afterwards you'll have to on 100cc and 150cc which are really challenging!  This is a must buy!  So buy it!	1
Sometime ago I bought a nyko ps2 memory card for the ps2(which is just like the one pictured in the product details) at a garage sale used for $3 a couple of years ago. It works great and is just like the official ps2 memory cards. I have had little to no problems with the memory card. I opened up the case to see the guts and circuit board and the components are of high quality and craftsmanship. Upon further observation I compared the chip set of an official ps2 memory card(the ones distributed by sony) and the chip set of the nyko brand memory card and both cards have the same chip sets, both had a samsung chip and had another chip made or licensed by sony, the only difference is that the serial numbers on the chips themselves are slightly different which suggest that the chips are different revisions of the same chip model which could have been because they were made at different dates.   I own multiple other third party memory cards and had trouble installing third party software(not saving games, but installing third party software) on a third party ps2 memory card made by icon, but when I installed the software on the nyko brand memory card the software installed successfully with no problems. Basically you are getting a high quality memory card that are up to sony quality standards in a nyko branded plastic ps2 memory card case, this is as close to owning an official ps2 memory card as you are going to get next to buying an official ps2 memory card for a franction of the price. I definitely recommend getting the nyko brand ps2 memory card.	1
I was looking around my room and stumbled on my old PS2, I decided to play it again but I must of thrown out my old PS2 memory card cause could not find it anywhere. I saw this one and did not really want to spend that much on a memory card so got this one. It is great, had it for more than a month or two and it works great. Works like any other memory card but a fraction of the price, I enjoy playing my old favorits like Metal Gear and The Thing. I would recommend this to anyone wanting play there old PS2 favorites again.	1
I bought Mario Kart Super Circit expecting the quallity to fit sega genesis, but i was suprissed. This game is AWSOME and i would recomend it to anyone. Awsome graffics and game play. It is exacaly like the Nintendo 64 grafficly but different corses.	1
When I first played Mario Kart 64 I fell in love with it and played it day in and day out. When I heard a Mario Kart game was comming to GBA I had to have it. The graphics are great and the sound and music will blow you away. Best of all the fun dosen't stop after you beat it. You can win a new cup and a new racer, Waluigi. My favorite part of this game is the multiplayer racing, where you and up to three friends can duel in four battle levels or race in all the one player courses. this game is so awesome and I highly recomend it. Buy it for your GBA!	1
I currently own the snes and i have supermariokart. Its a great game but mariokart super circuit is ten times betta. Its more challenging and has new tracks and new items such as the triple green shell,the triple red shell, and the spiked shell. Plus all new drivers too. There are rankings that tell how good you are with the triple star ranking being the best. OOh yeah, for those who have the gamecube or are planning to get one, there's a mariokart game that will come out. for more information go to [website] and search for mariokart. OOh yeah, HOW DO GET WALUIGI AND THE SPACE CUP?...	1
this game is cool, but the N64 version is better.  better apperance, better handling and more battle modes, but i guess this will do while on the go.	1
This title stands as pure excellence. Tracks are great, and they are generally easy to navigate. The computer opponents always manage to stay competitive, and the replay value for this title is near unlimited. Graphically, it is very polished. The tracks are loaded with nice detail, and it really stands out as one of the best looking games around. The control has always been a strong point is MARIO games, and this is no exception. While there are a few flaws, they do not hurt the overall game too much. First off, the music is annoying. It really adds to the feeling that this is clearly a kids' game, alienating the older audience. All the racers handle very similar to each other, and you will be hard-pressed to find much of a difference. Certain tracks are also very easy to fall off of, and the battle mode borders on lame. But these flaws do not really hurt the game. They also cannot take away the fact that MARIO KART: SUPER CURCUIT is the best racer on a handheld.	1
If you like Mario Kart on Nintendo 64, you will like this game on GBA. The graphics are even better and you can take it with you. A couple new features to the game, but nothing spectacular. Can't beat the price!	1
I just recently purchased the Nyko PS2 Memory Card with a NEW colour scheme. Instead of the old yellow-and-black, this PS2 card is now white-and-blue. Of course it will work just as good as the standard Sony PS2 card but I just love the new version and how it looks. Hopefully [...] will have the new Nyko PS2 cards in white-and-blue for sale in the near future.	1
Ok so i've had this for well about 2 weeks and idk somethin happend and all my stuff i had saved became corrupted and even after i cleared it,it just never stops corrupting data. This is one of those things where you feel good to save money but then you find out that it wasn't worth the box it came in. I think it would be a good ideal to stay away from this and get the brand of the thing your gonna be puttin it in.	-1
this is the only PS2 memory card i have and it is great and it is cheaper than the sony brand. It last forever and has a lot of memory. Its cheaper and the same as the sony breand just cheaper and manufatured by Nyko. Buy it cause its cheap and works.	1
This is a great game.  There are a whole bunch of levels, and they are all completely different.  The graphics are some of the best that I have seen for the system.  All of the power ups and weapons make it even better.  This game is even better because it has 3 different speed levels.  The lowest speed is very easy and the highest speed is very hard.  So it is good for all skill levels.  There are also bonus tracks that you can unlock, and they are very fun. The only flaw in the game is turning.  You basically slide,a nd it is very hard to control when turning.  Overal this is a very good game and I recommend that you buy it.	1
I loved the original Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo, and Mario Kart 64 was one of the only Nintendo 64 games I thought was any good, so when I heard that a Mario Kart game was coming to the GBA, I snatched it right up.  First off I will say that it looks a lot like the 16-bit Super Mario Kart, but it plays like Mario Kart 64 with the real tight controls and track design.  The sound quality is excellent as well, some of the best I've heard in a GBA game.  All in all, Mario Kart: Super Circuit is an essential title to your GBA library.	1
Mario Kart Super Circuit is a great racing game, ported form the Nintendo 64 version. The first Mario Kart game for the SNES was hit, but the N64 version added new stunning 3D Graphics, but got got rid of some of the things that made the SNES game so much fun. Mario Kart Super Circuit takes the best of both titles to make one of the best kart-racing games around. It includes 20 new courses to race on. For those of you who have played both the SNES and N64 versions (like I have) you would find this game to be closer to the SNES title, which I personally think is better than the sequel on the N64. The graphics of this game are similar to the SNES game, but are mind-blowing for a handheld game. Like the SNES and N64 versions it includes 3 modes: GP (Grand Prix), Battle and Time trial. In GP you choose one of 8 characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong Jr. and Bowser, and race in a variety of courses in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc mode. 50cc mode is the easiest to race in, but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets a lot faster and more challenging. There are also several items that you getting by running over boxes which help you during the races. Lightning bolts (the rarest item to get) makes all of the other opponents small, mushrooms give you a speed burst, banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it, red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course, and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers. If you earn enough points to win a Cup you'll win trophies. Also if you race well enough and earn enough coins you can unlock new tracks from the SNES Mario Kart title. In Time Trial mode you race in any of the 30+ courses and try to set records for each lap and/or race. In battle mode you and a friend choose a character to battle against each other. You drive around a course trying to pop each other's 3 balloons. You pop their balloons by shooting green or red shells at them or throwing banana peels at them. This mode is very fun especially if you get tired of GP mode. The backgrounds are very colorful, and the individual go-karts are detailed nicely. The music and the sound effects are great as well, and the gameplay is amazing. If you are looking for a very fun racing game for your GBA, check out Mario Kart Super Circuit. It will provide hours and hours of fun for you.	1
This is by far the best GBA game out yet. Everything from the memorable chachters to the silky smooth control and graphics make this game an unforgetable gaming experience. This is gaming bliss. Buy this game now. You will not regret it. + Graphics Controling Multiplay Tracks Great weapons Memorable Mario chachters - Have to unlock tracks Final Score-9.5 out of 10	1
Mario and his friends all got driver's license to tear up the track!! Here are the Pros and Cons: Pros: 1 to 4 player action 8 exclusive characters Over 40 tracks playable Each person has different voices and cars Cool Course Designs Best items available Cons: a little to cute for some Have to unlock Tracks Overall- This game is a positive 5 star game with nearly any flaws to this game! Best racing Mario game in GBA!!!	1
One of the reasons I dug my old SNES out of storage was to play Mario Kart again. It was more fun than should be legal. Now there is "Super Circuit", a game very similar, but with a few differences, to the SNES classic. The track designs are upgraded, with more of a 3D feel to them. The Bowser's Castle areas look more like those out of Mario 64 than Mario Kart. The rich texturing and colorful animation take full advantage of the GBA's capacity (which is more powerful than the SNES, believe it or not). Too prevent the total deja-vu for older games, the track layouts are different, with more tracks, different objects to use both offensively and defensively, and a host of new challenges. This is a major plus because I beat the old Mario Kart in evey way possible. It is nice to have some new fun with an old concept. The music is superb, and the sound effects are classic Mario. As usual, you have a bunch of characters to choose from, including Mario, Luigi, Princess, Bowser, DK, Toad and others. A nice addition is that each character is rated according to speed and weight, so you can be more informed about which racer to choose. The controls are easy to master, and allow for fluid control while driving on the circuit. For gamers on the go, I cannot think of a more fun game. Overall, this is one of the benchmark games for the GBA, and one that ensures many hours of fun and quality game time. Anyone who has played the older Mario Kart will adore this, gamers new to it will love it just the same.	1
Mario Kart Super Circiut is a greta game. The graphics of it are a combo of Mario Kart 64 and Super Mario Kart. You can pick from many different Nintendo Racers in tons of different tracks. With the multi link you can play with multiple people. I reccomend using Donkey Kong. If you own a Game Boy Advance get this game.	1
Mario Kart has been a classic game on Nintendo. Since the SNES (Super Nintendo) was made, this game has been traveling from generation to generation. Finally, the Gameboy Advance version has arrived and its just perfect. You can select between 8 characters, Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, DK, Toad, Wario, and Yoshi and race more than 20 New tracks. It also includes the Link It Up, which allows you to play up to 4 players with only one gamepack. When I bought it, I started playing it and it was a blast! Then after a week or more, I beat it. It was worth my time! Then I continued playing and i got bored of the same thing. The only thing that kept me playing was battle mode. In this mode you have three ballons attached to your kart. You have to get power-ups and destroy your enemies until they have no more ballons and you have to protect your's. It is great while it lasts! You can also keep playing this game with your friends that have a gameboy advance (Note: You will need the link cable). Buy it and enjoy the world of racing!	1
This is a very excellent game.  I when I first played it, it was slightly difficult to control because it feels a little bit different than the N64 version, but I got used to it after a while.  It has incredible replay value, because not only does it have (i think) 20 all-new tracks, but it has all the tracks from the original Super Mario Kart. The graphics are amazing and the original tracks are almost perfectly recreated (there's a few minor things missing, such as pipes and other obsticles).  There is also more depth added to the game because of a rating system for each racing cup you play.  The highest rating is 3 stars, which is virtually impossible to achieve, assuring that you will play this game a very long time before you get a perfect score on everything.	1
I became hooked on this game from the old Super Nintento System, which I guess gives away my old age(33).  I was thrilled to learn that it was available on Gameboy Advance. The game has great grahics with beautiful color.  The boards are better than the old system, but more difficult too.  Of course without a challenge, we would probably soon be bored with it.  I think it is interesting how your completion of a cup (e.g. Flower Cup) is rated to show how well you completed it (e.g. E, D).  This adds an extra challenge to return to the cups you've already beaten to finish them even better. With a small portable system like Gameboy Advance I can carry it around everywhere. The only drawback for ME is that I loved the battle mode on the old system and of course with this one you have to have someone else with a GBA and a gamelink to play it. Overall, it's a great game to play and a great stress reliever.	1
Basically, in this game, you go and fight off evil creatures in your little pink costumes with your "laser" guns. Pros-Great for a fan of any age Cons-Boring - Any anti-power ranger's worst nightmare - Bad Graphics - Bad controls - bad gaming system.	-1
This game is awesome. I just can't believe that people can give it any less than 5 stars. Nintendo took one of the funnest games from their previous systems and provided us with maybe an even better version for the handheld!! The graphics are astounding. They will knock your socks off. The 3-D is incredible, and there is so much color in the game! But they use a nice blend so that the color and the motion on such a small screen doesn't make it hard to see. The gameplay is great. I mean, who would've expected 20 tracks on the GBA version?? And that's just to start with, you can even earn bonus tracks! In addition, these tracks aren't made short because it's a hand-held. They are anywhere from short to long tracks and the 32 bit processor handles them just fine if you ask me. All the original characters are there. The multi-player even features the famed battle mode! The sound is as good as can be expected on such a small device. The music is great, and not tedious to listen to, as I have found to be a problem with other games. In short, this was my first game for the GBA, and I can garauntee you it won't be my last! I suggest that you go out and buy this right now.	1
Happy New Year everyone!  I just received a Game Boy Advance as a Christmas present.  I had some doubts about the Mario Kart series going hand-held, but, as a big fan of the series, I still decided to make this game the first of my new Game Boy Advance collection. What a surprise!  This game is actually just as good as its predecessors!  With vibrant graphics, crisp sound, lots of tracks (so far I've discovered 24), tight play control, and all the characters from the past two Mario Kart games, the GBA Mario Kart is sure to keep the series alive and well! The best all-new features in this game would have to be the never-before-seen tracks.  They are remarkably imaginative and beautifully detailed (especially Sunset Wilds), and although they're not very long (the longest one takes about 2 minutes and 45 seconds to complete 3 laps), they're loaded with obstacles that range from the quicksand traps of the Yoshi Desert to the blind mice of Cheese Land.  Also, the play control is not only precise and varied among the weight classes, but you can even feel it getting more difficult among the more difficult tracks.  In Yoshi's Desert, for example, you can actually feel the quicksand trying to pull you in, so it gets even harder to maneuver around the already tight turns. But let's not forget about the things we already know and love about the Mario Kart series.  Some tracks are a blast from the past, too!  After all, no Mario Kart game would be complete without Rainbow Road!  Plus all your favorite characters are back, too: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Toad, Donkey Kong, Wario, and Bowser are once again racing for the finish line!  And the items are back, too--you can once again drop banana peels, shoot your opponent with a shell (green, red, or blue), blast ahead of the pack with a mushroom or a Super Star, become invisible with a Boo, and zap your opponents with a lightning bolt! So run, don't walk--or better yet, drive--to the nearest video game store and pick up this game!  I'll see you at the finish line! P.S. The "warning" that I mentioned is that this game owes a lot more to Super Mario Kart (for the SNES) than it does to Mario Kart 64.  The tracks are very 2-D, just like an official race track.  Therefore, fans of Mario Kart 64 might miss the hills and jumps of the Wario Stadium, or the mountains and valleys of Choco Mountain and Yoshi Valley.	1
( my son is going to do this review) hi my name is Andrew and I am 12 years old. this game is the coolest racing game to ever hit GBA. in the game you can be DK, bowser, mario, luigi, yoshi, toad, princess peach, and wario. as you fight and race your way to the finish line! as you race you will be able too pick up weapons like ( I am only naming a few of them)the red shell, green shell, spiked shell, lightning, star, and much more. once you have a weapon you can shoot it at your target! you have to be in 4th or under place to get to the next level but that is only if you are playing for a trophy. you can do a Quick run insted or a time trial if you want to pick any level. my favorite people to play as  are  yoshi, luigi, and toad and I use other people to play too. well all I can say is that this is a good game and that you should buy it. oh and it also one of my other friend's favorites too her name is Claire. remember this is a fun racing action game it is really fun!	1
For a portable game this is a very good game. Graphics and game play are both good and there are plenty of tracks to keep you entertained.	1
Ok, since I'm an adult my view on this game is likely very biased.  While the first ten minutes of gameplay was fun, I soon beat most of the tracks (with Peach) and it just became boring.  I can imagine this could be a good game for kids: driving and shooting and throwing bananas...  And there are 20 tracks to choose from (16 of which are available right away).  Unfortunately there appear to be a few bugs with the software that can frustrate the player.  In the end, I regretted paying (...) for a game that I won't touch again.	-1
When I first heard that there was going to be a handheld Mario Kart, I almost jumped out of my seat and yelled in joy. Mario Kart: Super Circuit has lived up to all those expectations and more. The character models were taken straight out of the N64 version, and at times, almost look better. The backgrounds look like a slightly modified version of the SNES game, but they still fit in perfectly with the game. Also, unlike the SNES game, sharp turns actually look sharp, with the body leaning and smoke coming from the tires. MKSC makes great use of the GBA's Mode 7 scrolling capabilities, which, for the less enlightened of us, means that the background is actually turning, not the character. Without this ability, the game would need to be fully 3D, which I'm not sure the GBA's processor can actually handle. In addition to the new levels, MKSC includes the 20 classic levels from the original, Super ario Kart. The cast of characters remains the same as in the N64 version, and are still just as good. The multiplayer mode is possibly the best part of the game. It has 4-player link-up capabilities, with the normal battle, Grand Prix, and Match Race. You can also trade your ghosts with friends, effectively training yourself fro your next race with him (or her, whatever the case may be). All this and more make Mario Kart: Super Circuit easily one of the top 3 GBA games (along with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, and I'm not sure what else), and possibly the best Mario Kart yet	1
Mario Kart: Super Circuit for GBA is a great character racing game.  Players can choose from 8 different characters and race on up to 40 different tracks.  20 of the tracks on this cartage are newly created for this game, and once you master those tracks the other 20 tracks from the original Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo become available.  What makes this game shine is that it has an infinite amount of replay value because of its ranking system and levels of difficulty.  Depending on how many coins players pick up and what their times are on each track, they get a grade for their effort.  The hardest grade to receive is a three star rating.  This is a really hard rating.  It will take a gamer a long time to get three stars for all 40 tracks on all three of the different difficulty levels.  While this game has a lot to offer, the lack of a feeling of true speed is what kept me from giving this game a five star rating.  It is an all around great game and one that should be in everyone's GBA library, but because of the lack of true speed, such as in F-Zero, and the mechanics of the power slide that were down graded from the N64 version, I am only able to give this game four stars.	1
Mario, Luigi, Wario, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Toad and Donkey Kong are back for another great racing game. The game is very easy to learn, big assortment of weapons (bananas, ghosts, shells, speed mushrooms, lightning bolts to shrink other racers) to get ahead and clobber other racers. The nicest feature to it, are the courses, because they did not try to recreate the same old courses in the SNES and N64 versions of the game. They took ideas and concepts from Super Mario 2 and made courses from them, such as Shy Guy Ship. The old favorite courses are still in it though, like Bowser's castle and the Haunted House. The backgrounds are intensely detailed, but if you take too long to look at the scenery you might spin out, crash or lose the race. You can compete in one of three difficulty settings, in four circuits which each with five tracks (there is a secret circuit too). The big age downfall is that there are tons of huge corners that drivers must learn different techniques to race around them. Not everyone can master these techniques.	1
But it is definatly a hit. When I first got this game, I thought that the controls were sucky. But now that I have played it for a while, I got used to it (It's hard to switch from the game for N64 and this one). The levels are totally awesome and the scenery is great. The tracks could have been a little more intresting though. I discovered that Peach, the racer, has the best speed AND handling. She is really good at sharp turns unlike Toad or Yoshi. The 50 and 100cc are quite easy but prepare for some real racing at 150cc. The graphics are perfect in this game, couldn't have been better. There are some extra tracks you can get in this game, I already have some but they are really hard. Great game with awesome play. Could have been a little cheaper.	1
Resident Evil Horror Classic! This Way Better Then Resident Evil 7!	1
Very Fun, and entertaining	1
the only damaged item in a combined order . cd cracked and taped	-1
Love the game. It works great, and it was cheap.	1
Great	1
This is a pretty good game.  I was really impressed with how many tracks there are.  After you think you beet it you find more tracks that you can play and race on. All of the graphics for these tracks are excellent with lush and beautiful backgrounds.  It is also very fun to make ghost data and try to be it again and again to get better.  After I played and played for awhile it did get a little boring.  Overall I liked this game quite a bit.	1
I am speechless this game is gotta be the best game for the gameboy advance except advance wars. The game has three different difficulties and in my opinion 50cc is to easy. Anyway the game has 50 levels and who would think they could squeeze 50 levels in this small game chip. The controls are very easy the turning depends on how much the character weighs. For example Bowser weighs alot and therefore it is hard to turn with him but on the other hand toad does not weigh alot so he is very easy to turn with. And then of course there are lots of characters to play with Wario,Donkey Kong,peach you name the character they probably have the character. And last but not least if you have a link cable and you have a friend playing with you you will be hooked. The Multiplayer options are great,the legendary battle mode and then of course you can always race with your friend on a wide variety of tracks. The ghoast trade is pretty cool but it is not that fun. The game has so many options it's got me hooked,and besides even if it did not have alot of options it would get a 4 star rating from me.	1
Well, I bought Krazy Racers first, then I got Mario Kart because everyone raved about it.  Personally, I like Krazy Racers better.  I won my cups in easy mode, and raced a few tracks in normal mode.  Overall, it wasn't too hard - except for the License Tests.  I have gotten all the cups but can't master 2 of the tests for the last license.  In Mario Kart, it didn't take me long to get the special cup in the 50cc category using either Peach or Toad.  I spent a lot more time playing Krazy Racers than I did Mario Kart.  Both have good graphics and good control.	1
zombie respawn to much and always covers the door.	-1
the game it self is great but the controls are HORRIBLE	-1
not sure if it was this one or the other one, order for my son, only had one disc was suppoed to have 2, he rented from the library and it had 2	-1
I've tried several times to play this game and I can hardly get through it at all. I'm a big fan of the RE series, I own almost every game they've ever made and I've played through most of them several times. This is obviously the exception. I'm not giving up on it yet, it's just so ridiculous. The graphics are beyond bad and the game itself is insanely difficult. I did find it terrifying, which is part of the point, so kudos on that one, Capcom.	-1
This is by far the stupidest game ever made. And its a shame because I love the resident evil series but this game is an embarassment you should rent before you buy it. Or save precious time and not play it at all	-1
Code Veronica is hands down the most frustrating, pain-in-the-butt Resident Evil game in the entire series.  The formula is the same, but the game is horribly imbalanced.  If you don't play through it in a very specific way, it is possible to reach a point where it literally becomes unplayable because you will run out of ammo.  That alone is bad enough, but there are other elements in the gameplay design that were simply not well thought-out, and cause the player a supreme amount of frustration.  For example, bats that will not leave you alone unless you have the lighter.  If you make a certain decision at a certain point in the game, Claire gives up the lighter, leaving you with no defense against the bats.  Then throw in the Bandersnatches, who have a completely unavoidable long range attack.  You end up standing there, trying to fire your weapon as they pound on you.  You're simply trading blows with them, and that's not good gameplay design.  The puzzles too are more convoluted than in previous games, so you often end up wasting precious resources like ammo and herbs as you run from area to area trying to figure out what to do next.  In Code Veronica, zombies regenerate after you've left an area, something which didn't happen in previous RE games.  So the more you run around, the more ammo you're wasting, and the more your chances of being able to continue in the game dwindle.  I've enjoyed all of the Resident Evil games except this one.  It's the stinker of the bunch.  Buyers beware!	-1
This game totally sucks majorly me and my dad were trying to play this game we got on the first level and then couldn't even get off the first level with reading the instruction manual too and cheats off of cheats codesguides .com worst game ever the first level your stuck in cell in complete darkness and keep walking around and then get no where.  Don't waste your money on this there are plenty of other PS1 and PS2 games that you can waste your money on.  Oh and you can play PS1 games on the PS2 for those of you who don't know that.	-1
Capcom doesn't seem to realize that people play video games for entertainment, not torture. The first boss battle is so hard I just took out the disk and threw it into the trash bin. This is not my idea of fun! Don't waste your money on this crap. All you do is run around looking for things to help you move on. You get pathetic weapons with very limited ammo, then you fight enemies that are very hard to kill (you unload almost your entire clip just to kill one lousy zombie). RE3 is alot better than this one - at least Jill knows how to dodge. If you still wanna try this game, don't pay more than 5 bucks!	-1
well, i loved RE2 and RE3 and i assumed this one would be just as good.  Boy was i wrong.  This is one of the worst games i have ever played.  The graphics are improved, but the plot is just absolute excrement and the characters bite.  the weapons are awful too and the controls seem much more difficult to manipulate. don't waste your time or your money	-1
Being new to the genre, I, for 5 years now, have been hearing that Resident evil is the most goriest and scariest game on the market. So I rented this one for PS2. This has to be the most overrated garbage I've ever played. The battles are so boring, I could crawl on my hands and knees and go faster than these zombies. The dogs? They're awful. To think that dogs are demons are stupid enough. This makes a fishing game look like Final Fantasy! And the voiceovers, ugh! Especially that boy. "You'd only slow me down! Huaa!" What a ... nerd. Don't play it.	-1
A good story line and beautiful computer generated sequences can go a long way to making a game a winner, but horrible controls and bad camera angles can also go a long way towards making it a loser.  Resident Evil Code: Veronica X balances out somewhere in the middle, and Capcom needs to cleanup the problems before it continues to go on to make another one in this series.  There's not much new from the previous games besides a storyline. On its good notes, the game does have a strong storyline with impressive cut scenes.  It does a superb job of creating a creepy environment for you to play in.  I usually play games late at night in the dark, but I honestly had to keep the lights on while playing this one to help tone down the spookiness of it.  Entering rooms and hearing the moan of zombies that can't be scene ate away at my sanity. Unfortunately, this is one of the few games I didn't play through to the end.  I rented it for a week, and have no intent to buy it or rent it again.  The action was very slow paced throughout the game, and needed to be because of the horrible controls.  Up walks forward and right and left turn.  That's fine if the camera is behind your character, but when the camera angle switches you need to do some quick mental gymnastics to figure out which way left or right is. Shooting zombies is fun, but there's no intelligent or tricky combat.  You'd have to rotate all the way around (there's a hotkey for it), push forward and pray there are no obstacles or camera angle switches.  The controls are just too hard to handle when attempting to do anything fast paced.  The static camera angles are very bad.  The moan of zombies lets you know they're in the room, but you often cannot see them because of the poorly positioned camera.  You either have to fire at off-screen enemies or wander closer hoping the camera will switch. Don't forget to respect the glass.  While guns can make zombies meet their end, they can't break windows or mirrors.  You have a limited number of bullets and should guard them carefully.  This is especially annoying with rooms where enemies will magically come back to unlife when you walk out and back in because you have to waste more bullets re-killing them. If you're a fan of the series or enjoy slower paced games with strong stories and good graphics this game is for you.  If you're an action junky, this game doesn't deliver and you should take a look at Onimusha or Devil May Cry.	-1
I enjoyed silent hill one a lot so I bought the second one about 10 minutes into playing the game there's a rape scene with pyramid head and two other monsters it bothered me so much I couldn't continue playing the game.	-1
I never saw a horror-survival game before, and the idea of a spooky game intrigued me.  So, I rented Silent Hill 2.  I figured I would be scared out of my mind, battling monsters that pop up out of nowhere, hearing strange spooky sounds, basically playing the game on the edge of my seat.  How wrong I was. First off, this is a sorry attempt at a game.  People say this is a puzzle game.  In it's loosest definition - yes it is.  The same way old games like King's Quest were puzzle games.  Basically, all you do is walk.  That's it.  You walk.  Really nothing else.  You walk and hope you find something.  Then you walk some more and hope that the thing you found works on something else.  That's it.  There's no complex or intriguing puzzle, it's just search around until you grab something. That was cool, in the 1980s, when game makers needed to make 50 hour games while only developing a few background scenes and characters.  This is the 2000s, and there is no excuse for it now. So, all you do is walk and fight or dodge an occasional monster.  That wouldn't be so bad - if they didn't make walking the most mind numbing experience in the world!  To move from one end of the street to the other takes forever.  The controls are sticky and clumsy, and the guy is really, really slow.  Since there's fog or darkness, you constantly have to check the map to see if heading in the next direction. How about the environment?  Not once was I scared or awed.  The graphics are below par for a Playstation 2 game.  The fog is cool for a second, but annoys you afterwards.  The monsters are a joke.  They're little bodies that couldn't frighten a 8 year old girl loaded with caffeine. Also, the "puzzles" are just plain ridiculous.  For example, here's what you have to do when you enter the town.  You're just in the town with no explicit instructions.  So you wander, then wander some more, then you finally find a key.  Big whoop, a key.  Then you wander some more to find where the key goes to.  So, after playing for an hour, you've opened a gate.  In Grand Theft Auto 3, you would have already killed a few people, and completed some fun missions.  In ICO, you would have explored a large castle, rescued a girl, and escaped dreadful spirits.  This game - you only opened a damn gate.  Once you're in the apartment building, you wander around rooms and hallways that look the same.  Finally, after another hour, what do you get?  A cool new weapon?  A great story cut-scene?  No - you get a flashlight.  What does the flash light do?  Reveal new secrets?  Find new terrifying monsters?  No - you can now read the map of the apartment building.  Two and a half of hours of game play, and I've done is enter an apartment building and looked at the map.  Bored already? What's worse is when you need to something to continue the story, but they won't tell you what.  This means you could be conceivably stuck at one point for hours because of you didn't do something subtle in a room that is far at the other side of the apartment building.  Remember, moving to one side of the apartment building to the other is a major chore in itself.  After being stuck for a few hours because I didn't go outside and look in the dumpster and pick up a coin, I knew this game had no hope.  I continued on until I reached another apartment building that looked exactly the same.  I promptly shut off my PS2 and returned the game to [the store]. Finally, in order to save, you actually have to actively search out the save game places.  This was the final straw. I kind of wanted to see the ending, but then I figured what it was.  Here's a spoiler for you.  The monsters that roam the town?  They're not trying to kill you.  Their the dead corpses of the players who were bored to death, warning you to return this game immediatately! You want a good puzzle game?  Get ICO instead.  This game just plain [smells].  It stretches a small environment into a major chore in order to squeze some playabilty out of you.	-1
Ok, it is eerie and creepy, but you spend literally 20 minutes walking without ever finding anything.  Yes there is eerie mist over everything and the soundtract is creepsville, but the game will put you to sleep before anything actually happens. The first minute of Bond Agent under fire contains more excitement than the first 1 hour of this game!  And your character can't stop moaning about how miserable he is since his wife dies--get over it-- I might actually feel something if the game contained any excitement. Rent it, and you will  spend the first 1 hour of gameplay walking around (not lost mind you) before you actually find a monster.  To walk from teh beginning to the town takes 20 minutes, and there is only ONE thing in between, and this is a cheesy cimematic scene.  Maybe I should give this 1 star....but, once it gets going, it has the usual Resident Evil stuff, gross and gory and spooky, but too drawn out and boring.  After each thing, you have to walk across the entire town for the next.  WHY??  Nothing happens!!  I wonder if this is just so the manufacturer can say that the game has hours of gameplay (they just don't tell you it is all walking in circles!!	-1
This review may go against the grain and many readers will hate me, but here goes....I REALLY wanted to love Silent Hill 2, as I thought the first game was fantastic, but when I got it and started playing it, it soon struck me that what I had was a high-res, polished-up retread of the first game, only less frightening. The game does indeed look gorgeous, and the characters and locations are superbly rendered, but it just isn't different enough. Instead of the spooky school, amusement park, motel and hospital, this time you get an apartment block, prison, hotel and, err, hospital...What again? Yes, blood stained beds, grimy basements, zombie nurses, its all a repeat of the first version, which seriously disappointed me. Whats more, the monsters are all real pushovers, and can easily be avoided, theres no threat like the leaping dogs or flying creatures from before. And the bosses may look the business, but they too are disappointingly easy, even the final one. Bottom line is, all the scary innovations from SH1 are merely repeated here, to less effect. The game is short and uninvolving, you can run around for hours without getting a scratch on you, as theres far too much ammo and health to pick up ( and I played on the normal setting), so you'll never feel in any danger. Another thing is that the heightened sense of realism means that some of the restrictions put upon what you can do are nonsensical. If James comes to street that is blocked off by just a lousy piece of police tape, he is unable to pass through!! Search a room in the hotel, but access to certain areas is denied because of strategically placed pieces of furniture, like a small chair that could be kicked aside by a child... What a shame that the series could not go any further than this, for although it will impress newcomers to the genre, it is nowhere near as impressive as the first game was when it hit the shelves those few years ago.	-1
this game is an old fashion side scrolling fighting game where the character is walking towards the left of the screen and several monsters are chargeing at you from the right. you are not allowed to proceed until you have beat all the monsters that are attacking you. but thats it. that is the extent of the game. you can fight one on one with someone else who has the game. also the characters stand and move much the same as they did in fighting games from the 80's. my copy ended in a used games store in less then 12 hours after i brought it. conisering the vast potention of GBA, this game is a waste of money. there are sever fighters like tekken that are out and much better)	-1
I am a long time Nintendo fan. Even now, when I have a Playstation 2, and no Gamecube, I still like Nintendo more. So this review is not just a bias complaint about Nintendo vs. Playstation. This version of THPS2 is terrible. Oh, yeah, it's tons of fun when you haven't played the Playstation version, but when you have, you realize just how pitifull this is. On PS, it's rated T, because they don't blurt out words like "hell" on songs. On Nintedno, It's rated E, so the whole family can enjoy censored versions of songs by Powerman 5000, Papa Roach & Rage Aganist the Machine. And another thing music wise: THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY THE WHOLE SONG! They cut out one of the choruses and the verses (this is an example), and just let it go from there. And the track doesn't go to the next track when it's done; it just plays over and over and over, to where you have to change it yourself every 3 listens. And it's not just the music. There's too much to say, so just play the PS version, PLEASE!	-1
I don't know what to rate this but i never really need this and i strongly believe nintendo made this only to make money and rip us off Cause: Zelda, Donkey Kong, Star Fox and more are big games that have a built in save system But any game that does need this is a joke Im sorry for anyone needing to buy this The expansion pak makes sense cause of the extra power. But most games again don't need this But the games that do? Nintendo was too lazy to make games that cant save without this yet can make huge tites with? Not sorry. Thats pathetic	-1
I've only played a few Gundam games in my life but this is definitely the worst.  I'll start with the positives.  The story is true to the anime and the missions almost mirror the battles perfectly.  The graphics are fairly decent for it's time and are good enough.  The features are pretty good and the difficulty level is tough but not impossible.    Now for the bad parts.  The game has a FAKE difficulty, by this I mean the controls are horrible and you will miss far more than you will hit anything unless your timing is perfect and you've mastered the "claw" controller grip.  Playing on a regular dualshock 2 is enough to cramp your wrist after an hour.  The AI is also horrendous and your allies will do next to nothing besides run in circles taking pot-shots at flying enemies and they might have an accuracy rating of 10% at best.    The sad thing is that yours will be no better than 30% unless you are very talented at video games and beyond that of your average online shooter player.    Imagine yourself in the middle of a war and your given a gun that is fingerprint locked with 4 safeties and has to prime itself for a few seconds after every single shot and takes 5+ shots to kill anything.  Then add enemies that fly in wide patterns and will rarely miss you, they also travel three times as fast as you to top it off.    Your basically a dyslexic turtle being attacked by bats.    I did manage to beat the game eventually but it certainly took more tries than I'd care to admit.  The first mission is the easiest thing ever but by the second you'll be yelling at the screen.	-1
Memory card only lasts a couple of months before a new one is needed again.	-1
Darn thing doesn't work.	-1
this thing stopped working after once use. It doesn't hold any memory at all. do not buy this waste of money.	-1
Popped it into my N64 and tried to use it.  Was immediately taken to a screen telling me that the memory card was broken and would not work.  Gunna try getting another memory card like this brand new hopefully that one works as I need a memory card in order to play Turok Rage wars	-1
I was not fortunate enough to have played the SNES game, but I thought this game was a major snore.  I really hate random dungeons. Actually, I'm not thrilled with dungeons at all, but these were longer and more tedious than any I had ever dealt with before.  The story was bland and the characters were not well defined.  It's also full of spelling and grammatical errors that should have been caught if they'd spent more time on it.  Altogether, this game struck me as a rushed job by people who don't really care about it. The save system stinks too. I hate only being able to save my game at certain times, I can't guarantee I'll have several uninterrupted hours to play and I like to be able to stop when I need to. Also, the story sequences take way too long.	-1
I have been a fan of the Lufia games since the first one was released on the SNES here in America.  When I heard the Game Boy Color was receiving an Estopolis game, I was immediately e-mailing Natsume.  "Will you guys be releasing it in America as Lufia 3?" It's finally here.  I plug it in.  All indications--pretty graphics, fun dialog, wonderful battle system, great play mechanics, good storyline, even great music, the best on the Game Boy Color--cause me to smile and giggle and thank the heavens.  I'm enthused to say the least. Then I figure it out.  Every dungeon is completely random.  But I keep playing.  And playing.  And I try so hard to like it.  SO hard.  The storyline is keeping me going, the combat is wonderful. Every dungeon may be random, but they are all EXACTLY the same.  Wander around hitting walls and things until you've explored the level the go to the next.  10 or so levels later, you have a boss fight and a story sequence. Repeat. Repeat. My heart is absolutely broken.  How can this happen?  The heart of the Estopolis games has always been the wonderful dungeons, now replaced by this absolute drudgery. Try before you buy, and make sure you have tissues to dry your tears.  I am praying that the Game Boy Advance Estopolis is released here, and that the dungeons, while they will still be random, will be more sensical and have non-random segments. This game had everything going for it, and one major flaw destroys it.  Why oh why?	-1
They said it was in Good condition, thats what i was hoping for until i put the card into my controller to save my game for 007 World is Not Enough and it said "Controller Pak may be damaged or broken" well it was! I am not happy at all about this product and will never buy from this person/company again!	-1
This product was not usable or even helpful. It glitched many of my Nintendo 64 games and caused my system to corrupt itself. It was nothing what the reviews I had read said it was. I am not pleased with this product nor will I re-purchase it.	-1
The graphics aren't bad, audio is. Driving isn't realistic. Mild fun. Gameplay is too slow. Did i mention boring.	-1
They are 6 different colors pictured, but you only get clear and blue, and they fit, what more can I say about them. You can store pennies in them, or use them to hold your toenail clippings, or you can...put your games in them. It really stinks that Nintendo makes us but these, they used to come with the older games.	-1
In this game, you can shoot webs, swing across the sky and fight evil through many levels. Sound like fun? think again. This game was one of the worst I've ever played. Each level is tightly scripted, and offers little exploration and freedom. The bosses, freak-specimens, criminals and other evil dwellers that you come across are so similar it's boreing. Though they look different, they fight the same. A punch here...A shot there, it gets dull fast. The levels are repetitive, and it becomes a real chore to play through the game. The graphics arn't the best and the sound sucks. Don't wast your money on this game.	-1
This game must have been a port from the original playstation, it definitely does not seem like a 2nd generation game.	-1
Not a very good game, even for the PS2. The voice acting is laughable and the graphics are pretty weak. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money. Spend your money on The Thing instead (PS2).	-1
I know someone is going to try and bite me for saying this, seeing as how every person I've ever talked to that has played the Metal Gear Solid games absolutely loved them, but I didn't. I've got the demo for MGS2, and played the first game, and if you are one of those rare people who didn't like the first game, this one is more of the same, sure the graphics are tremendously better, but the gameplay is no different.	-1
I am a big fan of Survival Horror games and recently Ive been going back and playing older titles I never got a chance to play.  To sum it up as simple as possible this game was TRASH. The controls were among the worst I've ever had to deal with.  The Weapons in this game are HORRIBLE. You basically get 1 Rifle the whole game and just keep getting little add ons which are confusing to use.  This game felt like a job really. Never at ANY point in this game did I feel like I was having fun or even partially enjoying myself.  All I know is this change in some ways changed my perspective on video games of the past.  Theres really no point in going back and beating old garbage video games. If a game was made more than a few years ago and you haven't played theres probaly a good reason why. IT SUCKS like this pathetic knockoff resident evil TRASH....  Storyline  2/10 Graphics  3/10  I honestly feel the RE graphics for PS1 are better. Weapons  1/10 Fun  0/10  Id rather slice my eyes open with razors  JUST HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE !!!!!!  Ok I feel slightly better now!!!	-1
There is one reason why I give this game 1 star. Because of one reason...the game is creepy. Why is it creepy? If you are a smart gamer like me, you know most Wario bosses are disturbing. The bosses in this game give me NIGHTMARES!!!!!!!	-1
I've been a fan of the survival-horror games since the first resident evil, and i'm a big fan of the series.  Extermination clearly doesn't cut it compaired to R.E. or silent hill 2.  I found the in-game menus annoying, and the enemies bothersome at best.  the graphics were fine, although nothing spectacular. I didn't play enough of it to say how well the plot develops, but it seemed pretty cliched to begin with.  If you're looking for a good survival-horror game for the ps2, go with R.E.: code veronica, or silent hill 2 if you really want to be scared.  If you've already tried those, you'll just have to wait for "the thing", which might prove to be the most innovative survival-horror game since the original R.E.	-1
I will start by saying this game shamelessly milks the R.E. and Dino Crisis fans financially, first, the script and dialogue is horrible, the graphics engine is even worse, to me this was graphics from a PS-One database, you would literally have to be drunk not to notice this, and finally, the concept of having to go back and forth and backtrack for things will eventually give you a migrane, anything from R.E. anthology wasn't this bad, I hate to slam this game but I have to be honest of my opinion of it, I'm just greatful I rented it first, and I feel sorry for those that have....	-1
Mutant Marines,virus spitting takpoles and Aliens interior decor all serve to tingle gamers spines in eztermination,but the real terror literally lies right under one's nose. Demon controls! These heinous torture tools will enrage Gahndi patient gamers. Try shooting down multi attacking bloodsuckers in third person with the behind the back camera view. Get used to getting mauled while being forced to stand still th shoot,and expect to kill mucho gaming sessions not infectoids with a completely ineffect oik auto aim. Still,the controls are atleast good for one thing:running something you will be doing a lot of to survive. TREADMILL SIMULATOR ANYONE?	-1
Man I thought this game would be a whole lot more exciting!  Through most of the game you fight stupid flukes-with-legs that you can pick off from across the room with no repercusions.  The enemy AI is simply not smart enough to be called an AI.  The controls remind me of Tomb Raider I.  While that was a great game back in the day, we've suppossedly made great leaps in game controls since then.  The story is kinda neato.  I just wish there was at least some kind of multiplayer thing to do or some other game modes or something.  Quite a disappointment.	-1
I just didn't enjoy the game.  I prefer games with more interactive gameplay than cinematics.  It seems like MGS is heavy on story time.	-1
are you kidding me? i bought this game and within less than a week i returned it! it was the worst game i have ever played! if you like wario get one of the old wario games like warioland 2 for the original gba or... you can just hate wario! sure at first you play it it seems good... i loved it at first but then it just gets lamer and lamer i mean who ever heard of getting stung by a bee and turning all swollen and flying... it is ridiculous! o and turning into a triangle block! i couldn't even lookat it in stores it was so horrible and not to mention the price... (depending on where you get it) for that piece of junk! im serious im not just writing this cus all my other reviews are usually 5s but this game is horrible kirby is a pretty bad game but not worse than this! i fell asleep while playing it wen i woke up my batteries were barely left! they should probably give you some free bateries with it!	-1
Metal Gear Solid appeared on the PlayStation back in 1998. Next-gen gameplay, a deep storyline and top-notch visuals and sound made it a breakthrough for the industry. Not only was it a revolutionary title for its time that pushed the console to its limits, but it was supposedly a good sign of things to come. That outcome would ultimately be its sequel, Sons of Liberty, one of the most anticipated of all games. The return of hero Solid Snake gave gamers another chance to experience espionage action once again, but given its reputation for its movie qualities over gameplay, when does a game stop being a game? Sons of Liberty answers this and much more.  Everyone was relieved to know Solid Snake made a comeback. With his newly formed team with Otacon, their mission objective was to discover the circumstances surrounding the new Metal Gear and make it known to the public. It started out great, drawing you in with the plot slowly unfolding and the continuation of Snake's story. Suddenly as a unexpected shock to everyone, gamers are soon placed in the perspective of a new character, Jack, a.k.a. Raiden. We are now playing as a whiny, snobbish and clueless rookie who gets in annoying conversations with his girlfriend, Rose. Why the developers chose to use the names 'Jack' and 'Rose' from the movie Titanic is beyond anyone's comprehension. Also, with film music composer Harry Gregson-Williams handling composition duties, it hints that Konami was more intent on creating a movie than making a game.  Raiden is without a doubt the star here yet Kojima did an excellent job of hiding it, not to mention tricking and deceiving the whole world into thinking Snake was the only playable character. Nowhere in the previews or even on the packaging was Raiden spoken of. The game has also somewhat lost the gritty military nature of its predecessors, becoming more of a sci-fi fantasy drama. The convoluted storyline that no one wants to figure out and the uninteresting cast of characters (which includes a bisexual vampire and a roller-blading fat guy) don't do the gameplay much justice, which has you mostly defusing explosives as well as babysitting little sisters in between boss battles. Since the entire incident was a Shadow Moses simulation, a majority of the gameplay structure and plot elements are simple rehashes from the first Metal Gear Solid.  The cutscenes and dialogue, which were more tolerable in the first MGS, are lengthy and often downright unbearable.  Many games, such as Nintendo's Ocarina of Time and Squaresoft's Vagrant Story, do a great job of balancing gameplay and cinemas. Sons of Liberty, however, does not seem to understand the difference between the two. The movies can be skipped over with ease, but doing so means missing out on vital information on the plot. If gamers want to know more of the story, they will have to sit through the movies, amounting to overly long periods of time. Watching the cinemas will make the game long and boring, while skipping them will make the game incredibly short. It's unrewarding either way you go.  Visually, Sons of Liberty is one of the better-looking PS2 titles, even today. The in-game and demo music, sound effects and voice-acting will be some of the best you will ever hear in a console game. The inclusion of the first-person viewpoint is also a welcome addition to the franchise. The story is definitely difficult to fully comprehend, but most players will give up trying to even care anyway. These stand-out aspects still cannot save Sons of Liberty from falling into the category of games that emphasize cinematics over gaming substance. The game tries hard to give its life message, in which we are treated to a well-deserved ending. But what someone has to endure to see that ending is just not worth it. Not even Solid Snake's Tanker Chapter helps heighten the replay value and fun factor. For those who do value gameplay as the dominant characteristic of games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty will simply pass as a title that is disappointing. With The Twin Snakes and Snake Eater joining the series, Sons of Liberty should be easily forgotten (or at least remembered for its unforgiving experience).	-1
I am not a fan of Metal Gear Solid, or its sequel for the PS2.  Often times great game creators are not great story writers, and that is clearly the case here.  The story in Metal Gear Solid 2 makes absolutely no sense, and becomes a chore to sift (and sit) through.  The game "features" hours of cut scenes and cinema that I would much rather do without.  If you skip cut scenes whenever possible, the game is relatively short and remains unexciting.  Metal Gear Solid features gameplay built on the assumption that trial and error is fun.  There are parts of the game where this gameplay mechanic is very successful, and sneaking around areas can be very enjoyable.  There are also sections of MGS2 that feel like they were included only to increase the total time it would take someone to finish the game.  Overall the gameplay approaches brilliance at times, but the negatives often outweigh the positives.  This game has one huge positive going for it: It is absolutely beautiful to look at.  I do not own an X-Box, but MGS2 features the best graphics I have ever seen, especially when it comes to in-game action.  The attention to detail in the visual presentation is an amazing achievement, and I applaud Mr.  Kojima and Konami for that.  Overall, MGS2 features brilliant graphics, occasionally fun gameplay, and an absolutely horrid story that makes no sense whatsoever.  My vote: 2	-1
Basically... This game sucks. The graphics suck, the dialog is boring, this title is overrated. I sold my copy to some idiot on eBay and I get a negative review because it sucks so bad. I rather play with a barbi than play this POS.	-1
Blah! I know I'll end up with a 0/955 helpful ranking, but I just have to comment. I'm sorry, but I don't understand why this game was/is such a hit. Sure, it has great graphics and music (which is why it gets the extra star), but other than that... The storyline is very complex. Apparently you have to get some metal gear pictures before the russians come or something. These cutscenes, as stated in previous reviews, take FOREVER. Half the time you don't even know what they're talking about, and you don't want to skip over it for fear you might miss something important. Then when it's finally time to actually PLAY the game, BAM! Horrid camera angle. Oh, and believe me, you don't get too far before you end up with another cutscene. And so goes the game. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't get into it. If I wanted a spy movie, I would've rented one. If you want REAL action, stick with Vice City.	-1
-Chad Steingraber- -Paradigm/Infogrames- -Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate- Sorry, but this game was not any fun at all.  I bought this game because of the previews and all the hype, thinking it was going to be incredible.  I played it once for about 30 minutes, was so completely bored out of my mind, I shut it off.  About two weeks later, I played it again...hoping that my last try was just because I wasn't in the mood for it.  This time I played again for about an hour.....  I traded it in for Jax and Daxter the next day.....at least I learned a good lesson from it -- don't buy it, unless I know I like it -- What a waste, the only reason it's getting 2 stars instead of 1 from me, is because of the graphics.  It looks awesome, it just plays like crap.  Apologies to the die-hard gamers out there, I just couldn't stand it.	-1
The graphics and everything in this game are great!!! BUT- the cutscenes ruin everything, it is so boring with them, and it takes several minutes to press the square button with the cutscene stopped.  i fell asleep during those boring cutscenes--- BOTTOM LINE___ the game would be great if the company made an option at the beggining of no cutscenes.  4 those of u who r fans of metal gear- i personnaly recommend not to buy this game! p.s. everyone who wrote a good review about this game knows how boring the game gets because of the cutscenes	-1
This is the worst game ever for a PS2. Why? Lets see: No 1st Person view, guns stink, fighting stinks, plot stinks, conversations stink, movies are too long, graphics paritally stink...to sum it up in two words: THIS GAME STINKS!	-1
It's obvious from the opening sequence that a lot of effort went into this game.  The graphics and music are top notch.  Unfortunately, the game focuses entirely on the eye and ear candy instead of gameplay and story.  It is, in essence, a horrible, horrible movie. The Metal Gear franchise has never been known for believible plots, but MSG2 takes this to a whole new level.  Like always, there's a huge governmental conspiracy, this time engineered by people that supposedly died 500 years ago.  Riiiggghhht. What's even more infuriating is the fact that MSG2 is really only a side-story.  Those of you looking forward to playing as Solid Snake again will be sorely disappointed.  Instead, his efemminate counterpart, Raiden, takes center stage.  He's the typical anime adrogenous hero, all pasty skin and long hair.  His story is not compelling in the least, and the setup to the climax is, in a word, stupid.  Anyone with half a brain will quickly see where he fits in the Metal Gear universe. To make matters worse, all of the "plot twists" in the game merely serve to create un-needed confusion, and seem incredibly out of place in the middle of a conflict.  Otacon's story just reeks of a soap opera cliche. The enemies in the game all have their own repetoire of abilities, and are all portrayed as two-dimensional, melodramatic [fools].  They look neat and flashy, but never seem dangerous.  Instead, they seem rather comical, which eradicates any sense of true drama.  I know I'm not afraid of some guy that Rollerblades while placing bombs everywhere. The voice acting is once again horrible.  Like in the previous game, emotion is handled via melodrama.  The voices range from growly to whiney, with no middle ground.  They neither endear me to the heroes, nor do they make me fear the villains. Finally, there is the gameplay.  The gameplay, like in the original, is great.  Unfortunately, the game hardly lets you play.  The plot moves through a series of cutscenes.  You find out where to go, go there, see a cutscene of the enemy, kill the enemy, then watch another cutscene.  Repeat until you finish the game. In a phrase, this game is not a game.  It's a horrible interactive movie.  Don't waste your money or your time.	-1
All right.  I know the game got a lot of hype because of it's great graphics, and it was the sequel to one of the greatest games of all time, but come on, this game flat out [stinks].  The gameplay is fun, When you're actually playing.  90% of the game is actually movie sequences.  I played it through once watching all of them and it took about 16 hours.  I played it through again and skipped them, and it took maybe about, 3-4 hours, if that tells you something.  Overall a very disappointing game, but it does have a pretty good story so it got two stars.	-1
Metal Gear Solid 2 is the most dissapointing, melodramatic, unexciting game I've bought in the last few years.  After seeing videos from E3 two years ago, I was anticipating this game like none other, and bought a Playstation 2 when it was released. There are some real problems with this game.  First of all, it tries to be something that it's not.  I shaked my head in disgust during the opening sequence, as the developer's names appeared like out of a movie, even pretentiously displaying the cliche of "any resemeblance to real life is entirely coincidental". Hideo Kojima, the "director" of Metal Gear Solid 2 is so high on himself, he goes so far as to refer to it as a "Hideo Kojima game".  After viewing this initial display of fake Hollywood gloss, I was presented with the actual game, which is tedious and ridiculous. I'm not the first one to complain about it, but for only two hours, you play as Snake.  The beginning of the game is intriguing, bringing back memories of the PS1 classic; the action and stealth are top notch, the suspense kept high with some riveting encounters and the fantastic new graphics.  Once you finish with Snake, the game becomes a train wreck.  The rest of the game you play as a different character, Raiden, who is a sniveling, petulant, cowardly "hero". The story is an absolute disaster, and since the game's focus is more on that than actual gameplay, the overall value is spoiled.  It involves tenuous diaglogue and double crosses, with endless cutscenes spliced between playing.  The actual gameplay is monotonous; it consists of Raiden running around "The Big Shell", peforming mundane tasks such as diffusing C4 and searching for THE PRESIDENT.  Originality in it's finest. The developers saw how successful they were with the original Metal Gear Solid and suddenly thought they were movie directors.  Initially, Metal Gear Solid 2 looked like it was going to be an action packed, exciting game.  Instead, it's a pretentious diversion, as it spirals downward after the first 2 hours, flooded with endless dialogue and boring action, wanting to be more like a movie that an interactive gaming experience.	-1
Cons: Too much and too often talking between charactors. Video segments too long Third person view ( especialy from the top is annoying)I prefer fist person veiw The Snake was great but Raiden was some kind of transsexual. In the portion of the game where he is stripped down and you have to actualy play the game with him running around nude with his hand covering his crotch. (...) Pros: Finaly quit playing before the game ended and went to rent a fun game.	-1
The only reason I gave this game 2 stars was for the incredilbe gameplay.  That is when you were actually playing rather than watching the cimimatics.  First of all there are WAY TOO MANY cut scenes.  They pop up constantly and run FOREVER.  I spent more time watching them than actually playing the game.  Secondly the story....  Where in the heck did they com up with this garbage?!?  A seven year old could have written a better story than that.  At least the other games had some sort of realism.  This one was way to far fetched.  There were some unique twists in the story which were good.  But overall...ridiculous and uninteresting.  And my biggest gripe is the fact that you don't even play as Snake for most of the damn game.  You only play him in the first part of the game which is on the boat. All in all, This is a game that should have been the best out there,... the benchmark for everything to come.  But in my eyes....grossly overated and worth more as a frisbee rather than a DVD.	-1
I gave it a one star because I was a MGS fan(the biggest ever beleive me) , and I am very disappointed about this game. I Mean i loved the first game i played it 100+ hourse beat it a number of times and liked it so much.  MGS2 you don't be snake.  And the end you wait for the big ending you say now i know whats gunna happen then BOOM it ends and the whole game is pointless.  If you never played MGS then you may like it but if you were hooked on the first, give it a rest.  I was dissapointed after waiting 2 years.  All the screans of snake you see in the first 2 minutes of the game btw.	-1
This game has more potential packed into it than any other game that has ever been made. But unfortunately falls short of a being a great game.  First off the graphics, the overall look of the game is really nice, but it stops there.  The characters are ugly with terrible motion captured animation, poorly designed Bosses and trite uninspired level design.  Where are the huge military bases where you sneak around and use all your skill to dodge guards?  Apparently not in this game.  Gameplay is basically the same as the first Solid title with some new and cool additions but on the other and a frustratingly impossible to aim with first-person mode.  Sound is pretty much dead on with a good score to boot.  Overall replay value, uh...err..there isn't any.  One time through and it's over, 12-15 hours long or rather 7-8, minus those cuts scenes.  Going back though to collect all the dog tags does not count for replay.  Where are the VR missions?  They sure as hell droned on about them in this monstrosity but they are not in this game and would really have upped the value of this game.  I had my hopes up for this one but I can only recommend you rent it or wait 2 weeks for people to figure out they did not really care for this game and pick it up used for [amount] less.	-1
What's the big deal with this game? It's not fun at all. It's way too fast. I mean, Sonic Adventure 2: Battle was fast, but not like this. In this game, you can't even see where you're going. And there's no explanation for anything. I was expecting a cool action/platformer with a few story segments. Instead, I was dropped straight into the first level with no explanation, and there was no break-up between levels, boss battles, and worlds. I was just so confused. It moved so fast that my eyes hurt, and I didn't understand it. It was a big fat waste of money.	-1
When I first saw this game, I was really looking forward to playing it, me being the old-school Sonic fan that I am. Anyway, I picked it up after reading several things on it. And I must say, I was really disappointed in what the game had. In my opinion, it shouldn't qualify as a Sonic game. The two player mode is really lacking something. The music doesn't even compare to the awesome compositions in Sonic 1 and 2. Yes, I know they included a few songs and stuff from the first game, but that's about it. The first thing I noticed was the character choices. If you play Sonic 2 or 3, you have a choice of playing as Sonic, Tails, or both. This game didn't have that, and that was a sorry thing to see. Amy Rose is one of my favorite characters, but I really think that the game wouldn't lack anything if she wasn't a character in the game. The levels and their titles weren't all that spectacular. Sure, they had a lot more boxes than the first games, and what really made me mad was the invincibility. I know they kept the same music, but the invincibility that's a Sonic trademark is the sparkles that surround the character. This game takes it from Sonic Adventure 2, and that made me upset, because it's just not...Sonic. The moves were hard to get used to, and (I'm sorry that I'm going too in-depth with this stuff, but....) all of the characters shouldn't have attacks, like in Sonic Adventure. Another thing that really disappointed me was that the levels were just too easy. There didn't seem to be enough badniks and there weren't enough turns and cool stuff like that. I think that people who aren't die-hard Sonic fans would like this game, and it's pretty simple. But I warn those who love Sonic like I do-this game is not like traditional Sonic. My reccomendation? Avoid this game, especially if you are a big Sonic fan. ~Amy Rose~	-1
will not work properly with my original Sims deluxe	-1
I thought the concept of a "downtown" area for my Sims and newly created Sims (that come with the downtown atmosphere) would be cool. They could mingle, hang-out, and make-out. Unless you have a guide book, expert help and advice online, and enormous capabilities for patience....you'll be very bored with this game. It is nearly impossible to get to "first base" with your Sims. I was so shocked at how hard just getting along was (as compared to the original version)!It literally can take DAYS just to find two Sims who will date each other, much-less kiss or get "funky". I have, however greatly enjoyed trashing the downtown area that comes with the game and rebuilding my own! Great fun in that department! The new downtown objects, people, building supplies, and options are outrageously creative and new...no budget to worry about...you just build to your heart's content. The game can be fun..as long as you are patient. Very patient. I am a bit annoyed with the game right now, but as all gamers know...someone will eventually post a "tips and help" site and then I can imagine this game being a little more fun. Until then it feels much like extra-credit homework in your favorite class...frustrating but fun. Hot Date has potential...I would love to hear from anyone who has mastered the lovin' skills...do email! Update: I have owned the game for a while now.  At first the game crashed a few annoying times, now I can barely play it.  The makers of this game KNOW there are problems with it.  i have spoken to them personally on the phone.  They have patches to try and fix it. BUT they don't work! I have now viewed dozens of websites with others (literally hundreds of people)frustrated and having the same problem.  I urge all people to wait before purchasing this game now. Check websites and wait to see if there is a functioning patch so you can play this game with ease. I hope this will help keep some of you from wasting your money!  I promise to update again when things change.	-1
I have been a big fan of the sims and when I heard of another expansion well excited doesn't cover it. So I max out a charge card and ordered it from one of greatest stores online,Amazon.com. In short the objects are outstanding but you have to tell your sims where to go and what to do the free will play is gone no more sitting back and watching. If your a control freak then this expansion is for you.	-1
The single player is great but the multiplayer is over run with CHEATER's, and westwood hasn't updated it but once and that wus a month after it came out so don't get your hopes up this wus a real disappointment for all you multiplayers out there who hate CHEATERS........................................................	-1
i was really disappointed with c&c's newest release. Although i am not one of those fanatical C&C fans, i do love first person shooters (fps). The AI is the most horrible i've ever seen in a fps, and i've played a lot of games. The characters look like boxes, Havoc's personality is a cardboard cutout, the script and story line is hilariously bad, and Havoc's lines are corny. Most of all, both the single player and multiplayer are desperately below par. The single player was much too short, the bosses are too easy to kill, and the scenery is atrocious. The multiplayer is just as bad, since the base defences are much too difficult to bypass and you can only carry one weapon at a time. Westwood truly disappointed me with this game, i thought they were capable of a more thought out and prepared game. If you are going to spend [$$$] on a game, spend in on Max Payne or Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Unless you're a diehard C&C fan, this one probably isn't for you.	-1
I wrote a review a while ago about this game saying how it was going to be bad because this game is definetely eye candy (if u could even call it that). I just played the multiplayer demo yesterday, and it was highly dissapointing... the game has so many bugs i cant describe them all... but here are a few: 1. VERY LAGGY 2. CAN't HAVE 5 GUNS AT A TIME. MAXIMUM OF 3 3. CAN't BIND SOME OF THE CONTROLLS TO THE KKEYS THAT U WANT (EXAMPLE: Can't bind strafe left to left arrow key) 4. When you reload, it will do the reloading animation twice or even more sometimes 5. After reloading, it will shoot uncontrollably The game is good for one reason. The creativity. No company would think about making a top view war strategy game and then make a sequel to it except it was a first person shooter in the eyes of a soldier in the game. So the only good thing about this game is the creativity. You can see why this game is bad now. Prepare to be dissapointed if you buy this game. Hope this helps, PEACE	-1
I can't believe that EA changed their great NHL 2001 into what is now NHL 2002. No matter how much people deny it, hockey is a defensive sport, and no, that doesn't mean full of checking. Electronic Arts is placing the emphasis on the completely wrong side of the game. They make the shooters much better than the goalies because they think that the people who buy the game want hockey games with scores like 15-13. That is not a hockey game, that's not even baseball. Checking is made out to be a form of physical punishment toward another player in the game. This is completely untrue and will most likely turn off many of the true hockey fans from this game. A check is any physical contact made in an attempt to knock an opponent off the puck, not to punish another player. It glorifies the big hits way too much and, by default, is set to replay a big hit DURING GAMEPLAY!!! Do you know how annoying that is? The only plus that I found was the level of the graphics. They are better than NHL 2001, but not by much. The graphics are the only thing that saved this from a 1-star rating from me.	-1
boring old game. tried to return the game and they said they would refund me for any unopened games. seems odd that they would say that especially since the game was used when I got it and released in 2003. not happy	-1
This is sadly one of the few games that I felt so bad about that I needed to write a review. My biggest complaint is that all shots by the enemy AI are predetermined whether they will hit you or not. This part of the game is beyond frustrating. Whenever you try to duck behind cover it doesn't matter because once that bullet is launched its gonna hit you one way or the other. All evasive maneuvers are pointless. On top of this, if you stumble upon an enemy and blow him away, he falls back and stumbles as bullets hit him. Magically he can still fire, his gun is pointed straight at the ground, but you can watch the bullet fly out and still hit you, even if his back is to you. The enemy also always knows where you are unless there on patrol. Patrollers you can sneak up on and kill, however, everyone else is always pointing there gun at you. Its rather frustrating walking around a corner to find a fortress with everyone's gun already pointed at you. The damage model is also horrendous. It always takes three shots to kill someone with a basic rifle and more with a pistol or submachine gun. The only headshot that actually kills someone is the sniper rifle. The enemies are also everywhere, you have to search every single corner of every single house, because there is always some random guy cowering in a corner just waiting for you to pass by. This is not unrealistic per say, it just that there are hundreds of them.  The rest of the game is decent. It has good music and a good attempt to recreate Normandy, some of the levels are pretty fun. But compared to Call of Duty, which is more squad based with better weapons and realism, this game is a weak shooter.	-1
I've read all the good reviews on this game and just can't bring myself to jump on board the bandwagon. I'm a pretty experienced gamer who just doesn't see any big deal about this FPS. The pros: Good graphics, decent sound, sometimes immersive gameplay. On some levels you ride vehicles for a change of pace. Lots of levels. The cons: Cliched missions, heavily scripted AI, constant saving/reloading during certain missions, average weapon selection, below average multiplayer experience. Difficulty curve increases dramatically after the first few missions. My biggest complaint with the single player game is some very obvious "cheap AI" and corresponding "cheap" graphics programming/level design. The game starts out very promising, with a gradual difficulty curve but eventually becomes an extremely tedious trial-and-error save&load game process in the later levels. The Omaha beach level might seem at first to be an exciting, panicked charge up the beach to storm the bunkers, but after a few tries you realize it's nothing more than a timing maze puzzle as you run from barrier to barrier to prevent yourself from getting hit by unstoppable machine gun fire. The sniper-city level is incredibly frustrating, as you must literally inch from spot to spot and pixel-hunt every angle and every shadow in the drab, grey backgrounds for equally grey enemy snipers, most of which are perfectly accurate and completely immobile, and sniping you from spots you cannot reach yourself. Though proponents of the game might argue this to be a realistic simulation of city warfare, the rest of the game is not paced this way, and realism isn't a factor anywhere else. It also might sound challenging at first, but in the end it's a continual load/save trial and error process that grows tiresome after the first 15 or 20 tries. You don't even get a muzzle flash to determine the direction the hits come from, and a handful of snipers seemingly hit you through walls or (after you find them and then retrace your steps) at angles you realize you could have never seen them. It's an artificial way to increase the length of this otherwise boring level. Later levels combine each frustrating part of the previous levels, and add extra "lame" touches, such as fog (disguised as a snowstorm) that you must slowly inch through to prevent being ambushed from machine gun nests and the scripted enemy positions. There's a vehicle-based level where you get to drive a big tank around, and it starts out promising. Sadly, it is also artificially made longer than it should be due to the fact that you have to shell every building you see - and it takes time for you to reload your gun after each shot. Regardless of any open-looking level design, there's only one path through each level, with things such as a low fence or small pile of rubble impeding your ability to sneak up behind enemies. The programmers should have spent more time improving the charge-then-squat AI routines instead of making each level artificially difficult by blending the soldiers into the background or adding dense fog to prevent you from strategically plotting your next move. Soliders may hit alarms if you wound them but don't notice when you blow away the guy 10 feet from them with your Thompson. There are a few missions where stealth is suggested but there's little need for it. If you're looking for a more action related WW2 based FPS, grab Return to Castle Wolfenstein. For a much better WW2 Multiplayer FPS, grab BF:1942. Grab this one when it shows up in the bargain bin at your local game store.	-1
This would be a five star review if only the program would run for more than 5 minutes. I'm running on a 1GHz P3, 256M RAM, ATI Rage 128. The demo runs fine but the full program doesn't like the video card because it keeps causing it to send an invalid signal and I have to reboot. I have the latest drivers. I don't have this problem with any other games. If you have the same video card as me, I don't recommend this game.	-1
5 of my friends and myself have bought this game...it only works for 1 of them!!!THis game constantly crashes for my friend that it works for! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!	-1
MOHAA is a game that is ideally suited for the person who gives no regard for even the slightest bit of realism and decent storyline. Essentially, this game is a slowed down Quake with Germans and Allies instead of Marines and monsters.... I knew this was not going to be a Ghost Recon, Operation: Flashpoint, or World War II Online, but its pathetic, and made me remember why I gave up console games so long ago. Not even a hint of realism here. MOHAA makes me think of the movie Kellys Heroes where the Americans march right through German lines and single handedly kill hundreds of soldiers, only this isn't even comparable to the movie because its so bad! OK, the game's graphics are really nice. Not on the scale of Ghost Recon, but still nice. Maybe if the soldiers weren't so dumb and you at least had a little control over them it would be slightly better, but you don't. I really cannot recommend this game to anyone except hard-core teenage Quake players. I bet it will sell a ton, because the gaming community has very low standards for success at the moment. Ill stick with Ghost Recon, Flashpoint, and WWIIOL for now. Hopefully you will check those out if you want good, fun, realistic games.	-1
The game is great if you can get it to work. The success rate for that is horrific. It does not seem to mater what your system is based on - AMD, Intel, VIA, etc. Your chances are about 50/50. Six other folks I work with have purchased this game. Only 2 got it to work right out of the box. Two others got it to work with a lot of sweat and tears and then to find it fail later in the game (audio looping problems). The remainder gave up and returned the game. I wish I would have done the same. Support for this game is slow in comming. EA hast left it to you to debug their software and find work arounds for the numerous problems. I advise two things:  1. log on to the MOHAA site and check out the user forums. It will give you a good idea of what you may face. 2. Don't purchase this game until EA comes out with a major patch to resolve the problem. Good luck.	-1
Caveat: I'm basing this review on the single player demo but what I'm going to say must be applicable to the full game because I'm addressing several design issues that are not specific to a single level (with one possible exception that I point out below). I've been joyfully anticipating the release of MOHAA on the PC for several months now. As is my standard practice, I decided to wait till I could try a demo before I bought the game. I'm glad I waited because having played the demo I now have no interest in the game itself. As someone who has greatly enjoyed realistic FPS (Delta Force, Rainbow Six and, most recently, Operation Flashpoint - a great game) I've been following the conversion of MOHAA to the PC with interest because of all the publicity about a "realistic WW2 FPS". Recently I've read reviews which have said that MOHAA is more a fun game than a realistic one. This is an understatement. There is no realism in MOHAA at all. It's Quake with swastikas and period weaponry. There are some good points: the soundtrack that plays just after you load the game is absolutely superb. The graphics are good. But after playing games like OFP and DF, I found myself stopping dead and staring in amazement as fellow GI's and enemy Wehrmacht "took a lickin' and kept on tickin'". The very first time I saw someone get hit 5 or 6 times (at least) in a row by an MG42 and just keep on fighting as if nothing happened, I knew this was not the game for me. Perhaps people who spend their nights playing Quake and/or Unreal don't have a problem with this but I definitely do. Tactics in this game are standard Quake/Unreal/Doom FPS and have no relation at all to real military ones. Taking out a Tiger with a Panzerschreck (sp?) involves popping out of cover, firing a round, popping back into cover while the tank futilely fires its cannon, then popping back out and hitting it again. Repeat as necessary. Unlike OFP, there's no control over your fellow soldiers so it's not possible to outflank or fire and maneuver. Enemy soldiers are a little too aware of their surroundings. Everyone (except you!) seems to know exactly where everyone else is and reacts accordingly. The demo mission is also very very linear but I can't say whether this applies to the missions in the full game as well. Oh well. I guess I'll have to wait till someone tries the "realistic WW2 FPS" genre again. This wasn't even close. That having been said: if you think Quake and Unreal are the best thing since sliced bread, I'm betting you'll love this game.	-1
First things first. You learn spells how? Tracing the symbol with your mouse. Big Whup. it is just a cheap immitation of a leading series. half of the game, all you have to do is click, move, click, move, click, etc. the recreation of the story is so-so (which is responsible for the 1 *). i will list the pros and cons later, but first a graphics check. The {so-called} advanced graphics didn't run with my computer, so Harry's eyes were on top of his head, beside the mouth. I not so sure it was my computer, either, because I have a NVidia Geforce 3, 64 bit video card. I would buy Jedi outcast instead. one more thing, Snape isn't that mean. and, furthermore, Harry can jump 10 feet. come on! and now, the moment you have been waiting for, the Pro-con list! Pros 1.good Quidditch recreation 2.relatively good storyline Cons 1.graphics couldn't be worse 2.jumping is unreal 3.spells are too easily cast 4.(the cruncher) IT IS NOT EXITING OR LONG ENOUGH	-1
this game is SOOOOO fun.. but SOOO easy and short.. i beat this game in 2 days... don't get me wrong... this game is fun. but it gives only 4 hours of gameplay (no strategy guides) the game gta3, gives about 100 hours of gameplay. thats the difference. Every level is wicked easy accept for the one where u sneak down from the tower, and the last level where u fight that ugly person. again, i say u should rent this game, (for ps or ps2), blockbuster gives u a week of rental with ur.... GAMEs FREEDOM PASS!!...rent this game for a week, and beat it in a day.	-1
I think this game is pretty bad. There are too many problems that I am going to list here: *Not enough save points *Hard to move your wand around to cast the spell at the enemies *Everything is an adventure they never let u relax *In quidditch it is kinda hard to catch the stupid snitch *sometimes the game will go really slow with older systems Also you can't explore and this game isn't that good anyway.	-1
Loved the books...hate this game.  Admittedly, I may not have given this game a chance.  The graphics are poor and movement is archaic.  What's up with using the arrow keys?  What ever happened to games which allow you to use a joy-pad or mouse (more effectively).  In their haste to release a video game to accompany the movie craze, EA has classified their loyal customers as well as the general public as idiots willing to spend money on any kind of "Harry Potter" junk. From what I can tell, this game isn't even worthy of release as freeware.  Perhaps the game improves later.  I wouldn't know because the flashing blue, red, green & yellow lights all over the Hogwart's castle walls gave me a headache.  I wasted my money on this game and made the conscious decision not to waste any more of my time trying to play it.	-1
I bought this game expecting something similar in quality to Novalogic's "Delta Force LandWarrior" game. What I got was a system-devouring, buggy crash-fest.   The game installed without incident, and I played the first mission without too much consternation (why does the mission suddenly stop when most of the bad guys are down? No mopping up allowed? I took off from the base, can't I find my way back and land?) but the next mission had too many tanks or planes I guess.   At first, the game turned into "Commanche 4: The Slide Show", then it crashed--Ka-Boom! I realized that when I came over a particular hill during this mission at a particular angle of attack, the game would have a stroke and start locking up. If I ran into another chopper (one appears in the distance), the game would brain-freeze. I have been playing alot of graphically intense programs lately with no problems, I have a Geoforce2 card, 512MB of RAM and a P4 machine; so what is the problem?? Who knows. The graphics in this game aren't that hot, the gameplay would be almost worth it, if Commnche 4 worked properly. I WANT MY MONEY BACK! Buy the "Commanche Vs. Hokum" game instead, it is MUCH better: a realistic flight model, better controls and it doesn't gobble up your computer or stop the sim when it thinks you're finished playing.	-1
NOT worth the money!  Not a Sim. not even a good arcade Game.  What a shame,  good to great in special effects (Bombs,etc.)but to high in  hardware needed for this type of game.  Even the old Apache is way better in game play.  Wait a year or so and get it for a song, even an out of tune one. Don't buy it at full or even half price!!!!	-1
City Crisis is a helicopter simulation where you put out fires and rescue people from buildings.  You can also use the helicopter to illuminate fleeing criminals with the night sun.  Unfortunately, the game has horrible graphics and even worse game play, and the missions are redundant.  I'm just glad I rented it and didn't waste more money buying it.	-1
Well you gotta give the game some credit, for its orginality at least.  I've never seen a game like this before with a sim city view as you rescue innocent victims or chase down criminals.  Now for the negatives.  The game has terrible sound.  The same music plays repeatedly over and over again throughout every single mission and that "accident" voice gets really annoying (u'd know if you played the game).  Next, on to graphics.  YUCK!  C'mon, the city looks like a mess of jagged lines.  What a terrible sim.  Then, the controls: HARD!!!  Don't think you'll ever get passed the first mission.  Overall, a good rental but nothing more!	-1
This game [stinks].  Don't buy it.  The graphics are par for a 64 bit system, not PS2.  The play control is beyond terrible.  There is no variation on the weather... it is always sunny and clear, and the missions are long-winded and stupid.  The music is annoying as well.  Don't waste the [money] even to rent it.	-1
If you are used to SSX and Smuggler's Run type of graphics thisis not you game. The stly of gameplay seems slow and not very interesting, it also is a unpleasent reminder of September 11th, putting out fires in burning buildings will not get my liking or intrest for a few years.	-1
This game is extremely annoying for two reasons. First, it gets extremely laggy sometimes for no apparent reason. Also, the AI is not fun to play against. The AI is extremely fast because it doesn't have to use the mouse. However, the AI is also really stupid, and it doesn't have a good strategy, even on the hardest difficulty. So, playing against the computer is not fun.	-1
Ok, I admit Flight Simulator is a great program.  I have bought Flight Sim 98, 2000 Pro, and now 2002 Pro.  Each program is better than the last, but only slightly.  I find the ATC feature sort of cheezy.  I expect they will fix this in a hurry though by the next version.   The Frame Rate has increased with the new version, which is a delightful surprise.  The scenery appears pretty much the same with the exception of randomly appearing and disappearing buildings.   The packaging is ....  All I got was a box, pamphlet, program, and CD envelope (not even a jewel case).  The Quality is no longer there as with previous Microsoft products.  If you have (or ever) purchased Microsoft Train Simulator, you'll know what I mean.   If you do not own a Microsoft Flight Simulator, I recommend buying it.  I don't however, believe [it is] is worth it simply as an "upgrade".  Stick with Flight Sim 98 or 2000 until they develope an upgrade worth paying for.	-1
The demo for this game {if one could call it that) was on the Sims Hot Date, or some expansion for the Sims.  It seemed pretty fun, and since they restricted you to 3 courses, I really wanted to know what it was like to build a big golf resort.  And so, I got caught in the trap.  I went out and bought Sim Golf...  The worst waste of money in my life.  I quickly became bored with the different buildings (there are so few!), and although the course building tool was kind of interesting, it was far from addicting...The actual golfing aspect of the game required no skill, and the houses you build for celebrities are a plain waste of time...It is a plain waste of time, money, and of course, megabytes.  I can't wait 'till the Sims Superstar comes out...Don't make the same mistake I did, and get a better game.  This is just a plain disgrace.	-1
Seemed excited when she opened the box, but as far as I can tell, my daughter has not played this game much. Asked why, she said it was alright.	-1
Flight Simulator 2002 is a good game but when you fly the planes you do nothing. You just end up crashing because theres  nothing to do in the game. One plane won't even get off the ground. I don't know why they put that plane in the game.	-1
So, this game, or more specifically its PC predecessor, is a masterpiece in the history of the genre.  At least, that's what people say.  I'll never know.  The controls on this version of Deus Ex were so complex and awkward that I found them frustrating, and, consequently, the game was a miserable experience.  I'm not much of a FPS player, but there is a huge difference between intuitive controls (e.g., Halo), which are possible in ANY game, regardless of the overall complexity of the in game actions and the completely awkward, counter-intuitive, and ultimately frustrating control scheme that defines the gameplay in the PS2 version of Deus Ex.  Are the controls an unavoidable result of its conversion from PC to console?  Probably not - plenty of other games have been ported and have still been wonderfully playable.  Oh well; it's a shame I'm missing what sounds like a really interesting game, but I have better things to do than spend hours training on and acclimating myself to a poorly designed control scheme.	-1
I was curious about this game. My brother loved the pc version and loads of people have been raving about in the reviews so I bought it for the PS2 eagerly opened it and started playing. I have to admit I didn't even get past the first level. The movement is horrible, I was expecting something as well done as Red Factions movement. The frame rate drops constantly. To put it another way, it felt like I was playing a first person shooter that predates Doom (for any of you who don't know, Doom was one of the first first person shooter games ever)or it seems like a first person shooter done on the original playstation. It seems like this port was half done and was relying on the popularity of the PC game to sell it. So as not to be totally negative I did think it was a cool story and that you could make decisions in the game that affected how the game progresses, but unfortunatly a game cannot be considered good just b/c the story is good. If you are still considering buying this half finished game, I'd suggest you rent it first or buy it for the PC (there are even adapters so you can use your PS2 controller with a PC now). If this were the first PS2 game I ever played I would have gotten a gamecube of xbox.	-1
I was looking very forward to Arctic Thunder for the PS2 as I love the Arcade game.  Unfortunately, Midway did a rush job on this game, and it is rather disappointing. The graphics are choppy, making it hard to figure out what is going on sometimes.  It is also hard to figure out which weapon you have, and which enemy you are firing it at. Unfortunately, it appears that Midway did not take their time with this game.  It could have been a big hit, instead this one will soon find its way in used game bins everywhere. Save your money for a better game!!	-1
When I was 13, I played this game and loved it. I tried it again at 25 and it did NOT age well. The storyline is so poor that it annoyed, the voice-acting and dialogue is so inauthentic that it is painful, and while Dante is still cool after all this time he is literally the only character I like.  This game isn't so much write FOR teenagers as it sounds like it was written BY teenagers.	-1
I've always enjoyed Capcom's method of making difficult games. If you die in a Capcom game, it's generally not the fault of the game, but the fault of the gamer. Their games, such as Onimusha and Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, require you to get improve your skills in order to succeed. Unfortunately, that's not the case in Devil May Cry. A majority of the time, the game is at fault for your death. Poor camera angles are at fault most of the time. You'll find yourself fighting a lot of enemies who are not onscreen, and many times they get a free hit or two on you because you don't see them coming. Yes, enemies do make a noise to signal an attack, but that's hardly helpful when you're concentrating on those enemies that you can see. This is worse when fighting some of the bosses, such as Griffon and Nightmare. There will be times when you are blasting away at them while they are off screen. Shooting at the edges of the screen is not as fun as shooting actual enemies that you can see.  There is a point of frustration in which a game can get away with, but once in a while a game will break that barrier. The point of video games is to have fun, not to stress you out. Devil May Cry is more stressful than it is fun. Though most levels are only ten minutes long, you will die so often they take much longer than that to complete. And along with poor camera angles, another reason you will likely die so often is the speed the game plays at. Things happen so quickly in Dante's world that it would seem Capcom made this game for people with short attention spans. To focus on one enemy for more than a second means you will likely lose your health to another attacker, but to take your eye off the one enemy means you might miss a surprise dodge and attack. I wish Capcom at least allowed blocking, as it would be far more convenient than trying to jump every enemy attack. However, that would slow the game down. This is a pure action game. Strategy is not required, or welcome. This is a game meant for somebody young, with quick reflexes, and an attention span trained on Saturday morning action cartoons. If you do not have those qualities, I would not recommend this game.  Not everything is bad in Devil May Cry. For one, the graphics are very nice. The character animation is so brilliant, I was almost convinced that I was fighting real demons. It's a game that screenshots do not justify. You have to see it in motion to realize just how good it looks. Also, the controls are very well done. Capcom expertly creates a control layout that allows you to fluidly shift from firing a stream of bullets to leaping in the air and slashing an enemy with a sword. I just wish the game was more fun and less frustrating because it has so many excellent ideas. I am willing to admit that the game probably just wasn't made for me. I'm more casual gamer than hardcore, and this is the type of game hardcore gamers relish. It provides a very difficult challenge and requires lots of time and practice be put into it. As a gamer who finds that age has slowly taken a hit on his response times, I find it difficult to recommend the game to people who aren't highly skilled in gaming, or whose skills have dulled. If you want to enjoy a game, there are plenty better games to choose from.	-1
Summary:  This game is horribly unbalanced against the player.  And this makes playing it absolutely frustrating.  With poor story progression, there isn't much to make one want to put oneself through such a horrible experience.  BUT, it just might be worth your while if you like the visuals and gameplay style.  I'll admit I really enjoyed these aspects.  If only they were accented by the rest of the game...  Reasons I like this game:  1. Good graphics.  2. Enjoyed the Resident Evil meets Shinobi style.  Reasons I hate this game:  1. Camera:  Generally fixed camera.  Always centered on player.  This is great.... except when you're in a corner, which you usually are.  Then the camera is facing the corner and not outwards, where you'll obviously be facing to attack oncoming enemies.  This camera may work for games like Resident Evil where you have plentiful healing items and where the enemies don't move freakishly fast, but both of these are major issues in this game.  I'll elaborate in reason 3.  2. Difficulty:  I'm not your average gamer - I'm always adept at any game I play.  And I've spent probably as much time I've been progressing in this game retrying levels (7 hours-ish).  This is due in part because of the horrible retry system, which takes you all the way back to the beginning of the stage if you lose.  If you have a yellow orb, you can retry from the last door, BUT you lose all your equipment you used on your last try... why even call it a "retry" then?  If you failed with the equipment, you'll fail without it.  Other than this, the enemies movements are just too erratic and fast.  No matter how much I get these enemies' strategies down, their attacks are still insanely difficult to dodge.  And the enemy strength doesn't help - a regular enemy can take off half of your health bar with a single attack.  Major problems for this: you are only allowed ONE potion item.  And health drops are VERY sparse and VERY weak.  This makes bosses particularly difficult.  3. Upgrades:  This game has a very nice upgrading system that allows the player to pick and choose what is desired.  The problem is that most of the upgrades to weapons aren't very useful, yet they're outrageously costly.  It will take you days if you want to grind the cost to gain all of the upgrades/items you want.  And enemies are sparse for grinding.  4. Controls:  There is a button to switch melee weapons, but no button to switch guns.  Even worse, when you do switch melee weapons, an animation will be performed making you vulnerable to attacks.  So you're forced to do it the old-fashioned way by opening the start menu and taking half a minute re-equipping your desired gear.  This makes battles very slow where you need to switch weapons because of enemy elemental properties.  Not to mention it just becomes tiresome after the 30th time.  5. Story:  Started strong, ended horrible.  It's like the whole Inuyasha series smashed into 7 hours.  Imagine all the filler...  Well, the story is interesting at the beginning, though not much is explained.  But after that, it seems like they just pieced together backstories to all the stages.  Example, there's a tiny story (of about 3 lines of text long) about some item you need to get.  Game done.  But seriously... these kind of stories are what you're treated to most in this game.  Very sparsely is the gameplay ever tied to the main character's story.  6. Music:  Repetative and generic.  Same battle music is repeated over and over throughout the entire game.  This music is VERY basic and VERY stereotypical action rock music.  7. Platforming:  This game is by far the worst platformer I've ever played.  Half of the time you can't see where you're jumping because of the camera as stated before.  The other half when you can see is still riddled with problems.  You can't always grip onto platforms or the character just fails to, which is immediately annoying.  But even worse it is so difficult to land exactly on top of some platforms.  Platforming is not intuitive in this game AT ALL.  Some jumps are performed automatically when you jump from certain ledges that require a longer jump, and some jumps you have complete control over.  Which jump is the one you'll be doing?  Who knows!!  There is no way of telling.  Most jumps have some sort of automatic contol, where you are in partial control and are partly guided.  This is so necessary, because of the lame platforming in this game, BUT this is also very problematic.  Since you are only in partial control, your character makes unordinary jumps.  This is very tricky for two reasons: (1) the partial automatic control sucks, you will miss your jump often, and (2) its hard to determine which jumps you can make because you don't know exactly how the jump will react.  8. Fanbase:  I bought this game because of the heavy embrace by a very large audience.  This leaves one to wonder.... why?  It leaves me to worry about my human kin, and their interest in this outright annoying game.	-1
this game starts out ok, then later becomes plain stupid. no plot at all, you don't know why you need to do this, why you have to go there, where should you go next. sure the action is fun until you face the annoying cat-like shadow creatures. i was literally wishing death to whoever designed these enemy while i was battling them. there are also secret missions which are nearly impossible to do. did they even test this game before they released it? don't buy this crap, get onimusha 2 or 3 instead.	-1
I do not understand all the praise for this game. Not only is their little to no plot (except for the one they throw in at the end to give you some kind of closure), but this so-called action packed action thriller slows down the action with these missions that have you scratching your head. "Why do I need this orb?" "How come I have to open this stupid door?" "Why the heck am I doing any of this at all?" I asked myself constantly why each mission was so important when the game was giving me absolutely no reason for any of it. I tried to enjoy the action but was caught up looking for items or trying to open doors to reach the next level. Some missions are so short, literally all you might do is run and open a door and a mission is over. The action would feel more intense if you were forced into most of your fights but if you wished you could simply run away from at least half the battles. The bosses were pretty cool but the motivation really wasn't  there. Who were these people to you? Why do they want you to die? If they wish to make this a real action game, forget the 'resident evil' style puzzles and just do a 'final fight' type style where you just have to  fight your way to the end of a level. I just really wasn't all that impressed. It was really short and since their was no plot I felt nothing for the main character or the villian for that matter. It was over before it began. It was like a summer blockbuster movie, with no plot, not as much action as promised, and too  many special effects. A very underwhelming experience of a game. I'm glad it was cheap.	-1
I think the game frame is good, but the story and the cinematics were fair. When you have a machine with the power of the ps2 you ca develop better stories. I ended the game quickly not like his counterpart Resident Evil: Code Veronica X.	-1
i seriously and in all honesty cannot comprehend why there is such a huge fanbase for this game.  this has got to be one of the most bland, non-immersive games i have come close to in a long time.  i made the mistake of buying this thing after i heard such great reviews for it, with all these great moves Dante has and blah blah blah, and that it was developed by the same people as Resident Evil (my favorite game series ever), so well, i got sucked in, and for the first few minutes i was interested... it seemed cool to kick some serious ass thanks to Dante's vast arsenal of moves.  but after like 15 minutes, it got to the point where the game was going nowhere... there is NO puzzle-solving (and if the developers consider this game to have puzzles, then i could just as well hide a rock under my bed and leave notes saying where the stupid thing is and call it a puzzle) and the moves are so simple, there is NOTHING you have to do except press one, or two button combos. i mean, yeah, the moves are pretty neat to look at for the first few minutes, but all this info throughout the game about strategizing being a MUST so you can target specific enemy weaknesses is just a load of crap.  Hit the action button 3 times, regardless of whom you're fighting, Dante slashes his sword in a funky way 3 times and that's it. monster dies, you move on. you could honestly have a deep conversation with someone else in the room and not lose in the game as long as you keep pressing the button blindly.  it's that stupid. i'm sorry but i thought this was going to be something else that just a plain shoot-em'-up, sword slashing game.  and it pitifully epitomizes the above characterization perfectly. point is, i'm done with this game.	-1
How to ruin a game & make it impossible? Crash dies in one hit You loose all progress You miss anything. You gotta go back Getting 100% is a pain Not like getting all the hearts in zelda. Oh no Doing stages multi able times Finding extra gems to get extra levels Finding crystals Lame powers But what really kills the game are bosses First boss. Evil crash with the rock element You must get all the rocks & attack him before he gets all the rocks turned red. Simple but be careful I might be forgetting but the water boss Oh god the water levels & boss A true nightmare The boss is a water element crash. You must dodge hes high & low attacks as you jump from platform to the next. This guy was a big jerk. The kind of boss that will make you rage Next is the storm boss. Evil crash is a tornado Your in a plane. You must watch out for hes lighting walls. Thanks cousin for beating those two jerks but also hogging the game Next is fire. You got a fire fighter mech & after each attack you got to walk a greater distance again & again after each attack. Very hard but some what playable? Worst/hardest game in history	-1
Did not like this.	-1
I hate this game this is a hard game I played up to level 10 I cannot get the crystal from H2 OH NO I die a lot my brother cannot even get through it it is not fair that I get a game like this but I do like the graphics though. I give this an above average 0 stars out of 5.	-1
it sux. never get it. u just hop around getting smashed by things. i played it once and hated it. im srry for the ppl who have it!!!	-1
... when they realize they shelled out ($) for a game they finish in about 7 or 8 hours. Good graphics (not AWESOME... just good), but the controls can be tricky. You can complete it in the span of a 5-night rental at Blockbuster.	-1
I'm surprised this got an Editor's Choice, I'll be a bit more wary of that label now. If you're looking for anything like the original frogger, this is *not* it. I'm about 4/5 done, and the only reason I continue to play is to finish and shelf the cartridge. The game play is repetitive and dull. After playing the first level, you've pretty much seen all it has to offer.	-1
I am sorry, but!!! i have to say what everybody is saying this darn game is just bout loading, the game play is not so bad but i really prefer not watch a bandicoot falling for at lease 2 minutes before i can start to do anything, this game got to me by the third level i am so happy i did not buy this crap well maybe it's good game but!!!!! i had not the time to find out the loading is major set apart from other flaws and i really thought that this version would have been more interactive well,this game is a set back for a PS2 game oh please!!!!!!! what with the 2D anyhow i won't buy this, so if you try this then take whatever  load of ???? you get laters folks/ gamers.	-1
This Game was terrible. The only new thing about this game was that Coco was fully playable but you don't get to play as her very often anyway.  Here's an overall view of the game:  The Positives:  -Good Graphics  -Good Bosses  -New Vehicles  The Negatives:  -Sucky Levels!  -Sucky Music  -It takes about a hour to load  -The Game is extremly hard  I heard there is a new Crash coming out later this year. All I can say is that I hope it will be good.	-1
Anyone remember back when Chuck Jones had created the successful "Road Runner" cartoons for WB, then WB shut down the studio... and later on, WB changed their minds, decided that they wanted more "Road Runner" cartoons after all... and got other artists to do them other than Chuck Jones himself? Remember how flat and terrible those new ones were compared to the original classics? Longtime fans of "Crash Bandicoot" will experience the same problem here. While it's true that the game is impressive on a technical level, it falls on its face concerning the actual character animation. The most appealing part of the Crash games, the wonderful cartoon visuals, look simply awful. Crash moves stiffly now and has none of the charm and charismatic appeal he showed in the earlier games. I swear, he looks and moves like a hunchback! Also, the facial expressions are stiff, his actions and movements are puppetish "just put him through the motions" mechanics, and he simply doesn't "live". The other characters are all animated the same way, and it kills the visual appeal. I won't complain about the obvious "loading time" problem, as it's already been discussed. As for the gameplay, while it would have been fun even though it's "same old, same old" if the animation was designed better, coupled with crude animation its lifeless. All is not lost, however--the wonderful Game Boy Advance title more than makes up for this mishap. But you'll most likely want to skip the PS2 version. Wait for the next one and see what happens to the concept then, and hope...	-1
Remember when Crash Bandicoot used to be fun?  Here comes a new generation of Crash!  Apparently his new developers thought that "fun" is a bad thing.  So they "improved" on the old one by making HUGE load times, terrible controls, and repeated everything WAY too much.  The only fun things where hardly ever presented.  If you have any other crash game.  ANY at all, you don't need this one.  It's just to boring.	-1
My little brother is a Crash fan. Personally i hate Crash games, they are all the same. When the Wrath of Cortex came out, my little brother bought it. I played it with my brother and boy was i bored. It is the same thing, even the same graphics and it takes like 2 minutes to load! Don't buy it!	-1
Have you ever gotten home and wanted to play that one game that you just got a new code for, don't do that with this game.  Unless that code makes the game load faster this game is annoying.  If this was the first game I played on the PS2 I would have returned the PS2, and gotten a Game Cube or X Box.  The graphics are not that great, and I hate the controls.  When controlling Crash you feel like you are in a BMW M5 convertible that can only go a top speed of 30mph because of an engine problem.  Everything about this game is slow.  I wonder if the people who made this game were slow in the head.  Other than that the game is fun.  It is another Crash game, nothing special.  But the loading kills the fun.	-1
Games, like every form of entertainment, are subjective so I would never tell anyone not to at least try something out.  I came really close this time.  Lets start with the load time--this practically cripples the game and makes the whole experience annoying.  The graphics, though not a big deal since really this game is for those into the CB series, did not impress me.  Movement of the characters has an annoyingly N64 like feel to it.  This was my second attempt at getting into the CB series and I think it will be my last.  Those into the series, which I am not, may find something appealing about it although I'm not sure what.	-1
One of my biggest dissapointments ever. Now I have never played the playstation version, so I can not compare the two, but this game was horrible. You start out in a small town, its being attacked by some evil family. So some chick turns you all to stone so you will not die, then she attacks this guy. All of a sudden your back in the huge building, and some guy says go on a quest. So you leave for no reason and have no info as to who you are, except you are part of the dragon clan. You go to the first town and you kill some dude in a castle. Now the king tells you "You are awesome!", and tells you to go to some town and find the quake control to stop the earthquakes. Not only was this task stupid, I do not even know why I did it, because I got no reward. Also, couldn't the king have sent his men to clear out the castle? So you go to the town at night and sneak in past the guards. Keep in mind you have not said one thing at all during the game. You kill a knight and turn off the quake control. Now you go back to the king and he says "You rock again! I am too lazy to give you anything so your a hero, now leave!". Then you go to some town and you learn the king is ill. So you play as Nina to go to some other place and get a remedy from a wizard. How did they know the wizard had a remedy? Then you get sent to help Nina kill him. Back at the castle, the king gets up and Nina says "I am going with Ryu because I need to stop evil in the world". So then you leave. Notice you have done 3 quests and got nothing but Nina. Not only do you have no info about who you are, you are given weird tasks that give you nothing in the end. I am still not sure anyone knows my name. This game is overrated. Also, there are too many random battles. You cannot walk 10 steps withouht having to fight some weak monster. Now if you want an RPG on the game boy advance, get Golden Sun. If you want an RPG that serves no purpose and seems like people made up as they created it, get Breath of Fire.	-1
This game is very short you can finish it in a few hours. One player missions are fun but two player is flat out boring... Enjoyed it for 8 hours... Found my self thinking that they developed a few levels then quit before they had a full blown game. ... you should get at least 5-7 days of play time instead of 5-7 hours.	-1
I regret buying this game not because is bad game at all but because in trying to free some some memory the system erased all my save game information on all my pS2 games and reformatted the memory card. the game seems to be a good game though.	-1
back in the ps2 times i used to like playing this game but know  that i see it for what it is its very limited you don't have much to do and the day ends very very very quickly giving you no time to explorer the very small town your in i have a fishing net but i cant go fishing for along time the graphic looked good and the music hooks you in but the expertise is just bad	-1
ok, i don't think i'm an "action junkie."  i like the sims 2, i don't play halo 2.  but this game is sloooooooooooow.  after a few minutes, i was sick of it.  also, no real tutorial to tell you what to do.  you just wake up in a room, with a cow milker in your inventory.  oh yay, i can go milk a cow!!! that right there is the pinnacle of gaming entertainment, my friends (sarcasm).  i liked the old sega genesis harvest moon better, where you have a nice full screen, no annoying 3d cameras.  you know you can water, harvest your crops, deal with your cows, go into town, etc.  simpler, faster, and more fun.  also this game has japanese-type graphics (i'm sorry, but there are a million anime titles out there, did they have to turn harvest moon into one??) and annoying townspeople that i hate.  i wish i had bought harvest moon: back to nature for PS back in the day.  now it costs $40 online, but it looks like it has that sega genesis harvest moon style that i like.  definitely skip this one!!!	-1
This game was alright but it wasn;t nearly as good as ANY of the other Harvest Moon games. Personally I hated it, and I'v been a Harvest Moon fan for quite some time. This game only gives you a sertain amount of time to complete. and then u start over again, with the same stuff u had... i'v "saved the homeland" as many times as you could and it didn;t seem to be/get any more interesting.	-1
If you have played with the previous Harvest Moon games, you can expect a similar experience in this version.  The storyline is very simple: You have to save the town (farm) from being turned into a theme park.  This game has not one...not two...not even three...but 9 ENDINGS, Each one being different. Why so many, you may be asking? I have no clue. The problem is that if you don't use a stradegy guide and/or an Action Replay/Gameshark, it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to unlock all 9 endings because you have to do specific things (ie 1st, give a tomato to ???, then go see the Harvest goddess, etc.)  Like I said before, If you have played with the previous Harvest Moon games, you can expect a similar experience in this version. You get to raise cows, chicken, horses, dog, etc. You can even upgrade your house. There are lots of shops in the game (maybe too many) and lots of people to talk to.  It takes FOREVER to save up money in this game. The day you get 1 Million (whatever currency the game uses), pigs can most probably fly.  Unfortunately, YOU CANNOT GET MARRIED! In every other Harvest Moon game, you can get married, even in the Super Nintendo version. This is a big disappointment.  The graphics are cell-shaded. This game  would have looked great in regular 3-D. Why couldn't they make this game regular 3-D? Once again, I have no clue.  Also, when it is nighttime in the game, it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to see.  Overall: This game is only for hardcore Harvest Moon gamers and PS2 game collectors (this game can be hard to find). Even if you like Harvest Moon but are not a hardcore Harvest Moon gamer, don't even rent this game. I like Harvest Moon, but this is a huge disappointment. Unfortunately, this is the only Harvest Moon game available for PS2. I give this game a 2 out of 5.  Second Opinion: 3/5 stars: This game is a disappointment to the Harvest Moon series, however nonetheless it is a lot of fun.	-1
This game has a great concept, lots of things to do, and a cute look. Why the low score? Well, the in-game time system is, in a word, wack. I would barely get outside and get my bearings, and it would be mid-afternoon already! Then, one time, I got lost trying to find a path in the "morning", and by the time I found it (a few real-world minutes later), it was "night"!! How am I ever supposed to build a farm and save the homeland if all the stores are closed by the time I get to them!? This game could have been Animal-Crossing caliber, but instead it's just confusing and weird. Too bad. I was really looking forward to it.	-1
If you want to get an HM game, get Back to Nature or A Wonderful Life. This has best or second best graphics, but not much else. The girls are pretty interesting, but you can't marry or date them. It doesn't have holidays, it only has 4 crops, few animals, and it's just not nearly as good as any of the other games. Rent it if you feel you must try it.	-1
I'm being a bit hard on this game because I was so disappointed. The other Harvest Moon games were much better as far as game play goes. The graphics were great - the characters looked very cute and childlike, adding to the charm of Harvest Moon. But it was a complete letdown to find that as soon as you "save the homeland" the year starts over back in spring (no matter what day of year it is) and no one in town seems to remember who you are. If you had a love interest, forget it. You have to introduce yourself to her all over again. So the idea of family life is squashed. Each time you save the town you get a new icon displayed on your saved game page. I have 3 and yet I still haven't made it to see a winter yet. You can only make a handful of recipes and they are too simple and boring. Nothing like the complex recipes that came with Back to Nature. You don't get to decide where your crops and grass grow either. It's already decided for you where your pasture will be, and your plots of soil are very uniformed and evenly set. I think this game will appeal more to younger children, but for the older fans of Harvest Moon, it just doesn't stack up.	-1
After playing it for awhile, I realize all you get to do is play with cows and chickens, and a dog if your lucky.  What a boar.  The "Harvest Land" in this game is so small I  wonder where all the memory went to.  Your main goals are to bake goods, farm the land, then attempt to earn money that way, so you can buy something to give as a "gift" to some townsfolk fool.  This way the townspeople will give you clues to go on stupid little adventures to get to one of nine stupid little endings to the game.  Oh, and if you miss their birthday don't expect any help.  Save up enough money and you can buy a kitchen for your crappy little shack, whoopie! Im sure glad I could get $11 for this game when I sold it.  Thats the best part of the game, getting rid of it.	-1
There's a reason this game is so cheap ( i found it for about $10-15)  It's a terrible game! Now, I almost never say that about games (most have something redeeming in it) but I am a die-hard Tetris Fan-Girl, and I found it, quite frankly, embarressing!  Just we're clear, this versian is for the GBA.  I picked it up, because I was excited to see that someone had finally made a color tetris game. When I turned it on, I noticed several things which disappointed me right off the bat.  There are several modes of play in this game, and only one which is "Plain-vanilla" tetris. Most of the modes are fun for a time, but only the classic tetris is even worth playing.  There are a few redeeming factors, but overall, being able to switch out your next piece (and "Hold" a favorite), and FINALLY being able to "quick drop" your piece instead of waiting as it drops, does not make up for the forgiving difficulty and distracting colors and backgrouds of theis game.  Several things prompted me to rate it so low.  One, there is no score-saving. Heck, there isn't any way to score the game at all! What fun is it when you can't even brag about your high score?  Two, the "infinate rotate" feature made it so you can continue to rotate a piece endlessly until you figured out where you wanted to set it.  Three, the "shadow block" makes it so that you can see where you your piece will drop. Makes the game too easy.  Those three items have effectively "broken" tetris for me! I promptly took the game back and requested a refund. Avoid this versian of tetris at all costs! If you must have a tetris fix, it's possible to find  the original for the gameboy under $10. (Even if it does stick out of your gba sp two inches!  Don't mess with the successful tetris formula!  Until a new versian comes out that addresses these issues, I'm sticking with my gb tetris!	-1
the worst tetris game ever next to the tetris worlds on all 3 major systems  lets face it finding nemo was by(thq)tetris worlds is by(thq)and i can go on and on  thq makes some of the worst games i have ever played stay away from them.the graphics suck the game doesnt even have a save feature to save your scores and its hard 2 play when stuff gets in your way when your tryin to drop peices its horrible	-1
I own this game, and it doesn't come close to its original (Harvest Moon 64)!  In Save the Homeland, you can't get married, there are no sheep, no festivals, no babies, the game ends after 1 year of play, you must work for a horse, and there aren't many fields to grow crops!  I must say though, the graphics are the best I have ever seen!  But I didn't think the graphics were worth the price for the game.  So, my opinion is, Don't get it!  If you don't have Harvest Moon64, spend your money on that!	-1
It's hard to believe that someone could make a version of Tetris that I wouldn't want to play, but here it is. Here are the problems: 1.  The animated backgrounds.  This is a killer.  Everything on screen is trying to distract you from playing the game.  Just a static image on the sides would have been great. 2.  The spin bug.  You can rotate a piece once it hits the bottom as often as you hit the button.  This means you can just keep spinning a piece around until you need to drop it.  No challenge. 3.  No battery.  A huge part of the game was trying to beat your old scores.  Also this means you can't save settings. 4.  Far too permissive default settings.  You get to see the next 3 pieces, and see an outline where the piece should go.  Want to change the settings?  You can, but you can't save it, so you have to do this *every time* you play the game. Everything about this game feels wrong.  The floating cube head mascot, the annoying backgrounds, and the lame attempts to change the gameplay.  I still use my copy of Tetris DX instead!  I just wish I could get a copy of Tetris DX in a gameboy advance cartridge, as it sticks out of my gameboy advance sp. Stay away from this game.  Hopefully the next Tetris will bring back the classic DX version, which was the best version of Tetris ever made, for any platform.	-1
I am a long time fan of Capcom's Mega Man X series, owning almost all of them, excluding the rare X3, which I only rented, and the new PSX2 Mega Man X7. Mega Man X-X3 on the SNES where just great, and Mega Man X4 was "mind-blowing" great. However, a strange thing started to happen, and it happened when X5 came out. X5 was decent, but the storyline became too far-fetched and anyone with a brain could tear holes in it. This is even way more apparent in X6. Now we have X6, and I'm just gonna flat out and say it is probably (well, actually) the worst in the series, no doubt. It is easy to tell this game was doomed from the beginning... Here are my basic arguments: #1. No English voice actors for cut scenes or battle cries! - this is just SO unforgivable, Mega Man is as much a US game icon as a Japanese icon, this a royal slap in the face compared to the awesome cut scenes in X4. Capcom obviously didn't want to spend the money - lazy, pure laziness. #2. The whole "Zero's missing/return" thing was so dumb. Capcom built this scenario up so much in X5 and X6 and failed to deliver any kind of interesting and credible reason for his return. I could write a better storyline, man! #3. Zero's new sword is just way too powerful, it shreds anything in seconds, like his crescent weapon in X5. Basically, he has no need to use the weapons he acquired at all, you're gonna kick butt with practically no effort at all, meaning no actual challenge. #4. Ok, I know some people are sick of Sigma, and yeah, it's unimaginative to put him in again, after building up the whole "Dr. Wily" thing in X5, but Gate was ten times worse. Gate and Isoc were lame enemies. You never even get to fight Isoc either! #5. The way you have to defeat High Max was so annoying and over complicated. #6. The so called "nightmare system" is really a nightmare. When I read about it, it sounded cool, but really doesn't add any challenge as it does controller-throwing frustration. #7. Zero's control scheme is now so screwed up; it leads to many "accidental" deaths, because the buttons have more than one command assigned to some of them. #8. The English translation (or attempted translation) is horrid, the worst I've seen since Breath of Fire II. How do misspell the hero's name Zerrrrrrrrrrro! as Zelllllllllo! #9. X6 easily has the worst selection of Mavericks (this time called "investigators") Come on! When you have a "dung beetle" as a boss, you know you have run out of ideas and a beating a dead horse! Some investigators are pathetically easy, others are insanely hard. And I though X5's Guns and Roses theme was bad. #10. Overall, the stages lack anykind of imagination. Some are way too short (the Weapon Lab), some are way too intense (Weapon Lab, Magma Area), and some are just annoying to no end (Central Museum and Laser Institute). #11. They butchered the animation for Zero's victory pose - no more thumbs up. #12. When I first heard that X would be able to access Zero's saber as a weapon I was a getty as a school girl, until I played and found out he can't wield it even half as fast as Zero could; let alone combo with it, making it almost completely worthless. In the end, Capcom did do a few things right. Some of the tunes are cool, especially the two they remixed from X and X2 (although some are really terrible, ex. Central Museum), and some of the new armors are cool (I loved the Ninja Armor!). It's a sad day for X fans, I never though I have to bash a Mega Man game this harshly. But what do you expect when they slapped it together so quickly ...	-1
I've been a fan of Megaman since I was nine (wow, back in the day of the Nintendo... I think mine still works.), and fondly remember my fandom for Megaman grow as I play MMIV, V, MMX, and Megaman X4.  More recently I've played the 3D Legends series and LOVE the fact it's so lighthearted, but I LOVED the melodrama of X4!  To return to the X series, I bought X6. Ack!  To my dismay, there was ZERO (as in NONE) animated cutscenes!  Only still screens of characters and Japanese Dialogue (which I actually prayed for over the horrible US voice overs in X4), with scrolling English.  How sad!!!  Plus the fact I found zero withtin an hour sort of poured cold water on my expectations of a plotline...  He used to be the COOL guy I wanted to play through the entire game in X4, but now he needs X to find all his powerups for him before he can even survive. :p Let's talk upgrades: I don't like the fact I have to find EVERY part of an armour to use it.  I find 6 pieces, but guess what? I'm still missing one from each.  Not to mention when I go back to revisit levels to find the missing pieces, the "Nightmare Effects" system annoys me even more.  Sure, it's fun (and almost surreal) to see nightmare Zero chasing you.  But it's just isn't challenging (it's ANNOYING) when they turn out the lights, making it impossible to see during certain levels (well, you can stand there long enough and wait for enemies to hit you first...)  Now I find myself having to restart the ENTIRE game because I didn't play the levels in the "correct" order since w/o boots for better jumps, I can't advance.. and yet with the Nightmare system on, I can't get the upgrades due to a) a big sliver block blocking my way to the capsule b)icy blocks impossible to advance unless I have a longer air dash ability c)I can't see a thing in the dark! Fans of the X series: play X4 again and wait for the next one.  This one is pure dissapointment.	-1
Don't waste your time or money.  Capcom ...has it become to known as has been releasing worse games then ever before.  X4 was one of the best Mega Man games in my opinion and after that they have just gotten worse.  X5 and 6 were obviously done by a different team of capcom then the previous games.  Its not very mega man like if you have played mega man games as long as I have which is 12 years you would know what I mean.  People who say this game is a 4 or 5 stars have no idea how good mega man games in the past were.  Capcom shows once again that they don't use enough testers for their games.  Its all about dead lines and getting the game on the shelf not putting effort into it.  Mega man is dead in my opinion due to the lack of effort and creativity in their games.  This game doesn't look like a mega man type of game from the game play and story line.	-1
I generally have high hopes for any 3-D platform game that features toadstools and fireflies.  We know that a fairly detailed and colorful 3-D world can be created on a PS (1 or 2), and games like the three Spyro games did just that, with smooth gameplay and beautiful backgrounds.  This game, however, does none of those things.  Although his is a Playstation TWO game, the graphics are rather flat and lifeless, especially in the early levels, which is where you want to capture players' interests.  The potential for vivid, colorful detail on the PS2 is far beyond what this game accomplishes -- this looks more like an early PS1 game. The most frustrating part of this game has got to be its tendency to freeze up, get stuck, or block your view.  Very sloppy programming.  Within five minutes of starting the game, Frogger's head was STUCK IN A BOAT while he was swimming underwater, forcing me to retart from the beginning.  Then, once again about five minutes in he got stuck in MIDAIR and I had to start over again.  Meanwhile, the incredibly choppy movement does not feel smooth or natural at all.  I spent most of my time accidentally jumping into the water because the "jump" is fairly difficult to control.  The storyline and dialogue are rather lifeless as well and I find myself turning the volume down so I don't have to hear the same two or three lines, like "I know Frog-fu!" over and over again.  I imagine that a child playing this game would be as irritated as I am by having to start over again and again when it inevitably gets "stuck"...and kids who have played other PS2 platformers like Jak and Daxter will probably be disappointed by the dull gameplay.  Younger kids, or those who have not played the better platformers, would probably still find it enjoyable.  Exploring the 3-D environments and picking up colorful gems and jewels always has a certain amount of appeal, but this is definitely a renter, and I lost interest long before my five days were up.	-1
IN a word, aweful.  Despite all the hype before it was released, this game is the pits.  Why?  The controlls are jerky and annoying, the camera gets stuck and lost, you cannot save during a board, the cutscenes are unintelligible, it is pointlessly hard--I must have spent 2 hours trying to jump on a railing to ring a bell the railing was right in front of me but since he hops, it is purely random, lastly THE GAME GETS CONSTANTLY STUCK-- for example, if you jump from under an island (and you spend most of your time swimming)you get stuck inside the graphic of the island, and there is no escape!!! And since you cannot save the game during a board, just at the end, if you get stuck on a puzzle, or trying to jump on a railing, or to keep from getting stuck in computer limbo, it is purely maddening!!! Instead, try Jak and Daxter (I am not a developer or in any way affiliated with any game company...etc..) The most fun I've had since I first played Spyro the Dragon!! WHen oh when is there going to be a new game for PS2....  I cannot recommend Jak and Daxter enough--everything this game gets wrong, it gets right. If you rented Frogger, you would stop playing after an hour. I'm sure there is a worse game for PS2, but I can't think of what it could be	-1
I rented this because Frogger was my wife's favoriate game on PS1. We were excited to play this. After about an hour, it was back in the case. This is NOTHING like the PS1 model, it is a direct rip-off of Mario Brothers in 3-D. But it's not even as good as Mario. It's just a frog running around trying to get as many coins as possible. If you like Mario Brothers, you'll like this. It's a good choice if PS2 is your only system. If you're looking for what frogger is known for, you'll have to wait until the next one.	-1
I fail to see how Konami could release such a terrible game.  Don't even think about renting it because you will want your money back.  It's terrible with a capital T.  It has the word bad written all over it.  Don't even bother to look at the cover, stay far away.	-1
Not this!  If you are looking for a game.  Do not get this!  It has horrible controls and camera, lots frame-rate slowdown, extremely short, and it has a bad plot.  So if someone says they want or bought this game your reply should be not this!  The one good thing is there are 80+ characters.	-1
a BIG disappointment.....frogger is practicly impossible to control, the graphics are grainy, I never get headaches from playing a video game but this one will give you a migrain! the extreme jerky movements and the way the view gets thrown off from the slightest odd jump will make you want to smash this game! not to mention the "story" ...all it is ..."once upon a time there was a frog who rescued a princess from some goblins and when she kissed him he turned into a prince" so un-original! also there is only 5-6 hours of game play! and most of this is running around trying to find out what on earth you are supposed to do! but the worst turn off is the errors. this is what I mean by they didn't finish it! you will often find your self stuck in some invisible wall usually the sounds go bonkers, or you wait there until some enemy finishes you off. another one is enemies getting stuck in wood, rock or something so you can't kill them and again the sound goes bonkers. but the worst of all is when the game totally freezes! then you have to re-start your ps2 and of course the game....I gave it 2 stars only because it had some OK game play but it deserves 0.	-1
In December of 1996 I purchased a Sony Playstation, finally upgrading from the old Sega Genesis.  One of the first things I did was to try and find a football game that was as exciting and fun to play as College Football's National Championship for the Genesis.  To this day, that still is one of the best football video games ever made for any console. This game was not available for the PSX.  For me it essentially boiled down to either Madden '97 or NFL Gameday '97.  I gave both a try, but settled for Gameday.  First of all, I was never a real Madden enthusiast.  In fact I did not own a Madden title until Madden 98 for the PSX.  That year I ended up getting Madden over Gameday because I thought it had more depth than the 1998 version of Gameday.  Since then I've bought Madden simply because there has not been decent competition in terms of football sims.  Madden is obviously not without its flaws (see my review for Madden 2002 for the PS2), but simply put there has been no other viable alternative for people like me who are looking for football sims. Why I do I tell you this?  Because I want it to be understood up front that I am not a single-minded Madden zealot.  When i first heard that Sega was making NFL 2K2 for the PS2, I was elated because I knew that 2K1 for the Dreamcast was hailed.  Further pushing my anticipation was the memory of playing the old College Football game on the Genesis.  If they put the effort into 2K2 that they did in the old College Football game, I knew this was going to be a great game. Let's just say that Sega gets a B for effort, but they fall short in execution. GRAPHICS - 8  As a person who has very little knowledge of actualy computer operations, it's my opinion that graphically 2K2 does match up with Madden.  I think the animations are, for the most part, pretty strong, with very little shimmering.  However, in the close-ups you can still see that the animations need a little refinement. AUDIO - 9 In my opinion, 2K2 supercedes Madden in the audio department.  If for no other reason, you don't have to listen to Madden drone on and languish through the same limited collection of phrases that he's been using in this series since 1999.  The audio is timely and keeps with the gameplay very well.  In my opinion, 2K2 really outdoes Madden in this department. GAMEPLAY - 4  Where it really breaks down is the gameplay, however.  Players tend to skate across the field and the physics simply don't match up against Madden.  For example, I've had receivers run 10 yard hooks only to be knocked clear back to the line of scrimmage after catching the ball for gains of maybe 2-3 yards.  This is simply not realistic.  In the no huddle offense, the team magically appears at the line of scrimmage instead of realistically trying to catch up from the original line of scrimmage. The AI is somewhat awkward, too.  I've been playing with Michael Vick at QB, and it's nearly impossible for him to get any mustard on a ball throwing off his back foot...and he's got one of the strongest arms in the league!  Meanwhile, the mild-armed Brian Griese - controlled by the computer - routinely drills 40 yard bullets accurately downfield off of his back foot.  What gives?? But the largest gap between Madden and 2K2 is in the respective franchise modes.  Say what you want about Madden, but anyone looking for a realistic franchise play would certainly be taken aback by the grand depth of the Madden mode.  The 2K2 Franchise Mode is woefully inadequate. For example... 1. Players are rated in 5 areas specific to their respective positions using a bar graph for each trait.  In Madden there are countless traits on which players are measured. 2. Players are not assigned colleges or universities in the college draft. 3. At the end of a season there's nothing that tells you how much a player has progressed (or regressed) from the previous season. You know it happens, but you pretty much have to memorize your players' individual ratings in order to determine how far they've advanced. 4. There do not seem to be any player awards at the end of the season (e.g. MVP, Rookie of the Year, etc.) 5. Once you enter the next season activities (i.e. re-signing players, making trades, drafting), there is nothing that shows you what the draft order will be.  This is critical if you're trying to trade up to pick up that franchise player or to trade down to get more picks.  In order to do this, you have to write down the order from the season before. 6. I've played 9 seasons now and the salary cap has not increased. 7. Although I've not tinkered around enough with it yet, it does not appear that you can use created players or teams in the franchise mode. 8. The retirement times of players is not realistic.  Jamal Lewis retired after 6 seasons in the league.  Keith Brooking retired after only his 7th. There are 2 things that I DO like about Sega's franchise: 1. You can actually trade future draft picks. 2. Players' overall ratings actually ebb and flow throughout the course of the season. I bought this game after reading only a couple of reviews, mainly because I have been less than satisfied with Madden this year.  I was genuinely hoping that NFL 2K2 would take my mind off of the flaws with Madden, but it's only made me appreciate more what Madden offers. Admittedly, some of my frustration is based in the fact that I am learning to play a new football game and that it will take some time to adjust.  But in my opinion, if you're looking for an actual football sim, Madden and the many options it provides through its complex and deep franchise mode is the better alternative. But I anticipate a better product from Sega in 2002 and will gladly give it another whirl.	-1
I may be alone in my thinking but this game is worse than NBA 2k for Dreamcast. To start off with the free throw shooting system is very hard to use,ive tried endlessly to line up the two arrows with the basket,having never succeeded. There are other reasons why I don't like this game,but i won't go into all of them.to be fair this game has gorgeous graphics and the player likenesses are the best i have seen.	-1
EA sports said this was gonna be a improved sequal.  As far as I'm concernd, this game is bull...!How come the center scores the most?(Like Shaq scores 93 points, and Kobe only scores about 12 or 14 in a 48 minute game)  And Why when you're ahead by 21, the other team comes back like its nothin'?!  And the other team steals the ball way too much.  It also seems the other team keeps gettin' offensive rebounds, 'till they get there way.  If I were u don't waste money on a piece...like this.  The only thing good about it is it will keep ya entertaind when u board ....Git 2001 it was better.	-1
Many hoops fans seem weary of Michael Jordan's comeback. THey say he's too old, too slow, and the Wizards are too bad of a team. Eager to see for myself how Air might fare, i played with the Wizards against the Lakers and won by 40 in my first game. Then i ratcheted up the difficulty and still won by 30. Finally, i turned it all the way up to the Superstar level. You know, that's where the computer steals the ball by just looking at you. The margin:Wizards over Lakers by 10, despite one of the ugliest displays of computer cheating i've seen since NFL Blitz made me fumble away a 21 point lead. Now, if i could beat the game when using a bad team on the hardest difficulty level, then Jordan can make a glorious comeback...In NBA lives world, at least, where zone defenses are as sturdy as warm butter, rebounds are handled like wet soap, and a pin point alley oop pass from scrub Marcus Fizer is thrown down by dinosaur Charles Oakley. Five times. In one game. It surprised me that this plays so unrealistically after seeing how great the players look on the court, especially when they show emotion while driving the lane or bitching at a ref. Even Dr J's fro is sweetly 3d rendered on the classic All Star teams. It feels like EA Sports focused on beefing up the fancy graphics and features and hoped we would overlook the rest. That might be enough to drive an arcadey slam fest, but NBA street fits that bill so much better.	-1
I rented it and it is no better than last years which stinks.  I am about ready to give up on there ever being a good NBA BBall game besides NBA Street which is not even 5 vs 5.  Don't waste your money on this.	-1
I have seen a lot better basketball games from EA sports. I have played this game and cant find 1 good thing about it. The camera angles are just plain horrible whilethe gameplay is just as bad. Every shot you take is a rim ball. No swishes or shots off the backboard. I don't know about you but ill wait till nba 2k2 comes out in February. EA sports should be ashamed of themslves.	-1
I've been a big fan of most of EA Sport's titles throughout the years and this one is a huge disappointment. I love their new NHL hockey and the NCAA football, but his game's quality is questionable at best. In last year's version the had great graphics and good gameplay . . . but only half the cars on the track; a concern for some. I thought it to be entertaining. This year, at the expense of gameplay and graphics, they have a full pack of cars. But the end result is terrible. Inacurate handling of the cars and chippy (at best) game rate where the grandstands click by as if is was a PS one game. I owned it for two days trying to find some worth in it but, alas, could find no redeeming qualities in it and I sold it to someone who has a PS2 but no TV . . . the best way to enjoy it if you want to own it.	-1
After renting this Nascar title and many others I have noticed that that gameplay has become harder with every new release. For a beginner racer I would suggest Nascar Heat, for medium racers the EA sports title Nascar 2001, but for somebody who needs a challenge I would say that Nascar Thunder is the right game. In Nascar 2001 the racing style is almost the same, but I was winning every race, but with Nascar thunder I was having trouble not being in last place even when holding X the whole race! I was slightly mad because the fact that if you wish to make your own racing can that it takes a very long time, many many savings numerous loadings and trouble with corperate ads on my race can. 2 stars is my review.	-1
This game's packaging made it look promising, but while the graphics are beautiful, the linearity of the "puzzle" solving astounded me (I have NEVER played a game before that required such an absolutely linear progression) and the puzzles were far, far too simple for experienced gamers.  I had my pad of paper and pencil all ready, and only ONCE did I actually record any information there.  My husband and I (we always play games as a team) were also amused by the fact that while you retrace this man's steps from his journey in the 1930s, at each step of the way, you pick up a computer disk to help you to the next stage.  Marvelous 1930s technology, those computer disks.  Even for one of the mass-produced games coming out of Dreamcatcher, this one was disappointing.	-1
I'm sorry, I cant slap on the kudos that the other Syphon Filter die hards did for this version. I thought Syphon Filter 1 was the best console game available when it came out, Period. Really good first person action and controls that were superbly responsive. Syphon Filter 2 came on 2 CDs and was truly massive with lots of well thought out sections and excellent challenges. Syphon Filter 3 is exactly what I said it is. A series of OK to Lame leftovers they didn't think were worth including in 1 and 2. In case you didn't know, the company that produced one and two sold out before three and it is completely obvious that the people who cludged together 3 were using the leftovers. One and two broke a lot of new ground and the increased scale of two alone justifies it, but 3 does nothing new and is kind of like one of those Death Wish 13 movies. They really should have stopped at two in this case. This even came in a 2 cd box (with only one CD and a lame little meaningless pamphlet) They obviously had more planned, but decided just to exploit Syphon Filter fans instead, [taking money] out of them before they learned the truth. Sorry Guys, your first two were great, but this one is pure financial exploitation. MGS2 on the PS2 is intriguing, but really wordy and a little strained in the control department even if you don't like true first person as much as I do. However, Halo on the Xbox is the new best console shooter, Period! Played through Heroic level, hard but great fun. Legendary is continuous Suicide, also Period. If you like shooters, it is time to move on.	-1
I, being the nerdy Batman fan I am, was of course drawn to this game, allured by the ability to roam Gotham City and use all his cool gadgets.  But I was sadly mistaken.  First off, you can't simply "roam around Gotham," like how you can roam Liberty City in GTA III.  The levels play more like an obstical course, negaiting the use of the 3-d graphics.  His gadgets are a huge let down; his grappler(the thing he shoots a coard from and pulls him up) can only be used at certain points, and it tells you when, so it takes some of that fun away from it.  These things are enough to ruin the game.  But there's more.  The controls are absolutely hellish.  Certain things can only be done at certain times, the combat system is sluggish and very unresponsive (try nailing one of those special moves.  HA HA!  Like that'll ever happen!) not to mention extreamly anticlimactic.  I even cheated using my Game Shark, but it didn't even work!  Basicly, as suggested by my title, rent it first, and if you like it, you'll probably stay that way.  I disliked it from the beginning, and I've been pretty consistant. The one plus in this game is the cinamatics.  They're better quality than they were on TV, and it also saves them in a file, so you can rewatch them at your leasure (something I REALLY wish Final Fantasy would do). Bottom line, this could be a good game to the right person, but I certainly don't care for it.	-1
This game makes your PS2 shine graphically but the poor controls and limited scope of action will drive you nuts.  Batman will fall from catwalks so easily and miss doorways so often that you almost think he is still in training.  The gameplay is okay, but you are scripted in what you can do, so this is limiting.  I would say rent, but do not buy.	-1
The graphics are nice but like everyone says, graphics alone aren't enough to make a game good. While it's not a terrible game, it's mediocre at best.  The storyline is mostly forgettable--literally--I don't even remember most of it. I though I remembered it but it turns out I was remembering the one from Season of Flame (which isn't that great of a game either but definitely better than Season of Ice).  The gameplay is awful. The controls are lousy and the level design is haphazard. These factors with the need to run after thieves and "Activate the 5 " make hunting for collectibles very frustrating. It's very easy to die by falling off the map or into the water, bottomless pit, etc. I noticed that I had SOMEWHAT better luck on the  Game Boy Player with the GameCube controller but not much. It's just not well designed at all. Stick with Spyro games for console.	-1
I have all the Spyro games for PS1 & PS2, and I LOVE them, so when I got my GBA I bought Season Of Ice right away....and was very annoyed.  At first I thought it would be cool, because there are fairies and mermaids, but the controls are much more difficult on the GBA than the Playstations.  I have trouble getting Spyro to go the direction I want him to, especially on diagonals.  I think it's because you're using directional buttons instead of a joystick.  I don't think it can be the fault of the button on my individual GBA, because I bought it brand new and this is one of the first games I've played on it.  Anyway, I have trouble crossing bridges and just moving around in general; it makes it incredibly obnoxious, because every time you fall in water you die.  I say, if you have a Game Cube and a Game Boy Player (so you can use a joystick) this could be a great game, but if you just have a GBA, don't bother, it's more frustrating than it's worth.	-1
This is a bad title. Spyro games always used to be fun, but that tradition ends here. Camera angles are bad, the grpahics are very dark, and the whole thing is just another lame kiddie game.	-1
I purchased this game because I'd played the original Jade Cocoon and liked it.  I'd already read reviews about Jade Cocoon 2, so I knew it wouldn't be like the original.  Still, I never expected it to be so bad.  I wasn't even able to finish the game.  I even picked it up again (after awhile of inactivity) to try to force myself to finish it, but I couldn't.  I really did consider finishing it to see if it got any better, but after reading numerous reviews/faqs/wikipedia, I realized that it wasn't going to get better.  So, rather than trudge through the rest of this abysmal game, I decided that I'd better quit before I wasted any more of my life.  I don't normally write reviews for games I haven't finished, but I really feel like I need to share my opinion on this one so I can inform others of what they might be getting into if they buy this game.  It's really not any one thing alone that makes this game unbearable; it's a combination of several things that bogs it down.  Well, let's take a look...  Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics themselves are technically decent, but not really too impressive.  Music (score 4/10): Ouch. Music is incredibly bland and generic. I almost didn't notice that there was music.  The voice actors try their best to invigorate the terrible dialogue, but many fail.  Furthermore, some voices chosen for characters were incredibly irritating--especially the voice of that guy who stores items for you.  Characters (score 4/10): Remember how I mentioned the crummy dialogue earlier?  Well, this really ruins the characters.  Dialogue is VERY repetitive (a lot like the rest of this game).  Kahu repeats every statement made to him back in the form of a question.  "Kahu, you need to get the forest orbs." --"So, I need to get the forest orbs?"  Urg!  This sort of exchange happens constantly.  Kahu seems to be amazingly stupid.  While other characters are amusing in a small way (like Yamu) it doesn't save this section from a poor score since most everyone is either gratuitously stupid or simply poorly developed.  Story (score 2/10): Talk about non-existent.  What little story that exists is incredibly trite.  Kahu wants to become a beast hunter but then he gets cursed for touching a fairy cocoon.  Now he must collect 4 forest orbs to lift the curse.  There are several subplots along the way, but none of them are particularly interesting.  The story really suffers from the pace of it (slow) and the way it's told.  The bits of story are revealed by talking to people in the dungeons.  Sometimes there is a scene (mostly monologues by the fairy Nico), but mostly it consists of simply exchanging a conversation.  There wouldn't be anything wrong with this if it were paced better.  But the game drags on and on forever, with a lot of level grinding.  This really slows the story to a snail's pace and makes you forget why you are even playing this game.  With all this you'd think the gameplay made up for it, right? Well, let's see.  Battle System (score 5/10): This part's not so bad, but it does have its irritating bits.  Selecting attacks is turn-based, and battle involves having several monsters arranged on a wheel surrounding Kahu.  They can only carry one move for each element, and then can only use the move of the element that they are placed on in the wheel.  Furthermore, you can't choose which enemy the monster attacks--it's random.  Plus, monsters can only use their moves that take up MP; they only use normal attacks once their MP runs out.  That makes for a frustrating experience. Otherwise, I would've been fine with the battle system.  Gameplay (score 1/10): Repetitive is the word of the day.  There is only one "town" (and it's dull).  Dungeons are long and boring, and each one looks just like the others, only a different color.  There was just no variety--and in a game that's basically a dungeon-crawler, this is bad.  To make matters worse, the monster raising system is very unrewarding.  When you merge a monster, the appearance doesn't even change (unlike the original Jade Cocoon).  Further, monsters stop leveling up at level 20, forcing you to merge them, which resets their levels to 1.  This really ruins any sense of accomplishment you had, because monsters revert to their weak-looking baby forms. It really sucks the fun out of the game.  Overall (score 2/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Sigh, the first couple hours of this game are really fun-- before you get sick of it, that is. I wasn't able to force myself to finish this game, and I don't see why I should have to.  A game is supposed to be for fun, not something I should force myself to do.  I just don't think I could recommend this game to anyone--except maybe the most diehard of dungeon-crawling fans.	-1
The short version: Pokemon [take-off]. The detailed version: The original Jade Coccoon is one of my favorite console games ever, along with Final Fantasy 6. When I saw an ad for JC2, I was aglow with delight. I read the reviews, I downloaded the previews and comercials, etc. I bought the game. I started complaining. This is a rather sad sequel to what was a very good game. I think it's very revealing that this game was *only* released in the US, and *not* Japan, where the first was more popular. This game was designed to sell to young American kids who think Pokemon is fun, and it makes this very obvious. The game play is OK. In JC2, Divine Beast breading is more like an industry. Some elements of the original carry over, which is neat. The portrayal of Levant a thousand years after Mahbu died is very interresting. Ra, Mu, and Kikinak are also back. I also have to ashamedly admit, I like the sassy fairy. The graphics are quite good, and the music is good. The plot is almost non-existant. The first game delt with issues like "why does man suffer?" and the fall from grace of both Man and Spirits. The sequel deals with such thought-provoking issues as "Kahu likes girls, but they think he's a dweeb". Late in the game, there are a few points where the plot gets interresting, and there is some very good dialogue. Then, it's as if the writers thought, "Oh, no! Too much thought! We'll loose the interest of sponge-brained American children! New scene! New scene!" For light entertainment, this game is OK. If you think Pokemon is cool, you'll probably like this game. If you want something as good as the original, the total selling-out to the Pokemon mentality will sorely dissapoint you. I was waiting throughout the game for any of the characters to use the prase, "Gotta Catch 'em All!" (Thankfully, they didn't, but I would hear it in my head every time I'd play.)	-1
is you have the standart version of the console, this don't work , beware!	-1
I don't see the point of buying a remote control for your PS2 when you can use your controller to play DVDs. to me a product like this is a waste of money.	-1
I desperately wanted to like this game. As a strategy RPG, Hoshigami occupies a very niche corner of the video game world. Truthfully, I'm obsessed with strategy RPGs, and I'm always eager to devour new ones (which are rare, you see). Games like Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, two titles which heavily influence Hoshigami, are some of my all-time favorites. I love them for their exciting battles and elaborate character micromanagement systems. So, when I started up Hoshigami, I was impressed. It looks pretty good (along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics), the story is interesting, and it seems intelligently designed, intricate, and difficult. I love a challenge. But I was betrayed...as I played further, Hoshigami became a chore, subject to a stupid loophole in the gameplay that made the entire thing quite ridiculous (I will explain below). The big 'innovation' here is the RAP system. Each character has RAP points, which are consumed by executing actions (movement, attacks, etc.) I can see how a system like this could be applied to enhance the game's strategy, but something went wrong. In the end, the system only empowers certain characters to make an extra attack or move a few more spaces every turn. All that really happens is you end up pressing the button a few more times every turn, which makes already slow battles slower. Oh my. Why not just give a character more movement? More attacks? Spells appear on little goodies called Coinfeigms. You can equip characters with Coinfeigms, and elective magic is an idea I really like. The number of Coinfeigms to be collected is very impressive, too. However, they are entirely useless. For all the game's difficulty, spells imbued in Coinfeigms are hopelessly underpowered. Further evidence that spells are completely unavailing is found in the fact that as I played through the game, none of my characters were ever slain by an enemy's spell. In Hoshigami's polytheistic world, your characters develop skills by following a specific god and gaining powers through devotion. Devotion levels rise just like experience levels, so fighting makes you more devoted, getting you more abilities...right? Right. This was a very intriguing idea (unique skills according to different gods), but the developers messed up. Firstly, it takes forever to raise your levels. The stretches between levels are long, long, LONG. Secondly, the skills you earn with higher devotion levels are almost always useless. These two things make the game very difficult. And I mean VERY difficult. Anyone who plays Hoshigami is sure to get slaughtered several times in the first few battles. The enemies are far more powerful than your team, and you are almost always outnumbered. Plus, if a character dies, he's dead -- resurrection only becomes possible much later in the game. Initially, I was glad for a challenge, but there is a fine line between "challenging" and "morbidly frustrating"...and Hoshigami crosses that line. The only _apparent_ way to strengthen your party is to enter the Towers of Trial, which serve as training grounds for your characters. The Towers made me want to kill myself, quite honestly. They are stunningly boring, with repetitive battle maps, monsters, and everything else. I didn't want to train in these Towers, which were degenerating my sanity, but how else could I be match for the game's ridiculously hard battles? So I discovered the "stupid loophole" I mentioned above. Instead of using a full team of characters, I used just two: Fazz (the main character) and one other mercenary. My mercenary would be a dummy fighter to draw enemy attacks while Fazz did the fighting. Usually my mercenary would get killed quickly, but I could always hire a more powerful one later. Even if the mercenary survived, any experience he gained would still leave him at a level lower than another mercenary I hire, so there was no point in keeping him. The beauty of it all? Fazz accrued 99% of the experience and became a death machine. It was mildly difficult at first, but soon I was able to kill most enemies in one or two hits. It became even easier when my weapon of choice became a bow & arrow so I could kill from a distance. Suddenly, a viciously difficult game became mindlessly easy. I must say, I don't like strategy RPGs to be "mindless." I pushed on to the end to see what would happen in the moderately entertaining story, but the gameplay was probably making me stupider with every battle. Granted, the fact that I could defeat 15 enemies with just two characters was somewhat amusing for a few battles, but it became very boring, very quickly. A game that is too difficult is not fun. A game that is too easy is not fun either. With Hoshigami, it's either too easy or too difficult -- either way, it's not fun. Get Tactics Ogre on GBA and skip Hoshigami.	-1

The goal of the game is very simple as is typical of a 2D platformer. Spongebob must collect items at the very end of the level to get ready for Patrick's birthday party. The graphics are good. The MAJOR drawback of this game is the TERRIBLE controls, which makes the game play almost unenjoyable. For one, it is easy to slip off a platform. Also, you are collecting spatulas for health, but everytime you get hit by an enemy, you lose most of your spatulas. If you get hit and have 0 spatulas, you die. There are only 3 continues, but the continues are worthless since they take you back to the beginning of the level! On the plus side, your game is saved after completing each level, and the game itself is relatively short.	-1
I thought about buying this game. I'm glad that I didn't. My little brother let me borrow his copy of the game. I am glad that I played his copy before buying this piece of trash. It is a shame to rip off little kids like this. There is *~NO~* action at all. All SpongeBob does is jump around. Can we say a captail BOARING!! Don't waste your time or your money on this piece of trash. I love the SpongeBob game for Game Boy Color. I can't wate to try the SpongeBob game for PS2 (Playstation 2) and the GBA (Game Boy Advance). I bought my little brother SpongeBob for Game Boy Color and he let me play it I just LOVE it and I am not a fan of SPongeBob's. I don't watch the show. I will only watch it if my little brother is watching it. I would have given this game zero stars but that is not an option.	-1
Don't let the cover and ads for this game fool you, Real War is really poor as real time strategy (RTS) games go.  Even though it is advertised as being based on a Joint Chiefs of Staff training game, Simon and Schuster Interactive has put out a highly inaccurate game with poor replay value.  The most intriguing part of this game is its storyline, an all-too current battle of America versus terrorists.  That's where the comparison stops.  Unlike the Al-Qaeda, the Real War's evil-doer's, Independent Liberation Army, have access to Tomahawk missile launching Cruisers, Attack Aircraft Carriers, and seemingly limitless ground assets of moderate complexity.   The saving grace for this game is its interface.  It is easy to zoom in and out to keep track of you units.  This game is best enjoyed by your seven-year old nephew who does not have a grasp of the destuctiveness of modern weapons.  Case in pont, it is entertaining watching an infantry unit sprint Carl Lewis-like in the open past a Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) with .50 caliber machine firing away.  The infantryman will typically last 20-30 seconds.  Moreover, tanks blast away at each other often sustaining more than three or four direct hits before there armor gives way.  Lastly, a missile from a cruiser will hit a helicopter or plane and do only moderate damage.  The weapons effects are higly innacurate and remove all doubt as to the overall quality of this game.   Sadly, Red Alert is still the most accurate game at combining joint land, sea, and air units.  However, if you wish for an incredible game of ground combat, without infantry, your best bet is JoWood's excellent production World War III: Black Gold.	-1
I bought this to play along with Gran Turismo 3 because I thought it would make this better.  I was wrong.  The steering wheel is so tight that it makes it difficult to turn the wheel.  Finding a spot to set it down is even more difficult.  It takes a long time to get used to using the wheel and the foot pedals.  It didn't make playing the games any better.  Luckily I was able to return it.	-1
This is the worse PS2 game I've ever played.  The graphics are 3rd rate and are far below many PSOne games. The camera movement was so jerky that it hurt my eyes after about 5 minutes of play. My son and I stopped playing and never had an interest in playing again. There are much better games available like FFX.	-1
Almost every night, I sit here and wonder why we have so many video games in the world.  What makes this game even worse is the fact that it really wants to be a Mario Kart game.  We already have Mario Kart, so this game is pointless.  This game continues to get worse the more I play it.  Good luck trying to control your vehicle.  I was never able to do that.  I kept crashing and wouldn't be able to win any of the races.  I really want you to avoid this game.	-1
... If you want to make your kid cry this is a good way: 1. Confusing and counterintuitive interface 2. Difficult steering of the car 3. Cheating opponents enhance educational value 4. Impossible to win races 5. Your characters steals some car parts to make the game even more educational Ironically enough the developer company is called "Attention to Detail" Attention to what ???????????	-1
I grew up playing all the wwe games this is by far the worse one they have came out with. Bad season mode bad roster bad graphics skip this game and get shut your mouth way bettter selection.	-1
WELL, THIS GAME AIN'T NOTHIN BUT A PS2 VERSION OF SMACKDOWN 2. AND THIS GAME AIN'T EVEN BETTER THAN THAT! THERE'S A LOT OF NEWER WWE WRESTLERS TO CHOOSE FROM, BUT THE GAME IS VERY UNINTERESTING, HAS BAD COMMENTARY DURING MATCHES, AND THE CONTROLS ARE STILL BAD. THIS IS THE WORST OF THE SMACKDOWN SERIES AND THIS WAS THE WWE'S PS2 DEBUT. THE GRAPHICS ARE ALSO PRETTY BAD TOO.	-1
When this game was first released, I was pleased.  I rented it, then put it on my personal "to buy" list.  After I (finally) purchased it, I spent several months watching my created wrestlers (CAWs) in action.  I said "watching" because I wasn't very good at actually playing the game.  I would let the COM be all the characters.  Eventually, I tried playing the Story Mode.  Boy, was I in for a surprise. First, it's almost impossible to perform a Top Rope maneuver.  By the time your guy physically gets on the turnbuckle, the opponent gets up. The second problem is opponent recognition.  In a match with several opponents, you have to manually make your character focus on the person you want.  Imagine how frustrating this can be with up to 6 other folks on the screen (including the referee). The third problem is the Story Mode.  I guess THQ attempted to fix their previous Story problems from SD1 and SD2 by offering very brief scenarios.  On one had, this is good because you can unlock things faster.  On the other hand, it gets very repetitive very, VERY quickly.  You can't skip the cut scenes, and all the characters use the same movements. Next issue is the load times.  Alone, the load isn't long, around 12 seconds.  But I often want to make fast changes to my CAWs.  Those 12 seconds add up very quickly. But the straw that broke the government mule's back is the programming bugs.  I spent over a week unlocking items.  Then I made a CAW with a certain pre-made move set.  This particular bug causes the game to FREEZE once loaded.  I later learned that other bugs are in the game.  There are way to counter-act the problem, but only if you know about the bug first.  After you save, there is NO WAY TO FIX IT!! Now, I have to delete all my hard work and start from scratch.  I don't want to unlocking stuff all over again.  I'll be getting a Gameshark soon.  If I can't unlock everything with that, I'm going to sell my game. PS: The game takes up over 3,000 bytes of Memory Card space.	-1
Let's see what makes this a BAD game, shall we?    1. "Commentary"   A commentary is when two guys are sitting at a table near the ring, and talk about some stuff OTHER than the current match.  Tazz and Cole's so-called "commentary" is laughable and repeats the same phases.  Tazz and Cole are emotionless and sound like computers that need to find an acting coach.  They sound like this: There will be no interferring in the....single match.   2. What the hell are they chewing on?!   EVERY character in this game looks like they're chewing tobacco or something.   3.  Auto-Lock, Please!   I've played WWF No Mercy for the N64, and it had a clever little system.  Everytime you get it, your character would turn towards the character that hit you.  WWF Smackdown! doesn't have an auto-lock on.   4. Create a Character   Okay, this is one of the stupidest systems for creating a wrestler.  You don't get to pick any of the moves, just looks and clothing.   5.  NO EASY SETTING!!   WWF Smachdown! is HARD and doesn't appear to have a "easy" setting.  The computer is relentless and doesn't leave you alone to recover from the last attack.   6. LOOKS    Some characters don't look like the wrestlers in the real WWF.  For example, Stone Cold. 'nuff said.    7. Nobody Talks!   The only two who talk are the computerized voices of Tazz and Cole. All in all, this is the worst wrestling game ever made.	-1
Yea at the time it had the story line right. And yea the game has a high replay value. But this game is HARD even on easy this game is hard. The story mode is long and repeditive. I mean don't get me wrong i am a hard core WWf fan but this game is shame full. Stone cold does not look like stone cold. The entrances are correct but in no way long enough. And the "commentary is laughable not at times but thought the hoel game.	-1
If you want a somewhat good wrestling game, consider ditching your junky PS2 and get a real game game console - XBOX! and get yourself WWF RAW, where there is at least some resemblence between the game models and the real wrestlers.	-1
I must say I am very disappointed in this game. For the PS2 they should have carried out their promises to the fans. Their storyline section is horrible. You have like 4 matches tops depending on what you pick as a storyline choices-Previous Smackdown games have a season mode where you can continuously play as a character as you unlock levels. Here you have to finish multiple storylines in order to unlock wrestlers and movie segments. Lame if you ask me. The Create a PPV is gone as well which is sad. I loved making those. You can't interfere during a wrestlers entrance. The only thing you have is improved graphics...Thats nice but for the PS2 there should be more. If you want to get a WWF game, buy Smackdown 2 for Playstation and enjoy !!!	-1
This game is just like Crazy Taxi except done in the most horrific way possible...  1 out of 5 stars!  This game had like no good gameplay except pick up people and drop em off and a very short story mode...Which is also crap...  Nothing really to do except listening to annoying bad music which isn't even good and really really bad gameplay....  Hit and Run is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better then this malarchy....  1 out 5 HORRIBLE GAME!  Lates..	-1
This game is pretty boring. It's just like Crazy Taxi, just with the Simpsons as the cast. The game is just the same thing over and over again, you pick up passengers and drop them of at the designated area in the time limit you are given, so the game is to repeticious. I rarely play it anymore. The only thing I really liked were some of the silly things that the characters said, other than that, there's no reason to get this game.	-1
THis game had so much potential, but the designers just didn't put any thought into it. For example, in the special tasks games, why not have a level where otto has to pick up kids at bus stops? instead, mindless crashing into barrels and picking up characters over and over and over again with nothing to keep you interested. it's barely worth a rental. I love the show but the game just doesn't do anything for me.	-1
I am a die hard Simpsons fan and it's really hard to write this review. The second I heard about this game, I thought it would be really cool and I wanted it. When I got it and played it for a while, I discovered that it was not fun at all. To unlock more cars and characters, you have to pick people up and drop them off at different destinations. This gets very dull and repetitive. The only other thing can do in this game is these ten missions that are mainly composed of collecting or destroying objects in a time limit with no reward. Oh yeah, there this Sunday Drive thing which is picking and dropping people off with no time limit. In fact, the only thing positive I can say about this game is that some of the voiceovers are funny.	-1
This game is cool if you like the Simpsons (which I do) it won't matter if you like this game or not.  EA uses the Simpons to sell another driving game that is kinda like crazy tazi in Springfield. This game is ok but not great.	-1
If you compare this game to hit and run, well... you just cant.  Do not paly this game after playing hit and run.  THis game is so unrealistic that it is boring.  You can play as a lot of different players and there are many different people to drive but it's just so repetitive.  In the road rage all you do is drive people back and forth.  They didn't even put time into making the level right.  in mission mode you do different missions, but once again they are very repetitive.  If your friend recommends this game (like mine) make sure to rent it before you buy it.  Because if you do buy it you will probably just end up selling it here. rating out of ten: 2 1/2 - 3	-1
I sold it back in 6 days with everything unlocked.  Story mode is a joke, no replay value at all.  I'll take my chances with Legends of Wrestling.	-1
I have to say I expected a lot more from this title.  Comparing it to the past 2 for the PSone it appears that THQ still doesn't have a working model for the story or career mode.  I was able to unlock 96% of the secrets in 1 1/2 hours.  The grapics are good and the load times are quick (saving is agonizing).  Create a wrestler mode is as deep as ever, moves included.  However I just can't get over how weak the Story mode is, 5 matches max and your story is over.  Then you have to start over with the same drawn out FMV scenario and limited choices.  You will play yourself out of this in a few hours.  Then really what are you left with?  Exhibition matches?  No thanks THQ.	-1
The novelty of this game wears off very quickly. At first it was fun to play as several of the Simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the 50th time it became mighty tedious and tiresome. The gameplay is very simple. If GTA: Vice City is the Lego Technic of road rage games then Simpsons: Road Rage is, without a doubt the Lego Duplo. It is SOOO aimed at kids. No one over the age of 13 will be particularly impressed with this. It's just far to `safe'. The Simpsons TV show is full of satirical humor and intelligence but this game is just a cheap spin-off aimed at a much younger audience.	-1
Anyone from Minneapolis or Montreal is likely to play this game and think it's a simulation of driving in either of those cities with the added attraction of extreme property damage. I had debated buying this game for many months and while I am a huge Simpsons fan, many of the PS2 games I have played have been really awful. In fact, from where I stand, about one game in ten is worth playing, much less actually own it. I also usually try to never pay full price of a PS2 game if I can and if that means waiting for it to be reduced in price or made a `Greatest Hits' title, then so be it.  `The Simpsons: Road Rage' is one of those games. I can't imagine anyone paying full price for this game, playing it and think it was a good bargain. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game on the same level that `Time Splitters' was a bad game, rather there just isn't enough to do but pick people up and drop them off somewhere else as quickly as possible or running things down in the so-called `Mission Mode'. Destroying stuff would be at least be visually pleasing if when you crashed into something, instead of the polygon model breaking apart, it exploded like most things in the Simpsons (rabbits, Chief Wiggum in a garbage can), I mean, how many times has a car crashed in the Simpsons and NOT exploded? Right, about 4 times.  What's worse is it isn't even that funny. The dialog never seems strained, the actors do their part wonderfully, rather what they say isn't going to win any Emmies. My question here is, in 14 seasons of the Simpsons there have been about 10,000 really funny lines and even if only 5% pertained to cars and driving, they could have just sampled them and stuck them into the game. But no, we get lines like "Everyone's a psycho but me." from Lisa or "You'd make me the happiest Christian in the world if you could take me to the church!" from Flanders. Would have been so hard to go to Gracie Films and borrow some of their writers for this game in order to get some GOOD lines? Funny video games are possible, anyone remember `Sam and Max Hit the Road'?  Also, the game presents some funny glitches, like two Apu's standing on opposite sides of the street waiting to be picked up. Or the time when driving as Bart I dropped Marge off at the `She She Lounge'. I found Marge waiting to be picked up in the middle of Lake Springfield standing on an island. Later, I found Krusty waiting there as well. Graphics are so-so. A mixed bag of great character models and detailed locations seen in the show, but almost everything else is pretty low-rez and over anti-aliased. Some buildings don't even have textures on all sides. The physics model actually isn't that bad and I wish cars in Gran Tourismo handled as well as the ones in the game do. In that vein, all cars drive and handle the same- whether it's Bart's soap box racer or Marge's Canyonaro.  As a Simpsons fan I can barely justify the twenty clams I laid out for this game. It will actually be worth it when it gets to half that.	-1
Normally, I'm a big fan of the Simpsons but this game really did no justice to the name. Aside from the snide remarks that the Simpsons crew throws out constantly (which in my opinion is the only entertaining bit to this game), the game is very repetitive and boring. The graphics were very choppy and sloppy. It was like time turned back, it was 1983 and I was playing Pac-Man on my Atari. It plays like Crazy Taxi, which too, was also a bad driving game. This is really not a game for the older gamers but kids will enjoy this very much because of it's simplicity. I hated it but maybe you'll like it. Have fun and Happy gaming!	-1
Once sentence captures it all - "Pretty lame - Millhouse".  (For those who are Simpson illiterates, that's Mrs. Krabapple describing Millhouse's science fair project.  Millhouse bellows "Behold the power of gravity!", and then lets a slinky step once down a ramp.) There are so many great games that I wish they would copy and insert Simpsons characters in.  The only time I ever played Doom on the PC was when someone installed the Simpson?s wad.  To be Homer Simpson and to fight giant Flanders throwing Bibles at you me was great fun.  Of course, when they blatantly copied a game, they had to blatantly copy one of the worst games out there - Crazy Taxi.  Why couldn't they copy something good, like Grand Theft Auto 3.  They could have had a hit with Grand Theft Donut. The fact it's the Simpsons and you drive through Springfield is pretty cool.  That's about it.  The 10 missions levels are decent enough to finish, but aren't exactly fun.  The graphics are decent, and they actually have the characters speak which is somewhat fun, though not clever or laugh out loud funny. The main game consists of getting money to unlock cars and levels and to get one million dollars.  Each time you go through a run, you gain about $6000.  The run takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.  Every 20-30 grand, you can unlock a new level or a new character.  The unfortunate thing is that after 10 rounds, you've done pretty much all there is to do, and the novelty factor wears off.  I got up to $70,000 before being thoroughly bored with this game.  There was no way I was going to unlock all six levels and all seventeen characters.  No way would I even consider trying to get one million dollars, the monotony would have killed me. The Simpsons' Road Rage is a game that gets old really, really fast.  It's fun for about 5 hours max.  Rent it if you're curious, but you'll be disappointed.	-1
This game is a fun concept, and the Simpsons references and sounds are great, but it takes FOREVER to load!  And then you finish a level, and it takes FOREVER again.  And then you start another level, another ETERNITY of a delay.  It felt like I was back on a Commodore 64.  Maybe worth a rental, but don't buy!	-1
My first TH game i got was THPS4. I grew up on the games that followed 4. I played the first 2 games on a friends PS1. When I bought the 3rd installment and played it, I quickly got burned out and bored of the Career mode.  Being used to the freeform style of 4's and the rests Career/Story, i just couldn get used to the Time Trials of the first three games. I liked the THPS1 game for what it was: "okay this is cool". 2nd game: "pretty similar, looks nice" .. But by the 3rd i just got tired of the format. Literally nothing changed but the character models, and levels.  Oh, don't forget about the REVERT!	-1
Item was so damaged that it could even be repaired. Scratches were pretty deep and there is a crack on the end of the disk extending about one-eighth inch inward. Makes good wall art. So,I said well sometimes that happens when purchasing used stuff and decided to try again. The second one played fine until I reached the 14th mission(about half way through).Guess what...Hopefully this one can be repaired.	-1
I think there is a reason why accurate flight simulators are few and far between on the consoles. With only a few buttons, a d-pad, and thumb-sticks on a controller, there isn't a great deal of input choices that would make up for a keyboard and full-blown flight stick. Flight sim developers are plane nuts and they strive for accuracy, many gaining access to the real aircraft, even taking test flights in them. Ace Combat 4 is not such a game. It's a fun romp through a campaign across a fictional nation that much is certain, but it has all the depth of a wading pool.  Combat is a simple matter of simply getting close enough to lock up an enemy plane and firing a missile while evading an incoming missile is as easy as turning and breaking. Also I know for a fact that real world aircraft do not carry upwards of 82 missiles.  Flight dynamics are a joke; there is little difference between piloting an A-10 Thunderbolt or a F-15, characteristically, both air craft handle pretty much the same, save that the F-15 is faster. Realism goes out the window as one can usually out-maneuver an F-16 in an F-4; whereas in reality an F-16 would fly circles around the venerable Phantom. Aside from carrying five or six times the missile load out, missiles themselves are equally good at shooting down aircraft as they are blowing up tanks and hardened targets like bunkers. Fire a Sidewinder or a Sparrow at a modern battle tank and even providing you could hit it, the missile might scratch the paint. There's a great difference between aircraft aluminum and layered and ablative chobham tank armor. Bombs are equally weird, Mk-82 500 lb GBs seem to shoot out of your aircraft as if launched from a cannon. When doing a bombing run you can actually see them fly on ahead of you towards their target.  What also got me was how useless the M-61 20mm gattling gun is on most aircraft. I did a little research  a few years ago and found that the cannon is incredibly accurate. Its spread pattern of 1-3 meters, even at two or three thousand meters range, indicates a 60 to 90% hit ratio. In Ace Combat 4 however, it's a bullet hose with all the accuracy of Fox News. The real weapon is so accurate because its muzzle velocity is so high, and thus overcomes gravity and wind resistance to a greater degree. In other words, shooting down another aircraft is very difficult, because you have to hit it so many times and providing you can maintain a close target lock long enough to pump enough rounds into it. This includes the A-10s 30mm Avenger cannon, the depleted uranium slugs of which will chew up battleship hull armor.  These are pretty glaring faults for a game, but despite these, I found myself enjoying the game a great deal on my first play through. I liked the story as told by a young boy whose village is under enemy occupation. I generally like games that let you pick and choose what aircraft and weapons you wish to fly for each mission that is if you have earned enough money to buy such aircraft to give yourself that kind of choice. Each mission gives a series of objectives that must be met to earn cash, a little like anime `Area 88' where mercenaries on both sides battle in the skies over Africa, and use earned money to buy new planes or repair their existing aircraft. You also get a boatload of weapons; various bombs- guided and otherwise, laser guided Mavericks, and Phoenix missiles- which are actually really cool, because when armed, they lock up everything in front of you. And when you fire, you launch as many missiles as you have targeted aircraft.  So, from a realism aspect, Ace Combat 4 misses the carrier deck by such a wide margin that it's in a completely different ocean. I can accept that; because it's fun. And fun is the name of the game. Going after the massive guns of the Stonehenge base and racing down the Death Start II tunnel system to wipe out Monolith, is darn cool. The lack of mission outline, the fact that missions are timed, and the fact that mission's objectives are handled pell-mell; is not. The plane graphics are great, and the landscape images are good from a distance. The combat chatter is fun, but you don't get to hear enemy in your cockpit in real life. Ace Combat 4 is a fun game, but a long, long way from being a real flight simulator or even accurate.	-1
This game stinks. The graphics aren't that great and the control is terrible, making it hard to play. Activision should make a new game, instead of concentrating on Tony Hawk this, Tony Hawk that. Tony Hawk 1 and 2 are more enjoyable.	-1
THPS2 was fun. The levels made sense, the physics were completely unreal (fun) and the locations had some sort of skatepark or something interesting going on. The locations in THPS3 are lacking. A few are fun, but the majority are chaotic and seem to be designed purely with aggravation in mind. The airport is a great example. The physics have changed for the worse. You feel like your controlling a big sack of lead, and you will fall constantly. The controls are not configurable, and the setup for doing tricks is more a game of hitting things in the correct sequence than any sort of creative use of the terrain. On the technical side, this is one of two PS2 games I've seen crash. Shipping a game that crashes is totally unacceptable, but this level of workmanship seems to be a major theme in THPS3. Overall I'm pretty annoyed with my purchase, and would recommend staying away from this title. Don't even waste your money on a rental. Hopefully some developer as talented as the SSX people will come out with a good skater.	-1
Do not buy this. It sounds like a good price, but even for double the memory at half the price it would (be bad).  This is basically an 8MB memory card because in order to get the 16MB out of it, you have to compress and decompress every time you want to use it if you fill the card with memory.  And that's not the worst part.  EVERY time you put in a different disc, or hit reset, or turn the power from off to on, you have to insert the disc that comes with this card, let it load, pick your memory card, then eject, keeping the power on, and insert your game. If you don't do one of these steps, you have to start all over again because your game won't recognize that you have a memory card.  If you don't mind waiting 5 minutes every time you want to play a game, then this memory card works fine. But, come on, PS2 takes long enough to load a game already.  You don't need this.  A better purchase would be two 8MB card for ...more.  If I had been on the job when I first used this, I would have made that ...by the time I started my game anyway because it took me a couple of tries to wade through the obscure instructions.  One positive: if it seems you can never find the time to clip your toenails, this purchase may be for you.	-1
... This memory card holds twice as much space as the official Sony card, but isn't worth it. It is a pain to use this. You have to load up a disc to use the card. It is annoying to have to keep loading up a disc when you want to play. With the Sony card, you don't need to load anything. This card is also very unreliable, because most of the time, it will, and I repeat will corrupt your game saves. If you were to buy this, I would only keep it as backup, never to use it. I would rather spend 50 dollars and gets 16 MB's of Sony than the Interact. Wait until Sony releases a bigger card. If you think about it, 8 MBs is a lot, when most of the games usually don't require more than 300 kb. You can definetely fit 25-30 games that aren't sports (Madden, NBA 2k2, All Star Baseball 2003, etc.). Sony's card is a must buy!	-1
This game requires that you insert software and go through a series of motions to start a game.  So basically, it turns a simple thing like turning on the PS2 into an annoying little exercise that requires you to babysit the console for at least a minues.  Of course, the box mentions nothing of this, and successfully hides the CD that you need place in you console at the start of the powercycle.  Worst of all, the package is designed in such a way that in order to even discover this, you'd have to tear apart the plastic box, making it impossible to return. Granted, it works, but it's just damn annoying.  Would you buy a car if it required you to crank start the vehicle?  Would you at least want to know about?  At least it's readily available, unlike other useful memory cards.  Of course the main selling point is that it contains 16MB of data.  Who cares?  Does anyone really use up all their 8MB memory card? Needless to say, the second I saw a Sony memory card, I grabbed that and never used this piece of garbage again. Even if you don't mind the extra annoyance of the loading time, you should NOT buy this product.  It will only encourage companies to deceive customers.	-1
You must boot with the included software *every* time you want to play a game.  That [stinks].  Do not buy it because the lower price and additional memory are not worth the extra hassle!	-1
I recently bought a PS2. When I bought the console, I also purchased this 16MB memory card because it was cheap, had a lot of memory, and was the only one the store had at the time. When I got home, I put in 007 Agent Under Fire and the memory card. When I tried to play my game, the memory card wouldn't work. I printed some instructions from Interact's website, and I discovered that you had to use the disc that came with the memory card every time you wanted to turned off the PS2. I tried to get it to work, and it didn't work this time either. I took it back the next day and got my money back. This memory card is CRAP! I then bought a Sony-made 8MB memory card. Pay $5 more, and get the 8MB memory card. You can save without the hassle, and you can fit over 9 games to one card! Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!	-1
!WARNING! Do not buy this memory card. This memory card is a complete waste of your money. I would recomend Sony's 8mb memory card. So this reveiw is practicly just a warning. !WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!	-1
I bought this game, played it for a night, and returned it to get Ghost Recon (which happened to ROCK). Pros: -It's playable out of the box. I used to not care about this so much, but now I don't expect every game to work right away. How tragic. -The graphics are excellent. I was very impressed. -The game is very original. Resources like water and rice that grows make the game more interesting. The unit alchemy is a very new concept. Horses are really cool in the game. Cons: -All in all, the game wasn't all the fun after a while. I just went back to playing Civ 3 and Dark Age of Camelot. -The battles, though they look cool, are not fun to fight. -The resource cap is VERY annoying. -The unit alchemy system means that making all of your peasants into the top unit is really all you need to do to dominate. There is no reason to diversify your troops.	-1
Spider-man 1 was ok, but their sequal was a SHIP WRECK. All the "thugs" say is "your web-swinging days are over" or"goodbye good-doer" which isn't even a word! This makes you turn the sounds off, and their are no subtitles to find out what you really need. Plus, all the bad guys use the same attacks, so one strategie wins the game. Plus, it did not exsplain what was left un-exsplained in the first game. That's what a makes a sequal good! Playing it waskind of fun, but it got boooooring! I guess you could rent it....but don't buy it! It is not worth all that money!	-1
This game is a slap in the face of existing Heroes fans. What were the programmers thinking? It's an absolute debacle! First of all, the combat is ridiculous. There's no hex grids, no room for tactics, and the concept of having heroes in battle, unless they are very powerful, is absurd since they are easily killed. Laying seige to a castle is a complete joke, since there's no way you can knock down walls (the only way through is the gate) and there's these ridiculous pillars behind the walls that give a huge advantage to the player who owns the castle. What's really missing in this game is immersion, which existed in both Heroes 2 & 3 and made them such excellent games. Heroes 4 however feels empty for a number of reasons. Buildings are ridiculously expensive. There's no more 'wait until the end of the week' for new creatures - they replenish sporadically. You must CHOOSE between which armies you'd like to have populate your castle, eg, choosing Champions means you can't have Angels, and choosing Monks means you can't have Crusaders. There's no upgrades possible for units. You just get them and away you go. The hero system is stupid and biased. When you're weak you too easy to kill, wheny you're strong you're too hard to kill. Learning skills takes forever and even at level 25 you've only learned half of what you're able to. The game looks too flashy and the layout is way too complicated. So much for simple looking graphics - it's hard to see exactly what's going on now. Ultimately, Heroes 4 is a total disaster with so many things wrong with it there's no way a Heroes fan could possibly like it. As for people giving it 5 stars... they're probably just looking for 'helpful votes'. Listen to the rest of the people who have bagged this game and AVOID IT ENTIRELY!	-1
Whereas I have been enthralled by the series up to this point and was seriously excited about the new 3-D screen and other updates, I find myself sorely disappointed by the final product. Gripes: -New adventure screen is a bit hard to see as the objects are all a pastel and tend to blend in a little with the pastel backgrounds.  Also the adventure screen seems cluttered and tight, and opening up to the highest resolution makes everything too small to see, so you need to stay on about 800 X 600. -The combat engine is in need of a boot to the head!  What used to be cool animations in 2D has turned into some lame unit drawings who lumber around the field and take swings at each other.  The spell animations have also lost something in the translation, as they seem very cheesy and amateurish. -The pace of the game seems to have gone way down.  Either the maps are too big, or there isn't enough to do, but sad as it is, the game is a little BORING in comparison to prior versions (III especially, which was great.) Go back to the drawing board and put back what was taken out for the principle of progress.  Instead of the next generation, we got the retro-Atari interface version . . . Too bad <weeping> . . .	-1
the game cheats during car chases no mater how fast u chase the car you never catch because car cheats and speeds up and enemys respawn cutting you off over and over the ai cheats and does not die when hit the enemy is too aggresive and shoots without reloading	-1
When I got this game it is pretty cool, but I'm use to inverting my controller, but this game does not have this choice. So I'm missing shots like crazy. It too a long time to get use to, i don't think I'm use to it yet still. so if you you use invert in all your games you maybe frustrated playing this game.	-1
i have never played the previous bond games.  however, i know that as a game it is an [imitation].  the map design is sophomoric at best try Deus EX instead for a real experience with covert first person shooting/role playing.	-1
I just reviewed Night Fire (far superior) and realized I missed this one. I wish I had missed it at the store too. This is definetly a rental. The game just doesn't feel right from start to finish. My biggest complaint is weapons fire. It doesn't feel like really firing a weapon. It's more like your shooting noise maker that spits out little tracers. This game had so much potential, it's to bad. However, Bonds face is better in this one than in Night Fire (Bronson on Botax). EA should stick to the Generic Bond face like in this one. The role is about to change anyway (Jude Law anyone).	-1
Regardless about whatever anyone else tells me, The World Is Not Enough is still pretty much the best Bond game (and one of the best console shooters out there). I was hoping that Agent Under Fire would steal my heart, but it broke it instead. Gameplay 2/5 The single player mode is very straightforward and short. The AI is nothing short of atrocious, and the entire game basically revolves around, "Here's a bad guy, shoot him". Your dull witted opponents will simply stand there and wait for you send him to his maker. The multiplayer was also somewhat dissapointing, with the crappy AI, dull stages, and boring weapons. Remember the huge rocket launcher that could be fired rapidly and was laser guided? They had to take that out, and replace it with just a simple rocket launcher with no appeal. Sound 4/5 The music is outstanding, as well as the voice acting, but occasionally plagued by cheesy dialogue. Innovation 2/5 The driving and turret stages were different, but totally lame and repetitive, and, as I mentioned, the weapons are totally dull when you compare it to The World Is Not Enough, or any other Bond game, for that matter. Graphics 3/5 Very pretty, but with lame explosions, and the characters move like robots. And why don't you have any hands? Replay value 2.5/5 Two fairly decent multiplayer levels and an unsatisfying single player will make you quit before you even finish. Let's hope EA does justice to the series and does a better job with Nightfire, or give the liscense to someone else.	-1
I love the look and feel of THE POWERPUFF GIRLS on TV, and had high hopes for this game. The 3D CG animated opening, which basically copies that of the cartoon, is really fun and enjoyable. That, with the inclusion of all the major PPG villains, made me think I was in for some fun. The game aspires to be something more than just your average fighting game, with it's use of all three girls and playpen style fighting arena. There are power-ups and props which are crucial to fighting, along with some special moves and character taunts. But with all that, plus reasonable PS1 graphics, the game is still a bit sluggish on the controls and quickly repetitive. I wish this game has faster controls, more varied gameplay, and a more involved use of the cartoon's sound fx for both the game and the interface. It could have been much cuter, I think.	-1
The conquest for any big-screen to PS2-screen game is just simply to be good.  The plots always become to developed without you actually doing anything to invoke it, just shooting some people, and sitting through a cut scene.  This game is no exception.  There seems to be no storyline continuing into the actual gameplay, just the cut scenes.  The levels don't allow any exploring.  Further more, even though I enjoy an easy, fairly quick game, AUF takes both of those to extremes.  If you're good, these measly 11 levels can be beaten in 2 hours. There are two good parts though.  The controls are good, allowing you to scroll through Q's gadgets easily.  The second is the multiplayer mode, with about ten unique environments, and cool weapons. Overall:  Buy only for the multiplayer mode.	-1
My brother beat this game for a friend it is horrible. The enemies are dumb the gameplay is easy and unchallenging. My brother got up to the halfway point of the game in like 1 and a half hour. The story does not deserve the title of bond. I thought this might be a good game. The shooting enemeis is like shooting poorly made slow robots with pittiful IQ. Pros: Great graphics   A wide supply of gadgets Cons: Pittiful Enemy AI   Car missions are reppetetive   Very short   Very Easy   Horrible story   Boring Gameplay   Isn't faithful to bond's style   Combat is Basicly shooting slow and dumb enemies   Bad gun design   Average Multi Player	-1
I used to own an N64 and I'd play Goldeneye for hours at a time by myself or in the excellent multiplayer mode.  As the first game on my new PS2 system, I prepared myself to be wowed by 007.  And at first I was.  The controls aren't as intuitive as Goldeneye, but the incredible graphics made up for that.  Unfortunately, my excitement soon decayed into boredom as the inerrant auto-aim took care of all of my enemies.  Run into a room, hold down "X" and you win.  There's body armor all over the place so you can't die, and you can get shot a thousand times in the face with an automatic weapon and not even whimper.  In other words, this game was no challenge at all. As for the multiplayer... possibly the worst multiplayer of any game ever.  Again, the auto-aim lets you kill your friends with thoughtless ease.  The only good scenario is one in which you must either protect or kill a VIP.  Hours of fun in that one, though. Save your money.  ...	-1
This game was an utter disappointment.  The music is absolutely terrible (possibly the worst of any video game).  And the graphics are retro looking.  Come on, with the power that the Xbox has I thought the graphics would be better.  The game is extremely difficult and is dull and lacks excitement.  The missions are all basically the same as eachother, which is to eliminate the enemy planes.  Don't run out and buy.  Rent it if you feel like it's something you'd like, but don't buy it unless you've rented and liked it.  I returned after the first day of having it.  My suggestion would be to buy a game worth the money, like Halo or Max Payne or anything but this.	-1
which do you like.  if you choose "good," go to the order sheet for Maden 2002, or NFL 2k2, both going to the x-box.  This game focusses on graphics also found in the other options, but the others have perfect gameplay mechanics, judging by the similar games found on other systems.  Its you choice, good or bad.	-1
i have had this game for a long time and it was so horrible i didn`t even want to write a review on it, but then i thought other people would get the game thinking it will be good like the first one ( well i thought the first one was good). the game sounds great with 70+ cars and over 90 add on parts but they realy don`t do that much to the car's handleing. the grafics arn`t the best but they are ok. But one of the things that made me realy mad was they took ford out of the companys on the list for cars and they had some of the best cars for off road racing. it is impossible to win a race because the controlls are hard and the other cars seem to go at least 10 miles an hour faster than you even the exact same car. i have a cheat to get 1,000,000 dollars and you can`t buy those specialized racing cars without doing so many races even if you have the money and i put all of the most exspensive parts and the best parts to help me increase my speed but i still lost and i am very good at racing like on the first one and on other racing games. so i would not recomend this to any one at all.	-1
I suppose the great review are from people who just got their XBox and were impressed with it. I'm sure after playing the game awile they reflected on their 5 stars with dismay. No game that freezes for a full second during a race should get 5 stars. You can get $$ in competition, but not if your friends join in. Why on earth only 2 players instead of 4? 16 player mode could have been too hard, but surely 4 would have been easy enuf. If anyone has had 4X4 on their computer, they will be dissapointed. I was anticipating more parts than before, and I don't count 9 different types of Winch's as a great improvement. It's a fun and addicting game, but they should have done alot better at making a sequel. I played it for about 6 hours before I got the fever, and reloaded it on my computer to play the best 4X4 I have, The original, it played online too..	-1
I am a big halo fan . I ordered  it for my xbox and it didn't  work it also had a cracked in the center  of the disk.	-1
Great	-1
Didn't like it, wrong game. My bad. Didn't read, needed game for Xbox 360.	-1
The cars are sweet.  The graphics are sweet.  Too bad racing is just ... in here.  This game is wayyyy too hard.  I cant even get past some of the tracks in easy difficulty.  Not a good game though you gotta love the cars	-1
This game is not realistic racing you can barely turn if you are going over 10 miles per Hour around a curve which happens alot. And then you CAN'T EVEN CRASH you just bounce off the other car like it's a rubber ball. PLEASE Do not even rent this game unless you just love almost every racing game thats been made!!	-1
Im being honest here, i don't understand how this game got good reviews here ... I didn't like this game as much as I thought I would. The value of the Cons outweigh the value of the Pros tremendously. The Pros that were enjoyable were the awesome graphics, the system of advancement is mature and the ability to race with your own music. The problem is the major cons. While there are stylish things in the game, the GAMEPLAY (TOTALLY) [is bad]. It feels like I'm driving a turtle, The cars don't go fast at all. I thought something must be wrong as I couldn't believe how slow the cars go at top speed. It's so slow it's almost silly. and I agree about the controlling the cars as some others said, its a nuisance. I mean it shouldnt be so ridiculous. I just want to race, go fast and have fun. If you played Splashdown (awesome gameplay) you will know what I mean. The cars don't race smoothly and it isn't practical for a game. For example, you cant turn with even medium speed. You have to let go of the gas way ahead and brake completely (almost coming to a full stop) when turning. The bottom line is that yes there are cool things about the game but nothing is more important than the gameplay and it totally [bad]. As a note, I rented this game and i certainly wouldn't buy it. If you want to know what i mean by awesome gameplay for racing see "Splashdown". The engineers did an awesome job, somehow they've combined difficulty with fun and awesome speed. I completed the career and have played it so many times and I can play it all day because the racing itself is just pure fun. That's how a race game should be unlike Project Gotham. I would've gave the game a 1 but I gave it a 2 only for cool graphics, and music support.	-1
I bought this game a couple days after I got my Xbox because I saw all the screen shots and read all the reviews for it. Boy were they wrong!! Whoever reviewed this game and praised it for being one of the best racers ever was smoking ... Sure I'll agree the graphics almost can't be beat, but I wanted a racer with more than just good graphics. I don't know what I hate more about this game, the repeatitive tracks or the cars that handle like a Mac truck. You can't hardly win a race in this game at all, not even with a fast car. I found the Beatle blowing me away in a Audi TT. This game doesn't even give you the chance to feel like you're racing because you are constantly slamming on the brakes to make another turn. Also dragging this game to the bottomless abyss is the inabillity to upgrade your cars...what the [heck] are the ... kudos for if you don't have to buy the cars (you win them instead) and you can't upgrade them! If you want a fun race game buy Need For Speed: High Stakes for Playstation. The graphics might not be as great, but it's a fun game and you can upgrade your cars to make them look and performe like a car should.	-1
this game is not fullfilling the graphics are terrible and all you have to do it put in a simple code and you beat it...if you like racing games (which i dont) you will find this game frustrating and hard...for once in my lifetime I am telling you not to buy this xbox game...	-1
First off, these were used disks and I knew that going In. I had to return the first set since they would not play at all. The vendor replaced them without a hassle and I would buy from them again. The second set plays but is really slow to load. The screen sits there so long you wonder if it's frozen then, suddenly, it loads. Once it does start, it is fine for the duration.  Again, these are used disks so, do not expect them to perform like new.	-1
PGR is second rate compared to Rallisport. Rallisport is more fun, better graphics, better sound, better controls. PGR does have cooler cars thought because most of them are consumer cars as opposed to just Rally cars, which most people have never heard of. The background in PGR are very boring and stagnant, hurried to get done before release date.	-1
The controls are extremly hard to use and the game is extreamly hard I didn't like the game at all.	-1
When I saw trailers for this game, something looked really fishy, and when I finally bought the game and played it myself, I found the problem. This game seems to have some serrious bugs having to do with the steering. Not only this, but the game is down right impossible, and you have to earn every conflabbed car! Also, when you earn "kudos" the game takes a while to process the information, and, finally, when your are done sliding or whatever, you start again, and if you hit a wall after that, a matter of seconds after you are DONE sliding, you will lose all of your earned kudos from that, and all of that hard work vanishes into dust. Also, back to the steering, the game seems to slip and slide very easily, even if you just tap the stick at 90 mph... the biggest complaint though is that this game was supposed to take ADVANTAGE of the system, with great graphics, this game is laggy, slow, and has terrible gameplay. Don't make the mistake that I did with this game. This is a horrible game on the xbox, and it makes me feel one more ounce of anger that the xbox couldn't shape up the games that came out on release. There have been many games so far on the xbox that have been eye candy. DON'T BUY THIS GAME! YOU WILL REGRET IT LATER!	-1
remember MSR for dreamcast.  Obviously not, if you cam to the buying screen.  It was an awkward racing game, boasting innovative ideas, that failed.  The graphics were nice, but the game wasn't fun.  I instintly was reminded of that game while reading about Project G.  Then i read it is the same development team.  ...	-1
Ok, so I'm a little late to the Halo party. I mean, after all, the game I am about to review is 9 years old and was one of the original Xbox launch titles. But I'll tell you what happened. Way back in the day when I was just a brussel sprout of a lad I had an Atari 2600 (or was it the Sears version?). Then I got an NES, then a Sega Genesis when I started college, I think around 1992? But after the Genesis, I sorta drifted away from gaming for over a decade. It wasn't until Christmas 2004 that I bought a PS2. So during the period 1994-2004, I didn't really pay much attention to games. So since the Xbox came out in 2001 along with Halo, I missed the whole phenomenon. That's not to say I wasn't aware of it. My dad bought an Xbox and Halo back in 2001, and I remember playing through its opening sequence, but nothing else. When Halo 3 came out, it made me want to go back to the start of the series, so I began playing this game then. I got about 75% of the game completed and just sorta drifted away from it. Now that Halo Reach is coming out, I wanted to finish it once and for all and played the last 3 hours or so of the game.  First things first is that there's not a lot of story IN the first Halo game. What little backstory you can glean is in the instruction manual, but doesn't really give you a feel for the universe's mythology. I'm currently reading the prequel novel Halo: The Fall of Reach and would highly recommend reading it before starting this game. Or I guess you could just play Halo Reach in about 2 weeks.  In the far future, humanity has mastered interstellar travel and has moved to colonize other worlds and systems. Earth has become unified under the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), which serves as the peacekeeper of all of our far-flung settlements. But things aren't all hunky dory as there are some who want to rebel against its authority, and yep, you still have criminal pirates that raid ships. Some in the UNSC fear that eventually even bigger threats will emerge as humans move ever further from the centralized authority of Earth.  A secret program, called the Spartan-II project, is initiated to breed and train the ultimate super-soldier. If successful, the genetically and bionically enhanced Spartan-IIs will be much stronger, faster, and intelligent than a normal human and serve as the go-to black ops arm of the UNSC. Unfortunately, just as the Spartan-II soldiers complete some of their first missions, a new and unexpected threat arrives on the scene. We have our first alien contact with beings calling themselves "The Covenant". The Covenant has no interest in friendly relations. In fact, their priests have declared all humans an abomination to their god and instigate a holy war to wipe us out. The humans have plenty of ships and weapons to fight the Covenant, but they are mostly ineffective against the energy shields and laser and pulse weapons that the aliens possess. In effect, we are completely outgunned.  A desperate plan is launched to smuggle the Spartan-IIs, led by their commander, Master Chief, onto a Covenant ship and take the war to the Covenant homeworld. Before the mission can be carried out the Spartan-II homebase is invaded by the Covenant and they are all killed, except Master Chief, who is saved by the ship Pillar of Autumn. When the ship comes out of a blind jump into deep space, they encounter a huge ring-shaped artificial world called Halo...and a Covenant space fleet. It is said that the Covenant think that Halo is a powerful weapon and are attempting to figure out how to use it. The UNSC needs to find out if if this is true, but the Pillar suffers severe damage from the Covenant fleet. As the Pillar heads for a crash landing with Halo, Master Chief and the ship's AI, Cortana, enter an escape pod that will take them to the ring's surface.  I have to say I found myself a bit unimpressed by the Halo experience and found myself a bit bored in this first game. Is it just because it's almost a decade old or because it's just not as good as advertised? Probably a bit of both. First of all, I would have liked to have had more story in the game itself instead of having to read a prequel novel to get the full impact of the game. Because of its age, what cutscenes there are really show their age, polygonal and automaton movement glory to the max. From all of the other media that has come out since the game's release, I realize that universe of Halo is very rich and deep, but coming into this game, I get none of that. It just feels like playing any other pointless shooter.  A negative by-product of this game being an Xbox launch release is that the original Xbox became synonymous with First Person Shooters first, while the PS2 offered a more diverse game catalog. And really, I don't see how this game was so "evolved" over earlier FPSs like Doom or Quake. A lot of this had to do with the boring weaponry and enemies. You basically have about 4 types of each. The Spartan's main weapon MA5B assault Rifle was probably my least favorite gun in the game. In fact, spoiled as I am with COD, it felt like a noisy dart gun. I found myself gravitating to the sniper and shotgun most of the time or picking up Covenant plasma weapons over the human assault rifle. If you can't get anything right, at least make your protagonist's main weapon interesting. The levels themselves were quite lacking in imagination as well.  The vehicle controls, especially of the Warthog, the equivalent of a Humvee, were awful, and were especially cumbersome in the latter stages of the game.  One of my pet peeves about videogames is when they have a "fake save system". By that I mean they have an option that says "save and quit", but in actuality if you use it, it only takes you to your last saved checkpoint. What makes this fake is that your last saved checkpoint is where the game will automatically start you anyway. So the game makes you believe you are saving when in actuality you will lose all progress since the last checkpoint. I also felt that Halo suffered a bit because it didn't offer many checkpoints when it came to longer battles where you had a ton of enemies to take down. In fact, a lot of times, I just tried to rush past some of the battles instead of getting involved in them and dying and having to repeat myself. I actually found myself repeating out loud as I played "OMG, this is so frickin boring...so boring....so boring". This happened a lot when I had to repeat whole battles over and over. I finally got through them, or found a way to bypass them, but it was not an enjoyable experience.  Really, I guess in the end I could sum up my thoughts on Halo Combat Evolved as tedious. I did not have fun playing this game. It seemed more like work than a game. I never had a "wow" moment. The lack of story and the lack of variety in the environments, weapons, and enemies all served to make this game a major downer for me. I guess it's worth playing for its historical I didn't think it was a very good game. If you do choose to pick it up, definitely check out The Fall of Reach novel first to give it some context.	-1
Azurik's an interesting game. The elemental combination system that's at the heart of the game is an interesting one, and could have provided for some unique and creative puzzles, situations, and combat. However, in many respects, the game falls flat on its face. Combat, for one, as frequent as it is, is entirely uninteresting. A,A,A,B is the name of the game, and while you've got to make sure you're using the right elemental combinations, the lack of a reward for beating a monster (they respawn, you gain no experience, and often end up using more "elemental fuel" than you regain) is negligible. The game is billed as an action/adventure. Adventure games are generally about two things - seeing the sights, and solving some puzzles. The sights are a mix of good and bad. While there's clearly a lot of geometry up on the screen, it's not really put to good effect. Textures are detailed close up, but muddy from the distance you'd normally look at them from. Poor level-of-detail control. The level design is also often pointless, and very easy to get lost in due to the repetitive nature of the levels. Azurik's cardinal and unforgivable sin, however, is that there is no logic to the game. The puzzles are simply to find the pieces of the elemental discs, and their respective powers, and use them where you're told to. There are a few puzzles that actually require some thought, but even then, they're more illogical and trial-and-error based than not. Had there been any indication of where you might look to solve your current problem, the game would have been worlds better. Alas, the lack of logic in the puzzles and level designs, the poor floaty controls, the repetitive and boring combat, and the atrocious save system (yes, there's a save anywhere cheat. It can also permanently ruin your game, forcing you to start all over again if you use it wrong) make Azurik a pass for all but the most hardcore adventure gamers. But the problem, then, is that the hardcore have seen games much better than this.	-1
Halo is a much better game!  I started with Azurik, and it ws fun.  Then 20 minutes later I tried Halo, then MX2002, and 4 more games.  Azurik was way below my expectations.  This game is the least fun I have ever had.  Compared to other games, this is sooo dumb!  The storyline is just like Zelda, you gotta save some dumb planet from people.  The graphics are only good on the videos.  And I don't even want to START about the controls.  I reccomend renting this game, and spending your good $$$ on Halo.	-1
Yes the story of this game is somewhat compelling, but I have to agree with most other reviews on the web that this game certainly is lackluster.  I was expecting much more surrounding the hype of this game. The gameplay in this game could have been done much better.  You are subject to only a few attack moves, and the elemental powers do little to accentuate this.  I must say that the wings you get  were a throwback to the old Kid Icarus days though! A major drawback of this game is that the world of Azurik really isn't all that expansive--as the puzzles in the game aren't very difficult.  Also, with all the hype around the game surrounding this "massive" world to explore I found myself wanting more in the free-roaming capabilities and was severely disappointed.  Another drawback is the amount of back-tracking that needs to be done throughout the game.  A final drawback has is the graphics, had they spent another 3 months polishing them up, some of the areas they attempted to portray could have been gorgeous. I have to say that after finshing this game, I was quick to trade it in at Funcoland.	-1
Azurik is a pretty bad game. It very quickly becomes boring, has a very bad plot and the whole game is just.....kind-of stupid. (C'mon, you go around fighting polka-dotted lizards and looking for crystals as a blue guy who likes the adult version of Skeeter from the Cartoon Doug) Do not waste your time or money on this game. Before I played it I thought it was going to be a great game, I read previews and good reviews. I was very, very wrong. The only redeeming quality of this game is the graphics, it  might be fun for some people, (I heard it gets better later in the game, so I'll give it 2 stars instead of one)but I could barely play for 10 minutes. Ugh. Spend your money on great games like Halo, Dead Or Alive 3, Project Gotham Racing, NFL Fever 2002 etc. But you don't have to listen to me, rent it if you must and see for yourself. But remember, I warned you........	-1
Azurik reminds me a little of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter from years ago, except the premise is far less interesting and the main character is blue. Yep, blue. One of those ridiculous-looking Japanese Anime characters with tattoos and whacked-out hair. Worse, he appears to be made of a stiff plastic which makes him move with the realism of a Barbie doll. Seriously, he marches up steep hills without a single knee flex! The textures are nice, but the animation quality in Azurik is very poor by today's standards. Those of you who are saying this game really showcases the Xbox should try a few more games. The music is a poor attempt at a movie score, and the creatures you have to battle are as dumb as posts. The birds that fly around are animated so badly that I burst out laughing. But worst of all, the controls in Azurik are so lame that you have to spend half your time and energy just managing (centering) the camera so you can see what's going on. The bottom line? This is Microsoft's worst Xbox game, and if I were the product manager I would have pulled the plug. Stick with the likes of Halo, Munch's Odyssee, Project Gotham Racing, Cel Damage, and any EA Sports game for state-of-the-art fun.	-1
Such an overly overrated game like god of war. This is just another fantasy FPS that is nothing special (at least to me.) I'm not gonna write some long review on why it sucks. I'm just gonna recommend a much better substitute like doom for playstation -P.S. Get a life halo fanatics. Theres more to life than some stupid looking green astronaut shooting other stupid looking things	-1
Nearly seven years after the birth of the X-Box I found myself in line at a local video game retailer buying a used box for a fraction of the original cost when it was released.  I don't know what got into me, but I had to give this system a try.  I have been an off-again, on-again gamer ever since my father got me the original NES when I was in grade school for making all A's.  Over the years, cinema has become my new favorite hobby, but occasionally I crave for that ability to blow something up (the perfect de-stressor to the corporate world).  I must begin by saying that I am the college generation of "Goldeneye" for N64, so I place the bar pretty high when it comes to any FPS that teeter on the thought that they are "the best ever".  I remember when "Halo" was released, causing a rift in the gaming world.  People couldn't seem to get enough of this game, addictions ran high, and Halloween costumes of Master Chief seemed to be popular.  That was back in 2001.  It is currently 2006 and last night (after two months of random playtime), I beat this game - and let me be the first to say this (although I am not) - I was not impressed.  "Halo" begins flawlessly.  With big guns ablazn' you play as Master Chief, a dutiful soldier that is taken out of hibernation to do what the rest of the military cannot, stop the Covenant.  Similar to "Goldeneye", you have the unique ability to pick up weapons, use the terrain as your shield, and literally, blow everything up.  The excitement of this game comes when you realize that you have the mighty grenade in one hand, with a choice of two weapons in the other.  The weapons are creative, but nothing spectacular, and as the game develops further, it adds to the painful repetition due to the fact that as you progress, no new weapons become available.  Thirty minutes into the game, you can pretty much count the weapons you will get to use in one hand.  "Halo" attempt to keep the player's attention by changing scenery as much as possible, giving the Covenant some impressive A.I. ability, as well as slowly introduce a better arsenal of weapons used solely for the enemy.  This game at times reminded me of the television show "G.I. Joe" because while Cobra definitely had the best weapons, the Joe's would always be victorious - I could never quite see the math behind that.  Quickly, I would like to apologize about my constant critique of the weapons of the game, but for me, a person that wants to be able to pick up anything and constantly want to upgrade the arsenal, the weapons seemed cheap and dull.  I think even Master Chief was getting bored with the lacking arrangement of weapons...  Just when a level of comfort settled in, the developers decide to throw some new enemies in which does allow for some hectic moments mainly because these new enemies, the FLOOD, fight anything that moves - even Covenant.  This means that grenades are flying everywhere, or you can be like me and duck for cover and watch the destruction happen from the comfort of a corner.  Just like with the weapons, you have the ability to ride in vehicles for both good and evil.  Let me be the first to say, I hated the Warthog.  Who could control this beast?  I was surprised I was even able to get to the ship at the end of the game, because I was cursing the engineers that developed this vehicle.  Apparently, you needed a special driver's license to operate this machinery and my Master Chief could not properly study.  I couldn't control it, and it caused me to further lessen my enjoyment of this game.  Yet, and I don't mean to point fingers, but the Covenant's choice of vehicles were easy to use, well equipped with weaponry, and fun.  Why couldn't our team's stuff be more like that (yet again eluding to my Cobra reference from above)?  Slowly, the annoyance factor because to erupt...  "Halo" did have one plus to its name, and that was the controls.  Outside of driving the Warthog, I felt that the controls were relatively easy to learn and use.  By the end of the first mission, I thought that I could easily evade any baddies along the trip.  But, no matter how easy the controls were, where "Halo" suffered the most was in the development of the story and scenery.  This game was exciting for the first two-three missions, but after that, we just fell quickly into the world of repetition.  The background felt like it remained the same, the evil-doers jumped out of the most normal of places, and eventually I got to the point where I just wanted to finish the game because I was getting bored.  "Halo", the game that defined the X-Box, literally bored me.  My fingers were getting numb, the story was stale, and my eyes were bored.  If I could use one sentence to summarize my "Halo" experience, it would be the previous one.  I expected more because of the hype surrounding this game, but I never got it.  Visually, it started out well, but eventually it just became old ... very very quickly.  Overall, I think everyone should give "Halo" at least one shot.  I didn't go too deeply into the multi-player aspects or the team play because honestly, I play games for the story and adventure.  "Halo", for me, needs to get better for me to enjoy the entire series.  I am looking for a stronger story in "Halo 2", as well as more captivating bad guys, a stronger score (for those that speak highly of this ... watch Akira, you can find the same music there), and more weapons.  If I can get one request across it is to loose the Warthog, the worst vehicle ever developed.  I am on the fence.  I thought it was good, but not the greatest FPS ever created.  I will still put "Goldeneye" on the top of the list as being the forerunner in this category.  Oh, I nearly forgot, what also annoyed me about "Halo" was the ending.  I thought it was rather cheap for the amount of time that I put into the game.  I want strong, money spending development from beginning to end.  "Halo" pulled some cheap shots, and now, six years later ... it feels dated.  Grade: **1/2 out of *****	-1
This game is stupid theres no point or story to the game all you do is go around shooting alians and watching them blow up. Kids say the game rules when they havn't even played it. One question why is the game rated M and got best game of 2003 if it's so babyish? If you like this game your a big stupid idoit who likes chickens! THIS GAME SUCKS PLAY SONIC INSTED!	-1
This isn't a game...it's an evil entity from you-know-where....it's come to take over the human race...and it's succeeding...it almost got me. I rented it, then realized within minutes that I was playing a clump of manure, not a "superb and divine game experience". I truly believed that RPGs saved me...if you find your psyche being taken over by this evil, feverish disease known as "Halo", quickly play FFVII or Chrono Cross. It's the only cure. And now, the evil entity has devised a way to clone itself. That's right, Halo 2 is upon us, and the foolish public still hasn't wised up. Run while you still can, dear reader. You may think you're too clever to be tricked by evil, but this is such a twisted machination that it even made Game Informer its mindless puppet. If you must have an FPS, buy Metroid Prime...Nintendo is the only savior from the demon-spawn that is Halo.	-1
This game is okay but were is season, who the hells haku wheres blood?! nothing good about this game u cant climb ladders and it almost imposibble to win titles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! u cant save ethier this game blows	-1
I knew this game wasn't very deep when I bought it used for 10 bucks. But even so I was SHOCKED by the limits of this game. The roster of wrestlers is nothing to write home about and there simply isn't alot of moves you can do. The lack of matches is also a big negitive. I got to say that I have not played a good wrestling game since WWF NO Mercy on the Nintendo 64. Seems as though wrestling games died after that. Another thing is that the fun seems to be lacking. You don't have much freedom due to the crowd factor(this should be an option and not a unchangeable rule)and it makes me feel tight as a gamer and you really can't afford to play around with the oppnent at all. Just no fun here at all. Gave it to a fews son. What a poor soul he is.	-1
To make it short this was a terrible game this was one of the reasons I got an XBOX but this was just plain dissapointing and the matches are very outdated especially for the time this game came out!  It's just...terrible..The visuals were pretty good but that's pretty much it...The rest it all falls down...  Don't get this game, if you want a good Wrestling game get WWE SMACKDOWN Here comes the Pain for PS2.  Other then that...  1 out of 5 stars...  Lates	-1
This game pretty much has the best definition of sucks. The entrance videos you can watch is cool in the history section or whatever you call it.  But the game is pretty much bad Pros Good graphics You can watch there full music videos in the history biagraphy thing....and thats pretty much it Cons very slow paced gets boring after 4 minutes no season mode no street fight NO HELL IN THE CELL FOR CRYING OUT LOUD THERES NOT EVEN A FRIGGIN CAGE MATCH HERE.  Even the original raw for psx had more crap than this... No Divas I think... Graphics can get fuzzy AND MORE! DONT GET THIS GAME TRUST ME!!!!  GO With smackdown shut your mouth and here comes the pain.....This game sucks	-1
WWF Raw is a very interesting game. One downside is that the Trishdog(Stratisfaction) is a back special yet Trish doesn't do it. Her back special is the Low Blow. With the Front and back moves to get strong grapples, you have to make your opponent groggy, like in SD!3:JBI. For front and back specials you have to have a glowing Spirit meter and you must make your opponent groggy. Outside the ring in Hardcore matches 10 WWF equipment cases with an item inside. There are a lot of hats for items including a miner's helmet,cheff hat,sombreroa few baseball caps and 2 Japanese hats. Some of the items are just rediculous like fruit,coat hangers,slippers,stuffed animals,a picture frame ; the list goes on and on. There is only one apperance for CAWs. Which can make it easier for some poeple. The game play takes some time to get used to. There is an interference rule for entrances which for those impatiant ones and those who like to maim opponents it is a good way to start the match. Christain's "At last" is on there, but not Edge's "Never Gonna Stop". They also have some old entrance themes. SCSA's entrance is the Aliance version. In CAS, you can set lights and pyros for their entrance. The game can be cool at times and rediculous at other times.	-1
I Gave This Game 2 Stars Because Of Good Graphics and Good Entrances That's It. I Don't Know About anybody Else But For Me What Matters Is Gameplay, and This Game Does Not Have Quality Gameplay. I Strongly Dislike The Fact That You Have to Get The Crowd to Cheer For you, So That you'll Be Able Do Your Special Move. As One Reviewer Said if you Hit your Opponent With A Chair So Many Times They'll Begin to Cheer For Them! What Baffles Me Is Why You Unlock Clothing, For Creating a Wrestler is One Thing But Using It For A Weapon Is Positively Ridicoulus! (Example Beating Someone Up With a Bandana Or Sunglasses) Here are Some Other Things In The Game That Annoy Me: 1. You Can't Put People or your Created Wrestlers In Stables 2. You Can't Have your Manager Come Out with you 3. Not A Wide Selections Of Moves, Taunts, and Entrances Final Analysis: Do Not Buy This Game, No Matter How Much your Craving a WWF Game!	-1
A few words before i begin my review. Ignore my others for this game. These are the true facts. First of all the wrestlers. The faces look like bugs bunnys expression after he has the gun in his face in the hands of elma faud. Second of all, the lack of wrestlers. Now i'm not going to sit here all day naming the missing wrestlers but i can name two of the basic ones missing. Hulk Hogan. Booker T. THird of all, you cant climb ladders. What? You cant climb them but you can knock em out with them Same with the tables. Fourth of all, hers an example. I was the undertaker and kane against spike dudley and jeff hardy. I performed two chokeslams in a row followed by a wild ride or whatever his finisher his and the wrestler, (sha zam) popped right back up in a 4ourth of a second. My advice, if you 100% want this game rent it, any lower don't even waste 5 bucks. I am a huuuuuge wrestling fan and have played all the others and loved them but this was a dissssssssssssaaaaapppppooooooiiiiiiittttttmmmmmeeeeennnnnttt.	-1
I keep re-writing my reviews for this game becuase if I can prevent one reader from wasting his time and money on this piece of garbage like I did, I'll find slightly vindicated.  People have driven this games low-points into the ground on other reviews, so I'll concentrate on the few high points.  1.  The graphics are OK. And that's it!  The gameplay on this garbage is so bad, I can't believe it was released to the public.  THQ must have gotten tired of releasing high quality wrestling games from the development team at AKI (Wrestlemania 2000, WWF No Mercy), so they let the development team at Anchor take a stab at making the worst wrestling game ever.  If that was the goal, congratulations, you suceeded.	-1
Halo Combat Evolved is the most overhyped game I've ever encountered. I've heard for years how great this game is so I finally bought it on sale for $15, even that was too much.  I am a veteran PC player of first person shooters who started with the original Wolfenstein 3D and have played almost everything since including all the Dooms, Quakes, Jedi Knight, Half-life and Unreal Tournament. There is nothing in Halo that hasn't been done before! In fact it's the easiest most linear FPS I've ever played. I finished the single player game in a little more then two days.  There are only 10 levels in the game, each of which is broken down into 3 to 4 sub chapters. The game play lacks any puzzle elements, switch hunts or boss battles so all you do is move down a path shooting everything that moves, which is fun for about 5 min then it gets old. you are outfitted with a motion sensor, right out of the movie Aliens, so it's no mystery where the bad guys are. There are a few times in the game where you are required to locate specific areas but that is aided by your onboard computer assistant who kindly gives you nav points to locate them, so you just follow the dots leaving piles of bodies in your wake.  As other reviewers have noted you can drive vehicles but the human vehicles take no damage at all and you can't get one of the other marines to drive the vehicle if you want to take the gunners position so you are left to driving, but then you can't shoot from the drivers position. This leaves you stopping and dismounting everytime you want to engage the enemy. Alien vehicles are one man vehicles so you can shoot as well as drive and they do take damage.  Most FPS games let your character carry far too many weapons. Halo has the opposite extreme. Your character is limited to carrying two weapons and granades so the majority of your post combat time is spent looking through the piles of bodies for the best two weapons you can find. All the standard FPS guns are here the pistol, machine gun, sniper rifle, alien plasma rifle, needler [direct half-life rip off], shot gun and of course the rocket launcher.  Enemy AI is also vastly over hyped. Its obvious after a few minutes they run a standard pattern that is easily overcome with a quick trigger finger and a strafe.  Halo's graphics are very pretty and the frame rate is smooth throughout the game but combined with the unispired story and game play and linear design it not a big a plus.  Multiplayer play is limited to the usual styles but lacks any online capability at all. To use it you have to all be local then you can share the console or connect several together.  If you're a veteran FPS player Halo is likely to disappoint. If you're a newbie to FPS's then you will get some enjoyment from this game till you discover the vastly superior PC FPS games, which you have been able to play online or over a network with your friends since the mid 90's!	-1
I own a lot of xbox games. This def. is the worst one! I guess some of the things in the game are considered cool by the younger crowd. However, if you are an older player (like myself... I'm in my twenties...), you def. won't like this one. I was NOT impressed by the graphics. As a software developer, I have to say that the xbox can do MUCH better. While you can recognize your characters, they certainly aren't life-like. But worst of all is the gameplay. In a tag-team match, my two opponents actually started to fight each other and one tried to actually pin the other! What a farce. When you hit people (there are way to few moves, btw...) and knock them to the ground, their bodies mysteriously slide around on their backs. I was hoping for a wrestling game that would rival games such as Dead or Alive 3. But this is a serious disappointment!	-1
Graphics look nice but are severly flawed when it comes down to realistic modeling! Grapple engine shows promise, but the overall gameplay stinks big time! More than half the hype never materialized into the final product. Put it like this... I share the same sentiments and gripes that most the reviewers who have criticized this game have! I was really looking forward to this title, but I feel personally that graphics aside... It's garbage! By all means, if you must check out this title, RENT IT FIRST! And YES I'm a huge wrestling game fan!	-1
Hype A lot of it Hype It didn't live up to it........not even close FACTS : Wage war with top WWF Superstars modeled in amazing detail The look and detail are ok, but wrestlers knees do not bend. LOL really. But games are not looks alone. Assault opponents before you get to the ring Ya click the Y button and the game takes over, not really that big of a deal. Watch the audience scatter as the action spills into the crowd Not in this game, it was left out, and the "audience" is still very dull to see and have that "cardboard" cut out look. Battle in more than 10 backstage areas Nope again, Not in this game. Something else that is promoted but not true. Look as a adult, I play games for fun, but to promote them on my websites or to other adult friends. This game has nothing to offer. There are only a few modes, the game it's self is overly hard ( took me 4 hours to win a match on easy mode because no matter what you do the computer/Xbox kicks out most of the time ) If your going to buy this for a child, make sure the kid does not get bored fast, and if your buying this for yourself, RENT IT FIRST ! 2 Stars 1. The creat-a-player is very good. 2. The over all "look" to the games is very well put together. THIS IS A RENT FIRST BUY LATER GAME !	-1
I'm really glad I rented this game first.  Graphically, it's stunning, starting with the perfectly recreated Raw open at the beginning.  But graphics can only take you so far.  There also are a ton of available wrestlers in this game, but most of them fall into the "he's still around?" category. The problems start right at the main menu.  There are only the most basic matches, like one on one, tag team, triple threat, and a six-man tag match.  You can make the matches hardcore, but that's about the extent of what you can do in this game.  No ladder matches, no steel cage or hell in a cell matches, no options.  You can't even fight into the backstage area or crowd in a hardcore match.  There is also no career mode, meaning no alliances built and no real direction for you to go.  Instead, the game allows you to go after the individual belts, which require you to beat a certain number of superstars.  After you win the belt, that's it.  And you can't save your progress either, so be prepared to spend a solid hour and a half at least going for a belt. I also have issues with the gameplay.  It's a simple enough system and pretty easy to use, but there are a few quirks.  The stamina meter is a great idea that's been very poorly done.  Four punches and you're out of breath, opening you up to all sorts of attacks.  I thought these were WWF superstars, not Homer Simpson.  The computer also gives wrestlers like X-Pac the ability to reverse everything, including punches and kicks, and never let you get anything going.  That can be a good or a bad thing, depending on how much of a challenge you want.  But the most annoying thing has to be the crowd meter, which allows you to do your finishing move when it starts flashing.  In order to get this, you have to vary your moves, which I don't have a problem with.  What I do have a problem with is that the crowd turns on you bigtime if you use the same moves repeatedly.  For example, you can inadvertently let your opponent do their special move if you throw one too many punches. The Create-A-Wrestler system is good, but I've seen better.  The developers also see some reason to only allow you to create 16 wrestlers.  Also, if you expect to create a true superstar, that won't happen.  You can't build your stats up enough. Overall, this is an ok game that could have been much better if more time was spent on it and the developer didn't rush it out.  It's worth a rent, but just barely.	-1
i really don't know what i can say about this game that is good. i waited so long for this to be released and them finally it comes out and there is no season mode  there is a lack of a good roster  characters like k-kwik and Haku are included but no RVD or BookerT or DDP no Alliance members at all except for those in the wwf prior to the invasion. the characters walk bowlegged like they just got released from a prison or something. come on this is microsoft cant you come up with something a little better even Smackdown just Bring it is ten times better than this and create a wrestler especialy [stinks] on this game  this game took long enoughto get out on the market  so why not pull it off the shelf and take a little more time and give us a game that is actually worth the wait and the money i feel ripped off and i just rented it for 4 bucks so i wonder how someone who buys it is going to feel. don't get me wrong i am a huge wrestling fan i have even been to a recent Pay per view  (no Mercy and it was awsome) so im not disliking this game cause its a wresling game i dislike it cause they spent way too long on it for it to turn out the way it did. hope this helps some of you out there	-1
What is the big deal about Halo. It is one of the worst and stupidest games I have ever played. I think people like it because all you do is kill aliens that are extreamly stupid. In one mission you can kill like 100 alien things and you die 4 times. The aliens even speak english. How would a thing billions of miles away from earth know how to speak english. I think that is just stupid. Theres only like 10 weapons and 4 things you can ride in in the game.  In the game the warthog and earth cars can never break or explode but the alien stuff can. Another stupid thing is the missions are way too long. It takes abouut 1 hour to finish a mission. And once you die you come back to life. So anyone can beat the game. Some aleins have invisible shields on them and you have to waste a lot of ammo on them. All you can carry is two guns and grenades. And since theres only like 10 weapons you allways pick up the same gun. Theres only about 8 differnent kinds of aliens and they are all stupid. Hunters are big alien things that are almost impossible to kill, little stupid aliens that speak english and run away from you, little aliens with shields, big aliens that have invisible shields around them and they chase you, Floods that when you kill them little ball thing with no guns come out and jump and pop on you, theres more but they are mainly the same as the ones I just wrote but they are different colors or are bigger or smaller. If you like combat games don't buy this because all you do is kill dumb aleins. It is not hard at all. Dont buy it.	-1
This game just plainly sucks. Whoever plays this game needs to find something else to do even if its to go down to the local park and pick up trash, thats how bad this game is. This game's realism is as low as anyone who plays it. The game itself lacks in every aspect of orginal concept. Everything from the weapons to stages, even the monsters are rub-offs from other shooters and cheap sci-fi flicks. This game has no realism again the concept is terrible and nothing is original. I am glad this game is only on x-box so the other systems wouldn't have to bare its embarassment. Whoever plays this game should second guess their actions and remember what their looking at. A cheaply put together game with annoying sci-fi gadgets and the most annoying looking costumes ever. If I were you I would settle with Doom 1 or even Wolfenstien. Don't bother buying this game if you do you'll be disappointed and embarassed. Make sure your friends don't see it ;)	-1
There's no excuse for a half baked, beta test like this to be released on the market. Anchor should be ashamed of themselves and Microsoft should be downright embarrassed. It's things like this that validate all the Xbox bashing that's been going on. The charges of it being an eye candy machine and nothing more stand true on games like this.  Let me say here and now that Smackdown 3 still stands well unchallenged as the best wrestling game of the newer generation thus far. I think GC's Wrestlemania game has great potential.  This had outstanding potential and I was well pleased when this got delayed by four months. Why? Because I thought a lot of extra work was going into it. Now I shudder in fear to think of what this would have been like had it been released on its original December date.  The Pros: Gorgeous looking and sounding, like any Xbox game. Cons: Gameplay mechanics are slow and cumbersome at times. Player model and movements are downright bewildering. Near zero options and replay value. You can't even go for the tag titles! No story mode! No steel cage, no Royal Rumble...no nothing! The roster is filled mostly with jokes. 35 wrestlers sounds impressive until you realize it's filled mostly with names like K-kwik and Haku!! There's no excuse for not having the updated, post-Invasion roster ready to go. I am angry enough about this that I am starting to make plans to unload my Xbox. I have one game for it: Halo. I don't see anything coming anytime soon that looks promising. Everything else has been empty eye candy. This is a crime and they should pull it off the shelves and issue an apology. They should also rework, top to bottom and in about six months give us the finished product. Smackdown 3 looks like a masterpiece next to this. I am ashamed to own an Xbox as of now.	-1
WWF RAW is a perfect example of great packaging to mask a HORRIBLE GAME!!!!! This has to be the BIGGEST disappointment I have personally EVER had as a video game player/owner.  I had such monumental high hopes for it and it fell flat on EVERY level. Let's take a look and see how THQ dropped the ball... #1 - Possibly the worst Create-A-Wrestler ever!  Costumes, colors, faces, masks, are extremely limited (or else so goofy you'd never want to use them).  Games for the PSX and N64 completely dominate the pitful options here.  Forget trying to make any ECW, WCW, or super-hero characters!  You're limited to three skin colors and only 9 color options for clothing (no text additions on shirts either). #2 - Limited match options!  NO CAGE MATCH!  NO ROYAL RUMBLE!  NO SURVIVOR SERIES!  NO BLOOD!  NO LUMBERJACK!  Come on!!!!  Games like Warzone and Attitude for the PSX even had these options!  And correct me if I'm wrong, weren't some of these options supposedly offered when the game was being previewed? #3 - Confusing game play!  Although the moves and fighting style are nice, the camera angle shifts WAY too often to allow you to stay focused. #4 - Music and Save options!  Compare this game to the other Xbox offerings like Gotham City Racing (for the music) or Halo (for save and game options) and you'll be crying in your soup.  On a hard drive the size of the Xbox this game actually limits you in saving CAW and match options!  LIMITS the size of 16 wrestlers!  PHAW! I could go on and on about why I think this game is a titanic waste of time, money, and expectations but I won't.  THQ needs to take a good look at classic wrestling games like the PSX's WWF Attitude or N64's Wrestlemania 2000 because with their newest offering they have taken wrestling games back...A HUGE STEP!	-1
After waiting months for this title to ship, I have to say I'm disappointed, no real career mode, and they've gone too far away from the N64 style of control. The camera angle is also horrible, and can not be adjusted. I don't see why many changes would be made to the No Mercy for N64 control style. Dozens of moves at your fingertips with no problem. If its not broken don't fix it. The roster is also outdated, although i know there isn't much that can be done about that. Did I mention the camera angle sucks, good, cause it's really bad. Oh yeah, and the controls. No good. Maybe I need to get used to it, but I may not be playing it often enough to get used to it. If i wanted 6 moves at my disposal I'd play the Smackdown... on PS2	-1
After months of hype, the game was finally released far lower than expectations. There is no story mode (Road to Wrestlemania), instead there are championship modes where you need to go through 12 wrestlers to get a title shot. The Raw arena is the ONLY arena and there are no backstage areas. Nor is there any real hardcore action, because even though there are 1000s of weapons, these weapons are helmets, tutus, jack-o-lanterns, chairs, bandanas and so on. The wrestlers do not bleed at all, not even with a code! There is a pretty deep create-a-wrestler feature, however you can only create 16 wrestlers! So you have to go out and buy memory cards to hold 16 more wrestlers (rip-off). There is no RVD, DDP, Booker T and so on, however there is Rhyno, Spike and Haku. There are very few modes, exhibition and the king of the ring tournament. There are no table matches, ironman matches, or 6 man tag matches (even though the game lets 6 wrestlers in the ring at the same time). All of the titles are not even in the game! The only belts are the World, Intercontinental, European, Light-Heavyweight and the Women's title. The play is very unbalanced, such as the Rock and the Undertaker can undoubtedly beat up K-Kwik and X-Pac, so there is no chance raising a new star! Another detail to the game is the new stamina bar, where your wrestler will get "winded" the more he runs and does power moves. So Rhyno cannot do gore after gore, because he would get tired. With there being a stamina bar, there is also a "voltage" bar, which is basically one long bar that determines who is winning and when you can do finishing maneuvers. The controls are unique, where you have an attack, grapple, block and action button. The attack button is capable of several attacks, such as hold up and press the attack button will do a dropkick, hold down and press the attack it will be a kick or a punch. It's the same with the grapple button. The action button can do anything from perform a taunt, pin an opponent, pick up weapons, put on clothes and climb the turnbuckle. The graphics and sound are amazing, but what fun is the game if there are no modes to keep you interested in?	-1
The only way I ever suggest you to buy this game is if you've never played the one on Dreamcast, N64, or the Playstation.  Sure, it's probably the most complete version of the game, but it's a sleeper hit in my opinion.  If Tony Hawk 3 weren't coming out for the system, I'd suggest you get it, but since it is, I suggest you rent before a purchase.	-1
This game has it's ups and downs. The plot in this game is fairly original. It takes bits from different stories, and it becomes something new. And, I love the comedy in this game. For example, there is a rivalry between two of the characters for control of Ari, which is amusing. There is also flirting, which you take part in if you choose. And some of the characters are fairly interesting. But, the dungeons are terrible. They're repetitive, you just beat urns and things a lot of the time to move on. Plus, you're under attack constantly outside of cities. And since the combat is boring, it's an excruciating experience overall. But the cut scenes are fun and you get to choose what to say many times throughout the game. I think the plot being revealed is worth the torture the rest of the time. You should probably rent Okage and check it out before buying it.	-1
If you have played good shooting games this is not for you.  With limited weapons and vehicles as well as tiny multiplayer maps this game is ok but nothing makes in stand out.  You would be just as happy with any other new shooting game.  There really is no strategy what so ever it is straight forward shooting.  I would reccomend buying one of the battlefield games or planetside for experienced gamers.	-1
I Ordered this game,Promp Delivery!(2-3 Days).Then I opend it & put it in. Low a Behold it was a "Blue Back" aka Cd-Rom. My PS2 Never plays "Blue Backs",along with Hundreds if not thousands of other Folks!,(check the Web!).DVD Format Work Great!,any and all Silver backs are Fine!.Problem is You never know 'till it's opend!.Most Places won't take them back!,Or will let you exachange it for another!(Like,What good does that Do?).  With all that Said,I never Played it! ;-(	-1
You shouldn't have to be patient and wait for a game to get better. The playstation2 to this point is the most awful RPG system I have ever played. I miss the playstation already. This game is acceptable has a "cute" story but not an epic by any means, good rpg for newbies and kids.	-1
Like the review below no season mode, only a few game matches. The graphics will be the best in the buisness. Thats all the XBOX has. This game has no sence of getting but what it has is......nothing. If you want a game that has ove 75 match types, 45 wrestlers, good graphics not GREAT, 8 venues to fight in, many backstage areas, GET SMACKDOWN 3 for the PS2. ONE MORE thing, you all might remember Raw Is War for the N64, it had better than the original Smackdown, BUT the plyers moved slow like in this game (Raw Is War). If you like graphics fet this game, but if you like games get another wrestling game.	-1
There's really nothing special here--the music is irritating, the graphics are on par with Roly Poly Ollie (only not as inspired or amusing), the battle gameplay is not intuitive, there are no voices for the characters (only occasional narration), and the humor is abysmal (I sense they were going for a Pee-Wee's Playhouse/Rocky & Bullwinkle approach, but it just doesn't come off.) I don't mind having to go through some prep work before my first battle, but 45+ minutes is ridiculous--particularly if you're not given the opportunity to save before your first fight.  Yup, killed in the 3rd battle, never saw anything that would let the game be saved.  (This might something that was overlooked, but, well, it shouldn't be possible to overlook SAVING YOUR GAME, should it?) I understand that a part of the plot is that the main character (Ari is his default name) blends into people's shadows, but the way he interacts with the other characters in the set-up is ridiculous:  things he says are frequently ignored by other characters, and at one point your reply options are "Yes," "Yes," and "Yes."  Why give me the illusion of control over my character if you're not going to respect the choices I make? Overall, very disappointing to me:  it seemed like it had potential, but, honestly, after dying over an hour into the game without ever being given a clear option to save, I had no desire to go through the bad jokes again.	-1
I used to like this game alot. Now that I don't like it anymore, I find it quite unusual how people worship it. There was alot of hype over this game when it came out, and it's probably the only reason why Xbox sales were doing so well back then. I've pretty much gone back to playing PC games and my Xbox has been collecting alot of dust lately. Actually, the reason why I hate this game now is because of my friends. They used to make fun of Halo, then somehow, the demonic entity known as Halo took over their minds, their bodies, and their souls. We played everyday. They took it way too seriously and I can't stand playing Halo with them anymore. I began to notice some bad things about Halo: -Everything about the game is way too childish. You play an invincible godlike character who just can't die thanks to his recharging shield and the powerups laying all over the place. The aliens are wimpy and cheesy. Plus there's an alien race that rips off John Carpentar's The Thing!!!!!!! -Most of the game levels look the same! There were some variety, but not enough. -Weapon names are too obvious. Quotes from people playing: "Oh, I'm really good with the SNIPER RIFLE!" "SHOTGUNS are good when you want to fight somebody up close!" "You use the PISTOL way too much!" -Vehicles were invincible. At least, the warthog and the tank was. How come most of the alien vehicles could be destroyed? There's alot of other things I could say about Halo. I believe there was too much hype when the game was just like any other first person shooter. What really destroyed Halo was when it was released for Xbox instead of for PC like it was intended too so it could boost Xbox sales. The game probably never even reached it's full potential thanks to the Xbox. The game doesn't even looked finished. The plot has way too much hope in it. Even though the human race is being annihilated by an alien race known as the Covenant, everything is hopeful because of the god you play as. At least with Half-Life, there was almost no hope because there was aliens as well as soldiers trying to kill you. Halo could have been a great game, but Xbox ruined it. PC version is not any better either.	-1
I usually don't write online reviews, but Halo warrents one. It's just another game. I wasn't impressed. The levels are highly repetitive and get boring quickly. I never finished this one, not because of the diffuculty, but because it gets old rather quickly. After a while all they do is throw enemies at you. I don't know how Halo got this big of a buzz. Honestly. Metroid Prime was a lot better. If you want to compare it to other FPS, Medal of Honor blows it away in every way. Including Multiplayer. I guess people believe what they are told. I'll be looking for Halo 2 to actually be good and live up to some of the overhype of the first one.	-1
Xbox may have great titles like Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding, Blood Wake, Dead or Alive 3 (my favorite), Genma Onimusha, and Halo, but one question...do we really need another Tony Hawk 2 ? I mean, come on now, this game is about 3 years old. I know what you guys are thinking..."why couldn't Craig give this a better rating ?". Why ? Because this is just an upgraded version of the same skating game that released 3 years ago. But let me give the lowdown on the game. The graphics are improved ! There are a hell of a lot of changes made for the Xbox version and the skaters look great, especially when they do shadowlike movements when their "Special meter" turns yellow, and the stages are bigger than ever. There are some new ones and old ones from Tony Hawk 1, but nothing really special. Most of the characters look almost the same. The only slight change is the detail and the framerate. The sound is still the same. The same grinding sounds from rails and cement. And especially, the same old soundtrack ! I just got tired of it now ! The only additional song is the one from the new skatepark on England. It sounds like an instrumental of DDR's "Paranoia". But once again...nothing special. The gameplay is still the same. The controls are still the same way it was from the PlayStation, N64, and Dreamcast versions. The only new element, is the multiplayer, where players can go at it with four controllers ! Wow...was that supposed to amaze me ? Anyway, this game is only for the people who never tried the Tony Hawk series or people who never even bothered to play the Tony Hawk series. But don't get me wrong. It's not like I have anything against THPS2X. I like how the game is done, but I'm just saying, I already played it on the Dreamcast and PlayStation. There is really no need to port it over to a powerful machine like Xbox (I still like Gamecube, Dreamcast, and PlayStation 2 better). If you never tried out the game, now's your chance ! Go ahead and get this game if you own Xbox. But if you already played it, just forget about it, and keep putting your focuses on the now and current Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, if you have a Gamecube, PS2, or Game Boy Advance. All in all an average game for the Xbox, but this game is 3 years old, and it's really pointless if an old game is played on one of the latest systems out there. Maybe Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2X shouldn't have been made in the first place. HERE'S A THOUGHT...TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER 3 IS ALREADY OUT ON THE XBOX, SO GO GET THAT ONE INSTEAD ! IT LOOKS BETTER AND MOST OF ALL, IT PLAYS BETTER. THE XBOX VERSION HAS ONE ADDITIONAL SKATER AND ONE ADDITIONAL STAGE. TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER 2X IS ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE EARLIER VERSIONS, SO STAY AWAY, IF YOU'RE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH IT !	-1
This pad is extremley uncomfortalbe. The analog sticks have too much give, the main 4 buttons are too close together and shaped strangley. I MUCH prefer the controller S.  Which makes up for everything that is wrong with this pad.	-1
The original Xbox controller was large, awkward & cumbersome.  The poor ergonomic design and the hard to reach positioning of its buttons made the original controller incredibly hard to get used to.  Fortunately, there is an alternative - the Xbox type S controller, which I have found to be one of the most comfortable and easy to use gamepads out on the market.	-1
this controller [stinks] big time. the buttons are small and poorly located, after 15 minutes your hands get sweaty and sore.	-1
This thing is a monster.  The controls are awkward and it doesn't feel right.  I bought the other controller which is smaller and the buttons are placed better.  I try not to use this big monster controller.  It makes playing games difficult.	-1
The Xbox' controller is a horrible controller.  There are many reasons why it is this bad.  The #1 reason why this is bad is because it is so dang chunky.  For those with little hands this controller is absolutely out of the question.  You need a map to find all the buttons(obviously just kidding).  The controller is the source of your gameplaying skills and being chunky, well beng chunky aint good.  Another reason of the teribbelness9is that a word?0 is the shape and placement of the buttons.  i mean comeon oval?  The buttons are also stuck on the tippy top of the controller which(again) means that this will be tough for the little handed ones.  This is the pain lovers best friend because you're going to be experiencing just that.  This pad is also well extrmely ugly.  [$$$] for this mess...Come on?   Sure the Xbox has some good games but come on we don't need pain just to play a game.  We have enough pain in real life.  Atleast Microsoft of japan has a smaller controller...	-1
that stupid contorller is soo big, it won't fit anywhere.  trust me like my review on the system, you don't want it.  stick with computers microsoft.	-1
To begin, this controller is HUGE. Its WAY to big for me or any of my friends. The stupid XBOX symbol in the middle takes half of the space away, and thats why the buttons are too close to eachother. Also, ur right thumb kills when u try to reach for that d-pad at the bottom. Microsoft did a terrible job. You should get a controll S.	-1
This controller feels like you are holding a big rock. There is no comfort in it! The buttons are also hard to reach if you have small hands-no, scrub that, if your hands aren't the size of a regular pumpkin.	-1
It's too big, The button layout [stinks], and it looks really stupid.  Better luck next time Micro$oft.	-1
I don't think antone knows what the hell they're talking about. Halo is by far NOT the best shooter ever. It can be just as easily matched with Duke Nukem 64 for N64. Look, i have a gamecube, and if you want a real shooter, send your piece of crap X-BOX to hell and get a gamecube. X BOX sux X COX!!!! The only reason it even gets a 1 outa 5 is because it's a game!	-1
(...) this horrible controller would I think stop most people from getting Xbox, it's very fat and hard to find the right buttons, the d-pad feels like hard lumpy potatoes and is hard for non-veterans to use. Just all the buttons feel like they're in the wrong spot. It could of worked if it wasn't so weird.	-1
NOT FOR XBOX 360! This product is not for the 360 and it would have cost me more to ship it back than it cost. I was very disappointing and I have no use for this. I probably will give it to Gamestop or Goodwill. Waste of money. I specifically searched for Xbox 360 receiver and this came up first. This is not for the xbox 360.	-1
this is not i nice controller for a few reasons, the first is the buttons areclose together! you do`t want to hit the wrong key when you are play a fast paced game! the second and last reason is it doesn`t fell to great in your hand! get the mad catz controller like i did for ($)it feels great and the buttons are spaced farther apart to a good distance and they arn`t too far scaped ither.	-1
Believe me NHL 2K2 And NHL 2002 totally waste NHL Hitz which is so unrealistic. The only good things about this game is the play-by-play announcing, the graphics and the great, easy controls. HItz is just terrible form there. The gameplay is not the NHL! If you have played NBA Shwotime you know what I mean. This game is 3-3  "NHL" hockey with terrible gameplay. The computer is so easy to get around, they barely check you, but it is impossible to score. Then on the other end the computer scores right away. I gave up 3 goals in a mater of 1 minute. Also just like in Midway's other games when you shoot the puck smoke comes out of it. It is very unrealistic. I still find this game pretty fun though. If you own an X-Box don't waste 50 bucks ont his game and get EA's NHL 2002. I thought this would be a good game, but Midway blew it again. But if you enjoy playing NFL BLitz or NBA Showtime and want some fun buy this game.	-1
Why 1 star? Because you need it. Otherwise you can not use DVDs on your X-Box.  I do not understand how Microsoft can release such a simple remote.  This isn't a remote control, it's a toy that belongs with the likes of Little Tikes.  Remote controls represent manhood, this item represents Happy Meals. Look at Sony's "official" remote control for the PS2.  Look at the button options.  Why did Microsoft feel that they should produce such a simple product? Onscreen menus instead of button selections? I feel cheated.  I even called the X-Box help desk and inquired about a good remote control and was treated with: "That is the final product.  There will be no other option.  Maybe a second generation company will produce one you are satisfied with."	-1
OK, you can watch DVD's on the XBox. But, did we tell you that you had to buy another gadget to unlock that feature? NO!!! You can slap in a CD, and a nice little onscreen menu pops up that you can use the game controller to use. But, you have to go buy something else if you want to watch a DVD....  Also, it won't scan into a song.  I have a CD with some VERY long songs.  I want to get to the middle of the song, and not hear the whole thing, but I can't.  Also needs an off button very badly.	-1
... The game itself, while somewhat neat looking, was ridiculous. I felt like I was being attacked by hordes of MUPPETS, as that's what the enemies looked like. The weapons were all stupid and unrealistic...	-1
This ame is terrible just terrible..it's just an average shooting game but only it has the WORST controls [it takes a joystick and a button to climb a ladder]..and the graphics are bad...it's just plain bad	-1
The package was crack and when my daughter tried to play it it kept freezing. It cost to much for all that. Not happy with it.	-1
did not work.  our xbox may be the issue though	-1
If this game were a multiplayer only game, i would actually give it a much higher score then two stars. The reason being that the only fun part of this miserable game is the multiplayer and when you have friends over. On your own, it is just a discrase with horrible A.I, graphics, gameplay and audio, all this added together equals a very bad game.  I will now split my review into sections of graphics, gameplay and audio. Of course this game doesn't have online capabilites because it came out before Xbox Live was even released. To be honest, if Xbox Live had come out at the very beginning and this game supported online play, i would probobly give it a 3/5 because of its extremely fun gameplay when you are playing against one another offline.  Graphics- The graphics in Fuzion Frenzy are definetely ones to be embarassed about. With horrible character models, background design and retarded looking features on each "map", the graphics portion of the game is definetely lacking in deatail. It reminds me of something that you would find out of a gameboy advance now a days, actually, come to think about it, this games graphics are probobly worse then even that. Thus if the graphics were better in Fuzion Frenzy, i would give the game a much higher score, but please, graphics like these just aren't acceptable!  Gameplay- The gameplay in Fuzion Frenzy is extremely simplistic as well. Basically, when you are accessed to the menu of Fuzion Frenzy, you are given the choice to enter a tournament or you can choose mini games that you can play on your own or with friends. The game is made up of at least 45 minigames, each one of the at least 45 minigames requires a maximum of three buttons out of all of them on the Xbox controller to be used. Sad! If you enter a tournament, you can choose between two, four, or six stages, each stage consisting of four random minigames that fit that stage and then a final game which they call "Fuzion Frenzy" where you can basically gamble the points that have earned for the other games and depending on whether you lose or win, will get processed to the final rank of that stage putting you in a certain position from characters doing the best to the ones doing the worst.  Like i said before, the gameplay is extremely simplistic which makes it really boring at times and it forces you to just shut off your Xbox console.  However, if you are playing multiplayer, it is a much different story considering that there is actually a challenge (most of the time) and the players actually know what they are doing instead of the incredibly dull and stupid A.I running all over the place.  Audio- Oh god, the worst part of this miserable discraceful game is yet to come. The audio! Every time you play a minigame there is this annoying voice counting you down until the game starts. As the game progresses the annoyvoice does as well providing you with "helpful" commentary. Also did i not mention that the music in Fuzion Frenzy are produced by wannabe techno DJ's? Well now i have, and yet another reason not to buy Fuzion Frenzy.  In conclusion, this game would get a lot higher rating if they had made it "multiplayer only" but enhanced the features a lot more and provided us with a little more complicated minigames. But for now, its just a wannabe game that didn't get anywhere in terms of money made, and in my opinion, never will.	-1
Fuzion Frenzy is...in many ways...fun!  There are close to 50 games, a bunch of characters, and lots of things to try.  Unfortunantly, the games have no real purpose, no real rules, and each uses such different controls...its hard to get into a flow.  Here's what I thought of Microsoft's Fuzion Frenzy: 1) The Gameplay: Well, there are dozens of games to try, and u can play with up to 4 players.  The graphics are pretty good and the game is pretty fun.  The problem?  The gameplay is repetitive, the controls stink, and it seems like a game that tried to be 3 or 4 different games and in fact doesn't seem in any way it's own. You start out by picking a game type.  Multiplayer, single player, tournament, arcade, etc...  In Arcade for example, u can pick any game and play it over and over again...or pick another game.  You can do this with as many players as u want. Once u pick a game type, and how many people are playing, you pick a character.  The problem begins here.  The players seem to be different through color and gender, not through persounallity.  Each person just seems to be either a green guy or a pink girl.  They hardly ever talk, have no persounality or grudges or talents, and seem to just be there.  This was a major problem, as I never found anyone to be my "favorite."  It's not like Mario Party, where each character is different and fun to try.  Here, everyone seems to be the same...and they are.  Another problem is no one seems to have a face.  Just eyes, a nose, a mouth.  They don't react, smile, talk.  No mustaches, long hair.  Each person is so similar, u won't care who u pick.  That's a MAJOR problem. The games, thankfully, are for the most part, fun.  There's 45 mini-games to try, each pretty fun.  There are games where you hop in Vehicles and do things.  For example, try not to hit each others tail, or knock the other off the sumo court (it continues to shrink, and you try to push the other 3 people's ball-shaped vehichles off...like SUMO).  You have games where u collect the most valuables, kill the most bugs, etc...  When u win a mini-game, in a tournament, u get points.  1st gets the most, followed by second, third, fourth, etc...  You add up points through about 10 mini-games.  The winner gets bragging rights.  Unfortunantly, 45 mini-games isn't that much to choose from, the characters aren't that interesting.  In the end, it gets very dull.  And not all of the games are good. Some are just boring and seem to be impossible, and can take 15-20 minutes just to understand.  That's no fun (especially at a sleepover or party (where this game is aimed at)).  The controls aren't very good, and with just 45 mini-games, all of them needed to be.  Not the case here, and may have killed this game's gameplay. 2) Graphics: Decent, but nothing the PS2 or GC couldn't handle.  The water looks decent and plain, the characters have no real special affects.  The envirements are vibrant and colorful, but nothing great.  This was a launch game by Microsoft, where they boasted the best graphics in the world...yet these graphics were nothing new.  They get the job done, but don't in ANY way save the game.  The graphics were good...but any console now a' days can do good.  What we want is GREAT! 3) Options: Several.  You can play all types of games in all types of modes, create how long your game is, how hard, etc...very good.  There are a lot of characters, a lot of games, and a lot of different things to try.  There are a lot of options...but it didn't save the game. Overall, if u have NO multiplayer games, u might want to pick this up (especially for it's price).  It is fun, it is pretty unique, but it needs a LOT of improvent.  I enjoyed playing it, it did have a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't anything I'd brag about to my friends.  This is a good game that the whole family (girls...boys at any age), and if u find a good deal, u might want to pick it up. Just don't expect Mario Party here.  It's a good game, with decent graphics, but gets pretty old fairly quickly. Hope this helped, Thx!	-1
This game had potential.........but they never worked out the bugs! I find myself worrying about whether the stupid game is going to crash more than winning it! Not only that but you have to start the research projects all over again when the game crashes...even if you saved it. The animals also have issues....like my penguins who after a few months in zoo time froze. I truly was disappointed next time I hope Microsoft fixes the game b4 they release it However despite all this...I mastered the game in a few days. Maybe I became tired with the game because I never got far enough to unlock the secrets, which cannot be done if the game crashes every two seconds.	-1
Be warned, if you are looking for a game similar to Tetris, Bust-a-move or any of the other very addictive multi-player games do not buy fusion frenzy. If you are looking for a game to play with many friends who have little skill on a gaming system then this is for you.  There are an abudance of games, but many of them are similar to each other and the variation is no where near as great as it could be. Additionally, the one-player versions of the games are weak and are of little enjoyment to play alone. Bottom line is that if you choose to purchase this game no what you are getting, a game for people with little gaming skills that can be picked up very quickly.  The graphics are good for what it is but make very little use of the xbox's potential. Good Gaming!	-1
People say one of the drawbacks for this game is--because it is too much like Roller Coaster Tycoon. However, I, a lover of almost all simulation games and Roller Coaster Tycoon, I disliked this game. Unless you find the concept exciting, do NOT buy this game. Unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon the scenarios are much more boring and broad and after a while (for me, two or three hours) the game became monotanous and boring. It was definately not worth the money and now it is sitting on a quiet dusty shelf. Also, unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon this game appeals to younger age groups. My friend's on (12 yrs. old) loves this game with a passion. So to conclude, I would only recommend buying this game if..... -The idea of building a zoo appeals to you. -If, you are not buying for youself, primarily younger people will take an interest in this. -You don't mind a somewhat monotonous game play.	-1
I cant see why people call halo the greatest fps of all time. i played the game at a friends house and i was expecting more from the game. the single player was simply pointless. there was no point to it. the 2 stars are for the multiplayer, which is fun for the first 15 minutes and then gets repetitive and boring. the graphics are ok but the controls are truly horrible. the whole x-box controller design is horrible for that matter. Max Payne, especially on PC, is a much more interesting and enjoyable game than halo. a disappointment.	-1
Not a big fan of all the language and violence.  My  sons really wanted it but I reallly don't care for them to play it even though theyh are teens.	-1
Pros: None   Cons: Bad Graphics   Boring Gameplay   Money System guarentees you'll be broke unless you stick to th tightest budget possible.   [It's just like] Roller Coaster Tycoon   Unecaseraly Hard   More furnishing animals cages and keeping them happy than running a zoo   Price is overdown this plays like [a]game out off a bargain box   With in 25% hour of playing it you'll start to loose intrest	-1
Love this game series. Love playing GTA Liberty City and GTA Vice City on PSP & PS2. I have played them both to completion on each system many times. Love them. Nothing better. However, this game is frustrating because it has no pop up/pull down or whatever you want to call it, map. No map! Just the radar circle thing at the bottom of the screen. Then you're given timed missions with (did I mention) NO MAP! Driving around blind, frustrated and running out of time - I turned the game off and havn't returned and I don't think I ever will. NO MAP!	-1
When GTA3 came out, I did not get around to it.  Here I am, eight years after the fact coming back to it to see how it plays and compares with later games in the series.  It doesn't fare as well.  I'm an old enough gamer (28) to still appreciate how revolutionary this game was for its time, both gameplay and pushing the envelope on what they could get released for a console (unfortunately still branded as a child's toy by much of society).  Still, the game is not much fun to play, even compared to its immediate successor Vice City.  For starters, navigating the city is itself un-fun.  With no big map overview its hard to get oriented.  Much of the landscape/architecture doesn't stand out, so I found myself navigaing by remembering road curves/intersection angles on the small immediate-area map.  This is further hindered by objectives that you don't get to see where they are, only what direction they are in (until you're close enough to see them onscreen).  Also, finding the Pay N Spray (While being hounded by the authorities) is difficult without any locational indicatord until you've been on an island for an hour or two to get familiar.  Many of the missions are simply not passable on the first try.  They're not that diffcult in the end, but most will likely take 2+ tries to figure out exactly what you're doing.  It usually has suprises like suddenly getting 5 stars wanted rating (or attacked by a half-dozen driving members of some gang) or suprise insta-killed by the FBI (or some other government people) abound.  Ocasionally it reqires out of the box thinking to react to an event and kill someone before they can get away (ie you have to know to block a certain alley with a bus/fire truck to cutoff an escape route beforehand or else its almost impossible to catch up).  The biggest fun-killer though is the constant aribtrary time limits that get thrown on the missons.  Bugs abound.  I've had missions where targets become invincible, people I'm supposed to pick up in a vehcile don't appear, or they get stuck and stop following, or spawn inside a building/terrain feature and get stuck.  Still, the game has some good aspects that stand out even now.  While the graphics are relatively bland, there is a lot going on and the game almost never hiccups or loses framerate.  The voice acting is above average even for nowadays; it must have been spectacular 8 years ago.  It's got that Rockstar polish...that touch of irreverant humor and good storytelling (even if its limited and your character has no personality; literally).  GTA3 was a great and revolutionary game when it came, and set the ground for not only sequels, but launched a new genre of game.  The numerous improvements that have been made over the years though expose a lot of the gliches and problems in this one though.  Unless you are bound and determined to play all of the GTA games like me (or have already played them) I recommend steering clear of this one and getting one of its successors.	-1
Grand Theft Auto III is the kind of a game that is immersed in popularity so deep that it actually has more cons than pros. There are too many negatives about playing Grand Theft Auto III due to numerous useless and pointless missions, limitedness of freedom, repetitive playing, constant use of X button, lack of ability to save the game when needed, and ridiculous storyline and miscellaneous information. Let me get the positives out of the way first. For one, Grand Theft Auto III looks cool for its playing features, and the ideas of what to expect are of high level. There is a plenty to do around each of three islands. It took me about a couple of months to beat Grand Theft Auto III, so more bang out of the money. Several special types of missions are fun such as rampages and unique jumps. Now for the negatives as they are many of them. Novelty of a game can only wear off that it's no longer replayable. Grand Theft Auto III is no exception to this case. I beat this game a while ago, and I showed some interest in playing it again few years later. What I had forgotten about Grand Theft Auto III is how monotonous the game is. I perfectly outlined my objectives for each island of three: Cab, Fire, Cop, Jumps, Packages, RC Rampages, and Missions. Each of them (not the RC anyway) takes too damned long to finish. The worst aspect of Grand Theft Auto III is the dreadful Ambulance mission. It takes a good two hours to finish this one; there are twelve levels (level 1, save one person; level 2, save two persons; etc.). If the ambulance is either flipped over or shot up, I am back to square one and must do it all over again. In the midst of this, there is no allowing of saving at any point of the mission. It has to be completely done from start to finish. Actually, I reached level 12 and saved nine people. Then suddenly, I flipped the ambulance over not because I wasn't paying attention but my thumb literally got tired. Of course, my mind got numbed, and I grew frustrated at the idea of doing it again. I understand that those missions along with cab, fire, and cop are to familiarize myself with the geography of each island. My suggestion to improve the game play, why not just have 20 cab missions on one island, 20 fire the second island, and 20 cop for third island? Maybe ten levels of ambulance are okay and allow me to begin at the highest level possible where I screwed up. Whenever I am doing something on each island, ninety percent of the time my thumb is constantly on the X button. It gets sore after a while. The tedious driving around and going from point A to point B can be thought of preliminary stages of Alzheimer's. It's no fun. As for the real missions, they are all right for RPG but nothing special. The storyline is ridiculous at best; why not get the main character to make a name for himself as he rises to the top as Mafia hood boss or something? Speaking of the protagonist, who is he? What is his name? What does he really look like? What can he do? What is he interested in? The statistics are helpful, but must I know how many inches of rain fell, or total people wasted, or weight of explosives used, or total amount of money paid by cops? When I pointed out limitedness of freedom, mainly I have objectives that I must complete and when I am in midst of them, I feel the rigidity that I must follow this way and no other way. The game is not actually hard to beat, but it's not that easy either. All in all, Grand Theft Auto III is full of cycles repeated to death until 100% completion is reached. When that is accomplished, is there a sense of satisfaction? Not really. And no, I still can't fly the freaking Dodo (and it's not even necessary either...what a waste of intrigue.)	-1
I wish I won the lottery, but that's for people with hope. I have hope. You'd have a better chance at....blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's the way it always is. PLUS YOU'D HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT LIKING THIS!! IT IS SO BORING! I might never win the lottery just like all of those S.O.B.s who have all of it to themselves!!!!!!!!!!!! It makes me furious. Even though in the series, this game leads straight to Vice City, AT LEAST THE MAIN CHARACTER HAS A FRIGGIN' PERSONALITY IN THAT GAME!!!! I don't know yet how good San Andreas is either. The graphics for GTA 3 are just plain crappy, you don't have a code for weapons, and when you kill someone, it doesn't sound like you're trying to. Everything echoes for some reason when you go down hills of streets {shrug}. If you want a better game, play GTA VICE CITY, DRAGONBALL Z BUDOKAI, or MK DEADLY ALLIANCE. You will not only get blood, but a lot of good, fun violence.	-1
I've heard of the things about all  the Grand Theft Auto games and they're ...  It's ... to go around killing innocent people and police men.  It's ... to go around destroying people's property.  This applies to everyone.  I've never actually played this game but I've learned things about it.  It's ... don't buy it!	-1
I know, I know.  This game is innovative, a venture into the new world.  It brings video gaming to the next level.  I will admit, this game was creative, the concept is pretty good, and at times it can be fun.  But the overall gameplay is just a bit too gory for my taste.  Here's what I thought after a few hours of GTA3: 1. The graphics: pretty good.  I disagree with anyone who said this game lacked graphics.  I own an XBOX and hate PS2's graphics, but I was impressed by the many things this game supports.  There are dozens of cars, bridges, people, shops, trees, guns, and just about everything else.  The world looks real and comes alive!  The weather changes, and the worlds are HUGE!  As much as I hated all the gore, this game definantly looked pretty awsome in every other way.  Grade: B+ 2. The gameplay: ok...if u like going around shooting people to death.  There's way to much blood, and the way u can just keep hitting people again and again with the bat or the gun just gets sickening.  The blood is everywhere, and it really takes the quote "Fun" out of the game.  The whole concept of hejacking cars is cool, and swithcing cars again and again or running on foot was pretty cool (while trying to escape the police).  You can hejack anything from regular old jeeps to Taxi's, Police Cars, Ambulances, Fire Trucks, Vipers, Tanks, and anything else out there.  Once again, all this would have been fun, even shooting people...without the gore.  This game could have been so much more, but instead, it's just sickening.  Gangs are everywhere, FREEDOM is everything.  But overall, I just didn't find it fun, in fact quite the opposite.  Grade: C- 3. Replay value: I can see how an extreme person might like this game, and if u can handle shooting people's head off to see a fountain of blood, go ahead.  But overall, the game made me feel like a criminal, nothing else.  But if u do like this kind of game, there are dozens of missions, freedom beyond your largest dreams, and cash to earn.  Rival gangs and kick police ....  The concept was awsome...it just didn't click for me.  Grade: B- Well, I hope this helped, and if your sickened by gore like me, you probably won't like this game.  A sour feeling left in my mouth, I will never be a GTA fan, and could care less if one of them makes there way on to the XBOX.  My friend likes it, he can like it.  It justn't didn't click with me.  Would it with u?	-1
Ever wished that James Bond was wearing concrete boots in Goldeneye? Well, Bungie has made this fantasy a reality with Halo. Don't worry about falling out of your seat; Halo keeps the gameplay at a crawl...Not much fun, but a great way to ease into siesta.	-1
I have this game(sadly). Beleive me, the movie is 10 times better. The game doesn't even feature "Donkey", come on. But for real, the objectives are too hard for a kiddy game like this and well, just not that fun. Not an I want it, I want it gift: definetely a: "Oh, thanks Grandma" kind of thing	-1
...But, let's take a look at the whole picture. True, the city is huge within its respective townships, but all the pedestrians are limited to a few in reality.  Next, the character modeling is okay, but far from being great.  Third, the game's "missions" and other things become tedious after the 1000th time that you have done them.  Even provoking the police gets boring after a while.  Additionally, there was very little storyline or cinematics to provide an actual story.  For example, the character's ex-girlfriend all the sudden becomes a factor on the last mission.  I wish there were radio or television broadcasts that would display who or what the character affected.  Like if you murdered a mafia boss, the news would display what you did, on television or something.  Also, what's up with NPGs all the suddenly disappearing after the missions are completed?  That's a cheap tactic for the developers to limit the storyline and make it shallower than it already is. The only thing going for the game is the freedom involved, but with all that freedom, the game is full of itself.  The game doesn't portray the grittiness of the streets. In fact, the Don of the La Cosa Nostra wouldn't like this game either.  It's just too incredibly boring after a while.  Hopefully, games in the future such as The Getaway will resolve this inordinate shallowness of Grand Theft Auto 3.	-1
$21.95 for 8MB of memory??!!  This is unacceptable.  8MB equates to around 500 blocks of space for the XBOX.  500 blocks would only hold one Splinter Cell save, there are some games (KOTOR) that you can't even save because the file is too big.  Sure the XBOX has a massive hard drive, but what about those of us who want to back up our hours of game play in case the XBOX has problems and require service?  You hard drive will more than likely lose all of your data after it returns from service.  What if your hard drive just quits on you one day?  If you want to back up your XBOX data in case a catastrophe occurs, you have two options 1).  Purchase anywhere from 50 - 100 of these little Memory Units at $22 a pop 2).  Purchase a bigger memory card, like MegaXKey, or Max Drive for XBOX, that hold 4 times the space for only $10 more.  On top of both of these cards also allow you to moves your XBOX saves to your PC's hard drive and even burn them to a CD.  Because of the included USB to XBOX adapter you can connect these to both your PC and XBOX; this means you can back up all of your savable game files to your PC by only having to buy one memory card.  Better yet, use of these items do not require your XBOX to be modded in anyway. After backing up all of my data to my PC, I restored them to my XBOX and had no problems with the files although the Max Drive is a little more user friendly and also can go up to 64MB!  XBOX's are composed of man-made mechanical items that will eventually fail or have problems.  No one wants to lose all of their data just because they are unable to back up their stuff.  It is too bad Microsoft forces their customer to depend on the hard drive only since they do not offer a cost-effective, efficient method of back up.  To add insult to injury, they don't even offer bigger memory cards!  8MB is the largest and ONLY memory card option they have!  I love my XBOX, but Microsoft really needs to get with the program here and offer bigger memory cards and also an option to back up saved game files.  If other companies can do it, why can't they?  Unless you want to carry around a pocketful of these tiny memory cards, your best option for back up is something like MegaXKey or MaxDrive.  Unless you are just using the memory card for saving small game files like rosters or settings, then I don't think Microsoft's memory cards are worth the money.	-1
So you bought an Xbox and you want some memory? I think years of console experience has ingrained into our heads that we MUST have a memory card. In the past that has been more than true (try having a Dreamcast without several). Years of PC experience has always made me laugh at console gamers for reasons such as this, but that didn't stop me from buying a memory card when I picked up my Xbox on Nov 16th. The only thing keeping me from saying, "and boy what a mistake that was" is the fact that some day I might actually have a use for the thing. Someday I might need to have my information portable. Of course I did also buy the custom Xbox backpack so I can easily transport my Xbox anywhere, so why do I really need this? The Xbox has over six gigabytes of hard drive space. It translates that info into memory blocks. When you view your Xbox HD memory it only says 50,000+ blocks. Now I own five Xbox titles (Halo, DOA3, Project Gotham, Fuzion Frenzy, and Amped) and all of their saved games are saved to the hard drive. I also have three full music CDs copied to the disk and the box still says I have 50,000+ memory available. Don't worry about running out of room on your hard drive. Six gigabytes is an enormous amount or space. While I'm sure this is a solid product as far as quality goes, it is insanely over priced. Now if Microsoft would have gone the Sega route and made VMUs I could see paying 30-40 bucks for them, because at least then they would have some use. If you still really want to own a memory card, by an aftermarket one as they are almost half the cost, and you really aren't going to use it much. Trust me.	-1
For the first couple days, this seemed like the best game in the world.  Once the initial thrill is gone, however, it just gets terribly monotonous.  There are several game-play modes, but "battle" is the only one you'll ever play.  (Yes it is, don't argue!)  Seriously, straight racing you can do on ANY car game, this one's selling point is the characters' interaction with eachother.  You'll be cracking up when you hear the one-liners being passed around...untill you notice they're the same 2 over and over, and then that little green "MUTE" word your TV puts in the corner gets irritating. One thing I will defend on this game is the cartoon-cel graphics. People complain that the XBOX version could've been more realistic.  It's SUPPOSED to be a cartoon, people!	-1
I loved the Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and the Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus games!  The whole concept of puzzle solving raised above everything else, the idea that there is no life bar ("Do, or do not", there is no "I barely made it through, but I only lost half my life"), it's totally gutted from the game!  Argh!  Who took a great idea, an awesome concept, and pissed it all away by making it like every other game out there?!  Sure, they kept the same great world, with those great characters, and the same humor, but what happened to the fundamental elements that made Oddworld stand apart from all the other games?!  Now it's more like the Ratchet & Clank, the Jax & Daxter, or the Sly Cooper games (but it's not as good as Ratchet & Clank or Sly Cooper).  What happened to the challenging puzzle solving play concepts that made the previous Oddworld games so great?!  Whoever made the decision to be more like other games on the market, to stop being their own different and original game line, really screwed the pooch on this one.  This new direction in the Oddworld games makes it nothing more than one of many generic games in an over saturated genre.  It's really sad to see the great succession of Abe's Oddworld games come to this.  I played this as far as I could maintain interest in it, I really wanted to see more of the world, the humor, and the clips with the Glukkons (bad guys), but the game was just lacking.  I found myself just running through areas, while just trying to avoid taking too much damage, and not really focusing on real game play.  But that was the problem: There was a lack of that challenging game play that made the Oddworld series so great.  And the camera and controls were irritating.  I'm through with this game: for what it is, it isn't worth playing just to try to see the interesting clips and humor that might be in there.  I might see what the next Oddworld game looks like, but if it's like this one (Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee) then I'm done with anything new from Oddworld.  I am really disappointed.	-1
I was very excited to try this game... The reality is that this game is sick.  What kind of a reflection on our society is it that we produce a game which glorifies beating old people with bats, running over cops, and shooting cops.  I am not against violence per se, because we have all grown up playing cowboys and Indians, or cops and robbers, pretending to have guns and shooting each other.  That has been going on since time immemorial, ever since it was cave dweller vs. bear.  Many games involve shooting or death, but usually you are on some kind of quest to save the world.  In this game, you are glorified for senseless acts of cruelty.  I do not find this amusing or even "funny."  After playing for a few hours, I felt dirty, as though I were committing evil.  If you pretend to ...[commit crimes], that is not a good thing.	-1
I give this game a little credit on the graphics but other than that it's pretty annoying, from the controls (especially Munch)to the character's voices. This isn't my style of game but I'm sure some will like it.	-1
It was my mistake I guess, but this game is for the first Xbox, so it is kind of too old. I wish they would have the same one for the new Xbox.	-1
Before I start, I would like to state that I am a die-hard EA fan... especially for their sports games.  & in addition I think that the NHL series is the best sports series ever.  The games for genesis were ground-breaking & the computer games perfected the realistic feel.  That said, this is the WORST NHL hockey game i have ever played & i've played every single one (so i'm a video game nut).  The game is virtually ruined by the slow gamepace.  the players skate very slowly, especially when they have the puck.  if you have a breakaway, you can bet that someone will hack you down (or just kind of skate around you) before you get close to the goalie.  So considering that the defense skates twice as fast as the offense you would think that you may get some nice checks & physical gameplay... wrong!  the checking is mild & unrealistic.  It doesn't even account for momentum.  This means that a standing check is just as devastating as a check where you have a running head start.  Even the original NHL back in '92 accounted for this.  As a final gripe, the players aren't accurately rated, something EA is usually good at.	-1
This takes a while so be patient. Pros: 1. First Simpsons title since 1998 2. Much Better than Simpsons Wrestling 3. Real voices by simpsons actors. 4. Many a shortcut on this game. 5. a fun 2 player game 6. some good jokes... Cons: 1. ...that get repetitive faster than the color commentator on NHL 2003! 2. graphics look like Robotech:Battlecry meets Superman (boo hoo hoo!) 3. difficulty settings are just too easy (its actually easier to get $$$ on hard) 4. voiceovers get repetitive in one run! 5. little plot at all, just the problem and the solution, no plot twists or the sort. too predictable 6. Mission mode: WAY too easy! 7. voiceovers lag badly. 8. all about the objective in the end (not good for a comedy king like the simpsons) 9. End Sequence not that good. 10. In game lips do not even move at all! 11. Cut scene graphics are much better than in In Game (did i mention that the cut scenes with Montgomery Burns get repetitive too) 12. Loading times are RIDICULOUSLY SLOW! oh man such a poor game graphically and it takes so long to load. (Ouch!) Final Verdict: RENT FIRST![.] It would have been an ACCEPTABLE game for the N64, but they don't even tamper with the Xbox's potential. A lamentable day for all simpsons fans	-1
This game is amusing, stupid, and wierd.  It is a copy of crazy taxi with a lot of stupid extras (that make the game even worste.)  Do yourself a favor, and do not buy this game.	-1
Nice graphics, a few exciting moments, and kinda cute. But the gameplay is bland and and doesn't do a good job of captivating the player.	-1
this game really [stinks]! who thought this game would rock? i hated it! i got my hopes up because it recieved so much hype. i talked to others that have played this game and they all said that they were turned of by it. overall, i think this game is boring. i actually liked the demo better that the actual game itself. i thought the worst thing about it is that you need soooo many power-ups to progress though the game (very time consuming).and one player mode is boring, maybe if there were at least a two player mode than it would be a lot better. words of advice! DON'T BUY IT!, EVEN IF IT IS ON SALE!, IF YOU ARE REALLY TEMPTED RENT IT!!! and the only reason i rated it a one is because the graphics are pretty cool!	-1
I rented this one and I'm glad I did.  You might enjoy a rental, as well.  If you absolutely love The Simpsons (like me) and think there's no way you wouldn't enjoy anything Simpsons related (come on, you've got the first season on DVD, don't you?), you will still be disappointed.  If you aren't convinced, I still say rent it, just so you are sure. It is not as horrible as Simpsons Wrestling.  This game is at least playable.  Still, it never feels like you are driving a car, however, or any of the other vehicles you supposedly drive.  It's more like you are just pivoting an arrow on its axis and pushing a button to move forward and backward.  No I'm not expecting a sim experience like Project Gotham, but at least a driving experience, like Crazy Taxi. After you unlock a few levels, you'll get bored.  It becomes even more repetitive than Crazy Taxi ever did.  The most ardent Simpsons fanatic might insist on unlocking the relatively large cast of characters, and who doesn't want to drive Homer as Mr. Plow? But the fun wears off.  In a short time, you'll have heard all the banter of every character and gotten over the fun of driving around a very sparsely detailed Springfield.  Not that all the Springfield landmakrs aren't there, they just look terrible.  Once you've played Halo, you expect a little more than buildings that are nearly flat shaded boxes.  I hear this looks better on Xbox than PS2, but that's not saying much. I think the development team also made a major mistake trying to make the Simpsons a 3D world.  It looks funny.  Your Simpsons heroes don't look right.  If you have the First Season DVD you've heard (in the commentary) that the show producers realized early that the 2D side perspective of faces were so much more expressive than the other views they tried in that first season.  A similar view holds for this game.  The Simpsons Road Rage would have looked beautiful if done in the style of Cel Damage.  Cel Damage's engine does 3D but it looks flat, like you are watching a cartoon.  It is absolutely stunning in that perspective (gameplay problems in that title aside).  The Simpsons Road Rage would have benefitted greatly just by using a similar engine and graphical feel. When you finish a level you'll be irritated that they couldn't have the real Krusty voice give you your rating.  Instead, you get a horrible imitation.  You'll also wonder why you have to view a loading screen (on the Xbox no less!) to go from the game to your summary screen.  Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast didn't even do this! You'll also realize that the key to unlocking items has nothing to do with your ability to play the game.  You just play long enough and you'll eventually unlock it all.  But it won't matter if you get better at the game. This is a game unworthy of the Xbox.  However, the Simpsons tie-in is not too bad.  I would suggest renting it for a week and getting your fill of Simpsons laughs.  Hence the two stars.	-1
I really wanted to enjoy "The Simpson's: Road Rage" because I am to the point where I pity the "The Simpson's" license in the context of the incredibly competitive video game world. The last string of "Simpson's" games have been nothing but complete, almost unplayable disasters. It's not saying a whole lot when I hear people are raving that "Road Rage is THE best Simpson's game!" Yes, it is the most competent "Simpson's" game undoubtedly but still somehow manages to a sad, highly unoriginal bore.  "Hello. Am I speaking to the legal department of Electronic Arts? Yes, this is the legal team at Sega America and we are just calling to let you know that we are suing you breaking copyright." How that call never happened is beyond me. "Road Rage" rips EVERYTHING from the stellar Sega hit "Crazy Taxi" except the fun! Considering Sega's title is way over a year old so it's very peculiar that "Road Rage" in no way, shape or form decides to build on the "taxi" formula and make it into something of it's own. Yes, "Road Rage" has arguably better graphics (considering the hardware leap from Dreamcast to XBOX, it's nothing to write home about), many more vehicles and arenas, faster gameplay and the occasional hilarity of "The Simpson's" license but the gameplay surprisingly is nowhere as fun, challenging or deep as Sega's "Crazy Taxi."  There are 4 gameplay modes: Road Rage, Sunday Drive, Mission Mode and Head to Head. The premise of "Road Rage" is simple. You choose one of various Simpson's characters, drive around picking up various Simpson's characters and drop them off as quickly as possible while listening to audio excerpts of the characters dialog repeat. Depending on how quickly you delivered your passenger the higher the pay you receive. Sounds mighty familiar hey? This cycle is fun for about an hour then torturous soon after. "Road Rage's" in game clock is incredibly inconsistant and will sometimes give you less then 5 seconds to get your passenger to their destination a few blocks away when you still have a fair amount of time left of total game time or it'll give you 40 seconds to drive one block; it flat out kills the fun. Sunday Drive is exactly what the title implies; driving around town with no time limit or objectives exploring the arena's whatnots. Mission Mode is a pathetic, abundantly unfun exercise in running various objects over within a set amount of time. Head to Head is the only reason to play this game. The 2-player madness can be very entertaining but Head to Head has lame restrictions and doesn't flow as seemlessly (I mean this very loosely) as the 1-Player experience.  Cars or characters - which ever you want to call them - handle one of three ways. There are the fast cars are extremely touchy (Apu's Sports Car), balanced cars that have a satisfactory top speed and handle adequately but sound like they are stuck in second gear (Marge's 4x4 Canonaro) and the slow, borderline useless clunkers (Auto's School Bus). Most people will find themselves sticking to the unforgiving, speed orientated cars because once mastered (which doesn't take a whole lot of time) domination is inevitable.  The arenas range from o.k. to barely playable. "Evergreen Terrace" and the "Entertainment District" are the most balanced levels and the majority of gamers will find themselves playing those two most often. While their premise is novel arenas like "The Springfield Dam" and "Springfield Mountains" are too difficult to navigate due to their immensity and poor level design. "Downtown" suffers from sporadic slowdown and frame-rate dives that create a slightly nauseating experience. Roads in these are too narrow and hitting the side of the course can bring your cars to a complete stop. Not to mention Mr. Burns and his entirely spastic "atomic buses" blocking the road entirely and pushing your car into walls will leave an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.  Graphically "Road Rage" in really nothing to get excited over. The colorful, Simpson'esque atmosphere is suiting but visuals aren't as crisp as one should expect from the XBOX. There is a minor texture blur that reminds me a great deal - to a lesser degree - of the graphical style of the N64 title "South Park."  I am really happy the voice actors from the TV series recorded some new material for the game. I am really annoyed that they recorded so little. Phrases are very funny the first 10 or so times, but by the time the second or third game loads up using the same character you will have had it. Lisa, one of my favorite character on the show has very few things to say and soon becomes unmistakably irritating. Same can be said for the almost the entire cast of characters.  Lastly I have to touch on how unacceptably glitchy "Road Rage" is. I've had cars get stuck on walls, in the middle of the road and occasionally get stuck onto another car. Sometimes I had to quit the game because my car was wedged indefinitely. The collision detection needs a great deal of work. I can't tell you the last time I played a game where if you got enough air time you could fly through background scenery into gray, video game limbo and float there until your time eventually expires. Also the load times, which are nowhere near as horrible as the PS2 version's, are still noticeably bad. Consider how low tech this game appears and how powerful the XBOX is, the time spent at the "Now Loading..." screen is utterly unsatisfactory. "Road Rage" has "rushed" plastered all over it.  Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this uninspired rip-off. I heard Sega will eventually port "Crazy Taxi 2" to the XBOX. I recommend investing in the originator, not settling for a half-baked designer imposter.	-1
This game is horrible with tons of unneccisary killing. Graphics:4/10: The guys are all blocky. Not nearly what it was made out to be. Sound:9/10. Okay. I have to give it props on it's more than great voice acting but that does not redeam this horrible game. Story:3/10: Go around and blow people up. This game focus's way more on killing than stealing cars. Replay:4/10. It's all the same. Steal, shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot Steal shoot shoot etc. Characters:3/10. Brainless stupid, evil people. Pros: Great voice acting Cons: Lots of evil mindless slaughter. Little story. bland graphics. An insult to your intellegence Overall fun:2/10: Buy this game if you get pleasure from watching people die cruel painful deaths. If not play a good Action adventure game like Devil may cry or onimusha.	-1
Want a boring experience with clumsy play control? Then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up. You will appreciate Mario and Sonic more, but that still won't get you your money back.	-1
I bought this game and played it since it got such rave reviews from this website and I sucessfully completed many missions. However, the game was just not fun! Stealing cars and having sex in the car is only fun for so long. The game gets awefully repetitive and boring and I don't recommend this game. Very over-hyped. If you want to play the best, get Gran Turismo 3.	-1
Choppy framerate, confusing graphics, sluggish controls, and it's well boring.  This doesn't look like an XBox game at all... Do yourself a favor and stay away from this...thing.  There are so many better games on XBox.	-1
Sure,I liked Hydro Thunder on N64 but this is TO MUCH!!! I must say WaveRace:BlueStorm is a better buy on a better buy system!	-1
Honestly, unless you're LucasArts completist collector, there's no longer any reason to buy this game.  With the pending sequel, JEDI STARFIGHTER, many of the things that annoyed people about STARFIGHTER SE (like its highly inadequate multiplayer environment) are going to be addressed--and, we hope, resolved.  GIve this one a miss.	-1
DOA3 looks great, it's graphics are incredible...and if that was all it took to make a great game this would be one, however, that is NOT all it takes.   There are a lot of moves to learn in this game; all of which are nearly useless: because by the time you've entered the button sequence your opponent has mashed you into the floor with stupid button smashing, rendering all your hard work useless.  Eventually the player always comes back to simple punch and kick combos, making gameplay completly without depth.   Then there's the story and endings...hardly any of which have a point or even make a little sense.   The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because it's enjoyable to change the female characters cloths and look up their dresses when their throwing high kicks.   If your a more serious fighting gamer who enjoys utilizing a characters moves and combos, go somwhere else; DOA3 is almost a  pure button smasher.	-1
This game became boring after two hours. The graphics are great the shallowness and laughable plot detract too much. The endings are visually impressive but again, are so absurd that I couldn't help but laugh (although "Christy's" ending was interesting). Two player was OK, but it doesn't get more involved than the usual button mashing. Rent it and don't waste your money (besides, Tecmo already sold a million copies, they don't need the business).	-1
Alright, that's enough people, wait for Tekken4 VF4, or even Soul Calibur2 no matter how long it takes. It's worth the wait.	-1
WHy? the first 2 were AWSOME! This one (is just bad)!! I beat it at the (...)Store!! Gamecube is BETTER! XBOX (is bad). It looks like Dead or alive 3 is DEAD!	-1
Basically not much difference in this version or the PS2.  High sky-hook shots from the post is the biggest downfall.  Slow play on the advanced level makes a baller play on stater just for excitement.  NBA2K is much better becuase at least you get a few real game steals by jumpming, Live has none of that.  For true Vets, Live lost it when 2k hit the scene.  Don't get stuck with games like this, 100.	-1
Copy	-1
Golden Sun looks awesome.  It has great graphics and good control.  However, this was my first real RPG experience and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  There is SO MUCH dialog in this game that it lost my attention very quickly.  Just to get through the opening sequence takes about 40 minutes of dialog.  I keep hoping that I'll play and play some more and the dialog will get to a managable level, but it hasn't yet.  If you like to hear little squeaky fake voices and read LOTS of dialog, get this game.  If not, buy or wait for a not so RPGish game to come out...like The Legend of Zelda!	-1
UNSTABLE, GRAPHICS WOBBLY, GAME JUST OUTRIGHT STINKS	-1
I've reviewed and own over 30 PC games from the past year, all first person shooters. Let me tell you this has to be the worst of the worst that I've played. The graphics are pretty cool, but the game play is horrendous. It's extremely difficult, and my computer can barely keep up with the speed that it all moves at. Good idea, poor execution of that idea. The ONLY redeemable quality of this game is the price. I bought it when it was twice as much, which is why I was more disappointed. If your really bored, go for it, but Ghost Recon and Max Payne are only a few bucks more and are top FPS's. Good luck. For reference...I ran this game on a P 4 2.8ghz with 512 MB RDRAM and a Geforec 4 Ti 4600 and STILL had video lag. Did I mention Soldier of Fortune II?? Now THATS a shooter.	-1
Soldier of Fortune is a breakthrough of violence in the gaming world!  But that is all it is.  The game uses a heavily modified version of the quake 2 engine.  The characters look somewhat blocky.  The worst part of the game is that it is extremely repetitive.  You kill person after person after person, that's all you do.  By the end of the game you'll have killed over 1000 people.  The story wasn't worth telling, and the enemies never get exciting.  The difficulty settings were badly designed, luckily you can create a custom difficulty setting, which I reccomend. If you enjoy computer game violence this is for you.  You'll dissembody every conceiveable body part.  You'll here men screaming as their skin burns.  If you don't care what the violence in games looks like there are many other FPS's better than this.	-1
Wow what an unbelievably dull and boring game. I'm not gonna even go on to tell you how angry I was when I bought this game basing it off the information I received on the back that said its 'the best selling game in japan.' Thats funny considering (even for its time.) there were titan of a game titles like Final Fantasy. I have to admit I couldn't wait 4 or more hours just to get to a battle because the story is just so boring. I winded up looking on youtube to see how the battles looked and it actually looked like something even worse than the battles that can be made on RPG Maker for playstation (for those of you that played that game you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.) The towns were too cheesey and looked like there was absolutely no effort put into it at all. Just a warning. Do not buy this game. It is definately not worth the 50 bucks that people think its meant out to be.	-1
First let me say that i absolutely loved the first Dragon Warrior and the last, which is part 8. So why do i dislike part 7 so much? Oh, where to start?  First off, the graphics and sound are beyond terrible. Old school is one thing, but there is no need to make this game look and sound like an 8 bit title.  And the playable characters? What a sham!  Each of your 6 or so playable characters joins your party for no serious reason, tags along for 100 hours, and pretty much says 5 lines of dialogue in those 100 hours. Your characters have the personality of a wooden board.  And this game is unnecessarily huge. It took me about 75 painful hours to complete but couldve easily been reduced to 40 or so.  The reason is that you have to visit almost every single town, cave, maze, and dungeon twice! Going through every area 2-3 times is NOT fun and is repetitive beyond belief.  And yet another fabled aspect of this game is its huge assortment of playable job classes... yet they fail to mention that its broken.  There are dozens of classes that are worthless yet a couple that pretty much make the game a cakewalk, thus 'breaking' the game. Get yourself 3 Godhands, for ultima hit, and 1 teenidol, for hustle dance, and the entire game is yours to conquer.  This game never hit 'greatest hit' status in America and for good reason...	-1
REVIEWERS NOTE: Throughout this review the product is referred to as Dragon Quest VII and not Dragon Warrior VII.  They're both the same game, but the truth is: the series is called Dragon Quest.  So don't get confused.  I also refer to the other games in the series as Dragon Quest and not Dragon Warrior.  Dragon Quest is huge in Japan.  The games actually have to be release on Sundays or Holidays because of how big they are.  The Dragon Quest games are not nearly as big in America.  The other Dragon Quest games are actually a real treat--particularly the SNES games that never made it to the states.  Dragon Quest VII does not hit the height of the NES and SNES games in any way shape or form, mainly because this game in particularly, does nothing to actually make the Dragon Quest games mature, and that's really sad.  It's great that they got it together for Dragon Quest VIII, but it can't stop the seventh in the series from being the black sheep of them all.  It's really sad to because of all the Dragon Quest games, the seventh installment is one of the only ones to have a satisfying storyline where things actually progress and you don't spend a lot of time running around so lost you don't know what to do.  It's not a deep story by any means, but it does have more focus here than other Dragon Quest games.  Because of the structure of the story, there's not too much you can explore from the get go, and thus you're limited.  The first thing about Dragon Quest VII that people will note is that the game looks absolutely horrible.  For a late generation PSX game going up against the likes of Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX at the time, this game looks like a rejected Super Nintendo game, and it may be because it was originally in development for that particularly system.  The towns look really bad, the textures are mostly pixelated, the character sprites look horrendous.  Simply put, this is just a terrible looking game.  The sound effects are even worse.  You'll dread each time you have to pick up a barrel and toss it.  You'll dread opening a door.  The games framerate isn't even steady.  The only thing to the games graphical credit is that some of the enemies don't look so bad, and that it's colorful.  Still, even for those who don't base their judgment of a game on graphics will have to take a moment to get used to just how terrible they really are.  The second annoying thing is the menu system.  It's the exact same one that was used in Dragon Quest VI, and it's just a pain to navigate.  In a world where games like Final Fantasy VII made navigating the menu as easy chewing food, Dragon Quest VII makes it a tedious task.  Characters are limited to what they can hold and I don't want to go into the nightmare of equipping and re-equipping characters over and over again.  The menu interface is absolutely horrible.  It seems like such a dumb thing to complain about, but in an RPG released on the Playstation, inventory management shouldn't be so difficult, nor should I have to spend more time in the menu than actually exploring a dungeon.  Combat is also a big problem.  It's not that battling isn't fun.  Firstly, you don't get into a battle for quite some time.  In fact, you'll spend the first couple of hours of the game roaming around not battling anything.  It'll be a miracle if some gamers can even hold out that long.  Especially because it's an RPG with little story exposition in the beginning.  When you do make it to that point though, you'll be met with mixed feelings.  For some odd reason battling is fun, but again, the graphics really make you wonder sometimes.  The battle system is essentially the same as it was on the NES and SNES.  The problem here is simple: This isn't either of the two systems.  I don't mind the combat being menu based, but the fact that you don't see your characters and that they don't physically go up and strike the enemy makes battling feel a little... empty and uninspired.  Some of the enemies actually look pretty good, but I'm bothered that the battle engine is exactly the same as Dragon Quest I from way back when.  Dragon Quest VIII certainly did a far better job in at least making their battles look good.  Here, you just feel as if you're not involved enough.  It's simple, and it is fun because the combat is surprisingly deep and strategic.  Even better the game is a challenge.  But all the while you can't help but thinking you're playing an NES game on a system that is capable of so much more.  They say it'll take you about 100 hours to plow through Dragon Quest VII.  The game is, in fact, huge.  There's tons of sidequests, and just when you think the game is getting stale, they do manage to throw something else at you that gets a little more involved in the gameplay.  The job system, for instance, comes along hours after you've begun your quest, but it adds a lot of variety when it's finally added in there.  Enough to keep you busy for hours.  What a lot of people don't mention about Dragon Quest VII, however, is that a lot of those 100 hours are spent on heavily raising your party to getting better levels and stats.  Dragon Quest is known for making gamers work, and Dragon Quest VII actually does that.  For example, the game will not let you overpower your characters job classes.  There's a point where they do cut you off and you have to advance forward.  However, you've still go to worry about their normal levels, and you don't gain a whole lot of experience or gold from these monsters.  Thus, of the 100 spent to plow through the game, you'll more than likely spend more than 50 hours just leveling up to take on the next challenge.  And Dragon Quest VII is not an easy game.  While the sound effects are bad, the music of the game itself is quite good.  Dragon Quest has always had good music and Dragon Quest VII is no exception.  The game falls short in almost every category except music.  Here's where the game truly shines, and not only that but Dragon Quest fans will recognize some fantastic tunes from other games.  The bottom line is simple.  Is Dragon Quest VII a good game?  The answer is surprisingly, yes.  You just have to really be able to get passed the fact that you're playing an NES game on a system capable of so much more.  Simplicity has kept the series alive at least, but the game seriously looks like a rejected SNES title that they felt they needed to dress up in tattered clothes and shove onto the Playstation.  The game isn't bad, it's just that by the time Dragon Quest reached the seventh installment, one has to wonder why the developers didn't actually make it look or play like a Playstation RPG.  If you can look past the NES appeal, Dragon Quest VII is a great game.  It's fun to battle in (despite it's graphics).  There are tons of mini-games and sidequests to do, and there's so much variety that you'll want to play just for the sheer fact that you KNOW you haven't uncovered anything.  Still, the old school nature of this game is going to be hard to swallow, even for old school gamers.  The game is slow, the menu system is horrible, the graphics are subpar, the battles feel like you're doing nothing.  With these kinds of cons taunting the game, it's hard to recommend it even to die hard Dragon Quest fans.  Fun to play, but it's asking a lot gamers to look past its glaring shortcomings.	-1
It feels like a long RPG made by RPG maker.  Terrible graphics, music from 1991 and RPG maker style battle system with basicaly no story.  Not worth it.	-1
Bah, I found Dragon Warrior 7 seriously lacking in all aspects and wish I would have rented it Before I bought it. I stuck with it for about five or six hours, and when the game still failed to interest me, I gave up. The fighting is just as boring as the storyline, and the plot seems to fall out of no where into your lap with little explanation as to how the son of a fisherman would be best buds with the Prince. Furthermore, there's just no excuse for those horrible graphics, other then laziness. The cut scenes don't even have a small bit of sound, like walking or a rock slate being slid open. I'm all for games that focus on storyline before graphics, but this one dropped the ball in Both areas. This game seems to be one either you love or you hate, from the mix reviews I've seen, so I'd encourage you to try out a friends copy first unless you know and love the series.	-1
"Horrible game" is not enough to express how boring this game is. You can't see the characters when they fight, there is no visual flair to the spells, and the enemy movements are weak and minimal. Oh, and there is no actual plot, its non-linear. Too bad. I guess I'll go back to watching for the Dragonball Z game for GBA.	-1
Let's freely admit it.  Profess it!  THE FUTURE IS HERE!  Technical advancements are screening throughout the world, and not I`m not rambling about nanomachines or emigrational space travel, I`m aimed at the Gaming Industry (note the capitalization.  Oh yeah, it's that huge.)  Face it, the GBA -- in all its rights -- comprises extraordinary brilliance.  Many deemed Tekken's conversion on  the GBA to be an ungodly Fighter, and get this (you can bite down on your pillow now), they were absolutely, positively on que.  Bashed in it are horrendous moments of frustration.  Okay, so the greatest future isn't actually here, and by the effort of Namco, gaming is not at its finest. No, Tekken Advance is not a revival of the Tekken paradise, but it thrashes Mortal Kombat in every direction.  With GBA limitations, the leap from the massive 3D environments to 2D was Namco's hardship.  The GBA tries its best to capture the essence of Tekken and crashes.  Consisting of only 10 lousy fighters, the controls on each character have obviously been tweaked into a condensed format.  Single punch, kick, throw, and tag buttons are dished up on a skyrocketing discomfort level.  Because of the lost of the essential control scheme, the moves list was trimmed down to simplified, sluggish combos.  Worst, the AI is a recurring challenge and heavy with bevy combos.  Missing the intensity of a hardcore fighter, the repeated combo-jumble fighting proves to be nothing more than a disgrace. On a happier note (the reason for that extra star), the controls are extremely responsive and the directional pad is just as splendid, letting players easily walk, dart, hop, and backpedal.  On the whole the gameplay tries to deliver an adequate amount of mayhem.  Easily unraveled by the range of modes from previous installments, such as the Arcade, Survival, and Tag Battle, this repulsive remake deserves no credit, because this one was never meant to be. Graphically, Tekken Advance looks to be infected with a deadly case of visual disgust.  Look at this thing, it keeps a doleful cast of pre-rendered fighters who have faces of callousness.  The colorful backgrounds are ruined by jerky animation and smudged texturing.  Even when combos go a-thundering-in, the graphics transform into a squalid pigpen.  Tekken Advance, by screenshots, appeared to have taken complete usage of the GBA's full capacity, but is nowhere linked to the mighty emphasis of past games.  Tenements of the franchise strictly belong to the console market, and Namco falls extremely short to do justice on their handheld attempt.  Mark my words, 3D Fighters belong on specialized 3D formats -- otherwise known as the PS2, GameCube, or X-Box.	-1
DOOM probably had me hooked more than any other computer game; even Starcraft, Quake 3, etc. I still remember spending quite a bit of my computer time back in grade school blasting through Episode 3 Map 3 or Episode 2 Map 7, looking for different secrets and weapons. And when I wasn't doing that, I was happily playing multiplayer DOOM over the internet or downloading different "WAD" levels off various fansites. So when I finally decided to buy DOOM II, I was overjoyed to own what was supposedly an "improved" DOOM. I got the exact opposite... First the good. The graphics do look a bit cleaner and less pixelated than in the original DOOM. There are several new enemies at your disposal (the dreaded Arch Viles being possibly the worst, as in most annoying, to ever grace a computer game). There is a new weapon (the double-barreled shotgun). And the levels this time around are a bit larger and more complex. Sounds like an "improvement" so far (albeit, very small). So why exactly did I dislike DOOM II? The levels, while more complex, just aren't as well designed as they were in the original. They tend to get too maze-like in parts (more so than in DOOM 1), and the enemies seem like they were just randomly placed rather than thoughtfully put into certain parts of a level the way they were in the original DOOM (one minute you would be in a quite hallway, the next - CHOMP! a Bulldog Demon just came out of nowhere). Sadly, the best level in the game was IMO a bonus level titled Wolfenstein. It was sort of a remake of E1M1 from the original Wolfenstein 3D. Nazis, castle textures, and everything. But it's buried in a slew of horribly frustrating and/or boring levels like Suburbs and Circle Of Death (Lion King parody?), or possibly the worst experience I've ever had with an FPS - The Spirit World. Considering the fact that the "improvements" are so minor, do I even need to mention the game's feeling of "Been There, Done That"? So in brief, I'm afraid I just couldn't really get into DOOM II. ID Software foolishly opted not to release a Shareware demo for the game, which means you had to spend [money] to play it back in 1995. Disappointing, since that money would have been much better spent on games like Dark Forces or the original System Shock.	-1
Infograms should have stuck with Smugglers run. This thing is a sad attempt at making a game. If you want a REAL off road racing game, check out 4x4 Evo2 for X-box. At least that game is fun and has some life to it.	-1
I haven't written many reviews, so this is more of a ramble the a review. Oh well. Ugh. Thats all I have to say about this game. Ugh. Ok, that doesn't tell you very much, so I'll explain: This was gonna be my first MMORPG. I was going to get Anarchy Online, but the guys at the store suggested this instead, and having read good reviews, I got it. The only bigger mistake then buying it was losing the receipt so I couldn't return it. Gameplay: It starts out nice. You register, choose one of 3 realms(Avalon, the realm with Camelot, with a balance between magic and fighting, Midgar, the Norse , more fighting focused realm, and Hibernia, the Elven magic realm). You choose from one of 4 races depending on the realm, and then from one of 4 basic classes. After 5th level, you can choose one of the sub classes of the class you choose. So I signed on. I was completely overwhelmed with the controls, but the help system was good, and I picked it up fast. I went out and slayed monsters, leveled up, got a quest(Kill 5 of these monsters, bring back their skins). Well to make a long story short, thats the whole game. You walk around, you kill things with an overly simple combat system(It has some magic and skills, but its basically hit the combat button, let your character automatically fight, and throw in some skills). You maybe get a fetch and carry quest every once in a while. And thats not even starting on the fact that it takes half an hour to get between towns. I give this a 4. Graphics: Not bad. The textures are pretty good, though some things can be a little blocky, and have clipping problems. The animations are very smooth, and unique to each race and skill. I give this an 8. Sound: To be completely honest, I don't remember a thing about the sound. It is totally in one ear and out the other. It fits the game, and nothing more. I give this a 6. Value: The game isn't any fun, its currently $... in stores, and has a monthly fee(Between $... and $..., depending on how many months you sign up for). This game isn't any fun, so why would I pay a monthly fee for it? I give this a 2. Overall score(Not an average):4. I really wish I could give this a better score. I really do. But I can't. Because this was probably the most disapointing game ever, for me. I was looking forward to my first MMORPG- instead I got a 3D Diablo II with a more boring combat system and long walks. Oh well...There's always Planetside, or Neocron...	-1
Well to start with, I have a level 41 Paladin, and several other characters in the 30's, so that's where this point of view comes from.....now, on to the flaming. When you first start playing this game, and the world is new, it really seems like the holy grail of online RPGs.  The first 20 levels or so, new skills come fast, and the expierience treadmill is pretty easy to put up with.  There are also an abundunce of quests to do pre level 20 that actually give decent rewards, especially if you're playing your first character and have no cash/items to twink with.  The world looks nice, the character models aren't bad, not great, but not bad, all in all a pretty good looking game. Now warp to post level 20 play and the shallow nature of the game, and inherant problems start to loom larger and larger. Just because I like lists, I'll make one........ 1.  Quests/Kill tasks (good exp go find mob x and kill it sort of things) pretty much go away. 2.  The level treadmill starts tilting at a steeper incline. 3.  You begin to notice you don't get new abilites, just "version 2" of the spell or ability you got at level 5. 4.  Hmmmmmmm by this time you've probably run the length of the "realm" you're in, and the world is starting to get smaller. 5.  Content problems....there just aren't many places to go, and the places there are to go are small and overcrowded. Now let's warp to post 35ish play, and what is touted as one of the big features of DaoC.....Realm vs. realm combat!!!!! 1.  PvE content has become almost non existant...there is currently ONE dungeon you can go in, and everyone and their brother/sister is there.  (Next patch is adding "Epic Zones"... so we'll see). 2.  Realm vs realm (rvr from this point on) is HOPELESSLY imbalanced and just plain bugged.  I won't go into detail but there are some HUGE game stopping issues that don't seem to be getting fixed.  Also it's ENTIRELY based on level, and I mean that.  A level 43 chimpanzee banging on the keyboard, will defeat a level 41 highly skilled PvP player.  Level is EVERYTHING, and I mean everything in this game.  Player "skill" is non existant.  So ....back to the level treadmil...(see #1 and repeat this cycle). So that's the short list.....The PvE content is almost non existant, and the RvR combat that you've worked so hard to level for turns out to be one of the worst implementations of PvP in gaming history........not so hot. You'll love this game at first, I certainly did, but boy does it get old fast.  VERY short shelf life on this one, will be a blip in online history 5 years from now.	-1
This game in my opinion is terrible.  Though I must admit it did have probably the most stable MMORPG launch of all time, that still doesnt fix the actual problems with the game.  First off leveling in the game is rather easy, and I'm sure there already people that have achieved level 50.  Second, pvp is supposed to be a big deal in the game, but because the classes are so unbalanced it makes most pvp battles unfair.  The game also lacks in visual quality of the graphics.  Yes the graphics are nice, but they definitely do not compare to Anarchy Online's graphics.  This is just a wanna be Everquest, that failed in my opinion.  If you want a good MMORPG I suggest Anarchy Online or Everquest.	-1
This game is extremely boring. The graphics aren't really that great, there are practically no sounds, all you do is hit things with weapons and get their stuff and do it over again, I get no fun out of it whatsoever. This game would be nowhere without EQ(Do not think I am biased to EQ I do not play it) it basically got all its ideas from it and added a little more. To me, it is just a total EQ clone, it would have never been created without the thoughts and ideas EQ had. My advice if you don't like plain old ordinary RPG games like this one is to wait for shadowbane to come out.	-1
Didnt work	-1
it is the original and I guess if you were really interested it might almost be worth picking up out of a gutter to play but the elder scrolls saga has vastly improved in recent years.	-1
I am having problems getting it to play going to take it to gamestop to see if they can tell me what the problem is don't know if it was a problem that the store knew about and didn't care or if it was something that happened in delivery but it won't play and as of now a waste of money	-1
After having watched many gameplays of both this, and the Skyrim adaption of this series.. I thought "What could go wrong?" I broke out the old xbox system, bought this and fired it up. Let me first say I love first person type of games. This, however.. left a lot to be desired. Okay, it's a pretty old game.. I'll try Skyrim. Not impressed with it either. I'm just not a fan of the Elder Scroll series.	-1
FIrst off, the game itself is great, but not good enough to warrant purchasing the Xbox version, after hours of play the game will crash continually until the point you can't move through certain citys without it locking up and you haven't to wait through extremely long load times to get back.  Do yourslef a favor and pick up the pc version instead. This is not issue just experienced by me, apparantly the xbox runs out of memory and when loading a new area the game locks up taking forever, however if you don't beat everything and constantly make new characters you shouldn't run into problems. Play at your own risk.	-1
While I have never enjoyed overly linear games (ie Legends of Dragoon for PS1) I can't imagine how one stays interested in such an open-ended and bland game- Ok, OK sometimes it is fun just to roam but I feel like I'm in the Sahara without a compass when I'm playing the game.  No doubt that the graphics are beautiful but the story is basically nonexistent, the whole game is just a thousand side quests- no exaggeration.  Such great potential for interaction exists but there are no characters that you develop interesting relationships with- you just make friends or make enemies and later they forget if they've even met you!  Plus, the game is either way too easy or WAY too tedious- tons of big weapons and tons of annoying and boring enemies.  The battle system is just sitting there hitting the swing button, seriously!, besides some use of magic it's like a bad baseball game.  PLUS, THE WORST is the crashing of the game, I'm far along (though I only play because I hate not finishing a game) and this thing crashes a lot.  Someone should sue the maker for such shoddy production. IF YOU OWN ANY OTHER SYSTEM BUY ANY OTHER RPG- it is not even worth the $20 price.  If you only have an XBOX and want an RPG you are...umm, to put it politely, out of luck. (Which is sad- I own a PS2 and my roommate owns an XBOX and I think the XBOX would be the better system if they made anything except Halo copies)	-1
Ideally, I think the perfect adventure gaming experience is an environment practically as diverse as reality, while far more fantastical and allowing the stretching of a logical framework that is the bread and butter of our daily life.  This may be a technological impossibility but it does lead to some interesting contrasts with the constant appeal of occult and religious beliefs.  Maybe satisfying gaming is a substitute for the same...but in continuing the analogy, that means Morrowind is a poor illusion.  It aims for what we want in a good RPG, a departure from a tightly scripted path that is the only flaw in a far superior game like Final Fantasy.  It tries to do though what it can't pull off, and the end result is more tedious and mundane than liberating.  Yes, there is a lot you can do, and you can do it usually when you'd like, but it isn't much fun which makes me wonder if the true scriptless RPG will ever be here on the console.  Maybe a fantastical story does need plot, more like a novel than a life.  Add the narrative flaw to a poor combat system and XBOX still doesn't have a great RPG, though more efforts are on the way.  Wait for them.	-1
The biggest problem with this game: it can create problems with your Xbox!  Apparently, it saves progress in such a way that it can start to crash frequently.  I've read some online stories of people who have had to have their Xbox repaired after using this, so be careful. The other downside is that it is just plain boring.  You can walk and walk and walk with little action. In it's defense, it is the only game I've seen with such a big and open-ended world.  There is simply a huge amount of terrain you can wander around, with a huge amount of freedom to do whatever you want (kill monsters, steal stuff, find food, buy things...)	-1
Unfortunately, that's not very long.  A splendid game made all but unplayable by bugs and crashes.  Get the PC version.	-1
Perhaps my attention span is shriveling up from the action genre of pc games, but I just couldn't sit still for this game.  This could be a fabulous game playing experience, but I'll never know.  I couldn't get through the first boring hour in Morrowind.  Can my character move ANY slower??  I ran everywhere, then had to stop to restore fatigue.  This may indeed be the gaming experience of someone's life, and the storyline, open ended gameplay and graphics do suggest that.  I just think I have been forever spoiled by the likes of more exciting games, like NOLF, System Shock 2, Deus Ex, TR, Thief, Half-life, Unreal, AvP, etc.  If I wanted mellow, I'd read a book.	-1
In a previous review of this product, I railed against what I thought was a bit of a lie on the part of the manufacturer.  Hailed throughout the industry as a model of open-ended play, MORROWIND, I thought, had a surprisingly linear ending.  That being a fairly important issue, I decided to devote a whole review to it.  But there's more to Bethesda's new baby. Or, rather, there's more to warn you about. If you like quests, you'll love the core game play itself.  But soon enough, I think, you'll find many of these quests so much busywork.  Worse, some of them paint inconsistent pictures of the characters you meet:  one minute they behave as benefactors, the next they're basically asking you to steal or murder.  Truth is, there's not a lot of plot-driven logic to most of these quests.  While they do gradually reveal the mystery of the Main Quest to your character --in a more-or-less satisfying way--they don't particularly make sense from the perspective of the characters that order you around.  Take the Mage's Guild as an example.  According to the rules of the Guild, you're not supposed to steal from a fellow Mage.  But several quests revolve around you doing just that.  You fail the quest, and get kicked out of the Guild, if the theft occurs in plain sight.  But if you carry it out covertly, you're golden.  Theft only matters, it seems, if others are watching. If you're into exploring the world of a game, MORROWIND does a better job than just about any game out there of letting you go anywhere, and rewarding you for your curiosity.  You'll love finding little towns and all the small stories happening against the backdrop of the overarching "Main Quest".  You'll probably be amazed the first time you see day dusk into night, or the way rain grows from a sprinkle to a thunderous downpour.  The weather/time module is probably the most advanced on the market, and you'll simply marvel at how precisely the developers have caught the sun's progress over the course of a day.  Indeed, this, more than any other aspect, is probably what will keep you playing.  But all this is not without its price.  The extreme intricacy of the environment, combined with the detailed growth your character is undergoing leads to a very buggy game.  It's just too much stuff, somehow.  I've never had a game that so regularly crashes my Xbox.  Yeah.  You heard that right:  CRASHES.  This game does everything from completely freezing up during an intense fight, to stopping in the middle of saving a game (ouch!), to randomly bouncing back to the opening Xbox title screen.  There is, it seems, a price for being the most ambitious title ever released. And you get charged that price not only in crashes, but in errors throughout.  Here's a partial list of bugs I've encountered: * Spelling errors everywhere.  This game relies on text.  The developers should've relied on a spell checking program and several copy editors. * Movement errors at random times.  My character gets stuck all the time.  That is, she behaves as if there's something blocking her progress.  When I switch to the third-person perspective, it's obvious there's nothing that should be holding her up.  She's just "stuck", and the only solution is re-loading the last saved game.  Items magically duplicate themselves in your inventory.  The best/worst example of this is with some of the items that make potions.  I had a particularly expensive item that would grow every time I selected it.  At last count I had over 100 of these items in my inventory, and there's no sign that the bug has an upper limit.  Since these items are worth about 4000 gold each, I've basically found an endless supply of money, thereby "crashing" the economy of the game. * A hopelessly disorganized inventory.  Once you get to the point you can carry, say, hundreds of potions, you'll know how frustrating it is to try to find one of them.  They're not alphabetized.  They're not sortable according to any quality.  They're just in the order they're in.  Trying to find a potion can break the flow of an otherwise adrenaline-rushing fight. * Framerate sometimes sucks.  Oh how it sucks.  Get into a fight with multiple magic-casters and you'll see what I mean.  Even on the Xbox, which can handle complex fights well, MORROWIND can sometimes unintentionally slip into serious slo-mo. Bottom line:  don't buy this version of the game thinking you're going to escape the bugs that are rampant in the PC version.  It's buggy, regardless of platform. But  the game's biggest failing, to me, is the inability to play more than one character  at a time.  I'm not really talking about the lack of multiplayer.  No, I mean that you can't have more than one player in any one game state.  Many other RPGs allow you exit one character and bring up another in the same game state, allowing you to experiment with different character types without losing your basic progress towards the accomplishment of the game's goals.  Here, once you've picked your character, you have to play it to the end.  Given the length of time it takes to finish this game, most people will,  therefore, only scratch the surface of game play.  If you find, midway through the game, that you'd like to switch from being a hack-and-slash barbarian to a potion-making magic user, you're out of luck.  You'd actually have to start a brand new game to do so.  And most people just don't have the TIME to start over. In sum, then, MORROWIND is a fascinating, if deeply flawed, title.  I so desperately want to like it that I've written two reviews of it.  But at the end of the day I feel like I've just wasted more time than I've enjoyed.  At most, it's worth renting for a week to see what all the fuss is about.	-1
Man, i was really wanting to play this game for a long time. I thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome. But then i played the game and realized i am way too stupid for it. Yeah, i didn't know what i was doin. I figure that too enoy this game youve gotta be some kinda hardest of hardcore rpg player that understands this stuff. An average person will get confused to death by this. A lot of people have a different view and know exactly what they are doing, they are who this game is for. Newbies, step away, far away.	-1
I waited for months for this game to come out and when i actually got it I almost threw up at the poor graphics and the awful voice acting. the story can't be that great but I would not know as I sold it after playing it for ten minutes. There are not 300 job classes you can make your own however. I really doubt anyone who hadn't played the pc version was expecting this! and afterplaying this you will realize that it is all hype! RENT IT if you are really interested!	-1
After playing this game for 5 days, I feel that it is not as good as it first looks. The grpahics are nice, but not sectacular. The Flight controls could be better. The enemies at times are super tough. This can be very frustrating. If you find yourself easily annoyed at doing the same mission over and over till you get it right then avoid this game like the plague. There were a couple of good chopper games out on the old Psx. But none have really made a definitive chopper game. Hope springs eternal though.   If you want a flight game game Ace combat 4 a go.	-1
Not going to lie I was not a fan at all. Its like weird resident evil type play but so much harder to follow the story or even know what you should even be doing half of the time.	-1
Game was badly scratched, defective product	-1
THPS is so much fun, and it has infinate replay value, so this should too, right?  Sadly, no.  Only 2 tricks are customizeable, but that's not the problem.  No one has ever heard of any of the guys, except maybe the "Slim Jim" mascot, but characters' names don't matter, either.  So what is the problem?  SPEED.  Think about it, in THPS, you start out fast, you recover fast, and you never really slow down.  In this, you go slow until you hit a hill, take 20 minutes to get up, and once you stop--you take your sweet time speeding up again.  (Ever ride an actual single-speed bike? Hard to pedal, right?  Espescially up hills.  Same here, you pedal like crazy and go nowhere. [But you get there fast!])  Seriously, pre-order THPS3 and steer clear of this.	-1
Originally penciled in as a late addition to the N64's library, Eternal Darkness was eventually shifted over to the freshly born GC, where it was meant to be the first of many mature-themed first party titles brought to the system. Looking back over the years that have come and gone since, that string of adult-leaning N-published games never really came to be, and the Cube faltered in a similar fashion to its immediate predecessor. But this is now, and for Darkness, that was then. The birth of a new console meant an opportunity for a clean slate and instant anticipation.  The storyline revolves around a blonde-haired, blue eyed, athletic woman named Alexandra Roivas. Constantly haunted by dreams of the undead, she's awakened late one night by a telephone call that informs her of her grandfather's brutal, untimely demise. As the man's only living relative, she's asked to meet with police about the situation, and quickly finds herself drawn into the web of magick, satanism and otherworldly struggles that had defined her late relative's life. The entire story effectively transpires on the grounds of the old man's mansion, which isn't nearly as dull and repetitive as you'd think, thanks to the inclusion of a single intuitive plot device. Hidden among her deceased patriarch's things, Alexandra discovers the necronomicon, a book bound in human flesh that holds the secrets of her family's legacy and the majority of the game's variety. Most of the book's pages have been torn out and scattered throughout the mansion, naturally, but upon discovering a new chapter, Alexandra will dive right in - somewhat literally. Each new set of pages tells the story of a different character and his or her interactions with the book itself, and as Alexandra reads, you'll take control of that character, playing your way through their tale. As such, Eternal Darkness feels more like a series of intertwined short stories than a single, game-spanning epic... a welcome change of pace . What's more, it allows players to travel unbound throughout time and space, adventuring through a roman war expedition one chapter, conquering an Indiana Jones style aztec temple the next, without the need for a silly, out-of-place object like a time machine (or worse).  Truly, there are a lot of really good ideas at play here. I loved the idea of playing the role of an 18th century noble with medical aspirations, performing rudimentary autopsies on the bodies of demons after a battle. The suggestion of a steep tower of corpses, a sacrifice to an ancient, forgotten god, is an amazing mental image. Even the continued use of the book itself as a means to explain Alexandra's growth as a character and a magician was extremely well-concepted. Upon reading in explicit detail about a distant relative's discovery of a magical spell, it's only natural to assume she'd have a fairly good understanding of how to go about casting it herself. Imagination most definitely isn't the weak spot in Sanity's Requiem; it's the execution and realization of those ideas that bothers me.  Take the system of magic, for example, what should've been one of the most important aspects of the game. The idea is that there are three distinct pools of magical energy, a red pool, a green pool, and a blue pool, that simultaneously have power over one color while falling victim to the other. Green is stronger than red, for instance, while blue overcome green, and red conquers blue. It's a brilliantly simple idea, but one that falls flat due to being underexplained and overly detailed. You'll know that the boss you're fighting is using a green special attack, and that you should be counterattacking with a blue assault, but exactly which spell you should be using is only revealed through an abysmal series of trial-and-error kamikaze strikes. Even then, half the time you aren't casting at the right time, or you're not standing in the right place, or the boss has shifted to another form. If I had a dime for every time I had to resort to an online FAQ after reaching the point of frustration during this game, I'd be able to buy a replacement copy and hurl the original into the wall, frisbee style, as stress relief.  It's this maddening sense of frustration and helplessness that really strikes the most damning blow to my overall opinion of the game. After a half-dozen hours or so of gameplay, you'll be so utterly defeated and annoyed that your motivation to continue will begin to pay a heavy toll. As Alexandra learns more and more about what's going on with her heritage and what was really behind her grandfather's murder, you'll find yourself actually comprehending less and less. It's a problem I had with what was formerly one of my favorite comic books, Hellblazer, a year or two ago: because the story is supernatural and underworldly in setting, the writer(s) assume that the solutions to problems don't necessarily need to make sense, so long as they sound spooky and look cool.  Much of the gameplay is in keeping with that same ongoing trend: stupendous ideas, lame execution. Probably the most unique element of the game is its "fright meter," which slowly drains as the on-screen individual sees freakier and freakier things. I know I'd be a little weirded out if a rotting hunk of meat and bones suddenly climbed out of the wall and started lurching toward me... we're conditioned to expect our heroes to immediately continue their quest without missing a beat, so it adds a new dimension to the proceedings when you realize that video game characters can get scared, too. If your fright meter gets too low, you'll even start to experience some hallucinations and so-called "horror effects," which are a real blast and range from the minute to the absurdly out of place. Sometimes you'll see something moving in the corner of the room, other times you'll actually foresee your own death, but the hallucinations will always subside at some point. They don't move the plot along, like the amusing asides in the original Metal Gear Solid did, and only seem to exist to provide a few extra "holy crap" heart-skipping moments. Which is par for the course with a horror game, I'll concede.  Gameplay in general is fairly slow-paced and monotonous, with few action-heavy sequences and a whole lot of aimless wandering and exploring. Even the boss battles are usually relegated to long sessions of striking, wandering around avoiding attacks for a few minutes, and then striking again... like a hilariously slow chase scene. For a game that's so overflowing with narrow corridors, doorways and exquisite surroundings, you'd think that collision detection with the walls wouldn't be such a handicap, but in Darkness it quickly becomes your worst enemy. If your weapon should happen to strike a wall in mid swing, your character will immediately halt their attack and stumble backwards for a few moments, giving your enemies all the time they need to tear you to pieces. Attempting to fight a single enemy in a hallway is often like threading a needle: you'll miss half a dozen times before you get it right.  In the same vein as the Resident Evil series, the teenaged bonding moments that are used to fill out a blockbuster horror film are replaced here with a series of riddles, puzzles and tricks. I expected as much, but couldn't have anticipated how easy and linear most of Darkness's riddles really are. With only a few exceptions, every item is miraculously found just before it's needed, to the point that the pieces basically solve the game's problems for you. If you find a statue, chances are good you'll find a peculiar, statue-shaped hole in the next room.  Eternal Darkness' visuals have aged even worse than the rest of the title, and I'm not entirely sure they were ever really up to snuff. Sure, there's always the argument that these graphics were "stunning when they first came out," but I didn't play this game when it was first released, and even though it's just four years old, today they look extremely shoddy. Human skin textures are particularly bad and lumpy, but even the environments and items suffer from weak textures and a ragged, blocky basic structure. The one exception to this rule is with the creatures themselves, which are all brilliantly designed and extremely well-executed. I'd compare the lot of them to most of the bad guys in Silent Hill and perhaps the most gruesome baddies of Resident Evil. It hurts just to look at most of these guys, the way their flesh seems to stretch and strain to withhold the ugliness that's going on underneath. The only thing I could wish for there is a wider taste of variety, since the rogue's list seen here is extremely shallow.  Considering all that came before it, Darkness' audio is surprisingly well done. The Cube does everything in its power to deliver a solid surround-sound experience, and those effects come as close to accomplishing the spooky vibe these developers were obviously shooting for as any other aspect of the game.  Musically, the game's soundtrack is uneventful. It swells and sways as necessary, and occasionally gives a nice bit of mood to a location. It isn't repetitious, which is probably my greatest pet peeve about in-game music, and it doesn't get in the way, but it also doesn't stand out on its own. Let's put it this way: I wouldn't rush out to the stores to buy Eternal Darkness: The Original Symphonic Score. The voice acting in general is very good, with few exceptions, and though the dialog the actors are asked to deliver is usually stilted and unbelievable, they go beyond the call of duty to give their roles a personality and motivation that was sorely lacking in the script. Especially good are the noises, shallow screams and ambient ticks of the insanity effects, and each character's resulting reaction to them. While the same phrase is sometimes repeated at the conclusion of one of these sequences, it's not something that ever really bothered me and actually took steps to reveal the characters as more honest and true to life. If you're freaked out and seeing things in an unfamiliar mansion, I doubt the first thing to enter your mind is "come on, let's at least get a little variety into the dialog." You're going to scream the first thing that comes into your head, whether you've said it before or not.  To summarize, this feels like a series of very good concepts that were just drawn too thin, which is odd because the game itself, clocking in around twelve hours, is fairly short. There were so many superb, imaginative concepts that died on the way to the screen here that it really became something of a sad theme for the whole picture. Whether it was the truly surprising insanity effects, the unique limb-targeting system or the original system of magic, no matter how good the idea, the execution was always killing the potential for me. Despite the lingering offering of replay value here (there's supposedly a super secret ending if you finish all three potential paths) I just didn't find myself motivated to go through it all again, especially considering how slow, plodding and ultimately dreary the majority of the actual gameplay was. Considering the amount of people that had pimped this game to me, and the incredible reputation it seems to have gathered in the years since, I found myself more than just a little disappointed. As a "must-have" title for the GameCube, Eternal Darkness is nothing but a major league let-down.	-1
In Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, A man from ancient times, Pious Augustus, has taken control of a terrible force and you play through a series of tasks as different characters that will eventually lead you to stopping Augustus from summoning the evil force that will eventually lead to the world's doom. There are three different ways to go about this game, depending on which artifact Pious Augustus chooses. This means that you will have to go through what is basically the same storyline three times. The lack of difference in the three paths makes the game rather boring; the only differences are what enemies you run into, the order in which you get the red, green, and blue runes, and slight differences in what the characters talk about. Everything else (the traps, the puzzles, etc.) is exactly the same in all three paths. You even go through all of the same stages, in the same order! "yawn" Boring. The gameplay time is very short; it takes only 10-20 hours to go through the storyline one time. And it get shorter everytime since you will most likely remember what you have to do to get to the next situation. Also, none of the enemies are all that difficult to get past. You almost never have to ration your ammunition for guns; ammunition is too abundant. The only thing you get for completing the game through all three paths is a cutscene. I was expecting to have access to the "purple artifact story" (if you actually play this game, you will know what I am talking about). In fact, the cutscene leads you to believe that you will gain access to the "purple artifact story". What a big disappointment...	-1
First of all this game is way too hard(on the 3rd leverl for godssakes) and you don't care whether the character lives or dies. I like games that are challenging like Zelda and Metroid but to have something be really difficult on the 3rd level is just ridiculous. Youre much better off with Resident Evil if you want a good game that is rated M.Im so glad I rented this thing instead of bought it. I already want to return it its so horrible.	-1
Was really hoping to play it but will not play and it isn't in English	-1
o.k. its called blood wake wheres the blood and a 7 yr old could beat this game easily I should know I watched one play this game sucks	-1
This is the absolute worst game i have ever played.   Pros 1. Nice water graphics   Cons 1. Bullets are tiny and orange so you can't tell if you shot or not 2. All you do is shoot stuff 3. It takes a million shots to kill another boat 4. It's just plain boring   Note: DONT play this game! Do yourself a favor and stay far far away!	-1
This game is disappointing because the graphics are sooo blurrrry, if it was sharper and more detailed graphics it might be enjoyable, but,it is not. I bought these games, need for speed underground, and underground 2 because I wanted to play race games on gamecube, as there were very few available for game cube. I have played midnight club race games on ps2 and these are much better choices than need for speed games.	-1
I rented this game to play with my girlfriend.  After watching the uninspiring cut scenes, which could have been done on a Super NES, we were ready for the boating action.  Unfortunately the deathmatch and storyline games are both so bleak and repetitive this game would qualify as the first shareware Xbox game, except it costs as much as a quality game like Halo.  After a few games, I returned it straight to Blockbuster, even though there were still three days left on the rental.  I'm really glad I bought SSX Tricky just after I rented Blood Wake.	-1
At first i was looking forward for this game ' but when i got it i was disapointed heres why  Pros  Sound 0/10 terrible music sound terrible voice acting (e gadd's voice)  Gameplay 0/10 the levels are very hard and confusing  Controls 0/10 they are difficult to use when you are trying to suck up the ghost in that vaccum  But if you're a fan of challange then this is the game for you ; but if you cant stand the frausration then you know what i meant by my review	-1
This game doesn't compare to the other Mario games. Although the story sounds cool, there just isn't much exitement in sucking up ghosts with a vacuum cleaner. It's very monotonous; there aren't really any different places to go and although the ghosts vary in color and shape, they all basically work the same. It's more frustrating than challenging. I don't know - the areas and ghost-sucking may not bore you like it bored me. Perhaps one of the few good sides to this game is that it's interesting and unique. But the game play is definatly missing something. Koopas maybe.	-1
Luigi's Mansion is a definite no-no!  The controls on the game [are weak], it is completely boring, and the storyline is too original.  When Luigi enters the mansion, it's nothing but cleaning a dusty old house!  This game is very boring because there is nothing to do on it...	-1
I skipped renting or owning this game because it's only an hour long.  I did not like what I saw when I played it in store, so I decided to never play the game again.  Overall, it's just not Nintendo's best effort and is clearly a launch title that was rushed in the end so it could drop in stores the day the system did.	-1
I don't have this game, i only played it at a few stores. I beat a couple bosses and got bored of it right after that. I would expect this game to have come out on the NES and it still would have been a bad game. the plot is boring and repetative, and there aren't any twists to the story - suck up a ghost, beat up a boss ghost, suck up more, beat up another boss ghost...Plus, it's a lot like Blinx: The Time Sweeper (Xbox) and that's a way better game.	-1
I hope it's not a sign of Nintendo products to come. It's very short, at 5 hours, for a game that cost something like 70 dollars Canadian when it first hit, consumers deserve more, with the lack of replayability, this game is about 10+ bucks per hour (when you'll likely play just once). Resident Evil 1 however, also could be beaten in a mere 5 hours (that info SHOULD be printed on the box). Maybe, like Dreamcast, this game will hit 5 dollars sometime, then I'll probably pick it up, because even though it has these problems, part of me wants to rent it again. Maybe it's for the cheesey fun, or for looks, but I thought about it. There should have been a few better modes after beating the game, some mini-games for 4 players or a creative vacuum deathmatch to spruce things up, levels could've been rearranged. This game feels like one level out of what should have been about a 5-7 level game, and the plot is simple, too. I wish he had put that vacuum away at least once!	-1
As a long time fan of the Super Mario series, I have seldom, if ever, been disappointed by any games in the entire series, from Donkey Kong (and I do mean the original arcade game that started it all) all the way to Super Mario 64. Given Nintendo's track record with this series and the absolute high quality of games for its new GameCube platform, I had every reason to think that "Luigi's Mansion", even if it was not up to the level of its predecessors, would be a quality entry in the series. I have to say that I was sorely disappointed.  I have a certain level of tolerance for games, even ones that are frustratingly slow and plodding, but I ran out of patience with this game. I could barely even get into playing it. From the very beginning, this game gets annoying. When Luigi first enters the mansion, he encounters this stupid little professor who is supposedly there to give Luigi the background of what is happening in the mansion and teach him to use this vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts that haunt the mansion. Yet, the idiotic professor rambles for about 10 minutes worth of dialogue and THERE IS NO WAY TO BYPASS IT!! After each brief piece of dialogue, you have to hit a button to make it continue, too. So you just can't do something else while he rambles. But, I digress. You would think that once you get past that annoyance, you could just get right into the game. WRONG! Learning to use the vacuum cleaner is incredibly aggravating. The game doesn't give you any chance to develop a feel or flow for how to use it because every time you do anything with it THAT STUPID PROFESSOR STARTS YAPPING AGAIN!!! This, alone, caused me to put the game aside for about 8 months before trying it again. Once I finally exerted enough patience to get past this madness, I figured I would finally be able get into the game. Once again, I was wrong. I find that almost every door is locked and any method of getting through those doors is hidden somewhere on the board. I had the strategy guide and could very well have looked up how to open these locked doors, but at this point, I was just too frustrated to care anymore. I put the game down for the last time...	-1
Luigi's mansion is one of the Gamecube Oldies. Most everyone who ended up reserving a Gamecube reserved Luigi's Mansion as well. Oops. Luigi's mansion is so incredibly... what's the word... oh yeah, STUPID. You start out with a plot line that you have won a haunted mansion in a contest you never entered. You encounter a ghost, and some crazy guy sucks it up with a poltergust 3000 (a vacume cleaner) You then must rescue Mario from the mansion, and thats when it gets exciting... for the one time. Whats the gameplay like? Well, you need to suck up ghosts. First you need to shine a light on them to freeze them, then press L and pull back on the control stick to suck them up. But the drop bombs down, and you go into them, and you lose health and the ghosts! It's [horrible] how you cannot control the way you go. Second, more ghosts pop out and hurt you, and you can't do anything about that either! You would not beleive how stupid the entire thing is. The entire game revolves around pressing L and holding the C-stick down. Short "mini" games involve you the size of a peanut againts ghosts 50x your size. Also, during gameplay, the dumbest things let you get furthur. What does sucking in a peice of paper have to do with letting 50 boo's come out of a sewer? Speaking of boo's, you need to capture 50 of them. They are virtually all the same, and by ghost 10, you are saying "What's the point of this?" They travel through the walls and you need to capture them by going into a different room! Once I was stuck for 10 minutes in a hallway chasing a boo from room to room. BOOOOORING. You also lose health for opening doors, having mice touch you, and you virtually are dead after 10 touches by a ghosts, plus -20 everytime it shoots out a bomb at you. The gameplay gets a 5/10. Now, I know, I sound like the old men from [a t.v. show], complaining about everything, but I can't complain about this. Despite the ...awful gameplay, the graphics will blow you away. Everything is in 3D and makes it look great. Ghosts have perfect transparentry, and the physics are perfect. If you try to suck up a cloth, it will respond to how hard you pressing the button, where you are, and how much your moving back. It's amazing. The graphics get a 10/10, but don't count on it to help this game's grade. The sound is neutral. I can't complain, but I can't praise. The ghosts basically all make the same chattery laughter, and the boo's have the exact safe sfx for all of them. The sound gets a 7/10, but I'm being generous to the fact that it was one of the first games from Gamecube. Speed's ok. It's not like Madden 2002, thank god, but it's superfast. There is loading time, but it's not annoyingly slow. Speed gets a 8/10. Controls are decent, except for one part. The y button helps you see what can kill a ghost, but it's so slow by the time you know what it is, it bumps into you and you lose major health. You also have to pull the control stick in the opposite direction, which is very difficult because it seems to change while you are holding it. You will know what I mean if you foolishly purchase this game. Controls get a 8.5/10 Whats this "replay value" you speak of? L's Mansion has NO replay value. Whats the point of doing it again? It's gonna be exactly the same everytime! I'm not joking when I give the replay value a 1/10. You beat it, end of story. What's more to do? Basically, if you want a game that will frustrate and waste your time and your hard-earned [$$], buy Luigi's Mansion. Case closed. Let's review: Gameplay: 5/10 Graphics: 10/10 Sound: 7/10 Speed: 8/10 Controls: 8.5/10 Replay value: 1/10 Total: 39.5/60 giving Luigi's Mansion a 65.83, my lowest review ever. Am I forgetting something? Oh yeah! I always add points for cheats on games. Right, so now instead of a 65.83, I'm gonna give it the appropriate amount of points for cheats, leaving Luigi's Mansion new total to be... 65.83! Woohoo!	-1
Horrible will never buy from this seller again	-1
Microsoft's Amped is a mediocre game, with flawed physics and awkward controls. The gameplay is centered around being free to go anywhere you please, but I never truly felt free at all. Though you are able to ride around everywhere, I still felt that I was set on a predetermined path and trying to change course was more difficult than it should have been. The controls for doing grabs are mapped out onto the right thumb-pad, leading to unneeded falls. The trick system is very basic and every character has the exact same grabs and tricks. The trick system feels extremely linear and leaves no room for experimentation. When I first bought Amped, I was expecting a snowboarding game based on realism, but I soon found out that Amped is NOT realistic at all and SSX Tricky, also on X-Box, is easily a much better game. Though not bad, Amped cannot contend with games like SSX Tricky on the market. Amped should be sitting in a bargain bin instead of in a gamer's collection.	-1
The Graphics are are worse than N64.  The game is boring beyond anything I've ever played.  The controls don't make any sense.  Highly recommend buying something else.	-1
Had to return. Game kept gliching.	-1
...This game is absolutely horrible.  The playabilty is poor and the graphics are barely mediocre.  Don't waste your money ...	-1
When ghost recon came out they said Tom Clancy was going for a more tactical type game. I immediately invisioned myself leading a big, maybe even huge, team of soldiers. Instead I got a game pretty much like the old, and originally fun but now boring, Rainbow Six games. It's exactly like Rainbow six escept outdoors and with less soldiers and less choice of equipment. You have three teams. Alpha team can have 3 soldiers on it, Bravo 2, and Charlie only 1. Making it very like the Rainbow Six games except worse. The good points are the good graphics of the soldiers however. Thier guns are very well put together graphicaly, and the suits for the snipers have nice camoflauge aspects to them. The scenery is rather nice too, very realistic are the trees and bushes and sound effects and such. However, putting on night vision turns the scenery a bit too game-like. It falls short in terms of weapon realism too. There is no kick (Recoil) for any of the  weapons, making it very much like a poorly designed FPS game. The scenarios are nicely designed. with realistic objectives and good maps. However with the small team you have these maps are more of a curse then a blessing. Multiplayer on these maps is much, MUCH, more fun. Another thing I wish they'd implemented was the ability to play as a regular soldier. Not having to command anyone or anything, just to follow along with the mission plan. Having to monitor everyone and move them along with you took a big fun factor out of the game. The Firefight single mission types and such did keep the game going for me when I got bored of the regular campaign though. Upside: Good scenery, player models, and gun graphics. Several different single player game types. Good mulitplayer action. Downside: Not too realistic, no recoil with weapons etc. Can only take six soldiers max on a mission. Always the leader, can't ever be a grunt. Limited equipment selection.	-1
What can I say? This game is boring. Yeah that sounds right, Childish? Very much so. Balenced TOO well!?! Yes. Very much so. "Luigi's Mansion" plays out like this (In all the same order): Go into a room. Suck up gousts into your vacume cleaner (???). Find the key. Go unlock the next room. Repeat. Now go directly to jail. Do not pass GO. Do not collect $200 dollers. Even though $200 will buy you your Gamecube, this game will not take off your ming off the spent money with entertainment. Honestly, I can't come up with any reason why anyone would want to spend 6 hours sucking up gousts and then not play the game again! There is no real ending, and the game ends once you figure out that the game is getting boring. Rent only. Unless your of the hardcore type and must own EVERYTHING that is Mario!	-1
Got this game for me and my nephew, but we couldn't install it on Windows 8. I got it to run by running xp in a virtual desktop and it worked fine.  However, no matter what type of compliance we ran in W8 it just wouldn't even install, but it wasn't meant to I don't guess...no big deal though...I just need to read before jumping on to buy next time. Someone else mentioned it in comments...so now I am a commenter fan.	-1
I could not get this game to install on my windows 7 computer.  Check different websites and different forums and I just did not want to jump through hoops just to get a game to play and relax with.  So I will try the IL-2 1946 game and see if it will work, if not I will return it .	-1
I have all the rainbow six games, and I think this is a stumbling attempt to create a battlefiel war game. I think it was stupid of Ubi and Red Storm to put somthing this pitiful out there with operation flashpoint out... Its good if you like the rainbow six series, but if you want somthing a little better, go for operation flashpoint.	-1
I've tried this game a number of times, but the most exciting thing I've done so far is crash.  I diligently follow all the headings and altitudes but never seem to be able to find the enemy.  So I just fly, and fly and fly, look at the clouds, get tired of it and quit the game.  What game?  I am looking forward to Combat Flight Simulator 3.	-1
was so scratched I'm surprised it worked	-1
This stupid thing was my only way to get wireless connection on my xbox 360 in the beginning. It was a hack to install and eventually it became unusable but damn microsoft for not building in WIFI.	-1
Unless you are using the obsolete WEP encryption standard, this won't work on your network.  There is no firmware update available to make it so that it is compatible with WPA or WPA2 without completely removing its ability to work with the 360.  So unless you are willing to switch your network to WEP encryption (a decision which depends on how paranoid you are for the most part), then you will have to purchase the one made by Microsoft or route your 360 through your laptop or PC (which is fairly easy to do).	-1
I've played all of our GameCube games with my kids at one time or another, but this one just escapes me.  I don't really see a point to it other than pushing, hitting, shocking, and kicking the other player in the game, which usually raises their ire and they end up pushing, hitting, and kicking each other outside of the game too.  I prefer games like The Incredibles and the Star Wars Lego game that has the two players cooperating in the game instead of competing with each other.  I don't mind competition, but this is just like a kid's version of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, I think.  If I would have known before hand what this game was like, I would not have purchased it.	-1
super smash bros was a dissapointing game there was no storyline what so ever once you beat everything there was nothing more to do. Damn i wished the producers would put more places and characters in the game.	-1
This game, although somewhat fun with 4 people has a terrible single player mode and fight physics that rival that of my grandmother. Hardcore fighting fans must steer clear from this abomination of a game. Inevitably once you get 4 friends over to play the game does become fun, but then surely gets repetitive. As you play for a week you master it without any real skill involved and in the end your just said you spent 50 bucks on a mediocre party game. Don't buy unless your have a 6 year old kid who has 3 friends following him around.	-1
Some reviewers loved all Balder's Gate-related phenomena, I personally thought the story was shallow and lacked anything to really define motivation. Ostensibly "to let the player be the character", your character instead comes across as a vapid individual who has no personality or real lines. Some people liked the "twist" of getting caught up in a plot with magi and demons, but I found it more like an accident and never felt a compelling reason to continue beyond "I haven't beaten the game yet". Castle of the Winds, a now-freeware game for Windows 95 did a better job of getting an adventurer to set out on a dangerous quest. Story: 5/10  If you've played PS1 or PS2-launch titles, you're not far from what you'll see here. The scenery looks nice, but character models are unimaginative and relatively bland. While your appearance changes based on armor, it's not a drastic change and the benefits of new equipment aren't much different than "a new coat of paint". The camera is fixed at a slightly offset top-down that generally doesn't hide obstacles but also doesn't give you a satisfying way to navigate. The lack of differentiation between non-interactive terrain dressing and potentially useful objects like item boxes is also unhelpful. Not terrible, but the lack of distinction brought the score down. Graphics: 5/10  Unexceptional sounds at best, some were annoying. Volume can't be controlled in-game, and the voicing ranged from "bad rivaling cheap kung-fu dubs" to "modestly compelling", with most of it being unimaginative and repetitive - particularly the shops, who won't shut up while you're trying to shop. Sound: 4/10  Little actually stood out, but after having been through soundtracks like .Hack//G.U. or Ace Combat 5, I expect music that won't be missed in an empty elevator. Music: 5/10  A very basic "dungeon crawler", I feel that calling it a hack-and-slash does a disservice to action games like Gauntlet or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dynasty-Warriors-Strikeforce/dp/B001L8DKL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce</a>&nbsp;that do that subgenre justice. Enemies are difficult - you may like or dislike this - but they don't respawn, so if you want to practice or level grind, you have to save character data and start a new game, then import. Random drops and inconsistent ability - enemies tended to hit every swing even if they weren't at optimal range, whereas everything from bows to great swords to daggers had a tendency to miss - not dodged, but simply doing nothing. The fact that everything has a single swing as its whole moveset was especially disappointing, at least Gauntlet had reverse-strokes instead of the same chop time after time. Gameplay: 4/10  You can import character data into any game load that you please, but as awkward as the game felt to play through in the first place and as miniscule as the benefits of revisiting an area are (especially with the steps you have to take), I just can't in good conscience recommend this when there are so many other games that actually let you have fun throughout, and then games like Ratchet & Clank let you cruise back through the story with all the goodies you earned. Replayability: 2/10  If you're a hardcore "dungeon crawler" fan, and think getting a "stained cotton shirt +1" is the greatest thing in gaming, then this game will suit your collection. If you prefer characters with more depth than cardboard cutouts try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/hack-G-U-Vol-3-Redemption/dp/B000R36ABS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">.hack: G.U., Vol. 3: Redemption</a>&nbsp;If you like weapons and magic with nifty utility as well as flashy combat effectiveness, try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Golden-Sun/dp/B00005OARM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Golden Sun</a>. Unfortunately, nothing in this game really earns a special mention. It's a bargain-bin purchase, but not quite worth bargain-bin prices unless you're a particularly avid "dungeon crawler" fan. Overall: 4/10	-1
I beat it in 10 hrs and I was taking my precious time. Its a great game but so short it wasn't worth the money. It was about as long as I would expect the demo to be. The ending is lame, it an advertisement for the next game!!!!! A to be continued!!! Its an outrage! Grrrrr.... I was extremly disappointed in how short they cut this game up, in order to sell the next. I will NOT buy the sequel. It'll be a waste of money. To be continued...	-1
Unlike Rogue Spear and Urban Operations, which were developed by the very talented people at Red Storm Entertainment, Black Thorn was developed by a team of UbiSoft employees in their Montreal office who were trained by people from RSE, but who obviously lack their talent. The level design, modelling, and particularly the texturing were second-rate and amateurish, and doesn't compare to the quality of RSE's work on the previous installments in the Rainbow Six/Rogue Spear series. If you are a fan of Red Storm Entertainment's work then it might be worth buying for the bonus CD (American version only) that contains a feature on the making of Ghost Recon, but don't expect Black Thorn to be on par with Red Storm Entertainment's previous work in Rogue Spear or Urban Operations, or even Covert Operations for that matter. If it weren't for the bonus CD about Ghost Recon, I would have returned it and asked for my money back, it's that bad. Contrary to the rave reviews that UbiSoft employees have been posting around the net posing as fans and customers, Black Thorn is by far the worst in the series - hardly "the best" as they have been claiming.	-1
If you've ever played the final fantacy series (ESPECIALLY the latest one) you will be very, very disappointed. The game playes in a limited area and revolves around solving puzzles. So far so good, but the load time between scenes is horribly long and annoying. I'm a gamer and I could sit hours and play a good game, but this one puts me to sleep after an hour! Every turn you make, you enter a new scene (remember there are limited number of scenes to start with) and you'll have to stare into a black "now loading" screen for up to 7 seconds. I don't recommend it for anyone over 12.	-1
Boring!  This game has nothing to rave over and alot to dispise.  Rent it before buying, or you will be disappointed in losing 50 bucks.	-1
Put Harry Potter in Gauntlet Legends and give him a talking Tinker Bell in a bottle and you've got Night Caster. There's no real plot except get through the levels. Until you get to the end of the game the spells [stink]and all the while villagers and an Irish Miss Cleo are whining at you. The graphics have no detail, which makes the game look like it is a 64 game. Like most Xbox games it's not long but everything along the way will annoy you. Better for younger players.	-1
Anyone who hasn't played this game should rent it, play it, return it, and be done with it.  Crazy Taxi is one of Sega's more successful franchises, yet it's one of it's weakest.  Go figure.	-1
This is a direct port right from the sega dreamcast that adds nothing new. There are only 2 different levels and 4 different characters. I got a class S license (the highest ranking) on both levels with all 4 characters in less then 2 hours. Crazy Box mode (Crazy Box mode is Sega's poor attempt at a career mode) is not fun at all and the missions are either too hard or too easy. There is also no car damage making this game seem totally unrealistic. You can run into a wall for ten minutes and your car will stay in top condition. There is no reward to getting a class S license such as additional characters or levels and possibly the biggest problem with this game is there is NO MULTIPLAYER MODE, which would have added some much needed replay value. I've played Simpson's Road Rage and that game isn't much fun either, the graphics made me want to go throw up, however if you absolutely need a game like this, definetly go for Simpson's Road Rage, at least it has a multiplayer option. Crazy Taxi was fun in arcades but it just doesn't work for consoles, maybe the new Crazy Taxi 3 for XBox will at least be slightly fun. The only reason I gave this game 2 stars is because driving around town in a taxi and taking your customers to their alotted destination within a time limit using any means neccessary is a cool concept and the graphics aren't terrible.	-1
When I first heard of this game,I thought I'd like it. But boy was I wrong! I played Simpsons Road Rage for PS2,and I totally loved it. Then I heard that this was even better,so I got it. It is the worst game ever! There is no point to the game,no hidden characters,no new levels,NOTHING!The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it's only useful if you just want to use it to get high scores,other than that,this game stinks!	-1
DID NOT WORK	-1
I didn't like this game.  PS2 has it's Wipeout Fusion, Xbox has it's Quantum Redshift, and Gamecube has this.  This game dosen't compare to the other systems.  It basicaly is a very mediocre futuristic racing title.  I suggest you stay away.	-1
This controller fits like a glove...a really tight one.  I am 16, and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time!  The Z trigger is in a worthless spot, and it's not easy to use at all (Which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay)!  The analog is in the right place this time (Thank god), but what's with the C analog?  Why can't I just use the the L and R triggers to move the camra!?!  Plus why can't I push the A button?  I swear.  Regardless how big that button is I can't use it right to save my life (And when playing a video game, that could be a bad thing)! Don't even ask me what we'll ever need the D-Pad for, I don't know!  However this is a cool color though, so I gusse that count's for something!  Otherwise I don't recomend!  Nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers (N64 anyone?), and this one is no different!	-1
Okay,like i said about pikmin"it's fun and challenging for the young and old"but THIS?okay,i think gamcube just made one of the kiddest games ever! The name(i mean,super monkey ball?what the stinky kinda name is that?)and the"cute"little monkeys...dumb enough to make me puke! I am not saying gc games are bad(which they are NOT)this is just to psycho! What will someone come up with next,mega bunny hop?	-1
The console I bought was broken. The description did not disclose this.	-1
While Nintendo has a lot of exclusives , it just doesn't compare to ps2 or Xbox in my opinion. Plus some games have multiple disks because the gamecube disk memory is smaller. It is easy to make room for . Overall if you're gonna but one don't pay much for it. I just got one for 24.99 and i already am thinking why did I buy it.	-1
I bought this some time in 2013, and I do remember the price being low. The controller that was bundled with this console was third-party and a bit malfunctioning (or not wholly compatible). By 2015, the console is unable to read any game disks. I guess I got what I paid so little for. Delivery was on time.	-1
I had one back in 2002, and sold it for 22$ a long time ago. I only had 4 games with it, and instead all my time went to my PS2, since it has alot of the same games, and only on ONE disc.  thats almost deal breaking.  another is that its so bland. the handle is a nice touch, but where will you take it? to a friends house? wat about the cords? but a back pack or a licensed bag from the OEM.  ant the odd number of shoulder buttons is pretty cultureshocking coming from a PS controller. also the mold of them is off.  and then the GBA player. WHY NEED A DISC TO PLAY cartridge games? when I lost that disc, I just gave up on it and sold it.  its not old enough to be a classic, but its fans will like it.	-1
I did receive the unit on time, and wrote a short statement on prompt service, giving five stars. However, I doubt the Gamecube was "new" as advertised when I opened the package. The unit smelled like cigarette smoke, and the controller looked as it had been used. When I received my game a few days later, I noticed the left analog stick on the controller was broken. 8-bit Attic is guilty of false advertising. Please avoid this vendor.	-1
I was partially satisfied. I tried the console and that worked perfectly fine, but the controller did not work after a week of using it because the cord snapped in half. I then discovered that the controller was NOT the real controller, it was a cheap brand and it bbroke very easily. If it does not contain "GameCube" in the middle of the controller then it is NOT the expensive kind of controller!!!	-1
OK, there's no reason to have a memory card for the Xbox, because it has a hard drive built in. The ONLY reason that Microsoft is selling these is because they designed them before they decided to put a hard drive in the Xbox. You can save gigabytes worth of information on the hard drive (thats why you don't need a memory card on a computer).  I've saved several games on my Xbox hard drive and it says that its not even 1% full.	-1
i would say 2 and a half, it was fun to play but boring only to have 1-player. Was disappointed in that. This kind of a game should have multiplayer always, otherwise unlocking eveything is just so less special. I woulda given it 4 stars if it would have been multiplayer.	-1
I was a fan of the first installment of Rogue Squadron, but I'm not impressed with where the series has gone.  The main problem for me is visibility: TIE fighters are tiny and almost impossible to see (especially in space battles), making taking them too much of a challenge.  They added a targeting computer feature that helps a bit, but you lose points the longer you use the targeting computer.  Overall, I found portions of this game to be fun, but they need to brighten up the graphics to make it more playable.	-1
I see many other reviews raving about the graphics.  They're right.  Stunning.  But to use an analogy - A beautiful woman with a poor personality, makes for a lousy date.  This Star Wars games is very beautiful, but poor personality.  FLAW: This game is just too hard.  Remember the Star Wars scene where Luke loops rope around Walkers?  It's in the game, but insanely difficult.  It took me about 30 attempts.  Not fun.  Then I went against some shield & planet base. 10 minutes of boredom cruising through asteroids, followed by 1 minute of insane punishment by killer guns.  Dead.  Repeat 10 more minutes of asteroid boredom. Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Argh.  Then I had to kill a Star Destroyer!  One tiny fighter against a Destroyer?!?!?  Nuts.  6 hours later & about 100 attempts, I just barely beat it with about 1% life left.  It was frustrating, NOT fun.  Now I'm on some planet where I get killed off in about 3 minutes.  I've repeated this level another 50 times already, and I made some progress, but I'm not enjoying the time wasted.  Isn't that what gaming's about?  FUN?  Well, this ain't.  I'm dumping this game.  Frankly, I'd rather go replay Colony Wars or Starfox or Elite.  They may not look as pretty, but they make for better dates.  All were challenging w/o making you feel like a hampster stuck in an infinite rolling wheel.  And they were FUN.	-1
Im sure in the dawn of next gen consoles this was the cream of the crop but nowadays we expect more. Im not talking about graphics, Im talking about gameplay. This game is waay too linear and boring. What really bugged me is the death star attack. Was luke,wedge,and biggs the only rebels fighting against the death star??? The attack on the death star was a huge battle, and so dire taht it the rebels lost theyd be as crewed as thai hooker. So why would only send three fighters to take care of a colossus weapon like the death star? Also, luke isn't such a good main character, he gets annoying after...around the second mission. So why does it get the two? because it works, you shot ti-fighters, and its star wars.	-1
This game is so stupid. It took me 3 weeks just to get to the third level. The challenge is too hard for a normal person and the missions are very tedious. I miss straight forward action shooters where the only mission you have to do is shoot other space fighters and beat the boss. That may sound simplistic but done right like in Star Fox its awesome. This game is really dumb.	-1
Rogue Leader was the first game I played for the Nintendo Gamecube. Sadly, it was a poor choice. I own the original Rogue Squadron and I really enjoy the game, so I figured this would be a great first rental. Right from the start though, I was disappointed. The game starts with corny dancing Stormtroopers to some old time music holding up yellow squares to form the Lucas logo or something. Whaa? That kinda breaks the mood... but forgivable. Then I got to the menu screen... scenes from the movies played randomly in the background serving no apparent purpose, except maybe to give the developers less original work to do. When I finally got in game, being new to the Gamecube, I hit the training mission. I figured I'd learn about all the cool abilities of the various crafts and how to best fight the Empire. Instead, I'm "treated" to a empty field with random training icons floating. Most are completely useless, such as "press A to fire... Good Job!!" A few are truly retarted... "You found a Jabba's Palace... GOOD JOB!!". If I had that computer tell me 'good job' just one more time... I would have thrown my controller down right then and there. So, annoyed, I quit and headed for the first mission... Without any good explanation or reason, I'm suddenly fighting above the Death Star. Lasers are shooting everywhere, tie's are flying in every possible direction, and my wingmen are screaming at me for leadership. I liked it. I quickly pull up the targeting computer and take down a few ties. Then I order my wingmen to do the same, and set upon the mission's goals. It was a great mission, but random. Next mission, I'm in an asteroid field. How on earth did I get here? No... never mind... it looks gorgeous, who cares. I'm blasting stuff, having a unconvinced but good time. Sadly, this doesn't last until mission 3. By mission 3 I'm bored, the gorgeous graphics die down to just standard locations, and the missions are very tedious. By the later levels, it was so easy to mess up a small detail and have to start over I said forget it, no more. This game starts off with a major blast (if you avoid the training) and dies quickly from there. It doesn't get better, it just keeps going instead. If you can find it cheap, rent it for the first few levels alone. It'll be fun for a few days. That's only if you can find it cheap or borrow it from a friend. Don't buy this thing unless you're sure. - Rirath_com	-1
After the N64's ultimate failure against the PSX many Nintendo fans (myself included) figured Nintendo would realize its errors and get back on the ball for this new wave of consoles. When the Gamecube was first announced it seemed that it would be a fierce competitor to the Xbox and the PS2. It had a nice variety of exclusive titles and sported a lower price than both other systems. Sadly over time, the majority of the exclusive titles went multiplatform.  The Gamecube uses minidiscs instead of standard CD sized discs. This has its pros and cons. It gives GC games a faster loading time than the PS2 and Xbox but it prevents CDs and DVDs from being loaded into the tray. Minidiscs only hold 1.5gb of data while a standard DVD holds 4.9gb. This makes multiplatform games harder to put on the Cube since most games are around 3.5gb and the smaller size forces developers to cut out certain parts of a game in order to put it on the Cube. Now you know why you're seeing so many games that come out on both PS2 and Xbox but not the Cube. The choice to go with minidiscs ended up biting Nintendo in the butt just like their wild decision to use cartriges for the N64.  As for the control design, the Cube's controller is pretty good. It looks awkward but is actually more comfortable than the Xbox controller. However, when it comes to controllers Sony has dominated that territory with its more simple, yet effective design.  As for online gaming there isn't anything available other than Phantasy Star Online. A couple of years ago Nintendo stated that gamers didn't care about playing games online. They have since retracted that statement and ironically the Nintendo Revolution is expected to have online capabilities.  As far as graphics go, the Gamecube has the edge over the PS2. The Gamecube is capable of Dreamcast quality rendering which the PS2 doesn't have and has 640x480 resolution like the Xbox and Dreamcast.  The games department is where the Gamecube fails miserably. The Gamecube has a smaller library than the Xbox (even though they were launched around the same date) and the PS2's library trumps both systems. If you like lots of great fighting games, sports games, action games, or RPGs then look elsewhere. One can argue that there are some but for the past couple of years a lot of multiplatform games have just been passing over the Cube. Nintendo develops a fair amount of games itself for the system but the majority of the games are the same franchises that were around for the original NES in the 80s. Nintendo continually focuses on making Mario/Pokemon and other kiddie games for the Cube and continually ignores the tastes of adult gamers over the age of 18. Developers like Capcom, Sega, Square, and Namco have realized that the system sells poorly outside of Japan and are more reluctant to release exclusive titles for the Cube. As a result, many former Gamecube exclusives have jumped over to the Xbox and PS2. Over the past year the number of games being released on the Cube has dropped significantly. I hate to say it but it seems as if the system is already dying out and Nintendo's next-gen console isn't even close to being released yet.  While it has better graphical capability than the PS2 and is more affordable than both other systems, the Gamecube has been crippled by its poor game library. I came up on the NES and SNES but with 2 failed systems in a row, I have to say that I will not purchase another Nintedo console. What really disappoints me is the fact that Nintendo just turned its back on the gamers who came up in the 80s and 90s (who made the NES/SNES sucessful) and continues to cater to the younger crowd.	-1
not fun and its hard thank god i rented it cause this game [stinks] its not worth [junk] rent it and find out ur self	-1
Nintendo is turning crap, the only good consoles of all time would be the NES and the SNES. Don't buy.	-1
okay i like nintendo but its just gettin old i mean at E3 they showed a new game called DDR well its new because it has mario in it they copy great games and turns them into crappy versions. But anyways the game cube is okay it just needs to be more less childish.	-1
This really stinks. My cousin has it and he likes it. But the buttons are too far away. THIS STINKS!!!!Dont buy it. THIS STINKS!!!!!!	-1
I had a Playstation 2 then bought a Gamecube. You're much better off just buying a Playstation 2. Any extra games you could play owning a Gamecube don't justify its cost. I wish I had just spent the money on Sly 2, Jak 3, or Ratchet 3. It would have been money better spent. Live and learn.	-1
I own an Xbox but decided to get a Gamecube just to play some of the Mario titles and some other exclusive titles to Gamecube. All the games which I bought are all fantastic, and provide endless fun. However, the system itself leaves ALOT to be desired. I always thought of the Gamecube as the worst of the current three consoles, but actually owning one made me realise its one of the worst consoles ever. The Xbox Controller S is one of the best controllers ever, and the PS2 controller isn't so bad...but the Gamecube controller is horrific. Never have I seen or held such a terrible controller. It feels totally wrong and looks even worse. The original controller's cord is also terribly short. The startup screen for the system and the menu screen are also disgusting, especially when you compare them to a system like the Xbox. The system can't play DVDs or audio cds, unlike the other two competitors. Every extra capability must be purchased as an addon. There are only two memory card slots compared to Xbox's two slots PER controller. Even the power cord sucks, with its large adapter. There are a few positive points however, such as the very compact size of the system, the nice, small size of the Gamecube discs and standard 4 controller ports. However, these small extras don't make up for the absolute nonsense the actual system is. The exclusive games, however, are fantastic and make the system worth it. After all, games are why you buy a gaming system. This review was only an assessment of the actual hardware.	-1
Games with the Star Wars name have rarely been disappointing, going all the way back to the days of the Atari 5200. Even with primitive raster graphics, that Star Wars game sucked in thousands upon thousands of kids and mesmerized them. These days, with graphics that are light years ahead of the old 5200, the entire experience can be that much more enjoyable. Sadly for me, I had more fun watching this game than playing it. I will qualify this review for you - I am not very good at flying games. I am much better at sports games, strategy games, and an occasional adventure here and there. Even driving games weren't my style until Gran Turismo 3 came along for the PS2. Like my experience with SSX for the PS2, this game came as part of a bundle, and it wasn't one I thought I'd really enjoy. Unlike SSX, Rogue Squadron II has failed to draw me in. If you've played Rogue Squadron on the N64, you'll have an idea of what to expect - pick a specific ship, choose your mission (in this version, you start with two choices, a training mission and your first real one), and complete your objectives to earn a medal and unlock the next objective. Do better at the same mission and earn a better medal. Get enough medals and other good things happen. Simple enough to explain, and easy enough to follow. The early missions spell out your objectives fairly well, although there may be more details that you'll need to learn as you proceed. The graphics are excellent, from the shadows of your craft on Tatooine, to the dogfights over the Death Star with asteroids floating in the background, to the recreation of scenes from the various movies in the Options menu. If you are watching, you'll definitely get your money's worth. If you're playing, you'll need to remind yourself to stay focused. The game play is well done, too - you'll find yourself leaning to one side or another to avoid oncoming TIEs, leaning back to pull up as you barely avoid crashing into the side of Beggar's Canyon, and wondering how the heck you're supposed to keep track of 20 enemy craft, space objects, and numerous enemy ground support. Don't worry, though, because you'll get help on some missions. As in previous games, you can ask your wingmen to stay in formation with you or pursue other objectives as you take care of business yourself. I didn't have too much trouble directing them with the D-pad, but you will have to make sure that you don't suddenly swing to the side and see one of them in your sights. The game play is good, all right - too good for me. In the first mission, flying through the trench in the Death Star proved to be costly again and again. I found myself consistently burning up my three ships (you can die up to three times before your game is over, although dying too many times will jeopardize your chances at better medals) trying to move up and down around the obstacles while avoiding the lasers from Darth Vader and his helpers. The various craft respond a little too realistically for my taste, and in the training mission on Tatooine, I found myself cursing the controls as I tried unsuccessfully to keep up with Wedge and Biggs, watching their computer-controlled craft easing past me race after race. Perhaps some of it is simply my being accustomed to the response of a car on the road - much less inertia and much more control. In any event, I found it difficult to sit down and play the missions again and again. One of the drawbacks or challenges to the multi-part missions is that you have to complete all the parts to finish the mission. Make it through the first two, fail the third, and you're back to square one. It reminds me a bit of Dark Forces on the PC, which was infamous for its exceedingly long levels later in the game that provided no save opportunities until they were completed. Again, though, this was based strongly on personal preference. If you are a fan of Star Wars, air combat games, or both, you'll probably love this game. In any event, if you're getting a GameCube bundle, you're not going to have much choice. The advantage in a seller's market is that you can certainly sell it if you don't want to keep it! However, you may find that hanging in there and playing through it will make it worth your while. As for me, I'm getting back in my RX-7 LM Race Car.	-1
you know, the games aren't that good for this,  classic systems are better	-1
Ok let's get the facts. When diehard gamecube fans say things like the PS2 will get weaker and weaker, that's not true the PS2 keeps getting stronger because it has the greatest and most variety of games--- a known fact. another fact is that people say the the PS2's are selling so much beter than gamecube and Xbox because of DVD, isn't true.  People realize that the DVD function may not be the greatest, but they buy the PS2 for the games.  People also say that the PS2 has a weaker game play quality and graphics- take a game like Virtual fighter 4- that has a greater polygon rate. so before you buy any system look at both sides of the story!!	-1
Well...I see no difference here than from any other Nintendo product. I mean C'MON!!! Hasn't there already been 100 nintendo systems... Who cares about how good the graphics are, that's all that changes for nintendo. Get some new games. All I here from Nintendo64, Gamecube, and other nintendo stuff is always Mario, Luigi and Pokemon. Thats all Nintendo has. Look at psx and ps2, they've got over 100 or even 200 games maybe Nintendo products would be a little bit better if they got more games.	-1
This controller fits like a glove...a really tight one.  I am 16, and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time!  The Z trigger is in a worthless spot, and it's not easy to use at all (Which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay)!  The analog is in the right place this time (Thank god), but what's with the C analog?  Why can't I just use the the L and R triggers to move the camra!?!  Plus why can't I push the A button?  I swear.  Regardless how big that button is I can't use it right to save my life (And when playing a video game, that could be a bad thing)! Don't even ask me what we'll ever need the D-Pad for, I don't know!  However this is a cool color though, so I gusse that count's for something!  Otherwise I don't recomend!  Nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers (N64 anyone?), and this one is no different!	-1
Cheap Recommended for parts only.	-1
I purchased three of these. One never worked right and the other two stopped working after only a few uses	-1
Lacks rumble and feels rather flimsy. But you get what you pay for. Added one star because it still works after 3 months of use.	-1
I can apreciate the work that went into creating a game with this degree of complexity, and I really wanted very much to love this game. However, I have to give it 2 stars for an overall rating of how fun it is to play. I get the impression from the on-line discussion boards that in order to do well at this game, you need to devote yourself to it on a more-or-less full-time basis for months, if not years. If you don't have the time to make that kind of committment to make to a computer game, you might find this rough going. I found the overall design to be satisfactory, and I like the way you can easily group, ungroup, regroup, and maneuver your armies. It would be nice to be able to exert more control over what your armies are doing once they engage in combat (the only combat control you can exercise is to choose to flee; the resolution of battles occurs automatically, without your control), but that is minor point for me. You can also exercise considerable control over many aspects of your society, such as your tolerance for other religions, the degree to which you want to specialize in land or naval power, whether you want to be innovative or closed-minded, and so on. There is a lot here to like. However, there are two big issues that reduce the fun (and the replayability) for me. The first is the constant problem of revolutions. As another reviewer pointed out, you should plan to spend hours of real time endlessly shuttling your armies around trying to stamp out one revolution after the next. This is astoundingly tedious after awhile. The second is the fact that you are completely locked in to the real history of your country. If you are playing China, and China historically suffered a huge government scandal in 1699, when 1699 rolls around you are screwed no matter how you've played so far. It occured to me that the point of the game is not really to expand your empire, but to try your hand at re-playing actual historyy. This does have its interesting moments, but it zaps the replayability to 0. Do I really want to play Spain again and go through all the exact same historically driven events over agin? Not really. This locked-in history also really limits the number of countries that you can expect to play enjoyably. Yes, it's often said that there are 200 countries, and you can play any of them. However, the historical inevitability built into the game limits the fun factor for most. Few countries are even able to explore the world beyond their known lands, because you need special exploring units to all you to venture into new map zones, and the historically colonial countries just have a built-in edge in the number of explorers they receive. You can play the Inca empire if you'd like to spend several hours staring at the same 20 provinces, with no way to explore beyond them. Overall, I have to say that I don't really consider this to be a "game." It is more like a very detailed history sim. Judging from the positive reviews here and the on-line message boards, there are plenty of people out there who love this, and I can see how that might be possible for someone who has lots and lots and lots of time to spend learning it, and who does not mind the built-in history. I would have preferred something a little less pre-ordained and labor intensive.	-1
Although the GameCube in itself is a stellar gaming console (five stars), this package forces us to buy products that we not do want or need. Unfortunately, Amazon.com and many other online stores have not taken the people with a limited budget, or who  simply do not want to spend ($$$)on games, into consideration.  Although everything offered in this package is of exceptional quality (except maybe the third party accesories) and deserves nothing but praise, the marketers behind what is offered here believe that people have hundreds of excess dollars lying around to spend on unwanted extras. Do yourself a favor and buy the GameCube when it arrives alone, but do not spend your money on this overpriced marketing scheme.	-1
Gamecube: Best Game-  Star Wars Rogue Leader Best Feature- Game Boy Advance Capibility Graphics Rating- 4 stars Xbox: Best Game- Halo Best Feature- Dvd Playback Graphics Rating- 5 I admit that Star Wars Rogue Leader is a very good game but the rest of the games on gamecube you can get on another console or the games stink. Some people don't have Game Boy Advance (i do) but having a feature that all people cant have is not a very good best feature. Graphics for the gamecube I think are not that special, the graphics even look somewhat similiar to the first playstation. Halo is a very good game most people should enjoy it even if they don't like first person shooters. The best feature for the xbox is dvd Playback some people may not like a video game system having a dvd because they think a video game system should be for video games only, well i still don't understand why that should keep them from buying the xbox if you don't like the fact that dvd Playback is the best feature for xbox than you don't have to use it. Oddworld Munchs Oddysey is the game that has the worst graphics for xbox  but still the graphics are better than some of the gamecube games. I hope this review helped you decide between xbox and gamecube.	-1
I was hoping for another great stratagy game that I could add to my large collection of PC games. I usually love Stratagey games, but this game is an exception. The game is very buggy and feels cheesy. For example, when you try to click on something, it takes many clicks before it gets the messgage. And no it isn't lag. I forced myself to play it for several hours thinking that if I gave it a chance, I'd learn to like it, but I just hated it more an more with every waking moment. This game reminds me of a much downgraded civilization 2. Trust me. There a many good stratagey games out there. This just isn't one of them.	-1
I actually would really like a gamecube right now, but WHY can't they just have a simple gamecube for sale?  Why do they have to bundle it with a ton of stuff that not everyone may want right away?  This kind of sneaky marketing makes it a lot more difficult for those who have smaller budgets to work with, to get a game system, and not just Nintendo is doing this, Microsoft and Sony are just as guilty.  Come on you guys let the little gamers have a chance to play too!	-1
Anyway, read styx138's review before you consider buying this. I'm buying an Xbox now and possibly a gamecube later. I've heard too many complaints from import owners of the GCN to be excited about the gamecube. If you're older than 12 then why would you settle for a GCN? As a 22 year old gamer Nintendo games for the most part stopped appealing to me around age 15. My policy on GCN is "wait and see" for now.	-1
I was just about to buy this wheel until I decided to read the reviews. Thanks to all reviewers for your input. I'll look around for a different wheel. I just picked up Midnight Club2 and need a wheel. So far I've bought 2 items from MadCatz and they've worked fine. You win some and you lose some I guess.	-1
Like others, I found that this controller doesn't work.  It "crashes" every few minutes - halting the game and requiring the user to press the START button to continue. If it wasn't for this significant flaw, I would have given it a 5 star rating.  However, this flaw makes it totally unusable in my opinion.  It was returned to the store.	-1
To see how ripped off Nintendo is, let's do a simple conversion math.  The goal is to find a 59 Blocks card has how many Mega Byte or Kilo Byte?  Let us do some calculation  8 Bit = 1 Byte  1 Mega Bit or Byte = 1024 Kilo Bit or Byte  Memory Card 59 Blocks = 4 Mbit = 4096 Kbit = 512 KByte  512 KByte / 59 blocks = 8.678 KByte  How much is nintendo charging?  $9.00  How large is Playstation 2 card?  8 Mega Byte = 64 Mbit = 59 blocks *64/4 = 944 Blocks  How much are we paying for 512 MByte SD, Compact Flash, or Memory Stick?  Around $8.00 or even Free.  And who wants 512MB cards these days?  Not a lot of people.  Lets use the $8.00 = 512MB = 60416 Blocks as of today's standard. That means 59 blocks should be only $1.32415e-4 = $0.0001324  Wow so Nintendo is actually making 755101% profit by charging at $1.00.	-1
This costs way too much, it hold way too little, spend the extra for the 251 or whatever. This will run out immediately, especially with owning TH3, RE and Smash Bros. Melee.	-1
The days of just anyone making a video game are gone. A good game requires more than graphics.  It requires people who know how to make a good control interface, and write interesting, creative stories.  Support excellence in gaming and save your money.	-1
If you love LONG segments of nothing but talking this game is for you. Half this game is you trying to extract the right info from people and only one tenth of what they have to say is useful. The rest is the standard "shooting the breeze" that game makers think creates "atmosphere". Gothic held some comic value for me as I started to see it not as an adventure game, but as a bizzare excersize in making boring people get to the point. This is a useful skill to develop in this world so I give Gothic an extra star. Why do game makers feel the irrational need to make you learn a completely different control system for every new game? Gothic is the worst in this example of this trend. Sure there's SOME key binding customization available--just not for the actions you actually want. Not only are you banned from binding actions to mouse buttons, but Xicat breaks new ground in game control idiocy by forcing you to hold down TWO(2) keys to do practically everything.	-1
