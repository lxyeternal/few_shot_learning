This is a nice product. I use it around the house and when I am moving around electricity. It's not a huge test instrument but it "fills a hole" in my growing tool box.	1
This is sort of "lacking in real quality" but what do you expect for $25?  So, the fact that it works, though you do it with no real idea of any sort of accuracy of any kind, and it does the basic function, that of telling you "Hey, you have a lot of leakage power here!" --- it does that well.  Example:  I took it down to my newer GE over-the-stove micro wave oven.  From the very front, it was not too bad,  but from the sides, and top/bottom, it went ballistic and set off the lights and buzzer.  TI'm afraid that this is sort of typical from all of society and electronics manufacturers. (A lot of money rides on this stuff!)  On my older later 1980's vintage Ammana Radar Range?  Almost zero leakage and detectable output.  Our standards are so lax these later years that almost anything goes and THAT is probably not good for our bodies.  No radiation in general is good for you when it is large enough that it causes currents to flow through you on a cellular level inside you body...... it is a cumulative thing - and some folks are MUCH more suseptable to it than others so the people who set the standard are hard put to set a point of safety:  safe for me may be unsafe for you.  Think of this:  after 15 or 20 years of such high levels of exposure..... what shape will you be in?  The associations have not been PROVEN yet because it takes so much time, but cancer and tumors are the primary concerns, in general, right now...... the big Questions are, "How much is too much and for how long?"  No one absolutely knows this yet.  (It could a bit like, "We always suspected that cancer & cigaretts went together!")  We all know already that cell phones output a LOT of radiation..... the further from the cell tower you are located when you talk, the higher the cell outputs it's signal strength to get the connection working well, and.... the greater the risk to your body and brain cells.  We all already KNOW this fact, we do NOT NEED a meter to tell us this as new information..... and this device will not really give you a real good idea of how much you are getting exactly anyway.  However, what it will do, is that it will tell you when you need to get further away from some radiating appliance, phone, TV, microwave oven, or such.... to some degree anyway.  What makes this a good deal?  As opposed to spending 5 times as much (or more) for a "Tri-Meter" is that it gives you a general idea with more ability to tell one level from another.  It does not cost you $150 to find out what you already knew intuitively anyway.  (humor intended here)  If you want real quality, do not mind paying for a higher level of precision and accuracy, you can do as I did and buy something like the ExTech 480836...... aaaand you will spend basically $250 too.  It is NICE!  Has some real good quality in it equal to many of the good quality multi-meters you can get, and it is also tri-mode ops which is a plus compared to a single mode like this one.  So, I use this to give rough estimates in ultra-low frequency applications only, and it has a rather short close range limited ability too.  But for $25 what more could you ask for?  The small probe is a nice conventient added plus for it as well.  Enjoy!	1
This also works great for me. I like it better than the other one I have because it does have the sensor separate.	1
Everything works as you would expect.  My only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because this thing seems to devour batteries, and the front button pushes on a bit too easily.  I've put this in my backpack and had it go off while walking around. Overall, seems well built, testing things all around my house and work, quite interesting! Used it to check my 'smart meter' they installed on my house cause I sit about 6 feet from the meter.	1
I bought this to attempt aiming a cell phone amplifier antenna.  It did not register at all so cheerfully returned it.	-1
I purchased this device to aid in tracking down severe electrical noise that disrupts ham radio communications, and it works great for this.  Very easy to locate the "noisy gizmos".  Oh, and to the guy who left the only "one star" vote for this:  yours must just be defective because I detect more ghosts than I do electrical noise... maybe you're just doing it wrong?  <wink>  Dave	1
We have had our Ghost investigation group now going on 30+ years, my specialty in the group is equipment & new equipment reviews & do they work or not, well this one is just about the only piece of equipment, we've ever purchased that never registered the presence of a spirit in any known haunted location where we had verified with other equipment that something was there, it just never worked, it's great in detecting your microwave or power lines or something, but to top it off, you have to plug into it and use the long wire with the sensor on the end, so it's inconvenient to carry, & none of our members ever wanted to fool with it, get a ghost meter or K-2 meter or any other cheap EMF Meter that works, but not this one, I even modified it by adding a long antenna to the sensor to give it more range, still nothing.	-1
Good cutting oil for steel but very stinky	1
works great for hole saw through metal	1
will save drill bits taps and milling bits. And if you have ever spent the money on a large bit you know you must keep it good. I have bits that cost a hundred dollars. Use a cut oil and never use one bit to make the hole. Start out with a small bit and keep going up in size till you reach the size you need. expl: If I need a 33mm hole I start with 1mm than 4mm,7mm,10mm,13mm,16mm,19mm,21mm,24mm,27mm,30mm,32mm than I will let everything cool down and drill the last hole slow and with the 33mm bit. this will save the life of your bigger bits and give you a little more pride in your work. After you see how well made your build is, you can talk yourself up but the quality of the work will do that for you. And never drill without a good cut oil.	1
Used for hand cutting threads in 1 inch black pipe. Worked wonderfully.	1
I don't know how this stuff works, but you will be able to drill holes you never could before. Makes the bit cut long spirals of steel, even with a dulled bit! Great stuff!	1
I used this to cut threads and it worked perfectly. The threads almost cut themselves.	1
is good.	1
Seems to make better finishes when milling or turning.	1
Cutting oil a must have for drilling holes, cutting threads, etc. It works well and saves your drill bits.	1
Good cutting oil for drill press use.  This is my second bottle. I'm knocking it down one star as the bottle leaks at the threads, dripping where I don't want oil. Other than that it works well.	1
What else is there to say, it's great cutting oil.	1
This Dark Cutting Oil is quality stuff. I use it for tapping and drilling. On my drill press if I am drilling a very hard metal I'll put a drop of oil right on the drilling point & works great. I can easily tell the difference in using the oil or not. Keeps my drill bits sharp longer.	1
One of the best cutting Fluids in the Industry. Not too thin and not too thick. Very dark in color and has some odor to it. It's much better then Tap Magic . But hey don't take my word for it. Try it yourself.	1
works great cuts the grease	1
Works great.	1
must have for drilling steel	1
Works well, no issues	1
ok.	1
If you drill into steel you got to use this stuff. I used it to cut into 1/4" steel with a 2' hole saw. Cut great, 5 holes no dulling. I tried to drill with out it.. Ya don't do it..	1
Old plumbers trick when using cutting oil, a small bowl or cup of rubbing alcohol to dip your pipe tips in before and after threading galvanized. The new ALL made in china pipe has a die clogging goo on them. Rubbing alcohol will loosen it and then it will strip the oil off after threading so your pipe dope sticks. This is the best brand going for cutting oil whether your a plumber or just tapping a bolt hole in a old engine.	1
Got this to clean my Dyson Humidifier monthly.  Seems like a reasonable price for the size of the package.  A little goes a long way.  I plan to run a mixture through my Kurig coffee maker as well.	1
As advertised	1
Great	1
This stuff works. I also used it to clean out my plugged-up radiator. Best ever flush.	1
I own a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Megahome/dp/B00026F9F8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Megahome</a>&nbsp;brand distiller, and there are several different ways I clean the residue from its stainless-steel kettle, in each case unplugging the distiller first:  1. I pour 3 cups of white vinegar in the kettle and fill it to the top with plain water, then let it soak overnight. Before emptying it, I scrub the sides and bottom of the kettle with a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/long-handled-dish-brush-with-firm-bristles/dp/B0000CFL6J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">long-handled dish brush with firm bristles</a>&nbsp;to remove any remaining, stubborn residue. This works great if the kettle does not have a lot of residue. If it has a heavy buildup, I fill the kettle half full of undiluted white vinegar and let it soak in the kettle for 3-4 hours. Then I fill the kettle to the top with water and let it soak overnight.  2. I fill the kettle with water and stir in 3 tablespoons of these citric-acid crystals, then let it soak overnight. This also works well if the tank does not have a lot of residue. If there is a lot of residue, then I use more than 3 tablespoons and/or I let it soak longer, and I also use the long-handled dish brush with firm bristles to scrub the sides and bottom of the kettle after it is done soaking, before emptying out the soak water.  3. When I'm in a hurry and don't want to soak the kettle overnight, or just to prevent massive buildup of residue--which happens really fast where I live because the water is very hard--I put a tablespoon of these citric-acid crystals in the kettle and lightly moisten them with 2-3 tablespoons of water. I then use a the dish brush to scrub the sides and bottom of the kettle. These crystals have a rough texture that, along with the bristles of the brush and the acid in the crystals, acts to immediately remove all the residue, leaving the stainless steel bright and clean.  I purchased this product because of the convenience of the amount, a full pound, and the excellent price. I will happily purchase this brand again.	1
Necessary for home distillers to remove residue and scale. Bulk much more cost effective. Works well	1
This tape is nice for a couple reasons. I like the widths and the quantity you get per roll. If you do the math it is a great deal. Thanks	1
I've been using this tape for years.  No complaints.  It activates easily, and adheres very well.  It does what is expected of sealing tape, nothing more, nothing less.	1
Very accurate - my readings were within 0.0002" of the machine shop's measurements, which is pretty crazy when you think about it.  Helped me diagnose an out-of-round condition for two bores, but I was unfortunately unable to do anything about it as I could not source oversized pistons.  So the bores were honed as much as possible to still allow the same pistons to be safely used.  With the engine running and building proper compression and no blow-by, it seems there have been no downsides.	1
I didn't buy this for any immediate need, rather an ongoing use as needed. I haven't had a chance to actually measure a bore yet but, It COULD earn another star if only it had instructions in English.	-1
I received a similar item. but in a blue case.  No big deal there.  However, one of the points was missing, and it was not the one that ships installed in the gauge (which was there).  Other reviewers have reported a similar issue, saying they didn't need it so it wasn't a big deal.  I didn't need it (yet) either, but I might in the future, and I paid for a complete kit.  I did not spend a ton of time analysing the quality of item.  It seems like typical overseas mediocrity, but I'm sure it would've worked well enough for me had I kept it.  Didn't bother with a replacement since this seems a common complaint and I don't want to keep wasting time.	-1
Have not used it yet but seems to be well made.	1
Shipped on time and arrived in good condition.  Was easy to use and when used the engine with 190000 miles on it checked out great.  In my opinion well worth the price.	1
Excellent Product and Seller. A+++++	1
This was a darn good purchase. I got it through Amazon's warehouse deals. Try obtaining a vise like this quality for the price you can obtain via Amazon. Solid construction.	1
This vice is very well made.  Precisely machined.  Worth the cost.	1
So far it's turned out to be a very nice vise for the money.  Very handy to have when a third hand is needed.	1
As expected	1
Great like Prevident 5000 and still no SLS. Fluoride does not expire. Good for adults.	1
great as always	1
Gel-Kam does work as advertised. Brushing it on teeth applies fluoride to strengthen the enamel. Unfortunately it is not as effective as Prevident. Its 0.4% concentration is weak in comparison to Prevident's 1.1%.	1
My dentist recommended this to me for a very sensitive and exposed wisdom tooth root.  It just took one application and I was hooked!  It actually dissipated the pain and sensitivity and put me in a more tolerable zone.  Now, 10 years later, I still reach for Gel Kam whenever I have a sensitivity issue with my teeth and gums.  I am extremely sensitive by nature, hence my motto -- some people say, "No pain, no gain" but not me, I say, "No Pain - NO PAIN!!" And this product helps keep me pain free and smiling!  Which is very important to me and my outlook.  Bravo Gel Kam!!  It's hard to find locally, so I'm glad to find it here on Amazon, and so reasonably priced!	1
satisfied	1
great!	1
Spend the bucks and get the real thing, not the cheap imitations.  Your teeth will thank you for it.	1
good product	1
These are the original Sonicare heads, don't even bother with the generic ones. I've now tried several generics to save money, and ended up with heads that were so loose they vibrated off the toothbrush or so sharp they cut my gums. Save yourself the headache and just buy the original heads. I love these because they are compact and fit in smaller mouths.	1
My favorite size to get it  and get things clean. To back they are pricy	1
The best	1
I have been using the Sonicare for years and these smaller heads do a better job of cleaning my teeth than the larger ones.	1
These teeth bush spares work very well on my Phillips sonic tooth brush device.  What else would you expect.  These reviews can get annoying.	1
I love my Sonicare, and try to buy multiple brushes (to save money) since my dentsist really insists I keep the brushes fresh and new. I prefer the compact brush, and like that these come with different colored rings so if you have multiple users in the same household, you can color code the brushes. Fine enough.	1
Both my husband and myself have smaller mouths.  This toothbrush is the nicest size and does the job well.  Really a great size!!	1
Like ink cartridges, they have us over a barrel. Without the replacement heads, one's Sonicare is useless; the price has gone up over $5 for the compact 3-pack. Anyhow, the compact bristles are about 5/8", compact for those of us with smallish mouths, and easier around the back of the molars. I'd always bang around with the standard-size brushes, giving myself a jolt and a shock. However, the standard 3-pack size is less expensive and covers more surface, I'll go back to the other size.  Update: while removing the compact brush head, it came off in two parts... just swell. Still works, but I will use a screw driver to pry off the brush head next time. Not what I expected for anything this expensive.	-1
These are the original type of toothbrushes that come with the Sonicare (same size, and brushtype).  These brushes are very good, however because of the fast brushing, and when using it together with the UV-bacteria killing bulb, the blue lines on the brush fade quite fast (blue hairs that become white are an indicator of changing the brush).  If you ask me, the brush is perfect, not too hard, not too soft, brushes well between the teeth.  However at the rate that brushes need to be replaced, and considering their size, they should sell them for half the price. I still think $10/brush is a ripoff...	1
We purchased the Sonic Care brush system at the advice of our dental hygienist.  It arrived in time and was in good shape, just as advertised. Packaging was good and I am quite happy with the purchase. The system takes a little getting used to, but works very well. The oscillation of the brush head is a strange sensation on your teeth and gums, but once you get used to it the system works very well. We have noticed better reports each time we go in for cleaning.	1
I like the new better than the old (newer model toothbrush unit)..  I feel there is less mold buildup that plagued the older models.. I haven't had the problems some people report (but I do not use the color rings that might be the cause?)..	1
These new heads, which fit ONLY the new Flexcare and ProResults models of brushes, are superior to the old Elite style brush heads in several ways.  1. No more old toothpaste/mildew/mold/germs collecting in the base of the brush head! By far the most unpleasant aspect of the old Sonicare brushes, this problem is gone with the smaller, simple to rinse off ProResults heads.  2. New "indicator" bristles let you know when it's time to change. A common feature in manual brushes, it's nice to see this on a Sonicare brush head.  3. Less waste - there is less bulk to the new ProResults heads, meaning much less waste and more environmental benefit. The metal content has been reduced as well, making these heads about even or even better than regular manual brushes in environmental impact.  4. Best of all, the new models are actually CHEAPER than the old models. You get a 3 pack of brush heads for what 2 of the old brush heads costs. They're still more expensive than manual brushes, but its worth the price for the superior brushing experience.  Overall the new brush head system is great - just make sure it fits your handle.  You need a Flexcare or ProResults Sonicare handle to use these brush heads (sorry elite and essence users!).	1

I've been using these compact brush heads instead of the regular ones that came with my Sonicare. I find it much, much easier to clean in the back and on the insides and they are well worth it. They do wear pretty quickly and it's hard to tell if they are worn until you compare them with new heads. I don't get 3 months out of one and when I switch to a new one it is very easy to tell the difference.  My dentist tells me that you can get better cleaning from a manual toothbrush and the key is really in the technique. But he does agree that if this is what it takes to motivate you to brush well and often then it's worth it. The only reason I mention this is that these heads are expensive and need to be replaced pretty frequently so if there are budgetary concerns I would definitely recommend sticking with a regular toothbrush.  In any case, these are much better and seem to clean better than the full-sized heads.	1
Love the size of this brush!  Makes it easy to get behind the front teeth, and in all the nooks and crannys that a full-size brush will miss. The small size does mean it takes a bit longer to brush, but that's a minor issue.  Wish it had the same feature as the Braun system where the bristles turn color when it wears out. The Sonicare set comes with a set of labels so you can mark them as to when it's time to toss (they recommend every three months, but you can usually get 4 months out of it).	1
First of all, these gloves run very small in size.  I have an average sized ladies hand and the size large is slightly snug.  Next time I'll order x-large.  Amazon's description states these are FDA approved.  I couldn't find anywhere on the box that states that.  I'm going to use these gloves for cleaning and dirty work out in the yard.  Amazon has a great price for these gloves, it can't be beat.	1
Too small for extra large hands!	-1

Review for: Dynarex Safe-Touch Blue Nitrile Disposable Gloves  Exam quality (a standards term referring to a low pinhole count), fairly thick and tough compared to many more cheaply made gloves, but not too thic, often found well-priced for the quality.  These disposable gloves work great for light tasks like:  - Greasy cooking - Household and office cleaning - Planting seedlings - Laundry - Light oily or greasy automotive work - Spackling - Staining or painting  We found these to be:  - Finger grippy - Flexible - Easy to put on and take off - Quite strong and puncture resistant as these thin gloves go (air pressure test, blunt puncture test) - High degree of tactile sensitivity.  There are thicker disposable gloves in the 5-14 mil range, these ones are 4-4.5 mil.  However, these gloves should meet the needs of most of the light household and office duties noted above with relative comfort and price value.  In the quality section below we'll cover pinholes.  The manufacturer claims the gloves use their older 1997 patent (#35,616 for the curious) for the benefit of longer-term comfort after 5 minutes or so.  The degree to which this really offers an improved experience who knows but they do seem relatively comfortable. There are 4 sizes for these gloves, I would have preferred to see 5+ sizes like some manufacturers offer, but if you can find one that fits that's all that matters, of course.  For those that care about such things, folks trying these out thought these had a more attractive shade of blue compared to some of the other blue disposable gloves when compared side-by-side.  Acceptable for food handling.  QUALITY: ---------  For those in healthcare seeing the word "Exam" on the box and wondering, the manufacturer confirms these are "Medical Exam" grade (which ONLY means under 2.5 PINHOLE DEFECTS per 100 gloves).  They are non-sterile.  For those not looking for a healthcare application, what this means to you is the highest available U.S. quality standard measure category for chances of pinholes in the gloves.  Any higher quality claim is done individually by the manufacturer.  For example,1.5 AQL is common since that is also the European MDD and PPE requirement, so several manufacturers claim that for some of their gloves.  A higher level European certification is 0.65 AQL (pinholes per 100 gloves) so you'll see that AQL claimed for some gloves, as well.  1.0 AQL is fairly common, too, though there is no matching certification I'm aware of.  LONGER ARM PROTECTION: -------------  As they are more difficult to find, here are some disposable gloves with longer forearm protection, something to consider:  - Aurelia Glove's Robust Plus -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kimberly-Clark-Safety-50602-Safeskin-Nitrile-Xtra-Exam-Gloves-12-34-Length-Medium-Purple-Pack-of-50/dp/B00U8VD74M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kimberly Clark Safety 50602 Safeskin Nitrile-Xtra Exam Gloves, 12" Length, Medium, Purple (Pack of 50)</a> -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Medline-Sensicare-Non-Sterile-Powder-Free-Latex-Free-12-Inches-Nitrile-Exam-Gloves-Blue-Medium-50-Count/dp/B00810940S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Medline Sensicare Non-Sterile Powder-Free Latex-Free 12 Inches Nitrile Exam Gloves, Blue, Medium, 50 Count</a> -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sempermed-Sempershield-SSNF-Blue-Medium-Nitrile-Powder-Free-Disposable-General-Purpose-Examination-Gloves-Medical-Grade-Rough-Finish-SSNF103-PRICE-is-per-BOX/dp/B006RNSE3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sempermed Sempershield SSNF Blue Medium Nitrile Powder Free Disposable General Purpose & Examination Gloves - Medical Grade - Rough Finish - SSNF103 [PRICE is per BOX</a>]  NOTES: -------  Overview: - Nitrile, Powder-Free.

The latex gloves or at least the brand i had kept breaking and couldn't be considered safe or sterile when failing in the middle of a messy job! These stay together so much better and feel good.	1
Excellent	1
cheap and thick:)	1
This was shipped fast and it was added to my emergency medical supplies	1
Product was as described.	1
Fits Perfect. Very durable.	1
Fit perfectly and hold up well	1
These fit well.	1
Wont buy any other gloves. Perfect	1
Favorite gloves.  Sturdy	1
good product and decent price	1
Excellent!	1
Just what I wanted, quite pleased with purchase.	1
Great price, hold up much better than latex	1
I used gloves around the house for cleaning, cutting raw meat and pet wounds.  I have purchased the same brand nitrile gloves for quite a while.  These are a great value, and they are very durable.  I did have one glove in my last box of them (they were more than a year under my sink I think however), that did break when I pulled it on.  These are not like dishwashing gloves where you can scrub for hours on end and not wear through them, but they are perfect for every day tasks and cheap enough to dispose of with no guilt.  Give them a try!	1
Really nice gloves to use. Easy to get on and off the hands. Much better gloves than the more traditional Latex gloves. They also seem to tear less often.	1
Good gloves	1
Works just as expected in vet school lab setting.	1
Great product. Highly recomment	1
These gloves are good quality and were cheaper than buying them locally.  They are good for cleaning and doing the dishes and that sort of thing.	1
Good quality, latex-free gloves. One really cannot wax poetic about them. They work, they are tear-resistant, and the price is right.	1
Used in science class.	1
These gloves are flexible and comfortable. Great price. The seller got them to me quickly. They are blue. They stretch a little, and slide on and off easily.	1
In my opinion, these gloves are terrible. I bought them to work on my car and other light chemical work. These things constantly tear time and time again. When you try and put on a new glove after a tear it is pretty much impossible since these are not powdered and run small. The moisture on your hands keeps the glove from going on smoothly and you have to wait a minute or two for your hands to dry to put on a new glove. Maybe I got a bad batch, I don't know. I was tearing gloves just trying to put them on.  The gloves fit great and have great tactile feedback so that is a plus but I won't be buying these again anytime soon. If you are a home mechanic then I would look at a different glove. If it is other light work such as wood work, painting and staining then these will probably work well.	-1
It is easy to see why these are listed as Amazon's #1 best seller for exam gloves. They are good quality and reasonably priced. There are a lot of reviews on them, too many to read all of them. After I received the product I wished I had paid more attention to some of the negative comments (unfortunately listed by the reviewer under a 5-star rating) about sizing. These gloves run smaller than you may be used to. I have smaller than average hands and a medium glove should have, well, fit like a glove. But they are so small I could not get my fingers all the way in. Snug is one thing, and for a glove like this snug is good, but to be useful the glove has to go all the way on to the hand. Keep in mind that a 4-star rating is not bad ... Amazon's definition is "I Like It". And I do like the product. It would have earned one additional star if the sizing was more accurate.	1
Great value and quality when you do a lot of painting.  If you're in a shop with an air compressor, expanding them by blowing them up and blowing air into them when you want to take them off helps as your hands naturally become sweaty, so you can use them a # of times before they tear.	1
Gloves fit perfect, they work great, low price.	1
fits great, not too tight, not too big... and pretty durable for basic painting, caulking etc..	1
its very good	1
They fit ok. I think I may order the large ones the next time.	1
Excellent quality just like in the hospital.  None were damaged in the box.  First quality	1
Preformed well, Several times when the gloves weren't too soiled with paint or cut etc. they were sturdy enough to remove and use next time.	1
These gloves fit true to size and are well made. I like the fact that the material is not super thin like some gloves you buy that rip as you are putting them on and the ribbed cuff is an added plus making it easy to take them off.	1
Wonderful Product	1
repurchase	1
Nitrile gloves, not much to say other than good price and delivered to your door. As with all nitrile gloves, if not treated carefully when putting them on they can tear.	1
nice	1
Caregiver and I are pleased with these exam gloves. Gloves (medium) fit both of us fine and we have rather different hands, size-wise. Very good price.  Will purchase these again in the future.	1
The best gloves!!!	1
Good to have in my emergency kit	1
Excellent product	1
We've used these for years for all kinds of housework. NOTHING GETS THROUGH THEM.  I keep a few pairs in my desk at school in case a student has a bloody nose or gets sick.	1
Got five good years of daily use out of this and excellent dental check-ups. Alas, now the stem is loose. Although it works the same for brushing, a loose stem of which I see no solution. Of course, this happens only after I stocked up on those expensive brush heads planned obsolescence. In any case, I will be looking for another lithium-powered Sonicare in the near future.	1
I give this 5 stars if I did not make a mistake in ordering the wrong size... I wear a nedium and I mistakenly clicked on the small size.  These are my forever gloves.  I have to have them in my bathroom for daily use... I order THIS brand and type of glove for my needs.  They are my "Forever" gloves and when I order the Medium sized... they will get a 5 STAR rating.	1
great fit - easy off and on	1
Just as represented  haven't had to use it yet  but is in my trauma kit  ALWAYS	1
Excellent quality vinyl gloves. And affordable too. I actually like them better then the brand I use @ work. Very happy I purchased a box for my nursing bag. I will continue to order them. Thx.	1
My husband has large hands and the "one size fits all" vinyl gloves end up ripping when he uses them. These are the only ones that fit and they are relatively durable. He uses them when he works on the car, cleans the bird feeders, handles raw meat, etc.	1
This is a nice glove, and plenty thick enough for what I use it for.  I also really like the color.  I will be purchasing this item again.	1
I bought these gloves for my mother, but will also order for myself later on. These came in blue and were very easy to put on compared to previous ones. I did order a size medium, which is the size of my winter gloves.  And, for the ladies, the gloves look dressy on my hands.  But, I only use these gloves to keep hands safe when using bug sprays or strong chemicals. When I think about it, if they came in black, they would be good to wear on public transportation, especially in the subway system to keep hands germ free. Even though, you may get some funny looks!	1
will order again	1
These gloves stretch so they go on comfortably and they come off easy;  you get 100 pairs of gloves to a box	1
They appear to be as advertised.	1
Good supply for use. Nice packaging and pricing was OK. I have it in my workshop for stained glass work but also use them for painting, etc.	1
The best mechanical toothbrush on the market.  Does a great job.  I have tried them all and this one is the winner.  Thanks	1
I've been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years and the last one failed after a year.  I called Phillips and they sent a replacement and a return shipping container.  Good customer service.	1
A good way to clean your teeth. Slim design help you to hold better and the vibration is quite strong. I like it a lot.	1
Excellent and durable brush. Heads need changing every 2-3 months. Reminder to use less pressure than normal toothbrush or gum recession / sensitivity can happen.	1
I bought a box of extra large gloves and a box of mediums for my mom. We use them every time we handle meat or hot peppers. They are powder free, add no flavor to the food and are easy to put on.	1
This is the one that works. We even take it on trips with us all over.	1
These are fine for protecting hands while washing dishes or doing hobby work. I wish I had bought the next-larger size, though; they are barely big enough for me (a 5-foot-5-inch woman, not big-boned) and too small for other family members to use.	1
I've been using the sonicate series of toothbrush units for almost 10-years and I'm convinced they have saved me from a lot of cavities and improved my overall  oral hygiene.  Now, I will say that if you get 18-24 months out of one of these then consider yourself lucky.  That's just the way it is with today's technology and I'm okay with that.  Highly recommended!	1
This is the next best thing to a dentist cleaning. It is a wonderful very effective toothbrush. My teeth feel like I just had them cleaned every single time I brush. Highly recommend this product. My dentist says there is a big difference in the plaque on my teeth between visits.....almost none. Love this and will own one for life.	1
<div id="video-block-RRCUCMJXGZGCL" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wsuy0TobS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UwZoN1upS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">I am very grateful to other reviewers for indicating that these gloves run small. I want to confirm this recommendation.  I have small hands and normally always wear small gloves. However this time I ordered medium and I was glad I did. I am attaching several photos to show how the glove fits my hand.  The glove is  tight in the palm area (you can see the photo shows it stretched and taught). When I make a fist I feel resistance. The finger tips of this medium size glove are bit too long, the second picture shows me holding my hand in the glove against the box so you can see the extra material folding over at the tips.  This is not too bad, and will not interfere with the kind of work I plan to use them for.  The glove material is thicker than the gloves I used before, which is good. I did not detect strong ordor either on the gloves or on my hands after I removed them. I was able to put the gloves on and off a few times for the photo, they became a little harder to put on with each use (less slippery).  Even though these gloves are powder free there was something on the inside of the glove that made it easier to put on the first time.  Overall, I am pleased with the gloves and so glad there were reviews that helped me pick the right size!	1
If you order the medium be careful as these are small but I have small hands so it is OK for me.  But I would have liked for these to have been available for others to use.  If you have small hands but your fingers are large around they probably won't fit.  The small must be for children.  These are thin and when putting them on I put a small stretched opening at the bottom but you just have to be careful.  I actually purchased these for bird-flu and other serious emergency viral issues.	1
These SafeTouch Exam Gloves are very good quality and sized correctly, at least the "Medium" sized ones are. We have been restocking and augmenting our home first aid kit so decided to add non-latex gloves to handle the "icky" things that occasionally occur.  We have also used these gloves when working on craft projects using stains and varnish. These are thick enough to protect your hands but thin enough to still give your fingers sensitivity.  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
My flexcare was only a few months out of warranty when it stopped working.  Contacted customer service and they said I couldn't send it for repair, but I could buy a new one from their on line store with a 15% discount.  When I pointed out that it was still more $ than what I could buy here on Amazon, they abruptly ended the chat session.  The guys name was Allen and I've never encountered such horrible service.  From reading the other reviews, that is their typical way of treating customers.  I'll never go back to them.	-1
As a mechanical engineer, "the little things" matter to me.  The cheesy base this comes with slides all over the counte due to the chintzy rubber "anti-skid" pads that Sonicare chose to specify in order to save 2 cents per brush.  I had some small, clear, 3M rubber pads on hand and solved the problem, after cleaning the base with rubbing alcohol.  Why should I have to do this with a toothbrush in this price level?  My original Sonicare's base remained in place for a decade.  It also used a "plastic ring design that made reinserting the brush into the charging pad a cinch. Not so with this one, which uses a relatively tiny charging "male" that inserts into the female base of the brush.  This brush offers five different brushing routines, but isn't "smart" enough to remember the last chosen setting.  Hence, it must be reset each time you brush unless the default setting is your preferred setting.  Additionally, the mode select switch (silver color) is poorly positioned and is prone to being inadvertently switched to another brushing mode during use.  A well designed brush would include a "lock" for the mode select switch, which would "remember" and lock the last setting and require 5 - 10 seconds of continuous pressing prior to being unlocked.  This brush is not a well thought out and thoroughly engineered product and I'm thinking about returning it.  People should be fired for this.	-1
At the recommendation of my dental hygienist, I bought this Sonicare toothbrush a year and a half ago.  I find it definitely more effective than a regular toothbrush.  Also easier and maybe quicker to get the job done.  The vibrating head was a little hard to get used to at first, but I adapted soon enough.  This particular model has a lot of settings, but I only ever used two of them (Clean and Sensitive).  So, for me, the other features were wasted.  Next time, I'll get a simpler model.  And the next time will be soon, because recently the indicator lights that show which setting the toothbrush is in went out one by one.  The brush still works, but telling which mode it is in has become a problem.  It's also begun to jump between settings on its own while in use.  I guess a year and a half is a pretty good run, although for the price I expected it to last longer.  In any case, the Sonicare vibrating toothbrush system is so effective that I will surely get a (simpler) replacement.	1
I just bought my second one.  The first was purchased Sept 2009. The trick to a long life is do NOT store it on the charger.  ONLY charge rechargables when the battery requires it.  This will extend battery life dramatically.	1
You know these are the very best things going. If you want clean white teeth then you have to get one of these. I've been using Sonicare for many years and I'm sold. This new smaller head is perfect.  I will never buy anything else.	1
I think the toothbrush is great.  I like that it has a one minute and two minute brush settings and also the easy mode.  My disappointment is that when the battery wears out then you must throw it away.  It would be nice to be able to replace the battery.  It does a great job of brushing without hurting your gums.  Make sure NOT to keep it plugged in all the time.	1
I have had several of these toothbrushes both for me and for my husband. The head barely vibrates now and even when you turn it on and put it under water, it doesn't move the water. I tried turning it on and putting it on my hand. It makes noise but doesn't vibrate anymore. I called the company and they said it had turned 2 years old so I'm on my own. I have bought several of these and the vibration to clean my teeth is minimal, very disappointed especailly for the price of these. dee	-1
I tried the Sonicare and was really surprised by how powerful it is....even in the the "sensitive" setting. This just seems like too much. Saving time brushing will usually mean you are brushing too hard, and likely cause gum recession and tooth abrasion. You need to brush softly, but for between 2-3 minutes, 2-3 times/day (as well as flossing, which nothing can replace). "No pain, no gain," does NOT apply to toothbrushing. I certainly would not recommend this for your teeth. I think if they can tone it down 75%, it might actually be good. The gum "massager," mode makes no sense. Proper tooth and gingival care has more to do with the prevention of accumulation of plaque, etc., and "massaging," the gum is just a great marketing idea. I think the only people who really need to use an electric toothbrush are those with dexterity issues, etc., and they may benefit from the use of an electric toothbrush, but the trade off, e.g. recession, etc., may not be worth it. Also, you can't really try to put less pressure on it, because then it will not clean that well. I can also tell you that you will spurt toothpaste all over unless you wait to turn it on when it is in your mouth...the vibration is just that harsh. If you accidently hit your tooth with it, and you will, you will feel like there is a jackhammer in your mouth! I know there are a lot of people out there who are huge fans of these....I am not one of them. If you are still considering this item.....You only get one head, so if you want to share this (if you are a fan) you will have to spend more on another head. It does come with different colored rings so you can identify different brushes, but those rings slip around, perhaps because of the harsh vibration (I pressed pretty hard to put the two pieces together). The actual quality is very good, and it feels sturdy and not cheaply made. I just cannot recommend something that makes my teeth hurt after using it, no matter how it feels, or how cool it looks (and it does look pretty cool and hi-tech). For about two-three percent of the cost of the Sonicare (and no operating cost) you can have a superior instrument to keep your teeth and gums healthy.	-1
I've been using an older Sonicare model, the "Essence 5300" on which the switch was beginning to go out.  I decided to upgrade to a Flexcare model and am very glad I did.  The Flexcare has been a great improvement all around.  Pros:  -New Lighter, Slimmer Handle This is probably the first thing you'll notice if you're coming from an older Sonicare handle, and it is a very welcome improvement.  The FlexCare handle is small and feels much better in the hand than my old bulky 5300 handle.  The unit is actually longer than my old brush, but that's not a big deal at all.  -New ProResults Brush Head system The new heads are great.  Sonicare moved the tuning fork from the head to the handle, which means smaller brush heads than on the old models.  A 3 pack of the new heads is the same price as a 2 pack of the old heads, making them actually a better deal for a superior product.  -No More Crud in the Handle! The biggest problem with my old brush was that old toothpaste/drool/water tended to collected in the space where the handle connects to the brush head.  It would get all moldy and gross if you didn't clean it out regularly.  Thankfully, this problem is completely gone with the Flexcare handles.  -Lithium Ion Batteries I've waited a long time for Sonicare to upgrade from inferior NiCd batteries, and they finally have.  With Lithium Ion, you don't have to worry about battery capacity decreasing over time, or a memory effect.  The new batteries charge faster, too.  -Quadpacer This is basically a beep that goes off every 30 seconds while brushing, reminding you to switch to a new area of your mouth.  It has appeared in previous models (not my 5300 though), and is nice if you'll use it, but I tend to go at my own pace as I focus more on problem areas in my mouth and less on others.  -5 Total Brushing Modes/Routines There are 3 selectable "modes": clean mode: (2 minutes broken into 30 second segments), sensitive (a "gentler" clean mode) and massage (the brush pulsates for gum stimulation).  Go Care Routine shortines the standard 2 minute clean mode to 1 minute, while Max Care is a longer, 3 minute cycle that includes both clean and massage mode.  I set the brush on clean mode and tend not to use the other options, but some may find them useful.  -More Environmentally Friendly Although buying a new product of any sort will always have a negative environmental footprint, these new brushes are better than the old models due to their Li-Ion batteries, reduced bulk, and lower waste in the smaller replacement brush heads.  Cons:  -Price Let's be clear on this: a Sonicare toothbrush is a luxury product.  You're paying a lot more up front, and you get to keep paying more every time you buy replacement heads.  Surprisingly, heads for Flexcare units are actually a cheaper than the older models; you get 3 Flexcare heads for the same price as 2 of the old heads.  The per head price is still several times what it would cost to buy a new manual brush; but for me the superior cleaning is worth it.  Noise -Flexcare models are louder than older models.  I'm not sure why this is, and supposedly vibration has been reduced in exchange, but the noise can be too much for some.  The UV sanitizer also makes a quiet electric "hum" when plugged in with the door closed, even if the UV bulb isn't run.  -Buttons can be depressed while brushing A couple of people have complained about accidentally hitting 1 of the 2 buttons on the handle while brushing.  It hasn't happened to me, but for completeness I'll include this as a possible con.  Overall:  This brush is a vast improvement over my previous brush, and has fixed most of the problems I had without introducing any significant new ones.  The fact that replacement brush heads are actually cheaper than on my old brush is a big plus.  I highly recommend the Flexcare brushes as a great upgrade to any toothbrush, electric or manual, that you're currently using.	1
I have owned various Sonicare toothbrushes over the years.  My dentist originally recommended it.  I noticed a vast improvement in my gums and brushing from the beginning.  And so did my dentist.  This latest model I find to be even better.  It is easier to hold and maneuver and the increased brushing power is noticeable.  What I like about this product.... you are 'forced' to brush for two minutes.  Now granted this model does give you a 'quickie' option, but unless you are really in a hurry why would you use it, when the 2-minute brushing is the recommended way to go?  I like the smaller charging unit.  I also really like the new way the brush heads attach.  The older models screwed onto the base unit and invariable you needed to often unscrew the brush and clean where the two attached.  Water/dirt ALWAYS accumulated.  This new model just pops right onto the base....no place for water/dirt/toothpaste to gather.  What I don't like about this model, and it is really a minor annoyance, is that you can easily while brushing hit the buttons and cause the brush to shut off.  All in all a great improvement to a great product.  My teeth are happy and so is my dentist.  I highly recommend this product.  It does exactly what it says and more.	1
Short and simple: This fantastic brush is just like the other Sonicares but without the screw-on design flaw of the other Sonicare models. The other models, which are still being sold everywhere, have this hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the brush which pool up in a really disgusting way. This new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic just like the older one.	1
I have used an Oral-B sonic toothbrush for several years.  I have been quite happy with the results I get from it.  I wondered whether there is something better so I selected this toothbrush.  Quite simply, I am amazed.  The first thing I noticed is that this toothbrush is lighter.  Second, the head has a thinner stem than my current toothbrush, making it easier to maneuver around my mouth.  Third, the toothbrush seems to hold a charge longer than my current toothbrush, and it seems to hold one longer than when my current toothbrush was new.  Fourth, this thing is loaded with settings.  This toothbrush features three two-minute cleaning modes that are selectable from the handle.  The most vigorous mode is "Clean," followed by "Sensitive," and then "Massage."  As you are going through the routine, a beep sounds every thirty seconds to let you know to move to another quadrant in your mouth.  The toothbrush shuts off automatically at the end of these modes.  Two other modes serve other purposes.  GoCare is a one minute routine for quick cleanings between regular brushing.  MaxCare features a two minute "Clean" period followed by a one minute "Massage" period.  I like this brushing mode the best.  Some people may find the various modes to be overkill.  I personally like the MaxCare feature and the ability to choose between "Clean" and "Sensitive."  Those choices may not seem like a big deal until you have oral surgery.  I do not use all the modes, but who knows, some day I might.  The Good:  Easy to maneuver around your mouth with the slender head.  The charge lasts a long time.  This model has lots of features.  The Bad:  Whoa!  This model is expensive.  Most sonic toothbrushes are expensive when compared to your typical manual toothbrush, but this one seems expensive for what you get.  I confess that I really like this model, but I struggle with the price.  Also, all that money and only one brush?  Wait until you see how much replacement brushes cost!  There are a lot of ways to brush your teeth.  Sonic toothbrushes are nice because they help massage your gums in addition to cleaning your teeth.  The built-in timer is nice too.  However, you have to justify spending quite a lot on this model, and then spending even more on replacement heads.  I love this model and will use it until it breaks, but I doubt I will purchase anything as fancy (read expensive) to replace it.  The four stars are for the features.  It would have been five stars but for the price.  Good luck!	1
I love this toothbrush. One thing that really made the difference for me is the fact that there is significantly less vibration that other products I've used so far. Believe me, I love the tickle I get from holding the brush handles of my Ultreo Ultrasound, but after a while it gets irritating. What the makers of FlexCare have accomplished is to practically eliminate this buzzing in their product (by as much as 80% according to the statement on the box).  Another interesting feature has to do with the bristles. I feel like I'm reaching some parts of my mouth a lot easier and I believe it has to do with the fact that FlexCare offers a wider sweeping motion and the bristles are more rounded than the average toothbrush. This combination makes for a more pleasant experience when after turning off the bathroom light and heading to bed, I feel refreshed. I guess the toothbrush does make a difference.  I highly recommend it.	1
This is the third electric toothbrush I have tried in the last year and this one stands heads and shoulders over the other two.  The first I tried was the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ultreo-Ultrasound-Toothbrush/dp/B000V4O1UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush</a>&nbsp;which always felt awkward and replacement heads were expensive and not in my local stores.  On the other hand, the Phillips Sonicare just seemed to fit the first time.  Perhaps I am more adjusted to the feel of electric toothbrushes, but this one did not feel like I was brushing with a tennis racket.  Also, replacement brushes are readily available and reasonably priced.  The second brush I tried was the cheaper&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Waterpik-Sensonic-Professional-Toothbrush/dp/B00132FUNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush</a>, which I was very happy with it.  But a few friends kept raving about their Sonicares so I figured I better try one. The Sonicare probably costs twice what the Waterpik costs but it's worth it.  It was kind of like driving a BMW when you are used to driving a PT Cruiser.  The Waterpik was good and got the job done, but this brush just had a feel of quality.  This brush also has some great features, like the quick brushing, and although I didn't try it, there was a setting to ease new users into the world of electric toothbrushes. I have to say I'm am not that into the whistles and bells, I just wanted my teeth brushed, and I feel this brush was noticibly better than the other two.  It's a well constructed, effective brush and my first recomendation to anyone looking for a brush. If you want a cheaper brush, I was happy with the Waterpik, but I would lean toward spending the extra.	1
I've tried just about every electronic toothbrush on the market (Sonicare Elite, Braun, Ultreo, and Waterpik), and the new Sonicare Flexcare beats them all.  Why?  1.  Using the regular setting for a two-minute brush leaves my teeth feeling clean, the cleanest of any of the brushes I've tried.  2. Multiple power settings include a low power gum massage that's just great.  This massage feels as though it stimulates blood flow to the gums, and that just has to be helpful.  3. Plus, for new users, there's an Easy Start program built into the brush that allows the brush speed to start slow and increase in power over several days.  For users familiar with electronic brushes, however, starting with the regular (full power) setting won't be a problem.  4. The charger is solid and heavy enough to avoid the tipping over problems I've experienced with some other brushes.  And there's a place to conceal the excess wiring beneath the charger.  5. The replacement brushes are reasonably priced.  I won't be spending the price of a new setup every year just to get new brush heads.  And I appreciate the fact that Phillips is not holding their customers hostage for replacement brush heads.  All in all, the new Flexcare is just about perfect.  I highly recommend it!	1
I think those who are looking for a lighter weight and smaller diameter handle will be pleased with this version. It cleans as well as the regular Sonicare, although it took me a few sessions to get used to less force and less time in brushing (I have the E9800)while using the initial program setting. This is also a very good brush for those w/ gum erosion or sensitive teeth. Since you can get the one w/ the santizer for only $10 more, I'd suggest that combo. I also have the regular Sonicare santizer which works well, but it also costs around $50, so the combo listed here is a better deal. I really think Philips has overtaken the electric toothbrush market for a few good reasons-quality brushes, desired features, durability, easy to find replacement heads, and THEY ARE the one brand recommended by the 2 different dentists' offices I have gone to in the past year.	1
Product was as described and arrived on time.  I'm happy:):)	1
as expected.	1
Cleans you teeth better than any other toothpaste	1
These filters replace the original John Deere part and work very well.  Another chance to save a bit here and there always helps.	1
ok	1
as described.	1
this matched up with my old filter on my Craftsman garden tractor.	1
Not really, but you can't beat the price here on Amazon. My mower is on it last leg, but the motor still running. Only thing, I wish these were even cheaper because I go through a lot of these. With higher heat and no rain these last several years, it's turned into a dust bowl here with an occasional weed here and there. Snake to frogs is all I get to mow these days. AND my most favorite, doggie turds. And I mean BIG DOGS. You hit one of those in the yard and the whole neighbor hood knows it.	1
Covered surgical site, stayed in place.	1
as described...	1
I bought these for my House Keeper since I'm very concerned about cleaning. I also got these for my nurse when I was home cared and she used them too.	1
Okay, let me start by saying that the H681 is a sound piece of equipment.  The volume is great and the sound quality is pretty good and I've put several hours on the thing without incident (technologically speaking).  The power switch is also easily accessible while wearing this and the volume controls (though they initially felt backwards to me) are easy to access and press simultaneously for call waiting.  However.  The usability for this headset is completely DESTROYED by the fact that there is no way to swivel the piece to point toward (or at least parallel to) your cheek.  So unless it fits you perfectly from go, you are going to have problems.  Not only will you look like a d-bag for wearing one of these things in most contexts, but you will look like a COMPLETE TOOL because the thing wanders away from your face and sticks out away from your head!  It looks totally ridiculous and is even more frustrating when you throw a pair of glasses or sunglasses into the equation.  Look forward to pushing this thing back toward your head every time you want to make a call.  The simple fact is, instead of making a somewhat adjustable piece to go over the ear, they made it out of a solid straw of plastic.  And that, my friends, has compelled me to go buy one that is more adjustable.  It's a terrible waste, considering the quality of the headset otherwise seems very good.	-1
KIMWIPES are the ONLY thing I will use and the only thing most professional people use for delicate cleaning.  If you need to clean the eyepiece of a microscope at a lab, trust me, you will be tossed out the window if you were to fog it up with your breath and use your shirt to wipe it off.  NO, they usually use plain water and kimwipes.  This holds true for just about every other situation like this, telescopes, cameras, whatever.  I use them at home for my eyeglasses,  binoculars, and similar.  I have recently discovered the utility and effectiveness of them in cleaning CD's.  Bottom line, kimwipes are the only, or one of the only optical grade disposable tissue.  They leave little or no "lint" behind, and do not scratch the glass or more importantly damage the delicate coatings.	1
This is a good product but what is there to say about it. It's just ridiculous that you have to type so many words about a product that you have nothing to say about.	1
I use these for my glasses, camera lenses, computer screens, and sensitive optical surfaces. They're great for everything from scientific use to every day home use.	1
I don't know why but these clean better than tissue for eyeglasses, personal electronics, etc. Good stuff.	1
The door/switch assembly is a bit tricky to install but not difficult.  It works perfectly, and my pressure switch locks firmly in place.	1
Works great	1
Streamlight products always have worked well for me, when I use them. This item was no different. Excellent addition to the Streamlight Light that I am using. Great quality at a decent price.	1
That's my only beef with this.  If you need to put a tape switch on a. Streamlight TLR, this is your only option.  Fot what you pay for a TLR-H, they could add a few bucks to the price of the light and just make this standard.  That said, they work (I have 2).  The weak link in the setup is and always will be the tape switch itself.  This replacement door is built with Streamlight's usual quality but I just think its overpriced, so ding 1 star for that.	1
Returned this because I didn't like that the pressure pad had to always be pushed to have the light on.	-1
I use this with the switch and TLR of course. It was just slightly difficult installing on the TLR but when done carefully, shouldn't cause many problems.	1
Great option for those who want to utilize the remote pressure switch that is offered by streamlight. I installed this on my Streamlight TL-1s light, to again...utilize the remote pressure switch that I bought for my home defense weapon. The remote works great.... however... I would recommend that you get a punch set to use for installation. The reason why I say this, is because this remote literally has one vital piece that needs to be removed and re-installed, which is the tiny roll type pin that is the hinge for the "door/switch" that is actually being replaced. Just take a very small punch, and carefully and patiently tap out this pin. As soon as this pin is out, just line up the new remote door, and carefully re-install this pin. After that, its just a simple metal latch underneath, and installation is complete.	1
I don't know why people need to overcomplicate the installation of this product. There are instructions on the Streamlight site if needed and they are step by step. You push out the pin, remove the old door. Put the new door in place and reinsert the pin. No, the rubber cap is not tethered. No filing or fitting is required. Just a little patience.  The door works fine with the Streamlight remote switch, however, there is only a momentary position and not a light locked on position. So there is not full remote control of the TLR-1, TLR-2 or s counterparts. My personal use dictates momentary on rather than constant illumination so it works well for me. I can hold the light on steady or have it stop as needed.	1
MArtyr makes great zincs I highly recommend them	1
I use this as a sacrificial anode in a saltwater pool.  It appears to be working great after several months.  It has corrosion on it but none of the pool hardware shows any.	1
It's a chain and it's safe!!!	1
Nice	1
I sail a "small" boat offshore and feel I need a device to navigate with should for whatever reason GPS not be available.  I just wanted something to take sun sights, and the Davis Mark 3, can do better than that.	1
This is and excellent choice for learning, for backup, for occasional practice and even serious navigation. Its beauty is its simplicity. Very easy to use and to adjust if necessary. The "down side" commonly mentioned is its accuracy, but the accuracy of most very expensive sextants is far overblown. Yes those fancy metal sextants are more accurate, but the results you get from them will only be as accurate as the conditions, the visual acuity, and the skills of the user permit.  Visual acuity is a big one. The human eye only resolves to about 1 to 2 arc-minutes and that is why expensive sextants require telescopes of various magnification. You won't realize the full accuracy of a "fancy" sextant using only your naked eye because you can't see stuff that small. You must magnify the image. But that has its down side as well. It is harder to get a bright image the more you magnify it, so "star scopes" used in the dim light of twilight run around 3X while "Sun scopes" run around 7X. Next there is the issue of keeping the target body steady in the field of view while on a moving vessel. The more you magnify the image the more it bounces around... so a 7X scope is always a challenge to use on a yacht, truly effective only in smooth water even though you think your 7X binoculars are just dandy.  The 3X or 4X scopes are better, but still difficult in rough conditions. So even the best sextants often use 0X sight tubes on tough days, at which point the angular resolution of your human eye (roughly 1 to 2 arc minute)  renders any and all of them to be about the same accuracy achievable with this sextant (2 arc minute markings on the vernier, readable to 1 arc minute if  you practice)   Bottom line: From a practical sense you won't loose any appreciable accuracy by choosing this sextant unless you practice cel-nav daily, have a very steady platform from which to make your sights, have a day with clear atmosphere and calm seas rendering a sharp views of the body and horizon, use a magnifying scope of good optical quality which has been mounted correctly, and take several good sights which you then average out using advanced techniques to account for the distance the vessel moved between individual sights. Only after you can check off every item on that list can it be said that this sextant may not be the best tool for the job on that day.  Now that the accuracy myth is debunked there are huge up-sides to this sextant It is inexpensive, so it is not hard to justify the purchase and no worries about bringing it on deck on less than perfect days. It is light to hold which makes it easy to take a full round of sights without arm fatigue or a tendency to rush the sights. Heavy is not your friend. It is compact and convenient to transport, which makes it a welcome traveling companion on airlines etc. The entire thing can be slipped into a big ziplock for dust protection, or even for use on a spray swept deck. (sight right through the plastic bag)    You should also look for a decent hard case of some sort in which you can keep this sextant, a scientific calculator, a couple of folded up plotting sheets, pad, pencils, dividers, parallel rule, protractor or plotter, almanac and compact tables. (H.O. 208 preferred) The whole kit can then be self contained and easy to grab either for practice or emergency. (Edit: Some users report using a large tupperware-container as a waterproof kit-case.)  Be careful with the sun shades. I do not know their actual protective capacity, which is true of every single sextant I have ever seen regardless of price. Not a-one publishes the effectiveness of their shades for protecting your eyes during prolonged observations of the sun!  EDIT: messing about with my Mk 3 today I discovered that if BOTH index shades are used and the orange horizon shade is also in use the image of the sun in the index glass completely disappears! This had me going for a bit because I couldn't seem to get the sun into the index view ! I switched to just one index shade and there it was. Sure enough either index shade with either horizon shade or both horizon shades is OK, but BOTH index shades and the orange horizon shade killed off the index image altogether, even on a brilliant sunny day in the early afternoon.  The motion of the index arm can be improved by careful application of a dry lubricant to the arc and index arm where they rub. You want it to move smoothly, but not too freely. If you use a spary such as SlideAll be sure to cover the mirrors and shades with a towel as you apply it. A finger tip worth of soap rubbed along the appropraiate spots would work as well.  Do not buy the more expensive plastic sextants that look sort of like metal sextants. They are notoriously unreliable or inaccurate. They will not stay in adjustment for two consecutive sights in the same round. Instead your next step up from here is a used Simex (private label Tamaya) in excellent condition with original certificate and a "star scope" not a sun scope, and preferably not one with polarized index shades because once again no one publishes if those are truly safe for prolonged use for sun sights, especially as the polarized shades get older.  With any used sextant skip any examples with signs of corrosion or hard use. Simex sextants were sold by a celestial navigation school in the US so there are plenty of examples around in good, barely used, not crusty, shape. Since the Simex name is not as well know as Tamaya, Freiberger, C. Plath, or Cassens and Plath you can get them for a decent price and they are a quality sextant, IMHO better than the Astra IIIB which is a good choice if you just have to have brand new.  But even if you do buy a very expensive C. Plath  or Cassens and Plath or Feriberger you are still going to want this Davis MK 3  for spray swept days, travel, and emergency... so you may as well buy it to start out with.  EDIT:  I took my Mk3 out for a practice session yesterday (Aug 1, 2017.) I was stationary ashore but had a real sea horizon since I was at the beach. I did a latitude by noon sight and later in the afternoon a sun-moon crossing. My plot was off only 2 nm in latitude and 0.0 nm in longitude... which for an out-of-practice guy is about as good as it ever gets with any sextant regardless of the price. Anyone who claims that this sextant isn't accurate enough for serious navigation is simply wrong.	1
I struggled with the strap arrangement, especially the "safety" strap. It's too short The rear strap slips off the back of the motor. The handle sits so close to the motor top, I can barely get fingers under it. Some metal lifting ring or hook would surely slice up the paint on the top. Good idea I suppose but it did not work for a brand new Merc 8hp 4 stroke motor.	-1
Great product	1
Great	1
Very accurate and inexpensive. I use it along side my full size one and they are within a degree or two of each other. Great for checking the chamber temp for my bolt action	1
Seemingly good quality.	1
Nice bucket for small jobs. It's sturdy and should last a life time with a little TLC. I recommend this bucket.	1
Giving this 1 star because a slightly heavier model is available at my local Home Depot for < $4. I would suggest looking locally for a 2 gal pail since the price/quality of this item is pretty high.  Why did I get this from Amazon? Well I thought for $10 it would be a great heavy duty pail (kind of like the ones I could purchase several years ago).	-1
I have tried several all natural t.pastes and this is just another one I like.  Will probably buy again.  I get good results form most any pastes with Neem in them.  Dental hygeniest complemented me on really doing a good job keeping them clean( I was in/out in 10 min.)	1
Yum!  Great tasting toothpaste.  Doesn't have that overpowering mint flavor.  As a matter of fact, it has no minty flavor; it's mostly spiced with cinnamon and cloves.  My teeth feel so clean after using this toothpaste. Even my kids liked the flavor.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive; otherwise, I'd purchase regularly.	1
Most excellent toothpaste I have ever used. After two weeks, my bleeding gums were now healthy and my bad breath was gone. I also like the flavor (encourages me to use it). Neem is India answer to mouth problems.	1
Good price for this preduct. Will see how long it last. Purchased 4.	1
Very good filter, but cheaper if you buy in bulk	1
Excellent water filter	1
Received as described.	1
excellent	1
Best price for store quality filters! And you get so many (8)!  (on first order at least) But if you reorder they only ship you ONE instead of 8 at the same price.  I used the option of "Buy Again", which should have duplicated my order previously where they sold a qty of 8 filters per package for $11.87, so I ordered two packages expecting to receive a total of 16, but only got TWO filters.	-1
Keeps my water system clear of shmutz	1
Great whole house filter.  We are on a rural well.  We didn't notice any pressure loss.  I replaced it for the first time today after 2 months (4 people in house).  It is definitely doing its job.  It was full of silt all the way into the inner layers near the ~1 micron size.  I installed a 3 stage big blue filter system, followed by a pH neutralizer, and finally a UV system.  The first chamber is a washable 30 micron sediment filter.  I cleaned it out today; it was fairly dirty after 2 months.  The 2nd big blue is this cartridge.  The final big blue is a 10 micron charcoal file.  This filter can't be washed but it's lasted 2 months so far.  I'm planning on ordering another soon so we are prepared if we get a sudden water pressure drop.  I do have by-passes built into the entire filtration system but I only want to use them if necessary.	1
goog product	1
Good cost effective filter for my boat,  costs 5 times more if I buy it from the boat dealer.	1
Quality Product	1
These are great and last me for at least a year. No more sediment in my washing machine filter screen.	1
We have a well water system we have been using the past 14 years. I ordered these filters from Amazon because they were less expensive. These are the identical filters we had been using for years, but paying a higher price for from another source. Will only order from Amazon from now on. They work well and are easy to change out.	1
cheap	1
Perfect! Filters water and does not reduce water pressure  using a 25 and 1 micron combo worked best for performance and not restring water flow	1
A real nice heat shrink assortment.  Good deal.	1
nice kit. good for most large wire. no adhesive inside and could use one more size. overall happy with it.	1
I bought these to work on my daughters jeep and my suburban. They seem nice and useful. the box can be reused as a small parts box.	1
A good selection, the largest size is very big. It is nice to have a large amount of the three basic colors.	1
Geat item, shipped fast. Varible Shink wrap in assorted collors which is what I was looking for and it arrived on time.	1
WIFE LOVEs this STUFF. . . nothing more needs to be said	1
What can you say?  It is Martin.	1
I have used micrometers for over 30 years.  At one time in my career I taught proper use of precision measuring instruments to union workers in a high precision machine shop.  There are better quality products on the market and you probably know the brand names.  The Fowler is a great product for the price.  I bought it for my daughter who is a school teacher that teaches technical subjects to her students.  She uses the Fowler in her class to teach precision measuring to her students.  It has worked flawlessly for her despite being utilized by many unskilled students.	1
Haven't had a chance to use it much, but appears to be accurate and smooth as to the way I use these.	1
Nice inexpensive caliper - not a the most expensive but it snaps right back to zero every time no dial creep [unless its dirty] action is smooth and the measurements accurate - no cheap plastic parts to break - for the price I got more than I paid for - would recommend to anyone..	1
used to order a  bearing for a  motor works great thanks	1
not worth buying, made in china, the needle was broke off when i opened the package.  save your money & buy a brown& sharpe when you can afford it.	-1
Quality caliper great price	1
For the money, this Dial Caliper can't be beat.  Solid steel, put together well and has smooth operation.  I checked it against some other measuring devices and was within 3/10000.  Easy to read dial.  It'll get lots of use around my workshop. The only down side is that it's made in China.	1
Received in good condition and calibrated after it acclimated. It was spot on and for the price, has been a great tool that does what's it's supposed to do.	1
I use calipers for reloading and I like to have a couple on hand to do different tasks. I am pleased with this caliper, the overall quality is good. I checked it against my "older" Browne & Sharpe caliper and they both read the same. It is not quite as smooth as my B&S but it is accurate and consistent.	1
Really nice Dial Caliper. I use it in locksmithing, measuring keys, tumblers, locks, ect. Easy to use, Do not drop it,	1
Out of the box it was stiff in operation. I played with the spring plate adjustment and found the right tension. It now moves smooth from 0 to 5 inches with the last inch a little tight. After using it a couple of weeks almost every day I found the Fowler to be quite good. Probably the best bang for the buck. I have recently tried Harbor Freight at $18 and it was junk. I next tried a Tekton 7155 at $21 and it was just ok. For the Fowler 72-008-706 at $35, I would call it a best buy. I doubt if a $70 caliper could be much better. There is/was 2 slight problems. 1. The indicator plate at 0 is slightly right of 0, no problem. 2. The thumb wheel was slightly cocked and would have a binding feel. If I didn't have to drill out the bracket that holds the wheel and put it in alignment, I would have given it a 5.	1
Geat item, shipped fast. Fasteners came in a varible settings which is what I was looking for and it arrived on time.	1
This kit came with everything as described and I've used it extensively for various automotive wiring projects.  I'll probably just buy packs of what I run out of as needed to refill this kit, but it is a fantastic starter for the price.  So far, latches and hinges are holding up great.  The case is made of the softer plastic instead of the really hard stuff that breaks easily.	1
Works well.	1
They work well. I pull the plastic down, solder my connections, then pull the plastic back up and finish the job with shrink tubing. Some you can move the plastic, others you can't.	1
Nice quality set of terminals, nothing to complain about, much less costly than those little packs from the store. Just realize and study carefully what is included. Some you may never ever have any use for, and some you really need may not be included. So, do the math, its still a super deal even if half you have no use for.	1
Best buy!	1
These connectors are worth the price.  Nice amount to choose from in different sizes, and they crimp down well. I highly recommend.	1
Thay aire good	1
Great product...highly recommend	1
A very big must if you do any electrical work on vehicals. Great deal for so many connectors	1
As described, hard to find item in "conventional channel", as 'price higher algorithms' squat the shelfs../	1
This is a nice kit, with a lot of variety, that I've used to make several repairs.  I can't speak to the quality of these compared to other brands, but I haven't had any of the insulation crack or fail on me so far, and I have these installed in several repaired small appliances around our home.	1
All is good	1
thank you	1
A lot of various connections that you might one day need for a small amount of money. For most of us, this is a "Just in Case" purchase.	1
you have to have these around the shop..	1
cheap Chinese product. When you crimp the ends on your wires they pull apart easy...buy better quality..American if you can find it....	-1
Fantastic product I want to thank the seller	1
Haven't used it yet but great price	1
Good value for the dollar, but the insulation is hard plastic, not plyable nylon.	1
These terminals will prove to be quite useful.  They contain a wide variety of connectors,  many much more inexspensive than buying them separate.  I would recommend these to anyone.	1
A real nice assortment of connectors.  Good deal.	1
Great to do business with fast on shipping and handling ..I work on a lot of ride on cars or battery operator cars and this box has everything i need for any elect. fitting	1
Nothing special, nothing bad. Good selection. No problems with any pieces I've used so far. Just handy to have around.	1
These are great for automotive work.  I keep a box in my truck, and have used them on a dozen different projects.  No failures so far.	1
If you require a large assortment of solderless connectors for DC electrical work I suggest buying this set. For the most part all of Neiko's products are excellent quality. In fact If I am looking for tools and accessories I always look to see if Neiko offers those tools. I have never gone wrong with their tools or accessories.	1
They do work,and are grabby.	1
Yellow Jacket products are usually a top quality product and these ball valves were no exception.  They looked and performed perfect so far.	1
Best thing about these is their quality Inexpensive and work great make sure you tighten but not overtigten when using each time only drawback is nothing imprinted on brass fitting for open or closed position on valves fit my JB manifold gauges fine good shipping would buy again	1
It's yellow jacket.  Nothing else needs said	1
works well for all My A/c	1
work excellent goo quality	1
Nice, small, compact ball valve attachments for my manifold hoses.  The usual high quality I have come to expect from Yellow Jacket. You can't go wrong with these.	1
Works okay.	1
Excellent quality . Less of hassle when moving gage and vacuum hoses around .	1
Worked great. Glad I added these to my hoses.	1
Had to have on my new manifold gauges which did not come with them. They have been working fine.	1
Items as desribed.	1
It worked perfectly, I'm very satisfied, great buy!	1
works good	1
came off in a week  wast of my time and money	-1
I have used thI before and it works great.  The smaller foll is handy for a household repair kit.	1
Works great.	1
good product good service	1
Great Product! I love the products this company makes and will continue to buy them.	1
Classic duct tape for a cheap price	1
Perfect!	1
Great for Halloween.	1
Heavier plastic than I expected...about the thickness of a heavy-duty kitchen trashbag. Looks great!	1
Excellent Halloween	1
sturdy. reusable.	1
super, great for blocking off areas at bday party	1
This is an outstanding toy for young folks that have some creativity, and could use a way to express it. I can see future engineers having a blast with this. The only thing I would add, and we can do it ourselves, is a ball of string. There are structures where some string will extend the type of structures that are possible. Hey, look at those new bridges out there...	1
Work well, could be sharper.	1
A must own for DIY framers. Used to use an oversize channel lock and a rubber pad. This is one smart tool. Cost effective.	1
it worked	1
Great quality (more so than the previous batch I bought). Very reasonable price and good packaging too.	1
Kick Butt tough. What I have learned is that you CAN NOT be gentle with this in any way. This auger takes brute strength and persistence. Ram the auger with all you've got to get it through the bends in your toilet. A turn on the handle could help. You will know when your through the toilet. NOW crank the handle. If you feel it binding up, it is recommended that you pull the auger, rather than trying to push forward. I recommend the you try YOUTUBE for other help.	1
This product was just what I needed to remove a stubborn clog from my toilet.  I had previously tried a plunger and a lightweight snake to do so, but they were ineffective.  Within a minute using this toilet auger I removed the clog and avoided the cost of having to call a plumber to do the job. An excellent tool for anyone with a similar problem and well worth the price.	1
very strong tape	1
Well made stethoscope with a nice option for tracking down vacuum leaks.  Excellent sound transfer.  Durable and flexible hoses.  Easy to use.	1
A bit pricey but handy to have around the garage. Helped me isolate a noisy pulley on a friends car as well as a ticking lifter on my Harley. Paid for itself already	1
How on earth have I been diagnosing automotive and small engine repairs for so long without this? Already handled an under hood squeal, will be using soon to look for a buzz in the front area of my motorcycle. The cone is most useful so far, haven't found a use for the long metal rod. The earpieces are very hard and will hurt your ears if you leave them in long. It won't cut out other noises unless you are able to stick them into your ears a little. Good product, would buy again and already recommended to 2 other purchasers. This is a money saver over having a mechanic guess (a.k.a. throw parts at it).	1
Works fine.  Quality is a little suspect though.	1
Simple and very effective for troubleshooting various noise under the car hood. I can't believe that I didn't get it before.	1
OK, kids like quality but woks just fine	1
Works okay.  Hard to here some noise in pipes which is what I wanted it for.	1
nice tool helped me find the airleaks on my air compressor tank.	1
Perfect diagnostic tool for any moving parts.  Lets you hone in on the sound whereas just listening with your ears would give you only an approximation.  Used on automobiles, small engines, appliances, etc.  Just be careful with your ears, the amplification, as with any stethoscope, is great.	1
Should have bought this long ago!	1
Product is as I expected.	1
Works wells and transports easily. This is much better than the Harbor Fright version and allowed me to find bearing noise on my idler pullies.	1
Works exactly as it's supposed to.  Only complaint would be that the incredible force with which the earpieces push in on your ears makes them feel like they're going to pierce your skull!  I had to bend the metal spring clamp (pretty substantial metal band!) out a significant amount to lessen the force.  Nice quality.  I would recommend this to people for auto troubleshooting - VERY sensitive. (watch your ears - things are LOUD). Wish they provided some kind of storage pouch with it.	1
seems to let me hear everything I want	1
My husband uses this daily in our auto repair shop to pinpoint and identify certain noises coming from a vehicle to aid him in diagnostics and repairs.  This works just as good as a doctor's stethoscope if not better.  Lisle is a brand we trust in our line of work and are never disappointed in the quality or performance of the brand.  This works great and we would purchase again!	1
Works great!	1
Just as expected, helps a lot.	1
Works well.	1
A must have for any diagnostic work. Well made priced right.	1
I bought this to replace my stethoscope from harbor freight.  A very nice improvement.  The listening tube has also come in handy.	1
Works as intended.	1
A stethoscope is a must-have if you're into anything more than just the basics when it comes to auto repair. This set does exactly what you need it to do, and at a reasonable price. A little uncomfortable in the ears, and you need to be careful with the probe once you have them on, as banging it on something can be very, very loud.	1
It worked how I wanted it to.  It was actually a little too loud for my liking, which is a good thing when it comes to a stethoscope of any kind.  It's a standard old design of a cheap stethoscope, so you can probably buy more comfortable ear plugs for this than those that come on it.  I found the stock ear plugs a little bit uncomfortable, but this is my first stethoscope, so that might be normal.	1
Works great, well worth the price.	1
A very good buy for the money.  Bought it mainly to find a rattle in the dashboard of a fairly new SUV.  However, have found other uses for the mechanic's stethoscope in the house, garage, and shop.  Be careful when you put the probe onto a piece of equipment and the ear pieces are in your ears.  It can be LOUD.	1
A little uncomfortable for the ears but works great and it's USA made!! Adjusting the spring to loosen it will help with the comfort somewhat.	1
With a serpintine belt on this vechicle,I couldn't tell what was bearing was wailing and no way to find out,but this pinpointed it right-out for me in a couple of minutes. Using the rod, I touched it to the alternator and there was the bad one,No dought. Please be extra carefull around the moving belt (s) and pulleys. I highly recommend this unit.	1
First off you get what you pay for, maybe. Not even sure at this price it was worth it. Cheap plastic pieces, ear pieces that feel like a bear trap. By bending out the piece of spring "steel" it was made bearable. For occasional use, a few times a year these might suffice. The plastic end pieces were not finished off and had tabs that needed to be cut off. Everything is crammed into a flimsy box. Would not recommend to anyone that wants anything with any quality at all.	-1
Great Deal	1
There's not much to say about these other than I hope that I'll never have to use them. They come in a plastic bag, so do be aware of that if you're hoping for a hard plastic box. That's why the price is so low.	1
Standard set of OPA's. Colors make finding the right size a breeze.	1
Exactly what I needed. I wish it came in the container shown in the photo but theyh only came in a plastic bag. Still okay, just habe to find a case to put them in myself.	1
I'm putting together a first responder kit to keep in my vehicle. I used to be an emt so I think these are essential items to keep on hand	1
got it	1
Works great	1
Good product!	1

EXCELLENT	1
Great product for your GO-BAG!	1
Well made, no rough-spots to injure anyone.	1
Here... I watched the youtube video on how to use these... we don't need no medical professional, trust me.	1
Airway kit shipped out and arrived on time. For the price they are great. But, photo in add shows a plastic box that they come in. Think they should have it, if it's in the add....	1
Nice assortment of sizes in different colors for oral airway issues.  Lightweight plastic.  They come in a nice plastic case with easy visibility.	1
great airways	1
Excelent	1
Great for my Improved First-Aid Kit (IFAK) ...	1
thanks	1
I like how they come in a pack. I keep a few in my IFAK	1
These Oral Airway devices are designed to keep an unconscious persons airways open while keeping the tongue from slipping back into the throat and cutting off the airway further. There are video's online that instruct in the use of these. I will say, I think that It's unfair to see a one star review for these unless they were defective, missing some, or simply broken. However, the picture shows what appears to be a plastic case yet the title says 'poly bag..' which is what they really come in. See pictures for details. Everyone who purchases these hopes that they never have to use them. But in the case that you might, they are a cheap investment.	1
Nice range of sizes for the price.	1
Good value and sized to easily fit into my bag!	1
Great product. Highly recomment	1
Excellent!	1
Recommended by a EMT for my trauma bag. After advanced training, it is a good idea having a set in a field bag even because some first responder may not have these in their field bag. These are not for untrained people.	1
item exactly as dscribed, arrived it time.	1
delivered promptly and as advertised.	1
Based on the other reviews, I have stocked them into a "super-sized" emergency first aid kit.	1
Exactly what I needed. Thanks!	1
Ouu, pretty colors for the pts.	1
Stuck these in my first aid kit, I hope I never have to use them, price was right, and has a good selection of sizes.	1
Purchased this for my trauma bag.  It appears that they will work, but has never been tested and I hope it never will.	1
Can't take them out of the package to feel the edges, of course, but visual inspection tells me they might have a few rough edges from incomplete finishing after being removed from the molds. Can't tell for sure until I need to use them, but as I hope that is NEVER, I'm not going to worry a whole lot about it. Going into the emergency bag, along with a lot of other things I hope never to need.	1
We are a nonprofit tax exempt medical aid and educational agency and this product is perfect for our first aid stations - www. SmartEMS.org	1
Exactly as advertised.	1
Perfect set for my personal response bag!	1
Good addition to a trained person's first aid or trauma kit. Good quality, smooth edges.	1
Good!	1
They appear to be of good quality with no sharp edges viable.  You will have to provide your own storage bag as the bag that they come in is not resealable.	1
Great Product	1
Seems like good quality. I haven't used these and hope I never have to, but I added them to my first aid kit I carry in my car.	1
Airways should be an essential part of every emergency kit. That's why I got these. I haven't had to use them yet, but emergencies do happen and it is best to be prepared for  "just in case." Remember in the CPR courses: Airway, Breathing, Circulation.	1
This ADC Berman Oral airway kit 6 sizes is an important component in any advanced first aid kit. These are good quality and will work as expected if needed. Be sure to get training on their proper use (well worth the investment).  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
It is a set of oral airway. Do not use it often but keep it handy for my office emergencies.	1
No more fiddling around in your first-in bag to see which OPA fits the patient by sizing them up against each other. Just remember the colors and you're on your way to selecting the proper airway fit.	1
For the Emergency supplies and first aid kit these little plumbing pipes keep you from kissing the Blarney stone- if someone konks out on you.  I would recommend that if the patient is female you can save these and go direct connect- more personal touch in that case!.	1
I got these in case I needed help with opening an airway for CPR, but I believe they are for the professionals.  Hope I never have to use them, but am keeping them anyway.	1
Must have for a medical bag. Keeps airway's open and tubes in. I use them in my medical back pack I have ready with everything I need at home for any emergency big or small. If you never used on get some training otherwise you can do some real damage trying to use it on someone.	1
You need to know how to use these airways, but they are super for a comprehensive first aid kit.  I got them for the big bag with other bulky instruments like a stethoscope and blood pressure cuff.  The airways are also individually bagged in the poly bag.  All in clear plastic so you can choose the size you want.  Very well designed instruments.	1
Very grateful for your product, excellent quality, good finish. I appreciate the sale. Keep the quality, please.  Thank you again.	1
Nice to have a complete set of airways in the EMS bag. Would also suggest as a good idea for first responders.	1
sitting in my medical bag for the time that I may need it or provide it to someone who would be able to use it.	1
You can see my reviews that I found another kit I like the best. This item will do just fine though as it is better than nothing.	1
Hace la funcin muy bien, tremendo ayudante para primeros auxilios y tiene una buena gana de tamaos. comprelo con confianza!	1
This is a nice selection of different sized airways.  I bought them to go in my mega first-aid kit.  Please take a first aid class before you even think about buying these.	1
They are oral airways that I plan to throw in my SHTF medic bag. The poly bag is a plastic ziplock, not impressed. But for the cost they will work. As another mentioned, i hope not to need to use the pink one :-(	1
I bought these for my emergency medical kit. My wife is a nurse and these are the ones she said to buy. Multiple sizes for different sized people. Not a bulky item so it doesn't take up a bunch of room	1
This is a great tool to get for paranormal investigation. It's shocking with accurate results. Don't get anything less than this. The Ghost Meter which I bought - it's okay but I prefer this one if your really serious into investigating paranormal.	1
Excellent	1
works great	1
Seems to work. I still need to play with it to get the feel on how to really use it. I originally bought the Ghost Meter. That only regestered in the 50/60Hz range and the dial only went to 5mG. The Ghost meter went off scale where ever I used it. I needed something more accurate. I bought this meter.  There are some high readings I get. The microwave's keypad gives off high readings. I also get a high readng from the LED display on my electric range. The display on my laptop has no response, but I got a response on the monitor for my desktop computer. Then I realized that was coming from the subwoofer I have behing the monitor. The meter was picking up the magnet in the speaker. I also got high readings from the circuit breaker box.  I still have to play with this a bit more. It does seem to be accurate.	1
ITEMS WERE RECIEVED ON TIME--ITEMS WERE EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED--NO PROBLEMS --WILL ORDER AGAIN WHEN NEEDED	1

Review for:  Lutron 822-A Fully Digital EMF Meter  OVERVIEW: -----------  Measures EMF strength of low frequency (30Hz-300Hz in this case) portion of AC MAGNETIC FIELD (NOT AC electric field, too) from ONE AXIS (direction) in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT).  Because cell phones and microwaves are in a much higher frequency range, this product does not measure EMF (RF) at those frequencies.  You would want a separate meter for that.  The Achilles Heal of this instrument is that the design is HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings. The accuracy is not 4% of the displayed value (+ 3 digits) but rather THE ACCURACY IS % OF THE VALUE OF THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT RANGE (4%x200mG = +/-8mG (+ 3 digits).  Since most consumer EMF checking is in the single and low teens mG, this is unfortunate.  This will do fine for noting the EXISTENCE of stronger EMF at lower frequencies, but appears to be a highly inaccurate choice for MEASURING it.  MAIN VALUE: ------------  - Measures EMF at 30Hz-300Hz low frequency range (Magnetic AC field only, not Electric AC Field), which covers most EMF generated by AC power in most homes/offices.  60Hz (U.S.) and much of the EMF generated by resulting harmonic frequencies .. 120Hz (2nd harmonic), 180Hz (3rd), 240Hz (4th), 300Hz (5th).  CONS: ------  - HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings .. a fixed +/- 8.3 milligauss (mG).  Since most suggested defensive limits for extended exposure are 1mG-2mG or so, this greatly limits its utility.  See paragraph above under "The Achilles Heal of this instrument.." for more detail.  - Measures only AC magnetic field (mG/uT), NOT AC ELECTRIC FIELD (V/m,mW/cm2, etc.).  Adding electric field measurement with decent accuracy would have added greatly to the cost.  NOTES: -------  - Like other meters anywhere near this price range, the company doesn't claim this unit will filter out <30Hz and >300MHz EMF as well as academic/professional units like the Enertech Emdex II filters out EMF from outside its measurement range.  - This frequency range does not cover cell phones or cordless phone signals, microwave oven radiation, or other high frequencies often referred to as RF (radio frequency).  SAMPLE EMF MEASUREMENTS: -----------------------------  There is no definitive consensus nor clear epidemiological evidence yet as to how much milligauss (mG) for extended periods could be harmful (within reasonable home/office real world levels).  However, there is a consensus from studies that staying under 1mG-4mG would be a good defensive strategy in case 20-40 years from now longer term studies (think smoking, etc.) start showing stronger causal relationships.  Most folks who care about this aim for under 2mG, preferably under 1mG, especially where pacemakers can be involved.  Here are some sample readings of LOW frequency AC MAGNETIC field EMF (Note: not electric field):  (1) Alarm Clock 3"  25mG 6"  10mG 1'  3mG 1.5'  1.8mG 2'  0.5mG  (2) Microwave Oven #1 (Home) Towards decent seal: 6"  10-30mG 1'  4-25mG 2'  1.5-5mG Towards questionable seal: 6"  160mG 1'  45mG 2'  15mG  (3) Microwave Oven #2 (Office) 6"  50mG 1'  20mG 2'  3mG 3'  1.2mG  (4) CRT Television (20" Sony WEGA) Down the middle: 6"  0.9mG 1'  0.5mG 2'  0.2mG Corners: 6"  5.5mG 1'  3mG 2'  0.7mG Sides/Edges in the middle vertically: 6"  7mG 1'  3.5mG 2'  0.9mG  (5) 2012 LED Television 3"  0.6mG  (6) Dehumidifier (Large 70pt.

Unlike higher frequencies where magnetic and electric fields are strongly coupled together, at lower frequencies you measure them separately.  As noted elsewhere in the review, for biological exposure it is suggested to play defense and keep prolonged exposure from lower frequency Magnetic Fields to under 1-4 mG (preferably under 1-2 mG) but there is no definitive consensus as to the long term biological dangers, and where the safety lines are.  Regarding Electric Fields of 50-60Hz (AC Power), there is some rough consensus out there to keep below 10-20 V/m and sleep at a spot below 5 V/m, though again opinions vary.  5 V/m was the recommendation in Germany and by the IRPA/INIRC for "private individuals", 10 V/m for "workers", with 25 V/m for "workers" for max. 2 hours.  ACGIH recommend 1 V/m for those with pacemakers or other electrically sensitive implants.  The fields in the lower frequency ranges are sometimes referred to as ELF (see chart below for usual acronym meanings of this sort), or even confusingly as EMF which is also often used to define such fields at most frequencies.  EMF(RF) FROM HIGHER FREQUENCIES:  At HIGH FREQUENCIES like those the high frequency meters measure, the magnetic and electric fields are coupled so strongly together that it is one field that is measured, usually in V/m or mW/cm2, etc.  For microwave ovens (2.45 GHz) biological exposure is often recommended to not exceed 5 mW/cm2 (milliwatts per cm squared), however again opinions vary.  Some school or hospital exposure limits for 300MHz-300GHz: - France, Italy 10 mW/cm2 in schools - Switzerland 9.5 mW/cm2 in schools, 4.25 mW/cm2 in hospitals - Belgium, Luxembourg 2.4 mW/cm2  For RF Fields of 900MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 4.5W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.  For RF Fields of 1800MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 9W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.  The higher frequencies are often referred to as RF (radio frequency) frequencies (think cell phones, microwaves, etc.) and thus you'll see some meters with "RF" in the title or description.  MAGNETIC VS. ELECTRIC FIELD MEASUREMENT:  AC MAGNETIC FIELDS are much harder to shield than electric fields.  On the other hand unperturbed AC ELECTRIC FIELDS are much harder to measure accurately/dependably than Magnetic fields.  IEEE tries to help with IEEE 644-1994.  The inexpensive models don't pretend to measure this as well as the Enertech Emdex II's of the world, however they are often much less expensive and there's your trade-off.  Note that AC ELECTRIC FIELDS often remain as long as the the source is plugged in, whether it is turned on or off.  So for biological concern, what do people care about, magnetic or electric fields?  An engineer in the field that has been following this noted that in the 70's it was electric fields, in the late 70's and 80's it was magnetic fields, and now it's really both.  Most inexpensive units are only good for detecting the PRESENCE of stronger fields (vs. measuring them well) and many only measure magnetic fields, and if they do measure electric fields it usually isn't accurate.  If you need to measure accurately and/or measure both magnetic and electric fields, I try to help out in this review with some leads later on.  GENERAL:  Meters not designed for it avoid 0Hz since that is the natural ground DC static field and we usually want to ignore that for measurement.  Also there is often comparatively little EMF produced 1Hz-40Hz (some European train systems do FYI - 16.7Hz).  Thus meters often aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover below 30Hz-40Hz.  The frequency range of 30Hz/40Hz to 300Hz usually covers much of low frequency EMF produced in a home or office.  This includes the U.S. 60 Hz AC power frequency and 4 of the harmonic frequencies from that.  Thus we usually aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover over a few hundred Hz or so.  However, note that capping the upper end of the low frequencies in the low hundreds may fail to capture a good portion of CFL's EMF (compact fluorescent lights) if that is important to you.  Note that measured values can become less trustworthy as you get very close to the source of an EMF field, so measuring practically next to the source is often questionable.  Also note that pulsed EMF is usually not read accurately by EMF meters.  Note that if you need to take high radar frequency field strength into account (think Traffic Control Radar, Aviation, Naval, Military) because say you live near an airport and are wondering .. you'll probably need a meter that reads in the 8.5GHz-9.5GHz range.  Note:  I can't imagine who might work so close to one, but keep CFL bulbs without specific UVB and UVC mitigation (think double-envelope eco bulbs, for example) more than 20cm/8" from people at the bare minimum.  If you don't know the technology of your CFL bulb, might as well play defense.  FREQUENCY USE LEGEND: -------------------------  - Static Field = 0Hz - Some European electric rail = 16.7Hz - Amtrak electric wire driven trains in U.S. southern NE corridor = 25Hz - AC Power for home/business (much of Europe) = 50Hz - AC Power for home/business(U.S.) = 60Hz - U.S. AC Power natural harmonics = 120Hz, 180Hz, 240Hz, 300Hz, 360Hz.. up to 800Hz for most. - 2Hz-100KHz includes many energy saving lamps, switching-mode power supplies, electronic dimmers, and monitors. - Some specialty small/light/fast motors (some server rooms, aircraft, ships, some power tools, etc.) = 400Hz - RF Animal Identification = 125KHz(U.S.) and 134.2KHz(Intl) (penetrates mud, blood, water) - Dect 6.0 cordless phone (most secure, least conflict) = 1.9GHz - Other cordless phones = 900MHz, 2.45GHz, 5.8GHz - WiFi (802.11) = 2.45GHz or 5GHz - Bluetooth = 2.45GHz - Many radio control cars, planes, etc. = 2.45GHz - RFID (Radio Frequency Identification ..

IRPA - International Radiation Protection Association SCENIHR - Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (European Union advisory group). INIRC - International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee ICNIRP - International Commission on Nonionizing Radiation Protection WHO - World Health Organization International EMF Project U.S. EMF RAPID Program - 6 year working group put together in the past by NIEHS, NIH, and DOE. NRC/NAS - National Research Council / National Academy of Sciences by way of National Academy Press CA Dept. of Health Services - CA EMF Program IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers VDB - Association of German Building Biologists (Verband Deutscher Baubiologen)  Further future related research discoveries are likely to involve, or at least be reported on, by one or more of these organizations as they have been involved in such research in the past (much of it you can find on the web).  HOW TO GET 3D READINGS FROM FROM 3 XYZ AXES METER READINGS: ------------------------------------  While some tools take "3D" readings, to save money some folks buy meters that read 1 or 3 individual axes, not a composite "3D" reading.  To make a "3D" reading out of the individual axes readings you are supposed to put each of the three axis meter readings into the equation "square root (x-squared + y-squared + z-squared)".  However, here are some short-cut estimations for less demanding needs that some use:  Measurement Value:......Corresponding Guesstimate 1 High, 2 Low values....Use highest value 2 High, 1 Low value.....Use highest value plus half of second highest 3 similar values........Use 1.5x highest value  MEASURING SUGGESTIONS: --------------------------  Consider/test: - Keeping unit over 1ft away from any conductive material like metals. - Putting unit on a non-conductive holder like dry wood or cardboard. - Reading meter from 5 feet away. - If measuring over a bed, measuring 2" above mattress to take pillow into account and lessen the measurement effect of the springs (if there are any, of course).  SOME OTHER METERS: ----------------------  If looking for a high-end, accurate low frequency EMF meter, consider starting your research with these:  (1) ENERTECH EMDEX II   Measures AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields in the 40Hz-800Hz range, 3-axis, 1-2% of value accuracy.  Sold to power companies and universities in 50+ countries, this is a leading industry tool.  It also has recording, event marking, and software capabilities consistent with the needs of consultants.  It is also excellent at filtering out EMF outside 40Hz-800Hz and is unusually accurate in reading AC Electric Field. ($2,950 for base unit)  (2) GIGAHERTZ SOLUTIONS meters   Made in Germany, sold in North America through Safe Living Technologies, Gigahertz Solutions has a wide variety of accurate affordable models that cover many frequency ranges priced from under two hundred to over a thousand dollars.  Here are some of them, all these listed have HIGH ACCURACY and measure both AC MAGNETIC and AC ELECTRIC fields: 3030B 16Hz-2KHz ($175) This model is a value sweet spot for non-professionals, offering most of everything one is looking for in accurately low frequency magnetic and electric fields. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ME3030B-Electromagnetic-Field-Meter/dp/B003A5R59G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ME3030B Electromagnetic Field Meter</a> 3830B 16Hz-100KHz ($270) This model extends the frequency range to include a range sometimes controversially referred to as dirty electricity.

To measure EMF/RF field strengths AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES you will need a spectrum analyzer.  Some consultants use these for higher-end analyses, however there is usually much more expense and skill involved clearly.  Below is the maker of an affordable hand held spectrum analyzer solution you may wish to read up on..  (3) Aaronia AG Spectran handheld spectrum analyzer I suggest reviewing their website for model options if considering these, there is a variety of models and bundles covering different frequency ranges, covering both AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields.

Of course, for most folks this is way out of budget and often skill set.  I hope this helps some folks serious about EMF/RF measuring get started.	-1
not the best dose not work as good as i expected left with a blank look in my face need to work much better	-1
We bought this for our fun ghost hunting and just to see what the meter would read around the multiple computers and wireless devices in our home. Really fun and seems accurate for the price. Would recommend to others.	1
I searched for a "geiger counter" and this showed-up (along with other unrelated stuff.)  I can only assume that "geiger counter" is hidden somewhere so the search finds it but does not show-up in the text.  This may be a deception but just to be sure, this does not detect radioactive material.	-1

Could not find any tools in my arsenal to crimp this clamp. Between visiting the tool store and looking Online revealed that a decent crimper would cost between $27 - $54. I decided to use my bench vise. I got a good crimp to hold the cable for what I needed it for. The problem is my bench vise is not portable.	1
Perfectly sized for the 7x7 type cable that I usually use, compresses well, and creates a strong bond on the wire rope that doesn't slip.	1

DUMB! The wheels are all drilled so you can only put certain wheels on certain ends of the gearbox. So the wheels with the locks can only go in a certain direction on a certain side of the gearbox. And if you want to put it anywhere else you are going to be in trouble. Personally I ended up yelling at Whirlpool and Gladiator for a while. Then on one end used a single bolt & some epoxy to insure they would stay put. Either way, I'm furious that Gladiator forces your hand in how you align the wheels. Why would I want fixed wheels closest to the front doors of the cart? I want them on a skinny end so I can slide the cart out of the way when not in use. okay rant done. stupid.	-1
These are awesome. Installed in about 5 minutes per set. I ordered two sets when the price was $35 each, wish I ordered a few more. $48 is too steep for some wheels. 1/4" bolts that come with are perfect size. When installing, it is important to remember the "B" engraving on the wheel goes to the inside. Otherwise bolt holes will not align properly. Great Product	1
Installed easy and converted a low cost gladiator cabinet to a more functional like the higher priced units already fitted with casters.	1
I have a refrigerator that broke in such a way that the compressor never cycled off.  It froze everything I put in it.  I bought this temp controller and wired it with a plug and an outlet and now my fridge works better than ever.  This thing saved me some bucks from not having to buy a new fridge.	1
Great	1
Works fine after I wired it up (although I guess I missed the part where I needed to wire it up first!)	1
Pretty good temperature controller	1
So far, so great! Working just as expected. It was a bit annoying to have to splice wires, I am not sure why that is necessary, but it worked out fine.	1
This works very well for controlling my home-made kegerator. It has been in service for ~18 months without any problems. If you can use a screw driver & wire cutters, accomplish easy wiring tasks, and follow YouTube instructions, it is a very easy project to accomplish. It took me ~30-45 minutes once I had all the tools and necessary parts.  I highly recommend a cheap, on/off outlet strip so that you do not have to cut into the power cord of your fridge/freezer.	1
I have this wired up and plugged into a heat mat for seed starting. It is easy to program, works for heating or cooling, is accurate and holds the temperature to a +/- 1*.  And as always, being a Prime Member it was delivered with 2 day free shipping!.	1
I bought this controller to control exhaust fan and it is working great, VERY easy to program too! I recommend to anybody who is in need of a temperature controller.	1
This thing is always accurate which means one less thing to worry about in my salami cabinet or cheese cave.  The wiring diagrams are simple but it can be a bit tricky to manipulate the wires if you have stiff extension chord that you are using to wire it.  Probably doesn't help that I tied a knot in the ends of the extension chords inside the box for strain relief.	1
FOR OPERATING A REFRIGERATOR (or freezer ) ONLY.. STEP BY STEP (complete directions)..  UPDATE:  081511:  MOUNTED ON THE FRIG: Added pictures of how I mounted it to the FRIG..  I did this as an after thought, and have a ton of regrets on the "mounting" design pictured (so I can tell you a whole bunch of ways to improve on this)..  The mount is simple PVC plastic plumbing pipes (used one step spray paint made for plastic and metal, $4)..  First, don't do the complicated "F" shape (shape of the assembled pipes) with all the "T" fittings and elbows I used (because you cant thread the thermostat thru the fittings, and they are unnecessary anyway)..  If you look at the picture, note that I used T fittings to make it stand off the FRIG an inch or so..  This added a lot of complication for no reason whatsoever..  FOR YOURs simple make a F, or C shape with 1" PVC pipes, and the part that touches the frig will be nothing but a pipe (no fittings on it)..  Drill hole thru pipes for mounting (drill pilot hole thru frig sheet metal, then use sheet metal screws..  IMPORTANT NOTE: There is always the possability you could damage your FRIG drilling thru it..  You would be taking that chance..  I drilled away from the electrical stuff on the frig (and drilled thru insulation as I expected)..  TIPS: USE 1" PVC:  I used 3/4, and its way too wiggly..  1" should work better.. PVC is strong, and 1" should be large enough to thread the thermostat thru..  You will need reducer to 1/2" at the end to mount the box with 1/2 nipple)..  Dont mix the thermostat line with electrical wires (you can do it, but dont)..  INSTEAD of saving $2 on the 3 hole box (down on the shopping list), get the box with more holes..  Try to use T fittings where the thermostat will get threaded thru (may not fit thru an elbow)..  F SHAPE: Use (F upside down) if you have a short FRIG, and you want to mount the etc higher (mine is an F)..  You can add a T fitting hear the top to have a place to run the thermostat wire (or drill a hole thru the pipe)..  C SHAPE: On a  tall FRIG, get two 1/2 plastic male thread fittings, and glue them to male two identical L shapes (of PVV pipes)..  Assemble them to the box and you have a C shape (ready to mount to FRIG)..  THERMOSTAT: Run it thru the PVC pipes..  It doesnt have to be concealed completely like a commercial application..  In the pic you can see mine hanging over the top then entering the pipes.. I used rubber hose (drilled out so the thermostat would fit)..  Drilling out a rubber hose turned out to be a lot of work.. I am not sure what to tell you here for drilling a hole thru the FRIG to mount the thermostat inside FRIG..  But if you do not have some way to protect the thermostat wire from the sharp metal in the hole we will drill, it will probably eventually fail and short circuit)..  Using a rubber hose was a pain..  You might try finding a plastic hose (so the inside would be bigger).. But the outside of the hose will be the size of the hole you need to drill..  Then simply slide the protective hose thru the hole (thermostat wire goes thru the hose)..  My  rubber hose is holding itself in place  by luck..  You may need some kind of caulk or something to hold the protective hose in place (maybe a dash inside the hose too to help keep the cold air inside)..  I would use silicone (not sure what is food safe.. probably none of the caulks are for food contact..  ~~~~~~~~~~~~ end UPD  UPDATE:  080711:  Plugged mine in and it works perfectly..  I remember getting hung up on the long wire to drape over both sides of the FRIG..  Silly me, LOL I have a freezer chest..  At least the long wires on both sides will give me the wire I need to put it somewhere convenient (so I still firmly believe longer wires are better than getting stuck too short)..  I wish now I would have paid $2 more for a box with more holes, then I could have easily attached the box to the rear of the freezer and place it at eye level with 3 pieces of water pipe..  Hell, maybe I could use the same mounting pipe to conceal the thermostat probe (drill a hole into the freezer box that enters exactly where the pipe attaches)..  end: RANCO ETC UPDATE:  080711: end: RANCO ETC UPDATE:  080711:  I strongly suggest printing this out if you want to follow this procedure..  I tried to lay it out linear (do it from start to finish)..  Take the printout with you for the shopping list..  I was unable to add pictures directly to this review, but I was able to add pictures to the main page for the ranco ETC.. I will note in the text below when to look at a picture..  I bought a "freezer" chest because when you open it the cold air stays in (condensation is reduced, and energy efficiency increased)..  The disadvantage is if you are doing wine or beer and its too heavy for you to lift out..  Also, I got a freezer specifically, so I can use it as either a FRIG "or" freezer later using the ETC control if I choose..  I am elated there exists such a device for people like me that want to optimize flavor fermenting sauerkraut and for winemaking / beer brewing..  So, here is detailed help for anyone intimidated about wiring their own.. I will monitor for questions or corrections that may need to be made (but amazon takes a day or two to post corrections)..  Unfortunately this has become "very" verbose in an attempt to me more clear .. My goal was to give the ability to wire the ETC, to the complete electrical novice..  But people who already know how to wire should skim thru for the tips to wire it perfectly (the only thing I left off was a fuse; which if you want commercial quality, simply add a 15A fuse into the ckt)..  These notes are on details that are not in the directions that came with the rancho etc, but someone who knows how to do wiring could figure it out..  I am an avid tinkerer of things, so I think I can take the mystery out of how to wire it, and set it up for actual commercial use instead of hoping it works..  There is a shopping list below, of things you already need to buy; so adding $10-20 to the total cost is money well spent to do a fantastic job over a mediocre job (so plan on buying $40 worth of electrical parts, instead of $20-25?)..  When wired optimally, the heavier gauge wires will dissipate heat better which protects the sensitive electronics, and allows you to later hook the rancho etc up to a very large FRIG if you decide to, because you used higher capacity wiring..  And paying $18 instead of $12 for the extension cord sets you up so you don't need to use yet another extension cord later if the plug in is too far away, and gives you the slack you need to plug the FRIG in without pulling the ETC off the FRIG..  I HOPE I DONT GET  A LEMON: As some reviewers complained..  Perhaps they installed this wiring incorrectly (there are ways to screw it up)..  Perhaps the probe was damaged (it is replaceable I believe)..  Common sense says the probe should be near what you want to control,and not in a corner so it will be open to circulating air..  I do not know if we would be better off putting the probe right on the crock... Because I feel TEMP probes tend to be delicate..  Also, see the BULLETIN below about TEMP swings, and compressor protection (this could be another area where people may be having problems)..  Yet another thing that can go wrong is if pieces of copper wire get into the box when wiring it up (you need to "know" where the little pieces went when clipping the wires)..  COMPRESSOR PROTECTION ? ETC NOT WORKING PROPERLY ?  READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO maximize the lifespan of your FRIG (or if the FRIG is not holding the TEMP range the ETC setting is calling for)..  Some troubles may "not" be the fault of the ETC, rather the limited capability of the FRIG itself..  The ETC has no ability to control the compressor cycle time (protect the compressor from damage by turning on too soon after it just ran)..  My first thought was that the FRIG controls would already have this protection function built into its own controls if needed..  But perhaps this is the reason for some of the negative reviews (and no one realized what is happening)..  Few people are complaining, and I saw no complaints of a broken FRIG (although this sort of thing may shorten the life of the FRIG (or it may not; I am choosing to risk it myself)..  I imagine (I don't really know), depending on the design of the refrigerator, the FRIG temp range swing might be part of that protection design (in this particular case, we would have a problem), because the ETC indeed does "force" onto the FRIG a new TEMP RANGE..  The ETC can be set to control within 1-DEGREE, which I doubt any FRIG will do on its own..  The ETC is an electrical relay that functions like kid plugging, then unplugging the FRIG frequently to keep the TEMP range setting..  If you are curious, or have a problem with the TEMP control, I suggest you put the ETC temp probe in the FRIG, but do not control the FRIG with the ETC..  Then simply watch the TEMP range (I "think" you can check the temp this way) to see how the FRIG was designed to operate (if not broken, which the ETC could not cure anyway)..  Then add the ETC back to control the FRIG TEMP..  And tweak back the ETC setting a degree or two tighter (IE: control the TEMP range swing not to 1 or 2 degrees, but closer to the temp swings that the FRIG wants to do on its own), and then you will see if the problem goes away (if it does go away, you can tighten up the ETC temp range one more degree at a time and you will eventually know how far you can push your FRIG).. WHY 1 DEGREE TEMP RANGE ANYWAY: For SAUER KRAUT I plan to use 3 degrees range to keep the TEMP exactly in the TEMP range given by Harsch (minus 1 degree colder to account for the possible spontaneous heating of the crock caused by fermentation).. I feel there is no reason to keep the temp so tightly controlled, because TEMP swings are common in nature..  But, I am interested if anyone has any theories that the end result might taste better..  MY KRAUT: 2-3 days at 20-22C (68-72), then 15-18C (59-64 F.) for 4-6 weeks..  Wiring the ETC according to these directions sets everything up to put the ETC control on tof of the frig (but alternately you can put it somewhere else because there will be a longish cord on either end..  TOOLS: TOOLS: TOOLS:  Screwdriver, electrical pliers, regular pliers too, knife or razor (and you can get by with a knife if you do not have electrical pliers, but you will still need wire cutters.. an old fingernail cutter will probably work to get a clean snip)..  You will need a smaller than normal screwdriver, because a full size one will not fit the ETC..  SHOPPING LIST: SHOPPING LIST: SHOPPING LIST:  25 FOOT 14 GAGUE EXTENSION CORD: You are spending $6 more for this longer heavier cord..  A little too long is always better than too short..  I strongly suggest you buy an extension cord as close to this one as you can (because the compression connectors and finicky.. the round diameter of the cord is what is needed to make it work)..  I bought a HUSKY, round medium duty indoor/outdoor 14 gauge extension cord..  14 GAUGE is the same wire gauge a 15a house wiring uses, so it should easily handle any FRIG as a load (rather than overloading which leads to premature failure of electrical devices, or possibly fire)..  DBL GANG (SQUARE) OUTDOOR ELECTRICAL BOX: (and cover): Costs $9-10..  Get 1/2 inch size (refers to holes in box)..  Also get a plain square metal cover..  Get 3 hole (cheaper)..  NOTE: if you are planning to install to frig, get the box with more holes..  ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS: 3 RED twist ties, and 2 YELLOW twist tie connectors..  The ones with the little wings are easier to use..  COMPRESSION FITTINGS: Buy two of these (one for each cut end of the extension cord..  See the notes for the extension cord to buy (above)..  I suggest you ask the store clerk for help with the connectors (because the compression fittings can be confusing, and there are so many to choose from, so it will save time to locate them)..  The size .260-.375 worked perfectly on mine..  The compression connector looks more finished, and more importantly protects the extension cord from damage..  The type of compression fitting will be the one with a larger rubber chunk, rather than a little plastic or rubber ring only..  FITTING TO CONNECT THE ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX: You are going to have to piece things together here.. ~1~  Buy a 1/2 pipe nipple (that screws into the center hole on the DBL GANG BOX).. ~2~  Buy a bag of 3 or more 1/2 - 3/4 reducing washers (in the electrical stuff).. ~3~  Buy a standard lock washer..  JUMPERS: BUY 14 GAUGE SOLID COPPER.. YOU NEED: 1-green (or bare), 2 blacks 1-red and 1-white (a foot or a little less long.. I used about 8 inches)..  These wires are to extend from the DBL GANG BOX to the ETC BOX (JUMPERS)..  At home depot you can buy this wire by the foot..  First choice is to buy individual solid copper wires in all the colors you need..  Else buy a multi cable with several colors inside so all you need to do is cut it up (avoid buying stranded wires, unless you have a soldering iron needed to tin the ends.. because stranded and stranded don't do well together in the wire nut connectors)..  IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SAVE $5-10 or so: Don't, LOL..  If you get extension and jumper wires both 14 gage, it will strong enough to handle "all" the current a 15A plugin can put out..  But, 20A fuses are sometimes found in kitchens too (and you would need 12 gage wire to handle a 20A ckt)..  But, the ETC in this application is only going to operate a FRIG..  So 16 gauge probably OK if you really really want to save a few dollars, because 16 gauge should be able to handle 13-14 AMPS, which I feel sure would be ok for a normal FRIG..  But as mentioned before 14 gauge will give you handle a large FRIG Should you choose inthe future, and dissipate heat better (which may be cheaper if this saves your ETC, or FRIG from a break down)..  Also, if you choose 16 gauge the compression fittings are finicky, and probably will not work, and these are a nice touch to doing a good job..  FUSE: I did not add a fuse to mine..  You can add one if you want an additional layer of perfection and safety..  Typically commercial use things will have these fuses rather than home use things (I mean you would basically be putting a fuse on an extension cord, and who does that)..  Home depot did not have this part, or I might have picked one up..  They said to try fries, but maybe radio shack would have some kind of fuse..  I wanted something on the outside of the box like a fuse button, rather than a fusible link that would end up hidden in the DBL GANG BOX..  Wire the fuse in series with the black power wire coming from the plug-in side (series means cut the black wire only and add the fuse)..  FEET (and screws): FEET (and screws): The box will scratch the FRIG without these feet..  You will need 4-feet.. Get the rubber ones in the picture (you should be able to identify them at the store)..  Here is the story here..  I forced the sheet metal screws that came with the feet, and they barely worked..  The rubber starts to curl up (with screw about to pop thru the rubber which means the rubber falls off, just as the screw goes in deep enough to do its job)..  Since I already stripped the holes in mine, I will have to buy longer sheet metal screws, and then add the washers.. DO THIS INSTEAD: DO NOT use the screws that come with the rubber feet..  Instead buy 4 screws (round head machine screw that fits in the DBL GANG BOX HOLE without stripping the threads)..  I do not know the exact screw size because I did not use these (just carry the box over to the hardware section and get the right screw)..  The length needs to be 3/4" or longer (can be deep as the box allows)..  Also buy 4 washers (same size as the screw.. size #6 or #8.. I cant remember)..  POP the washers into the rubber so the screw doesnt pull thru (if the washers you find are too small, you can probably find other styles of washers that will work)..  Or, it may be easier to get sheet metal screws (and strip the threads out when you force them in), because these can be found with heads large enough to fit the rubber feet.. NOTE: After all this screwing around with the feet, I ended up permanently mounting mine on the frig (so the feet are hanging in the air, LOL)..  USEFUL INFO: USEFUL INFO: USEFUL INFO:  BLACK: hot (smaller slot on plug in). WHITE: neutral (larger slot in plug-in).. GROUND (bare or green):  CONNECTOR BLOCKS INSIDE THE ETC: THE UPPER RIGHT TERMINAL BLOCK:  Gets power from the house plug (white and black 120v where white is the common)..  THE LOWER LEFT TERMINAL BLOCK:  Is a simple relay that actuates according to the temp control setting of the ETC (the common terminal here is a hot=black wire jumper)..  When the relay actuates, the hot then gets connected to the NO (normally open) terminal which turns on the FRIG compressor (for this wiring setup)..  We connect the RED wire to the FRIG to the NO (middle) terminal..  ADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS: ADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS: ADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS:  USE THIS TECHNIQUE FOR ALL ELEC CONN:  Tighten by hand, then crank it with regular pliers until it is satisfyingly snug..  Generally the rule of thumb if to tighten it tight enough so that it is difficult if not impossible to remove by hand..  CUT THE EXTENSION CORD: Cut 10 foot from the end where the FRIG will plug in (so it will drape from the top of the FRIG to the floor (the other end of the extension cord drapes off the other side so it helps hold the ETC in place rather than dragging it off onto the floor)..  The remainder is 15 feet for the plug in end to hunt for an outlet (which really is not too long after it travels 5-8 feet down the side of the FRIG)..  STRIP THE SHEATH: This is probably the trickiest part, because this is where you can screw up and "easily" cut to bare wire ("really" take your time here.. lightly score then pull and twist by hand to deepen the scores.. score a little more repeat)..  You have to remove about 6" of the sheath from each end of the extension cord you cut (to break out the individual wires)..  How to  do this is to bend the whole cord sharply, then very carefully score with a razor blade/knife at the bend where there is stress on the casing (DO NOT CUT TOO DEEP (not even all the way thru the sheath covering) a simple score (think glass or diamond cutting) will make it so you can pull, and the casing should come off in your hand)..  You can carefully grip near the score mark with pliers, and sometime the sheath comes off easier this way..  CUT UP THE JUMPERS: Locate the 14-gauge wires you bought, and simply cut up 2-BLACK, 1-WHITE, 1-RED, 1-GREEN or bare (you can strip all the insulation off one of the other colors to get a bare wire) ~~~ 10" - 12" long each (I cut mine a little short, and sure enough it made considerable more work for me)..  Strip the casing off only one end now (strip the 1/3 inch end only) to expose the copper wire (elec pliers make this part very easy; else this will be a little tedious with a razor blade.. if you don't have elec pliers, cut rather gently so you don't gouge the wire too bad (if you score and pull it somewhat works like removing the sheath above)..  One end should be 5/8 - 3/4 inch (strip these later as you wire), the other end should be about 1/3 inch..  TIGHTEN EXTENSION CORD INTO COMPRESSION FITTINGS: Open up the compression fitting (the parts get in the way so remove them now)..  Note the direction of the rubber piece (the cone shaped part of the rubber needs to meet the same cone shape metal)..  Screw the compression fittings into the already threaded holes 180 degrees apart on the DBL GANG BOX.  Warning, I scratched my box with the pliers (easy to do because the grip is so small)..  Crank with pliers until you can not budge them by hand..  Slide the pieces over the extension cord, and then insert the extension cord so the sheath extends into the DBL GANG BOX (MAKE SURE YOU PULL IN 8 INCHES LONG TOTAL INSIDE THE BOX, or it makes more work for you)..  Tighten with pliers and monitor so you know when the compression starts grabbing the wire..  Then keep tightening until you cannot pull it out by hand (you may need to tighten these quite a bit)..  IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH COMPRESSION FITTING: These can be a PITA (good luck, they can be finicky), so first make sure you have the right size compression fitting (there are at least two sizes)..  If this fails too, I would try to insert a wire bet in a sharp V shape to take up more space inside the rubber compression part (but MAKE SURE THE COPPER IS OUTSIDE THE BOX.. in other words only the non conductive wire casing can be "inside" the elec box)..  Worst case scenario is to replace these with simple romex connectors (that look bad, and can break the casing of the extension cord; if you use this option, monitor to know when the ext cord snugs up in the fitting, and tweak it only a little more tight)..  THIS 180 DEGREE DESIGN WAS CHOSEN: To allow us to drape the extension cord over the FRIG 180 degree apart, so the wires hanging over both sides of the FRIG will help hold the ETC in place rather than dragging it off onto the floor..  ATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX: ATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX: ATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:  We need a little special care here for two reasons..  In the case of the plastic ETC box, if you get it too tight, it will weaken the plastic over time, and BAM, it may break apart later as the stress deteriorates the integrity of the plastic..  So tighten until its only a little snug and not wobbly (if a kid tried hard, they would be able to unscrew it by hand)..  When I tightened mine to the directions below, I noticed I was able to turn (adjust) the etc box, without the lock washer unscrewing itself, which is what you hope for)..  I think the washers made this lucky thing happen..  Second reason is we need a spacer BT the box's so that the casing of the ETC can be screwed back on without binding when done (and the etc can be adjusted to turn right or left without scraping the other box)..  Screw the 1/2" nipple into the center threaded hole on the back of the DBL GANG BOX..  I found a paper towel folded a lot, was enough to protect the threads from the pliers (if you don't protect the threads, it may be much more difficult to to do the final tightening later)..  Screw it in kind of tight (better to protrude more into the DBL GANG BOX)..  HOW TO STACK THE WASHERS BETWEEN THE BOXES..  This is a little tricky, so find the picture I added to the main page of the ETC..  The caption in the PIC says the following: Copy this one exactly, so the lock washer will allow you to pivot the ETC without loosening the lock washer..  NOTE the 2 washers between the two boxes (the larger side of each washer is touching the other)..  Then the larger part of the washer inside the ETC box is touching the plastic.  The LOCK WASHER teeth point into the washer..  The reducing washers go against the plastic to protect the plastic from the lock washer teeth..  I am not sure which is best way to face these washers, but the exact way it was done in the picture works great.. The two washers between the BOXES separate them slightly (so the screws will not bind when attaching the ETC cover later)..  IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO TIGHTEN THE LOCK WASHER..  I felt lucky I was able to get my pliers on it..  If you cant tighten it with pliers, you can get a hammer and screwdriver (or punch) and tap on the lock washer to tighten it..  I was able to turn my ETC to adjust which way I wanted it to face..  I did tighten it enough so it was kind of hard to turn..  It would be possible for a kid to keep twisting it in the same direction until it breaks the wires inside (kids can break anything though)..  With the larger DBL GANG BOX, and the combination of stranded wires used, you should be able to twist this thing back and fourth 180-360 degrees all you want with no damage to the wires (as the stranded are flexible)..  The only concern is that the metal lock washer might someday lose its lock and then the whole box would start to become lose and wobbly (no deal breaker, just open it up and tighten it.. or not)..  WIRING THE ETC : informational: WIRING THE ETC : informational: WIRING THE ETC : informational:  Dont do this part yet (informational).  You need a small screwdriver to tighten the ETC screws..  We used a separate box (to make a base for the ETC to stand on) and because it will be much easier to slide wires to adjust the needed length into the ETC box (and have a much better feel when the wire is actually in the connector)..  Notice the length of the bare copper into the ETC BOX terminals..  Snip the copper all the same length so no more than 1/4" of bare copper is visible, yet the copper is visible so you know the metal is clamping down on the wire..  Tighten these down (same technique; when wire is snug, tighten a little more than test that you cannot pull out the wires easily)..  This procedure helps you not break the etc terminal, which would kill your day until you could get a new ETC unit..  TERMINAL SCREW NOTE: The screws that tighten the wires in the ETC terminals are tricky..  You still turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten, but expect the metal clamp to move "up" to clamp onto the wire..  What is tricky is that when you turn the screw counter clock wise to open up the hole, it appears above where you think it should be..  IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! Be careful when snipping wires (thorough this entire procedure) so that pieces of conductive copper do not end inside the electrical box's (this happens all the time, and this is very bad for obvious reasons)..  Little pieces of copper can short the main power.. And even the smallest little shard of a strand can easily burn out the $60 ETC electronics..  HOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES: HOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES: HOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES:  Wait until you are installing the twist connector to strip the ends off the wires (because you typically snip the wires to the length you want at this point anyway)..  If any of the wires go to the ETC box then install the JUMPERS into the ETC terminal first (then gather the wires to install the twist connector)..  Strip the ends 1/3 inch, then stick the wire thru the hole into the ETC terminal and tighten down the screw..  Find all the wires that will be wire tied together and cut to the same length (whatever length you feel is convenient to add the wire tie)..  Strip the wires and install the twist connector..  ALL SOLID COPPER JUMPERS TRAVEL FROM THE DBL GANG BOX INTO THE ETC BOX.. USE YELLOW TWIST CONNECTORS: for 2 wires.. USE ~ RED ~ TWIST CONNECTORS: for 3 wires..  EVERY TIME YOU CONNECT A WIRE, into a connector or terminal, "monitor" when the wires snug up by pulling lightly on the wire (or "ALL" the wires if a twist connector)..  When you find the wire (wires) are starting too hold together, then twist a few more times, then verify that the wires cannot be pulled out by hand..  This may sound tedious, but its easy, and if you dont, there will probably be a bad connection that will haunt you and make the equipment act flakey down the road..  I hate to suggest this, because tightening these twist connectors with your fingers is should be adequate..  But I cheat and "gently" hold all the wires with the pliers to get the last turn..  IF YOU DO THIS, MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DAMAGE THE WIRE CASINGS (I guess you could add electrical tape if you need to)..  HOW TO STRIP THE ENDS OF THE EXTENSION CORD WIRES: The solid wires are easy to strip (so here is how to do the stranded ones)..  Strip to 3/4 inch (or a pinch longer because stranded wires pull up slightly when you tighten them)..  The elec pliers most people have are for solid copper, not stranded, so use one gauge larger to strip the ends (or you "will" shave off the copper strands of the wires)..  The plastic is usually soft on these, so you can swirl the wire in a circular shape (in the larger gauge hole of the pliers) to strip the ends..  If you only have a knife be extra careful stripping the ends because the thin strands are very easy to cut when you score..  Fortunately, the casing on these is usually easier to remove (so lightly score and pull with fingers usually works)..  INSTALL CONNECTOR on :::::: SOLID: Hold solid copper together with the ends even and twist the connector on..  INSTALL CONNECTOR on :::::: SOLID TO STRANDED: These are a little trickier..  Twist each individual stranded wire tip to make it act more like a solid wire..  When you hold the ends together to attach the twist connector, the ends of the stranded should be slightly longer than the copper, slightly overlapping (longer than the solid) but we are only talking 1/16 inch (or less)..  Solid to stranded is trickier, so if it fails (you find you can pull it out with your fingers), try again (until you can not pull the wires out by hand)..  There is extra length in the wires, so it it fails twice, then cut off the frayed ends (1 inch), and try again..  BEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS: BEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS: BEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS:  -1-  CONNECT GROUND WIRE IN DBL GANG BOX: Locate the green screw that came with the box (you can find the screw hole location in the pictures for this item)..  This screw will cut its own threads when you screw it into the hole (which makes a sure electrical connection)..  Wrap the copper wire around the screw in a semi circle around the screw (bend circle in the direction so that tightening the screw will tend to close the circle rather than open it)..  Tighten down the screw..  Install twist connector..  GROUND IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE: we have wires in a metal box, and so it must be grounded for electrical safety..  Likewise, this ground wire will transfer thru the extension cord to also ground the metal cabinet of the FRIG (to prevent the metal FRIG casing from becoming 120 VOLTS if an electrical fault develops someday)..  -2-  CONNECT WHITE WIRES..  White jumper to UPPER RIGHT TERMINAL BLOCK (C terminal on the right)..  -3-  CONNECT THE BLACK WIRE FROM THE SIDE THAT PLUGS INTO THE WALL:  This one has 2-BLACK jumper wires into the ETC box (to provide 120 V power to two places).. Black jumper to UPPER RIGHT TERMINAL BLOCK (120, middle terminal). Black jumper to LOWER LEFT TERMINAL BLOCK (C terminal on the right)..  -4-  CONNECT THGE BLACK WIRE THAT WILL GO TO THE FRIG (RED JUMPER)..  Red jumper goes to LOWER LEFT TERMINAL BLOCK Normally Open (NO) terminal in the middle..  ADD RUBBER FEET TO THE BOX: See the SHOPPING LIST SECTION for details..  Locate the screws and washers you bought and attach the feet thru the same holes that hold the BOX cover in place..  I did not do this part, so you may have to improvise.. There are several options..  If the screws I asked for in the SHOP LIST don't work well (and the feet still are not very secure)..  You can simply go back and buy the exact same size screw that came with the feet (sheet metal screw), but at least 1/2 inch longer..  This will probably work without washers, because with a longer screw you will not need to over tighten (which then pops the rubber feet off the screws) to secure the cover, and the head will be larger too..  But try to use washers anyway here..

There are usually layers of safety built into the system, but believe me one or more layers are frequently already compromised due to shoddy workmanship and defective materials (and you never know what might happen if you spill some frig liquid, or a kid pulls on the wires..  Make sure the wiring was done correctly here so this safety layer remains intact..  OPTIONS: There are several ways to test this..  You can use an OHM METER, VOLT METER, or if you have no way to test, then either st	1
They work great! Could be a little cheaper. You can buy these at REI for the same price.	1
Good product.	1
A sensor designed for an alarm system. It does not have an alarm and cannot work independantly. I bought it thinking it was a heat alarm and found it works only with an alarm system. Contacted the company, but they do not pay for return shipping. I guess I will donate it to someone as the return shipping cost is about the cost of the item.	-1
The accuracy of these is fine.  However there are scores of other calipers that are also accurate.  The digital display is too small and has poor contrast - reminds me of the first Casio digital watch I owned in the 1970's.  Times have changed and an 8 mm digit size doesn't cut it anymore.  The mushy buttons are nothing special - buttons with a positive tactile click are preferred these days.  The resistance to sliding is quite high - not as easy as the newer competing units.  Not a big deal maybe, but it imparts a low quality impression.  In summary, its like this product has not been updated in the past 40 years.  There's no reason to buy these except possibly for museum curators who need to complete their "measuring instruments of the 1970's"  collection.	-1
AS ADVERTISED, FAST SHIPPING!!	1
For the price its great	1
As advertised.	1
Better than the Frankford Arsenal piece of junk I bought initially (that went back to Amazon) I would change two things: It should have an on / off button, it does have an on button but you have to rely on the auto-off feature to turn it off and at least mention that the rubber piece in the battery compartment needs to be removed prior to installing the battery, you can still install the battery with it in there, just doesn't work.	1
measures a .404 plus pin at .404, and within .0005 of my Starrett dial caliper according to 5 random sized gauge pins between 1/4 to 1 inch.  You probably get 3/4 the workmanship of a Starrett or Mitsu for 1/4 the price.  And for what it's worth, this unit gives me those numbers everywhere from 35 degrees dry as hell to 90 degree and high humidity	1
As accurate as calipers can be. Great deal.	1
Amazing tool for the price, comes with two batteries & instructions plus plastic case. Quality is very good, however is not waterproof, accuracy is very good. Do not have a off-button, when the Caliper is turn on the only way to turn it off is by waiting to turn off by itself  with a preset time out. So far the first battery had last since I got this tool.	1
The slide felt a little rough at first but became reasonably smooth after just a few minutes of use. The accuracy is good. Obviously if you need extreme precision you would want to use a micrometer instead, but for quick and dirty measurements these work fine. The included plastic case looks nice and the calipers come with two batteries.	1
Nice instrument.  Perfect for around the house projects. I	1
With all the Digital tools and calipers around I began to notice that without Batteries the shop is down!  Now I have most of my tools Dial and adjustable with test bars and weights.	1
It's made in Pakistan, but it is a top quality product. Well worth the Price tag. (word count one two three)	1
Can perfectly zeroed and appears to be well built and accurate. This is exactly the price and quality I was searching for.	1
At this price, this caliper is perfect!  I feel confident trusting this caliper specially when working with microwaves guides.	1
Good little dishes overall  Pro: Good size Good quality (durable)  Con: At least one broken in shipping in every order. (so order extra if you need that exact ammount)	1
As expected	1
Just what I needed!  Thanks!	1
I used them to make jello shots with Vodka for a mad scientist party, (put sprinkles on top to look like rod shaped bacteria). My graduate degree is in biochem, so I guess that explains it.	1
Just one of the 20 dishes was broken when I got it.  Note that these dishes will not shut tightly with their lids on so they only be useful during gameplay. For storage you might want to use a rubberband	1
Quick Shipping and great product	1

Perfect for my CSI lesson. Pretty sturdy.	1
These have been great. Can verify they are sterile and worked like they should. What else can you say? They're petri dishes and at a good price.	1
In spite of a review from Nov. 2012, the size has not been corrected. Mine measured 86mm x 11mm. I think we should be able to expect a truthful description from a seller, especially since it has been pointed out before. My uses were non-scientific so the size difference didn't make much difference for my uses, but if they are said to be 100 x 15mm, then that is what I expect.	-1
For a great price, a large bundle of well crafted and uniform petri dishes are available with this product. A bargain for any lab or scientific study.	1
Great price on these petri dishes.  They arrived in time for Christmas and are being used by a 9 yr old for "science" projects.	1
The bags are A-OK and are pretty good quality.  They come in a cardboard box that dispenses them like kleenex.  Might not sound like much but sure beats getting a loose wad of bags and storing them.	1
Great price	1
nice	1
thanks	1
I don't think i actually love it as the 5 star appraisal states, but do think that the product deserves 5 stars. It is exactly what is advertised. Cant ask for better than that.	1
Your standard set.  Came with lubricant.  What else can I say?	1
works great	1
Simple, easy to use and inexpensive.  Works well and doesn't hurt patients.  Fits the otoscope like a glove.  Good Buy.	1
A foot surgeon recommended these. So, I bought a bag full and use them in every shoe.	1
Works well. If it doesnt last a long time ill deduct a star but so far so good. Much cheaper than oem bulb	1
Product was as described.	1
I craft with duct tape more than I actually use it for quick fixes so I go through a lot of it.  The biggest reason I like this brand over others is that it's thinner and more flexible with a good amount of adhesion. The biggest con with this brand is that it doesn't come in enough colors for duct tape crafters.  All the brands I've tried don't handle heat well, which means you shouldn't use duct tape on ducts. Pick another sealant method like mastic or a foil tape.  Pros: Cost! Scotch brand, if you work it out to price per foot is generally less expensive than other brand name duct tapes. Flexibility- because it's a thin tape, it shapes around things very well and folded seams can be smaller and overlap areas are less bulky Strength- I carried a duct tape purse for a year. It handled all the stuff I put in it, and the way I bang around my purses very well. Adhesion- when burnished down, this tape adheres very well, but can still be pulled off of smooth surfaces if you need to. I have it currently taping various usb cords on my computer to keep them organized.  Cons: Colors- seriously 3M? I'll be your biggest crafty cheerleader for your duct tape and make myself duct tape pompoms and maybe even a cheerleader skirt in duct tape if you just come out with more colors. The biggest competition for your brand in duct tape has colors and patterns. You are ignoring a big crafty market.  This is my favorite duct tape and the brand I recommend for duct tape clothing, purses and crafts as well as for quick fixes.	1
very nice thanks	1
was a stuck/melted mess on the roll.  couldn't pull any tape off  Had to return, and went with traditional grey duck tape.  Back to happy.	-1
Solid unit, the few drawbacks of which were noted by prior posters.  It's darn near as good as the better Welch Allens (WA has multiple lines, and some are subpar), and has a much more approachable price.  Would I use this in my office - nope, but for a vacation home or scuba diving trip, yup.	1
A must have if you are moving or do anything that involves carrying a lot of boxes for whatever reason. I have a bad back and it has saved me a lot of embarrassment plus it allows you to carry more than you normally would without the strap. I used it to carry some dj equipment to a wedding from the truck and it saved me quite a few trips as I have a bad back. Very durable, It is everything it is advertised to be and Amazon rocks!	1
For moving or just occassional toting of packages. This strap is awesome. I also have the 8ft strap. see my review.	1
I don't know how I used to live my medical life without these scissors.  Other bandage scissors simply weren't up to par, but these can handle any bandage job. Thank you, Lister bandage scissors - you saved my career.  They're scissors, guys. They work like scissors.	1
The mirror breaks very easily. The manufacturer wants $13.38 to send me the k-2R replacement mirror. There is no sheath or protective guard provided to prevent breakage. I believe this is intentional, to generate extra revenue from replacement mirror sales.  A really borderline business plan.  I would give it 5 stars, otherwise, because it is a good product to use. Just easy to break and expensive to replace the mirror.  Staples is a better place to buy this. They will have a whole new K-2 for you to pick up at their store for $6.99.	-1
OMG Buy it. for $5 best deal ever. This thing is great.	1
Well built. Cheaper than poor quality Chinese parts store junk.	1
It's hard to get excited about an inspection mirror but when you need one - nothing else will do.  I actually bought two -  a small one and a medium sized one.  Both are decent quality and were reasonably priced.	1
Fine telescoping mirror for maintenance work. Reasonably well built and should serve you well, the only down side is that it doesn't extend very far.	1
this is a great mirror made in the USA	1
I used this product along with Sculpwood Epoxy to repair a rotted-out section of a window. After cleaning out the rotten section, I mixed and applied the liquid to the remaining wood . It sinks in and needs to be reapplied until all the tiny voids in the wood are filled. You can immediately apply the SculpWood over it without waiting for it to dry. This is a great product.	1
Too early to tell how well it works.  Big problem was that one of the bottle's lid does not tighten enough to seal.  Had to transfer to another bottle I had handy.	-1
Pricey But pretty simple to mix and use --applied vertically with a paint brush let sit 12 hours due to coo; temps wood appears to be solisd after removing rotten areas	1
The system works great.... I'm Happy.	1
Quick service and good product A+++	1
I purchased this after achieving good results with the EndRot kit. I'm very pleased with the results on my termite-damaged window sill and frame.  Here are two tips that will help you:   1. One of the videos mentions that you can apply the SculpWood while the RotFix is still tacky. Take advantage of this: It speeds the job considerably, and helps you get the SculpWood to stick to the wood deep in all the cracks and crevices.   2. Build up the SculpWood putty above the surface of your repair as shown in the directions. Then wait 12-24 hours and carve the excess away with a sharp chisel. This is MUCH faster and easier than sanding after it dries. The consistency is like a raw potato at this point: easy to carve with a chisel just by pushing it through the excess material to the shape you want.	1
This wood-rot repair kit sets the standard.  However, the kit, as supplied, is superior to the same brand in most hardware stores since it is available in a more realistic quantity.  Dry-rot usually comes in wide-spread patches.	1
The solution worked as advertised.  Very clear instructions and easy to follow.  We were able to repair the lower part of a window that had rotted away.  The only other solution was to replace the window at a cost of $900-$1,000!  Would recommend to anyone with a similar problem.	1
Resins were not sealed and the Part B hardener had about 2" less resin in the container than normal.	-1
Light sucks . . . Just use a regular inspection mirror and a small flashlight, it's hard to get the light and the mirror to line up to see exactly what you want to see.  It's just awkward.  Sorry Ullman, nice try though.	-1
These are awkward ...Light sucks.  Better off with a plain insprction mirror and a small flashlight.  Nice try but FAIL...IMO	-1
Dries in weeks not hours no matter how brown you mix it!	-1
Part B Resin Hardener separated -- has dark streaks through it.  When mixed with Part A, the combined product is a sticky semi-liquid semi-solid -- does not form into a nice workable solid.	-1
I was only able to to try it on the one device I needed it to work for (digital coax out of the TV to an optical in on a soundbar).  It didn't work, despite the fact that all 3 optical cables I tried (one very basic black plastic one, one more flexible plastic, and one glass) had red light coming out of it, and all three cables work in other applications.  Dunno if I got a dud or not, but it wasn't worth the hassle of returning.	-1
I tried two of these and they both lagged behind the picture.	-1
Was little bend. Packing not proffessional.	-1
Philips is so CHEAP !  This company sells the 2-brush set with only one - count it, one - recharging base.  So your family member with whom you share the bathroom has to remember to remove your brush from the stand and put their brush, each day, or  some such arrangement.  How Stupid, how lazy, how cheap!  Philips writes in the manual that comes with this thing that one should not use the recharging base from an other model with this unit.  I had another, older unit.  Of course the new brush was purposely made not to fit the old recharger -- planned obsolescence.  But I got it to fit by expanding the base.  I heated it with a hot air dryer and pushed the somewhat softened plastic of the bas outward to make room for the slightly larger base of the new brush.  That, plus a bit of scraping.  Teach Philips a lesson and buy another brand!	-1
I bought this toothpaste because of the flavor - and it is very good for toothpaste. I can't recommend this though for several reasons: the box promises to freshen your breath with Scope and to whiten your teeth. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually do either of those things plus you get a lot less than a normal toothpaste.  The "Scope" part of the gel immediately liquefies once in your mouth instantly cutting the gel on your brush in half. The very small amount of "Scope" isn't enough to freshen your breath for more than a few minutes after brushing. Plus, since we lose about half of the gel in the tube, we are effectively buying half the toothpaste, as that of a standard competitor 6 ounce size, for the same cost (or more - this same toothpaste is available at Wal-Mart for about $2).  The "whitening" claim is also misleading as the whitening that you and I think of when we buy toothpaste is an additional chemical that works to lighten the color of our teeth. The "whitening" that Crest is talking about, though, is the same you would get from rubbing any toothpaste on your teeth: the toothpaste in conjunction with your brush helps scrub the stains off the enamel of your teeth. Crest isn't the only company to do this. I recently went down the aisle at a local store and found that most of the toothpastes advertising "whitening" have in small print that they scrub your teeth of surface stains, i.e., they clean your teeth not actually whiten them.	-1
I hate this bag.  It is very difficult to fill you have to hold it open while balancing a container to fill from.  It is awkward to hang. You have to cut out a hole to hang and the material around it is flimsy.  The tubing is very stiff and the shut off device even stiffer.  It takes two hands and a lot of pressure to shut off.  This is nearly impossible if you have arthritis in your hands.  There are much better disposable bags on the market. I will not order these again.	-1
Sealant is fine, but the shipping took forever.	-1

Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.	-1
these terminals are not as heavy duty as those purchase from HomeDepot, although they are rated the same. Really worried about if these can hold up the same amount of electric current. Easily deformed when crimping to wires, easily loosen up after crimping. The metal material is too thin to hold the shape.	-1

Hello fellow Amazonians: We purchased a number of these items based on the seemingly positive reviews it has. Unfortunately, they were constructed with poor quality materials and rather shoddily put together.

Unfortunately we'll be returning these items in search of a better quality product state side. Shame.	-1
Thought these were comparable to those in the auto parts store but after trying them, they are not. The internal metal is not sturdy enough to hold the crimp on the wire. Just a slight tug and the wire becomes loose, another slight tug and it will pull right out. I had a few of these come apart when trying to disconnect them from switches. When you grab the blue part to pull it off the corresponding blade, the blue part and the wire come off but the metal part stays connected. I do not recommend these connectors.	-1
low quality connector suitable for extremely low voltage connections. Any connection that draws amps, DON't use this low quality item	-1

I bought a hundred of the male and female connectors. These things are terrible. The metal is way to thin and will not grip heavy copper like 10 to 12 gauge as it's meant to.

Very poor quality. I have 40 years in the electronics industry. Keep in mind the color. Yellow is for heavy gauge wire such as 12 gauge. The metal that you crimp on to the copper is so thin it will not hold the wire correctly. I used three types of crimps, all worked terrible. Don't buy.	-1

These terminals seem to be well made for the price, however they do not function well.  Once connected, the male and female "quick disconnects" are nearly impossible to pull apart. I had to use a vise and pliers to get them apart.  I ordered these with the intention of having something that I could quickly disconnect, but these do not fit the bill.  If you are only going to make a connection with these and do not plan to ever disconnect them, then I would say buy them. If you need to be able to pull them apart then get something else like a bullet connector.	-1

I used this to glue some insulation to my garage door.  The insulation is thin, smooth and light.  I figured it would stick well, but much of it has come off. It's probably because the sun hits the garage door and warms it up.  But it's not like the garage door gets that hot from the morning sun here in Virginia.	-1
How can people be promoting this glue like this? People are becoming ILL from using this. Plus, it does not work very well! I have used this glue on crystal, metal, plastic and glass. It can easily be pulled apart by a child. --Even though, it should NEVER BE USED IN A HOME WITH CHILDREN! .. Please, please, use something else!!! Otherwise, use a respirator. There are other reviewers who say they use a respirator (not just a simple fume mask. A respirator.) ..But why use something that requires a respirator?! .. Please use something else.  Good luck, friends. I hope that you can find an alternative. Two-part epoxies are waaaay better, by the way! "Devcon 2-Ton" is clear and is is waaaay stronger, with just about no small at all.	-1

This is not the best epoxy for reef tanks. The glue is very runny and comes off the frag plug while in the water. A few of my fish tried to eat it since it was floating in the water. That was very bad for the fish. Also this epoxy is not very strong, the red leg hermits pop the frags of the rock since the epoxy is not very strong.	-1
A week after I bought this tank, the Hoover quit working. Threw it all in the garbage.	-1

I really only wanted the small basket, but since they're only sold as a set I thought maybe I could use the other 2 for something else. When I opened the box to view its contents I was simultaneously amazed and disappointed, amazed at how they work and disappointed at how poorly constructed they are. It's one thing to use thin plastic, but these are so thin that I'm doubtful of their durability. By comparison I have a file hanging plastic box from Rubbermaid that holds about 1000 sheets of paper and I can carry it around without worrying about the paper falling out the bottom. Additionally, although the plastic of these baskets is PP they emit a strange smell that hasn't gone away completely after 2 days of fresh air in my home.  The large basket by virtue of its immense size is not sturdy enough to hold heavy items. The bottom bows out, as does the medium basket, though not as bad. The small basket is the sturdiest of them all, but the poor construction of all the baskets severely limits their usefulness. What I'm most disappointed about is how the individual pieces are connected. The handles have tabs that look like a glob of hardened plastic; they're not uniform in shape, but the holes in the frame itself aren't even round; they look like they were haphazardly burned in with a soldering iron or something that they're too big & the handles thus loose. The same goes for the folding sides, which I noticed because one of the sides just fell out. Upon closer inspection of the tab and the hole I discovered that the holes are malformed. If that's not bad enough, the plastic in several areas look like they were cut by wire cutters so they're not smooth. The edge of some of the side hinges are damaged that they don't properly hook onto the other side at the corners.  Plastic clippings trash and plastic chemical fumes can't be good for the health and environment of the Chinese workers who have to endure this hazardous work so that Americans can enjoy convenience. I'll just use them till they break and try to find a proper way to recycle them. I recommend that you don't buy these at all.	-1
These are NOT luer lock syringes as shown in the product picture. They have slip on connections. They should be fine if you want a slip on connection, but I need (and expected) a luer lock connection.	-1
this product works well, but turns out to be about three times the price of others.	-1

I have not had good luck with this stethoscope working as I expected it to work.  When I use my doctor's L brand scope, I hear my heart beat louc and clear; however, I cannot replicate those sounds with the Primacare.  Ten years ago this week I was healing from replacing a heart valve.  Prior to the operation, I could hear the sounds of a defective valve and they are distinctive.  Recently my cardio doc told me not to worry about the existing valve; it is fine and he let me listen and it is fine, especially compared to 2005's sounds.  I could not replicate the sounds of a few days ago on the Primacare.  I heard a shallow sounding heartbeat compared to the full-bodied one in the doc's office.  Maybe another or more expensive scope will do the job.	-1
Its cheaply made and you can barely make anything out. I bought this for my medical kit because my girlfriend and I have a few health issues. I needed to use it on her one night but couldn't hear anything. I'll have to buy something else and toss this one. I need something that's actually going to work in an emergency.	-1
overall this clamp is pretty good. The listing is misleading though. The photo and discription imply that the entire construction is some form of alloy; however when I received mine, the post was made of wood. This is a rather obnoxious oversight in the part of the seller and as such I cannot leave a good rating of this product.	-1
Not a Tight Seal. Get a Wilmad Filter Apparatus instead of one of these Buchner Funnels that don't work Properly at all.  Wilmad Filter Apparatus with Medium Filter Papers. Best Advice! :)	-1
Arrived warped, cracked and pitted. Had to return.  Even if it wasn't messed up physically, the rubber was so hard I doubt it would provide a good seal.  I'd steer clear of this product.	-1
Trash	-1
I owned this funnel for about a month before it broke. To be expected with glass, but this glass feels a little cheap. I got aluminum funnels the second time around (cheaper, more durable, stupid easy to clean).	-1
Funnel is nice but tip was not cut properly and very jagged. It works but as clean as it should be.	-1
Once you install this item and close the cover, good luck trying to open it. It almost feel like it will break. I know it defeats the purpose, that this is not meant to be opened all the time, but when we do testing we struggle to open it and we are afraid it will just break apart. Bas quality product. OK for last minute remediation if you got a violation, but from a functionality standpoint: nah.	-1
Doesn't hold the liquid	-1
I bought this to deter my toddlers from turning on the fireplace.  The design is mediocre at best.  Sharp edges on the product, (cut my self).  The worst part is that the unit attaches to the switch plate with flimsy connectors.  Kids pulled on it because it was Red.  Pulled it off the wall.  Master Lock used to stand for quality.  Somebody at Master Lock missed the mark completely with this product.	-1
This funnel I received has broken stem. Upon closer inspection I noticed a white ring of residue on the inside of the funnel. So not only was it broken, it was used too!	-1
Product arrived broken. Please replace. Thank you	-1
An excellent dust collector. We have two of these. One for our 5" and one for our 7" grinder. Excellent.  Update 20131229: the shroud of the dust buddy on our 5" unit won't stay centered and rubbed against the grinder wheel. Replacement part is $73 and they say it is not covered by warranty despite this being an obvious design flaw. The 7" design is exactly the same so I expect I'll be dealing with the same problems of the shroud and broken neck pieces with this one. In retrospect a plastic unit like this is probably just not a good idea. There are metal ones I've found that sell for less and are better quality. I've reduced my rating down to two stars. I would not buy again.	-1
You need a PROPER dust hood-especially if cutting lead paint. I believe silica-in cement-is a carcinogen too. Do not take a chance as this creates a huge dust storm. I used a 3M NIOSH mask and goggles- both a must, to grind old loose paint off a basement wall for waterproofing and painting. Incredibly difficult job with great results-short of my soreness.  I used a 7"Dewalt grinder and the DustBuddie hood- bad combination, really bad. Diamond wheel recessed in the hood too far and the diamond tool ate the brush on the hood. Huge mess and the hood failed. I contacted Dustless Technologies and they sent a new dust buddie and a shaft-extender- also a bad plan. Shaft extender was eccentric and 3weeks later my shoulders and hands still hurt. No kidding, still have a blister. The hood barely worked, the bearings in the grinder are probably ruined and I nearly choked to death toward the end as the second Dust Buddie rattled to pieces. It was a job I HAD to do by a certain date, so fought through it. Diamond tool and grinder were great-dust Buddie did not.  Do not try this before verifying an un-modified grinder shaft fits your vacuum hood.	-1
They break. Double glove. They break more often as they sit around for months.  A broken glove certainly won't protect you from whatever you were using them for in the first place.	-1
Works great, well-constructed, with no visible flaws.  Update:  I'm downgrading from my previous 5-star 'I Love It' review to 1-star 'I hate it'.  I originally ordered this in May 2013 and was shipped a product by "Scientific Equipment of Houston" (4488 ratings, 99% positive). That funnel was great, nice high walls to hold plenty of liquid, and a flat, smooth bottom for the filter paper to seal against, and smooth, good-quality glaze.  Unfortunately in April 2016, after many successful uses, I broke it (my mistake, not a product flaw, I was interrupted during a hot-filtering procedure and neglected to reheat the funnel before adding hot liquid and the thermal shock cracked the funnel). So I came back to Amazon hoping to get the same item again. I was pleased to see I could just hit the 'buy it again' button without wasting time reading reviews again to find a decent product.  Alas, when the funnel arrived, while it was very well packed, the product itself is low quality. On checking the more closely the vendor has changed, it is now "Scientific Strategies" (448 ratings, 96% positive). My fault I suppose for not realizing that clicking 'buy it again' means 'Buy something similar to this again, possibly from a completely different vendor'. WTF Amazon? Changing companies and products on a listing is completely broken, how long was my 5-star review was attached to this POS product misleading other buyers? If I wanted to take a chance on random quality I'd buy from AliExpress.  Anyway, here's why this new funnel sucks.  The sidewalls are quite short, so the funnel must be refilled more often, a problem that is made even worse if you have a layer of media (sand, diatomite, etc) above the filter. Very tedious to use.  Worse, the bottom is slightly dished so that filter paper will not easily lay flat, so if you use filter paper it wrinkles up around the edges and forms channels around and under the edges of the filter. If you are filtering something water-based It is possible to use the funnel if you poke and stretch the filter paper enough to get it to mostly conform to the dish shape, but that is tedious and seems likely to compromise the filter. If you're filtering solvents that don't make the paper floppy this funnel is completely useless.  Don't bother with with this one, it's cheaper than the other options, but you'll just be trading a few dollars for wasted lab time.	-1
Came broken in middle.	-1
Don't put anything, dangerous, hot, expensive, or important in this.  Will use it to hold empties or for drying.	-1
Sorry but the little tabs on this were broken and this was impossible to put together. I had to send it back. It came flat as others said, but it wouldn't fold up and wouldn't stay together.	-1
This was an okay product they are just so flimsy so be very careful how you handle them they break very easy.	-1
These tongs are just ok - standard student grade.  So to sum it up: They are heavy, the finger loops are small and the gripping surface is a bit thin and stiff.  The bar stock used for these tongs is heavy duty, it's a pretty solid piece of equipment and it works the way I need it to with small and light beakers, especially for the price.  The rivet holding the two scissor jaws together could be more beefy, it doesn't quite feel as solid as the bar stock it's holding together.  I would prefer a screw and lock nut or some other, more solid, replaceable and adjustable assembly hardware - like a C ring.  I'm sure the rivet will hold together fine but I prefer everything to be somewhat over-engineered for peace of mind. I'm not sure such a thing exists as I've never seen what I'm describing as being "better" but there is definitely room for improvement with these.  Also, I have large hands, not freakishly large but larger than average (XL glove size) - The finger loops don't really accommodate more than a couple pincher fingers each.  The weight of the bar stock is pretty heavy by itself so anything you hold in these tongs had better be very light or else you will hurt your fingers and possibly drop whatever you are holding - which defeats the purpose of using tongs to begin with.  I have yet to find a perfect pair of tongs but as I envision them they would probably be...  1. Light weight (reinforced cast aluminum?), 2. Solid assembly (rivet with c ring or screw and adjustable lock nut), 3. Thick rubber padding/tubing on jaws for better grip (thicker and more flexible grip material) 3. Large enough finger loops to accommodate four large fingers on the lower half and one large thumb on the upper half.  These tongs are supposed to replace your hand for holding a hot beaker or flask so that you don't burn yourself, they don't do that extremely well in that they are heavy and unwieldy.  The way they are made they pretty much just replace a couple pinching fingers and yet they are too heavy for the few fingers that fit into the finger loops... poor design.	-1
Not silicone coated as the picture shows.	-1
The tongs are not as shown in the picture.  I am returning these because without the heat-resistant silicone grips (that are shown in the picture) they are just about worthless!	-1
I received my package on the 17th of March and it was empty!	-1
We had complaints of smell after using this low odor Dap.  Its not bonding to marble either we had to re-do an entire install.	-1
I used this foam to seal some gaps around pipes in the basement of my 120-year-old house. Mainly to stop drafts and reduce my heating bill, but if it blocks smoke or slows fire, that is a good thing too. If they called this "smokeblock" it might be closer to the truth than "fireblock" since it is not actually flameproof. In any case, no inspector is going to barge into my old basement to look at my work. I love Great Stuff products, but for my use there is not enough difference in the fire resistance or other behaviors of this compared to their standard foam to justify the much higher cost.	-1
The first one that I received, the battery that was pre-installed in the device, was dead.  There was no insulation protecting the battery contacts, therefore, who knows how long it was running before it finally died.  The replacement that I received, also had a pre-installed battery, and again with no insulator.  The only difference was that this one was not yet dead.  I guess they turned this one off before boxing it up.	-1
The battery door does not fit snugly. I have to hold it with my thumb to get a reading	-1
I rarely see a really bad product that has so many good reviews on Amazon, but this is the one unfortunately. It's accurate and seems like a good caliper until you try replacing coin cell battery. As many reviewers mentioned, once you open it, it will never ever stay closed again. Battery tray is extremely loose and you will loose power in the middle of measurement almost every time... For a disposable caliper it's to expensive, go get a $10 one on eBay and it will work longer!	-1
It drains a Lithium battery, within months, when turned off and not in use.  This is the very same Lithium battery used inside most all laptop computers that is guaranteed to last at least five years and typically more under load.	-1
Worse product to use! All the parts are super sharp, and when you open it to measure, the long thin part stretches out at the bottom, and is also super sharp!  I also bought a nice Digital camera, and had these pieces in a container with some other stuff not realizing how sharp this item was, and it scratched the whole display lens!  So it also damaged my new camera!  Every time I try to use this gauge to measure watch dials, or other things, it keeps poking me, and it hurts.  I don't know why it is so sharp, but it's like a sharp knife on each side, and the end piece that slides out.  Don't get this if you don't want to be poked with a sharp object that can pierce your skin, or damage anything around it!! Wish I could get my money back, and them pay for my new camera!	-1
I got this to repair a few china cups that the handles had broken off.  Worked OK, smelled really bad while it was drying.  It did the job but changes color from a off white to a coffee stain brown shortly after application.  It may gave been the run through the dishwasher or some other external factor but it now looks yucky.	-1
Thought they would be good. We need to use two or three of these to dry our hands. They are rough and do not absorb well.	-1
Well, I've run through what's availabile locally/Amazon and here's my review of the different brand multifold towels.  My review is based on using a SINGLE towel to dry freshly washed (and gently shaked) hands.  Requirement was to have sufficiently dry hands (absorbancy) without easily tearing (durability).  Ratings are 1-5 stars.  I did not factor in price (they are all within ~$10 of each other) or box quantity.  SCOTT Multifold Paper Towels (Amazon) Absorbency: ** (2 stars) Durability: ***** (5 stars) Overall: ** (2 stars) These ranked lowest on absorbency (only wax paper is less absorbent), but high on durability.  Two towels required to sufficiently dry hands, but little/no tearing.  Marathon Multifold Paper Towels (Costco) Absorbency: *** (3 stars) Durability: ** (2 stars) Overall: *** (3 stars) Your average towel.  Med absorbency, med durability.  You effectively needed two towels to dry OR carefully dry with one towel.  Rips easily when wet.  Georgia-Pacific Signature White 2-Ply Premium Multifold Paper Towel (Amazon) Absorbency: *** (3 stars) Durability: *** (3 stars) Overall: *** (3 stars) Very similar to the Marathon in overall performance, slightly more absorbent.  Kimberly-Clark Professional KLEENEX Multifold Paper Towels (Amazon) Absorbency: ***** (5 stars) Durability: ***** (5 stars) Overall: ***** (5 stars) Top of the line.  Excellent absorbency and durability, easily drys hands with one towel without ripping/tearing.  Good comfortable texture and composition, almost approaches fabric in appearance and feel.  As far as I'm concerned, these are the towels by which all others are measured.	-1
This Brand Of Electric Tape is Very Poor. It Does Not Stick Properly. We Will Never Purchase This Product Again.	-1
I have pretty hard water where I live & I tend to get a build-up in the toilet below the water line. The stuff from the market does clean it fairly well but I thought this "Commercial" cleaner would do a better job. I was hoping for less scrubbing & scraping with the pumice block and/or longer lasting results. Well, this stuff didn't do ANYTHING at all. Any ordinary bowl cleaner is better. I wasted my money.	-1
DOESN'T STAY ON RIPS EASILY	-1
My green 30 micron sheet came with a lump in it. Light blue and pink were also creased so badly in the package I couldn't use the middle of the sheets.  The package itself is creased in half, which weakens the paper so you had better plan on using halves instead of a full sheet.  For that reason, these sheets are annoying. I'd rather pay $3 in store for the pack, and get the sheets flat where I can see them beforehand.	-1
I was not very impressed with the performance compared to using the tried and true wet sandpaper method. I was using this polishing paper on plastic so I can't say how it will work on metal but I would not at all recommend you use this on plastic or painted surfaces.	-1
Will not buy again, very cheap and a ONE TIME USE ONLY, but did the trick for my wheels but could have actually used 2 of them as it lasts for only about 2 rims.	-1

I find this patty paper to be thinner and less waxed that the commercial papers I have used.  The meat sticks to the paper and the patties are hard to separate.  There are better choices out there. Wouldn't buy again.	-1
Funny this is the same brand I ordered with my press but this time they got the size right other was 4.75x5. I don't understand some of the complaints about sticking, I always have to defrost my burgers to get apart. Haven't used them yet but guessing they will be no better or worse than paper used in prepared burgers bought in the meat case. Have used them today and all went well, upper/lower sheet keep the press clean and simple to stick in a foodsaver bag for freezing. One thing these came in a box labeled Pattywax Patty Paper made by Bagcraft Papercon. Different than shown bug right and made in USA, wow we make patty paper.  Reordered and again wrong size, not 5.5 square or brand showen, tired of this	-1
I don't get why there are not more poor reviews. These papers are HORRIBLE for freezing. I'm glad I only made 8 burgers to start. I can't even separate them with a knife. There is no noticeable wax in these papers, I might as well have used wet newspaper between the burgers before freezing. Patties will need to be thawed before I can separate them. Don't buy these if you plan on freezing stacked burgers for use one at a time.	-1
I am returning this scope because it either is defective or simply doesn't work well at all. I have been using it to take blood pressure readings. Every now and then I can hear sounds, but most of the time I hear nothing. And yes, I know how to adjust it for using either the bell or diaphragm. Mostly what I hear are the "static" noises of touching the stem or tubing. I've been using it in a quiet environment and my hearing is fine. I can't imagine using this in even a room with A/C running, let alone an ER, unless you are monitoring someone with a very loud heartbeat. My advice is to invest in a top-of-the line Littman, and save your money elsewhere where people's lives aren't at stake. Just put a luggage tag on your Littman so someone doesn't walk off with it! Also, if you buy this, buy directly from Amazon who are better about returns than their associate sellers.	-1
It looks nice but for auscultation purposes it is less than desireable. I generally use ADC brand. Not impressed with this stethoscope and I primarily listen to breath sounds. I would not buy another. Actually looking for something to replace this one with now.	-1
I was encouraged when I received this toothbrush.  Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.  My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife's mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a "clean" mode and a "sensitive" mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.  Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.  The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.  Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars.	-1
You want a mouth massage? Well, this is the toothbrush for you. You want some serious cleaning? You need Philips Sonicare.  There are good things of this toothbrush, but I think the disappointing things outweigh them. For one thing, the brush's head is larger than the Sonicare's. This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.  The one positive thing is the toothbrush's compactness. It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior. But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare.	-1
Didn't work, was jammed shut. I had to pay for return shipping; and NEVER GOT MY MONEY BACK. Ripoff. Might has well have set my money on fire.	-1
The packaging was huge but very safe. The product came in as expected but was low quality. It broke in its first use. I used the halves for a while until they broke as well.	-1
Total scam and a rip off	-1
They are junky, cheaply made and stick.  I would invest in a better quality set, wish there was a better version that was easier to find on Amazon.  I would pay for quality, American made products, not taking a chance with inexpensive junk that doesn't work or last...	-1
I use this set for woodturning and they do a good job.  My only gripe is that, for the money, the adjustment knobs are "cranky" and not very smooth, so it requires some fussing to set dimensions and take readings.  The more expensive versions are smoother and much easier to adjust.  Unless you are really in a budget crunch, spend more $$$ and get a better set... you will have less frustration.	-1
Purchased as a spare part, failed after first use.  Works briefly if you tap on it... makes sparks.  This is one of those projects that takes an hour the first time, but is a snap from then on.  I have done it about 5 times and have it down to about 10 minutes.  You may have to cut off an existing plastic connector and use the included high-temperature wire nuts.  Our oven sees daily use and we have to replace this part every 12-18 months. I keep a spare on hand because it is, by far, the weak link in the design.  If anything goes wrong with the oven, failure to light, smelling gas at startup, I change out this part first.  Note, just because it is glowing does not mean it is working.  The gas valve will only open if the element draws a very specific amount of electrical current, and the element can be slightly high or low and the valve will not open, even though it seems to be glowing properly.	-1
Wobbly and took forever to arrive.	-1
I made the mistake of not listening to the reviews. The wheel I received was unusable. It was not only so far out of balance to make it horribly dangerous, it was also out of alignment making it unstable left and right. I will try to return, but not sure its worth it because of the return shipping.	-1
This came improperly packaged as another reviewer noted. That is dangerous as a crack could cause an explosion when the wheel gets up to speed. Mounted the wheel using feeler gages to get it as centered as possible on a 5/8" shaft. The grinder and pedestal took off across the shop.  The wheel had side to side wobble of 3/16" and a very heavy spot. The plastic nested bushings should be outlawed. Placed the original made in china OEM wheel on the grinder and no vibration.  The grinder shaft and flanges dial indicated to .006" maximum runout, very acceptable. The Norton wheel is USA priced made in Mexico trash. Norton used to be one of the best. Amazon customer service was very good in handling this. They apologized for something that wasn't an Amazon fault. A return was issued immediately. I will continue purchasing from Amazon. I will never again purchase Norton products.	-1
Can't recommend it...just a cheap chinese knock off of the real product.  It won't last more than a few days in the weather.	-1
My kit sat on a shelf for a couple years before I needed it, then when used the self-stick adhesive did not perform as claimed. I recommend storing these in the freezer until needed.	-1
Didn't work at all I wouldn't recommend it. To trying it three or four times longus it lasted without peeling off was an hour	-1
I don't know about Gorilla, more like spit glue, it works ok for certain jobs and works horrible for big ones.  Disappointed in this tape. i think i used duct tap that had a stronger hold than this.	-1
It did not stick all that great. I expected more from Gorilla!	-1
Screen is extremely difficult to read. Micro-switch (on/off) works poorly. No blue clips provided for quick connects	-1
When this item arrived one of the wires was pulled out of the pin on the plug. Being a technician, I repaired it with solder and it worked normally until today. The OUT sensor stopped working. I'm very disappointed in this product.	-1
I bought this brand of toothpaste in the Fennel flavor because I do not like to use mint, which counteracts the effects of homeopathic remedies. I had assumed, based on past reputation, that Tom's toothpaste contained only safe, healthy ingredients. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I am very sorry I did not look up the current ingredients before purchasing this product, because there are some questionable ingredients, in particular, carrageenan and sodium lauryl sulfate. I have listed all the ingredients below, and included descriptions of the objectionable ones.  I will not be purchasing this brand again.  Calcium carbonate, water, glycerin, sodium bicarbonate, xylitol, carrageenan, natural flavors, sodium lauryl sulfate, stevia rebaudiana extract (stevia), commiphora myrrha resin extract (myrrh) and propolis cera (from bees).  Carrageenan: This is a common food additive which is extracted from a seaweed commonly known as Irish moss. Carrageenan is used as a thickener and emulsifier to improve the texture of processed foods. For some time now, research has indicated it produces&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/inflammation/dp/B000P0JGLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">inflammation</a>&nbsp;in the body, which is considered to cause or contribute to every known disease.  Natural Flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: "The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate: Thousands of studies have indicated the toxicity of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). It is a detergent, surfactant, and emulsifier found in cosmetics, toiletries and household and industrial cleansers. This chemical is linked to nitrosamines, which are dangerous carcinogens that increase the body's tendency to absorb nitrates, which are also known carcinogens.	-1
We have used many Jason products safely and have become a fan. However, there is something with these new formulas for kids' toothpaste that is going the wrong path. We have noticed allergic reactions.  The ingredients are: Glycerin, aqua (purified water), silica, xylitol, xanthan gum, panthenol, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, calendula officinalis flower extract, calcium carbonate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, natural flavor * certified organic vegetable source. It seems that we might be allergic to sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, which is used in lieu of sodium lauryl sulfate as a replacement surfactant.  For future orders we shall cross off this toothpaste in our shopping list.	-1
I bought a large bag of these a few years ago to attach to my rain barrels. As of this spring, every single one of them is BROKEN. This is simply because plastic bulkhead fittings, when yanked on via the hose in any way, will break.  So now I've switched to brass bulkhead fittings exclusively. The brass fittings can even be used in barrels that once had plastic bulkheads that broke and started leaking. The brass fittings are simply much, much tougher.  I suppose that if you never plan to move your rain barrels, these are fine. But any tugging on those hoses, in my experiences, can bust these plastic bulkhead fittings. So they're simply no cut out for the task of tapping a rain barrel.	-1
This toothpaste did not deliver any noticeable whitening for me. Also I did not enjoy the hydrogen peroxide taste. The mint flavoring was not strong enough to mask the hydrogen peroxide taste nor was it strong enough to even freshen my breath. The tube is made of thick rigid plastic and difficult to squeeze the product out. Also, this is pretty expensive compared to other toothpastes. If you want real whitening, try whitening strips or get Zoom whitening from your dentist. I get Zoom from my dentist when I need instant whitening. Then I use Crest White Strips to maintain my teeth's whiteness afterwards. I am able to maintain very white teeth with this regimen despite that I regularly enjoy  coffee, tea, red, tomato sauce, and soy sauce. I don't see the point of this toothpaste. It comes in fancy packaging, is expensive, tastes gross, and doesn't do enough of what it's supposed to do. Overall, I do not recommend this product.	-1
This toothpaste took some getting used to because it doesn't have a very strong minty taste and contains peroxide. After using it for about a month, I haven't noticed any big difference in the whitening of my teeth, which is what it claims to do. Perhaps by the time I finish the tube I will see some noticeable difference.  But two other things concern me with this product. First is the price of over $6 per tube for less than 3 ounces of paste. I agree with others that the tube does contain lots of air, which certainly makes it feel like you're getting more than what it actually contains. There are plenty of other whitening toothpastes that cost much, much less.  The second thing that concerns me is where this is manufactured. The label states that it is "Distributed by...", so my guess is that it is made overseas someplace. Remember the toothpaste scare three years ago from the stuff made in China? Since that time, I've tried my best to check toothpaste and other oral hygiene products to find out if they're made in the US. While this certainly doesn't guarantee that the product will always be safe, it definitely makes me feel safer. I will pass on future purchases of this product and stick with American made Aquafresh. Not only does it taste better, but it is much, much less expensive.	-1
I really wanted to like this product ... I really did. But my mouth never really felt clean after using it. I'm sure my teeth / mouth **were** clean, because I kept brushing and brushing to try to get that "clean" feeling -- but that clean feeling never came.  Second, while considering the overall product, I also didn't care for the tube design.  Most toothpaste tubes will compress and stay compressed as you use the product. However, this tube is made of a thick plastic that returns to its normal shape after you squeeze out what you want. My question: For what purpose?  It might make for a standardized appearance and look nicer on a bathroom counter (and therefore also serve as an ongoing advertisement for the company), but for practical purposes it's hard to tell when the tube is running low, and it becomes more difficult to squeeze out product as you go.  Third, the product smells just like Pepto-Bismal ... not exactly a smell I want to experience when starting my day.  Even though I didn't like this toothpaste after the first week, out of fairness I forced myself to keep with it for a few more weeks, thinking maybe it would grow on me.  It didn't.  I realize other folks enjoy this product, but I'm rating it as "blech" and giving it one star.	-1
Haven't received it yet but I found out that this is falsely advertised. It has a 4,000# MAXIMUM WORKING LOAD LIMIT with a 10,000# BREAKING STRENGTH.  Here is the product page from the manufacturer  [...] it is the WS20HD0600 2"x20' heavy duty winch strap.  Don't buy this thinking it will withstand more than 4000 lbs!	-1
I purchased this to seal a small hole in a rubber pig. The product description said it could be used on rubber so I decided to give it a try. My Dobie's favorite toy is a pink rubber pig that squeaks. One day I noticed that he was pulling out the pig's insides through a small tear in the side. Because it is such a tiny tear I did not think there woud be any harm in using an adhesive. When I received this Loctite I read all the information on the back of the package. There are a lot of directions and a good bit of technical data. There is a section labeled "DANGER" that warns of the various dangers of using this product.  One of the warnings is that inhaling the vapor may be harmful or fatal. There is a "WARNING" that states "This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer, etc". Obviously I can not use this on the pig that my Dobie carries in his mouth.  I give this one star based solely on my inability to use this item for the reason it was purchased. I have no other need for this item. One star is probably not fair but it is the only rating I can give based on my lack of usage due to the severe warnings. I have no doubt that there are situations where this product can be safely used but I do not have such a need.	-1
Bottle arrived wrapped in bubble wrap, but that didn't keep it from having an inch-long crack up the side.  Given the fact that I shelled out 5 bucks for what is likely a 50-cent item from China, this is unacceptable.  Go to your local drugstore and buy a good one.  That's what I ended up doing.	-1
tears uneven to often	-1
Ordered thinking this was a more solid product, Like a soft rubber, its not its play dough. But my mistake. But the real bummer is when i received my package it was completely smashed like a pancake.	-1
It was shipped to me melted together. Otherwise it did work as intended.	-1
TOO MANY LARGE PINS..  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.  $ WAS RIGHT. PLASTIC BOX CHEAPLY MADE FO TH WEIGHT OF PINS.  MY MISTAKE ON THIS PURCHASE.  MORE JUNK FOR THE GARAGE.  ,MAY BE OF USE FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS, NOT ME.	-1
Instead of the blue Rockler brand gauge shown, I received a white Drillspot brand gauge with a large label covering the gauge markings. The label was the kind with permanent adhesive. Attempting to remove the label left most of the label and adhesive stuck to the gauge. Using a chemical to remove the label might remove the painted gauge markings or damage the plastic. I contacted the seller (Drillspot) to give them a chance to fix the problem before I left negative feedback. They declined to take any corrective action and said to let Amazon deal with the problem.  The plastic gauge shipped loose without any type of packaging. With Drillspot's logo, phone and web address printed in large type on the gauge, it appears to be the type of giveaway item you get free at trade shows.	-1
My new review: This is Chinese junk.  After a couple years, it won't turn on anymore, despite trying several new batteries.  It's dead.  I hardly ever used it.  Next time I'm buying the Japanese Mitutoyo brand.	-1
not even close was to be 7/8 OD and 5/8 ID it's 29/32 OD so like .917 should be .875  ID is like  .582 should be .6325  not happy at all	-1

Got my money back because the product did not do the job I expected.	-1
I think someone needs to check their measurements. .02" thick - more like .06" thick. Way to thick to be of use.	-1
I am very disappointed with this fitting. It's probably my own fault for not reading the description right. It reduces the water flow from 1/2 inch down to 1/4 inch. The fitting is made of high quality material which is very thick and durable, but restricting the water flow is unacceptable. Next time I will buy the fitting with 1/2" NPY male and 3/4" barb.	-1
Disappointing. Not exactly as pictured. Cheap and very light weight.	-1
Mine arrived broken! Enough said!	-1
Extremely thin, I would say paper thin but a typical sheet of paper is far thicker.  Stickiness is only medium to low.  Not at all to be considered standard (where is that found any more??) "duct tape".	-1
cheap made	-1
I bought these to fit over my 1-1/2 inch pool hoses and they do not fit. They are too small !	-1
About 1/3 - 1/2 of these clamps failed at the point of installation. I would turn the screw and it would tighten for a while but when I made the "last" turn to make it as tight as I could (where the adjusting screw doesn't turn any more), the screw would just turn freely and the pressure exerted by the clamp would disappear. I've never had a radiator clamp strip before and I'm not a super strong twister of screws. So I was pretty surprised at the rate of failure. I bought several different boxes and several different sizes and had the same general experience with all sizes and lots.  I don't know the nature of the failure. And I don't know whether the clamps that didn't strip are durably strong. But I use them mainly to connect pipe and fittings in an underground irrigation systems. So the cost of fixing a broken clamp is very high in terms of lost water, time to locate the leak, time to dig up the joint and time to redo the original job. I sympathize with the reviewer who lost an engine using these. These clamps have a low price but are very expensive in the long run.	-1

Can't tighten them tight enough without them stripping out.	-1
Rusted pretty bad in a boat, Had to replace them.	-1
When you try to tighten them, they all bend and collapse. So anything under 1/2in OD will be too small for the clamp.	-1
VERY NARROW--NOT VERY STRONG	-1
Be Aware!! This one is very skinny!! I didn't notice it said 5/16" wide. I assumed it would be the same width as all the others I have!! Probably won't use the whole box now...	-1

I ordered two of these, with the idea to compare temperatures inside my camping van to the temperatures outside, to track the progress of my insulation project. However, prior to setting them up, I set them onto the table next to me at my desk, and they've been there for at least half an hour. One of the units reads that the current temperature is 78F and the other says 83F. Their humidity readings are at 37% and 34%.  Granted, one of the units was shipped to me in a very battered box and had clearly been used before, so that may be a factor. The one that was in the battered box and used, the two halves of the device fit together nice and snugly, however the one that was new, the clip that holds the two halves together, lets them flop around a bit -- when the protective cap over the display is on, it takes up the slack, and there's no more wiggling.  The product seems like it could be nice, maybe I just got one (or two?) bad units?	-1

The White drying Gorilla Glue is worthless, it won't stick to or bond anything.  It doesn't even stick to itself very well.  Drys flaky between items to be bonded as easily demonstrated when it FAILS to bond them together.  Tried on plastic to plastic, wood to plastic, plastic to metal, metal to metal, and wood to brick.  Failed EVERY time with every project.  Tossed remaining 1/2 of it away after 2nd failure of plastic to plastic. Yes, I DID moisten surfaces lightly!!  To it's credit, it does foam up nicely and make quite an attractive mess.  If you need a polyester/polyurethane or non-mix type epoxy try Elmer's Ultimate&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elmer-s-Ultimate-Glue-P9417-16Oz-Ultimate-Poly-Glue/dp/B000MVOXGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elmer's Ultimate Glue - P9417 16Oz Ultimate Poly Glue</a>&nbsp;or Elmer's Glue All Max&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elmer-s-E9416-All-Purpose-Glue-All-Max-8-Ounces/dp/B0045PS6K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elmer's E9416 All Purpose Glue-All Max, 8 Ounces</a>&nbsp;.  Both are far superior to this product.  Worst in a mediocre line of "Gorilla" products.  AVOID!!	-1
Glue was dried up	-1
It does quite well, what a glue does best---glue ! Odd to me, activated when glue applied only to WET surface, then it EXPANDS before getting hard. Example-glued handle to broom end, and glue expanded a lot, squeezing out around joint. Required sanding that off, for appearence.  Example--glued broken porcelain chip piece to toilet tank cover...used very little glue, BUT glue expanded and raised chip slightly above crack area---whereas piece fit perfectly before the glue, and could not see any broken area. Now stuck with this slightly raised chip, above tank top----not perfect. The glue does great holding job & wanted something besides epoxy for general use. Will be looking for a more NORMAL acting glue to replace it. Just use very little glue, wet surfaces, and best to clamp pieces together or use heavy weight-----this might keep glue from doing excessive expanding. I will NOT recommend this glue or give it more stars, because before bought it, was not told about wetting surfaces or expanding problem of glue. Use sparingly, for sure.  /  BTW - not bought @ Amazon....Note; the Gorilla TAPE is very good...it sticks better than duct tape, especially in wet weather. 6/27/2014  ---  TOOK OFF AS MANY STARS AS POSSIBLE....the expanding property of this glue has messed up most repaired things.  If glue expanding so much is okay for your use, THEN I'd rank it as GREAT !  I'm old fashioned -- just want stuff to stick together without, for whatever reason it does, bubbling up...forcing pieces to spread apart. ALSO, any glue that has bubbled out by the joint, has to be sanded away---which is hard and ackward to do, if not impossible.  IN OTHER WORDS...0 stars.	-1
Hillman group normally supplies great stuff, but the galvanized coating on these bolts is so heavy that the specified 1/4-20 nuts jam in the first 2 threads.  With a headless carriage bolt, that means you can't just muscle through it...the bolt turns and cannot be tightened.	-1
Not a fan of these, the plastic is very thin and not of good quality and can break easily when you're trying to close the connector and get a good seal Overprices ones from RadioShack are of much higher quality, and those have two metal pieces to make contact with the wire you're tapping, this product only has one such metal piece  don't get me wrong, they do work, but there's better stuff out there, I wouldn't trust something like this in my car, broke a couple when installing, will look for another brand next time and avoid these 100pack cheapies	-1
Had to remove heat shrink from around ring.... on every terminal.... what a waste of time	-1
I believed these to be heat shrink, however they do shrink but almost melt before they bubble up and char	-1
suction good, but so loud, I could not finish cleaning my five room house before my ears were killing me. My hearing was deadened for at least an hour and ears ringing for far longer. Must have been defective. I sent it back immediately. I was extremely disappointed, as I have wanted an Oreck upright for many years. This unit was many, many times louder than my chainsaw.  Close to a jet engine, close up!	-1
this vac picks up okay, it is satisfactory, not at all superior as most reviews claim.  It picks up well if you put a new bag after each and every time you vacum, just once.  And it started smelling up my whole house with a really nasty smell after the 3rd time I cleaned. I bout extra bags with the deodorizing tablets with I change each vacuum, but the smell is still unbearable.  I would not reccomend this cleaner at all. I say spend a ;little more and get a better piece of eqipment.  I am not kidding you when I say it smells horrible!  Plus I discovered I do want attacments, I thought I could go without them, but I have corners and places that need asn attachment.  It leaves a path close to the baseboards it will not get to. I am not at all happy with this product.	-1
I love oreck products but this one is a bad quality!	-1
I don't know if it works or not. This is not the product I received	-1
Wasn't able to use because it wasn't exactly the color I needed but that was my fault.  The packaging says 3M, but it sure doesn't look and feel like the 3M quality I'm use to.  I did try a small piece of it and it seemed to tear very easy which made me question the durability.	-1
these are really not something I would use if I needed real protection.. they're very flimsy and even dust can pass thru them	-1
Not to happy with this. Does not deburr Aluminum very well in both directions. Works great one direction but not both. It digs in to much.	-1
I was confused when I looked in the package and saw a bunch of loose backer rod. I specifically ordered from this vendor because each item is  shown on a cardboard roll. Unless it's buried in the text somewhere, I see no mention of a description other than what is shown. For me , I have  trouble keeping a 25 ft. extension cord straight, and these are 100 ft. long. Also, the roll was ordered for easy storage and to keep the product  from tangling. So much for planning. I think Amazon needs to modify this vendors ad so others will know what they're getting. And just so you  know, this vendor's only warning of this material being loose is on your invoice, of course at that point, you've already placed your order. Now,  when do I check my invoice? When there's a problem, like now.	-1
Hard to use.  The Schraeder side is very shallow, it's hard to see when it is properly engaged.  Broke after about a year.  Should last a lot longer for this price.	-1
This gauge is terrible. It's foil faced bezel is just glued on. Mine has peeled off and the accuracy is not even close. Nothing is better then an analogue gauge and if you use a schrader valve. just get an adapter. This has the ability to test both, but I wouldn't trust it on my bicycle if I was going for a long ride.	-1
Ten readings taken one after the other yield ten different values varying by 10 PSI up and down. Unit must be allowed to turn itself off (time out) before a new reading is taken. Absolute junk.	-1
I was unpleasantly surprised to see the Spotnails packaging label list in bold "304 Stainless Steel" when that important stainless steel information should have been in the description and the sales image. IMHO this borders on false advertising!  These are 304 - I was hoping for 316 stainless steel like the 2" Bostitch brand ordered together with these.  Anyone ordering stainless steel materials should be informed of the quality. A simple way to 'somewhat' determine the quality of stainless steel is to try and lift or roll the item from side to side with a powerful magnet. The lesser amount of iron, 316 for instance, the better for marine or severe environment service. 316 stainless steel is practically non-magnetic. The lower the number, as in 304, the more iron therefor the more it is attracted to a magnet. A powerful magnet will lift these bards easily as seen in my attached photo.  I purchased both 3/4" and 1" sizes, both appear to be 304 stainless steel as is properly labeled on their packaging, unfortunately nowhere was this information to be found on the Amazon site at the time I purchased 10/15/2015.  In addition these were ordered early in the day for 'Same Day' delivery as described at checkout. I received a confusing email that they were delayed while the Amazon site still showed 'before 9pm' same day! I could have driven across town and purchased from a brick and mortar shop but paid more on Amazon to save time on a time sensitive project! I called but the rep was unable to offer any solutions. Not the first time this has happened...  Slowly loosing my faith in Amazon Prime's advantages!!!	-1

The name is ironic....with a name like rectorseal you think the item would stay sealed during shipping. I received a giant mess and an empty bottle. Since it is a chemical i could not return or even get a refund. Buyer beware	-1
I've had mine for a while and they are extremely useful for steel or even woodwork, just zero it and go. I'd give the quality about a 7 on a 10-point scale. However, this one eats batteries like candy. I have to install a new button battery and use it, probably for the duration of the job (say 2-3 days, haven't measured that), but it will be dead every last time when I want it again a few weeks later and I will have to install another battery. There are other angle gauges that take 9-volt batteries and are more durable and hold their charge for much, much longer.	-1
These do not fit blade fuse blocks and are not as pictured.	-1
Check your fuses before buying this because its not in the description that it doesn't work with all mini fuses. I didn't even realize this until I got it. Now I have to make a special trip to the store for some * mini fuses that will work with this. Not what I was expecting to deal with when this arrived. Here is the other one that will work for me: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U61OM0W?psc=1	-1
Requires a fuse to work, which is not provided. I assumed the fuse slot was to relocate the fuse you are replacing with this plug, but there are 2 slots, the second is for your new wire-tap I was connecting a product with a fuse in it, so didn't need another fuse in series. Since I didn't have a fuse, stalled my project	-1
This missed a 5 star rating as ALL of the tubes I got were marked GREY but the product in a couple of the tubes was WHITE. Had to go over the white with the grey. Terrible product control. Self leveling yes but can be very messy. It will also take a huge amount of this product if you have a deep gap as it seeps down to infinity.	-1
Soft as painters cocking. It is not useful when sanding and painting is the next step. Perhaps as a breast implant... ;)	-1
I've used BASF SL-1 that I purchased at a local concrete supply store in the big tube. I have also purchased a concrete sealer from one of the big box stores in the the 10oz tube, can't remember the name. I could not tell the difference between the two. They came out of the tube slightly runnier than caulk and almost immediately "melted". Very liquid. Like water without the surface tension. It would almost climb the walls of the crack and leave a slightly concave fill. Perfect.  This product by Dap is not the same. If there was some kind of SAE, ISO, or ANSI standard for calling something "self leveling" this product would not meet it. It leaves a dome wherever I used it. You have the choice of a dome that will catch on your shovel, snowblower, or whatever you might drag across your driveway, or not filling the hole completely.  The only plus of the this product is that it has virtually no odor.	-1
Water based.  Water dissoves it. It will be washed away by water after it drys, if it drys. Has consistency of plain yogurt. (In fact, plain Yogurt drys faster and makes a better sealant.)  Do not use in bathroom.  Do not use in humid climate.  Do not use near water.  Never get water on it.	-1
I have grouted before. I followed the product directions to the letter. Made sure the applied gout cured for over 72 hours. One week later and the grout is coming off. Very disappointing as I spent several hours applying the grout and was unable to use the primary bathroom for 3 days. Now I have to do the work all over again. This time I will use standard grout.	-1
I purchased this set at a very large discount. The one that I received was comprised of both Brazilian and Mexican-made files. I got them cheap enough that I really can't complain, but they certainly would have went straight back had I paid anything near to full price. The deficiencies in workmanship were quite evident.	-1
This toothpaste has fluoride in it which is shown to cause cancer and lowers IQ. This defeats the whole purpose of natural toothpaste.  If you Google "fluoride causes cancer and lowers IQ" you can find studies.	-1
I would not buy this again, it does not really fit the tube of my cardio stethoscope. It's made of plastic, just not very useful	-1
I bought these to replace a box of painters gloves I had been using for light yard work. The other gloves would tear in the finger area after about 10 minutes. But I was done by then so no big deal. The toughest part with these gloves is getting them on without tearing the cuffs.  That must be why they come in packs of 100?!?  They fit tight in the finger area and loose on the cuff. That means debris from whatever you're using them for will fall into the palm area. Unfortunately just gentle use on non-rough surfaces caused the palm area to tear. Within a few more movements the fingers tore as well.  Today I tried a pair on again to pick up some small twigs and they literally tore apart at the palm by me simply flattening my hand out. I then put another pair on and a small thorn on a twig went straight through and cut my finger. I guess that answers the question about punctures.  Any glove that tears this easily by standard hand motions would make me uneasy about trusting them for anything medical. I now feel really cheated as I could have replaced them with 100ct painters gloves for only $4.	-1
I ordered 342ppm and instead received 1000ppm solution.  My meter only goes up to 999ppm so it's a bit of a guess at this point.  I calibrate to 999 with the hope that the solution is really 1000 and not 1030 or some other close number.	-1
thin and soft steel rim, curved on first use AND CAME APART OF RUBBER TIRE !	-1
Glue does not dispense both sides in equal amounts. It dispenses more on one side and results in an mixture that takes a very long time to set.	-1
Mainly reaping/sealing the tube after use is useless. The JB Weld product provides a much better full proof seal. Otherwise I guess it works ok but the advertised strength of it is less than JB Weld. I won't be reordering this or another Gorilla glue products because all I have used have not measured up to other like products I have used. I know it's just a personal preference and maybe yours will be different.	-1
This "3-pack" is a misleading description. There were 3 packs but the contents of one entire tube leaked out and caused me to throw all of them away as the contents has been soaked in epoxy. This was a complete waste of money. Look elsewhere.	-1
This stuff takes over an hr to set up, meaning you have to hold it in place the whole time. It doesn't get hot to set up like all epoxies I've used in the past. It's just a two part glue.	-1
Zero stars if I could!	-1
Both packages of product arrived leaking. After cleaning them up I mixed up some as per instructions. The label claims it's a "5 minute" cure time. 90 minutes later it's still gooey	-1
Not happy with this product at all. Doesn't set well and difficult to even remove cap.  I would not recommend this product.	-1
Have not used yet. Epoxy in general does a great job, when I use it. It seems that once you open a tube, it can't really be used again if you recap it.  Don't know when I'll be using this, but certainly will UPDATE my experience of it.	-1
I'm no stranger to epoxies and have been a fan of Gorilla glues for years. That's why this epoxy is such a disappointment. Followed the instructions, applied, waited the 5 minutes setting time and...nothing. Kept clamping for another 10 mins. Nothing. Cleaned up everything, and then reapplied. Waited clamped for a good 15 minutes. Nothing. No setting and therefore no adhesive. Finally at another job where the epoxy was in a bevel where it stayed on, it cured a few hours and totally cured in a day. Again, I've used epoxies before and I followed directions. This is just not a good product.	-1
Decent, but tufts of steel wire fall out.	-1
The brass on these is very brittle. It will work, but the wood must be soft and drilled perfectly, or pre-threaded.	-1
I bought this to use with E-Z LOK's brass threaded inserts to attempt to install them by hand (I've been using the drill press method to make sure they go in straight) but this tool is complete garbage. The wings that are supposed to fit in the threaded insert's slot are severely undersized with way too much slop. They don't stay in the recess when attempting to install the inserts; it just slips out. Trying to use a bit more pressure when turning the inserts results in the slots breaking and rendering the insert useless.  The big problem is how undersized the wings on the bit are. If they were sized to match the insert slot they would probably work great.  So instead of this tool, I recommend the drill press method. Doing it that way ensures the inserts go in straight and without breaking.	-1
wrong size	-1
Kreg is over priced they are regular screws nothing exiting	-1
Broke after six months of use. Awful.	-1
Compared to modern home AV systems, my flat panel TV/audio system is fairly primitive...an old NAD stereo receiver connected to two fairly decent speakers.  That worked fine until I bought a new TV and forgot to check that it included right and left channel audio output jacks...it didn't.  Hooking the audio output from my cable box to the stereo was a poor solution; there was significant delay between the cable box output and the picture on the screen.  Everything was out of sync by at least a quarter of a second.  This Decoder provided the solution.  Connecting to the TV's optical audio output, I was able to hook up to my old amp through the decoder and was shortly back in business.  It couldn't have been easier.  By using the TV's output, the delay between the audio and video was eliminated.  Even better, everything I now show on the TV, regardless of the input source, has the associated audio fed out through the optical connector.  A couple of reviews have commented on the reliability (or lack thereof!) of this product.  My unit does run a bit warm on the outside.  Since it's a plastic housing, which doesn't conduct the heat well, it's liable to be pretty hot on the inside.  I suspect that's the source of some of the reliability problems.  Only time will tell.  Highly recommended...at least so far...  Update - 4/22/11 - My unit did fail.  The company quickly replaced it under the warranty.  From the comments on the paperwork, it looks like there have been some engineering changes since my original unit was manufactured.  Hopefully that permanently fixes the problem.  As long as you order from a vendor that turns over its inventory, anything that you order today should incorporate the update.  Update - 6/2/11 - It died again.  Sigh.  I give up and am going to buy an A/V receiver with built-in optical inputs.  Changing this review from five down to two stars.	-1
Medium to weak suction, disposable bags run close to $5.00 each in three packs, overall not a good buy.	-1
I have changed my rating of this vacuum after owning it for over a year. The main problem is that it tips over easily and spills water everywhere. I am looking for something a bit more stable to replace it with. Not recommended.	-1
Looks great, has great attachments but the suction is less to be desired.	-1
Bought it six months ago and today it died	-1
Noisy, noisy, noisy.  I'm talking seriously noisy.  And the jury is out on the bag.  It is very large before placing it in the vacuum, and then it gets totally scrunched when installing.  The Stanley rep said just stick in and you are good to go. ?  After using the first time, I opened the vacuum and found the bag in the same scrunched position.  I can't imagine it holding anywhere near the amount that its size promises.  And did I mention that it is extremely noisy? Given the Costco cost, I'll keep it and probably wear ear protectors the next time that I use it.  Picks up the dirt off the garage floor, but poorly designed.  The 10 foot cord will get you nowhere.  Extension cord a must.  Going to Goodwill.  Constantly tips over, and the bags really are a pain.  Terrible product.	-1
does not fit...too large....can not be pentak original	-1
This O-Ring was larger in diameter and DID NOT fit my big blue filter bowl properly.  Luckily I had a original o-ring available to compare and it was noticeably smaller.  I would not recommend you buy this.  I tried to fit it in the bowl and it wasn't a very good fit.	-1
Arrived with no lid. Pretty good and solid but needed a lid for dust collection. Useless without it for me. Will have to return. 1 star until I get a bucket with a lid. The description clearly stated a lid was included.	-1
Although i got the right looking bottles with wide tip (from eclectic supply seller) these are the cheapest quality bottles i have ever bought! and they all look the same but, yet all have various number identification codes on bottom which are so roughed up/gluey like looking that i had to get a bright light and a magnifying glass to even see the hidden number codes that the melted plastic/glue like surface (that is also inside bottom of bottles and on side of some bottles where material meets to seal them close) is obsecuring. These are NOT all #4 "Natural LDPE Plastic" as listed, i received: 3 - #6 (POLYSTYRENE) 1- #4 (LDPE) 2- #7 (MIXED/OTHER) 6- #8 (last i checked there are NO 8's and these clearly say 8, so who knows what it is made with)  so out of bunch of 12, only ONE bottle is supposably LDPE. Don't know what others are receiving but, i personally can't see using what i received to hold liquids/etc that i will be consuming.. the only good thing about these bottles IF not for food use, is the caps close tightly and the dropper tips snap into bottle neck well and no leaks (except from tip hole itself). it is a shame the plastic bottles themselves are so cheap, they would of been great otherwise!	-1
It showed sign of degrading six month later. The new cost now $64... well, time to return the replacement.	-1
Listed as 4 ft by 6 ft, which in my book is 48 x 72 inches. Mat measures 45x69. Needed it for a specific space where it matters. Put an accurate measurement on your products for crying out loud. It ain't brain surgery.	-1
Love the numbers - but the nails? Why in the world would you provide non-galvanized nails to hang them with? The nails are coated with black paint that chips as you nail the numbers in place, which then leads to rusting.	-1

Junk! Clips come apart from boot very easily. Not worth the hassle of returning them.	-1
These are good probes and all, but they didn't actually fit the Amprobe AM-510 I bought along with them.  They're loose and tend to fall out easily.  Weird.  They do fit a little better in a Wavetek meter I have.  I dunno.	-1
The conection in the multimeter amprobe or fluke is very weak . I think the inside of male conector was not good built.. The alligators are good for  my job . I did this , I inserted a very tiny screwdriver into the male conector and twisted carefully each segment of the conector  until you can see something like  "flower ", with this you can connect inside of female conector inside of your multimeter and you feel more tight it . I think this is not  full quality process by AMPROBE ,the point  of  conection, , ... This is the most important funtion of any  leads... the  reliable  function......Like a customer , nobody  must change or fix the a item purchased with  good control quality	-1
Very Cheap tape	-1
AWFUL - Has none of the adhesive qualities of the "DUCK" brand or other DUCT TAPE.  Stuck it on, and off it came.  Placed it, and a few drops of water, and it came completely off.  Also, not very wide.  don't waste your money, thinking you are getting a deal with this amazon price.	-1
They look like the typical push-on alligator clips commonly shipped with DMMs from the major manufacturers like Fluke, Extech, and Ideal.  However these are poorly designed imitations.  The push on receptacles are completely different from other designs.  The common decent quality push on connectors are round (quazi-cone shaped) holes that are large enough to receive the test lead pin easily and without missing.  They get tighter at the tips to hold the test lead.  These are designed with a small round hole that is tight...  So small and tight in fact that you have to visually inspect the probe and attempt to insert the probe though this tiny hole.  And assuming you actually make it and insert the probe in this very tight receptacle...you end up stretching it and shortening it's usable life.  Honestly, don't waste your money.  Spend a little more and buy a name brand.	-1
Poorly made and don't fit correctly on various leads I tried them on they fit too loose, spend an extra 5 dollars and get a set of leads with alligator clips.	-1
These clips are pushed/forced on to the male tips of the respective cables. As such, they can separate from the cable without much stress. So you can use them in work bench situations but I wouldn't use them elsewhere such as in a crawl space or attic.	-1
Never even used it and it's garbage. I took these out of the package and attempted to attach them to my meter. The red one is ok but the black one just falls off. I removed the clip from the boot to try and crimp the sleeve so I could get it to stay attached, to complete the project I ordered them for. The metal is so thin and weak that I gave up and tossed it in the trash. You wouldn't think it would matter much with these, but you really do get what you pay for.	-1
I just got these from UPS a few minutes ago.  Unfortunately, I'm already creating a return label.  These go on, if you don't have anything at an angle.  That'd be great if I never had to lean over and test wires coming out of a wall for a border light, outlet, etc.  But, i can't have them sliding off, or it makes it more difficult than holding two test leads in the multimeter in the first place.  I'd keep these on with electrical tape, but then i'd have to keep taping/un-taping every time i needed the leads to fit into a socket or a tight spot.  Overall, great idea, poor design.	-1
Complete waste of money. They do not fit at all on my different probes, either you can't get the test lead tip in the alligator metal receptacle and or the rubber sleeve doesn't fit and they fall off. Cheap but worthless, buy Fluke or a name brand which you will have to do anyway after you throw these in the garbage.	-1
These are seriously the lowest-quality bearings I've ever bought.  I bought them for fidget spinners but I wouldn't even use them in kids skate/skateboard wheels.  I tried everything to get them spinning well:  Removing the shields, cleaning with acetone, alcohol, limonene, soap & water, etc etc.  I also tried various types of lubrication (oil, grease, or none at all).  These things are just plain JUNK.  Even fresh out of the box you can hear them clicking as they turn due to scratches/imperfections in the *supposedly brand new* ball bearings.  The retaining clips inside (that hold the bearings inside) are an odd transparent brown color that I've never seen before (I've taken apart thousands of bearings in my life; normally they're white/"natural" nylon colored or metal)...  Like they were permanently stained by rust or something.  I suspect that these bearings are made from rejects at some factory and the internal retention/spacer clips were pulled from some batch that was recovered from a flood zone.  They're also a fraud!  The metal shields claim these bearings are ABEC-9 but they are most certainly not!  ABEC-9 bearings would not have as much "play" as these hunks of junk.  Shields or no shields these things just plain *wobble* and if you spin them fast enough (e.g. with an air compressor like I used to test them) they *literally fall apart*.  I'm never going to find those ball bearings that flew across my garage.  That was with like 3 seconds of compressed air.  A normal ABEC-9 bearing would be able to hold strong (getting a little hot) while being spun by compressed air no matter how long you spun it.  Avoid these bearings or just use them as weights if you have that kind of fidget spinner.	-1
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. These bearings are of very poor quality. The races are not evenly machined and are soaked with heavy grease. They do not work even after cleaning and lubrication. Making loud noises with bad variation. The product picture is identical with another vendor with a much better quality product, be careful.	-1
These cost more than the same exact ones from ebay. They also don't have the yellowish ring like the picture. The ring that holds the bearings are plastic upon opening the dust shield, exactly like the ones from ebay. You can get cheaper ones on amazon Mini Skater Skateboard Bearing 7x8x22mm ABEC 9 Precision 608 ZZ Scooter Longborad Bearings (16 Pcs Blue Silvery), you get more of them for less, and the ring that holds the bearings is metal. The rubber shield on them makes them easier to clean too. Would not buy again.	-1
I've ordered these twice. The first time was great, I received full stainless steel VXB branded bearings that spin for 45 seconds + in fidget spinners. The 2nd time I ordered these the bearing cages were plastic and the bearings were branded "Warp Speed" and they sucked! They can barely spin for 15 seconds, completely different product than the legit VXB bearings I originally received.	-1
Very poor quality. I bought these to use for 3D printed spinners. They do not spin as freely as they should, they are very stiff. I've used bearings that will spin for over a minute very easily but these are just cheaply made junk. I guess you get what you pay for.  EDIT: A few days later and these are even worse than they were before. The one bearing feels like it's grinding when spinning. Another one of the bearings is making noises when spun. Like I said, you get what you pay for and I got crappy bearings.	-1
These VXB 608ZZ shielded bearings are actually kinda expensive considering that they're not as smooth as the bearings I got from BC precision for 60 cents a bearing. These things are super gritty and have quite a bit of play. Bought once in December of 2015 and again October 2016. The shielding has changed from a chrome-like metal to a harder steel-like material. Still not smooth. Will not buy again.	-1
Not very well designed. The seals in the bearing kept falling out during installation.	-1
Did NOT come with 10 bearings. Only one came.	-1
Not the best bearings for a fidget spinner, spin time kind of sucks, and all the bearings feel like there's some kind of grit in them.	-1
Way better than VXB brand	-1
DO NOT BUY!!  I had hoped to use this "tourniquet" in my car & "grab & go" first aid kit.  It is unfit except for most basic home use.  It is truly a "Quick Release" though!  Unless it is exactly positioned correctly it releases on its own!!!  Plastic locking mechanism is flimsy and of very poorly engineered, cheap lightweight, plastic.  I would not trust it to hold unattended and unobserved for 30 seconds!!  It also locks, if you can call it that in a manner that creates "pinching" pressure point under the locking mechanism.  The elastic strap is also of very weak material.  As a former Navy corpsman and Marine Corps field corpsman, I do not believe this so called tourniquet would be effective for any but hand or food arterial bleeds.  It is NOT to be trusted stop or significantly decrease any arterial bleed of arm or leg.  It is best described as a quick release constriction band of poor quality and questionable engineering.  AVOID!	-1

um, why did they take away the food grade labeling on my packaging and replace it with a california cancer warning. n o t c o o l . what the heck is up? i wanted to water my herb garden with this. literally, my basil and mint and chives and in small smart pots that have limited medium.	-1

Absolute junk, I have no idea why this product is so highly reviewed. I'd suggest these might be only good for plastic or extremely thin wall tubing.  When they arrived, I immediately noticed they didn't appear very sharp.  One of the bits worked for enlarging 2 or 3 holes in low-grade, rusty, mild steel tubing (a boat trailer.) The rest of the bits wouldn't even make a dent: Even going slow with lots of oil and a large starting size, most of the bits wouldn't even start cutting! I also tried going fast, and tried different sizes. All but one bit was entirely worthless. The one bit that did work, only enlarged 3 holes before it stopped working.  For comparison, I have a single step drill bit from the big-red-brand sold at the big-orange-store that I have used for years drilling exactly this same kind of material. I felt it was getting a little slow, so I decided to try these. In the end, I wound up going back to my old, heavily used step bit that was not really that much more expensive, and it worked far better than any of these bits.  I'll be throwing these away.	-1
The size markings on the bits are laser etched so poorly you can't read what size the increments are.  Being unable to determine what size hole you are drilling, makes the bits very unusable.  The case is also cheaply made.  I wanted to like these bits but the QC is awful.	-1
Not sure who writes the sales pitches, but it would have saved us some hassle if they just said they do no fit the Gen. 4.	-1
I guess I did not read the whole thing. I wanted glass not plastic.	-1

Well made, solid, my opinion?  They could have charged like $30 for the thing and I would have still bought it.  Really nice set up for an AR15.  An additional nice feature is the end cap has its own on / off button for continuious use, unlike others I have bought.  That's a really nice feature.  Update: Well, everything I still said applies, but there is something that's frustrating me. The contact points, other words the pressure points u touch to turn it on and off, runs the full length of the strip. There should have been a dead area at the bottom so that you could use a tie wrap or something and attach it. Why?  Because I haven't had ANY luck finding ANY kind of a double stick tape that will hold this thing!!!  In fact, I'm not sure if there is any good way to attach it without a tie wrap strap. And no matter how low you put it, it will make it come on.  In short, I just don't know a way to do it so I have basically given up and am holding it with one strap at the top and letting the bottom flap all over the place.  The rubbery material is so slimy and slippery that nothing sticks to it. I have wiped it down with alcohol many times but it just doesn't stick. To make it worse, it's not completely flat at the bottom, it's more like a "T" (horizontally) so the lower end part is raised a little bit which makes it IMPOSSIBLE to mount this thing flat???  I finally gave up and used EPOXY to hold it, cuz they didn't give any real thought as to how to mount this thing because it should be completely flat on the bottom and designed to take some kind of a sticky!  Very upset because I bought 3 of them and no matter what weapon I try to attach it to, it's impossible unless you use a tie wrap which means it stays on all the time	-1
I had a 6 year old Hanna Ph/temp meter that I loved but it took 3 minutes to get an accurate ph reading, and it finally died. When I first received this, it worked just fine. It's been 2 days now, and the readings were way way low, so I got out the instructions and followed them to a tee. I pulled the strip out, cut it off and re-calibrated. It worked once, I added some ph up to my reservoir, went to test the ph, and it was all off again. I had to pull out the strip, cut it off again and recalibrate. I refuse to recalibrate every time I test. This meter is a piece of crap!	-1
This stuff really sticks, especially to your fingers and itself. As for anything else: maybe-maybe not. The most frustrating thing about this brand is that it doesn't tear clean and always leaves a stringer that peals back on the roll. This is pretty much for the know-nothings that heard a name so they get this. You are far better off with something like 3M of some other generic at the hardware stores. This junk is just not worth the frustration!	-1
I use double sided temporary tape for woodworking and lumber flatting applications. For my need a tape should hold a piece of lumber in place on a flat surface when applying moderate pressure to the opposite side with either a hand or power plane. It fails at this task. It's not very strong and inferior to the temporary tape sold by Home Depot or Lowes.	-1
Not thick or adhesive as other Duck branded products.	-1
Did not work very well on my tile	-1

I kept seeing plant/ fungus like structures in my specimens. Really believed I am seeing unique biological lives then on control I saw them too! So I started looking at slides.

I open the box and find a warranty card that says, among other things, "Blown right side gauge is not a warranted item and does not effect Performance (sic) of unit -- read and follow installation instructions (all of this is highlighted in yellow; the latter part about following instructions is underlined for emphasis.  I have no clue what that means. There are no instructions in the box. The company has a six-month warranty except on a certain part--which part exactly, I'm not clear on.  Any company that says they will only warranty part of the product, which comes as a single unit, and says part of it is "blown" is either just stupid or disreputable.  I'm going to send this one back. I just don't trust it or the company.	-1
way too dry to use, won't stick to wall just balls up, may be a bad batch I got because I believe I've used this brand before and it was good, but this one is far too dry to work with at all, it's similar to play doh.	-1

I bought this to look around in hard-to-reach dark places, and the narrow-beam nature of the light makes using it this way VERY tedious, at best.  Every time I need to look at something that requires a viewing angle that varies by more than a few degrees I have to pull the mirror out and (hopefully) adjust the light to a new angle that works.  At least the light is adjustable, but it doesn't help much.  Building my own model with a suitable light will waste far less of my time than using this item will waste in its use.  Someone else mentioned this in their review but I sadly ignored their observation due to the overwhelming love for this product from other reviewers .  I guess most of the other users are not relying much on the light feature.  I must say that even though this piece was made in China it seems to be built reasonably well.  (I don't hate China at all, though you might get that impression from my reviews - I am just fed up with all the garbage they seem to be selling stupid American's in record quantities.)	-1

Not a fan of these clips. I was really hoping it would work, but I actually found it hazardous! The loop that is created gets caught on things and actually almost made me trip in a patient room.

Not well made, harder to insert limbs and most frustrating is the head keeps slipping out. Get the black one from the other company appx same price. Had one that lasted for 4 yrs.

I bought this because I had seen the company's larger version in use at various events. I didn't need the capacity of the larger version, so I got this one. Profoundly disappointed. This is a toy, not an appliance. The first few times I used it, I thought I was doing something wrong. No, it's not me. This thing doesn't pop popcorn well. Using Great Northern Popcorn kernels and oil, following the directions exactly, I typically get 59 to 68 un-popped kernels per batch. Remember, this is a VERY small batch. I can put the exact same popcorn kernels and the same oil in an ordinary saucepan on my kitchen stove, with a vented lid, and get 5 to 7 un-popped kernels. Further, the lid (actually two lids) on the basket hang up near the hinge edge and won't let the popcorn out. I tried making small bends in the corners of the lids to see if that would help. It didn't. I would not recommend this toy to anyone. I plan to give mine away (with a warning to the recipient that it's a toy, not an appliance.)	-1

(Video Size and Quality was reduced to meet Amazons limits, Watch the full video on my YouTube GadgetClass channel)  The Carrera Precision comes in a few different varieties, all of which are just slight styling changes. There is a Titanium a Platinum, TF etc. They all use the same heavy cast metal body(not made of titanium or platinum) and stainless steel caliper parts. The metal case actually throws the balance off quite a bit. The build quality and accuracy is not all that great compared to the iGaging EZCAL. There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which renders all internal measurements inaccurate.  Summary: I would stay away from the Carrera and get the iGaging EZCal for the same exact price. The iGaging EXCal was the clear winner in this price category <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iGaging-IP54-Electronic-Digital-Caliper-0-6-Display-Inch-Metric-Fractions-Stainless-Steel-Body/dp/B001AQEZ2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iGaging IP54 Electronic Digital Caliper 0-6" Display Inch/Metric/Fractions Stainless Steel Body</a>  Cons: ~ There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which makes all internal measurements inaccurate. Watch my Youtube video showing this gap visually. ~ It just barely meets it's rated accuracy spec across the entire data set. ~ There is a lot of "Slop" between the ruling body and measuring body of the caliper which leads to a wide variation in measurement accuracy as you get closer to the ends of the jaws ~ Finish and build quality are lacking when compared side be side to the iGaging EZCal  Pros: ~ Fractional measurement (also present on the iGaging EZCAL) ~ Auto Off (Also present on the iGaging EXCAL)  Watch the full video series to make an informed buying decision.

These junk screws are only for sissy work in soft wood, as they strip quick under any load in metal or harder wood. Very poor value for the money. Seems you have to buy from top cabinet shop suppliers to get good screws now, as even a stainless steel set I recently bought at Home Depot won't magnetize(low steel content)and strips easily. Cheap Chinese junk all.	-1

I didn't buy this from Amazon, and I wish that I had because I would have seen these reviews.  After using this product for about 2 weeks, I noticed my teeth were getting brown stains. The only thing that I have done differently from normal is to use Crest Pro Health.  Now a week later, after only 2 weeks of use, my teeth still have brown stains on them. I'm hoping that they come out with extended sonicaire brushing focussing on those spots. If that doesn't work I really hope my dentist will get them out. Horrible product!	-1

This is advertised as having a 5/8" inside diameter.  It is actually too small to fit my JET tool rests.  I was able to use it on two aftermarket tool rests though.  If you are using JET products, beware.	-1
Maybe this would work if you're carrying around a long, tall cardboard box filled with styrofoam, but we were carrying something 2.5'x3'x2.5' weighing only 100 lbs., and the idea of using our elbows was a joke. It was totally awkward, the item was precariously balanced, and so we couldn't use these ridiculous straps.	-1
ended up not really using them	-1
Most did not work.  Ended up vacum sealing the bags I had them in.  Save your money	-1
We had ordered these while I was visiting my brother, they worked fairly well and I liked them so I ordered a set for myself. What I received was NOT the same as my brother received. He received three inch wide heavy duty straps, while the set I was sent was  about one and a half inch wide straps and NOWHERE as sturdy as the set he was sent. I immediately returned them and noticed that REPLACMENT was NOT an option. I also noted that there are several sellers for this item that also qualify for Prime. The pricing is very close, so who knows who is selling what ??????? My  Prime purchase was from a seller named Beautiful Time.  7/31 UPDATE - I re-ordered these with Amazon as the seller, they won't be delivered until end of August despite being a Prime item, but I am not in any hurry. I plan on keeping them in the car in case I may need them. For home use I have the original Shoulder Dolly. I will update again after I receive this new order.  08/09/13 - UPDATE - I was notified that the second order for these were actually going to be shipped much sooner than anticipated. I just opened the box from my second order of these straps, and this time the seller was supposedly Amazon. I received the cheaper ones again. These straps are only 1.5 inches wide, not the 3 inch wide ones we first received. Amazon needs to update their description of these straps, or otherwise get the correct ones in stock. Since I only wanted these as spares to keep in my car trunk, I am going to keep them - but I am definitely very disappointed.	-1
Just like others, I bought these without reading the reviews. How could a nylon strap be junk, right? Well it is possible! These are too short and thin to be useful. I tried to move a dresser and this lifts it just high enough to sit on your thigh so you get to make short choppy steps the whole way. They also don't provide a lot of vertical support so the dresser felt like it was going to tip the whole time. I too received 2" straps like other reviewers. I wouldn't recommend these at all. Buy lunch for an extra person to help you move instead.	-1

Very poorly built.  We had 15 pounds of material (I weighed the contents when I first saw issues with this product) in this cart and from the 2-3rd use we noticed small things being cracked or broken.  Now, after roughly 45 days (40-50 for sure) the lid is cracked or broken in 11 places and the cart itself  is barely holding together.  For us, a waste of $36.,.	-1
I bought this at a local hardware store, not on Amazon but since everyone uses Amazon for reviewing a product before they buy I thought I would put my comments here.  SO NOT WORTH IT !!  Just buy the good brand of Duct Tape, works better.  This tape barely stuck to my lap top to hold a piece down.  There is no way it would hold against Bricks like the commercial shows. I paid good money for this thinking it was very strong, but I was very very wrong ! Shoot, even the cheaper silver duct tape you can buy at kmart sticks better .... leaves residue behind, but still holds !	-1
This is not a stick-on Velcro.  As the title reads, sew-on Velcro.  I bought a lot---my bad---  I will Ty to return..	-1
way, way to small for anything. would not buy again.	-1
Bag came open and they were scattered in the box.  Also not as thick as they should of been imo.	-1
Kit has few larger grommets and a ton of tiny grommets. Diameter measurements are for the size hole you are inserting the grommet into, not the inside diameter of the grommet. Not what I was expecting.	-1
These are brittle and smell like poison....cheap Chinese pseudo rubber.	-1
Says "All RUBBER construction", but they appear to be harder, stiff, difficult to use VINYL. I can't find a link to contact the seller to resolve it w/ them before leaving feedback. I'm seeking a refund. Comparing a simple rubber band with these grommets, both pressed against hit meta woodstove - grommet immediately MELTS; rubber band unphased.  At best these are 'synthetic rubber' from crude oil, vs. natural, real rubber from rubber tree/latex. Anyone have a good link/source for rubber grommets? I'd give them a higher rating for super price if description said 'hard rubber', synthetic rubber or vinyl", but these aren't like normal rubber grommets I'm used to, and might not form a air/water-tight seal for canning / fermenting airlocks or other applications.	-1
Supposedly all-rubber.  Material is hard and not very flexible.	-1
To hard and not very flexible at all.	-1
Very hard material and not so easy to work with.  The material they're made of feels about as hard and brittle as the ones they are replacing.	-1
Thought first one was defective, sent it back. Second one does the same, just noise. Trying to check with the company at present time	-1
The aluminum components are too flimsy. I cracked one screwing it onto a hose end. The steel parts are just fine, it's the cheap aluminum that just doesn't hold up.  Going to look for quality brass or solid steel replacements.	-1
Save your money!!! Feels like I could crush the male ends of the quick connect and the couplers feel like they hardly even make a connection. Complete junk.	-1
Says it "comes with right to know labels", which is a big part of why I bought it.  It only comes with a single small label sheet that only has enough stickers for one bottle.  The rest would have to be marked with pen and tape.  This wasn't advertised clearly, and as much as I hate to do it, these are going back to Amazon.	-1
I bought the earlier version of this vacuum.  At first I loved it, but soon learned to hate it.  The one huge failing of this vacuum is a single filter that clogs with particulate matter such as cement dust off a garage floor.  It can happen in as little as vacuuming the garage once.  The filter is located inside the top of the collection bucket and it's spring loaded.  Removing it from the dusty bucket area results in fine dust getting shot everywhere when the spring pops back open.  Touching any part of the collection area makes any caught dust fall out onto the floor since you have now removed the bucket.  After you clean the filter, you have a giant mess of fine dust to vacuum up, re-clogging the filter.  I had to resort to removing the entire vacuum off the wall each time the filter needed cleaning and taking it outside.  Imagine doing this for every 10-15 minutes of operation.  Replacing the filter with a new one doesn't help the situation any.  I considered removing the filter entirely and venting the vacuum outside, but that would subject the motor to all the dust, probably killing it.  After dealing with this aggravation for several years I finally found a decent wall mount vacuum that takes bags and bought a VacuMaid GV50PRO.  Twice the price and louder, but I don't have to clean a filter out every 10 minutes of use.  If you never vacuum floors, drywall dust or other finer particulates the vacuum is great, but as a general shop vac it sucks.	-1
Well, it's big and takes up a lot of space, like I'd expect a garage vacuum to. It's loud, like I'd expect a garage vacuum to be. It's kind of expensive, like I'd expect a garage vacuum to be. Beyond that, it's not too far off from a household Bissell that can be wall-mounted.  For the size and weight of this vacuum, I was really expecting something like a car wash vac, or at the very least, a lower-end ShopVac that could live on my wall. What I really got though, seems like it was designed to grab Cheerio's out of your child seat.  I'm sure this is really awesome if you have a pristine white garage that you mostly use as a staging area for loading your wheelbarrow, and the worst mess you're going to clean up is maybe a bit of potting soil falling on the floor, or an improperly sealed bottle of Miracle Gro tipped over.  You see... the vacuum really isn't that powerful. Can it grab the dust from my garage floor? Sure. Pick up some spilled oil? Mmmmmmmmm-maybe. Leaves? Bolts? Wood scraps? Not really.  If you're looking for something really light-duty that helps promote the illusion that you could not locate a proper hardware store, let alone buy a vacuum from one, the Bissell fits the bill pretty nicely without breaking the bank. Installation was easy, and it looks nice on the wall.	-1
Cheap but OK.	-1
The case and tweezers are not very well made.  Mine came cracked and all ready broken.  The weights are okay at best.  They look sloppily made, weight added to be bottom and not leveled off so they don't set securely on the weight pan.  The tab weights are hard to read and hard to pick up with the provided plastic tweezers.  Because of the holidays I didn't get it sent back in time so I'm stuck with it.  I would suggest finding something different.  Don't waste your time or money on this set.  I found the set in the pictures at an antique shop near me.  It is from the early 1960's and works extremely well.	-1
Good price for this set.  Will find better way to store small weights. Update: you have to be kidding, you cant even make a 50 gram weight right. There was a piece of metal and two metal balls in the bottom of the container...turns out my 50 gramer decided to take a dump and is now in the high 48 to low 49 g range.	-1
The good news: The weights are reasonably accurate. I guess that's the important issue. Luckily, I don't need laboratory accuracy here.  I'm just using these weights to calibrate a cheap scale for weighing hops.  The bad news: 1. The plastic case is flimsy (the hinge was broken, so now the top just sort of lays on top).  Even if the lid was still attached, it would be rather useless, as the foam liner is too thin to hold the weights in place.  I could hear those weights rattling around loose inside when I received the package. 2. The weights have poor plating that is starting to peel off, which means those weights won't be accurate for very long. 3. And the plastic tweezers are almost comical in their uselessness.  Using those to attempt to grasp a weight is like trying to hold onto marbles while wearing mittens.  I give the whole mess 2 stars out of sheer generosity, due to the aforementioned accuracy of the weights.	-1
Won't lay flat. Wavy edges. Very unhappy tripping on them. Bought 2 large sizes and both have wavy edges. So highly rated make me think they are  defective.	-1
Jacked up the van just fine, when I was finished I went to lower the jack and it wouldn't go back down, had to get my jack to raise the van to get this one out. If it doesn't go down when released it's just an overpriced jack stand.	-1
Good for the price. Welds are not neat. looks like it was welded by an amateur. well, there is no parts diagram. just an explanation what to do. figure out yourself what is what and where. there appears to be plastic cap on its rear side and i have no clue what its function is. The valve is metal and in front and that i know. the hydraulics was not smooth.  Update: Just after one use, kept in storage. today I noticed that all the hydraulic fluid leaked out on its on! the screw was tight and the o-ring was in its place. I guess it was a leak from somewhere else. therefore, I am slashing it to 0 stars (if i could). waste of money. Pics attached. Now I am out of return window. thumbs down to amazon for selling this low quality product.	-1
After only a month, they began to crack and fall apart. I am using them in my commercial kitchen so they get washed daily. They haven't stood up to the usage that I expected. Next time, I'll spend the money to get quality mats.	-1
More garbage steel to go with a dresser that is also garbage.  Not worth the stamp to get them to your door.	-1
I bought this wheel for grinding an old concrete floor.  I worked very, very well for about 10 sqft.  After that, the wheel would no long cut, it would only polish the floor.  I switched back to the original Bosch DC510 wheel that was nearly worn out and I was able to finish the remaining section of floor.  The Bosch wheel is very expensive, but I was able to use 100% of the teeth.  By the way, despite what other reviewers say, this wheel does fit the Bosch 1773AK grinder.  The Bosch 1773AK grinder has a 5/8-11 threaded shaft and the locknuts that come with it will also accept a 7/8" no thread wheel (like the Bosch DC-510).  Many of the other 5/8-11 grinding cups will not fit this grinder as they are tool tall for the grinder shroud.	-1
I must have got a bad batch, won't dry quickly or hold worth a darn.	-1
- The product works as expected, glued 3D printed plastic parts without a mess and very reliable - The amount of glue in the rather large "container" is a joke, it is as if there is enough for 3-4 times usage on smaller parts and the bottle is empty! - You pay 4-5 times more than for similar/identically working competitor's products - Deceptive packaging - large bottle with almost no content	-1
These kinds of products never seem to work for me!!	-1
I bought this based upon what some users claimed it did not dry out. I had never seen a super glue that once opened did not dry out, so I thought let's see. Well I found out; any super glue once opened dries out. The air in the bottle, even the small amount introduced upon opening that stays in the bottle after closing is enough to start drying process. So now I know why they sell single use tubes; it's the only way to go unless you need a large amount all at one time. Wrote this for others so they don't have to repeat my experiment.	-1
The dispenser does not work.  I have more on my hands than came out of the tip.  Don't they test their products anymore?  This was a waste of money... no matter how cheap.	-1
I got to use this one time and it dried up into itself after that first use. I had placed the cap onto the bottle completely and totally yet it still dried up like a raisin. If I had known that I was only getting one use - I would have purchased single use tubes - as a matter of fact - it seems that so often tubes of super glue DO DRY UP so fast that buying singles may be the perfect answer!	-1
It's ok for snares, but the Stainless Steel wire works far better, less lost snares, less failures. Stainless will hold a hog, this will not.	-1
Most of them died in 2 months.	-1
Chemical Guys sprayers are the WORST.  The stems are too long for the 16oz sprayer so they pinch and fold over in the bottom of the bottle.  After a few refills the stem breaks at the crease and no longer reaches the bottom of the bottle.  After contacting Chemical Guys I was told that what I'd witnessed "doesn't happen" and was told that their bottles "worked perfectly fine".  Pitiful product and worse "customer service". If you do get stuck with this bottle, you can order 6mm OD x 4mm ID Polyethylene flexible tubing, and you can cut a correct dip tube length.	-1
Thick plastic, very commercial quality feeling, spayed everything I put in them....everything!  But they F'ing leak......every single of of them. Thanks bottles, you fooled me with your awesomeness and then you went behind my back and leaked everything inside you all over my car. I even bought 6 of you and 5 out of 6 of you leaked everything. Have you no soul? What did I ever do to deserve this? Bottom line is if you like really nice bottles that leak, buy these	-1
I thought these babies were chemical resistant! They are not. The spray mechanism no longer functions after a few weeks with alloy wheel spray. Worked good for a month though.	-1
Great concept just poor implementation.  No good way to keep the box together so its constantly falling apart without using tape.	-1
a lot thin	-1
The bags are just a little to light weight for what I put in them.  Maybe if your going to put pills or something they might have been fine.  I now looking for bags that are more beefy - maybe 4,5, or 6 mill.  Using them for putting Geocaching stuff in.	-1
Received the wrong item. Got 2 Mil instead of 4 Mil thick zip lock bags.  Returning them for refund.	-1
Difficult to open and close,  The closure strip is very thin and fragile.  Not good for bagging small parts repetitively,because they don't easily open with one hand as a zip lock should by sliding finger and thumb in opposite directions.	-1
These are not soft like the WipeAll 20s I'm used to.  They are much tougher (semi cloth like) but very scratchy surface and they do not absorb water anywhere near as quickly as the WipeAll 20s.	-1
The new Brand III formulation has only 58% ethanol. This is under the 60% minimum recommended for hand sanitizers, so I wouldn't trust it in a surface disinfectant, either.	-1

junk. they basically fall apart while cutting. where full body protection cause pieces go everywhere	-1
Don't be like me and try to save money, just buy the spray can. This leaves white spots on a white shirt.. yeah its that bad.	-1
I am sure they are ok but not what I thought. I was just wanting the blades not a hole scalpels.  I need to return them.	-1
this is a total wast of 20 $ don't go here. the griping arms bend very easy. do not grip anything after a day or two of use. it takes a few  tries to pick up 16 oz. Pepsi bottle. you need to squeeze the the handle with both hands. then try & try again. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK.	-1
Terrible. Buy another brand!	-1
Do not buy this. 26yr machinist and the cheapest test dial ind is better then this one	-1
breaks easily	-1
The first one was off .001, the second was spot on but the crystal was cracked, the third was off .0015. Signed an experienced machinist!	-1
it would not work right out of the package had to return it	-1
I'm a Dewalt guy, but this is overpriced, the tip is HUGE!!!!! Go on ebay and get a china verson for cheaper please.	-1
I saw mixed reviews, but I saw it had the features I wanted and it was a DeWalt which one thinks "quality" so I got it. Money down the toilet.  #1. The camera doesn't show you which way is up, so its difficult to position the head so that the camera is giving you a good angle.  #2. The removable screed MIGHT broadcast 1 1/2ft before the pic quality is so bad you cannot move it further. For any practical purpose, the monitor cannot be moved more than 1ft away. Even after following instructions to make sure that the monitor battery was fully charged.  #3. as even at 1ft the image is crappy, the video/pic also comes out crappy, because it records on the monitor, not the body, so you can scratch good images with the monitor off.  as if that wasn't enough, I used this tool FOUR times, and the battery died COMPLETELY. I mean charge, and its dead in 5 min.  This thing made me sick to deal with, use, and pay for. Alternate? cant say I've seen one that has these features, which is what anyone using this for more than an odd job needs. But though theoretically this should be able to do, it lacks the overall quality and ergonomics.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Purchased this to look into crawl spaces where the overhead clearance is too low for a person. The specs said you could see much further than actual. I couldn't see 3 feet with any clarity so I sent my purchase back as an unacceptable product. If you need to look at something that is right in front of the camera then it's probably ok.	-1
returned it....couldn't get a level mount	-1
I was able to purchase these large bottles of epoxy at a reasonable price. And so I thought I was getting a bargain.  I soon found out that this product does not work very well. I have used it to try to repair various items and I always end up being frustrated because it does not create a strong bond. No matter what I have tried to repair, the bond will eventually break again. Sometimes the glue never seems to cure. It remains gooey. EXTREMELY frustrating because you have to remove the uncured glue and it creates a major mess.  And yes, I always mix it properly.  Loctite does make some good products.  But, none of their epoxy glues have worked well for me.	-1
worthless - first time I open it and the resin bottle has turned to a white thick paste.  does not mix well with hardener and does not harden - at all.  If you NEED an actual epoxy that hardens NTM binds to materials, this is NOT it.  You've been warned	-1
Works great the first time use but drys out in a short time.	-1
The holes are too small for most standard (flat) screwdriver heads that I have. I was only able to put small screwdrivers in this. However, I was able to use a larger drill bit and drill the holes larger to accommodate my commonly used screwdrivers, but the handles don't fit well into the small cubby hole intended for them. This would be perfect for small, commonly used screwdrivers, but not for average-sized or larger screwdrivers.	-1
It's a lot smaller than it looks. Real working screwdrivers will not fit into the dedicate spaces. Good screwdrivers generally have handles about 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Kiddie sets might be smaller, but if you want your tools at the ready to grab and use then you do not use kiddie screwdrivers.	-1
Rattles when turned. Wanted to return it, but decided that it would not be worth the efford and threw it away.	-1
I've used several different carpet cleaners over the years, some I've rented, some I've purchased. After renting a carpet cleaner a few times it became obvious that for only a bit more than a rental, I could own a cleaner rather than have to rent one that has to be returned quickly. That's when I invested in my first Hoover carpet cleaner. I bought it used and I don't remember the model number. Although used, the carpet cleaner worked extremely well and I was very pleased with it. There was only one problem with it - the previous owner had broken the upholstery wand and I really wanted to be able to do my upholstery.  So I gave that used one to a friend and bought a brand new one from Amazon - the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hoover-SteamVac-Carpet-Cleaner-with-Clean-Surge-F5914-900/dp/B00009R66F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900</a>. This one was fantastic! Everything worked well on it, including the upholstery wand.  A bit later, I received a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BISSELL-Big-Green-Deep-Cleaning-Machine-Professional-Grade-Carpet-Cleaner-86T3/dp/B00450U6CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BISSELL Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine Professional Grade Carpet Cleaner, 86T3</a>&nbsp;to review. This cleaner was also fantastic, although not cut out for small living areas due to its bulky size. However, that same large size meant I could clean a larger area in a shorter period of time, which was very nice.  When I found the Hoover MaxExtract77 Multi-Surface Pro Carpet & Hard Floor Cleaner FH50240, I was sold. The one thing all of the other carpet cleaners I had were missing was a hard floor cleaning feature. I had purchased a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wagner-905-1-500-Watt-On-Demand-Power-Steamer-and-Cleaner/dp/B000I618NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wagner 905 1,500-Watt On-Demand Power Steamer and Cleaner</a>&nbsp;to steam my floors and it works very well, but I thought having one machine to do both hard floors and carpeted areas would be perfect.  Unfortunately, the MaxExtract77 doesn't live up to the quality I've previously experienced with the Hoover brand, both in carpet cleaners and vacuums. From the moment I started assembling this unit, I knew it was bad. I've assembled two carpet cleaners and three vacuums by myself over the years without a problem. The MaxExtract77 I received was very obviously defective. I screwed the top handle into the base without issue. Then I tried to add the water tanks. The bottom tank for dirty water fit fine. The top tank that holds the solution was a different story altogether. It was impossible to latch it into the cleaner and I almost hurt myself trying to. Impossible, that is, until I removed the screw securing the top handle in the base. With the screw removed, I could get the top tank to latch if I pushed it with a lot of weight behind it. The trouble is, this pushed the screw holes on the top handle and base out of alignment so the screw could no longer be inserted at all. Not good.  I finally gave up and called Hoover customer service, where I received an agent who introduced herself as Mona Lisa. This agent was not very helpful, didn't seem to know what to do or how to handle a situation like this and finally promised to have a supervisor call me to see if they could help better. That was April 24, 2012. It is now July 4, 2012 and I still have not received that return call. After waiting fruitlessly for that call, I finally called the customer service line again. This time I was aided by Ian, who was actually extremely professional and helpful. He agreed to send replacement parts for the top tank and the top handle in the hopes that these new parts might be made a bit better. Ian went out of his way to make this exchange as convenient as possible for me, even sending a shipping label so I could send the defective parts back.  The new parts arrived the next week. While they work a little better, they are still not good. I can now secure the handle with the screw AND put the top tank in, but again I have to push the top tank in with a lot of weight behind it to make it fit.  Although I had no confidence in this machine, I tried cleaning my carpets with it. One thing I do like is that the solution reservoir has separate compartments for clean water and the solution. This allows you to use a Rinse feature on the machine if you like.  The MaxExtract77 is close to the same size that my old Hoover was, but I found it much more difficult to push over the floors than the old one. In fact, my Bissell is much larger than the MaxExtract77 and the Bissell is easier to push. When I finished cleaning all the floors in my home and the upholstery in my car, my arm ached from the wrist all the way to the shoulder blade. I wasn't able to sleep on that side at all that night and the pain kept me awake until I finally put two ice packs on my arm. I've never had this issue with any other carpet cleaner.  Despite the issues with the assembly and the weight of the machine, it really did a great job on both the upholstery in my car and my carpet. I bought my car used and have never cleaned the upholstery before. Someone evidently spilled dark soft drinks in various locations because after I sprayed the seats with the Hoover cleaner, large dark spots appeared where there had previously been no sign of a stain, almost as if it were invisible ink. The Hoover worked very well to remove these old stains and also some newer stains on the carpet in my house.  I then set about to clean the hard floors in my home. This feature was the main reason I wanted the MaxExtract77 and I was excited to use it. The hard floor attachment was easy to attach to the bottom and it seemed secure when I started. I was soon disappointed when that hard floor attachment fell off the unit after 2 or 3 pushes and was further frustrated when it persisted in falling off constantly. Not only that, the hard floor cleaning didn't seem to actually suck up any water and left huge puddles of water all over the kitchen and dining room floors, causing me to fall or nearly fall several times. I called it quits when the last fall hurt my tailbone pretty badly and also bruised my arm significantly. There are much easier ways to clean a hard floor without resulting in bodily injury.  One other thing to note is that the Hoover MaxExtract77 seems to run through the cleaning solution pretty quickly. It came with a 32 fluid ounce bottle of the Hoover Professional Strength 2X Concentrate for carpets and a 16 fluid ounce bottle of the hard floor cleaning detergent. The carpet cleaning concentrate ran out before I finished and I had to get some more cleaner to finish the carpets. Before I ran out, I was able to clean the upholstery in my car, the living room, two bedrooms and the hallway. I used the entire bottle of hard floor detergent to try to clean the kitchen and dining room floors. There might have been enough left in the clean water tank to do the two bathrooms since they are very small, but I gave up on hard floor cleaning before I made it to those rooms.  If the MaxExtract77 had been the first Hoover device I had ever used, I would likely never buy another of their products again. Luckily, I have had fantastic experiences with other Hoover products in the past. I do like the Hoover brand, but I would absolutely never recommend the MaxExtract77 floor cleaner to anyone. This machine is highly defective and should be scrapped. Look at other Hoover models, but do not buy this one.	-1
The Hoover MaxExtract77 Multi-Surface Pro Carpet & Hard Floor Cleaner is advertised to clean both carpets and hard floors, including sealed hardwood floors.  In the past we've used a Bissell carpet cleaning machine which has worked well on rugs & carpets, but having been unable to find a good hardwood floor cleaner we have always had to clean our hardwood floors manually.  Since our home has a lot of hardwood flooring with some rugs & carpets my wife and I were very hopeful this model would meet our needs with one machine.  The cleaner arrives packaged in a huge box.  The contents were neatly packed, and nothing arrived broken or missing.  Assembly was simple with only a Phillips head screwdriver needed to attach the handle.  The instructions included with the cleaner are poorly written and illustrated, but we were able to figure out how to use the machine with little difficulty.  The Hoover web site, to their credit, has some very clear-cut videos that show exactly how to assemble and use the cleaner.  I recommend viewing those before trying to operate the cleaner since the printed instructions are so poor.  As advertised, the cleaner has separate tanks for clean and dirty water.  My wife found it difficult to snap the tank with clean water into place, but the dirty water tank is easy to install and remove.  The cleaner comes with sample cleaning solutions for both carpets and hardwood floors (different solution is used for each).  First off, this machine is very loud -- much louder than most vacuums and so loud that hearing protection would be advised during usage.  It is also quite heavy and cumbersome to move around on carpeting.  My wife had a fair amount of difficulty moving it in directions other than straight forward and back.  It cleans rugs and carpeting well, and the suction left no moisture under our rugs.  My wife felt it may have cleaned rugs slightly better than our Bissell unit did, but she found this Hoover cleaner to be much more difficult to push around on rugs.  We were greatly disappointed in the cleaner's ability to clean our hardwood floors.  While it did fine from a cleaning standpoint, the cleaner did a very poor job of extracting liquid off the floor despite using the included squeegee attachment.  It left a large amount of liquid on the flooring and seemed to do little more than push it around the floor when it was supposed to be sucking it back up.  Even worse, it seemed to deposit more liquid on the floor while we were trying to dry it.  It ended up generating extra work as we had to mop the floor afterward.  In the end my wife felt it involved less work to clean our hardwood floors manually than it does with this Hoover cleaner.  Bottom line:  if you have predominantly rugs & carpeting you will probably be happy with this Hoover floor cleaner as it really does clean those areas well.  But you could also probably find another rug & carpet floor cleaner that does just as well for less.  I cannot recommend this floor cleaner for hardwood floors.  We do not have tile floors in our home, so I cannot fairly comment about how it would work on tile surfaces.  But as poorly as this unit performed with extracting liquid off our hardwood flooring I would not expect it to work any better on tile.  So our search goes on for a good hardwood floor cleaner.  This Hoover is not the machine for that job.	-1
Update: The product listing on Amazon has been updated since I originally posted this review. The new product listing has, fortunately, removed the prior inaccurate information about this device being for use with checking salinity in addition to temperature and TDS, etc. In the old listing, it was marketed as a TDS device that could also check salinity in and of itself and on various salinity scales. My original review is below in case the product listing changes again.  *** Original review: ***  I do not recommend this unit if you plan to use it to check salinity in a salt water tank. The product page here on Amazon lists that it is for checking salinity in addition to TDS, temperature, etc. If it doesn't do that (and it doesn't), it should say that.  I purchased one of these to use for my reef aquarium. The product insert says it can be used for reef aquariums and provides instructions for that purpose (two suggested scales). The outside of the box also says that it is for aquarium and aquaculture use. However, my unit was not able to read salinity on either recommended scale; the device simply stated the parameters were out of range and displayed no reading. I tested my water with another salinity-measuring device and also calculated the salinity by hand, and the water was within standard reef parameters according to both calculations. However, the HM Digital I received could not read within that range.  I tested the device in other solutions as well with varying levels of salt and it was able to pick up a reading for lower levels of salinity. However, it could not pick up a reading for salinity in a standard salt water tank range even when the salt water was not mixed in with the tank (and thus had not been dosed with anything). The HM Digital did, however, consistently read temperature in all samples I tested.  Otherwise, the device was easy to use. It is easy to switch modes and was great for reading temperature; but it's a rather expensive for just temperature use.  There might be a simple explanation for this, or I might have received a bad unit, but when I contacted the company, they ignored my email. I am returning the item through the seller, who has been helpful. I wanted to love this item, but unfortunately, I recommend that you just buy a hydrometer or an actual refractometer for salt water use.	-1
I turned the locking lever to lock the measurement in place and the lever broke off.  I didn't use much force.  The screw on the lever screws into a thin brass tube and the tube had cracked all the way around its circumference.  Other than the lever the tool feels of good quality.  The thimble turns freely but with enough friction that your measurement doesn't shift, and nothing feels loose.  The smaller silver thimble sticks out of the end of the larger thimble has a ratchet such that as you tighten it down on what you're measuring, it will start clicking instead of turning, at which point you can take your measurement.  The gauge didn't quite read 0 when I ratcheted it closed all the way, but it did return to the same not-quite-0 point when opened all the way and closed again.  When opened to 1 inch my ruler said it was maybe 0.5 to 1mm larger than an inch, so it's not extraordinarily accurate at larger distances.  A small tool is included which can be used to change the 0 point.  The problem is that small tools are easy to lose, and it's got such a specialized shape I don't know how you could ever adjust the zero point if you lost it.  The manual say the little black plastic oval on the blue horseshoe is a "heat insulating plate".  I guess you're supposed to hold it there when reading hot things, or maybe when reading anything so the temperature of your body doesn't affect it?  The manual doesn't say, but the plastic is too small for me to hold it there without touching the metal, and I have fairly-small fingers.  The gauge reads in decimal inches with 0.001 inch markings and one full turn of the thimble equals 0.025".  I find it hard to visualize what the measurements mean because I'm so used to dealing with inches as 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, etc.  If you're used to visualizing fractional inches as well as millimeters, you might want to get a millimeter micrometer instead.  The manual is actually written with an example of reading a millimeter-scale micrometer, which really confused me until I remembered this was an inch-scale micrometer.	-1

We had a leak in the main water lines to the house (1/2 inch). The leak was at a straight connector on the pipe. The tape was put on, then covered with a rubber sleeve and then clamps used to hold all in place. The pressure of the water cased the tape to bubble up and eventually let water through. We went though the process again and this time increased the thickness of the tape. While it held for a few minutes the tape would not hold enough to prevent the loss of water. IT may have worked on a  really low pressure water line however not on a main water line to my house. We still have most of the roll which we will use in the future for very small leaks and see if the tape will hold. We had to call a plumber which we intended to do so anyway as this tape was only temporary to get us through the week end.	-1
A light breeze could almost separate this from its self.  Not impressed at all.  Ended up throwing it in a draw and will probably never use it.	-1
No where near velcro, this tape is 35 percent weaker in holding power.  I overlooked I did not by the original product, and this is a weak substitute.  Cheapo.	-1
This is not a two piece velcro read product description	-1
Does not hold well at all. Hook and loops are to small to stick together.	-1
Cheap metallic rubber magnets.  You can literally crush them with a pair of pliers, or cut them in half with a box knife.  If you're making some lame arts & crafts thing that doesn't matter to anybody and will likely be discarded soon after making it, then these are the magnets you want.  That about sums it all up.	-1

It's as thin as water, so unless you need to apply this to a large area, it's almost impossible to keep the liquid where you need it. It also takes a long time to dry	-1
These SUCK! The first five, yes five, were duds and didn't Work! Terrible, terrible, terrible. Don't BUY these.	-1
This test is fairly easy to use and understand. You pee into a cup and dip the end of the strip in it for 10 seconds. After you wait 5 minutes you check the test. The line that tells you the test worked always showed up very dark. The line that tells you if your positive or negative is not.  I don't like that the line for positive or negative was either invisible or barely visible. I took the tests every week for months and could not see any difference in the positive or negative line. The first 6 weeks I saw nothing. After that I started to see a bit of red on the right side of the line. According to the test anything means you are negative, but this test is not very reassuring. This test should have a better and more visible reading.  If you have a test that will decide your employment or your freedom I would not trust this test. Not using for months is the only way that I know I am clean and this test did not help me at all. The main reason I bought this test was to have some idea of when I would be clean to find new employment. It told me nothing and I still had to wait it out and let time take it's course.  Overall I would consider this test a waste of money and if you need to pass a test the best thing to do is quit smoking.	-1
Really just plain garbage. Half of them say I pass half of them say I failed. Its been well over a month since I smoked and I was a casual smoker at the time. Don't waste your money.	-1
Are you on a budget?  Yes?  Then it'll work.  No? Get something else.  1.) Upon first inserting my optical audio cable, the receptacle pushed back into the housing and I had to tweezer it out. 2.) There's a constant hissing sound if the cable isn't attached JUST right, which means I had to tape everything down.  Not good.  Does it work?  So far.  It's only been a day, but I'm not impressed.	-1
I bought this because I wanted an easy solution to some issues of interfacing a new TV with a small stereo system.  This thing does what it is supposed to do, but the S/N ratio is terrible and the frequency response is equally bad.  I could go on and on, but the bottom line is that if you are looking for decent fidelity you should explore other options because this thing is noisy as hell.	-1
Worked well the first dozen times I used it. After showing an open on pins 1 & 2 and me cutting off the RJ45 three times, I tried it on a known good cable. Same reading. Closer inspection revealed the number 1 pin was bent over the #2 pin. Straitened it but still reads open. Replaced with Southwire model M400TP.	-1
Overpriced. Doesn't use standard batteries but button cells. About twice what it should cost. Klein should be ashamed.	-1
The bottles appear to be of adequate quality, the droppers are more cheaply made and apparently cannot be separated from the rubber bulb/cap for sterilization/cleaning.  That's a huge problem because the company does not put them together at the time of manufacturing so as to minimize contamination of either the inside of the bottles (tops are completely open from the time of packaging through arrival to the end user, and the droppers are loose and completely separate from the bottles, allowing for individual contamination of each dropper).  Therefore, these should all be considered contaminated upon arrival because of the manufacturing process, requiring complete cleaning/sterilization before use, depending on the intended use by the end user.  For homeopathic remedies, for example, this is entirely unacceptable.  This is not just a shipping issue, they are created this way by the manufacturer	-1
This lil thing is cute. I think I might put it in my dollhouse. Really, this duster is diminutive. I'm guessing it holds an ounce of powder or something. I was hoping for larger, since my garden space measures in 1000's of sq ft, not a kitchen window garden. It would have been nice if seller had listed product dimensions or given a photo of it next to a quarter for reference.	-1
Comes apart at low rpm	-1
These are not worth it.  Buy the Dremel brand in bulk; they offer better value.  These are really limp, I went through a pack of them in no time, even being gentle, running half speed as recommended.  The real Dremel brand ones did better, enough so to justify their increased cost, but I hope you don't need many of these little brushes like I did, as they will bankrupt you.  Good luck!	-1

I wasn't planning on writing a review of this product, but because of Amazon's insistant email requests, I'll do so, just so I can get on with my life.  This is in no way an attempt to discredit this product or the company supplying it.  It is only my opinion based on my experience using the paste they sent me.  I have used diamond paste for decades, from putting mirrored finishes on hardened tooled edges to bringing scratched, delicate watch crystals back to their original condition.  Diamond paste is the perfect medium for taking fine and not-so-fine scratches out of most any hard material.  I was attracted to TEMO because of the low price.  It's far less than the other supplier I've purchased my DP from in the past.  Especially after volume is considered.  This paste looks exactly like my more expensive brand, has the same consistency, but comes in a 5 gram tube, more than twice the size of that sold by my regular supplier.  Based on those criteria, it truly was a great deal.  To date, I've only found one drawback with TEMO's paste...  It appears to have no diamond in it.  I refer to mine as "Diamond Paste Placebo".  If you've never used diamond paste before and use TEMO's paste with a "wool polisher" as they recommend, you might be impressed with the results.  What you wouldn't know, is using a wool polisher by itself, will brighten things up... That's why they call them "Wool Polishers".&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Meguiar-s-Cut-N-Shine-8-Wool-Buffing-Pad/dp/B0002NYE3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Meguiar's Cut N' Shine 8" Wool Buffing Pad</a>.  At most, this "diamond paste placebo" or whatever you want to call it, might lubricate the wool, but will most likely ruin it by clogging it up and causing grit to embed itself into it.  If you're going to use a machine to polish with diamond, such as a Hira-To scissor sharpening device, a thin, metal-backed felt pad would probably be the closest thing to wool that you'd want to use.  I don't own such a machine, so I can't comment on TEMO's success with this type of pad... But I do know, it doesn't work with any other standard backing material, making the odds that it will work on felt, about zero.  With this paste, using it the way diamond paste should be used, properly; I wasn't able to remove the finest scratches on R120 durometer plastic, much less anything harder.  Rouge (on a buffing wheel) does a better job.  From now on I'll buy my diamond from my other supplier<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DMT-DPK-Dia-Paste-Diamond-Compound-Kit-of-1-3-and-6-Micron/dp/B000MF7JSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DMT DPK Dia-Paste Diamond Compound Kit of 1, 3, and 6 Micron</a>, thank you...  1 unpolished star from me...

I have an XL2 and these don't fit my oreck at all.	-1
I CANNOT FAIRLY RATE THESE BAGS. The machine I received was defective, so could never use these. I assume they are as good as my other Oreck bags for my small machine	-1
This is not worth the money. I was only able to use it 3'xs before it smelled up my house horribly!  Even changing the bag each time I vacuumed and adding the fresheners. I wish I had never purchased it!	-1
Knock-off of a knock-off.  Worked okay when first gotten, since has gone down hill.  It fluctuates voltage as amperage changes.  My circuit is set at 14.1V and if I enable the draw, the voltage rises to 14.9V as the amperage goes from 30mA to 100mA, it then drops back down to 14.1 as the amperage reduces.  It does this on both channels.  I have since bought the tekpower/kaito&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kaito-30V-5A-Triple-Output-DC-Power-Supply-HY3005D3/dp/B00069CN32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kaito 30V/5A Triple Output DC Power Supply, HY3005D3</a>.  It is completely different inside and seems to be built much better.  You can see what I'm talking about on this review page.  http://www.loneoceans.com/labs/tekpower/	-1
Sadly, the ones I received all had labels already on them and are nearly impossible to remove.  Additionally, they seem to always cross-thread though I have not had any trouble with them leaking.  (I use them to transport saltwater corals as it keeps them safe from being crushed in bags.)	-1
Not as strong a vac as I would like.  Compared to old Phantom, it has slightly more convenient attachments, but has about 75% of the suck.	-1
Excessive difficulty in assembling - some parts simply wouldn't snap together until near breakage point.  I had to go into "Zen mode" and become one with the vacuum cleaner before I could get it fully assembled.  Emptying the dirt cup and cleaning the filter was easy, however putting the dirt cup back onto the vacuum cleaner was a real pain in the you-know-what.  I tried my best to follow the directions which say to align it up and then press down.  I kept wrestling with it for at least 10 minutes and still it would NOT snap down.  Finally I hooked the back latch over the it's notch, and then using it as a hinge I was able to get the front snapped.  Voila.  (I'm writing this in as a note to myself in case I forget the trick to it).  However, once you get through the "parts" part, it does a good job of vacuuming. (See UPDATE at bottom of review) It has a very powerful motor.  With various selections for the type of carpet, including bare floor, I chose the one for short carpet and I could definitely feel a strong pull from the vacuum cleaner.  It also did a great job on the bare floor in the hallway.  Having no bags to buy is nice but the filter gets real dirty real fast.  I will probably remove the filter every time I empty the dirt cup and use the included brush to clean it with.  It says you can wash the filter but I haven't done that yet.  The hose attachment is nice and pliable and the suction is very good through it.  I used it to vacuum the stairs up to the second level of our home.  Since the cord on the vacuum cleaner is very long, I didn't have to unplug it to find a closer socket as I approached the top of the stairs.  It stayed plugged in the bottom electrical socket.  I had to bring the vacuum cleaner up with me as I went higher and higher up the stairs and it stayed well balanced on the step or two below the one I was vacuuming.  My other upright vacuum cleaners want to lean forward and fall down the steps.  This one stayed in place.  I don't know how long the motor will last.  My other two vacuums are at least 20 years old each and still running good but they don't suck as strongly as the Eureka.  It's a heavy vacuum so I will probably keep it downstairs and use the others for the upstairs.  Overall, it's good, but I sure didn't like the assembly or trying to place the dirt cup back on.  I hope that after more experience with it I will be able to snap it back on quickly.  I certainly hope so because it seems to fill up quickly.  It comes with lots of attachments to get to those cracks and crevices.  I will have to be sure and empty the dirt cup before attacking our sofas.  UPDATE:  11.5.12 ___________________ O.K. I've had this thing for a while now and I'm NOT nearly as impressed now with it as I was when I first wrote this review.  It no longer picks up trash from our short carpet (yes, it's at the correct height setting) and drops as much trash as it picks up.  I empty the dust cup frequently since it fills up so fast but now it's hardly picking up any carpet dirt.  One of our dogs chewed up a bathroom rug and there were 1 inch strings from the rug on our carpet.  It would not suck any of them up but instead they all got wadded together in a ball and the vacuum started bouncing.  Honestly, I can't recommend buying this thing.  I have lowered my original star rating from a 4 to a 2 star review.	-1
It's very small, difficult to read, it can't tell you within a degree F what the temperature is because the graduations are spaced two degrees apart.  Accuracy?  I don't know; can't tell.	-1
Broke after 6 months of regular use.  Bought another, hoping it will last but yup this one also broke.  I never dropped either or submerged them in water.  I've had other sonicares last years. Something with this model was cheaply made as many other reviewers brushes also failed.	-1
I have had this unit for 2 1/2 years.  It worked well for about 2 years.  The brush heads wear out within a month and are expensive.  The handle vibration energy is no longer being transferred to the brush head stub, but to the handle body itself.  As a result the handle vibrates like crazy and is very loud.  I had the "Original Sonicare" toothbrush for over 12 years.  It worked flawlessly.  Brush heads lasted six months.  The power button on the unit finally died.  This is the ONLY reason I bought the new unit.  Very disappointing.  Sonicare had a wonderful, original design and ruined it with bells & whistles and a cheaper concept.  However, the price went way up.	-1
Arrived damaged, ups can not deliver heavy items that are fragile.	-1
I'm sure it's working great but I can't get over the smell that's coming out. It's been 3 days since this filter was installed with a known good inline fan I have and I'm sure it's working great and airflow both in and out of the tent are spot on. The problem, and reason for the two stars is it smells like old stale hot dogs, or some kind of rancid meat, but with a hint of smoke or something. It's definitely coming from the filter and is the strongest when the tent door is open and it gets the best airflow. My entire apartment now smells of this weird spoiled meatish food smell, and I have to leave the windows open in the middle of winter just to get some fresh air, ironic. I'll give it a week but I'm afraid that's about it and then I'll be getting another filter and sadly it won't be a Phresh.	-1
This filter is not depicted as the one in the ad on Amazon. I thought it would come black and it came in a break silver mesh cylinder I should have read the ad a little bit more because it doesn't contain carbon of which iPhreshsays doesn't really do much. Also this is not a filter to remove odors I could have made this for about $5 with materials from a hardware store. I didn't even bother opening in it. This was a waste of my time and don't waste yours not.	-1
The finish work on the cap was more egg shaped than round and that crap about tight packing of the carbon is a lie...the ipower was a much better made filter.  I have to get this thing to work by this weekend as a gift from a friend's spouse to him, doubt that will happen,	-1
Well, it worked initially.  I calibrated it and stored it as stated and was able to use it a couple of times.  Waterproof it proved not to be.  During storage the storage solution leaked out and got on other items.  Granted, there is no rubber seal around that part, but in addition to simply leaking out the fluid apparently seeped into the internals of the unit itself.  After about 6 months the unit started acting intermittent and shortly after that it failed to turn on (it came on by itself at one point while I had it outside with me).  I replaced the batteries and it came on, acted intermittent, provided incorrect displays and then shut down; never to come on again.  I recheck the battery seating and found they were all slightly wet.  While attempting to clean out the dampness in the battery chamber one of the terminals (+) came out of the unit and I could see it had corroded off completely.  I even resoldered the contact back on carefully and cleaned the circuit board but still no power.  Into the trash it goes now and I won't be buying another of these units.	-1
this is my second filter ,the first one i had to send back as it did not work. the second filter has 4 weeks run time on it and it is failing to remove the smells, i would like to contact the seller .however amazon says item is not returnable any more due to time. well for 145.00 i would at least like some advice on the product .	-1
These are a piece of crap. Spend the money and buy the blue lab PH tester. I used to swear by these but they would go out at least once a year. Not only that they need to be calibrated much more often than the blue lab. If you use this, you should be calibrating at least once a week.	-1
Not worth it unless you are willing to swap them out every 3 months.  That's how long two of them lasted in my application.  55% humidity average.  I guess they are too effective when you get right down to it.  If I could dial down the effectiveness and get 6 months out of a filter, I would be OK with it.  Just can't afford it.	-1
Err after using less than a year. Wouldn't callobrate correctly and read 7.0 pH solution as 10.0 pH. There's no way to get it back to normal if this happens. It's worthless.	-1
had some problems right out of the box with calibrations could not get it to zero in on 07 I do not recommend this product very poorly made	-1
Just got around to using this. Conditioned it as per instructions, then calibrated, using 7, 10 and 4 solutions, per instructions, then put it away in storage solution, per instructions. Today I brought it out to test the pH of some whey...... after rinsing the tip in distilled water, the unit gave me a reading of 6.8 (the whey should be at most 6.2 at this point). Thinking maybe the whey was the problem, I rinsed again in distilled water, then tested the whey again.... 6.8.  OK, rinse, and this time test the distilled water..... 7.5?  What about our filtered water?  7.9? Tap water... 8.5?  Something's got to be screwy here.... so I rinsed again, then tried the 7.0 calibration solution, which read at 7.2. After recalibration, I tried the whey again, and got 6.8. Distilled water 7.5. Filtered water 7.9. Tap water 8.5. I am now verging on throwing this thing through the window....  Seriously, thing MUST be defective. I wish I still had the packaging so I could return it.	-1
It worked perfectly for about a month. Now, it is complete garbage.  You people stole my money by selling me a pH pen which is only suppose to work for a free weeks. Seems like they are designed to fail at the warrantee marker.  Anyway,  it will not calibrate, it thinks tap water at 7.3pH is over 10pH.  I cannot adjust it because it says, "Err" and will not program if the sensor reads 1.3pH +/- what it suppose to be.  Example, if your calibration fluid is pH 7, your meter might read 8.3.  When you give it the 7.0 buffer for calibration it tells you ERROR.  Error!!!  Why error????  It will not calibrate, this thing is expensive trash.  Shame on you people who seel it, You KNOW its a ripoff fraud and piece of junk.	-1
I read most and as always I read the negs first. So far it's one star for packaging and one for the usefulness of the product (at least what I can use of it). Please read: I really needed this piece to replace a garage window and I didn't feel like getting a glass replacement. The size is bigger than what I wanted which is fine with me.....the problem is, most of it is scratched and the film paper covering it has been ripped away especially in the middle where it's the worst place to be. The packaging was opened upon arrival and the only packing material inside was a small piece of butcher paper. No receipt, nothing.  I'm going to use it for the intended purpose but knowing the middle is scratched up is upsetting and once again, disappointing. I'm not going to contact Plastics 2000 or who ever sent it because it's probably futile. I always have good luck with all Amazon.com purchases and shipping has always been great. You can read my other reviews to confirm that. This time I got a goose egg.  UPDATE: I forgot to add this in. During the ordeal of cutting this with a material specific saw blade, it shattered and frayed along every side I cut. This product is an absolute a disappointment. Live & learn I guess.	-1
I have been using plumbers putty for 35 years. I use it indoors and out. This putty doesn't work for more than 10 minutes. The other I have used last from 7-10 years.	-1
Terrible won't even cut thru thin gauze.  Save your money and put it towards a good pair of shears.	-1
Returned Item - the lids did not fit the tubes - too large	-1
These were exactly what I was looking for, right size, capacity, everything. Although, 8 of the 10 tubes were broken beyond salvage upon arrival. Shipping box was not damaged, but 80% of the product was damaged. Be wary of ordering these.	-1
I've ordered two sets of these primarily due to their inexpensive price, and they're plastic.  However, much like other "cheaper" plastic products, the quality suffers when the price lowers.  These were pre-scratched beyond recognition nearly, and it caused a difficult time to see inside the test tube in which we were examining.  Fun for the toy box, not for the presentation.	-1
Very fragile, I broke few just trying to put the cork..	-1
Yes.  The tubes come with cork stoppers.  Too bad the corks weren't fitted for said tubes.  Waste of money, and lost opportunity for students.	-1
They are great, but these caps were NOT made for these tubes. You can BARELY get the stopper in the tube at all, not even close to about half way to seal like the higher quality ones.  The redeeming features are the price and they are actually pyrex.  I am on the fence if I would buy again.	-1
I tried to resolve the issue through Lake Charles but they would not help as this was an Amazon purchase. Disappointed.	-1
The test tubes are nice  a bit larger than expected...that's a bonus.  I would have rated higher but several arrived broken	-1
Item not as described.  Supposed to be 10 test tubes, but instead I received a box of broken up glass.  The rubber stoppers seemed like they were good quality.  At this point I don't even want to deal with returning them. I need them this weekend so I'm going to have to drive to the lab supply place across town.  At least I think I can buy the cheaper stopper-less ones and use the stoppers that came with the broken glass and save a couple bucks I guess.  Pretty sure they will fit the ones at the shop.  Even had them come whole, the fact that they were all broken and the box wasn't even creased anywhere makes me think they were unreliably thin.	-1
Two  tubes arrived broken. Not worth it to return. I think it was packed well. Shipper probably played basket ball with the box.	-1
Very fragile, thin walled, packed poorly. Don't buy these. Half of them were broken when they arrived, three more broke on first use. Save your money. Buy some other product	-1
No holding power. The swivel wouldn't hold for anything. And I broke the base while hammering on the anvil	-1
In most respects, the item was as ordered.  BUT, the untextured (smooth) side was unprotected with any sort of film or paper (as it usually comes from the manufacturer).  It had a very "shop worn" appearance with numerous scratches and scrapes.  For a person who wanted/needed an even sheen or shine, the item would have been totally unusable.  Realistically, you couldn't (and shouldn't have to) polish out the damage.  In my case, I want that side to be non-reflective anyway, so will treat it with a sander or wire brush to even-out the appearance.  When I buy a new car, I expect it to be delivered damage-free -- and I think the same could be said of this product.  For my purposes, this would rate 4 stars, but I want to alert other potential buyers, so it gets only 2.  If you folks at Plastics 2000 expected to "slip one by" with silence about the poor quality, you're dead wrong.	-1
Don't care for the material that these packets are made out of. Not sturdy enough.	-1
these are terrible valves, both the threads for the handle had already been stripped, had to return	-1
This is the second one they sent me. Both run for 2 seconds and turn off., They both did the same thing. They sent me two different batteries and chargers were not the problem. Its in the electronics I guess. JUNK	-1
Mixed feelings on this hand-vac and returned it after it's first use.  It did a decent job of picking up hair, etc on its first use.  Easy to use and manageable.    However, a design flaw (or oversight) prompted a quick return on this after the single uses.  The "heads," including the powered brush head, only "press" into place.  There is no snap connector, latch or similar method of securing the attachments in place.  In familiarizing myself with the "Shark," I noted the motorized head had to be "jiggled" and reset into pace EVERY time at start up.  Also, while using the vac. the motorized head would stop spinning as the electrical connections would very easily lose contact.    Unfortunate, really.  Bad, or cheap, or untested design (or all three) prompted a fast ship back to AMZN as I could only picture myself cursing this thing every time I attempted to use it in the future and constantly fiddling with the press in place attachments.	-1
Bought two - just quit working and company would not back them so they are in my scrap pile - worthless. Poor design and customer service.	-1
Didn't get this handheld vacuum from Amazon, but I did buy it from a local store and would like to share some info. This unit worked initially once charged for 24 hours after taken out of the box. All of a sudden about 2 days later, it would not work at all and the charge light would not even light up once set on the cradle. After reading many bad reviews about battery life I decided to actually open the unit to take a look inside instead of returning it(I am an electronic technician). I found a circuit board directly below the on/ off switch and what I found was interesting. A transistor on that board was not aligned properly when soldered at the factory. See attached images. After placing that transistor in place and re-soldered its connections, this thing works like a champ. I believe this can also contribute to the battery charging issues people have been experiencing. Hopefully this post will help some people repair their unit, being that their customer service department is horrible.	-1
Poor suction to begin with and after a year the battery holds so little power that it can barely pick up lint.	-1
This is the second one I bought. First one just quit charging. Second one after only a few uses quit charging too. Waste of money. Too late to return. Charge light comes on for a few minutes then goes out and will not charge of run at all. First one lasted a year or so and bought at Walmart - this one here bur same problem but very few uses. Emailed them but no help or way to help them improve or renew my faith in Shark at all - if they will help me I may reconsider.	-1
Had this about one year, and it worked fine. We have a long haired cat, and cleaning the brush was problematic and time consuming, but the vac did get the hairs up off the floor. Then, one day, I got it to use on the stairs, and it would not start. The battery showed full charge, but it was dead in the water. Nothing. Kaput. Way out of the warranty period, so being a skilled handy man, I began taking it apart and testing each component as I did. Battery was in excellent condition. Impressive. Front brush cleaner worked great. Main vacuum motor also was great - very powerful. I was  jumping the components to test them and using a VOM as well. So, bench testing was all OK. Hmmm.  However, after narrowing down the components, I discovered the switch was dysfunctional. I found a small component to the switch's circuit board that had fallen off. I first jumped it, no joy; then I re-soldered it, but still nothing. So, conclusion was that after a year of good use, the circuit board attached to the mechanical switch failed. No way I could replace or repair the circuit board. So, I had to deep six the whole thing. Sad. I won't buy another one.	-1
What a piece of junk. And what an incompetently designed item. For shame. Especially hilarious is the way  the additional battery cell was crammed in, probably after the whole design was tooled up and the pilot run found to be unsaleable with its anemic suction.	-1
I bought this junk on monday got it wednesday, followed the instructions by charging it fully. Ran it until dead then charged it again. It ran for 10 seconds & shut off. It broke, died, done. No clue what happened. It recharged fully charged in just a few minutes but still won't turn on. So I attempted to replace it but the price went from $46 to $63 !?! In just 3 days??? I'll try a dyson thanks.	-1
Battery loses capacity quickly. Doesn not stop charging battery when fully charged -> damage to battery	-1
Dont expect the fully charged battery to last long as it runs down very quickly. The brush works good for small debris. Charging takes some time too.	-1
Had this hand vac for about a year. The batteries wouldn't take a charge after awhile and found that these are poorly designed for charging and maintaining the batteries. I've seen other reviews about the charger shorting and burning up. Probably related. I had the batteries replaced just to have the impeller shatter a couple weeks later. Looking for a better design elsewhere.	-1
Failed in less than a year.  The unit can't remain plugged into the charger per the instructions.  There shouldn't be a device on the market without this simple battery charger shutoff circuit built in.  Stopped charging fully and there for working.  Tossed it.	-1
Na.  Older models of this product far exceeds performance than these newer ones.  I have two old models and two new ones and the comparison between them is huge.  These newer models don't seem to charge all the way or run time is less than half of older models.  Charge light may go out and the switch may not have any effect.  Bottom line is that when it runs, it is a perfect product for pet owners.  UPDATE:  Two 780s later... One would run a reasonable time.  Second will run 2 minutes and quit after a full night's charge.  Unit is great, but batteries suck... like being very healthy except for the stage 4 cancer.  Ordering replacement batteries from Shark is stupid as they cost $15 higher than a new vacuum!  Too bad Shark has not figured this out.	-1
they work "ok' you still have to use prep sol or something else. not what i expected	-1
Not worth buying. Not only is it almost grey, but looks more like Boltaron. It is smooth on both sides. Horrible product	-1
cuts and edges were not even close to even or straight	-1
This stuff is way too thick.  Although the ".080" measures right at .08, this stuff measures like .073-075.  As such, there's no real point differentiating it from the .080...  This stuff is too thick.  Lame.	-1
I really like the Closys products, and a few year baseline indicates that it is at least a good and maybe a uniquely good product for me (fewer deep pockets, and generally great gum health).  I wanted a small mouthwash bottle with which I could travel, and had been using improvised solutions, but the 100mL bottle appealed to me and the label would make it a little easier to distinguish in my travel bag.  I discovered, though, upon unpacking after my first trip, a terrible flaw in the design of the mouthwash bottle: the bottom lip of the cap bottoms out on the shoulder of the bottle before the cap top seals to the threaded neck of the bottle. In short, the foolish thing leaks by design, and with pressure changes in aircraft, it is not academic.  I unscrewed the cap and (carefully) used a razor blade to slice off the bottom few mm of the cap, and it now seats well to the top. This should not be necessary! So: 5 stars for the product itself, minus 3 stars for the lousy design.  (I refill the little toothpaste tubes by forming a 'kiss' of it with the larger tube and squeezing the larger tube. Takes some practice not to lose a lot of toothpaste, though!)	-1
