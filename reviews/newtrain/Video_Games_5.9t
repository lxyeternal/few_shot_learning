This has got to be one of the more fun games I have ever played.  If you have ever been a sci-fi fan, if you have ever seen The Matrix, this game is a must.  The fun factor alone is worth having this game.  Like any other licensed game there are some drawbacks. First the finer points of the game.  Good graphics and rendering give this game a good start.  Sound effects are sharp as can be (after a fashion).  Game play, while no longer unique, is very fun and engaging.  There are several levels that flow well enough.  There is a hacking program that you can use to access different parts of the game.  Once you beat the game there is a one on one fighting mode.  (You need two controllers plugged in to access it). That being said there are some down sides.  The visuals of the game are not always up to par with the movies.  The game can echo during some of the cut scenes.  Some save points are to close while others are to far apart.  Due to the release date the game has a rushed feeling to it.  I personally believed it would have benefited from some more development to polish out the bugs.  Other than that it is a great action game I will recommend, ESPECIALLY if you're a Matrix fan.	1
It arrived very fast. I thought that for it being used that it was in excellent condition. The heart came off with a little cleaning and it was given as a gift.	1
Let me start by saying that I did not purchase this game, but I rented it for five days. In that span of time, playing maybe one to two hours a day, I finished every nook and cranny of the game. There are several elements that are both very intriguing and utterly laughable. To understand what I mean, let's break down the various aspects. Graphics: While the Full Motion Video (FMV) is quite pretty, the rest of the game suffers from flicker and choppiness. There's nothing more annoying then trying to block a punch and having chop move the character animation faster than your fingers. While the world of the Matrix is recreated very nicely, there are places in the game that appear flat and lifeless. Still, the look is pretty well done, so 8/10. Sound: The music, the sounds, the voices. All are recreated quite well from the movie, which is lends authenticity. However, in certain areas, like escaping the Post Office, the sound of crackling fire can become annoying after a while. But, since the sounds are so faithful: 9/10. Controls: I have a little gripe here. While most of the controls are intuitive, there are moments where several enemies surround you and the default controls mean your fingers have to bend in almost yoga-like positions to stay alive. 6/10. Overall: This game has great replay value as you get (almost) different stories with the two characters. Lonely fanboys will enjoy the girl on girl kiss during Niobe's section (think about the film with Persephone and you'll understand), and some diehard fans will be upset at how the game truly mirrors the film's plot (rescuing the Keymaker...twice?) Still the preview of the third film at the end of the game is better than the one after the film. While the game has a good script and some fun moments, it does suffer from its control scheme and choppiness. I would call it a solid renter.	1
This game is an awesome game! You can chose from either Ghost or Niobe(Ghost is easier). You have different missions. Like Niobe must fight people while Ghost, flips switches, press buttons, and back her up! Any who, your main mission, is to defeat Agent Smith and his crew. But first, you must find the Matrix in-order to because, Agents are too powerful for you. You must kill anyone you see, except for the good guys. Like the S.W.A.T, the Army, the police, and Agents etc. are bad guys, and Niobe,Ghost, Morpheus,Trinity, Neo, ect. are good. This game shall please all. It has slow-motion, violence, no blood, 10-12 different choosings of guns, etc. Nothing is better than this game. Words can't even explain this exciting game. You must witness it yourself. But, let me tell you this, once you lay this game in the palm of your hands, you'll never let go! It's addictive. It's not related to the other Matrix stories, but it's the coolest. Hears what I think of the game: Graphics:5/5, Colorific! Weapons:5/5, No Bazooka's, but it's tight! Clothes:5/5, I love Snake skin! Villains:4/5, The villains are not that slick! But cool! Levels:5/5, so many, It's like the game will never end! Overall Gameplay:10,000/5, COOL DUDE!!!!! This game is "GRRREAT!!", but don't take my word for it! See ya!!	1
I played this game hoping to see cool cut sequences and I did see cut sequences, but nothing cool. I felt bad that I had paid $ to view an ad for Matrix 3. I felt that the gameplay was not only weak but also boring. It was exceptionally easy. The only good thing about the game was that the CGI in the game matched the terrible CGI in the movie, so I felt like I was actually playing the movie. If you have to play this game to see what was not in the movie. Don't waste your time or money if you're interested in gameplay.	-1
This is an excellent game brought out by Atari, and developed by Shiny. Speaking of graphics this game has them. The game runs at a smooth frame rate even during large fights. Contrary to what the box says, this game does in fact have multiplayer. It can be acessed by unsing a cheat code in the hacking mode. The fighting sequences are awsome and the action is very fast and furious. You can play through the game using two different characters, Ghost and Niobe, both of whom make appearances in the newley relseased film. To top it off the game packs in a little over an hour of never before seen fotage from the film and also a short trailer for the third and final Matrix movie. I my opinion the unreleased footage from the movie is worth the money. Another cool feature of the game is the ability to enter and exit slow motion at your onw pleasing. In slow motion, you can see the famous bullet time effect and you can dodge them. Overall an excellent game, with only one drawback which would be some graphical glitches. Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Replayibility: 5/10 Multiplayer: 1-2 Players (With cheat) Online: No	1
For years, EA Sports' FIFA series has been the definitive soccer game in the U.S. However, Konami's Winning Eleven 6, which has been the most popular soccer game in Europe and Japan all these years, makes FIFA look like Midway's Red Card games, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But if you are looking for real football, like you see in the World Cup, this is the game you want to get. Winning Eleven is much more realistic. If you sprint while dribbling, you have to worry about the ball being too far in front of you. There are no cheap goals where you sprint past the last defender and take a cheap shot at the keeper. I played a game earlier today where the final score was 1-0. I had six shots, the computer had four. Those are realistic stats. Every attack has to be strategically thought out and executed carefully. When you do score, you feel like you earned it. I only have a couple of complaints about the game. First, there is a limited selection of teams. In FIFA, just about every club team imaginable is available to play. Here, you just have the biggest national teams and a few club teams. Also, there is no world cup mode. There is a season mode, and a few other cup modes, as well as an excellent master league mode where you build a team and play through several seasons. And finally, the issue that plagues most sports games, A.I. Every once in awhile you can see one of your players just standing there watching the guy with the ball run right by him. These issues aside, Winning Eleven 6 is a pretty good game. If you want a fun game to play with friends where you can score a bunch of high-five inducing goals, then stick with FIFA. But if you want real football, this is the game.	1
This is an amazing game!  This game is loaded with action!  Play as Niobe or Ghost.  Go through the game with loads of gunfights and bullet time!  In each level you fight off cops, agents, and SWAT teams!  Cheat Code:  Infinite Life- 7f4df451.  This is a must buy game!	1
the system played great some minor sratches on the bottom but nothing serious.  There are no scratches on the screen.  All the buttons worked but was dead when i got it. so buy a charger haha.	1
I bought this game after playing and conquering FIFA 2003. I was very unhappy with Fifa and sold it wihtin severals week after buying it. I was reluctant to buy any other soccer game on the PS2, until my friend inform me that this game was a much better game. Enough of the history, about the game: The game has a various area but I will focus on 3 main ones that I use: (1) the Training sessions, (2) Match Play and (3)League play. (1)Training is very well done, training is broken into various sections (eg passing, shooting, pk, etc.) This helped me understand the buttons and refine the special moves. would recommend if you are having a tough time playing the game. (2)Match Play: This is very quick method of playing, national, league or 'create your team' play. The game play is really well done and the settings of the annoucers are flexible (mentioned below). The stadium images are great as well the playability and ref calls are pretty on the spot. You will have a tough time winning a league if you are not competitive in this play. (3)League Play: This is the next level of play from Match Play. It is great that you can select the teams you want, you can make as competitive (or not) as you wish. All the great playing features mentioned above are available on this play. Special features for me were: - Saving some of your goals is the best way to show off your goals and compare moves to friends. - Annoucers language settings (spanish, italian, french, etc) Would recommend to all soccer fans, great for individual play or group play! Have fun.	1
I can't believe how good this game actually is. I was skeptical about it, I thought nothing can be that good. FIFA is the best game there has ever been, since SNES Fifa 1994, Then I had Fifa 2000 for PS and Fifa 2002 for PC and PS2. I never thought a better game could be created. I was wrong! I started playing WE6 level 2 of 5 and it was hard. Although I was only beaten once it took me a lot of games to finally score thrice, most games ended 1-0, 0-0, 1-1 or 2-1, No shellackings. Then I played along with my 4 yeard old son and he enjoyed it a lot. Before, the only sports game he liked and played was NBA 2K2. And it was a lot of fun playing with him helping me. Now I have become addicted to this game. I started playing on level 3-5, and boy it is tough, it was not until today (three days later) I could score multiple goals in one game. I never got to score more than once even having a lot of one on one's against the goalie. Finally today I got to score 4 goals in one game and three in another. Still I don't think I'm ready to go to the next level, because in between those two games I lost with a golden goal 1-2. The Highlights at halftime and at the end of the game are marvelous, the players move and act like real soccer players. The best replay is the one of the camara in the net it looks just like a real game. There's no way you can do the same play over and over again and score on "cloned" plays. You might do everything just the same but maybe the striker doesn't jump as high and heads the ball over the net, or the defender is ready to anticipate the play. In order to succeed you have to play as a team you can't have the star of the team dribble everyone and score on a full power shot. You have to make a team play and have the perfect touch to score. Even watching goals being missed is excinting. The only thing against this game is the no licensing, but who cares if Real Madrid is named Navarra, you still get the idea that you are playing with the best club on earth. By the way, I'm not Spanish. I'm Latin a soccer fan by definition, this game is incredibly good. Still I can't believe it, and beware IT IS ADDICTIVE.	1
The one shown, in very pretty light silver gray is the older version.  It has two settings but the first is really poorly lit.  This is the older model, not the SP. These were lit from the front somehow, I was told, not backlit.  It is much less desirable then the newer ones I am about to describe.  I bought it out of sentimentality because it was in beautiful condition.  This model later came in colors either gunmetal(dark gray), or pale blue or pale pink and id referred to as SP. The improved backlighting that lets you do either a normal or a brighter viewing is truly wonderful and presents beautiful games that look like the Sunday comics colors in the funnies of many years ago.  The detail of the games is remarkably superior to the earlier ones that were made in red, black, or bright silver as the one mentioned. The newer ones were totally improved  These newer ones in pink, blue or gunmetal are the best that - in my opinion- were invented.  While improvements continue to be made in an ever-changing and updating market, there is nothing like these compact, pocket-sized Game Boy Advance SP handy and beautiful game players.  They last forever (so it seems) and recharge quickly, lasting quite a while before needing recharging again. The have a volume control.  The Warioland 4, Zelda, Mario Pinball, Castlevania, Collapse II, Tetris and certain other games that stack and fling a completed row...you probably known what I mean..are really wonderful on this type of compact.  While the exquisitely-made smaller (miniature) machines are truly works of art, they are harder to manipulate and strain the eyes a bit.  They do not have the choice of a bright or brighter screen but are also the more modern backlit kind.  They have less volume.  I would worry about eyetrain in a youngster, the same as too much time for young eyes viewing any computer screen but the difference is that today's computer screens often allow an enlargement of whatever material is to be viewed.  As I mentioned, The one we are talking about, the Game Boy Advance SP(ecial) is portable ...absolutely perfect to fit in a pocket.  The games are two dimensional and some of the games can be preserved so that you can turn the thing back on and  return to the same place where you stopped.  Some can be played till you get everything you need to then advance to the next level.  These games and the units themselves, are treasures.  The power cord/charger unit is still available...online if nowhere else., Some games don't let  you store the achievements and allow turning off the unit, but the Game Boy Advance SP does this., depending on when they were created, pretty much.  I bought a bunch of the earlier games that were very primitive, just out of fascination for them and to appreciate where a game like Warioland 4 Super Hard Level is about.  Not many people even know about this last one.  Kids would not know how to pursue it to this high level an  not probably have the patience or wisdom to figure it out.  Not to put down kids because they are creative and fantastic little buzzards....I could learn a lot.  I am 75 and at was 73, when starting on this adventure, had to figure out every single move by trial and error.  What a thrill to find the place in the wall that allowed Wario entry, for example, and how to avoid and overpower this and that.  Beautifully created and devised.  Some day it would be fun to tell the people who created these beauties what a contribution to the world of art and electronics they have given.  I wish I could say that I was as good at the other games.  But if you are coming up to my age, and a woman, and never had anything like this as a child....get started with Warioland 4 and eventually Mario Pinball.  Just  don't bother with the gladiator on the end of that game.  The trip is great but the designers dropped the ball with the ending.  I have won it twice.  It is not worth the adrenalin it takes.  Couldn't sleep after putting myself under that kind of stress to have the design of the game not respond properly.  As ;you can see, I can not say enough good things about these wonderful things!  Who says that we had it all, back then, does not understand, that those of us still alive, had it all, and now again have it all!  Great.  Just great. Sorry if this seems really wordy but I wish someone had written all of this for me when I had a lot of questions.  nancy morse	1
My personal favorite handheld video-game system. It isn't region locked, so it's perfect for ANY gamer. It also ages well.	1
For a first class soccer playing experience, give World Soccer Winning Eleven 6 a try. Its impressive gameplay and graphics will impress even die-hard fans! First, the gameplay. This isn't an arcade game that depends on frantic button-mashing and obscure button combinations. The buttons let you do real actions - run, pass, kick. You can do each action in different strengths and with different angles, creating just about any situation you'd see on a field. This makes the game quick to learn but also one that can be honed for months. The edit options mean that you have great customization control over the players and teams. You can play in match mode, league mode or cup mode. For a given game you can customize everything from the difficulty level to the 'slant' of the commentators. You can choose from 56 national teams and 40 club teams. You can customize your own team, negotiating for players, even creating your own flag and uniform. The graphics are simply stunning. The characters on the field all move like the actual players, with different running styles and of course facial and hair styles. The stadiums look realistic. There are flashing bulbs when you score a goal, and the replay options are very fun to watch. The sounds are great too, from the commentary to the crowd cheering and singing chants. A definite hit for any soccer fan in your world!	1
I have been playing Fifa since it came out on Sega, that's a long time. Best Fifa game has been 98, then 2002 and to some degree World Cup 2002. But Winning Eleven beats them all by far. Why you ask. Its simple, Realism! When you play a match on winning eleven it feels and looks like the real thing, not those precise crosses or never-ending bicycle kicks you see in Fifa, this is truly a football simulation. With some few minor adjustments this game can actually dethrone Fifa from the shelves forever. First they need to buy all the club and national team licenses they can. The club teams for example Milan, Barcelona all have different names. They need to add more club teams from all over the world, for example Argentina and Mexico. The game narration could use some help, even though you can here the game in German, French, Spanish, and Italian, that is a definite plus. The formation strategy window is perfect; both players can modify their team's formations and substitutions at the same time. And there is an endless array of formations and you can create one if you can't find the one that suites you. And last they could use a better name for the North American market; winning eleven just doesn't cut it. I could go on with what's great about this game, the training sessions, the tournaments, etc. Remember when eight of your friends got together and played a world cup on Fifa, each one choosing a different team. Well you can't anymore, leave it to those geniuses at EA. Well EA bad news, your not the only Football game that is out there anymore and beware because Konami has done what you should have done years ago; Listened to your Customers! I'm just fed up with Fifa, Fifa 2003 was the last straw, its horrible, just plain horrible. So play my Futebol fellow mates, because Football doesn't get better than this. At least for now. Score one for Konami.	1
I used to be a fan of EA Sports FIFA soccer games but having played Winning Eleven I will never go back. Winning Eleven delivers a stunningly realistic soccer experience that requires concentration, creativity, and patience. It truly does make FIFA look like child's play. In addition to the stellar gameplay the game offers an excellent variety of league and cup modes, plus a solid training mode. The only negatives are that the game is not fully licensed so club teams have fake names and some players have fake names. Also the game does not feature any on-line capabilities.	1
I was lukewarm about this game at first because of all the bad reviews.  Well, maybe those reviewers have more taste for challenge and less thirst for violence than I.  Because, personally, this is not the BEST game I have ever played, but it is the game that made me FEEL the best by far when I was done.   I haven't tried the good ol' PS2 version yet, but I've used my friend's Gamecube extensively.  And on that, the graphics are great.  No squares, no bad voices, no odd things.  So, message to you with things like Atari and computers:  stop whining and get a new system if ya don't like the graphics!   But the gameplay system is what makes this so grand, even if it had the horrible blotchy pre-rendered feel of, say, Resident Evil 2.  Your best friend in this game is called Focus, which essentially slows the world (most of it) to a crawl.  Bullets chug by your head, leaving those lovable shockwave rings, as you execute all those moves you've seen in the movies for the sole purpose of whipping someone's ....  Doing the moves is not complex, but really rather seamless: you point in the direction you want to go, and choose a button; your character will automatically adjust to the environment (I.E. jump off of a wall and do a neck-breaking kick.)  Sure, it's easy.  Well, people, climbing onto a roller coaster is easy too.  It's also one heck of a ride. A few things I'll sum up: Pros:  Nice graphic quality (on some systems), totally unique and awesome gameplay system, nice dovetail with the movie, actual live-action cutscenes with good acting (nice change from Resident Evil!),  great selection of real-life guns, Slo-mo bullets, front flips, side flips, any flips, flying forward while spinning and shooting, flying BACKWARDS while shooting, beating up on agents, beating up on SWAT teams, beating up on random people... Cons:  Yes, I will say it...it's easy.  (So stop playing on easy mode.  Did you ever think of that?  Wow.  Brilliance.)	1
These are becoming rare.  They were made to last and I love the several I have been able to buy.  They are the perfect pocket size and their batteries last a long time before needing recharging.  Somebody ought to start making them again!  Love this  one!  Nancy Morse	1
better than the original advance model very compact and nice love the color needs more games tho i wish i could get one for my wife	1
One of the best games. The graphics are GREAT!Unlike Max Payne you can use slow motion when you want to. You don't have to dive like in Max Payne to use slow motion. Tons of weapons to use. Pick from 2 characters. Levels aren't all the same for both of them. They swear not to often. You even get to drive a car or sit shotgun. SO this is a MUST get game!	1
this game was horrible.  often times you can't see items and there is nothing to indicate that something can be done with say a wall or a paiting unless you happen to try an object on it.  You don't interact with charecters really at all.  the only times you even see other charecters is once when a man comes in babbling nonesense, or at the end where the story still didn't make sense.  things dissapear from your invetory and don't like to reappear.  i had to start the game over three times.  The puzzles are illogical and HARD.  I was constantly looking for cheats.  my opinion: this game is not worth two cents!	-1
This so-called "game" is one of the worst [things] I've ever seen. [Bad] story, [bad] voice acting and badly rendered environment come with bad controls. Puzzles are [bad], no clues, you have to do lots of thing "just because". Every puzzle MUST be done in a strict order, otherwise you cannot proceed. To find items, you MUST check EVERY pixel on every scene. Avoid this "game" at all costs...	-1
This may be an interesting game, but the screens are so dark that detail is impossible to see. I have run this on 2 XP machines, one with a flat-panel display and one with a CRT. Both screens are much too dark at even the correspponding maximum brightness settings. That, coupled with a very hyperactive mouse speed [also not controllable] render the game virtually [really] unplayable. I recommend "SAVE YOUR MONEY!"	-1
Thank you so much again it works perfectly thank you again and sorry for the late response I've been busy with my job.	1
Never has a movie based game been as good as Enter the Matrix. This has very fast paced kung-fu fights, awsome looking slow-motion gunfights, sweet car chases, and adenline-pumping agent encounters. It also has an hour of exclusive footage done with actors from The Matrix: Reloaded and has very close ties with the movie. You cant fully understand the movie without this game, and you cant understand alot of this game without also seeing the movie. The action is uncomparable to any other game on the market of that genre, unlike most action games where you go through each level shooting everything, here you can get up close and do complicated and fast disarm moves and unleash a devistaing series of punches kicks. The focus(Bullet Time) move has never before been used so well in a game. In Max Payne, you could barely see the bullets fly through the air, but in Enter the Matrix they are big, shiny, and leave a trail of soundwaves behind them, making it an awsome experience to dodge them or fire them. Also, when using focus you can run faster, jump inhumanly long distances, run up walls and 360 kick someone of of it, and do many other special moves not available in regular speed. The car chases are not quite as good as those in a James Bond game, but are still pretty good. The interactivity with the enviroment is the thing that stands out from all the other car chases in video games: Streetsigns fall when shot at, those annoying "Your speed is ____, the speed limit is ____" signs explode when driven past at 100mph, windows shatter when you crash into buildings, but there is an awful lot of fog when doing this, and a little amount of innocent traffic in places where there is supposed to be swarms of them, like on the highway. While the car chases arnt perfect, the gunfights are almost so. Focus moves are extremely important to this game, and unlike max payne, is not just a thing to make it look cool. You can barely hit a wall while running and jumping in normal speed, but when you turn on focus, your accurasy boosts much higer because of the slower moving targets, you can pinpoint the heart of a guard after running up a wall and somersaulting off it and then diving headfirst over a deep gap. The slow motion gameplay makes this a blasts, and not only is it used in gunfights, but it also makes your kicks, punches, and throws faster and more stronger, this is very essential when fighting an agent, vampire, or Seraph, in fact its almost impossible to win a boss fight without using a few focus moves somewhere in there. The fighting engine is also great, this could be a great fighting game, only they decided to make it better with the gunfights. There is a wide range of kics, punches, combos, and focus moves, and each one is slightily different whether you have a weapon out or not, for example, when you try a throw move while unarmed, Niobe/Ghost will pick up the opponent and throw them, but while armed, he/she will grab them by the neck, crack it a bit, drop them outward and shoot the opponet in the neck at a point blank range. The liscensing here is also used just as good as the Star Wars series used it's. You will fight many opponents from the Matrix movies, and some that barely made an apperance in reloaded become much more complicated and deep in this game, particualrily the vampires. There are also some heart-pounding agent encounters, imagine, running down the streets of chinatown whith eight agents behind you, all of a sudden, another one jumps out from a window in front, backing away, you quickly turn around and run the only open rode you see and find yourself diving through the window of a tire shop, the owner crouches down and whimpers, you run to the back about to open the door, when you hear some strange noise coming from the owner, you look and an agent stands where the owner was crouching, you elbow open the locked door and quickly run to the pay phone ahead, but all of a sudden someone throws a grenade and it blows up. The chase continues on and eventually you find yourself running across rooftops, sprinting up stairs, and diving through glass. With such great agent chases, forget The Getaway, Enter the Matrix is the most movielike game out now.	1
Works very well and has almost no damage on it! Takes me back to the old days and makes ya feel young again	1
At first, I was apprehensive of playing this title.  Most of the time, games based from movies, TV shows, and cartoons are nowhere near the same calibre as that of originals.  They're just a way for the companies that franchise the name to make a quick buck.  But that all changed when I got behind the controller and entered the Matrix.... Enter the Matrix features some of the best animated martial arts I've seen in a game.  The real-life mapping of the moves leaves you laughing in astonishment as your characters punch, kick, and flip enemies with incredible accuracy.  The game also features a slew of guns, from pistols, to submachineguns, even sniper rifles and grenades, all used to dispatch your foes.  Plus, it features a gauge similar to that of Max Payne's "Bullet Time" where you can slow the action down to dodge gunfire and perform even more stunning hand-to-hand combat moves on your opponents. Rent this game if you can.  It will definitly be worth your time to check it out.  And, if you're happy there, go ahead and buy it!	1
Maybe I didn't get far enough into the game to be blown away, but what I played was boring and frustrating. The controls were difficult to use and after expecting something amazing, the gaming event of the year, I was very let down. The visuals are great, but that's about it. If I wanted great visuals, I'd go see the film.	-1
Thanks again for the sp now I can play all the old games I had. Thanks again for this item. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because it won't charge, so I might have to get it repaired.	-1
Ok Yeah this game looks great, Yeah it has good controls , yeah the moves and combos and slow motion stuf is all cool. BUT!! the fact that every level is the same thing over and over again is totally boring, all you do is beat up and kill cops over and over in each level, it gets a little old after a few hours of that. every once in a while you get to fight an agent, other than that its pretty much just beating cops up and shooting them. the game is WAY too easy as well, levels are too short and the story is not interesting. every once in while you get to drive a car around and get away from cops and you guessed it SHOOT them. this game is only entertaining for about the first few days, then it just gets repititious. Worth a rental but in my opinion not worth buying.	-1
this game is very very good and most of all fun it kept me entertained for hours and when i beated it i still came back for more the combo moves are awesome and using the focus mode to make things slow down a.k.a bullet time is neat also i also like how you can switch to guns or hand to hand combat i am very very surpised that this game snuck past with a t rating i thought it would get an m rating because shi* is said alot and there is lots of voilence anyways this game is awesome if you like the matrix movies then you must get this game this is the game that will keep you coming back for more Graphics 8.9 the graphics are quite good Sound 6.5 i found the sound quite tricky i kept turning up my t.v Gameplay 9.7 awesome addictive gameplay Replay Value 8.6 has a great amount of replay value also	1
this is very durable and strong it works well and long battery life it plays for hours and is small to take anywere	1
Well at one time or another we all dream of doing the cool things in the Matrix but since we can't they did the next best thing, make of video game about it.  Whats cool about the game is that they shoot actual live footage for that's in the game only, you won't see thisstuff in The Matrix Reloaded.  So it has it's own story line that adds on to The Matrix Reloaded and whats cool about it is that you won't know the story unless you play the game (Wonder what the other charters besides NEO were doing?  Wonder no more).  This is by far the best game thats based off a movie.  One other cool thing, when you beat the game you get to see a trailer to the Matric Revolutions. Okay now about the game play, well basically you are fast as hell and you can't beat everyone down that is normal.  There's a button that lets you slow things down and do all that cool slow motion action. You only get to play as two characters Niaomi and Ghost, I didn't mind much, I mean if you got to play as NEO you would either already no the story from watching the Movie or you would spoil the movie. The basics of the game is to beat everyone down, there isn't really a strategy. Bad Points - Sometimes your characters stays locked on to NPC that are already dead and you get your ass kicked by the baddies and it is only sometimes, not all the time. - Load time is horrible and the levels are pretty short, oh when you die, you have to load all over again and start from the begining.  (Ya it sucks) - There's a part in the game where the voices start echoing, it gets very annoying. Good Points (End with positives) - You get to fight Trinity - You get cool moves with the touch of a button - Awesome weapons That's all I can think of at the moment, now the big question 'Should you I buy it?'  Well I don't know, if you a big Matrix fan you probably already have it and if you don't you should buy it.  If you're not, well... you will have to decide on your own.  Is Slow motion and a whole lot of gun fire and fighting really worth the money?	1
After trying to play this game I now know why noone in the cast wanted to take part in the game eather through a likeness or voice. The game is garbbage,do not waste your time or money on it it is not worth it	-1
I've stopped playing it three days in.  While the environments and sound were nice, the character graphics were pretty bad.  The movement of the characters was suspect and I'm not just saying that because I hate games where I have to use the thumbstick to move my character (at least in Vice City I get the option of using the directional pad vs. the thumb-cracking joystick); these characters moved pretty ugly. The targeting system was non-existent and illogical, the driving portions of the game atrocious and the in-game movie footage, while superior and meaningful, not worth the hassle of gettig form one piece ot the next, especially at the price most people will pay for it getting it out the gate.  The hacking section was a good idea, but in the end fairly pointless.  Unlocking the multiplayer was cool until you realized that the characters you coudl fight with in these new environs didn't have the "focus" (bullet time) feature enabled, so they just did regular kicks, punches and throws...all of which, by themselves, was not up to industry par in a game with this much buzz.  Being able to do real combos would have been nice, as opposed to the smash the buttons and see what happens fighting engine we're pretty much subjected to. I'll be returning my copy because of the game's many bugs (PS2 versions have been freezing while playing Niobe about halfway through and there is an incessant sound echoing in some of the cutaways) and because of its Atari 2600-Pitfall-esque replay value.  What it does right it does very well (movies, the focus feature), but when it misses, it misses hard.  Practicaly all of the gaming elements that are the real reason why you bought the game have been done better in other games.  It's pioneering in scope and license relativity, but the game - the reason why people are sitting in front of this thing - fails.	-1
Enter The Matrix brings gamers into the world of the matrix. The game is a lot of fun for all Matrix lovers such as myself. You have the...kicking kun-fu action of the movies. You really get to kick a lot of [bad guys] in this game, it's just a very fun and fast paced game. You don't get to pick Neo, Morphious or Trinity but you get to choose between 2 other characters from the new movies. You don't get to choose Neo because he's the one, he's too strong. Mean that's the excuse I read in a video game magazine to why you can't pick him anyway. Not sure why you can't pick Morphious or Trinity at least though.  The characters that you get to use a very cool anyway. I don't know much about them since I didn't see The Matrix Reloaded yet but still they do all the kun-fu...kicking stuff so that's good enough for me to like them, haha. Just take the advice of a character in the first film though "when you see an agent you run". You can easily beat the...cops and other people in the game but only Neo can take on the agents. I tried to fight an agent and he destroyed me easily so don't try that, haha. Anyway if you like the Matrix films then this is the game you got to get.	1
Make sure to buy one in good condition, unless you want the outside scratched all up.	1
I like this console but you want to be a little careful when buying it used.  I got mine used and I have to try multiple times to get it to turn on.  Other than that, it works fine.	1
The Gameboy SP is a nice little handheld system,that you can take with you anywhere. The graphics on this little miracle are outstanding. There are a ton of great games out there that can be enjoyed on this. You can also play original Gameboy and Gameboy Color games on the SP as well. The Gameboy SP can fold up and fit right in your shirt pocket. Overall,this is a nice little handheld to have for gaming while traveling,or for any ol time. I highly recommend the SP.	1
This game is completely awesome! It has a great storyline and great graphics. But,something's missing,you can't use Neo. I'd prefer to use Neo rather than Niobe and Ghost. Oh and something great about this game is that you just press a button while doing a cool movement to put slow motion and the slo-mo camera even goes around your character! Another great thing is that you press that same button while shooting and you make bullet time. This game is great in all perspectives,but I really really really really really wanted to use Neo. I hope there's at least a cheat that lets you use Neo. I really want to use Neo=(	1
:) great product was well worth the money good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good	1
It was a good buy, but the console is pretty old.  the light on it is dim, but manageble.  I would recommand to others.	1
The gameboy works, but it is pretty scrached up.  The light on it is also a bit dim but not problamatic.  There have been one ore two instances where it has opened the game correctly.  But after months of using it, i have no real compaints.	1
Plays Gameboy, GB Color, and GB advance games with the special backlit display.  Even throws in a little color on the original gamebot games.	1
i'm between 20-30; i still use this SP on the long road trips always killed time for me! i have big hands and when i play it too long, my hands cramps.	1
The Game Boy Advance SP, especially the Pearl Pink and Pearl Blue versions, as well as the improved black one, have much brighter screens than the original models, making it much easier to see.  Instead of a dull pinkish color, now reds are truly displayed as reds.  The Pearl Pink color is very pleasant.  It's a rather soft color.  The only thing that could make this handheld unit any better is a headphone port, but aside from this, if you want to play your old Game Boy games or Game Boy Advance cartridges, you can't go wrong!	1
Just as described, my son was very happy with this product when he opened the package.  Well worth the money.	1
i got this for my sone who lost his at school. now he can play all the games. and have fun	1
i have not recieved this product??Where is it??????????? It's been along time with not answere about it what up people can't you find it?????????!!!!	-1
I should of bought this thing when it came out in 2003. The system is awesome! I play with mine almost every day, it really is a lifesaver when I get bored.	1
The GBASP (yes the red one) brings back so many great memories of me excitedly opening it on the best christmas ever and screaming with joy on the top of my lungs. Yes, I still own the GBASP and I still play it. It has an amazing library of games for a handheld console, it far outshines the psp and the 3ds in that area, also the gbasp is very portable and fits in your front pocket nicely. This was the first time that Nintendo thought of giving it a laptop like design where you can fold it down so that you don't have to mess up the screen, and nintendo has done this since with the Nintendo DS family. Another great addition is the backlight, a very important add on that allows you to see clearly wherever you are. The GBA is simple, but its refinements are astounding, not to mention that you can basically play any game from the gameboy generation, from gameboy, to gameboy color, to of course, gameboy advance. It had a huge impact on handheld consoles today, especially nintendo's and its still worth owning for its simple brilliance.	1
I am very happy with this buy. I lucked out, its in good condition as stated and for the price I cannot complain one bit.	1
this is a great system and my son enojoys it very uch it made his birthday better he loes games and if not found on this he is on the computer so he loves it and plays it all the time it is very strong duable relaiable battery live is long charging doesnt take long either i recommend this to anyone or child it is a great system and chaep price and worth it	1
i had one a long time ago, i am glad to have one again, even if it is a  used one. worked great, was shipped fast.	1
Bought this as a gift for myself. Item was exactly as described. Had some usage damage and scratches ect. but is in amazing working order. Thanks so much.	1
What can i say game-boy SPs were , in my opinion, Nintendo high point and the SPs are always awesome (unless the owner carelessly broke them) they are pretty hard to break, mine for instance was perfect. of course there were a couple scartches but that's to be expected with used handhelds, plus you don't even notice 99% of scratches when your playing.	1
It's no secret that Nintendo released a lot of versions of the Game Boy over the years. Six by my count (Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, and Game Boy Micro.)  This, however is the version to get if you want the best experience overall. The way I came to this conclusion is by process of elimination. I eliminate the first 3 becuase they lack the functionality to play Game Boy Advance (GBA) games, obviously, becuause they are the previous generation. There is nothing inherantly wrong with these models per se, but if you are going to go through the effort to track down a portable machine to play these games, it would only make sense to get the best version of the handheld. So they are eliminated.  So we are left with the GBA, the SP, and the Micro. Having never owned a Micro, but seeing them, and reading about them they seem like a cool option. But it has some nagging issues that keep it from being the best choice. First yes, it's cool that it's very small making it the most portable, but that comes at the price of the screen, it's very tiny and text is very hard to read. It lacks the link port, so it can't do multiplayer or link to the GCN. It also lacks the ability to play GB or GBC games. With those kinds of negatives it's little wonder it sold so poorly, this makes them more expensive, and harder to find. Add that to the fact that for a little more money you can get a DS lite, and get so much more from your puchase. It has the same limitations with a much better screen. So it makes it very hard to reccomend.  The original model retains the compatablity (multiplayer and backward compatablity), with some great feeling shoulder buttons and has a larger screen. But the face buttons are somewhat ackward (try playing racing games on it), uses AA batteries and the screen isn't backlit. This is a very common model, but unfortunatley isn't the best for everyday use.  So what makes the SP model the best? In a nutshell, it's got nearly all the best features of the other versions, without most of the drawbacks. That means, it's got multipayer compatablity (which includes conectivity to GCN) backward compatability, backlit screen, a good sized, colorful screen, a great button layout, rechargable battery, and a clamshell design to protect it. Let's go through these one by one.  Multiplayer One of the best features of any handheld has got the be the mutiplayer. I realize not all people utilize this feature but it's worth noting. Games like mario kart, tekken, and advance wars are meant to be played with more than one person. The ability to trade pokemon and interact with the GCN is great too. So it just makes the micro lose so much of it's appeal to me.  Backward Compatablity The ability to play GB and GBC games is a plus in my book. Not that I have that many of those games, but again, if you are going through the trouble of seeking out a Game Boy, why not buy one that can play twice the amount of games. There are some games that are exclusive to the system, so you won't find them anywhere else. the original GB came out in 1989 and had development until about 1998, GBC runs from 1998 to about 2001. Not only that, when you boot up the original GB games you can add a limitied amount of color to the games.  Screens This is where the original GBA falls short. The screen itself is fine. But without direct light it's hard to see much of anything. The system boots up by default with the backlight off, with a simple press of the button under the screen it lights up. The lighting isn't very even, and it does shorten the battery life, but it makes for a much better experience. It's fairly nice sized screen too, it's actually wider than the one for GB/GBC, so you can stretch it with the L or R buttons when running those games.  Button Layout If you've ever tried to play F-Zero on the GBA you know the face buttons aren't that well laid out. They feel okay, but leave your hands crampt if you need to hold the button. I switched the gas to the B button and it helps, but the point still remains. It seems like only a minor change but it makes a big difference on the SP. The micro, from what I am told is even more crampt than the original model. The one thing I don't particularly care for is the shoulder buttons. The original models feel great, with an indentation for your fingers to rest on. The SP, just doesn't have this. The buttons are thinner to accomodate to the clamshell design. What's worse is that they wear over time and stop working. Blowing into them restores functionality for a time, but it is an irritation.  Rechargable battery This is a godsend. While it could be argued that getting batteries for the device may prove difficult over time, vs AA batteries will always be available, but for praticality's sake the rechargable battery is just better all around. Nintendo still sells them through their website. Given the popularity of the model, it's highly likely that third party vendors will offer them even when Nintendo stops selling them. The battery life is about 10 hours with the light on, and 18 with the light off. I suspect it may be even longer depending on the volume and running in backward compatablity mode, again, depending on the backlight usage.  Clamshell design Without a doubt the best way to go. It not only protects the screen when not in use, it also makes the device more portable. There is a reason so many phones still use this design. Some have complained about hinge problems, I have had no such issues. The only real complaint I have is the surface does scratch over time, still, I'd rather the surface show wear rather than the screen.  SP lite /(Mark II)/Model 101 There is actually a newer model of the SP. I simply call it the SP "lite". The only difference between the standard and the lite model is that the lite model has a vastly improved screen. It is not only frontlit as well as backlt, it also is more evenly lit in general, and has much better color saturation. Even when the light is turned off, it is more impressive than the original model with the light on. So it goes without saying that it's worth tracking down if you want the absolutely positively best model. They were only released in 3 colors, Pearl Blue, Pearl Pink, and Onyx Black. Not my first choice in colors but I digress. The way to tell is to look at the model number, the orignal SP is model AGS-001 and the lite is AGS-101. Do some reasearch and pick up this model if at all possible, it may be a bit harder to find, but is well worth the effort.  Complaints I do have some complaints. I think the biggest issue for me is the L and R buttons. While I covered this in the button layout I must reiterate, it's simply a frustrating ordeal to have to blow into the buttons to losen them up every time I pick it up. Secondly, the big complaint from most, is the lack of an apparent headphone jack. Considering this is a portable device, I can see the frustration. Nintendo did offer an adapter on their online store, but it has been removed. Again, third party options do exist, both the adapter to use standard headphones (the better way to go) and headphones made specifically to use that port. The other problem this creates is that it uses the charging port, so you can't charge your SP while using headphones. Finally, I am frustrated by the uneven lighting of the original model, another reason why I reccomend the SP lite.  Closing Even with it's small caveats I still say this is the model to own if you want to play Game boy games. It features almost all of the positives of the other models and almost none of the drawbacks. With this information in hand, you can now make a more informed purchase.	1
My first Game Boy handheld system was the red Game Boy Color system and since then, I've played so many games for Game Boy. I traded in my original purple Game Boy Advance to get the Game Boy Advance SP system in platinum and it's awesome! It folds like a mini laptop, has a slightly bigger screen, improved back light so you can play in dark places and is backward compatible with all Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.  The PROS: It's made from Nintendo so the quality is way up there. It's sturdy, can take a beating and with its new design and choice of colors it comes in, it's the definitive Game Boy Advance version to own that will last for years to come.  The CONS: There is one small drawback that caused a bit of ire among GBA gamers. The GBA SP is so compact in design, Nintendo had to leave out one small detail: the headphone jack. Up until this release, every version of Game Boy had a headphone jack to plug in headphones while you play your games. In order to plug in your headphones to the GBA SP, you had a buy a headphone jack accessory and snap it into the back of the system. While it wasn't too expensive, it still caused some gamers to complain about this issue. Thankfully, Nintendo didn't repeat the same mistake with future portable systems.  The Game Boy Advance SP is Nintendo's second revision to its popular handheld system. Though they did release one more revision with the Game Boy Advance Micro, the GBA SP is still the favorite among the three different versions and would prove to be more valuable in time: with the release of the Nintendo DS (and future revisions), it is backward compatible with Game Boy Advance games only. If you haven't owned any Game Boy or played any Game Boy games, get yourself a GBA SP. You won't regret it. *****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*****	1
There is little doubt that this is going to be one of the top games of 2003. The December 2002 Game Informer Magazine gave this a full-length feature, and it left little doubt that this is going to be a powerhouse game. Enter the Matrix is being developed with a close collaborative effort between gaming industry and Hollywood so that they can create a game experience "as rewarding as the movie." There will be ultra-realistic character movements with the over 4,000 motion captures performed and encoded into the game. We are promised over 200 minutes of in-game cinematics and voices from the actors of the film including Keanu Reeves (bless his heart). You can play as Niobe or Ghost, and you play along side characters from the first movie (Neo and Morpeus). Screen shots look promising with plenty of special effects. Unless the something goes terrible wrong between now and the release of this game, we can expect ONE AWESOME GAME!	1
Yes, it's 2011 and there are more powerful handhelds around like the new Nintendo 3DS and soon the Sony NGP, I myself have a Nintendo DSi XL, but in my opinion, nothing can beat (yet) this perfect little machine called the Gameboy Advance SP, bear with me and read along please.  The first Gameboy Advance released in 2001 was a joke, it was big and ugly, with no lit screen and using standard AA batteries that died in few hours it was a horrible handheld indeed, you had to resort to rechargeable batteries or annoying 3rd party "lamps" to get a good experience out of that GBA. Then the GBA-SP came in 2003 to solve all those problems but it still used a front-lit screen (bad design decision), but soon after a redesign appeared (GBA-SP model AGS-101) with a powerful back-lit screen and it was (and still is in my opinion) the perfect gaming handheld. Be aware that this model is a bit hard to find nowadays, few units where produced, you can identify it by the unit color: Gray (called Graphite), Cyan (called Pearl Blue) and Pink (called Pearl Pink). There is also a Silver GBA-SP with back-lit screen but it is identical to the front-lit Silver, so look in the back of the console for the model, if it reads AGS-101 then is a back-lit device. Trust me, the back-lit screen makes a HUGE difference and a much better gaming.  The unit is extremely small and portable, measuring 8x8x2cms (closed) and at just 140gr it fits in any pocket ready to be carried around, the new 3DS and the PSP just can't beat the GBA-SP portability, they are big and heavy. The rechargeable battery last between 10-12hrs, compare that with the 3-5hrs of battery life of the 3DS or the PSP...  But, what makes this the winner for me is it's compatibility with the hundreds of classic Gameboy (GB) and Gameboy Color (GBC) games, so you have a HUGE library of awesome games for GB, GBC and GBA and you can play ALL of them on this little gem (with some exceptions). Yes, Nintendo will release soon a Virtual Store for the 3DS so you can buy classic GB games and play them on the 3DS, but to me the experience and feeling is not the same like popping in your old GB, charming little cart and play like it was mean to be, and I doubt so much good games like R-Type and Adventure Island will be available on the 3DS.  The GBA-SP may surely not appeal the younger or the people that want the latest cutting-edge devices, but it DOES appeal old-school gamers like me that loved those "real" games on their NES and SNES, with ports like the Super Mario Advance 1-4, Zelda: A Link to the Past and the hundred of classic GB games like Super Mario Land, AND with the ability to play them ANYWHERE, these kind of gamers will feel like in heaven with a GBA-SP, if you loved your classic platforming and shoot-them-up you should get a GBA-SP now. Trust me, this is the perfect console for old-school gamers.  The only complains are the lack of a headphone jack and that some old games are really hard to find, but a big plus is that you can find some of them REALLY cheap, I got some classic games even at 2-3$ each! The handheld itself is really cheap compared to the new ones.  I have my GBA-SP and I'm in love with it, my DSi and 3DS can't just compete with the awesomeness that is the GBA-SP. Get one now, you'll not regret.	1
Plays GBA,GBC, and GB games, really useful and has a excellent battery life,really great option to turn the backlight on/off  If you are going to buy a GBA SP I recommend titles from the pokemon series and WarioWare Twisted	1
The Game Boy revolutionized handheld gaming, the Game Boy Color improved the Game Boy's game library and life span, and the Game Boy Advance blew the entire Game Boy line over the roof!  (Let's be honest: We like the SP, not the original. Light is better than no light.)  The Game Boy Advance is compatible with the Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but once again, it has a new library of games...and it had enough to make it as its own system. This magnificent 32-bit piece of awesomism has made it into our world in 2001, the year before the Color died away.  Sadly, I never thought I'd see the day in which the GBA would fade away....  Let's play some Super Mario Advance and battle each other in Mario Bros. What do ya say?	1
Bought it because of the nostalgia of playing gameboy games as a kid. Its frontlit not backlit but I can see whats on the screen just fine. Plays every gameboy game ever made from original to advance. Clamshell design protects screen. Only issue is that it has no headphone jack built in and is slightly small for adults. My hand tends to fall asleep often from playing it. Still its real fun to play.	1
This is one of my favorite Nintendo handheld systems. I own multiple handheld systems including all three variations of the Gameboy Advance and I feel that I can offer a balanced perspective of the SP system's strengths and weaknesses.  First of all, I am reviewing the Pearl Blue SP (model #101). While the model #001 SP systems are also great, the 101 systems are the best ones to own because they have the nice backlit screens. As far as I know, the 101 model only came in 3 colors, Pearl Blue, Metallic Pink and Graphite. If you're going to buy a Gameboy Advance SP, make sure it is a model #101. It may cost a few extra dollars but they are well worth it compared to the original models.  The screen is nice and bright. It's not quite as sharp as the Gameboy Micro's screen but there is nothing to worry about. I have no problems reading game text and the graphics look wonderful on the SP. Handhelds usually do not have great speakers and that is the case here. You can easily hear voices and music so it's not bad by any means but it just isn't as good as listening through your ear phones. Unfortunately, this system does not have a headphone jack but I believe there are some third party headphone adapters out there. Let me be clear, the SP doesn't sound bad at all... it merely sounds okay.  There is only one other gripe I have with this system. The shoulder buttons are significantly smaller than they are on the original GBA or the GBA Micro. That may or may not be a deal breaker for you but I have big hands and like the comfort of the Micro's larger shoulder buttons.  However, the SP 101 systems have a very important feature that is lacking in the Micro line. They can play the original Gameboy games as well as the Gameboy Color library and of course, the Gameboy Advance titles - all on a beautiful, backlit screen! You can get Gameboy and Gameboy Color games for around a dollar each if you're savvy so you can build up a decent game collection in no time. This is truly the best system for retro gamers who want to play Nintendo's handheld titles.  I'd give the SP a five star rating except for the slightly lower quality screen (compared to the Micro), the lack of a headphone jack and the small shoulder buttons. It's a great system. I just happen to like the Micro better for GBA games but the SP rules for the older titles.	1
I've loved the first two movies of the Matrix and got this at a swap meet for a couple bucks. The reason I'm playing it so long after it open was because many scenes tie directly into the movie. We don't see the whole story in the movie but had to play the game to get why something happened. I don't like this because that leaves two sources to go through to get the movie. The game was rushed to market and there are many, and I do mean many glitches and bugs in game. Many levels are just your characters walking through a hall way but here's the kicker. The game controls are old school. ONE ANALOG STICK controls your character. That leaves the camera in automatic and yes there are times you can't turn around to fight an enemy behind you. There are some glitches like the Sewer flashlight thing that can be worked around. You can't move forward without the it. Yet, you can't pick it up. (shoot some rounds off of your MP5). The way-point arrow is slow and deceptive. It doesn't point to where you really want to go and when you get there resets to another location entirely. The game's graphic and content is okay and the cutscenes adds to the experience of the movie. I am very frustrated playing this defective game because of the research online to find ways around the bugs. One review in a game magazine said it best. "The only thing complete about "Enter the Matrix" is that it's a complete mess." Yes, it is.	-1
Jameson Thottam staying away from the Matrix  Movie licenses... If you've read my rant over them in my Wolverine's Revenge review, you'll realize how sick I am of the clichYin them. As soon as I saw the very first preview of Enter The Matrix, amidst the hyped-up phenomenon surrounding what was "undoubtedly going to be the best game of all time, just because it has bullet-time in".  But straight away, when I realized it was going to be yet another "Third-person action/adventure featuring lots of guns" I was so disappointed. The Matrix is worthy of a lot more than a shallow action-adventure - I'm imagining a vast RPG/adventure taking players through the many ins and outs of the Matrix and real world...  Still did it anyway ~ Jameson Thottam ~  But despite my apprehensions, I began to catch onto the hype. Even highly-acclaimed European magazine Edge was saying the combat system might just be something special, so gradually I began to catch onto the phenomenon. I still decided to rent first...but predictably I completed it over two days.  Read on & Jameson Thottam  If you're reading this thinking "what the hell is The Matrix?", I'm sorry, but this is not the review for you. Look at the many movie reviews of both The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded for story details. One of the main selling points of Enter The Matrix is that the game features over one hour of authentic Matrix film footage filmed especially for the game, with a story parallel to that of The Matrix Reloaded. It was every marketer's dream - a trilogy of smash-hit blockbuster movies, a sellout game and an accompanying DVD of short films, the (admittedly better than the movies) "Animatrix".  But the Trust is out there (Jameson Thottam)  However, when I went through the game I want to clear up that I didn't find the new footage that great. I actually don't think they were filmed especially for the game, and seem more like deleted scenes from the film - there's little big-budget special effects, instead average conversations with minor characters. I ended up skipping through half of them as they were so damn boring! I think the designers made a big mistake by making the playable characters tiny supporting characters (Niobe and, erm, "Ghost") from the film - who the hell wants to know about the love life of "Niobe"?  Let's get back to the game --Jameson Thottam  So, onto the game itself. At first play, the control system is incredibly difficult. Rather than having shoulder buttons to control the camera, everything is done with the left analogue stick. At first this was incredibly fiddly and awkward, but within about an hour it felt incredibly natural. Your character handles combat with Square, Triangle and Circle and jumps with X. But now onto the selling point of the game - bullet-time.  Chalk it up to Developers # Jameson Thottam #  I've got to hand it to the developers, the bullet-time is superb. You can recreate the cool-as-ice stunts from both films with incredible ease, even in some familiar locations - remember that lobby scene from the first film? You get to play it in Enter The Matrix. The moves are handled by holding down a shoulder button and basically doing whatever you want with the other buttons - it's not tricky or complicated like, say, Tony Hawk's (to think of a game with complex controls...) and flows perfectly, just the exact way youd want it to. Hold down the button while running to a wall, and youll run along it. Hit jump, and your character will flip off, shooting non-stop. Before you land you can flip and kick an enemy in the face, before grabbing his gun, hitting him in the head and shooting him on the floor. Eventually youll reach the floor. Amazing. But of course this can have some major issues, and brings up one of the games most critical flaws  Wasted time.... Jameson Thottam  A lot of the time I felt as if I was randomly bashing buttons and watching a film on the screen. Now that is worrying. No matter how cool a game looks, if I feel I can pass just by pressing random buttons, theres not really any point in playing it. No doubt about it, the bullet time is incredible visually and you can feel really cool while playing, but there is no skill involved whatsoever C no sense of achievement or reward.  As well as the combat, the rest of the levels consist of, er, running and jumping. Thats about it. Theres no real exploration involved, as a GTA1-style arrow directs you to your target pretty much immediately. Its probably the most linear game this side of Final Fantasy X, with little variety added to spice up the levels. Occasionally a brief change is put into the levels C the inevitable covering with a sniper rifle level, and incredibly annoying boss battles that verge from the stupidly easy to the downright frustrating.  But don't give up hope yet C there are a couple of other modes of game added in as an attempt to add variety. Theres quite a lot of driving levels that quite frankly suck. When playing as Niobe you drive, and when playing as Ghost you shoot other cars. Usually these levels involve you chasing other cars through incredibly blocky environments in some lame copy of Grand Theft Auto. Theres good news and bad news C the classic highway sequence from The Matrix Reloaded is included. The bad news is its driving down a completely straight road chasing a car, and the big action takes place in a following cutscene. Strangely, as easy as chasing a car down a straight road might sound, if you even crash once, you fail the mission as the other car drives ahead C but the game tells you five minutes later. The levels are marginally better than Ghost C I suppose shooting cars in a first-person perspective is a bit more fun than driving down a straight road.  The End Game ; Jameson Thottam  At the end of the game is an absolutely diabolical set of missions in which you captain a spaceship through identical tunnels being chased by robots. The environments are constantly exactly the same, and half the time you don't even know where you're going C one time I backtracked through the whole level before realizing I was going the wrong way. As a finale to whats allegedly such a cool game, its a huge disappointment.  Another gripe I had about Enter The Matrix was its insistence to have the bigger action in cutscenes. Isnt this supposed to be the game of the movie, and not the other way round? I bought this game to play as the characters doing cool stuff C not to watch overly blocky characters doing moves for me.  Hacking Systems {Jameson Thottam}  Theres also a hacking system. Dear God. Imagine the MS:DOS window, where you type in random commands on a hugely basic screen. Its like that on a supposedly next-generation console. Ill be honest, this part of the game wasn't created for me, but I attempted to get into it and its pretty much impossible without a walkthrough C there is absolutely NO explanation of what you do or how to do it. Allegedly you can unlock secret bonuses and levels from this, but you should be rewarded in a better way than your ability to find walkthroughs or guess words.  End of the Day \Jameson Thottam  So at the end of the day, Enter The Matrix is hugely fun at times with incredibly cool visuals, but loses a lot on the basis of the extra levels and the sheer shallowness of it all. If you treat Enter The Matrix like a typical bad videogame license, youll come out happy, as its one of the best of the licensed crop at the moment. If you treat it as the masterpiece it should have been, you will be hugely disappointed. Dont get me wrong, the bullet-time parts are fun as hell, but its just too shallow and the trick wears thin.  Oh, and rent, don't buy. I completed everything in four days. Four. Days.  Ouch  Jameson Thottam	1
the gameboy sp is a great system but i wouldnt pay no 250.00 dollars for one when u can just go get a nintendo dsi xl or a wii for that amout just to let you ppl know :)	1
For all Super Nintendo lover out there that miss 2D games now it's at your finger tips 32 Bit graphics 32,000 colors on screen. I truly miss 2D games and now its all here on the Game Boy Advance SP play it anywhere including the dark that have a built in light screen. Buy it and play all your old school favorites.	1
this is a very fast paced video game which requires many cool moves and requires split second decisoins to beat.the kung fu is awesome! you can grab up all kinds of weopons and blast the crap out of everything.theres even a pretty nifty matrix mode which lets you do the "in your own time "thing to where you are at normal and everyone else is seemingly moving like snails.this is quite likely one of the coolest games ive ever played and you should really check it out.	1
This game truly has some of the best graphics in a video game. The characters actually look real. Now look, i'm not a huge fan of the Matrix series. I like them, i'm just not that big a fan. But I bought this game cause it looked pretty cool and it was cheap and it was awesome. My only complaints are the last two levels where you drive around in that thing and shoot those electric squid things and then the cheesy ending which sets up the film "The Matrix Revolutions". But anyway, I played as Niobe and the character looks real, they sound real. The shooting looks real and the focus thing is really cool. The game however is relatively easy, I beat it in less than a week and I suck at video games. But this game is really fun and I highly recommend it. A-.	1
The matrix. A great movie. A grand movie. Enter the Matrix? Find the exit quick. Fortunately, you can be told how bad this game is, you don't have to see it for yourself. This game is a dissapointment. The movie was so great, hype surounded the game, it came out, people were fooled.  Bad graphics + glitches + bad control = bad game.  If you have twenty bucks then simply buy a tom clancy game (splinter cell, ghost recon) or for ten bucks more get Halo. But please, please save your trouble and stay away from this game. Please don't be fooled. And if you don't believe me- rent it.	-1
The girls (Jada and Bellucci) kiss.  That is cool.  Once you see that, just stop. Just to let you know how awful the controls are, on the XBOX version, the fire button is the little black peripheral button.  No, not the trigger--that little one you use for your lights in HALO.  God.  The genius who configured this mess ought to have his shins slapped by baseball bats all day long.  This whole game is about as responsive as a plastic sled on gravel. But the chicks do kiss.  That is, and will always be, cool.	-1
Someone got me this as a birthday present - and I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it myself.  If you REALLY REALLY like the Matrix, I'm sure you will enjoy the game, but it is pretty easy and the plot line is almost non-existant.  Some of the slow motion moves are fun - but they get old after awhile. Bottom line...  save your money for something better.	-1
Every little fake matrix fan out there complains about how this game is so easy and stuff.  But for hardcore matrix fans like me and anyone else who is a bada**, you will love this game.  This game automatically gets a 5 star rating of "perfect" because for christ's sake the hott penelope french chick makes out with niobe.  Girl on girl action is probably one of the best things that have ever happened to a video game.  Plus this game is full of hours of just breakin policemans necks in slow motion.  Nothing is better, trust me.	1
i played Enter the Matrix, and it's a really good game. i love the whole bullet time feature and all the stuff you can with it. from running on walls, to doing all sorts of jumps and cartwheels, it's awsome. shooting while in bullet time is AWSOME!!! you try to shoot the agents and it's exactly like the movie. they just duck, you can't hit them! only problem with this game is that some of the levels are just to short. there should have been longer levels in the some parts of the game. driving isn't to bad. it's real easy to pick up. the highway chase scene is pretty cool, and the music really gets you into it. they also add scenes from the movie like when Morphis falls on the hood of the car. haven't played all the game, but from what i've played, it's good.	1
This GB is much better than the GBA but it still has some things wrong with it. When i got this when it first came out i thought it would be much different but i was wrong. My friend had one just before i did and i thought it was awsome because it fliped up and u could adjust it to where u want it, and the screen is much brighter so u don't have to use a light anymore. It even gives u a choice of how bright u want it by just pushing a button. I thought it was a complete different GB but it is just a fancier one. It still plays the same games that the GBA did. But it was worth it. It is just like the ds lite and the dsi, one step up from the GBA.	1
This really cheered up my daughter. The DS is kind of the same to this I guess. Although, it does have a good design. So, I gave it 4 stars!	1
This game really is outstanding.  My biggest complaint is the graphics.  Surely the development team could have done better in that area.  I've played Max Payne and this is the idea that spawned that.  Bullet time's done better here as well. Choose from the two main characters in the movie(which I haven't seen by the way), and battle your way through normal guards, agents and I'd expect the twins as well.  You have to do things like taking out helicopters, stopping a plane from taking off, and there's even a hacking feature.  I lost interest in this game, because I used to be a computer nerd and was disappointed by the shortness of the hacking.  That notwithstanding, the action is good, the gameplay is tight, and the story is awesome.  I'd advise renting before buying, as usual, but if you're a Matrix fan, this is a no brainer that doesn't disappoint.	1
you have to play this game.  Go threw the game fighting agents swats and dounut eating cops.  Tons of guns and martial arts moves.  Bullet times the best part of the game.	1
it gets bad.  Not just bad but monotonous. There is little variation in the game and as far as FPS and other shooters I have seen, this is a mess. Driving the cars is difficult.  There are endless shootouts and running and running (did I mention running?) through long levels that just become so boring you could fall asleep.  There is little variation in the levels, the lighting is bad and the sound is dismal. Sparks your "operator" is so whiney and can't act very well.  Jada Pinket is hot and fun to play .  .  .  the rest of it. There are glitches and the so called "clues" and "fill-ins" to the movie the Matrix Reloaded are so nominal (nothing you could have figured out yourself) that you don't really miss anything. I am surprised at the Warchoski Brothers.  This game is so [crummy] and buggy and the story is so dull and disposable.  You won't miss anything if you don't play this one.  Not a thing.	-1
Good game system exactly like the game boy color system only more modernized and higher technology and it folds and has a back light and rechargable battery pack to just plug into the wall cool game system though it plays the old school game boy games, game boy color games, and the game boy advance games defently excellent game system.	1
This hand held system was and still is amazing. Some great games have been produced for the system. Downside: On the older versions the colors were a bit to grey and were not true. Also once the screen cracks for some reason, if it be frustrated and thrown, you might as well trash the system. The repair is not worth it at this day and age. Positives: You can play in the dark and if you need to avoid getting caught you can turn off the light. The battery life is also good and its rechargable. Saves money spent on batteries for sure.	1
the gameboy advance is my favorite gaming device.  it singlehandedly got me into handheld gaming (never owned a gameboy before), and to this day, 90% of my game time is handheld.  the original came out, i bought a glacier, and played the hell out of it for two years (even installed my own Afterburner backlight.  now that was a chore).  it was worth every penny.  the games themselves.....so many to choose from.  all the mario advance games, the castlevania series, tactics ogre, final fantasy titles, puzzle games, baseball advance, the tony hawk series (which was incredible), racing games, the list is almost endless.  when nintendo announced the SP at E3 several years ago....it was love at first sight.  it brought new life back to all my games, and even today, although i have a DS Lite as well as a gameboy player for my gamecube, i still break out my SP for short bouts of on the go gaming.  it fits perfectly in my pocket, has a fantastic batter life, and an incredible gaming library.  ten years from now, i still wouldnt be surprised if people still play on this thing.  pros: small inexpensive backlit cute as all get out huge library of games backwards compatible with GB and GBC games attaches to the gamecube  cons: hmmm.  expensive for people with no jobs?  so, if you want to get as much bang for your buck on a handheld gaming device....pick this puppy up.  no disappointments whatsoever on my end.	1
Enter the Matrix redefines the action genre. It has mind-bending special effects, awesome move, and of course, that alwways loved slow motion effect. Put it all together, and you have one of the coolest games around. This game has to main characters: Ghost and Niobe. In the beggining, you can choose which character you want to play as. Both characters do different things during the game, so it's like two games in one. The controls are relatively easy. To attack: Y and B. To dodge bullets: A and X. Like I said, easy. Shooting a weapon is a little bit harder than running up to a person and knocking them out, put it is easy to master. The XBOX version is, in my opinion, the best version, because of the placement of the joysticks, and the graphics are the best. It also has over one hour of footage from the movies, and after you beat the game, it shows a trailer for: The Matrix Revolution (which by the way looks awesome). Overall, this game is one of the best games you can get for your money (and did I mention that it is incredibly long?). It is well worth it. Graphincs are state-of-the-art. Mind bending special effects. Kick [butt] kicks and punches. All-in-all, a great game well worth your time and money.	1
Honestly, from a gamer who has been playing every game on the xbox this is a classic. First of all the game play is immersive and gets your blood going. The 'focus' and combo moves are easy to use and though i can't work out why they didn't use the left trigger to fire as per usual, i can't complain. The controls take a little time to get the hang off, (but then don't most new game controls),  and the system is brillant at being able to make up for your mistakes at times when using focus. Meaning that at times when i leapt of a wall and went to hit a guard but knew that i had missed the control goes on auto and smacks him anyway providing some brillant moves that you can't help but go 'WOW, DID I DO THAT'? at. The graphics are good, they certainly aren't as bAd as some players go on about and i love graphics over gameplay. For me the best games are the ones that are graphically enhanced and keep my visual stimulte going. I mean if i just wanted games for excellent gameplay and not graphics id buy a PS2. At times it can get a bit 'blocky' but overall the graphics are excellent and i thought the whole atmosphere complimented the overall feeling of the two movies. As others have mentioned the cut scenes are top notch and really show how these games should be made. It was enthralling to get every bit of story and it really is the best i can think of to actually watching a movie and playing in it. So, gameplay was good, graphics excellent and cut scenes brillant,(if not the only way these games should go with telling storylines). However, with the good there is bad and these are few and far between for me. First of the car sequence was terrible. It really was shocking and will go down in history as the worse driving play ever. I played as both characters and had the chance to both drive or shoot, (if u play one character , Niobe, your driving, the other, Ghost. you shooting), and for me shooting was too simple and driving too hard, (but thats just me). it ....really seems like a quick add on to the game. It also interupts your motion with the shooting, focus, combo parts. I just started getting use to the system and they shove in a car sequence, ( and a really bad one at that), that breaks the momentum. The AI are a bit weak and all the gamers that go on about them are right but once again this didn't distract me from the overall enjoyment of the game. Some levels seem impossible, some are so easy its just a matter of getting from here to there. Once you get use to the controls your set. Finally one last piece of advice. U SEE A AGENT...RUN! Buy the game , its good, it looks fine and its not that hard to play ...... Enter the Matrix!	1
Se lo regal a mi hijo menor para que no sintiera celos porque tena que compartir uno con su hermano. Horas y horas jugando. De verdad que la cantidad de ttulos que se consiguen nos hace mantenernos entretenidos. Pero para los nios de hoy en da si tiene ms de 7 aos lo que le interesa es un aparato ms poderoso, mejor calidad de grficos, pantalla ms grande; les recomiendo el psp.	1
Received the game quickly, in good order and for a good price.  My daughter plays it a lot and it is holding up well.  Will purchase again from this source.	1
Only behind the DS, which was executed great, and very revolutionary and still is (November 2004 - October 2007, and beyond!!!)!  The Flame is the best of the best of the Nintendo SPs. It actually looks more orange than red. Red-Orangish.  It's a beautful system, and when you fold it shut, the screen shuts down, and a green light blinks, letting you know that it is using minimal power.  I owned one of these for a good year, year and a half. But then I sold it to an ex-friend's brother for 40 bucks. Forgive me, I was desperate, and wanted a DS (although I didn't put the money towards one =P)!  All in all, a great, reliable system that can be used years to come!  I hear that the pink and light blue ones have better battery life and a brighter screen, like the Nintendo DS Lite.  Worth a purchase!!!  Pros:  Great games Small Colorful Did I mention the great games that came out for this???! Comes with a charger Charges rather quickly  Cons:  Too small for larger hands Some of the games were mindless (Looks at 95% of the Disney games) (Is ashamed to be a human) Scratches somewhat easily  If you take care of it though, you won't have to worry about many scratches. Also, if you lose your charger, they're dirt cheap here at amazon!!!  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nintendo-DS-Game-Boy-Advance-SP-Rapid-Home-Travel-Charger-with-IC-Chip/dp/B000VBB69M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance SP Rapid Home Travel Charger with IC Chip</a>	1
This game is simply awesome. the gameplay is out of this world,graphics are definitely cut above the rest. There are actual scene from the movie,chase scenes. But judge for yourself and discover one of the best game of the year.	1
I am very pleased that I rented this game instead of buying it. I'm not too big of a Matrix fan. I thought the first movie was great and I thought the sequel to be kind of a flop. The game Enter The Matrix, in my opinion, follows the second movie down the same dissatisfying path. To be fair, the graphics are great and the kung-fu\gravity bending gameplay is unprecedented and fun to watch. The action moves you can perform play like some of the fight sequences in the films. Unfortunately, the action combos and the wall walking gets old really fast. After about an hour of doing the same martial arts combos and jumping over bullets I began to grow bored with the gameplay. I found myself doing the same thing over and over: Follow the trails, shoot the same guards, do the same moves. There is no variety in this game. You fight and easily kill dozens upon dozens of generic swat cops and security guards.  You easily get an auto-lock on your target, jump through the air and shoot them.... OVER AND OVER AND OVER, LEVEL TO LEVEL TO LEVEL. Gameplay is much too linear, and the lack of any sort of rush coupled with the same recycled orchestral music playing in an endless loop left me wanting more. The game didn't convey any real 'get up and go.' Just the same bad guys for you to kill in different rooms. In summary: Pros: Great graphics, great gun and explosion sounds, exceptional gameplay as far as manipulating the environment(wall walking, bullet dodging etc..), Agents are intimidating and fun to fight, clever interposing between gaming and movie clips gives you a better understanding of The Matrix. Cons: Poor lighting and shadows, TOTAL lack of variety from level to level, recycled enemies and recycled musical score resulting in monotonous levels of easy shoot-em-up gaming, Unchallenging combat interface: Enemies are weak and predicatble, lacking any sort of surprise tactics or skills equal to your own.  If you're a fan of The Matrix and are just dying to get any sort of Matrix fix before the next film, then you will probably make this game work for you. If you're a first person shooter fan looking for anything to bridge the gap from now until Halo 2, maybe this title will keep you interested for a night or two. - It's no miracle in action gameplay. Allow the river of hype this game has generated to float to the wayside with the rest of the garbage. Worth the rent, not the buy.	-1
This is an amazingly fun game. I was blown away by the fights and I had a great time doing the missions. This game is also koo because of the fact that it coincides with the Matrix. If you are a big fan of the movie and don't already have this game,get it!	1
she uses it here & there but enjoys it when she does!	1
The Enter the Matrix video game, although under some categories does not compare to its other bullet-time predecessors (bullet-time is the act of slowing the speed of the gameplay to allow for a true Matrix-esque experience) but is still a fine addition to any gamer's collection.  If you are a strong, true fan of the Matrix trilogy that would understand the relevence of this game to the series, then it is without question a must-buy.  First off, this game has easily the best bullet-time (or "Focus") of any video game on the market to date.  The player can at any time slow the speed of the gameplay, allowing for special moves to be performed such as the act of running along the walls, dodging bullets, performing barrel-rolls, etc. The player can pretty much act out any fancy move that they saw performed in one of the movies, from punches and kicks to shooting-dives and midair kicks.  Still, with all of these abilities fulfilled, the game lacks a certain flare to it to give it that true Matrix feel. To let out a few of the bad points, the interiors of the game are a bit too simplistic for my tastes; everything you could see on the screen is very square and unimaginitive besides the characters, and although there is an extent of interactivity with the environments, it could have been pushed to a much better level.  It has sparkling marble lobbies and office complexes, but what it needs to give it that big city, gritty feel are some torn up environments in desperate need of repair, like those seen in Max Payne.  The buildings are solid and well designed; but the question is, does that truly add on to what the Matrix is?  Though I do talk down the indoor environments, I was one to find the outdoor on-foot areas quite appealing; (in one level, you are running away from an endless swarm of Smiths in Tokyo; it is very well rendered with stylish fog and a lovely eye for detail) other than that, there is nothing to be impressed by as far as the interiors go. A very, very disappointing part of the game is all of the driving levels.  Though they give you plenty of freedom to roam as you please, would you really want to drive around in a city with Midnight Club 1 - quality rendering, absurd physics, ridiculous A.I. and a pathetic draw distance?  It's these levels that cause me to shake my head at the developers.  The camera is completely locked on to the vehicle (assuming you play as Niobe; if you play as Ghost, you're in the gunner's seat with an annoyingly random aimer that makes things extremely difficult to shoot) making it feel so very thrown together and adding no life to the cityscape, there are NO civilians, other cars won't even so as stop for you and the police can be dealed with effortlessly, even on the hardest difficulty.  The developers most definately could have pushed themselves further as far as the driving levels go. The music, although stylish and suiting for the atmosphere, could have been selected much better, and gets extremely loopy at times.  They should have just stuck with techno tracks for this one, and not enough of the classic Matrix orchestra is used (it's pretty much the same track clipped apart to sound a little different.) I know what one would think after reading this review; "Why would I want the game?!"  Simple; the bullet-time is absolutely incredible and the overall fighting physics are some of the best I have ever seen.  The story is well written (which is what one would expect from the Wachowski brothers) and ties along with Final Flight of the Osiris and Matrix Reloaded perfectly, and I guarantee you will have a blast with this one.	1
This game has great graphics and vivid levels. The focus ability is great and the choice of weapons is wide and varied. The only thing wrong with the game is some of the levels are too short and pretty much pointless. The level with the SWAT helicopter seems too difficult for being so close to the beginning of the game. There were things that I liked like the choice between two characters and also the refilling of your life as well as focus meters. No looking for a health pack here. Also fighting agents is really fun! Using focus in combanation with gunfire is fun and refreshing.	1
I ordered this for my 9 year old daughter, my mom has one and my daughter got "hooked" on it/the games. I had only one problem when i ordered this item, which was fixed quickly. I didn't recieve this item, even though it said on the "track pacage" that it was delivered. I e-mailed customer service about it, that first e-mail i recieved back from them stated to give it a few more days & i waited.. still nothing. I contacted them again, stating just that.. i don't believe the problem was amazon or the company's fault that i bought this from. I believe the fault here is my mail carrier (or it was taken once delivered?)  Amazon put a new order in for me, for this item.. and i did recieve the item today actually at no cost to me.. which i'm very grateful for. I think they have wonderful customer service! I think my biggest issue was the fact that this expensive item was MAILED to me by (usps) which is why i didn't recieve the first order. It should have been sent by ups instead.  The game unit itself from what i've seen so far, seems to be great! (no issues there) Hope this helps you all who are thinking of buying this.	1
If you're looking for value in a portable game with very good battery life this is the one.  I use it while flying because as you should know, it's veeeery boring to fly, the battery last decades and some game as with any other console are very entertaining.  And it's almost the cheapest out there!	1
Of all the games that have ever spun off a movie, Enter the Matrix is definitely one of the best I've played in quite some time.  Although the game was a bit over-hyped, it is in no way a bad game.  In fact, its one of the most addictive and entertaining games I've played in a while. First off, one of the most interesting parts is the fact that the game was actually produced and supervised by the Wachowski Brothers.  With movie footage shot exclusively for the game using the real actors, the game's story is conveyed clearly and with excellent production values.  The story is actually a side-story to the Matrix Reloaded, so everything that occurs during this game does in fact affect the plot of the movie.  While you won't necessarily have to play the game to understand the movie, the game does help to explain alot of things from the film. You get to play as either Niobe(Jada Pinkett) or Ghost(Anthony Wong), the crew of the Logos.  Each character has a different path through the game, with different levels and cut-scenes exclusive to the character, making for some high replay value.  As the game progresses, you learn more of your character's backstory and their relationships with other characters, which is an interesting aspect.  Other characters, such as The Merovingian, the Twins, Cain and Able, Persephone and even Trinity and the rest of the crew make an appearence. As for the game itself, the action is intense.  If you see it done in the movie, you can do it in the game, everything from rebounding off the wall to deliver a roundhouse to your victim's face to cartwheeling around bullets while firing your guns to kicking your fallen enemy about 20 feet away from you, sending them sliding across the floor.  Using the 'Focus' button slows down time(ala 'Bullet Time' from Max Payne), allowing you to perform more lethal martial arts moves and throws, perform greater leaps and acrobatics, and giving you a distinct advantage in gunplay and other combat situations.  The hand-to-hand combat is arguably the game's strongest point...I had so much fun on certain levels that I replayed them several times over.  The amount of interaction with the surrounding environment is very high, and makes the more intense hand to hand fights (such as boss fights or the Merovingian's chateau) much more enjoyable.  I can honestly say I had more fun with the hand-to-hand combat in this game than I have in any fighting game that's come out in the last few years, and that's saying alot! Other modes of gameplay involve driving.  These segments are not quite as fun as the regular action game, since they can be pretty frustrating.  The physics on the cars are pretty bad.  Depending on which character you choose, you will be either shooting or driving, though sometimes the roles will be reversed.  The 'flying' portion of the game, in which you get to pilot the Logos, is somewhat more enjoyable than the car driving scenarios, but can still be pretty frustrating at times.  Depending on which character you choose, you will either be piloting(Niobe) or manning the guns(Ghost). A great extra feature is the 'Hacking' mini-game, which allows you to unlock more features in the game, such as secret levels, more mini-games, cinematics, cheats, and other features such as allowing you to drop weapons into certain levels to use.  It takes a little while to learn but that's the fun of it.  Once you become good at it you'll find yourself unlocking tons of new things. Save points are frequent...while the game is not easy you will never end up making tons of progress only to have yourself killed in one of those typical overwhelming moments and losing all your progress.  It doesn't make the game easier, but it sure does beat the frustration factor down.  No need to worry about losing anything! Despite all the game's good elements, there are a few problems.  The graphics, especially for an XBox game, could be better.  They aren't bad at all, but they definitely don't push the power of the system.  Its not that big of a problem, but nitpickers will notice.  The game is a tad glitchy and the control is sometimes unresponsive, which can lead to frustrating accidental deaths.  The camera is a bit touchy as well.  It has a tendency to whip around suddenly or focus in an awkward position.  This is particularly annoying when you are trying to focus on a particular enemy, or when you want to watch the opponent you just kicked go flying out a window and it ends up focusing at a bizarre angle.  Other problems include just plain bad animation.  One particular example is in one of the earlier levels, where the objective is to shoot out the wheels of plane.  The animation is so blocky that it looks like it was done on the Nintendo 64 or PSOne.  The graphics during the car chase scenes also leave alot to be desired. Aside from that, the game itself is really alot of fun.  I see many complain that the game didn't live up to expectations...unfortunately people just hold too high of criteria for games lately.  Just because the game is based of the Matrix doesn't mean its going to be the Messiah of video games.  It's a very fun and addictive game, and that's all that matters to me.  So if you are a fan of the Matrix, get this game...the story alone is worth the price of admission, and I gaurantee you that you will have a good time playing.  Go into this game expecting the game of the year, and you'll be disappointed.  Go into this game expecting to have fun, and you'll be satisfied.	1
First off let me say that the game control is a bit hard to learn at first but once you get used to it, it's not half bad. The story line matches perfectly with "Reloaded". It's almost like watching the movie from a different angle. With good plot points and all the orginal actors in the game, I recommend it.	1
I love my gameboy sp!  I remember having the original gameboy when I was a kid and this brings back those memories w/ Nintendo's classic games along w/ some great new additions. The screen is easy to see and has amazing color. It is very compact and easy to use. The battery lasts forever!  Not to mention pink is very cute....	1
I enjoy videogaming but sometimes find my hands cramping up due to arthritis. The GBA SP is wonderful! Lightweight, small enough not to put too much pressure on the base of my thumbs, and a big, bright, colorful screen, what more could you ask for? It's compact enough to tuck into your purse or pocket and instantly makes the time spent sitting in waiting rooms or standing in lines less tedious. I love the Pearl Pink color.	1
Pros: - Bullet time. - Music gets you in the rhythm of the game. - Blowing up cars in the car chase sequence is a fun distraction. Cons: - Repetitive. - Cannot strafe! How do you dodge bullets in bullet time if you can't strafe?! - Graphics on XBOX is very poor- looks like they took the lowest common denominator of graphics and just cloned it for each platform rather than chosen higher resolution textures or applied antialiasing. - Bullet time effect does not show up in cut scenes. - Camera gets in the way of the fight scenes. Recommend playing Bloodrayne instead and enable bullet time all the time. You get much more satisfaction of seeing bad guys getting diced up into tiny little bits in slow motion. ...	-1
The new Enter the Matrix game really represents it. I am not really into action games if I say so myself, but this one is like a movie. I started by playing it at a friends house and everywhere he turned during his turn was action. It was scary and gave me the chills during I being the spectator. Ok, so the game is violent. But this one is realistic. If anyone could make a game this realistic, I wonder what the future will be like. Enter the Matrix is for people ready for violence. I would not reccomend this to anyone under the age of 9. It is unappropriate to those toddlers. Pros: Killer Graphics, like an action movie. Play from Niobe to the Ghost. Isn't that great. Cool features. Cons: Yawn. Ahh! Too much action. Kinda gets boring! Without the cheats, you're gonna die! Suggestions: Get cheat codes, or face that this game, even at an Easy mode is going to be very hard, too hard. To sum it up the Enter the Matrix experience is very great. It is like a movie!	1
LOVED THE GAME.  JUST FUN SEARCH AND FIND.  NO FIGHTING (WHICH I DISLIKE-RUINS THE GAME).  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  GREAT STORY AND INFORMATION.  THANKS GOT GAME.	1
... The first thing that I found annoying about this game were the controls.  Most games I play have the A and X buttons for punching and kicking.  This had B and Y. Also, you must press the right joystick in any direction to toggle between first person mode.  Isn't it a waste of a joystick to use it as a toggle button.  To look around in first person mode, you must go back to the left joystick.  Also, you cannot move your character in first person mode.  I needed to move slightly sideways to get someone in the crosshairs, but I had to go out of first person mode, move, then go back into first person mode. I also thought the "Fire" button was not very intuitive.  Additionally, when you are playing Ghost in the driving mode, you only have to worry about three controls.  That being the case, they still decided to change what you use as the "Fire" button.  Why not keep it consistent with what was used in the non-driving modes? I like games that help you escape into the world of the game.  I don't like to feel like I am playing a monotonous arcade game.  With "Enter the Matrix", I felt like I was playing an arcade game.  At one point, you couldn't drive through the wooden gate arms at a toll booth.  Instead, the game told you to survive for 2 minutes, then the gates would open.  Oh yeah, I could see that happening in the movie.  Yeah, right. I did like the "Focus" feature which allowed you to go into "Bullet time." ...	-1
Enter the Matrix is based on the new Matrix: Reloaded movie featuring matrix quality game-play, two person selection, clean crisp graphics, great sound track and sounds, amazing storyline, hacking option, and more, running at around 60fps, this game truly rocks. No game beats it. Especially on XBOX. I truly recommend this for any matrix fan.* :)	1
I'm amazed about how good Enter the Matrix turned out, this game has everything - bullet time, incredible Kung Fu directed by the Matrix fight scene choreographer with over 4000 moves, insane car chases and stunts and guns, lots of guns! Obviously I don't want to go too deep into the storyline, it's up to you to discover it for yourself but needless to say there are many merciless agents to be capped, dangerous yet crucial missions to complete and mind-blowing mysteries to be solved. You take control of either Niobe the pilot or Ghost, the zen-buddhist assassin in your extraordinary and life-changing quest. Neo, Trinity and Morpheus turn up regularly throughout the game to give you advice and help you out if you get into sticky situations! The graphics look absolutely stunning, and let's face it; if they were anything less than superb then the games desingers would have let themselves down. The Matrix, is a legacy that relies heavily on its amazing special effects and the game captures all the atmosphere and imagination that appears in the films. Further to this the sounds are absolutely brilliant. The charcters voices match those of their 'real-world' counterparts and the musical score has clearly been painstakingly thought-out to provide an absorbing experience. So the does the game live up to the hype? You bet it does. Not only is it a damn fine game on its own but playing and completing it reveals a section of the story that non-gamers will never see.	1
I really enjoyed playing this game, but it's not my favorite, they could have done a lot to make it better. First of all, it's to dark and colorless, they could have added a 2-player mode where you go through the story with both characters. When you see a agent you really do want to run! because they look so realistic. The graphics a really nicely done, games went up a point in graphic technology. If you haven't played the game you haven't seen the whole movie, when Niobie walks OUT of a room in the movie, she walks IN to the game. The game is based on Niobie and Ghost, and what they where doing through the movie that you didn't get to see. But hey! now we know why you don't get to play as Neo or Trinity... They where too busy smooching in the elivator to take part in the game... Personally I didn't care for the romance at all in the movie, the Matrix does NOT seem like that type of film at all. I really hope they cut it down in the 3rd movie. One more thing I hope they do, is make another game based on the first film so you can play as Neo and Trinity. But they already named the game "Enter the Matrix" instead of "Reloaded" so I don't know what they will do for a title. I still give it 5 stars because I had a fun time with it, and the movie 4 stars.	1
Enough said, I have an 11yr old and a 5yr old who can't stop playing on GameBoy.  Need I say more.  The price of this unit is great, but the games are like $30 bucks each, WOW!!!!  After you purchase 3 games you have exceeded what it cost to purchase this item, but oh well that's the price you pay for supply and demand I guess.  I am just frugle when it comes to purchasing games.	1
The plot is of the "wake up in a car on an empty road with no idea of where you are" variety. You stumble upon a gas station/motel/lodge and notice empty cars still running, tables knocked over, and eventually a very scared man locked in his office. You must then proceed to do the typical adventure game thing ... read notes and collect items to put the mystery together. The game is meant to be spooky, and it does cast an eerie atmosphere over the player - but don't expect to be truly terrified by any stretch.  In the vein of the Dark Fall series, this one succeeds in presenting puzzles and inventory quests that blend perfectly with the environment and the location of the story. There aren't any goofy "tape the cell phone to the cat and feed it salt-laced pizza to make it go into the next room for water and thusly overhear the conversation" type malarky. I was able to complete very nearly the entire game without consulting a walkthrough. Only near the end did I need to make a quick consultation to find one hotspot I had missed.  The other thing the game succeeds in is mood. No, it isn't Silent Hill level scary, or Resident Evil level jumpy ... but it does still cast an eerie mood. I love the integration of the nearby radio station that you can access in several areas - gives the opening chapters of the game a feeling reminiscent of John Carpenter's classic THE FOG.  My only reservations were the sheer number of dead ends. This is a slide-show type game where you click from one still pre-rendered scene to the next ... and there are A LOT of these screens - and A LOT of them lead you nowhere - you will zoom in and pick up items without collecting them, scratching your head wondering what the significance is, only to find out in the end that many of these objects are just there to be picked up and looked at. I suppose this was an effort to throw a little extra challenge into what was otherwise a short and simple game.  The only other gripe is that the menu bars are set to pop-up whenever you scroll near the top or bottom of the screen, which means any time you are exploring a scene and get too close to either extreme, the menus pop up. It's a small gripe, but one that I really started to notice near the end as I was trying to quickly wrap things up.  But, minor quibbles aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and plan to play it again in a few years when my memory has faded a bit! If you like adventure games at all, then give this one a try!	1
I've owned this game for awhile now. The first time I played it, it was only so-so. But now other times I really enjoy it.  As with most Johnathan Boakes games, the voice acting is not stellar but uite decent. The scenery is as well. Boakes likes to focus on creepy scenery.  With games by Johnathan Boakes, you have to take on the roll of your character. The character is usually you anyways, so it shouldn't be to hard.  Again, as is usual with Boakes games, these is a touch of cheesiness. Like a rock that appears everywhere to GET YOU!! But who doesn't mind a little cheese with their food?  Definiately not Boakes' best game, but a nie one to pass the time with.	1
"Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle" is an adventure/suspense/horror game that use Celtic legends to create a creepy atmosphere.  It has a lot of pros, but it has some cons, as well.  I am going to break down the game into several parts to explain it.  Story-You are driving along the British countryside, when your car suddenly dies.  You are unable to go back the way you came because of a force field (I'm not kidding) so you head forward  to explore around the area.  You eventually find out that a recent archaeological dig has upset some rocks, and they have come alive and attacked people (that is not a spoiler).  So, basically you're goal is to appease the rocks and put them back to "sleep".  Gameplay-This is a simple, first-person, point and click adventure game.  It's puzzles can get a little difficult, but they can mostly be solved quickly.  There are a few startling scenes in the game, but they aren't horrifying, and wile you can die in the game, you come right back to life to the location right before you died.  Basically, the premise of the game is to explore the area collecting items and information in order to find out how to appease the rocks.  Graphics-The backgrounds are nice, but this is a very dark game.  Most of it requires the use of a lantern, which allows you see only a tiny circle at a time, and this makes it hard to look around for items and paths.  The characters in this game aren't that great looking, the look like fake 3D characters.  Sound-There is little to no music in this game, but when it comes on, it adds to the spooky atmosphere.  The voice acting is OK but not great.  The background sounds are pretty good, though.  Fun-This is a fun game, although it is extremely unrealistic.  The story is a bit cheesy, but I found that this made me enjoy the spookiness rather than freak out about it.  Length-The game isn't that long, maybe 10 hours?  It could have been a bit longer if they had added a few more puzzles, but it's an OK length.  Overall, this game is worth a play, although I must say once more that the story is extremely fake and cheesy.  It has its spooky moments and its fun and challenging puzzles which make this game a pretty good play.	1
<<<shiver>> this game oozes ambiance and immersion. Playing it with the lights off, by myself in the dark only made this game 10 times better. The story was smooth with logical puzzles. Free of role playing and combat (thank the gaming gods!) it is a mystery where one points and clicks, solving as they go. Part csi, part McGiver, it didn't tax my brain or force me into a walkthrough (aka: schizm, riven etc) I was able to sit for hours and be lost in the world of Barrow Hill. I must recommend this along with another fantastic game: Scratches!!  Both will blow your mind---if you let it.	1
This game became one of my favorite 'adventure games'.  I like to keep my reviews condensed.  It did run a little short, especially in comparison to Black Mirror.  It was spooky, but very good, and worth while. It is a short sweet game, somewhat like Dark Fall.  I do wonder why these games are getting short, and less cost-effective.   There should be not too much trouble playing it through, It may get a little tricky now and then, but fairly straight forward in a fitted space frame.  You will need very little help from internet sites like: Walkthrough, hintlines, and uhs.   I would fully recommend this game as a good run in the genre.  One of my favorites.	1
Or on any platform. When the MATRIX was released in 1999, it was such a big hit, it was unbelievable. We all know why. Enter the Matrix, finnally, a matrix video game to tag along with the release of the next matrix: reloaded! Of course any matrix fan will see the matrix: reloaded! Anyway, Enter the Matrix will feature matrix quality everything! Super Powerd Graphics, Amazing Audio, Vast game play, great story line, options, etc. It looks really cool. Matrix action, deep intuitive(but a bit odd)storyline, will [certainly] keep your pants on! And boy, I can't wait to perform those slow motion matrix action bullet-time special stunts! I mean, come on? This is the matrix here! This is going to be awesome without a doubt. I just hope you can handle the hype! I recommend this for any matrix fan! :)	1
Much better then the Game Boy Advance, and better then the DS I think, and theres still alot of good games out for it, so my advice is to get it.	1
Why would you buy this now? It was really cool a couple of years ago but you should buy a Nintendo DS. It will play all the GBA games plus the DS games for only a little bit more. They've already stopped making games for this system. After Christmas I highly doubt they'll even have games available anymore. Get a DS. Just trying to be a buddy and help.	1
Whoa, where in bloody chickens did this game come from?  Underneath my gamer radar,  I did not consider Freedom Fighters warranting much attention, but once it stocked on the shelves, gamers began to ramble about it.  "Wow, this game's friggin' amazing!"  They hollered.  Like a wave of contagious infection, others followed, "amazing, amazing, amazing!"  The curious George within overran me and I decided to rent it, and what did I discover?  THIS GAME IS FRIGGIN' AMAZING!  I know why Freedom Fighters is on the tip of many gamers' tongues.  Squad-base action hasn't triumphed or felt this refreshing since tackling Ghost Recon.  But then again, even Ghost Recon did not invoke as much overwhelming guns-a-blazing, Rambo wallop.  Nor did Tom Clancy's romp take you in the streets and alleys of war-torn New York to gun down the blasted Reds! Communist Reds?  Aren't they gone?  Truthfully who knows (I watch too much X-Files), but in the fictional game of Freedom Fighters, the setting is based on an altered history.  Mother Russia is the triumphant of WWII, nuking Washington D.C., and subsequently invading Manhattan!  Jeez Louise, that's one helluva story, bub.  To make matters worse, Americans have to rely on some plumber to throw back the Communists invaders.  A plumber?  Not some Hu-Ra Marine or Ranger?  Nope, our heroic leading role, Chris Stone, must recruit soldiers to ultimately drive the threat back.  Hu-Ra, plumber Chris! Know this.  Everything Freedom Fighters happens to be is the direct reflection of excellent gameplay.  The concept, the system, and overall execution falls nearly flawless.  On the whole scale, FF rips up the genre into something that has been lacking entirely on today`s market.  EA has done good, real good.  The game is mission-based where few objectives must be carried out and the main one  is bringing down the Soviet Flag and hoisting the red, white, and blue.  Other goals include demolishing bridges with C4 and rescuing battered POWs.  Although the heart of the gameplay is focused on the firefighting.  It is a mix of first person and third person gunplay.  With automatic aiming in the third person and manual targeting with the first person, FF works perfectly.  Moving Chris is easy and somewhat cheap since you can see everything by rotating the camera in any direction you desire.  That may steal the suspense of not knowing where your enemies lie.  Relatively simple to handle, the combatants under your control work easier than you can imagine.  Directed by three buttons which hold a position, advance, and regroup, your recruits are very, very responsive. You can take up as many as twelve and gain them by accomplishing missions or sacrifices your health packs on wounded combatants.  Thusly, you gain charismatic points to earn additional soldiers.  With a formidable squad in your command and Chris himself, firefights can get huge.  Sometimes I just watch my fighters advance through enemy fire and run the Soviets down.  As long as you have health packs, you're soldiers can be revived endlessly.  Other great gameplay moments are helicopters chasing your party, trying to gun them to shreds, snipers taking accurate shots as you move through the streets, and the enemy outnumbering you as you retreat for cover.  And did I mention there's one surprising moment of a tank thundering into your position?  Great stuff, man. Sadly, with the good must come the bad.  FF is an all too brief game.  If you consider yourself the fanatic, all-day player, you may  conquer the game in one sitting.  Yes, it is that addictive, but don't be surprise to find yourself playing and playing, and suddenly reach the abrupt ending.  It happened to me the third day.  The second and last drawback I had was the automatic reloading.  I don't like it, it feels as I'm being spoon-fed. I mean imagine if Halo were like that?  It wouldn't be as deep, and I believe the intensity of  FF could have been so much more without it.  I want to be the dictator of all my actions and be forced to retreat, run for cover, and reload properly! Graphically, Freedom Fighters is sharp and distinctively stands on its own.  The layout of the environment has captured a remarkable setting of what New York were to look if a battleground.  Set in the cool urban terrain, the added touches of the soviet's barricades and defensive lines augment the powerful setting.  The incredible atmosphere grips the dark and harsh event of war in the city.  Seeing the somber soldiers in their palpable gloom, holding their firearms reached a degree of melancholy.  Enemy structures as turrets, barb wire, and small towers were stirring to see as flashy firefights break out and my soldiers cleared out enemy positions.  It's always pleasant to watch the reds go into your blast of a frag or shot gun, and see them hurled across the screen.  The faces on each character are tremendously in depth, with superior frame rate to back it up.  Chris intends to change outfits in accordance with his mood, and his mug is awesome when he wore a hood and covered his face during the lone sniper mission.  It was amazing to watch him with an AK-47 strapped to his back, climbing up the ladder as lighting struck. On the music FF is like a gun, it goes off with a blast.  Collected in a well developed variety of music, it's a treat to listen to many different themes.  The Russian opera is often played and never ceases to amaze me.  There are different types of music played at the right time such as heated firefighting.  The soft, congratulating music played after a mission is also one of the best pieces the game delivers.  It is a feeling of heroism springing into the air.  Voiceovers are done excellently.  Chris is gruff and speaks only when necessary, so when he actually does, you can expect something completely impressing.  Sound effects themselves are booming with great sound design.  The cool Russian accents are rife with authority and seem truly authentic. Take my word, Freedom Fighters is well worth the purchase.  It's a mouthful of joy and goes to hit its stride in the genre.  The polish of the game is obviously done where it counts, stellar high action.  One remarkable game, you can't be steered wrong with it.	1
This game has intensity. It grabs you from the moment you start playing and immerses you into a world where urban terror reigns - a frightfully realistic scenario. The gameplay in this game is unmatched by any game that I have played, allowing the player to become totally involved with the action and commanding his fellow recruits. The graphics are exceptionally well designed, the music and voice tones are chillingly appropriate and the depiction of the environment is superb. Well done IO, I can't wait for Hitman 3.	1
This one is a dark horse surprise.  I had not heard much about this game until the day it came out and received some impressive ratings.  So I picked it up on a whim, and I cannot put it down. The controls take a little while to get used to, much like GTA, but once you do its fine.  The graphics are ok, not great.  But the game is fun enough to overtake that.  It is very difficult in spots, although a different strategy or route is usually available to avoid the difficult areas.  Course, I usually don't figure that out until I've spent an hour trying to make it through an area.  The story has a nice mix of corniness and dark ambience.  It like the cut-scene crew wasn't really in tune with the gameplay developers. My one knock on the team control is that it is very difficult to assign any one particular team member to one location.  Because they all carry different guns, sometimes you want the guy with the AK to guard a spot.  That is difficult to do.  However, it never was much of a problem. The team interaction is nearly flawless.  Sometimes the A.I. is too aggressive and team members will run out and get shot up before you are ready to attack, but overall it is well done.  That's good because your team does the vast majority of the fighting late in the game. The only bad thing is I find myself AT WORK thinking about this game or planning strategies to move past a level or obstacle.  Not good for concentration.	1
First i have to indicate that i haven't played the Full game yet , i have only played the Demo and have read many official and non official reviews for this game . The story is about the Alter story of our Recent History , the Russians have bombed their first Nuke Bomb on berlin at 1945 and won the war , and not only this but all Europe has become their Property , and now the US is the only country that is still not under the Control of the Communies . You play as Chris Stone , an ordinary guy who works as a plumber , one day he is fixing some Customer's shower and then the invasion begins , you are instantly trhown into the living hell of modern day Manhattan with only some Plumber's tools and you are required to make your own path , after that you are trying to form the first cell of the resistance against the Russians , you wander through the city and try to recruit the ordinary citizens of the city to join your resistance group , but the task is hard at first , but as the game continues and with every mission you complete and with every operation you succeed you gain extra points of Charisma which helps you to recruit more and more fighters , in order to liberate the city from the Russians . The gameplay is extrelmly fluid and easy , the past complications of the same genre games (Advenature/Strategy)is something out of the past , with a very easy contolable movements , the game becomes very easy to control which is something very great for this kind of games , the only control problem here is the Inventory Control which is very hard and can make you exposed to the fire during the battles while you are trying to switch the weapon . Freedom Fighters is a very welcomed addition to the world of Gaming , and very very Addictive game which is impossible to put down , and shamely it hasn't got the Reception it deserves in the US , it really deserves more attention and more sales .	1
Freedom Fighters is a surprise hit of the fall.  Freedom Fighters is one of the best games I own, and one of the most interesting.  The concept of the game sounds pretty stupid, but it is actually probably the best concept a game could have.  The whole idea of the game is the Soviet Union won the Cold War and now in the year 2001 the Soviets take over New York.  You play as a character named Christopher Stone.  He is a normal New Yorker making a living as a plumber.  One day on the job all hell breaks loose when the Commies suddenly appear in NY and start taking over.  As the game progresses, Chris goes from a standard blue-collar worker to leader of the resistance known as Freedom Fighters. FF combines a lot of good ideas in one game.  The game is a mixture of action, stealth, turn-based strategy, and a little bit of problem solving.  In order to continue in the game, you have to complete missions and errands for the resistance, like blowing up Soviet buildings, freeing prisoners, transporting supplies, and rescuing other freedom fighters.  Fear not though, because you will have help.  Almost any freedom fighter can be recruited to follow you; all you have to do is walk up to them and hit X.  In order to recruit more people, your Charisma points have to be up.  What that means is you have to do good deeds to get more fighters; you can have up to 12.  You can order your recruits to do almost anything, like defend an area, follow you, or attack a certain enemy.  The Multiplayer for FF is pretty good but it isn't the best.  Throughout the game you will be able to use a fairly good variety of weapons like a pistol, a shotgun, an Assault rifle, a sniper rifle, and the resistance loving Molotov cocktail.  The graphics for FF are very good, especially the environment.  The controls for FF are  easy to learn and don't give you any problem.  Freedom Fighters does have a small number of flaws though. One, the camera angle can get you screwed when you are in close quarters, Two, why does it take 10 assault rifle shots to kill the enemy, and why does it tend to take 2 shots in the head to kill them? Three, the game can get fairly hard and occasionally will get you frustrated.  In the end, though, Freedom Fighters is a great game, and no true PS2 gamer should miss out on this game.	1
This is a great game that kept me on the edge of my seat great graphics all around spooky game.	1
I've played Myst games and Scratches, and although the first 2 Myst games were without the 360degrees turn, Myst 3 and 4 had 360 degree turn in the game.  The reason the first 2 Myst games did not have 360 turn was that they came out in the early 1990's.  This game did not have that, and I was expecting it to have it, mainly because its a recently new game that probably came out last year or so.  Another thing is I just didn't care for this so I returned it for a refund.  Sorry to be the only one here who didn't pick up interest in this one.	-1
This game reminds me of those really bad survival horror playstation games. I say this because everything you do has to be precise. For example: You see a door and you can't open it. So you have to search high and low for a rubber band to place it on the doorknob. Still can't open the door, so you have to search high and low for something with substantial weight to balance on the rubber band, so that the rubber band can swing low turning the doorknob opening the door. Couldn't you just turn the doorknob with your hands? This example didn't come from this game, but it's similar stuff like. You can't do things without finding other stuff first. This can be long and frustrating... yet addicting if you're stubborn.  I wish you could do more than just point-and-click. The game is a bit eerie and at times I thought I was going to jump out my seat, but knowing all you could do is just point-and-click really takes away the excitement. There's no way you can go to combat with your fancy point-and-click trick. No no.. it's way too fancy. A lot of the times I wasn't sure when was the right moment to click. The arrow of your mouse will turn into either a direction (left, right, or up) or a magnifying glass telling you that you can zoom either in or out. But you'd have to place your arrow directly over an item, and it's hard to identify interacting objects because they were random, at least in my opinion. My roommate thinks differently. You'd look at a table with a bunch of boxes on it, and you suspect there's something in there, you move your mouse the box on the left but your arrow doesn't change into the magnifying glass, nor does it change for the box on the right, but sure enough it changes for the box huddled inbetween a broken couch and empty bottles. And you'd have to be careful not to move the arrow so far up or down on the screen because black margin's will show up (containing objects you've picked up and can use).  I did enjoy having to find scraps of paper in various locations especially if they hold important information. My roommate hated this because that meant you had to read everything... and there was A LOT to read. But it made me feel like a real detective. My advice: make notes on everything you think is important. Just so you don't have to kill yourself trying to find that one scrap of paper in that abandoned and random place to figure out the combination of the lock to a room you need to go in.  I give this game a 3.5 because of the reasons I've mentioned. Having a battle would be fun, and only if it wasn't so random. But it did keep me going-- I am a bit stubborn to figure things out so I was always on my computer. I'd play it again in a year or so, just so I can forget the step-by-step process and start anew.	1
Atmospheric and spooky, at least at first.  I like this kind of game, but found that I certainly didn't have to try very hard to uncover clues and solve mini puzzles even before the real mystery presented itself!  Before I knew it, half the game was solved with very little effort.  I thought the story and setting were intriguing, though the ending was a bit abrupt and unsatisfying.  I enjoy a good lengthy hunt, so was basically disappointed with the ease I was able to piece together the overall "mystery" and solve it.  This may have something to do with the small area avaialable to search since the entire setting is fairly confined.  Though I rarely judge a game by its length alone, I must say that just as I was starting to get interested in the mystery and characters, it was over- I honestly couldn't believe it.  Some of the inventory items weren't even necessary to finding the intended clue!  I'm not completely disappointed, but think I'll just pass this on to my ten year old who may have more fun with it.	-1
I have to say that I watched the development of this game before Matt Clark went 'public' and out of the 'independent game' category. I'm actually one of the 1st 100 people who ordered it.  I was NOT EVEN REMOTELY disappointed!!!!  HURRAY.  I'm only sorry that I'm so late in posting my review here, because Mr. Clark has done such a wonderful job!  I admit to having a real weakness for adventure games of the Celtic/mystery supernatural gendre, so I'm real picky.  I was NOT disappointed - even slightly!  Even from the beginning, the game doesn't let up, and at all points, it is appropiately spooky. It's night, after all, so everything is dark.  The parts that are in the "present" seem like islands in a much larger scheme of things.  Yours to discover how and why.  The whole game fits together PERFECTLY - and as I've said, I'm real picky!  Mr. Clark, I continue to play your wonderful game, and I'm so proud that my vigilance paid off.  It's a play again - over and over.  How many games does one play about which that can be said?!  If you love Celtic myth and mystery as much as I do - BUY IT!!!!!  BTaylor	1
i got this for christmas about 2 1/2 years ago and it still works like new this is a great sytem you will love it is a good gift for anybody and there is and almost endless posobility of good game choices and it plays both gamboy color and game boy advance games overalll the sp deserves 5 stars	1
A barrow is an ancient burial ground, often in the form of mounds of earth or with standing stones such as Stonehenge. England is dotted with these ancient sites, labeled as "tumuli" on maps. In 18th century England, digging up barrows was a favorite hobby of the educated, resulting in damage of the sites.  Cornwall, the southwestern tip of England, has a rich history of barrows. In Barrow Hill, a team of archaeologists is proceeding on a dig of the local barrow that features seven mysterious stones. The barrow has been left undisturbed except for the building of a service station and motel nearby, but once the team begins excavating, an ancient evil is unleashed on the land.  The barrow in the game is based on Looe, Cornwall, and features parallel structures such as an ancient pagan well, barrow, swamp and service station.  Creator Matt Clark has put a phenomenal amount of time and energy into doing justice to the barrows and Cornish legends, and as a bonus there is a link to a webpage talking about the history of Cornwall, barrows, and the making of the game (I was expecting something more polished from the blurb on the back of the box). Clark was aided on Barrow Hill by horror master Jonathan Boakes, creator of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dark-Fall-The-Journal/dp/B0000A341P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dark Fall: The Journal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dark-Fall-Lights-Out/dp/B0002BID5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dark Fall: Lights Out</a>.  I had difficulties installing this on my Windows XP laptop; I had to try four or five times, as each time I would begin to install, the installer would launch another copy and freeze completely. My perseverance finally paid off, though, and once I'd launched the game, I didn't encounter any bugs, crashes, or freezes.  The game begins with a grainy black-and-white film of you driving along the Cornish country roads as night begins to fall. There is a sense of dread as local radio personality Emma Harry talks about the onset of the Autumn Equinox, and dark clouds race ominously across the sky. Suddenly, your car goes dead, and you're stranded in the middle of a dark forest. But are you alone? There are strange rustles and cries from the bushes, and you're certain that something's watching...  Barrow Hill is a first-person slideshow similar to Myst in format. You advance one screen at a time (no 360-degree panning here), which can be terrifying when you're crashing through the undergrowth with only a weak battery flashlight to light the darkness. The photorealistic graphics are based on thousands of pictures of the Cornish countryside. The architecture of the few featured buildings shines, from the ruins of an ancient chapel to the worn-down service station. Little touches make each screen come to life, and there are innumerable close-ups of objects just for exploration's sake (which can be confusing at first trying to determine if it's a hotspot or not). Also like Myst, you'll soon discover that Barrow Hill is devoid of people other than yourself and one or two secondary characters that you interact with only briefly. Where has everyone gone? What happened to the archaeological team? Why are there idling cars with no occupants?  The sound deserves special mention, as thousands of ambient sounds were recorded in Cornwall to add to the authenticity, including the chirp of the Cornish cricket. The soundtrack is sparse but effective, underscoring moments of danger or discovery. Voice acting is satisfactory, if a bit melodramatic at times.  On your quest, you're aided by several high-tech gadgets, including a cell phone, PDA, GPS, and a metal detector. All of these tools play a part in your quest to restore balance to the barrow. There are plenty of well-scattered clues to the nature of your task, informative background reading in the form of pamphlets, diaries, and mock websites, and many locations to explore.  The puzzles are inventory-based and generally intuitive. You pick up only what you need to aid you on your quest, and once you've used it, it disappears from inventory. The journals and gadgets left behind by the team give you plenty of fodder to consider your next move. You can die, and if you do, you're placed one step before your fatal mishap.  The biggest achievement after the outstanding sound and graphics is the immersive atmosphere of utter dread...although not gory, you constantly feel hunted by the sense that something evil is looking over your shoulder, from creepy voices on disconnected telephones to ominous smoldering piles of ash next to idled vehicles, or the crash of something following you in the pitch-black woods. My only disappointment was in the super-brief ending that didn't seem to resolve much of the detailed storyline that had unfolded throughout the game, but in Barrow Hill it's the journey, not the destination, that counts.	1
I'm always on the lookout for an excellent paranormal or Fortean type game.  When I saw this one, and read the reviews, I gave it a chance.  I wasn't disappointed.  Beautiful graphics, eerie atmosphere and an engaging story all make it worth playing.  My only complaint about it is the length.  It's too short.  Can't recall how long it took, but I would guess around 2 hours or so to finish.  Maybe less.  Still, the game is well worth having if you want a good eerie title for your collection.  It isn't scary, and though some say you can die, I never did.  If you get the walkthrough for it from GameFAQs, you'll complete the game in now time.	1
You see yourself inside a city with no exit. You can't get out and everybody is gone. You have to solve the mistery of the Curse to get out. I liked it. It was fun. You read very little information and have to figure out the puzzles almost by yourself. But it's not difficult and you have clues all over the place. I really enjoyed the story and it's not an action game. It's plain mistery up to the last minute. You have an idea what's going on by reading some information but the doubt is on your mind all the time. It's not a long game, but it's fun.	1
I thought this was a good game. These days, any adventure game with reasonable puzzles and appropriate length automatically deserve praise in my book. There is nothing worse than a long game with ill designed puzzles/fights to turn this player off (are you there Call of Chthulu?). Barrow has decent graphics, a spooky atmosphere, well designed locations and a gripping plot. The ending may have been better but this one still stands above the crowd (also recommended: scratches). Looking forward to play Boakes' games next, also on the pad: the black mirror and its follow-up nibirus. Hopefully they will be as good as the Barrow.	1
With Sony's PSP and Nintendo's own new portable, the DS, the days of the incredibly long running GameBoy are coming to an end.  With the SP, the fifth incarnation of Nintendo's classic portable gaming machine, gamers finally got a backlit screen and a rechargable battery pack, two additions which make this the best GameBoy system ever (and yes, it's still better than the recently released GameBoy Micro), and yes, not only does it play GBA titles, it also plays the old GameBoy and GameBoy Color cartridges as well.  Not to mention that there's a ton of classic Super NES ritles that have been ported to the GBA as well.  That feature also helps make the SP the absolute best GameBoy system ever, since the Micro and the DS aren't compatable with them.  With all that, there is an absolutely huge library of games to choose from, and since it's from Nintendo, there's naturally a large library of quality first party games.  I'd take this over a PSP any day of the week because the SP proves that it's the games, not the features, that make a portable system worth owning.  There's a ton of essential original GameBoy and GameBoy Color games that are worth owning (including the Super Mario Land series, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, Metroid 2: Return of Samus, Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, and Metal Gear Solid), and below is a list of the best GBA games that are essential for every SP owner:  Super Mario Bros. Advance 1, 2, 3, & 4  Mario Kart Super Circuit  Doom 2  Castlevania: Circle of the Moon  Street Fighter Alpha 3  Phantasy Star Collection  Golden Sun  Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past  Metroid Fusion  Gunstar Super Heroes  Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace  Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap  Advance Wars 2  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2  Contra Advance: The Alien Wars  Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo Revival	1
The Gameboy Advance debuted in 2001, and was an astonishing system to behold.  It was like carrying around a Super Nintendo, and it gave old school gamers a chance to enjoy the 16 bit era all over again!  The problem with the regular Gameboy Advance is the screen wasn't backlit and buying batteries over and over again was a pain.  In 2003 the first Gameboy Advance SP came around, and it was one of the few times when I simply didn't think about buying a reissued system, I simply did it.  It had a backlit screen, a rechargable battery and an LCD fold down screen.  Now I could truly say I was carrying around a handheld console.  There was nothing to be concerned about with the Gameboy Advance SP.  A long lasting battery plus a backlit screen, and being an old school gamer who absolutely loved the 16-bit era.  The Gameboy Advance SP simply was carrying around a piece of heaven.  Now we have another GBA SP, with a stronger backlight.  It is a lot brighter (with the battery being about the same), and the cover is shiny, but that doesn't really make it worth the buy.  It's great that unlike the Nintendo DS, you can play regular Gameboy games and Gameboy Color games, and the backlight actually makes the graphical output of the game better, but I simply can't help but admit that aside from this neat tweak, it's exactly the same as the original SP.  Simply put, if you've already got a GBA SP, you probably won't need the newer ones.  They're better than the GBA Micro, and they're easy to carry around, but a brighter backlit screen doesn't really warrant it a buy, unless it's really cheap.  The other thing that hurts the GBA is simple: Gaming is propelling forward.  The GBA's moment of sunshine is basically over.  As much as I hate to admit that, it is.  The handheld war is now between the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP.  Even so, if you've got the system just for Gameboy Advance games, the Nintendo DS is probably a better way to go.  It is still a good system (why on earth would you compare this to the PSP?), but it's time to shine is coming to an end.  Fantastic system, and I love living the 16-Bit era again, but it's not too worthwhile if you've already got a GBA SP to begin with.  However, what garners this the four it so rightly deserved is simple.  If you don't have a Gameboy Advance this is undoutebly the best one to go with.  A fold down LCD screen means less scratches, the backlight is fantastic, and the games are just all around good games.  In short...  The Good  +It's still a classic system  +A Super Nintendo in your pocket  +Plays regular Gameboy games and Gameboy Color games (unlike the Micro and DS)  +Excellent presentation of the games  +Fold down LCD screen  +The backlit screen really brings out the best in the GBA's graphics, and it's more vibrant and colorful  +Don't have a GBA?  This is the best one to go with  The Bad  -If you've already got the regular Gameboy Advance SP, it might not be worth getting this simply for a brighter backlit screen  -The Handheld Console war has moved on to the Nintendo DS and the PSP, if you're a gamer that simply must keep up with the times, this isn't for you	1
Finally, there happens to be a video game system that can have the feeling of success of all gamers alike, with the femine feeling of a pink color. That has been something many companies never thought would ever happen by a longshot. That is the case with Nintendo. Since they came up with the idea of colorizing and personalizing their Game Boy systems back in the 1990's, many companies haven't caught on to the handheld success and unique distinction. While so many might've considered white, black and grey, nobody would ever believe it at all, at last a pink Game Boy.  Nintendo Game Boy Advance in Pearl Pink is a convient video game handheld that appeals to all gamers alike, men and women. This handheld is sleek and convient that you can take it anywhere. You also have the ability to play Game Boy Advance games like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest, Warioware: Twisted, and so many other great Game Boy Advance titles out there. You also have the backwards compatability on this system of earlier Game Boy titles from the Game Boy Color, and the original Game Boy era, going all the way back to the late 1980's. The gameplay is fun and still distinctive to its constant appeal, and the price fits for all consumers who have a distinction for a video game system to call their own.  While so many might be interested in other systems like the Xbox 360, Sony's upcoming Playstation 3, or anything else, the Game Boy Advance from Nintendo is a delightful joy for anybody who wants classic video gaming, at a affordable price of fun.  Gameplay: A  Sound: A+  Price: A+  Backwards Compatability: A 1/2+  Overall: A 1/2+	1
I have 3 SPs (one of them is broken), the latest one I got last October with new backlit screen, the brightness and color is a lot better, but there's also a tradeoff: you can't play it under direct sunlight  even with different screen, SP still has 100% legacy support (can play a lot of legacy GB/GBC games without problem)  also, flip design is the best way to protect screen from scratching or damage  though it's highly rated, there're some minor flaw:  1. headphone jack is same as DC in jack, you need to buy plug adaptor  2. battery, though the battery is removable, the door is not getting opened easily, you need a little philips screw driver to open, actually, SP is not DS, the data, clock, and setting will not erased when the battery is removed, nintendo should change the battery door design, that can be opened easily  3. AC adaptor, this AC adaptor should be auto-volt, which can be used internationally  4. LCD, though it looks a lot brighter and better color, it's not viewable outdoors like old SP and DS, a transflective screen is a good balance between color and outdoor visibility  conclusion: get SP is you have some legacy GB/GBC games	1
classic, very cool game with lots to do and big maps, its always fun, but that being said this is TOTAL PROPGANDA, just keep that in mind	1
One my Favorite PS2 Game	1
Great story line, Good controls. Lots of action. I love it. Keeps me busy for hours. Being disabled this helps.	1
This game has a great plot, with reversed major historical events and multi-player is great with 4 controllers and at least a 32" LCD/LED/Plasma etc etc (Plasma T.V. Owners Note: don't leave any static image on a Plasma type T.V., as it may burn into the screen with sometimes permanent damage and ghosted images).	1
This game is so fun! it has so many great qualities, and only a few bad ones. The storyline to this is basicly where russia invades america, and you take the role of a plumber who fights on count of his brother being kidnapped by the soviets. This game is fairly challenging as you go up the difficulty bar, and i always have a good time playing it every time i put it in the ps2. This game was made in 2003, and i find it to be one of the best games i've palyed to date of 2012.  the good things:  * This game is extremly fun, and goes where not many games, books, or movies will go. An invasion of America. Main reason for that is because who ever the "invader" in the story is, takes legal matters in reallity.  * The weapon system is pretty cool, you don't reload whenever you want because your character will automaticly reload when you quit firing. weapons in the game are pretty limited, and ammo is harder to find for some then others. You can use an ak-47, smg, shotgun, pistol, revolver, sniper rifle, heavy machine gun, molotove cocktail, grenade, rocket launcer, and the insanley random wrench (yes i know your a plumber in the game and it goes in context with your character, but there could be so many better things to use)  * The game has a rag-doll system, that's where you can shoot someone with a shotgun and they fly across the room, then do it to another guy and they'll fly a completly diffrent way then the last one did. This oddly enough makes the game more funny and entertaining and gives it a little replay value.  * Levels in the game can be travelled in more then just one way, and this gives it a more stratigic feeling. Also you can sort of control a squad though it's not very interactive. You can tell them to attck, defend, or follow/retreat. Since you can't pick who you order to do what, and their weapon is random, your plans don't go the exact way you want (you don't want someone with a pistol giving you covering fire from 5 russians).  the bad stuff:  * The game is extremly fun, but fairly short. I can beat it twice in one day easy enough. It gives you a chapter (month) and so many missions (2-4) in every chapter (i think there are only 4 or 5 chapters). Missions usually take 5 to 10 minutes, but get easier as you get used to the games style.  * (this is for the control freaks) if you like having your ammo perfectly proportioned, get ready for a meltdown  * Every chapter you change outfits, and some of them are really cool, but you can only wear them through that chapter and not the entire game  * You'll find yourself tearing your hair out by how many times you here your character giving orders, every few seconds it's either "attack" "move out" "fall back" or the infamous "on me"  All in all, this game is extremly fun, and i'd recommend it to anyone. the game does have it's down sides, but they are greatly out matched by the up sides. I love this game and it's got a permanent spot in my top 5 games.	1
Conrad Morse, a noted Archaeologist, has received permission to excavate the mound at Barrow Hill, a site in Cornwall that has remained undisturbed since its construction in 2500 B.C.E., according to local legends. A mysterious force seems to surround the mound, as former attempts to survey the area have resulted in disapearances. Morse's excavations have drawn the interest of the press as well as aroused the ire of several conservation groups.  Matters seem about to come to a head, and on the night of the Autumn Equinox they do--but not in a way that any might have dreamed.  That night you--an unnamed character with an unspecified role--are driving down the Barrow Hill road listening to the radio when, shortly after sunset, your car stalls.  Behind you, some sort of forcefield prevents you from returning the way you came.  Your only choice is to go on, and in the process, solve the mystery of Barrow Hill.  Barrow Hill is a lovely 1st-person slideshow game in the style of the Dark Fall series (no wonder, as Jonathan Boakes and developer Matt Clark are sometime collaborators).  The action takes place in a relatively limited area, all in the course of a single night.  As your surroundings are mostly deserted, you have to rely on collecting inventory and clues to find out what has happened and heal the breach that is allowing a dark force to run ramampant in the area.  MOst of the puzzles involve accessing locked or blocked areas and putting together information.  Despite the dark subject matter and the literal darkness of the screen, I did not find this game quite as spooky as it might have been.  Some things startled me, but I never felt personally threatened.  Of course, I never encountered the large glowing stone that, by most accounts, is capable of bringing your explorations to an abrupt end.  I have heard that these encounters are the result of not having completed tasks in one area before going on to the next, so I think making a logical exploration of central areas before proceeding to peripheral ones may be a lifesaver in this game.  Sounds effect and music are understated.  Sometimes you'll hear a spooky chord that seems to herald a momentuous event, only to have nothing really happen. You hear quite a few birds, but don't see many.  Voice acting was quite good, however.  I especially enjoyed the many amusing commercials you could hear on various radio stations.  Collecting inventory was mainly easy, barring one or two pixel hunts and a few places where I had to get a hint because I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for.  Collating information was more complicated, partly because you could not keep the many documents you found during the course of the game.  This made taking voluminous notes a necessity.  Also, there were a number of red herrings:  notes that seemed to have no bearing on the case and items you could interact with that didn't have any purpose.  It was easy to get bogged down trying to do something with these items other than pick them up and put them down again. One puzzle seemed unnecessary, because by the time I solved it, I had already figured out what the clues it contained revealed.  I found the ending a little abrupt and disatisfying.  Once you solved the final puzzle, things happened very quickly.  There was not a lot of time to look around the last area you came to.  I also was left wondering about the connections between some of the elements;  I wasn't quite sure who were the good guys and who were the bad.  A cut scene at the end seemed sort of tacked on.  All in all, I enjoyed this game, which took me maybe 10 hours to complete.  It had a level of complexity in the puzzles which I have found lacking in many inventory-based games, and the plot line was engaging and well thought out.  My main critique is that I wuld have liked to have seen some of the elements developed more.  However, I look forward to more games from Matt Clark and company.	1
Me and my girlfriend spent all Sunday playing this game. We were hooked.  The Good.  Excellent graphics.  Good Story.  Fun to Play.  The Bad.  The Ending was weak.  The monster should have chased the character throughout the game. Only shows up twice.  Short game  Overall, not a bad way to spend a day. Better than Darkfall. If you want a Darker Myst type game with not as many puzzles, but more searching. This game should suit your tastes fine.............	1
I've had this system for more than 2 years now and I haven't had any problems period. You can take this anywhere you go and you won't need batteries (a huge relief). There is a battery inside the Gameboy, so you can just load it up. While playing at night you'll need a light. Well, there's a light inside the screen that you can turn off or on (without will save you battery life). So far I own 7 games and I still have fun playing them.  The Gameboy Advance SP is mainly for kids, seeing that there are alot of kiddie games for the system and it's definitely not breakable (unlike the PSP). It's also easy to get used to.  Overall, this is a system for kids and it's definitely worth it. It's even cheap nowadays, so buy it and you won't regret it!	1
A lot of times, when I get a new system, I will go on for a while picking up different games and playing through them and figuring out what I think about them, but many of them I will often wind up trading toward other games as I go along.  However, later on, I will often go back and recollect the ones I most enjoyed.  I just recently recollected this one for my Ps2 collection, having been one of my favorites on Ps2.  I have recollected a good chunk of others on Ps2 at this point as well, spare a few.  The only problem with this game is that sometimes it can tend to be a bit glitchy, but overall this was an awesome game!  If you have Ps2 or Xbox access, I recommend checking this game out if you have never played it...if you like adventure & shooters.  It was pretty cool, and the storyline is kind of a 'what if?' type of scenario...if America had been invaded by another country.  It's really a lot of fun, and if you want to have a little more fun with it too, there are some fun cheat codes for it.  Overall, very fun!	1
I hadn't heard about this game until I came across some online video showing the game play.  I ordered it that very same day.  I have always loved games where you have teammates supporting you and Freedom Fighters delivers that experience.  You take on the roll of a plumber in an alternate reality where the Soviet Union has been slowing taking over most of the world.  They invade your city and you're forced into becoming a guerrilla solider and ultimately the very face of the counter offensive.  The city and characters look good not great, but considering the number of guys fighting at once, the snow effects in some areas, and the draw distance, all with no slowdown at all the graphics are very impressive.  I did find it hard to tell friends from enemies at a distance.  Controls are tight and make use every button on the controller, including L3 and R3.  Command over your allies is pretty good, but you can only order them in sequence.  This can be annoying if you put a guy someplace strategic and then place the next guy at the wrong spot.  You have to issue your position orders all over again to get everybody in the right place.  Oh and yes you can invert the Y-axis or not, which is my biggest concern with this type of game.  Woo hoo!  During a level you're given one or more areas to visit to complete objectives which usually break down to free the prisoners, blow up an objective, or raise the flag over a building to capture it for your group.  In theory you can take them in multiple ways, but in practice if you don't complete the missions in specific order you're not going to be able to finish them.  Don't worry though, it's pretty easy to figure out the order and you're given hints.  The only level I looked to a guide for was an assignation level where you're on your own and you'll be playing the level over repeatedly if you don't know what to expect.  My only real gripe is with the length.  I've only been playing it a couple of days and I'm already over half done.  It think it'd be a fun game to replay, but it comes in on the low end of the amount of play time I expect out of a title.  The good news is that nowadays the price is really low so you can get it cheap and not really have to worry about how much length you're getting for your money.	1
At first glance, this game gave the impression that it would be a mindless shooter, but after watching a trailer on [...], the serious tone of the game grabbed my attention and I put it on my list of games to buy. I wonder what took me so long. Created by the developers of the Hitman series at IO Interactive, and with a music score produced by Jesper Kyd, players can rest assured that this game is not the cheap shooter that the cover and name suggests it is.  Imagine the world had Russia been the first to drop the Atomic Bomb and ended the Second World War. Imagine Russia's former Soviet Government now the planet's superpower and America's inferior position therein. As the Communist party builds in strength, consuming one small nation at a time, stretching its bloodthirsty tendrils closer and closer to home - you experience firsthand the demise of the free world, America being the final target.  New York City is invaded and America becomes occupied by the soviet regime. They control the news stations and try to instill in people's minds that they are undefeatable and attempt mass indoctrination of Communistic values.  You, Chris, were fortunate enough to find a member of the underground Warring Against Reds Resistant Movement in the middle of the invasion and are escorted to their hideout and military camp. There you are debriefed on how to weaken the Soviet hold of New York and are assigned missions by the head of the Warring Against Reds Movement herself. How you play the missions and in what order is up to you, but if certain strategic key hits are made on the enemy, you will find assaulting their main strongholds in New York a lot easier.  For example, prior to infiltrating a compound, it might be wise to destroy some of the bridges that connect with that part of town to stop the influx of enemy troops or destroy fueling stations and landing pads to further disrupt enemy reinforcement and supply. If you take this approach, you will find yourself jumping from one part of the city to another, using the sewers, in your attempt to weaken the enemy before delivering the final devastating blow. But before committing any action, you might want to gear-up by assaulting a Russian weapon Depot held within an abandoned city restaurant. So, this game has an element of strategy.  You can assault the Reds head on, or cut through city alleyways and flank their position. You can use trucks, or outside ventilation shafts to get inside buildings that can be used to pick off a couple of heads before telling your men (and women) to charge. Which brings me to the easy command system: for Playstation, Triangle is attack, Square is abort, and Circle is defend current position. There has been no easier way to command an army in a game. You can have a max of twelve freedom fighters join up with you, depending on your charisma (charisma is calculated by the amount of time you spend healing wounded civilians, rescuing POWs and blowing up enemy compounds).  My only complaint with this great game is that they should have spent more time with the development of the story. The Soviet conquest of America happened rather suddenly. I would think it would take a bit more than a day to completely take control of a country. They should have drawn out the invasion more so that the player can feel a real sense of loss, and perhaps feel more inspired to recapture what is ours during the fights. The game does do a good job at portraying America completely dominated by the foreigners, having all these Russian speakers on TV explaining the current events and the new system. The game is also way too short. After beating it, I got the impression that the creators, although innovative and talented, were rushed. Would love to see this story retold and this game remade under a more generous budget and time table.	1
Just about everything that freedom fighters does in does right. From the exciting story to the suberb gameplay and some of the best music to ever grace a game. First of all Freedom Fighters is underated and underappriciated. It didn't sell that well and that it a terrible shame because this is a game that should be experianced by all. I mean your hooked from the start and it just gets better and better. First of all the squad controls are excellant and easy to use no matter how many soldiers you have and eventually you'll have 12 soldiers under your command. Your squadmates are very intelligent, along with the enemy soldiers, exhibit some of the most impressive a.i. seen in game. The 3rd person shooting is handled well and the aiming system does take getting used to but eventually becomes simple enough. The graphics are very solid and the environments are all suberb and varied throughout the game. The character models are solid and the included ragdoll physics are again some of the best to grace a videogame. The weapon selection is a little lacking but not to big an issue. The music is absolutely suberb and always manages to keep you entralled in the game. From start to finish Freedom Fighters is a blast and easily one to keep playing. There is a multiplayer but it has only one mode that is fun but there simly needed to be more modes to play with. It sucks that it got low sales and that hurts the chances for a much needed sequel. But if ever a game deserved a sequel Freedom Fighters would be it. So if you have not played freedom fighters, do yourself a favor go pick it up, you won't regret, and hell it only costs like 10$ so what have you got to lose?	1
This game is so superbly done it outshines later hits as Resident Evil 4, any GTA permutation, even the hit squad based action FPS Brothers in Arms. I have played all of these games and I keep coming back to Freedom Fighters. What brings me back is the perfect tactical control.  The easy interface with your squad, the charisma meter, and the great story with excellent cutscenes with superb music make this a must own.	1
I just got a brand new GBA SP today, and you wouldnt believe how much better it is when compared to the older models! First of all, people have always said that the original GBA SP was back-lit, but that is in fact a false statement. The older GBA SP's weren't back-lit, they were side-lit, which means that light came out from the sides of the screen, and traveled across it's surface. Thus lighting the screen. But these new GBA SP's are actually back-lit, they light up just like a TV! It's so wonderful, and so much brighter than the older ones, about 3x as bright to be exact! Plus, because of how bright the screen is, there's less glare or a reflection of your own face on the screen, (and who likes to look at a reflection of their own face when playing a game?) Anyway, the new Pearl blue and Graphite GBA SP's are amazing and I highly recommend buying one if you've got the money, they're well worth it!  Pros: Alot brighter than the older models. It really is back-lit this time. The brighter screen is better for your eyes because you don't have to squint at the screen anymore, and it's better for your neck because now you don't have to lean your body or tilt your head to the side in order to see it clearly. The brighter screen lessens the occurence of glare and annoying reflection interupting game play.  Cons: It isn't avalible in as many colors as the older models. Battery life only lasts up to 13 hours when the older models lasted for up to 15 hours.  50/50: The back light can't be turned off, and it somewhat puts a drain on the battery. Screen attracts dust, but its easy enough to clean it off so who cares? Screen will glare when placed in the path of direct sun light, but once again, that's not really a problem.  Final thoughts: If you're going to buy this then I would highly recommend buying a new game to play with it, it's hard to enjoy it as much when you've got nothing new to try it out with.

This portable is great for anytime gameplay! Even in the dimmest lighting, playing your favorite GBA games has never been better.  For adaptivity, this is ranked 1st place.  But not only can you play games in the dark or slip it in your jacket pocket, you can also play your favorite GBC and GBP games!! And also for long car rides, so that your gameplay lasts longer, the battery life is AWESOME, also letting you RECHARGE your battery PACK for the first time in Nintendo history.  And to make things better, the battery life is extra long to make limited charge breaks.  But even when you need to charge, you can still play your games WHILE YOU CHARGE!!! So if you want a console that can:  1. Fit in almost any pocket  2. Have a bcklight for Take-Anywhere gameplay  3. Have long battery power  4. Play GBA,GBC, and GBP games    Buy this portable console, and you won't regret it!	1
Okay, the screen of Game Boy Advance is way too small. I don't what Nintendo was thinking when they came up with this. You might as well use a little cell phone to play games. If you want to lose your eyesight, go ahead and get this system. After a year, you will be wearing glasses like Urkel. Or if you currently wearing glasses, your eyesight will only get worse. The screen only show ants.	-1
GBA SP is a HUGE improvement over the original GBA. First of all, the back lit screen is revolutionary. It's a must have for all handhelds. I mean how did we go through 13 years of no light. Also there is a built in battery that is rechargable which is nice. You get about 8 hrs with the light and 10 hrs with no light I think. It flips opens for easy storage and the screen doesn't scratched as much. It's very portable and very small. Everything is fantasic about it. Except there is only one flaw. No headphone jack. Many gamers have complained about that. I don't mind it. It doesnt matter to me. Go buy this if you want a very revolutionized handeld. Must Have!	1
Jameson Thottam and the Game Boy Advance SP  Intro...Jameson Thottam  Before the Game Boy Advance SP, there were basically three ways to solve the lighting problem of the original GBA (Game Boy Advance). You could've:  1. Bought cheap, useless aftermarket add-ons.  2. Riskily took apart your GBA to install a backlight.  or  3. Skipped over the GBA entirely.  For those who can't wait for the next generation Game Boy to come out, buy a Game Boy Advance. So if you become fed up with the GBA's bulky size, bad colors, and LACK OF LIGHT, you can go to your nearest Circuit City and buy a brand spanking new Onyx (black) Game Boy Advance SP. Some colors available are: Flame (red), Pearl (white), Cobalt Blue, Platinum, and Classic (black and red). I strongly recommend Oynx, just because it's so stylish and sleek.  New Features ...Jameson Luke Thottam  The most notable new feature on the GBA SP is definitely the frontlight. If you have no idea what that is, it's LED lights place along the sides of the screen as opposed to being behind it. I haven't seen much difference, but I've heard from some people that frontlit screens cast shadows.  Also, the GBA SP incorporates a new clamshell design. This is definitely a pleasant change. The size factor has been greatly reduced and the screen is protected from the elements. There is also a never before seen feature on any previous Game Boys. A rechargeable battery! The Lithium-Ion battery in the SP can be used for 10 hours with the frontlight and up to 18 hrs without. Pretty impressive. The problem with this is that if you are going to be away from an outlet for a long time, you're going to have to ration your hours carefully. Overall, these new features are a godsend.  Specs of the awesome SP! ...Jameson L Thottam  The performance of the SP is identical to the old Advance console. 32 bit processor, 240x160 resolution, 2.9 inch screen size, and the same number of basic buttons. There is a new button. The backlight button, to be exact. With one click, you can turn the frontlight off/on. This is handy if you are in places with plenty of lighting and want to save battery power.  Accessories ...Jameson L. Thottam  Some of the old GBA accessories become obsolete on this console (hint: the WORMLIGHT) as the SP features the frontlight. Link cables, E-readers should all still work for the SP. For all you that don't know this, the GBA SP DOES NOT come with a headphone jack. I don't know why Nintendo decided to omit this feature, but a dongle to plug the heaphones into will cost an extra $5-7 bucks, depending where you buy it from.  Games ...Jameson Thottam  Ahh... Games. The most important feature of a good console. Without good games, the GBA SP would've become extinct already. There are no special games designed only for the Game Boy Advance SP. The SP can play all of the original GB games, GB color games, and GBA games. Practically all of the genres are covered. There are plenty of RPGs (Role Playing Games), sports, a few FPSs (First Person Shooters), racing, and platformer games. A few games I recommend are: Golden Sun 1 & 2, WarioWare Inc: Mega Microgame$, Pokemon, Final Fantasy, Metriod Fusion, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. There are over a 1000 games available for the GBA SP.  Sadly, the end of this review is near ...Jameson Thottam  Even with the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP available, I still highly recommend the Game Boy Advance SP. If you don't want or need expensive, bulky, or 3D graphics in a console, then the GBA SP is what you should definitely get. And for those who are still using the GBC and the GBA, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  Jameson Thottam	1
The size of the Game Boy Advance SP is great!  Unlike some of the other portable game systems, this one is not bulky.  When the SP first came out, I did not think I would like the flip screen of it, but now I prefer it to my Game Boy Advance.  Not only do I like the size of the SP, but I liked the fact that it didn't feel like I was going to go broke from buying the system, unlike some of the other portable systems available.  Another aspect of the SP that I enjoy is the fact I got it so I could play games on it, not watch movies.	1
The GameBoy Advance sp  is the best ninendo handheld ever. Ive had a nintendo DS before and I hated it. It was the same exact thing as the SP and the gamechips for it are so small youll lose it if you don't leave iits case. And  also had the newest gameboy the Gameboy micro. Its way to small im eleven and its like a toy car in my hands. Even though its ten  dollars more at 89.99. I highly recommend to the SP its only 79.99 for a new one and 59.99 for a used one at your local ebgames. I traded in my micro or the sp now I know I made the right desicion.	1
I mean it when I say it. This game is powerful on almost all categories.  MUSIC = 5 stars  CONTROLS = 4 stars (very happy with the auto-aim)  AI = 5 stars (excellent! Your men are very loyal and smart!)  STORY = 5 stars  I could sit and praise this wonderful game all day. But I suggest you read some of these other reviews and find out for yourself. If you buy and play this game, you will not be dissapointed.	1
Game developers need to look at this game very closely.  This game is simplicity at its finest.  Everything about it is simple...WHICH IS WHY IT IS PERFECT!!  I must say that this game wasn't truly fun in a traditional sense.  But if you have a political keenness, that doesn't matter.  The story begins at the early years of the 21st century (2002 or 2003 I think).  Chris Stone, a plumber and the hero of the story, is working on a job with his brother at a news anchor's house when.. DUN DUN DUN!  The Russians kick in the door searching for her.  The Russians have invaded US soil and are taking over!  So why in the world are the Russians holding up the Americans?  This game actually takes place in an alternate universe.  What would have happened back during WWII if the USSR had developed the first nuclear bomb?  The game answers that for you in the intro.  1945, the USSR drops the world's first A-Bomb on Berlin, ending the war and giving Communism the upper hand in Europe.  As the years pass, Communism takes over Europe, and I think in the `70s England is the last European nation to join.  The US is one of the final Capitalist nations left.  The Communists believe that the US is oppressing its poor people and other folks that live within the borders.  So, they decided to spread their doctrine of FREEDOM to the land of the OPPRESSED.  Sounds a little like present day politics, doesn't it?  By way of military might, the USSR forcibly occupies the United States.  But your man, Chris Stone, has other plans.  As Chris, you play as an insurgent....I mean...FREEDOM FIGHTER!  You and your ragtag gang of ticked-off Americans will shoot your way to the heart of the Communist regime in order to retake New York.  That's the story.  So how's the game?  It's simple. So simple.  In fact, the auto aim system is perfect.  Yes, it auto aims for you.  Most shooters can be determined based on how well you aim.  It is clear that the developers wanted players to experience other aspects of the game.  Charisma - As you complete your tasks, you will gain Charisma points.  Also, if you heal the wounded, the same happens.  When you gain about 50 points, you'll get enough charisma to recruit people.  The more charisma, the more allies.  I think that by the end of the game I had about 11 or 12 slots.  Squad based action - Squad control is perfect.  You can deliver 4 commands by using the X, Triangle, Circle, and Square keys, all of which are 100% useful.  AI Brains - Your allies are incredibly smart and powerful.  They know full well how to storm a room and clean up or charge a field while you provide cover fire from a perched machine gun.  Auto aim - This feature is actually very nice.  Often times you will see someone and start firing, but it will actually be your ally.  Since auto aim does not lock you onto your allies, chances are you probably didn't hit the person.  Difficulty - Very easy.  But this doesn't detract from the experience either.  Graphics - This is a 2003 game.  Therefore it suffers from 2003 PS2 graphics flaws.  For those of us who have been spoiled by the near-movie quality of graphics in the more recent 2005 games, then maybe this may cause some trouble,  But once you get over this, the game is superb.  The Music - IS AMAZING!!!  It is desperate, but not hopeless.  It effectively generates the "keep on fighting" feeling that one needs in any game about a revolution.  The Enemies - You will know when you've made a wrong turn.  The enemies aren't impossible, however if you miss a step, they will kill you very fast.  But it keeps the order in the story.  Saving  - The Autosave system is very nice.  It does all the saving for you, and it can never hurt your progress.  It's nice because you will never forget to save.  Also, you can quicksave at each manhole.  Bottom line:  The game is excellent.  I beat it in 4 hours...which is less time than I spent on Zone of the Enders.  I was very surprised.  But it was among the greatest four hours of non-Japanese gaming that I have done in a very long time.  Don't go comparing this game to Mercenaries because they are not the same.  Mercenaries is like a movie, but Freedom Fighters is way deeper.  Really think about it what's going on today when you are playing this game.  You will never forget playing it.  Happy gaming!  You should really check this game out.  It is one for the keeping.  It has replay value.  And even if you only play it once, for the price tag you might as well just buy it and share it.  Everyone will love it.	1
I first had the original gameboy advance and was reluctant to upgrade to the SP.  Well, the light I had for it died, and I couldn't find a replacement.  Thus me buying this little guy...  I'm kicking myself for not buying it earlier.  This is way more portable, has a built in light that rivals just about any you could buy for the standard gba, and it has a built in rechargible battery.  How can you go wrong?  And since it's backward compatible with all the previous gameboy systems, you can still enjoy the all the classic games you've collected over the years.	1
These days, there are just so many different companies that are just competeing into the handheld console video game wars. Nevertheless, with companies that've fizzled like Sega, and Sony's recent debut with the PSP, there is just so much to look out for, especially from Nintendo. Since the late 80's, their Game Boy has been the main trademark as one of the most successful, and the highest-selling video game system of all time. Yet, it also has gotten better with so many different improvements. Yet, while Nintendo is equally conjuring status with their DS handheld, the Game Boy still is a favorite.  The Game Boy Advance SP with the Peral Blue color, is a unique and compact device,  that can play all different Game Boy Advance greats like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario World 3, the mini-game madness of Wario Ware: Twisted, and newer favorite like DK: King Of Swing. It is easy to carry, and cost so much less for anybody who wants a game system. Not only that, but you can also play earlier versions of Game Boy classic games like Kirby's Dream Land, Tetris, and  Super Mario Land, as well as Game Boy Color games like Pokemon', and others as well. Yet, so many others are considering ther DS and the Game Boy Advance Micro as other considerations as hanhelds because, of their quality and games instead. While those are great, for anybody who owns those earlier Game Boy Games, you won't be able to play them on those handheld games systems, just here.  Anybody who loves games will defnitely want the Game Boy Advance SP. This is a great game system, and I love it because it is so affordable, and everybody loves it. I honestly recommend this handheld over the many others. I guarentee it.  Handheld: A  Price: A+  Control: A 1/2-  Sound: B+  Fun & Enjoyment: A  Overall: A	1
Like the gameboy advance sp, abut sports a brighter screen for better game experience. The screen is truly backlit like the gameboy micro and NDS, not frontlit like the older variations.. (...)	1
Nintendo has presented us with a tough choice: the new GBA SP or the Game Boy Micro. I was thinking about what I really wanted out of the Micro -- the bright screen, and the better ergonomics and controls. BUT the screen is tiny, and the SP's screen is plenty small as it is. I'm 35 years old and while my eyesight is perfect, there's no need to ruin that with a postage-stamp sized screen.  So I bought a baby blue metallic new-screen GBA today. There are other pictures on the internet comparing the old and the new, but none with that old-time Atari flair that we know and love! Here are some screenshots of the Activision Anthology on the old and new system, side by side. It's difficult to photograph these things, so excuse the quality of the pics. This game has some bright, vivid colors which are NOT done justice on the washed out old-style SP, but they really come alive on the new one.	1
The GBA SP is all about playing old-school style games we used to see on consoles like the Genesis and SNES. When the graphics were simpler the gameplay had to make up for it. And GBA has dozens and dozens of games out there, for cheap prices, that are brilliant.  The SP is also much better than the standard GBA because the clamshell design prevents scratching if you're carrying it around in your pocket and the screen is backlit for increased viewing clarity.  With the Nintendo DS out there now the GBA SP is a bit redundant as you can play GBA games on the SP. But don't worry, there are still loads of games getting made for it and the GBA can play all the old Gameboy and Gameboy Color games, which the DS cannot.  The battery life is also quite long so you won't have to recharge it too often. It's also probably the handheld console with the most amount of games out there. Definitely the one to get if you cannot afford a DS.	1
PLaying this game on twoplayer just to blow your body up with a grenade to see where your body will land is worth it. The games action is great to. I don't play it on 1 player much, but it doesnt matter its worth it if u have a buddy.  I traded 6 games for this thing.. and i don't think im much dissapointment. I just don't like the fact there's only THREE levels on two player. Yup. Only 3.  But buy this if u want a cheap but awesome game..	1
This game is one that will keep you playingfor hours. With very tough levels and very good AI, a gamer can't really ask for more.	1
This game may be one of the top 20 games for under $15, this game is cheap and fun! You should go out and buy this game right away!	1
Concept: Soviet forces have invaded and occupied New York! It is up to a handful of rebels using captured Soviet weapons to fight them off. You are Chris, a rebel fighter who, by deeds and actions, displays leadership to draw more and more fighters to the cause.  Graphics: Outstanding! the backgrounds are very well done, and the lighting and shading actually enables you to tell what time of year it is (fall, winter, etc.). people models are very well done, as enemy and rebel clothing and gear change as the weather changes (except for the sexy female rebel leader, who still chooses to wear as little as possible regardless of the weather). Soviet troops look GREAT. Specific uniforms denote enemy soldier classes (infantry, officers, snipers, even Spetznaz commandos-although the Spetznaz troops in the game are wearing RED berets, not blue berets). Weapon models are terrific. You can choose from captured AK-74 assault rifles, Bizon SMGs, PKM machine guns, RPG-7 rocket launchers SPAS-12 shotguns, and Baretta M92FS pistols (how'd the Rooskies get those last two? Hmm...). You also can use wrenches, grenades, and Molotov Cocktails in your battles.  Sound: Weapons and vehicles sound very real, especially when blasted through a home theater system. The voice acting isn't bad either (a rarity in games), but hearing your character say the same things over and over when issuing commands gets a bit old. It is also interesting to hear the enemy speaking (and dying) in Russian. Music is simply awesome. The semi-apocalyptic score adds to the already terrifying concept of the game.  Control: a little cluncky at first, but it is quickly and easily mastered. Aiming can be a pain in the rear, but after a while, you get over it. Commanding your rebel recruits is a breeze, and actually works well.  Overall: This game is a must for anyone who likes the action/shooter genre. It is also fun for those of us who remember the 1980's and the massive wave of anti-Soviet propaganda that capped off the Cold War. Great graphics and sound, good control, and a totally fresh premise make this a great title for just about anyone.	1
I've never really gotten into war games.  Well, besides the PC Return to Wolfenstein Demo and Advance Wars for the GBA.  I got this game based on good reviews from many different sources.  They are right.  This is an excellent game.  Very immersive.  And this is from a GTA and Ratchet & Clank junkie.  Another thing about this game, it is very hard.  You will really get a sense of accomplishment when you managed to finish missions.  Lots of crouch and creep, then blast, run, blast.  This game will make you stay up too late at night it's so compelling.	1
I love the backlit screen! This toy has more bang for the buck than almost any other I can think of. The internal battery and recharger is brilliant -- no more asking for new batteries (though I now have a nice collection of rechargable AAs!). Great titles, Nintendo's strong point.  Can I think of ANYTHING negative about a GBA? No, I cannot! I wish they'd had these when I was a kid!!!	1
Even with the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP out there, the GBA SP is still the best-selling portable video game system currently out there.  Design - The design of this console is excellent. It's small enough to fit in your pocket. Also the GBA SP comes in MANY colors, including red, onyx black, cobalt, platinum, and limited edition colors. The button layout is also very good.  Screen - Unlike the previous model, the GBA SP has a backlit screen, allowing you to play wherever you want, whenever you want. You can turn this feature on or off. Also this screen has a good size. The Flip-Top design allows you to adjust the screen to suit your needs. I recommend using the preset angle (150 degrees).  Graphics - This console can produce 32-bit graphics, which is very decent.  Games - With a library of over 700 titles, including favorites like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Pokemon, and F-zero, you definitely can't go wrong here.  Backward Compatability - Not only can you play GBA games on the GBA SP, but you can also play GBColor and original Game Boy games!  Connectivity - To play multiplayer games, you will need to buy a GBA link cable, which allows you to connect 2 GBAs (or 2 GBA SPs). Some GBA games are compatable with the Nintendo Gamecube and some Nintendo Gamecube games are compatable with the GBA (or GBA SP). To connect the GBA SP to the GAMECUBE, you will need to buy a GBA / GCN link cable. Both of these cables are very affordable. Please note that...  To play GBA Multiplaer games, you will need...  name of item  qty  -------------------  ---  GBA (or GBA SP)  1 for each player  GBA Link Cable  1 for 2 players, 2 for 4 players.  Game  For some games, 1 copy of the same game for each player, however some games require only 1 game pak for multiplayer.  To connect the GBA (SP or Original) to the Nintendo Gamecube, you will need...  GBA (SP or Original)  1 for each player  NINTENDO GAMECUBE  1  GBA/GCN LINK CABLE  1 for each player  GCN Game Compatable with the GBA*  1  *Note: Check the back of the box of each GBA and/or GCN game to see if the game can use the GBA/GCN feature and if so what GBA games do you need to use this feature. I recommend going to Nintendo.com. They have a full list of games that are compatable with this feature.  Summary: This is one of the best video game systems ever. The small design, cool colors, and the large selection of games makes this system a must-have for any gamer or anyone who wants to get into video gaming. I highly recommend it. 5 out of 5 stars	1
The Gameboy Advance SP shows us what on the go freestylefun we can have with video games. I loved the portability and the amount of battery life, this thing lasts 10 full blown hours of fun games!!!!!! on only 3 hours of charging. Sure the graphics aren't as good as the ds or psp, but it's a cheaper alternative to get a great portable device. The way it flips to protect the screen and to make it more portable is a great feature. And it already has a library of hundreds of games, thats more than you can say for the ds or psp. For only 80 bucks this is a very very very smart buy. so get one	1
Freedom Fighters has a reasonably strong storyline, and rather addictive gameplay. It wasn't an extremely difficult game, only taking me a few days (for those of you who have read other reviews by me, you know I'm a war junky), but some missions took several attempts. I think its difficulty is one of its greatest attributes, because it does have a few downfalls. There's very little weapons selection (the only American firearm available is a revolver, most likely a .357 Magnum, and all other guns are carried by the Soviets). The graphics are generally good, although the game has more of an animated sense, rather than realistic. Speaking of realism, some of the combat is really hindered. For instance, you'd think if you had a clear shot on an enemy's head (meaning he wasn't wearing a helmet or anything), he'd be dead after the first shot. But, with some of the more difficult opposers, specifically the fat red-heads with the SPAS-12 shotguns, they won't be killed first shot because of their thick body-armor suits, which reveal their head entirely. I think that's pretty uncool, not only because those guys are hard and it would be nice to kill them quickly, but because I highly appreciate realism. And there is one kind of outrageously difficult soldier to beat: Machinegunners in full steel bodysuits. They have very powerful weapons, and they're SOOO hard to take down. I've learned it's easiest just to hit them repeatedly with Molotovs until they die. Otherwise, it takes a whole lot of bullets. Multi-player is okay. I mean, it can be very fun, for long periods of time. But, there's only one mode, and only three places to play. The maps are small, you can only be one person (either the American, or the Soviet), and the people you recruit all carry the same weapon, a Kalashnikov AK of some sort, probably an AK-74. Yeah, I said 74, for all you THINK-you-know-it-alls. Recruiting is easy: There are four bunkers in every map. All you have to do is run into an unmanned bunker to take it over. Then your people spawn there, unless you have too many people at other places around the map. Then you go up to them and recruit a maximum of eight, and you can order them around. In single-player, it's the same concept, except you have to work your way up to be able to recruit more people, and you have to find them in the missions. Anyhow, back to multi-player, it is still fun. The main objective isn't to kill the other person (even though it is really exciting), because you keep coming back to life. The objective is to take the flag at the center of each map, and hold it for the time limit. I can explain further, but you'll understand once you play. Multi-player is extremely addictive, because it's fun to just kill as many people as possible, and take over all the bases. Even when you have no bunkers, it's fun in a sick way to try and capture some (I suggest using grenades and Molotovs to blow or burn the enemies out of the bunker, then move in). In general, Freedom Fighters is a good game. It's got good replayability. It can last a while, because you do have to develop extensive strategy for many of the missions, and some missions affect others. Ultimately, I think this is a good game to purchase. Fun in two-player, and fun in single-player.	1
Freedom Fighters was better then I hoped. My 9 year old brother goes and buys FF,I didn't know if that was a good idea. Man I'm happy now. Here's the story: In a alternate world where the "Soviets" ended WW2,the soviets have grown very powerful. They have defeated most(or all)of Europe,took over Mexico,and are circling around America. Its Summer of 2003 and Plumbers Chris and Troy Stone get a call from a girl named Isabella to come fix her sink. When they get their,nobodys home..."Bang",Soviets invade the room,take Troy, and invade the city. As Chris you must take back the city and defeat the Soviets. Graphics:9/10 Not too bad. ------------ Sound:10/10 Very good sound effects and music sounds nice. ------------ AI:7/10 The Soviets take cover and fire but they are not too smart. ------------ Gameplay:10/10 The gameplay is awesome. You can go the sewers anytime and do different things. You can choose their where to go and what guns you want. ------------ Overall:9.3 A very good game. With 10 levels,Alot of characters,and a Armory of guns,this game is a must.	1
There are few games that I'd use the term "great" while describing them. Freedom Fighters is such a game. Though released to critical acclaim in the fall of 2003, the game became a "sleeper" with higher profile titles being released around the same time. That critical acclaim was well deserved, because this is one game that has managed to surpass every one of my expectations. Freedom Fighters takes place in what is described as an "alternate reality". In this timeline, the Soviet Union was the first to develop the Atom Bomb and bring and end to World War II. The game is prefaced by a brief rundown of events leading up to the present day. When the game begins, you find the game's hero, a New York plumber by the name of Chris Stone, is going about his daily route. When he and his brother stop to fix a clogged sink of a prominent anti-Soviet activist, he finds himself smack in the middle of the Red Army invasion. He's then thrust into the role of guerilla fighter. The gameplay is what makes Freedom Fighters such an outstanding game. The game is a third person shooter. As you progress in the game and accomplish certain objectives, you gain "Charisma Points" which elevates your status eventually to where you can command fellow soldiers. You can recruit and command up to twelve freedom fighters with a very basic command interface, using the controller buttons, that works surprisingly well. Your troops will take cover and fight independantly when they need to, so you won't have to worry about them getting picked off one by one. The enemy A.I. is also very sophisticated. The Red Army will fight just as fiercely as your troops and will often try to pull and "end around", trying to sneak up on you and take you by surprise. The only thing that I didn't like about the controls was the precise aiming. It tended to be a bit of a pain to hold down the L3 button. The gameplay is structured so that whatever you accomplish in one mission ultimately affects another. For instance, if you blow up a helipad there will be no attack helicopters in another level. There is also an off-line multiplayer mode, which players engage in split screen action and co-op mode. The graphics on this game are excellent, while other games may boast more photo realistic character models, the emphasis here placed on making the player feel like he was actually fighting on the streets of New York. Streets, street lights, snow, and even elevated train platforms have a very "New York" feel to them. One of the more intersting graphical features is what's called "rag doll" physics. When a parked car explodes it sends whoever is standing next to it flying into the air. Which makes for some pretty cool visuals. The sounds are also exceptional. Soldiers speak Russian, explosions rock the dual shock controller, tanks rumble through the streets. This game sounds as great as it looks and plays. The story is moved along through the use of fake newscasts from the Soviet Armed Forces Network. This is a technique that was used in another game, Splinter Cell, earlier in 2003. But here the newscasts do a much better job at moving the story along. The obvious difference is that in Splinter Cell, the hero was operation covertly, but the newscasts did little to shed any light on the story and often felt like they were not interwoven into the fabric of the game. Here the newsbroadcasts feel like they are part of the game and help to immerse you further into the game. Freedom Fighters is without a doubt one of the best games of 2003. If you're not playing it, you're really missing out on one of those really special games that makes you glad you own a Playstation 2. I HIGHLY recomend this game!	1
This game was solid and decent. My only gripe was that it was too short, the only reason I gave it four out of five stars. Otherwise I would buy this game or give it some serious consideration. You recruit your army of rebels straight off the street (depending on your charisma level) and you don't necessarily train them. You tell them to either DEFEND, SCOUT, or REGROUP. There's no need to get anymore complicated than that though custom options would've been nice. The people you recruit are pretty smart, if there's an enemy Soviet shooting at them, they seek cover automatically. This game is difficult even on the easy level so there's definitely a challenge factor to it. A nice complimentary game to say SOCOM II! DEFINITE REPLAY VALUE!!	1
I'll start by saying I hope they make a sequel to this game! This game was fast paced and it's one game that I sat playing until I finished.  The bad news is it's too short, but that's not exactly terrible news because the game is awesome. You play a single character, but you bring more fighters with you as you go on.  There are various weapons although short of using cheat codes the ammo is pretty scarce so you need to watch what you are doing. Really I wasn't sure I'd like this game there are very few games that I like with this time of storyline/gameplay.  I WAS SOOOO WRONG!  This game was great.  I had so much fun playing it and love going back to playing it still. Now I hope they make a second that is equally fun but longer in length!	1
FF is a very good game, with a good history, It has 4 levels of Difficulty, Personally I started on the 3rd level and was a little hard on the first missions but really entertain. Here come some pros and cons of the game PROS 1- You r the lider of a group of rebels that fight against the new Russian (red) order, so this offer you the ability of recruit some rebels that wants to joins the cause, this is real funny because U can control until 12 rebels, and give orders just like: -Scout, Defend Positinos, Attack specific targets or areas,etc. 2-The Music is really good 3-Quick Saves (you can save your progress on sewers entrance) are really usefuls since the misions demands a lot of time. Cons 1- The graphics could be better 2- The weapons, sometimes is hard to find the right weapon for the job, specially when you're carring the Machine Gun and want to pick up a Sniper rifle, YOU cant carry Both... NOT like GTA 3- I do not like some control moves, for example if you are on a situacion of cross or heavy fire and you need to use a Health pack. Basically for these 3 reason I don't give the 5 stars, BUT Definitely FF is a vary GOOD game and a MUST BUY for most PS2 Gamers.	1
At first I was skeptical of this game, but I decided to pick it up based on some things I'd heard about it from other people who'd played it. I'm really glad I did! I just bought it a couple days ago and played it for 10 hrs. straight yesterday, it's that addictive! The story line is great, in fact even though the Soviet Union hasn't existed since 1990-91 and hasn't been a military threat to the US for decades, this story line is carried so well in the game it's downright believable sometimes. The graphics are simply awesome. Everything in every level looks very real, including the "cut" video scenes at the end of every level. The two main characters, Chris (who's the guy you play as in single player mode) and his brother are designed to look as what Mario and Luigi would look like if they were real people instead of cartoonish characters. The only drawback to the graphics I've seen so far is that while there's several different levels dependent on what you've done before in the game, the levels take place in different areas of the same places. There's two levels (that I've seen so far) on the docks area. Rather than this being IO/EA Games being cheap on the design, I think it's just because the whole story line takes place in NY City, so the designers are pretty much stuck with certain areas of NY for any levels that take place at the docks. There's a multitude of weapons to use in the game, you choose which weapon you wish to use because you're not only able to pick up additional ammunition but on occasion drop the current weapon you have and pick up the weapon of somebody you or your team has just killed. This is especially useful in tougher levels where finding ammunition isn't as easy. The team aspect of a single player mission is very SOCOM like. You're the team leader and can issue orders to your fighters. One additional fun thing is you've got to recruit fighters to join your anti-Soviet fight. If you've got enough "charisma" which you earn by freeing POWs, healing civilian wounded and other (mostly) non-killing things during the game, people will join your cause. If you don't, people will refuse your recruitment. It also seems that the designers have made each CPU character you can recruit have different fighting abilities. So far, I've had teams of recruited fighters that seemed to fight and follow orders better than others. Even on the easiest setting, the AI does present a challenge in most levels, they don't just walk in blindly to your fire and almost willingly get killed. There are also soldiers with full body armor on in the game in certain places. These guys take a lot of strategy and smarts to deal with because unless you shoot them in the face, everything else just bounces off. It also even takes multiple grenades or molitovs to kill the guy. I think it's great because it requires you to use stealth sneaking as well as use your weapons wisely. I also think as a bonus for players who don't play this type of game very much the levels on the easiest setting aren't TOO difficult and shouldn't cause a player to give up in frustration after just a couple levels. I really hope this isn't just a one-time game from IO/EA Games. This game I think is of such good quality that it's worthy of a series of games that come out yearly, just like the Medal of Honor series. Perhaps the next game could be about terrorism in NYC and not the Soviets.	1
When I first saw this I thought it was kind of dumb I didn't really care about the rechargeable battery or how you could fold it in half or even the back-lighting. I had a worm light so that didn't bother me too much. Well then my friend got one and I noticed how increasingly jealous I was getting. The back lighting feature is light years better than the wormlight, it's much easier to see the game and you don't have to worry about the glare that worm light would always give you. It also gives the games a brighter and more vibrant color. The folding is nice because I can put it in my pocket during school, and whenever a teacher walks by I can fold it back together and put it back into my pocket without worrying about the moniter betting scratched or chipped. A big improvement over the original GBA and I like this much more over the Nintendo DS. Buy this for sure!	1
The SP is a small step for gamers but a giant leap for Nintendo. The convience, fun, and portability of the GBA just got better. The SP is smaller, easier on the hands, and has an illuminator behind the screen so you can actually see the game you're playing. Also the SP doesn't switch games so you can still get the GBA Games for it.	1

I just purchased the GBASP, and while I have not played at great length, I must say that initially, I am blown away! I was attracted to it not only by the compact size and small screen, but the exceptional low price as well. It will be great to take my gaming habit wherever I want to go. In addition, it is not loaded with bells and whistles like it's newer brother, the DS, and is simple to use. I know of a few people whose only system is the Gameboy, so if you want something simple and portable, this is for you!  the SP is very easy and fun to operate. In addition, the endless list of games will keep you busy for a long, long time. While everyone seems to be raving over the DS, I'm having a great time with the SP.  Tip. Be sure to get a carrying case, as if you put it in your pockets, lint, dust, etc. will get into the system.	1
The Game Boy SP is the greatest thing I have ever held in my hands that was not distilled in Scotland.  I've never owned a Game Boy before this; my sister has had an original Game Boy for a good while, but I've had nothing in between. I hear the GBA was terrible without a light, and certainly this looks beautiful with its light; I actually like playing it in the dark, since I can see the excellent graphics so well. The rechargeable battery is sheer genius and lasts a good long time, even with the light on.  This thing is tiny and there's no problem carrying it around, but it manages to pack enough power to play some great games - Metroid Fusion is particularly pretty. The Super Mario Advance rereleases are a great idea, since those are some of the best games Nintendo has made; I bought Yoshi's Island, as it is clearly the best of the group (see my review). If you want to play the old Game Boy games, you can't get a DS, since that's only compatible with GBA games, whereas this will play anything from Super Mario Land (giggle, don't laugh) on up.  I would like to address problems people have had with this that have no merit before I get to the legitimate problems that caused me to rate this lower than five stars. The battery pack recharges five hundred times before you need to buy a new one. That's roughly five thousand hours of playing time. If wearing the battery pack out is a serious concern to you, get the following: a. a job; b. a girlfriend; c. a life. If you can play this enough hours out of the day to worry yourself that the battery might go bad, you need to step outside maybe once a month, at least to buy groceries.  It's true that older Game Boy games stick out of this since they longer than GBA games and the slot isn't designed for them, but you'd have to be a bigtime neurotic to care about this. When you're playing the game, you can't even see the cartridge, and if you're holding the system right up against your chest, you're a freak.  Real problems? As has been mentioned, the system is so small that you have to handcuff yourself to play it. Over extended periods of continuous play this can be very painful. Also, the system requires a headphone adapter, and can't simply accept standard headphones without this extra. I don't use headphones anyway, but this is certainly a disadvantage to the system.  My major beef is the control scheme, since the buttons are too close together and it's painful to play for very long, but I still give it an excellent four-star rating. For pure fun this is perfect.	1
Let's go back to my 9th birthday.   I got a Game Boy Color and Pokemon Yellow. I loved that thing so much; I played it all the time. I collected a fair library of games for it and played it until I got this thing.  Now let's go to 2001.  The Game Boy Advance came out. Not this one, the original GBA. A lot of my friends got this for Christmas and their birthdays. However, I never got one and I was stuck with by outdated GBC.  Now, let's go to my 13th birthday.  I GOT THIS!  Now let's end this little timeline.  This is a great product with great games, great style, everything. The price just dropped so if you are on a low budget but want some great fun look into this.  However, if I were you I'd save my money! The Nintendo DS is coming out VERY soon - about 2 weeks - and this new thing will be backwards compatible with GBA games and build up a game library for only itself. However, they are being sold out everywhere. You can still preorder at:  [...]  [...]  [...]  Overall, this thing is being replaced my the next generation handhelds DS and PSP but will forever be a legendary handheld. This will provide a ton of fun but you might want to wait for the DS.	1
I have owned GameBoy portables since they came out in the 1980s.  Never have I enjoyed Nintendo's handheld technology more than with this product.  Taking the best parts of the GameBoy Advance (large color screen, access to an excellent game library), Nintendo has improved upon its original model by adding several great features.  The features I enjoy most include:  * Backlight --> you can play your GBA SP in dim rooms, on the move (when you don't have access to extra light), heck, you can play it IN THE DARK!  This is an amazing improvement.  I'm sure that the third party market that has made a mint off lights for the GameBoy and original GameBoy Advance systems are very mad, but this internal light is even better than any of the numerous add-ons I've bought over the years.  * Rechargeable-battery (with adapter) --> you can now charge the internal battery by plugging it into the wall (or by buying a separate car charger).  The battery lasts anywhere from 6 - 10 hours (depending on whether you use the backlight or not).  * Flip-top screen --> this smaller, sleeker design also serves to protect the screen from getting scratched  All told, these additions are amazing, and saved me at least $25 (now that I don't have to buy all those add-ons from another company).  I really enjoy my GameBoy Advance SP, and play all of the great new GBA games as well as my old black and white GameBoy favorites on it.	1
Can't complain about the price since I bought the original Gameboy over 10 years ago for close to the same amount.   Pros:   Small dimensions...you can fit it anywhere (pocket, purse, etc.)   Very light weight   Folding design protects the screen from scratches/damage   Able to revive/play my original Gameboy games   Rechargable battery lets you save money on buying batteries   Rechargable battery actually lasts quite a while   Given a light on/off option to save batteries   Lots of really useful accessories in the market--best one I purchased is the AC/DC/Car Adapter   Lights indicate "fully charged" and "low battery"   PERFECT for traveling!   Cons:   Didn't come with a game   Ports in the rear are unprotected (uncovered)   A little too smooth design...makes it slippery   Games are expensive (typical...3-4 games = game console)   Headphone jack should have been a given (Why the adapter?)   Original adapter should have been dual voltage (after all, the GBA is designed for travelling, isn't it?)   Wishful thinking:   Protective rubber around it for shock-proofing and better grip   Adjustable light levels	1
Ive had a lot of fun with my Game Boy Advance SP. I must say that its the system I play the most cause I can take it with me anywhere. I play it at lunchbreak,on the bus,home,hotel rooms wherever. It rocks. The games I love are Super Mario World,Super Mario 2,Super Mario 3,Yoshis Island,F Zero Maximum Velocity,A Link To The Past,Castlevania Aria Of Sorrow,Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero Mission. I must say though Im eagerly anticipating the new Game Boy DS which will be the most advance handheld system in the world.    It will have over 64 bits and hopefully the games will be good and it will have rereleases of old N64 games like Super Mario 64 and Ocarina Of Time. Can you imagine playing games that advanced anywhere you go?That would be awesome. What would be even better would be if they make a new Mario game instead of what theyve been doing lately which is just rereleasing the old ones. I sure hope that the number of quality games would match the original Game Boy Advance's. Im gonna have to restrain myself however and wait until the price drops to 100 dollars though cause it would be a better deal on a great product. Game Boy forever!	1
there are two types of people in the gaming world. those two people are the fast food gamers,and the hardcore gamers. the fast food gamer plays for fun, to loosen up, but videogames never really become a part of their personality. Hardcore gamers live for great gameplay, great games, and overall, great gaming innovation. For the hardcore gamer everywhere, there is the game boy advance SP. A little side note is that the letter SP stand for absolutely nothing, said by the creater himself! The SP is pefect for your hardcore gamer on the go. The most noticable addition to this gameboy is its backlight feature. It is now possible to pla your gameboy in any lighting through light under the screen, which casts perfect light to every piece of the screen. As for battery life, it varies. The game boy SP runs on a lithium ion battery, and is rechargable (charger included), which means no more batteries! At the start of your SP's lifespan, it will play for 10 hours without the backlight, which can easily be switched on and off by one button press,and 8 hours with, slightly less. Since the SP runs on a lithium ion battery, the battery can hold progressively less as you recharge. The battery is good for about 500 charges before it is necasry to purchase a new one (about 5 to 15 dollars depending on size.) For all the newbies to the whole videogame scene, the SP is backward compatible. This means that you can play just about any game for any game boy that has ever been released, but the next style of cartidge that is released for the next gen handhelds will be incompatible with the SP. to put it quite simply, any new systems games will nto be playable on this system. another small edge that the SP has over the original GBA is its size. The original GBA is a bit large, and it is foolish to think you will fit anything else in your pocket if you GBA is already in there. The SP answers this problem with a sort of fold  it in half style. This way it takes up even less space in your pocket than the original GBA. This little feature also hides the screen and reduces kinicks and scratchs say from having keys in your pocket with your GBA in conclusion, SP is perfect for the hardcore gamer. Is it completely essential? no. The original gameboy advance can do everything the SP can short of the backlight and rechargeable battery. Is the SP much more user friendly, O YAH! P.S. i thought it may be useful info to all you who own the kirby tilt and tumble game out there that it will not work in the SP. since the cartidges are put in upside down, it basically flips all of the controls for the tilt and tumble game.	1
If you're planning on getting this now you're stupid. A new system is coming out in November called the Nintendo DS. If you don't believe me just go to [...] and type in the search engine "Nintendo DS" or just DS. It has Dual screens(The bottom screen is like the inventory and it's a touch screen), It has a microphone for voice commands or at least that is what it said on the description, and it said something about cards but nothing about cartridges. If you guys got SPs right now then maybe in November you can trade it in with some games to buy the DS at electronic boutique(it says it costs $199.99).	1
The Game Boy Advance was and still is an excellent system, and really put Nintendo ahead by a mile in the portable gaming industry.  However, there were a few specific problems, unfortunately, with the system that inconvenienced some.  For one it did not have any protective cover and seemed to scratch really easily, and the screen was very dark.  One such example is when playing Castlevania: CoTM; I literally had to hold the console right under the light bulb in order to view the game.  However, the GBA SP has taken everything to a new level with its remarkably sleek design, nice cover, and built in light system.  The last feature alone is more than enough to shell out the price of 100 dollars for the system. The size of the system is just perfect and its light and compact design allow it to fit just about anywhere.  The system layout is still the same as before, with the start and select buttons being in the center, triggers on the shoulders, and the traditional A-B layout being on the right.  The control pad is very responsive and simple, so you do not have to hold it down or push hard to get the actions to commence.  Now the only real complaint that I had with this new design is that it is very difficult to remove the batteries.  Instead of a simple snap off design, it is instead replaced by a small screw that you have to undo in order to remove said battery.  However, this whole thing can be ignored because of the AC adapter charge that the system comes with.  Which basically means you never have to replace batteries, all you have to do is leave the charge on for about an hour, and it will be good as new.  Speaking of batteries, the life of it is very good and once charged, it does not have to be charged again for several hours. All in all, with its wide variety of colors, impressive game selection, nice design, and light weight, the Game Boy Advance SP is worth every penny.  Just remember to take a little screw-driver with you when you go on long trips, unless you have an adapter console available in your car.  Happy Gaming!	1
Igot this for christmass and I was like WhoaH!!! and my cousin was like Whoaahhhhh1. And It came with a radical rechager and i was like Whoah!!!!!!!!

This gameboy is awesome. Color is cool. I plyed Donkey Kong Country on this and the graphics are awesome. Sound is incredible. I can play this with no light on in the dark and still see the screen better then the gameboy advance. it still holds the gameboy advance games. I can't wait for the next kind of gameboy.	1
I played Donkey Kong Country on this and it's great. The graphics are great and the sound is incredible. I can play the game with no lights on at all. You can see the screen perfectly in the dark. It portable and can fit in your pocket but its easier to lose. It still has many games because it can hold gameboy advance games. I recommend this if you liked any gameboys before this because this is better and there are more kinds to come.	1
ok heres the good things and bad things you should consider! GOOD THINGS - Backlight for in the dark gaming. no more getting into postition for the light.  Great compact gameboy, pocket size to take with you everywhere!  Rechargable battery! yes! no more buying batteries! 3 hours charging time, 12 hours gaming time with light on and 18 without light on! BAD - no! no! no!  no earphone socket! you need to buy a special adapter for it. i think thats all for the bad things!  i do recondmend buying it then the normall gba	1
If you're into mobile gaming,then it's the best. The Nokia Ngage doesn't stand a chance against it. Even if the Graphics of GameBoy isn't as good as other consoles,I still stick to it. The SP's design is pretty neat. It can play all earlier GameBoy games and it can be carried anywhere. The Backlit is cool. You don't have to worry about charging it all the time because it provides 18 hours of Gameplay(backlit off).So if you think consoles are a bit too costly,it is the next best thing. I don't think PSP will also be not much competetion to it.	1
GameBoy Advance Sp is the same thing as gameboy color but they added a built in light and changed the shape. The grafics are horible you cant tell what anything is. If you allready have a game boy don't buy this. The games have only about 4 levels in them and they are more like demos. I recomend you get PS2 or Xbox. GameCube isn't that good. Nintendo just wants to make money because every 9 months a new Gameboy comes out. Nintendo should go out of bussiness. The game boy is just some computer chips covered in cheap plastic. Please don't buy this.	-1
Gameboy Advance SP solves the problems that the original Gameboy Advance had.  Namely, it provides a backlight that makes the system usable in any lighting conditions.  The older version, while a technological marvel when it came to the handheld gaming platform was hampered by the lack of a backlight, the dark shadings of most of its games, and the truly atrocious external lighting accessories that could be purchased for the system.  The SP version's backlight eliminates those problems while also improving on the rest of the system.  The SP is more compact than the original advance, making it more portable.  It also has a foldover design that enables the screen to be protected when not in use, thereby avoiding the scratches the original system was susceptible to.  Finally, the system, itself, requires no batteries.  It's power source is internal and only requires a charging after about 12 of continous play.  The only drawback in this system is the lack of a jack for earphones, but that is a minor, minor flaw.  This system can still play every Gameboy game every created (back to the original 15-year old system) and has a wealth of tremdenous titles at its disposal (like the Metroid series and numerous older games that get ported for the handheld platform).  Don't be put off by the SP's 3 1/2 star average rating.  Many of the negative reviewers are people who dislike Nintendo in general.  Objectively, the quality of the SP is tremendous and the titles at its disposal are incredible.	1
The Game Boy Advance SP is a great gaming platform and has actually sparked a renewed interest in my gaming. Previous Game Boys had been portable, but not so small that they could truly go anywhere. The GBA SP's clamshell design makes it fold into a compact package of about 3"x3"x1" -- approximately the size of a wallet, but perfect for sliding into a pocket. And what else is great is the rechargable battery. You won't have to search for batteries or keep spending tons of money on batteries if you play often. Just plug it in to recharge and in three hours, you're good to go. Sound and graphics are great -- for a portable. Sometimes the sound is a bit scratchy using the GBA SP's built-in speaker. Still, given how little space the designers had to work with, it's great. Controls are comfortably sized -- I usually prefer a larger controller, but I've never had any discomfort in my hands while using the GBA SP for an extended period. It's also lighter than previous Game Boys, which may help. Finally, the games available are phenomenal. It's like having a portable Super Nintendo -- and in fact, many of that system's games are available for the GBA SP. It's probably my favorite platform in quite a while. Lots of fun, great games available, extremely portable and lightweight -- a must-have. The only thing to be aware of: The manual touts a ridiculous amount of battery life without the light on. Don't rely on that; the only time the system is comfortably usable without the light is in bright light (like sunlight). Never fear, though: The battery life with the sidelit display is still excellent.	1
IN the new gameboy advanced sp there is a rechargeable battery and a internal light.  these two new features on the game boy helped me alot.  frequently i would run out of batteries and not have any more lying around but now you can just recharge it in about 3 hours and get 18 hours of playing time (about 10 if the light is on).  also i would hate it when it gets dark out and your have to stop playing because you cant see it but the internal light is great and evenly distributes light across the whole screen	1
This new SP is so cool!  I got it for christmas.  I play it under my covers at night in the dark. I play it anywhere and I don't need a flashlight or anything. The light shines as bright as it can get (10/10),  The colors on the games they make for it are all colors, no more black & white crap (10/10) And its small enough to fit into your pocket, maybe wallet and other places,(10/10, but the sound shouldve been a bit louder (8.5/10) So...this is like pretty much the best of the best you can get.	1
For those of you complaining that you need to get another gameboy and all that, no need to complain. Just because the GBA SP is out and you've got a GBA already that doesn't mean you HAVE to get a GBA SP if you're content with the GBA you have now then you'll be fine.  Others, such as myself may find the GBA SP to be a nice investment. At first you'd wonder why anyone would buy a GBA SP if you've already got a GBA.  Well, let me tell you why I invested in mine. To start off, the GBA SP has a fold down LCD screen and it comes with a backlight!  That was reason number one for me to get it.  Since the LCD screen is fold down it makes it a lot easier to take care of it.  My original GBA screen is much too scratched up and that doesn't have a backlight so I was always running around searching for light. What's also nice about the backlight is that you can turn it off if you like and save battery power that way. Second, all games that work on the previous gameboys work on this one perfectly and let for little problems. You can also play original Gameboy games and Gameboy color games in widescreen (though some look TERRIBLE that way). Thrid, the GBA SP has a recharable battery that can be recharged up to 500 times!  Much better than having to run out to the store and buy batteries all the time.  The GBA SP can be played for hours before having to be recharged, and if you turn off the backlight (you don't need to have it on ALL the time) you can play even longer. Also, if your battery dies just plug in the recharger and you can start playing before it gets fully charged while the adapter is pluged in. The GBA SP will CHARGE WHILE YOU PLAY! With those three things also come a few problems.  What stands out first is the obvious, no place to plug in your headphones meaning that after you spend 100 bucks on the GBA SP you'll have to spend more to buy a set of headphones! The other problem is that the L and R buttons take some time to get used to. They're not as big as they were on the original GBA. Also to go along with this, because the L and R buttons are small if you've got big hands it's a pain to press the buttons and it feels uncomfortable. While the backlight is a nice feature, remember that the screen IS LCD meaning that the backlight can sometimes cause a disturbance in the graphical presentation of the game. Sometimes its best to turn off the backlight. Lastly, eventually you'll have to replace that batter and getting that screw off is very frustrating and'll take you the better half of the day to do it. The GBA SP is actually not a bad investment.  As far as games go there's no difference in the presentation and I'd hope you all know that already. Finally (and this applies to all GBA users), you might want to check out some reviews on GBA games. Chances are if it isn't an exclusive GBA game or it's not an SNES port it isn't worth the buy. If the game is already on the PS2, XBOX or GCN it usually isn't going to be that good on the GBA, so some reviews are handy. OVERALL: The Good +Nintendo finally put in a backlight! +Fold down LCD screen makes it easier to take care of +You can take it virtually anywhere! It fits in your pocket just fine +Rechargeable battery pack! +You don't need to constantly buy new batteries +You can turn the backlight on and off +A HUGE selection of games (especially if you count Gameboy and Gameboy color games). The bad -The backlight can sometimes bring out the worst in the graphics -No place to plug in headphones forcing you to go out and buy some -L and R buttons are small and take time to get used to -If you've got really big hands the original GBA is your best bet	1
I had the original Game boy when I was a kid, and remembered how much fun I had with it.  I've always owned console systems like Nintendo, but there's just something about being able to take the games with you that make it such fun. The Game Boy advance is the most fun console system I've owned and here's why: Pros: Backlit (major pro!) Battery Life - The system has a fairly decent battery life, and since it is recharged, you don't have to worry about buying batteries every week. Size - Much smaller than the Original Game Boy advance, but easy on the hands.  When I first saw it I thought the small size and square look of it would be uncomfortable and thought about getting the original Game Boy Advance instead.  The SP version is actually much more like the original Game Boy once it's folded out and very easy to use.  It feels very natural to me. Graphics - The 32 bit graphics and colo are excellent!  The first game I bought was  "The Two Towers" and I was blown away by a short cinematic sequence from the movie that it reproduced.  It was like I was watching a portable TV.  Whenever I want to impress someone with my Game Boy I show them that scene. Cons: No headphone jack - It's unbelievable that they did not include a headphone jack on a portable gaming system. Sound - The sound on many of the games is a bit choppy.  Given what Cell Phones can do now with polyphonic ring tones, and how great the graphics are, it's surprising that they didn't put in a better sound engine.  The sound quality should be at least twice what it is. Price - Without a bundled game, the price of the SP should be closer to $70.  All console systems should be packaged with a game.  In  addition, Nintendo does not make very many games specifically for Game Boy.  They are more in the habit of porting existing games or old SNES games to it.	1
The Game Boy Advacned Sp may look like an overpriced little gadget that is no difference then the original. Don't listen to that. Because the Sp is 10x better then Game Boy Advanced. It may be expensive but if you have the money, get it. Graphics are fatter and bolder Pro's: Lighting device so you could see in the dark. Flip-top so the screen don't scratch. Charges just like a phone so NO BATTERIES! Easy to carry around, it fits in your pocket. Good in blackouts. Could be used as a lighting source. Sound is 10x better then original. Con's: a little pricey	1
For starters, I like how Nintendo created the design, the battery, and multiple beautiful colors for anyones taste. The thing of it is, is that its odd w/ the control pad. It feels like its so deep i can barely push up or down, etc. Thats all i think think is wrong, but anyone could get used to it. The battery. Built in and rechargable. No more goin to Wal-mart for some stupid batteries. Im not sure how long it takes, but I know it takes a long time before recharging once again. The light. Built in just like the battery but uses up a quite amount of juice from the battery. Thankfully not much, though the light is the best feature, instead of buying one for the GBA or GBC. The light is so usefull, its needed practically every second you play. It still satisfies your urges to play as much as you want. The design. I like this alot. Kind of like a laptop, and buttons are hard to reach, and the cartridge spot is just right. I couldn't find the L and R button when i first saw this thing though :P. THe volume and button switches seem fine too. So overall, this does seem like a pretty good thing to buy. I'm not very fond of the price myself, but with all these features, going to the store every month to get a (light, batteries, add-on) will be a thing of the past. Oh, and one more thing. I was looking at a magazine the otherday, and found out the Playstation portable i called it PSP before i new that was its actually name (weird eh?) and the PSP has the SAME design as the GBASP. Coming out around late 2004. So if you haven't gotten this yet, you might want to look over websites, magazines or whatever to find out about the PSP and its...simularities.	1
First off, let me mention..this is my favorite color out of them all. That being said,I think the Gameboy Advance SP is a great handheld videogame console. The things that I love most about it are the clamshell design, the backlighting(so you can see your games now) and the built-in lithium-ion battery(all you have to do is charge it up and you're ready to go). All these things combined make this one sleek system. One that will continue to dominate even when everyone else comes out with their handheld systems. Why? Lots of reasons. Like the fact that it's alot more affordable to get and the games for it don't cost you an arm and a leg(mostly in the $25 to $35 range depending on what games you get for it). Beyond that, there's a huge library of games for it as well as a huge back library of games(from the original GB up to the GBC). That said, I urge all those who's thought about getting one to get one. You'll be glad you did, trust me. It's more than just a handheld SuperNintendo system. Check it out and you'll see what I mean.	1

I have purchased the limited Edition gold GBA SP with Mario advance 4 SMB 3 I like it a lot.  I haven't owned a game boy since the early 90's and I don't regret my purchase. for $99.99 you get the limited edition gold color GBA SP with the mario game included (a $29.99-$34.99 value by it self unless its on sale) and you also get a mail in coupon for FREE headphones not bad for the asking price if you ask me.  The system comes parshally charged it takes about 3 hours give or take.  It was a blast playing super mario advnce 4 smb 3 I was afraid I might have gotten rusty since I hadn't played it in over 10 years but it was a real hoot to play again.  My only gripe or downside was not the size of the screen it self but the screen is dark even when played in a well lit area I find myself using the built in light (ok I haven't exactly gone outside or tried it in a diffrent area yet) but the room I'm in is pretty bright so it was a little frusrating for me.  This was a Toys R us Exclusive so I don't know how many were made but I am glad I finally got one.  I'd planned to get one back when it was released in March but I am glad I waited.  Even with the screen issue I am giving this bundle 5 stars.  Also the first mario bros game is included so that was a nice bonus too.	1
this thing is so sweet the battery last so long and the games look so clean and good graphics i recomend this to any body get this thing!	1
This is a very cool item i have to admit, but i already have a regular game boy advance. me, personally am not going to buy it, cuz i have an advance already, why spend 100 for just a cooler look, i don't mind the regular advance. i say wait untill the price drops to buy. P.S. go 2 freewebs.com/troys_cool_site	-1
I nevered owned a gameboy before I bought the SP and the thing that made me buy it was old school gaming.  There is no other system other than the NES, SNES, or computer where you can play any of the original Mario Brothers games or many of the other original games that have been through video game history.  I sadly don't have a NES anymore because it broke from too much use.  Some people talk about better handheld game systems but the one at [...] is over $200 dollars and has no Nintendo games.  Nintendo is where its at for classic gaming at a low price.	1
this is something that people have been waiting for, for about ten years...therefore it is worth the money. the design looks small but it does fit your hands well, my other three fingers fall asleep cause i have nowhere to put them but its easy to just pause and move around. the screen lights up pretty well with no dark spots and is bright enough to play circle of the moon without problems. as far as durability goes, this thing is a champ. it fell five feet and didn't have a single scratch and still played like it did on the first day...so either thats quality or luck. if you are someone with alot of time and has the slightest bit of interest in gameboy, then go ahead and buy it. i guess i should add that i have the platinum sp. someone said before that they scratch easier but i haven't had any problem, just treat it like an adult...and forget i said i dropped it five feet.	1
After the original GBA was released, I found myself barely playing it thanks to the dismally dark screen and uncomfortable grip.  Even with a light (either snake light or magnified screen light) it was almost impossible to see.  And my hands would cramp quickly since the controls were just too close together for adult hands. The GBA SP is, in a word, incredible!  It fits my full-size hands perfectly.  The back light option makes it possible to play in the dark.  And the battery life is unbelievable.  While the one downside of a built-in rechargeable battery is the need to allow a full recharge before playing again, the game really does last for the 10 hours they say with the light on!  I turn off the light if I can when it's bright enough in the room, and this extends it even more.  I find myself charging it every three days or so overnight.  And if I want to continue playing it, I just turn it on with the charging cord attached! The flip design is wonderful.  It protects the screen when not in use, and the slight angle it provides when open makes this the most ergonomical of all the GBs ever made.  We did an inventory last night and realized we've had at least one of every Gameboy model ever released (color not withstanding of course)  We still have my wife's original grey/tan monster from the very first year.  I can honestly say without a doubt, Nintendo finally got the Gameboy just right!  I'm playing it more than any of the other versions, and not feeling any cramping in the hands or eye fatigue. I still feel the cost of the console itself is too high, but honestly, with the enjoyment it brings and the number of reasonably priced titles available, it pays for itself in entertainment value very quickly! Thank you, Nintendo!!	1
I had an original GBA and it was a great system, but when I heard the new GBA SP with the backlit display, I knew I had to get one.  When it release, I immediately purchased one. Not only the GBA SP smaller than the original GBA along with the backlit display, but the batteries are rechargeable and last a long time.  The SP is comfortable to use and the backlit is a god send since now you can enjoy it in any condition.  I like taking it to work or school with me during the slow times.  Along with all the great games, this is a must have product.  Props to Nintendo for making a great product even better.	1
When I was reading some of the press material for the Nokia N-Gage I found it interesting that Nokia representatives had been stating that they wanted to build a device that people would not be embarrassed to play in public. I laughed because I'm 23 and am more embarrassed by a cell phone than a hand held console. Not too much later Nintendo released the GBA SP, I don't know if it was because they wanted a sleeker design to pre-counter the inevitable whip lash of Nokia's "Gameboys' for little kids" tactics, but it wasn't a bad idea. Not that anyone was actually embarrassed by their GameBoy, but if they were there's no need to be now as Nintendo has finally designed the perfect handheld. Granted you can't make staticy and barely audible phone calls with it, but who cares? GBA still has the same great games it always has had, capable of playing all the old GameBoy and GameBoy color games in both wide screen and 4X3 mode, like the original GBA, and best of all, the screen is finally lit and can be played regardless of your lighting conditions, and there is an internal rechargeable battery that is fully charged in a matter of a couple hours. The battery will also last more than ten hours. Nintendo has eliminated many of the problems that I had with hand helds, the constant need for replacing batteries, and difficult to see LCD screens. Add to that a sleek new flip top design and a size that fits into your pocket better than ever I think that you have the perfect example of what an affordable and effective handheld should be, a game machine designed for on the go that you won't have to throw into a lake in frustration when your phone conversation cuts out on you. Not saying that the Nokia N-Gage won't sell, or won't have its own benefits, but rather that the GBA SP is a gamer's handheld, designed for gamers, by gamers and its not something I as a 23 year old gamer would ever be embarrassed to have in public, in fact I'm at work right now playing it and writing my review because its a pretty darn cool system. Now to finish off this battle in Tactic Ogre...	1
Simply Perfect. Since this device was targeted for kids, it's a little uncomfortable for grown-ups to play for a while without getting burning and joint pain in their hands, thats why you really neeed to browse Amazon.com for a set of grip extenders and add 'em to your cart along with the sp.	1
This Game Boy is the best yet. I tried my little cousin's GBA SP and I just had to have one. I got one within a few days of playing with my cousin's GBA SP. I got mine at [local store]for [money amount]+ tax. The lighting is very good. It is so much easier to see the screen. You can hold the screen a few feet from your eyes and still see the picture. It is light as a feather too, and it fits inside original GBA cases. If you love the GBA and play it a bunch I suggest buying the GBA SP. It is that good. It was worth every penny I spent on it. I did have the original GBA but when I got the GBA SP I traded in my original GBA at a local video trading store.	1
I previsly got a game boy advance for christmas and also (with it) came a set with a rechargable battery pack battery pack, light, and headphones. If the Game Boy Advance is $$$ and the set is $$$ just buy that. It works just fine for me and my aunt save 10 bucks. The SP isn't going to have seperet games for it so why bother? Save 10 bucks and by the Advance and the set.	-1
The Game Boy Advance SP (GBASP) is better than the Game Boy Advanced (GBA). There are many areas that GBASP excels in and only one where there is a trade-off (i.e., no negatives). Lighting. When we first got the GBA, we immediately had to get a good light to mount on it (80% of the ones on the market were hardly usable). Even then, it was difficult to see in some situations. Not to mention all the batteries were burned through with the add-on light. With GBASP, that is history. You can turn off the light, but you may find that you leave it on all the time. The lighting is obviously good in the dark, but it works impressively well in daylight (e.g., in the bright sun at 2pm at an open baseball stadium). This also makes the GBASP "cheaper" because you do not have to buy additional lighting units. Batteries. Since the GBASP uses an internal rechargeable battery, no more batteries to replace! There are adapters for car usage and the charge lasts quite a while, so not as big an issue as it may seem. Of course, not having heavy AA batteries also makes it smaller and lighter, not to mention cheaper. We figure that batteries alone will give a full pay-back of the unit within the first year. Weight. The GBASP is lighter than GBA and easy to notice the difference. A lot of this is due to using a lightweight rechargeable battery instead of heavy AA batteries. Also, the form factor lends itself to lighter weight by better use of space. Size. The size is great. Since it collapses and use space more efficiently, it easy fits in pants pockets and is more resistant to banging (the buttons end up being protected). Since the edges are smooth and flat, it also makes it easier to pack. Compatibility. Of course, the GBASP will play all GBA games and games that the GBA could play. This is always a big deal and this handles it well. The GBC cartridges stick out slightly (the GBA games are flush with the unit), but not more so than with the GBA unit itself. Sound. Although the sound may not be as loud as the GBA, this is often welcomed -- both for less power consumption and for less annoyance to others in the area who may not want to hear it (it does have an earphone jack). Overall, this is a big winner. It is no surprise that every toy store in this area is sold out of them. The only way we got one was because we bought it as a package that include a game that many people already have. Big winner and highly recommended.	1
This is a marvel of technology.  It is much easier than sitting at your computer you can play on the couch(in bed) or in the car(when not driving of course.)  The graphics are sharp and clear on old and new games and it has a very good back light(yes it does recharge and use the same battery as the system)  Anyone saying they would rather use the GBA(regular) because of the control layout is crazy!  This is the system to get. It is smaller(the screen is the same size though) it has backlighting and you don't have all of those messy little paraphnilia hanging out of your system like snake lights and bulky recharging packs like on the GBA(plain).  Do not let others disuade you from getting the SP because of some controls not being as wide or whatever.  If you get GBA, get SP!	1
I've owned all of the Gameboys and I've played this one more than all the others combined. The built-in screen makes a huge difference. And the built-in rechargeable battery takes a long time to run out. The folding feature is also great for carrying in your pocket. The only down side is that the smallness of it sometimes hurts my large hands after playing for a long time. If you have any other Gameboy, sell it and get this one.	1
I'm in love with my SP.  I'm relieved Nintendo elected to market to an older crowd again -- remember how your parents totally stole Duck Hunt from you when you were younger? -- which makes for a perfect gaming device when you're on a plane, train, or tube.  The frontlight makes everything look and feel so much better, and while the controls are slightly more cramped than a Game Boy Pocket's, I much prefer them to the prior GBA's.  Hott technology, woot woot.	1
I got my GBA SP last week after a long wait for one to become available.  I purchased the original GBA last year to take with me on a cross-continental flight.  I had never owned a portable system before.  I bought Golden Sun with it, and played through it over the course of my trip.  The Game was fantastic, and it really impressed me how much game-play could be squeezed out of such a little device.  After the trip, it collected dust, not because the game library didn't have anything to offer, but because the screen was so hard to see.  It is dark, and when dealing with trying to get the proper lighting conditions, glare on the screen can often be very distracting.  The SP with its built in light and re-chargable battery have single handedly renewed my interest in this platform.  I played Wario Land 4 on it, and had a fantastic time.  Yes it is not quite as comfortable to hold as the original, but the pros here far outweigh the cons.  An aspect that almost no reviewers have mentioned is that the buttons have changed... for the better.  The buttons are easier to press, specifically the directional pad. They click easier, and you don't have to press as hard.  The only button placement that is less helpful are those of the L and R shoulder buttons.  They are smaller and less easy to access, but don't let this discourage you.  The light and battery and foldable screen and easier D-pad, A and B button pressing are 4 pros. to the one con of more difficult L and R button access.  The extra money is well spent.  Trust me.	1
My first encounter with the new GBA SP was a case of 'love at first sight'.  The problems that I had with the old Game Boy Advance, mainly the need for a special light attachment and the excessive usage of batteries (and excessive cost of the same) appeared to have been solved by the new GBA SP.  Plugged into an outlet, one can play indefinitely.  The built-in light on the GBA SP is bright and the screen allows the most subtle details to be shown clearly.  My favourite game is the Two Towers: Lord of the Ring, and played on the old Game Boy Advance, many of the details could not be appreciated or even seen.  That is no longer the case.  The new GBA SP is well worth the cost as there no longer is a need to buy the triple A batteries that the light accessory for the old GBA used, nor the AA batteries that the GBA required.  In cost of battery replacement alone, one saves [several dollars] per week! The negative aspects of the new GBA SP only became apparent through use.  First of all, one still is unable to see the screen in sunlight, even when it is not direct sunlight.  There is a need for some sort of shield or 'hood' for the machine, to block out sunlight so that one can play comfortably outside or on a coach, train or in an automobile.  The second problem is the size of the controls.  They are smaller than the old GBA and although this does not matter when playing a game like the Two Towers game, it does make a difference when playing one of the older games like the Jackie Chan game.  I have found that it is easier to use the old GBA to play the Jackie Chan game, and that is a pity, because that means that one goes back to endless battery purchases and replacements...  The sleek, compact size of the new GBA SP is wonderful, but the sacrifice in terms of the size of the controls is fairly significant where certain games are concerned. The benefits far outweigh the problems I have found in using the new GBA SP, and I recommend it to any one, and most especially to those who play detailed games like the Two Towers game.  One actually can SEE the crebain clearly from a distance and take measures accordingly.  Moreover, the beauty of some of the scenes in the game is breathtaking, and only with the new GBA SP was I finally able to fully appreciate the talent and care lavished upon this game.	1
[Note:  Functionally there's no difference between the Platinum and Cobalt (blue) versions.] The new GBA SP is incredibly light in weight, and it lights up the 2.8-inch LCD screen with a built-in sidelight (a.k.a. frontlight).  I wish Nintendo had included backlight for lighting that's more even and bright, but at least this time they got it right; the original Game Boys were just awful eye-killers.  Finally I can get to play Castlevania and enjoy the graphics, too. Many people complain about the reduced L and R buttons.  They are indeed more awkward than on the original GBA, but unless you have real large hands, there shouldn't be a problem getting used to the new layout.  Long-term, though, one wonders what negative effect it has on the human hands; already, our thumbs and other digits are over-exerted from punching on cell phones, console controllers, holding mice and trackballs, and now tapping furiously on small buttons on the GBA SP.  Do your body a favor and take lots of breaks.  Rub your fingers gently.  You'll thank this preacher later!	1
Looks like after a decade the corporation of nintendo had the guts to spend enough money for us not to spend money on any more accessories for the game boy cause this one has it all in one little piece of silicon and plastic. I used to be a fan of game boy but from the bad screen (not being able to play in the dark!)and stuffing it with batteries I was one of the...that got SEGA GAME GEAR instead. Remember Game Gear? Anyways this is a perfect little machine to play games you never thought you would be able to play handheld or in the dark or for a long time since there is a built in ligh-up screen and is rechargeable so you never , ever have to put one single battery in it! I think that is as state of the art as you can get!	1
Without question, this is the greatest handheld ever invented. Here's why: 1. it has a front-lit screen, which makes it very easy to see in any lighting condition, and it evenly lights up the screen with a whiteish-blue glow, sort of like a light in a watch 2. It is small and is easy to take around with you wherever you go, and is a lot easier to hold, but it takes a little time to get used to the different shape and size if you have large hands. 3. The lithium rechargeable battery that is included keeps the game boy powered for about 10 hours with the light off, and 18 hours with the light off, and can be recharged more than 15 times before you need to buy a new one. Also, the AC adapter included is pretty small, and can be taken with you anywhere, and the prongs that go into the outlet can be pushed into the adapter itself to reduce its size. In the long-run, you will most likely earn back all the money that you paid for the SP, because you will no longer need to buy expensive lights and batteries, until the rechargeable battery dies. You should definitely buy this little guy, even if you already have a game boy advance... it's worth it, and you'll probably get your money back in a few months cuz you don't have to buy any more batteries. When i tried to buy my game boy advance SP, it was sold out everywhere, Toys R us is the only place where i could find it... and you can sell your old game boy advance for a LOT of money, (i sold mine for like 70 dollars with 2 games and my light). or, you could give it to your dog... after all, dogs are nature's way of telling we could have been worse off... Anyway, you should DEFINITELY by this game boy... its the best! P.S. I've been wondering this since the day it came out... what does 'SP' stand for?	1
Im glad i waited and did not buy the original Game Boy advance, because this version is far superior.  With the light built in, and the filp screen, resulting in a very small size, i couldn't ask for much more in a portable system.  Plus it plays ALL game boy games... don't hesitate to buy.	1
Gameboy Advance lovers are in for a wonderful treat. The new Gameboy Advance SP is truly a blessing. The console itself is even more portable than before when folded closed in its clamshell design and looks slick when opened for playing, like a PDA or a mini-laptop. The console is much more comfortable to hold and the control pad and A/B buttons are much easier to access than on the original Gameboy Advance. The screen is about the same size as the original GBA. The L & R shoulder buttons are smaller and not as easy to reach, especially if you have slightly larger hands, but are acceptable considering the SP's most popular feature. The backlight is truly the best. Most of my playing is at night and I am euphoric over finally being able to play without holding the console under a lamp or the glaring ceiling light. The SP also comes with a fantastic AC adapter; the prior GBA's adapter was sold separately, and looks similar, except the new included adapter plugs effortlessly in the unit and also recharges the lithium-ion battery. The documentation doesn't stress that you can use the AC adapter to also power the unit, but you can, according to Nintendo. They also stated that whenever the lithium-ion battery needs replacement, Nintendo sells them for a small price and is user replaceable. The replacement cost is minimal compared to how many batteries you would buy to replace on the prior GBA console. Games on the SP are much more enjoyable to play and the controls are more responsive. The sound is somewhat louder, but a slightly audible hiss is present, though this is not too distracting. The placement of the speaker is a bit inconvenient; it's easy to move a thumb over it and muffle the sound, but this too is minor. E-reader users will find a slight problem; the E-reader plugged in the SP sticks out towards you in a somewhat ungainly fashion and the socket that normally plugged in the GBA's link cable port is a bit close to the SP's Select button making it only a little awkward to press. This too, is minor, considering how fantastic the GBA SP is. It is too bad that the SP wasn't made first, its sturdiness, wonderful design and the much needed backlight puts us that much closer to portable gaming perfection.	1
The original Gameboy Advance is the best handheld ever released, without question. But it had obvious shortcomings, the main one being that, as with any system, you can't please everyone. What is a plus to one person is a minus to another. With that in mind, the Gamebody Advance SP sets the standard for handheld systems with it's unique and intuitive design. The most obvious improvement is the backlight, which can be turned on and off. It evenly and brightly lights up the screen, making the games playable under any condition. My biggest qualm with the original model was the fact that a light was not an option, and all the light peripherals (like the "UFO" light) were garbage. The SP is crisp, clear, and makes gameplay less taxing, especially on darker games like Castlevania and Metroid Fusion. My favorite improvement, by far, is the folding design. My older GBA (glacier) got more than a few dings and scratches on the screen, just by general use and abuse in my bag. The SP folds neatly, thus protecting the screen. The keypad is still the same, but it can be cumbersome on the first play, since all the buttons are together below the screen, instead of either side. Also adding value is the rechargable battery, which will save gamers loads on replacements everytime the battery runs low. It takes a while to charge, but it provides more than enough time to enjoy your games in one sitting. The flaws are minor at the worst of times. The biggest one being the lack of a headphone jack, which is bad considering that I have always enjoyed the nastalgic SNES music. The long charging time is also a flaw, but not enough to make it a big inconvenience. Overall, the flaws are few and far between. I bought the GBA SP the first day it came out, and I couldn't be happier with it. I can now play anywhere, at any time, without squinting my eyes, or tilting in order to see better. It was a great idea from Nintendo, and the SP will likely be the standard by which all handheld systems will be judged in the future.	1
I like SP a lot better than the older version! my sister has the older pink GBA, and it's a pain, the light she bought for it never stays on, and it's larger and harder to see the screen. For the likes: Small laptop design, feels newer and better. Screen has a light that you can turn on and off. Rechargable battery saves money, just plug in the power cable, even play while charging! Screen has more protection. Can still use attachments like GameCube cable. For the dislikes: Slightly more delicate, do not want to drop! (wouldn't want to with eiter kind) Can over time take a toll on your hands, so don't play for hours on end, just a 20 minute break will do. Overall a LOT better than your average GBA, that's why they made it, a update for those who don't like the old GBA. I'm happy with mine! I'm sure you will be too ;)	1
First, let me say that this game boy is the same game boy advance in terms of electronics--same chip, same screen, etc.  The big differences are the following: 1.  Lighted screen.  Yes, you read that correctly, you can actually now play your gameboy without having a 100 Watt lamp right next to it!  It is not true backlighting, but is more than adequate and functions well. 2.  Rechargeable batteries.  Lithium Ion batteries mean that you no longer will spend money on AA's, but rather plug in your gameboy with the included charger. 3.  Sleek, portable design.  I love the new PDA type design, but some may not.  I appreciate the folding screen, which is a neat way to prevent scratches and the like. This gameboy may not be for all, especially if you already own an Advance, but it is a great little unit.	1
I was a bit wary of buying this game because of the negative reviews. But I had just bought a new computer with a good graphics card, and I had heard that this game "looks good." It was also very cheap. I'm a pretty harsh critic of games in general, and I have a very low tolerance for buggy software. I have not yet played this all the way through, but so far (after several hours of play) I am finding it fun, with pretty good graphics, and I have not encountered any bugs at all. The story is ok if sometimes a bit dopey. In the future, the world is controlled by the evil "Grathius Corporation," sort of a hybrid between Microsoft and Genentech. Naturally, you are the leader of the freedom fighters, a band of rebels that seems to be composed mainly of young heavily armed women wearing miniskirts and lingerie. It's not quite Victoria's Secret with guns but it is close in a couple of places. I think that one secret to success with this game is to get the latest patch. A lot of the earlier reviews mention bugginess and poor AI. With the 390 patch, I have not encountered any bugs, and I would say the AI behavior is acceptable if not spectacular. Your enemies will retreat when they have been hit, use cover, fire down on you from above, etc. They become tougher and more intelligent the farther you go in the game. The reason that I give this game 4 stars instead of 5 is that the gameplay is entirely linear. First you do A, then you do B, then you do C. There is no flexibility about accomplishing the tasks. In addition, you have a "GPS" that always points you toward your next objective. The combination of the linear game play and the GPS sometimes creates a feeling that you are trapped in a maze with not much control of what is happening. Had the game been designed with more flexibility, it would be truly awesome. As it is, it is an entertaining FPS with a generally satisfying assortment of weapons, teammates, explosives, and missions.	1
I have rarely, if ever, played a first-person shooter this bug-ridden, and that's too bad since the actual gameplay, while it's nothing original, is pretty good (even if the plot is seriously lacking). But you can only find so much enjoyment from a game that kicks you to your desktop whenever it feels the urge, or forces you to endure horrendous scenery glitches. What could have been one of the year's sleeper hits in the genre is wounded by its own severe lack of polish, despite all its beautiful graphics, realistic physics, and its awesome assortment of weapons. Out of the box, "Devastation" is devastating, and you, as a gamer, should never have to pay to beta test. Wait for the next genre offering to come along instead - there are plenty looming on the horizon.	-1
I have owned all the gameboys that have been released in the USA. I have to say that is the best one of all. Oviously the hardware is the best compared to the orignal Gameboy, but I was speaking about the time it was launched. The SP is equiped with the best hardware, games, a built in front light, and a built in rechargeable Li-ion battery. The light is awesome!!! Even in good lighting, I bet you will still prefer to have the light on. I llove the new compact size. Although it is comfortable in your hands for a little while, after time your hands may get cramped. Overall I say that the SP is good terms of games, since the games are the same as the other Advance. The only bad thing about the system is the price. Although you get what you pay for here.	1
When you're deciding whether or not to buy a GBA SP you have to ask yourself one question:  Is it worth shelling 100 dollars for a GBA with a new shape, front light, and rechargable battery?  If your answer is yes, then get this one immediately.  Keep in mind there are no special games made for SPs only.  It has the same graphical technology as the original GBA.	1
I got my hands on the new GBA SP this afternoon and I am amazed at how much I really like the little thing.  I was a bit unsure if I wanted to buy this one, as I already had the standard GBA along with the rest of the GB family, but I have to say this is by far worth it for me. First off, the design is great, it real feels like a GB again and it is really lightweight.  The backlighting option is nice, and you can turn it off and on via a button on the front, for those worried about battery life.  GBA games fit nicely into the front of the unit, I have not tried it yet with any older GB games, but they will stick out of the front (bottom) so this may not be optimal, but it will work. Other positves included the folding design which protects the screen and a nice charge light that lets you know when the unit needs charging. It is missing the headphone jack, which would be nice, esp. when dealing with kids that may want to play this in the car, etc.  The volume is adjustable on the side.  The unit is also a lot more "plasticy" than it looks in pictures.  It is something I noticed when I first opened the box but does not seem to be an issue (for me) any longer.  This is what helps keep the overall weight of the unit down. The only thing that set me back upon first using the unit was the required first charge before using, keep this in mind as it is not ready to go out of the box.  The charge time for me was only a couple of hours though, so that was livable. If you don't currently own a GBA, this is the one to buy.  If you do currently own one, this may not be worth the expense, unless you are really into GB, like I am.	1
The GBA SP is a great evolution in the gameboy line.  Three things make this a winner.  Fist, the light.  Finally you can play the gameboy in the dark.  The light does give a bit of a blue/white tint to the screen when active, but it's not a real problem.  Being able to play without having to be in direct sunlight or under a good lamp is such a great thing, and worthy of the upgrade by itself. The second great thing is the size.  This guy is tiny!  When you flip the screen out, which can stop anywhere along the arc, it is almost ths size of the game boy pocket.  The controls feel very solid and responsive.  Originally I thought I would have a problem with this, since I have big hands, but it feels nice.  Finally you can have a really pocket sized gameboy.  The folding screen is great too, as you will protect the screen from scratches. The last great feature is the battery.  By using a side lighting feature instead of a backlit screen, you can really get 10 hours of play using the light the whole time.  Supposedly you get 18 hours of battery life without the light, but you'll be using the light most of the time.  It takes about 3 hours to fully charge the battery. In summary, this is a fantastic update.  Sell your old GBA, or give it to a friend, and pick this up pronto.  I love the SP!	1
I own TWO Gameboy Advance, and still own an N64, I am very positive about purchasing a Gamecube this Christmas.  But so far, when it comes to the new Gameboy Advance SP, I don't like it and won't buy it.  I mean it, I never bought the original Gameboy cause I hated it (even the color one).  Just when I thought they had a better idea when it comes to design (with the Gameboy Advance) they go back and mess up.  Instead of going upward they're going downward!  Ok, they made it look like a laptop computer now; but why would they? (just for looks if you ask me)!  they could have put a light on the BG Advance design for $20 extra instead NOW you have to pay 100+ more!.  Gee!  I'd rather buy a third party light. The only Gameboy that I've played is the Advance because, while I am a woman, I have medium-large size hands.  The whole thing has been designed for tiny hands and while I have two small children, the Gameboy Advance design was definitely best for all of us.  Using the original gameboy my hands would ache at about 10 minutes of gameplay!  With the Gameboy Advance I could last about 30+ minutes, though eventually I had to purchase an Intec accessory to accomodate, and my hands don't hurt anymore at all (up to an hour straight of play)!  and the kids don't seem to mind.  So Why would they go back and make the old aching design???  It doesn't look any cuter either, it's just a design that have been used by other companies and they just copied it.  I thought the next Gameboy would be like a smaller version of the Nintendo 64 controller design (maybe not as big as the Intec Blast & Rumble adapter I've been using) but something in that direction. Have the Nintendo people EVER sit to play for ONE hour with a Gameboy (all of them, specially the new one)??  They're trying to make people do what they wouldn't do themselves! Nintendo if you ever read this I want you to know in advance that I won't buy it, I'd rather buy a game device from another manufacturer, thanks!	1
I bought a Game Boy Advance SP imported from Japan and have been using it for almost 2 weeks now. How did I ever play these games without a lighted screen? The ritual with my standard GBA was, find a decent light source, and sit under it, back straight, craning my neck downward the whole time. As a result, I never played for very long. But with the SP's front light, you can play anywhere, in any position. That alone is worth the price of this machine. But the flip-screen design is also a major bonus. It'll keep the screen safe when the system's not in use. Also, the rechargeable battery is far more convenient than having to exchange AAs when you need fresh juice. Just keep the light turned off when you have good lighting to play under, and the battery will keep you going for a good 12 hours. One thing to be wary of if you buy the Platinum unit (not sure about the Cobalt): the silver paint comes off relatively easily if you subject the GBA SP to rough handling, so get a carrying case for it. Other than that, I can't find a single fault with this game system. If you already own a GBA without an Afterburner installed, buy the SP. If you've never owned a Gameboy before, this is the time to jump in. You get a sleek, sophisticated unit and a library of great games to play on the go.	1
This game boy comes with a built in lightwith a light switch,well thats good news,but The Game Boy Advance SP is a lott smaller then the standard Game Boy Advance and can fold up like a tinylaptop computer when not being played. And it doesnt use any standard batteries,the Game Boy Advance SP needs to charge like a regular cell phone with an AC adapter. A Lithium ion battery is built in and cannot be removed or replaced. Nintendo claims that with 3 hours of charging equals 10 hours of play or 18 if you don't use the light.but the AC adapter can be used as a regular power source so you can play the Game Boy  Advance SP can be played while plugged into the wall. The Game Boy Advance SP will have the standard D-pad ,A and B buttons plus START and SELECT.The L and R buttons are smaller and are placed behind the flip top screen. A new Front Light Screen (FLS) button has been added just under the display that functions as the off/on switch for the light. A new sliding volume switch is located on the right side. Games will be inserted from the bottum of the unit instead of from the top like the regular Game Boy Advance and the original. In addition the Game Boy Advance games,the Game Boy Advance SP will also support old and new Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. The games with the built in sensors like Kirby's Tilt'N'Tumble may not work  properly with this unit  because  the cartridge would be flipped upside down during play. The new Game Boy Advance SP screen is the same exact size as the regular Game Boy Advance screen. The Game Boy Advance SP will come with a AC adapter and headphone adapter. The headphone adapter will be required for any regular headphone set since the Game Boy Advance SP doesnt have a mini-plug input. In fact the headphone adapter uses the  same port as the AC adapter ,so using headphones while the unit is  plugged into the AC adapter would be impossible. Another concern is that Nintendo is still struggling  to come up with with a solution for consumers if their internal Lithium ion battery  dies from overuse. Three colors are offered in Japan:cobalt,platinum,and black. But in the U.S. only two colors are offered:cobalt and platinum. In the U.S. the Game Boy Advance SP will be available ... on March 23one day before the release of the game The Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker for the Gamecube. THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVIEW ON THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SP..............	1
Games like Castlevania: Circle of the Moon are practically invisible on the original Game Boy Advance.  You cannot get sufficient lighting to play them on an airplane, let alone in a car at night. Got that, parents?  The original Game Boy Advance is useless as a babysitter in a dark car. Game Boy Advance-SP has a light in it.  It als has everything else a handheld game system needs to be great. In order to be great, a handheld game system needs a simple interface, a good enough screen, and sufficient library. Above all, it needs good battery life. Take away any one of these components and you have a formula for failure. The screen on Game Boy Advance-SP is not bright in the way that Game Gear and Lynx was bright. You can't read a book with the glare coming off of its screen. But combined with the reflective material behind the screen, SP is bright enough to be clear. You would not want it to be any brighter, not at the cost of battery life. My Nomad can chew its way through 6 AA batteries in under two hours. With SP, I can easily nurse 10 hours of game and light use out of built-in rechargeable batteries. That's enough juice to fly from San Francisco to Tokyo. It's a round trip to Hawaii. If I have a complaint about Game Boy, it's the quality of the software. Sure, I love playing Tetris DX. Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World is an amazing game, and Metroid Fusion is great, but few companies seem to understand the system. Lets face it, wrestling games stink on Game Boy. Mortal Kombat Advance was about as bad as games get. Don't even think about the GBA version of Defender. Enix's Dragon Quest III, which was made for GB Color, is a great RPG. In fact, I like a bunch of the old classics, like the first Contra for Game Boy. Capcom did a GREAT job with Street Fighter Alpha 3. Thanks to the new light, I can finally appreciate Konami's amazing new Castlevania games--Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance. These wonderful games always had great gameplay, but they are dark--so dark that monsters sometimes snuck up on me... so dark that I could never appreciate the detailed graphics.	1
I just bought a GBA a month ago. I figured when I bought it that I would be able to SEE the game I was playing. Silly me. Now I hear GBA SP is coming out and it has a light. I can't return the GBA I just got back to the store so I'm stuck with an inferior product...	-1
We'll, I've been playing Game Boy's and their games since the original came out, but I've persounally never bought one myself (friends, relatives, brothers and sisters have though).  Why?  Because I COULDN'T see the screen!  It got to a point where in broad daylight, riding in the car, I'd need to turn on the snake light to see (which causes a glare itself).  It's always had great games, great graphics, and great sound.  But the problem is, it's always been difficult to play all of those awsome games on the Game Boy Systems.  Well, the new and improved GameBoy Advance SP, replacing the less than 2-year old GBA (GameBoy Advance), is a HUGE improvement for one simple reason.  Here's a sort of preview of Nintendo's latest GameBoy: Facts: The GameBoy SP is the most sophisticated and stylish handheld system ever to be released.  It has a folding screen, and when folded, is smaller than even the current Game Boy Advance, and claims to fit "perfectly" into one's pocket.  The system itself is powered by a battery, which has ten hours of gameplay and is rechargable, taking only 3 hours to recharge. What else is new?  It has a frontlight, making it possible too *gasp* see the screen!  It makes all the colors and details hard to usually make out in past GameBoy games crystal clear on your screen, so u can play it anywhere, anytime.  Even at night in a pitch black room!  You don't need to use endless batteries anymore, as the GBA: SP recharges itself after 3 hours for 10 whole hours of fresh use (this includes using the light).  When the screen is turned OFF (light), the battery lasts an additional 8 hours, meaning u can play your GBA: SP without tripple AAA batteries for up 18 hours after it's recharged.  That's a HUGE improvement! The GameBoy Advance: SP plays all Game Boy games ever made, so u can trade in all of your GameBoy systems and play all of your favorite games (including Pocket, Color, and of course, Advance GameBoys) on the same system, NOW WITH LIGHT.  See why u have to get this!? 1) The system is actually smaller than the GBA, and fits perfectly into your pocket. 2) You can play thousands of games on the GameBoy Advance: SP.  Every GameBoy game ever made works on this sytem.  It's time to get the old Mario's and Zelda's and Pokemons's out! 3) It will be released in 2 colors ONLY at launch: Platinum and Cobalt. 4) The system features a front light (so u can now c your games), and a built in battery.  So u can play for up to 10 hours with the front light, then recharge at the hotel, and play for 10 hours on the trip the next day. Well, this is the FIRST Game Boy system I've actually counsidered buying.  No batteries, a front light, and u can play all those games u were playing 8 years ago.  Could it get any better? Well, I hope I gave u a few facts, and proved to you that NO, this is not another GameBoy, or even just an add-on from GameBoy Advance.  This is a new and improved GameBoy people, and will be available everywhere March 23, 2003 (North America only). (Notes: The GameBoy Advance will NOT be discontinued, but will continue to be manufactered and sold by Nintendo.  Don't worry GBA owners, you can still play and buy your GBA games. Oh, one more thing.  Game Boy Advance: (SP) (stands for *Special Project*).) Thx!	1
The Game Boy Advance SP is the latest new hardware from Nintendo. This portable gaming system has the exact same inside parts as the original GBA, it is simply redesigned to fit the GBA SP's more compact shape. This reincarnation of the Game Boy was developed to help Nintendo capture the audience of older gamers and also to better compete with the new cell phones that have games on them. The letters "SP" in the name stand for "special." The GBA SP is noticeably smaller than its predecessor. It is just over 3x3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. It is made up of two hinged panels, with the top part being the screen and the bottom part being the standard buttons (the design is similiar to a laptop computer--only smaller). The LCD screen part does not hinge or snap shut, but it is sturdy and does not shake or move when you are playing. The LCD screen is the same size as the original GBA's. The cartridge goes in on the bottom part of the front of the unit. The L and R buttons are still there, but smaller and are located on the back edge behind the other buttons. The GBA SP comes in the colors platinum and cobalt (metallic blue). The GBA SP is compatible with almost all existing Game Boy games (including GB Pocket, GB Color, GBA, etc.). Unfortunately, because of the way the game cartridge is inserted upside-down, tilt-sensor games, such as Kirby's Tilt-n-Tumble, will not function properly on the GBA SP. However, rumble games, such as Pokemon Pinball, do indeed work. Also, all existing accessories will work for this product, including the Card-e reader, the Gamecube link cable, and AC adapters. Instead of two AA batteries, the system uses its own built in lithium-ion battery which Nintendo claims will last 18 hours (10 hours with the light on). Yes, that's right! The GBA SP has a light on it, which may be the best reason to upgrade. The LCD part of the unit is lighted, allowing you to finally play in low or no light! The screen is lit evenly from all sides, making it look even better than a GBA with an Afterburner installed. The light turns on and off with a button above the controls. The specs are the same as the GBA, but in case you don't know them, here are the basic ones: -32-bit processor w/embedded memory -display approx. 41x61 mm -resolution 240x160 pixels -over 32,000 colors displayed simulaneously In conclusion, I would highly recommend this product, especially if you do not own a Game Boy Advance. This product is targeted at new older-aged gamers, but even if you own a GBA, the [money] might not be a big price to pay for the cool new design, smaller size, and lighted screen.	1
I got to see and hold a Game Boy Advance SP while at CES.  I have also seen an after market device for the regular GBA called the Afterburner that adds side light.  The Afterburner voids any warranty with Nintendo and also it seems to only light from the top.  Also you might need a degree in Electrical Engineering because it requires some soldering, that or find a place on line that will do the modification for a fee.  The new Advance SP lights from all four directions, also it did not seem to have a blue cast that the Afterburner is famous for; the GBA SP did not have this problem!  The Advance SP fits like a dream in my hands, but I have small hands.  Other reviews have mentioned that it felt good to hold.  It reminds me of a Game Boy Color cut in half and folded over.  Both me and my wife are in our 30s, we both have GBAs because we tend to travel a lot.  I feel the new SP will attract more adults, it did not have a toy look but more of that of like a cell phone or PDA.  I look forward to getting one!!!	1
This is the game of the year. Big words, yes, but very true. If you didn't believe me let me inform of these great things they included inside this game. The actors and actresses' real voices, over an hour of original full-motion video made exucluisly for the game, you know kung-fu like Neo, an original story written by the great Wachoscki brothers, Andy and Larry, and great A.I. In the immortal words of Neo..."Whoa." Oh yeah and an ingenious hacking game. ... One bad thing I regret to say the devolpers have failed to do is let you control your favorite character from the original Matrix film such as Neo, Trinity, or Morpheous. But you play as Niobe or Ghost whose missions differ from each other. For an example, Niobe drives a car through heavy traffic to find the nearest telephone to escape the Matrix while Ghost provides backup with artillity to shoot agents and the police. As you can tell the brothers took a long time to make this game. Once this game hits the market the way we look at movie-inspired games will change such as when the Matrix made us look at sci-fi movies differently. Tomorrow, I'll be sitting in the Matrix theater and than going to my house to play the game to complete the plot. Thank you Atari, Wachoski brothers, all the actors and actresses, Warner Bros., and the executive producer who passed the producter. My final grade:A+.	1
There is little doubt that this is going to be one of the top games of 2003. The December 2002 Game Informer Magazine gave this a full-length feature, and it left little doubt that this is going to be a powerhouse game. Enter the Matrix is being developed with a close collaborative effort between gaming industry and Hollywood so that they can create a game experience "as rewarding as the movie." There will be ultra-realistic character movements with the over 4,000 motion captures performed and encoded into the game. We are promised over 200 minutes of in-game cinematics and voices from the actors of the film including Keanu Reeves (bless his heart). You can play as Niobe or Ghost, and you play along side characters from the first movie (Neo and Morpeus). Screen shots look promising with plenty of special effects. Unless the something goes terribly wrong between now and the release of this game, we can expect ONE AWESOME GAME!	1
The Matrix (All three of them) were excellent movies, with the main character as NEO!!  However, in this you are Ghost or Niobe, who are just as excellent.  With a few cheats after you beat the game (try not to use them before the game is beaten, it takes out all of the fun), you can have the time of your real life, with unlimited focus or ammunition, or a sword, it gets extremely interesting.  My only compliant is no NEO.	1
This is really awesome, you couldn't take me away from it. Much better bullet time than I thought! Real gamers shouldn't care about graphics, they should just be considered the cherry on top, but they're still great! Sounds don't matter either, but they're great to have, especially when you break necks! But, to make this short and sweet, this game is great!!!!!	1
I'm sure I'm not the only one that's been waiting for a matrix game since the original matrix. Well now It's Here, And It's Great. Gameplay 9/10 Wow, this game has driving, fighting, shooting, and it's all done amazingly well. My only problem is that 1/3 of each character's missions are the same. And you can use your focus, it slows everything down, and you can do crazy things just like in the movies. In Game Graphics 8/10 Good graphics everything is done well what more can I say. CGI Cut Scenes 4/10 What is this! The Computer Generated Cut Scenes SUCK. This is the worst thing I've seen in a long time, the original super mario bros. graphics were better (almost). Live Action Cut Scenes 10/10 That's right, this baby has 1 hour of game exclusive dvd quality cut scenes. Simply amazing, and it doesn't feel wierd going from live action straight to computer animated. Wonderful. Sound 8/10 Good sound effects, good soundtrack. Just goo all around. And the music timing is perfect. Replay Value 8/10 The driving levels are fun no matter how many times you play them, plus ounce you beat the game, you can go through ALOT OF HACKING to get a sword, It takes forever but it's worth it. And there's a hacking code to give you a multiplayer mode, but it's not that great, you can play as morpheus, agent smith, trinity, a police car(it's really funny the car stands on it's back tires and punches with its front ones) and more. Great Replay Value. Overall 9/10 If you're a matrix fan or a fan of driving shooting or fighting games, get this. And for $20, You can't go wrong.	1
As you probably already know, Enter the Matrix is a movie liscensed game based off of The Matrix Reloaded. Many people who saw the movie were dissapointed because it was much worse than the first one. But, the game somewhat makes up for it. First off, I realize that many reviews from magazines and such have not been giving this game great reviews. This is because there are a lot of technical difficulties with this game, including it being short, having graphical problems, controls being fustrating at times, and there are a few glitches in gameplay. However, this game is great nonetheless. Enter the Matrix is a fun-filled action game with a lot of replay value (there are two different characters you could play as). This game is purely action. Between driving cars and ships, shooting from turrets and cars, shooting with guns on the ground, and just plain awesome fighting, this game has a variety of different gameplay. It also has a fantastic story line if you like The Matrix series because it fills in many gaps in The Matrix Reloaded. Enter the Matrix is a definite game worth owning for all action and Matrix fans. Just a few technical glitches keep this game from getting a perfect score.	1
Enter the Matrix sounded like it was going to be one of the best entries into the GameCube's library of games this year, with its unprecedented level of tie-in with the movies and its promise to bring the Matrix's unique style of fighting to the major game systems--but it ultimately fails to deliver. For the first hour or so, out of the six or seven it will take you to complete _both_ scenarios, you will think 'wow, this is great,' but the remainder of the game is exactly the same, and there is very little extra to do. Hacking is an interesting but too-short addition, and the meager multiplayer is laughable. So, rent it, but don't buy it. The sense of novelty doesn't last.	1
I rented Enter The Matrix after I saw The Matrix Reloaded in theatres, and then a few months later i bought it. It's a really fun game, being able to do "bullet-time" and all, but it's too damn short!! You can do so much in this game, like beat the stuffing out of guys, throw them across the room, shoot them while doing backflips and running on walls, drive cars and blow up cop cars, fight agents (which is awesome!) and even shoot Sentinels in the spaceship underground. But after I finished the sentinel level, the credits started running! I was like "what the-"...and then..it was over! It was fun while it lasted, but...now what?? But even if you finish the game early, it won't sit on your shelf and collect dust, because at the start you get to pick either Niobe or Ghost, and since I finished with Niobe first, I still had to play the game as Ghost, which made my happy. They have some of the same levels, but most of them are different. Hacking mode is also fun too, where you get to chat with people, and unlock weapons, characters and secret training levels, and even a multiplayer mode! But the only downside in this gamw besides its length is NEO IS BARELY IN IT!! It would be awesome to play as him, but he isn't even in the movies between the levels and stuff! It would pay extra money for this game if the put in Neo V.S. 100 Agent Smiths, like in Matrix Reloaded. Anyways, if you like The Matrix, buy this now. If not, stay away. Far away.	1
This is an awsome game, with tight bullet-time effects and a half-way decent replay value. I found it easy with Niobe, but Ghost's levels get harder. But the hardest part is...hacking. Yes, you can use a 'hacking program' to unlock character, weapon, and car bios, drop weapons into levels, activate cheat codes, unlock multiplayer battles (Like a cool Agent Smith Vs. Morphius one), and even get a sword for melee combat. But be careful, it can be frustrating. You just solve the puzzle of a lifetime, then trackers get to you and you lose all your hacking data. Great. Still, it's really fun.	1
I wanted more out of Enter the Matrix. Not some simple kiddie game rated T for no reason. I awaited for this game in the GR (game-revolution, where I work) mail box so I could snag it! But I snagged [stuff]. The game runs level based, like usual, and gives you two options for players, Ghost or Niobe. They each have the same missions except for car parts. Any way, the graphics are poor for the GCN. The focus button is the only cool part of the game. The like of different fighting skills is making the game boring. You don't even get to keep your guns every level. They should look at Turok: Evolution for help with that. All the missions sound hard, but tend to be too easy even on hard! Shooting people or beating the [stuff] out of them is cool, but lacks. Some enemies even get stuck in the wall. Ghost got stuck in the wall! That is weird! To die, just stand there and throw grenades at the ground! You can't die because the S.W.A.T. can't shoot! Well, have fun watching wour mash of polygons run around. Scare you later!	-1
Was very happy with the original Blitzkrieg!  It's fun, playable, easy to learn, and usually different each time.  Sometimes it seems that the missions are too scripted, but overall, it was a lot of fun.  Also ran well with few glitches.  Still better than Sudden Strike 3!	1
This is a short review for the developers of this game: the historical accuracy & accurate detail up to the lowest level put this game in the category of "hobby" as opposed to "toy for children". Personally I prefer to take decicions on national level myself (see: Medieval: Total War) instead of receiving "orders" (the "campaign" & "mission" system) but then obviously you loose some histrical accuracy. Good work, congrats.	1
This game is pretty decent. When I first played it, I unistalled the game after playing it for about 10 minutes because it was impossible for me to beat the first few missions. It is very different from other RTS games such as Starcraft, Warcraft, and Age of Empires. Unlike those RTS games this games this game is not simple and it might take a while to get better or get used to the gameplay. I have only played it about a month now so I am still a noob at this game but single player is still pretty fun. The first thing that reminded of me was the Combat Mission games which made me think that Blitzkrieg was more of a TBS game than RTS. It is RTS, however, it is very similar to Combat Mission if you played it before. The units move slowly in groups and the setting is in WWII. Also, the sound is very realistic. The requirements is one thing that you don't have to worry about. If you have read all my reviews, you know that I own whole mess of PCs. But instead of using my newer PCs, I used the oldest PC that I had for about 4 years which the system specifications are Celeron 900mhz, 256mb ram, GeForce 2 and ran it on 1024x768x32, a medium resolution, without any slowdowns. So, any people can play this game with a dated PC which shouldn't go below Pentium 2 400mhz, 128mb ram, and 16mb video card. It is not the official requirements but my requirements are little higher which will make the game run a little better. If you are a quick learner or if you have played all types of RTS and TBS games, this game is definitly for you. Also if you are a WWII buff, this game might be also for you. But if you aren't satisfied with my review, then it is safer bet that you try the demo from fileplanet.com, gamershell.com, or filefront.com.	1
At the begining you pick either Ghost or Niobe to play through the story as. One of my favorite things is that, after you get use to all the normal fighting moves and shooting stuff, you still have the Focus button to play with. Focusing bends the rules of the matrix and gives you character super human speed and strenght, for a limited time. Your focus and Health recharge if you stand still for a moment, which is cool. Plus, There's exclusive footage filmed for the game only, which replaces a lot of what would be Computer animated CutScenes, but not all. Now, I could go on, but I wouldn't want to anger those of you that like to go into a video game blind, skiping all cutscenes, to get to the game and play on hard-mode, and not have a clue why your doing what your doing. If you aren't one of those people, please read the strategy guide. It has a lot of useful info, especialy on the Hacking System... This is one wonderful game that any gamer should get. I'll have to break it down because I don't know how to say everything in a comment. * Graphics - The characters are rendered to look compleatly real, but corners where cut when it comes to some of the less used environments, are blocky or bland. * Sound - Rich and loud, but it can get tiring as there's only two musics for each type of level. The cool thing about this is that when there are no threats the music rebeverts to the softer part of the Matrix Song, but when enemies a flawless trasistion into the louder Matix Music that makes your heart pound. And there's a seperate song and change in the other types of levels too. The Music in the first driving level is amazing when it switches to a rock and roll style when the Police Crusers pop up. * GamePlay - Amazing in the way that it encompasses fighting, exploration, shooting, and all those into one experince. From Focus-Diving into a Military Swat with a Machine gun blazing, or blowing out the tires off an air plane miles off with a sniper rifle. * Controls - They meld perfectly with the way you'd move as a Matrix character. They only take the first level or so to get use to. And there are no camera controls other than switch to first-person and back. The camera is always right over your sholder, so your never blinded by an anoying object that gets between the camera and Niobe/Ghost. Overall Rating - "Must Buy"	1
The story is the same you all know... The story covered in The Matrix and Matrix Reloaded movies.. They tell that we live in a simulation, a world controled by a computer. And people tell that there's one man who can change the rules of the Matrix (that's how our world is called), such as gravity. Once they discover, they free this guy's mind, and he's called The One, he's Neo... They say while the Matrix exists, the human race will never be free.. And Neo is the one who shall destroy the Matrix.. But the path of the One is made by many.. If the others fail, the One will fail.. And, in this game, you are two of this "others": Ghost and Niobe. - Graphics: This aren't the best ever, but they're still good.. The characters look realistic, but some backgrounds are just lame, such as in the Sewers part, they just make me sick.. It's cool that when you kick things in the background such as books, they fall; when you shoo the walls, you see that the bullets were hitting there and this kind of stuff... Pretty good. - Sound: This is almost perfect, except that they are always the same and you get sick of it sometimes, when you play the game for a long time. The voice acting is great, because they are directly from the actors from Matrix Reloaded. The soundtrack is from the Matrix Reloaded too, and there are some pretty good songs in the credits. - Fun: If you are a Matrix fun, you'll feel great to be Ghost and Niobe, fight people that Neo fighted in the movie, fight Trinity as Ghost (you can't play as Neo, Trinity or Morpheus) and this kind of stuff. For the rest of the people, this game just won't be that fun... Even for us, fans, it gets boring in some parts... The movements are cool.. Walk through walls, incredible kicks and everything... And you see some things that happened behind Neo's path... One of the best things is the multiplayer mode, hidden in the Hacking mode... The hacking mode itself is great, and you can find lots of guides around there... In the multiplayer mode you can play as Morpheus, Trinity and some game bosses... In the first movie's (Dojo, which is the Kung-Fu arena in The Matrix; and the Subway Station, where Neo and Smith fight in The Matrix) and the game's scenaries (all the others). And that's not all you can do in the Hacking mode.. You can also open a new level, a new weapon and lots of pics! But it's not easy to get all of that! - Educative: There are some bad words in this game (which is no big deal). There is also a part in the game where a woman kisses another woman (no big deal either), and there is violence (kicks and this kind of thing). It's OK for everyone, in my opinion... Overall, worth a buy if you are a Matrix fan, if you're not, just worth a rent... But there is only one way to be inside the Matrix, one way to fight Agents and walk through walls.. Just playing this game.	1
I must say I really enjoyed this game.  It didn't seem to get boring the game ran smoothly and the storyline was awesome.  For die hard fans of the Matrix this game is a must it takes place on Naobi's ship during the Matrix Reloaded.  It gives you some movie sequences and info that is not present in the movie and I would almost say this game is a companion to the movie.  The only real problem I see in the game is that the missions can be redundant and for those with short attention spans certain missions can seem to last an eternity.	1
I was a little nervous about buying Blitzkrieg.  In general, I've disliked real-time strategy games like this and I was worried about buying a product supported from Germany.  But I couldn't be more pleased.  Blitzkrieg in an excellent game. This is basically a tactical level strategy game.  You are given a certain amount of assets and mission objectives and you attempt to carry them out.  Usually, this means your "core group" of 3-6 tanks and a battery of artillary.  As the war goes on, this core groups becomes more experienced and you can upgrade their hardware, sometimes getting cutting edge weapons as a reward for completing a mission.  You also have snipers, foot soldiers and support trucks.  And in historical missions, you can have a massive array of tanks, rocket launchers, artillary and troops.  And all these assets are rendered with splendid and incredible detail.  Facing a Tiger tanks with Shermans?  Better sneak around and attack from the back where his armor is weak.  You go face to face and he'll kill you without getting a scratch from your popgun cannons.  Attacking a trench?  Watch out for mines and grenades.  Even the artillary pieces have operators who can be killed without damaging the weapon -- which can then be taken over by your own troops. The thing that makes this game fun is the flexibility.  There's not one set way to win a mission.  This applies to the computer as well.  It frequently adapts to circumstances.  If you don't watch carefully, he'll sneak a platoon of soldiers behind your line to savage your artillary and trucks.  Your snipers can spy enemy tanks and call in an artillary strike.  But if he sniffs your presence, his tanks will roll out and attack.  You have to be careful even tooling down a road because he might set a a few soldiers and AT guns on a cliff to deliver a devastating blow to your armor.  Or you can set an ambush of your own and lure his armor out into it.  If you're getting artillary fire, you can order your artillary to lay a supressing barrage -- only to see him pick up, move to a new location and open fire. The game is not easy.  I've frequently had to restart because I stupidly charged in with armor and no troops and got slaughtered.  Or I used my air support to bomb a few tanks instead of holding back and fending off his bombers when they went after my artillary.  The Soviet campaign is especially difficult as the German weapons totally outclass you in the beginning of the war that it's almost impossible to win. There are a few problems.  The software is a little twitchy and somtimes likes to drop the frame rate for no reason.  And I would really have liked to seen a branching campaign where you could invade England as the Germans or attack the Russians as the Americans. But overall this is fantastic.  The realism is amazing and the gameplay is engrossing.	1
I was really hesitant to buy this game because I already own Sudden Strike and SS Forever - naturally I thought that this title would simpy be a rehash of the same SS material (remember SS2?). But I was patient (and diligent in looking at the new daily online reviews fom different gamers). Every wargamer I spoke to or read basically said the same thing - that Blitzkrieg was really an amazing game and whatever SS lacked (we are talking about 2-3 year old tech), this particular title had. So I went out and bought the game. Let me tell you something my fellow wargamers - this title is simply awesome. I was impressed on many fronts (no pun intended). And the game is what SS should always have been. Graphics - Simply amazing. The way that the landscape/buildings looks and the way the units have been rendered is what I lke the most. I'm really glad you can see all the unit insignia's because in SS you can barely see the camoflage on the tanks. Now all those fine details are there. Gameplay - I finally have the control I need on the units. This makes the breakdown of squads and platoons much easier than in the past - and this makes the gameplay all that much more enjoyable. Historical value - Besides the fact the most of the missions conform to actual campaign missions from WW2, the game boasts a historical overview inc. maps before every mission. Nival also included a great deal of movie footage as well as a unit/vehicle database which I think is just amazing and adds much atmosphere to the game. BTW, I heard that the developers (who are Russian - Spasiba guys) spent a great deal of time in the Moscow miltary museums researching the specs on different weapons and armour. Their hard work and research really made a difference with this title. I cannot wait to see what CDV has to offer with the game Panzers which is coming out early next year... Strategy - this is not like Starcraft where you can build 5 squads of marines and rush an enemy base. There is a great deal of thought involved in playing this genre of wargame, and the appeal is strong amongst the "tabletop" crowd. The one beef I do have with CDV games in general is that they do not have a contract with a Publishing House to print Strategy Guides, and for a company that prides itself on producing top-notch military-strategy games, this is a suggestion for the future. Overall - I would recommend this game to anyone who is any of the following: a) a SS/SS2 fan who wants more out of their SS/SS2 gaming experience. b) a WW2 military history buff. c) a military desktop wargamer. d) a RTS fanatic. I am really glad I went and picked up this title and I forsee many enjoyable sessions with this game	1
I have only been able to play the demo, but the second I played it I knew I was going to buy this game, and I did. This game is most-likely, the best WWII, and for that matter, maybe the best war games ever made. The graphics are superb; a cool add on is when the mouse goes over a tree, it tells you what kind of a tree it is! The only drawback is that this game is frustratingly hard. I will spend one to two hours playing one leval. This game can also get repetative. I have only completed about five missions, and so far, all of them have had almost the exact same objectives: Capture the Large Village, Capture the Small Village, Destroy the Local Armory, and Capture the Enemy Wharehouse. Although it is repetative and hard, this game is very enjoyable. It is also very realistic. The sound is very realistic, a gun actually sounds like a gun, and so does a bomb. The gameplay is very easy to learn, and it is rather easy to control large armies. Some details about the game that the demo listed: -Unlimited Random missions -Three historically accurate Campigns -Over 40 different vehicles and units -Modify or add new Campaigns, missions or units (this does not work for me; I submitted to a forum and the people there are really helpful, but this other guy told me that it was just to hard to understand-you have to be a total computer nerd to understand how to do it-don't buy this game if you can't wait to make your own missions! etc. BR>This game has got to be one of the funnest games I have ever played, and that's just the demo! This is how I rate this game: Graphics: 9.3 Gameplay: 9.8 Sound: 9.5 Realism: 10! This game is highly fun and highly recommended.	1
Official Synopsis: IN THE WAR TO SAVE ZION, WHAT PART WILL YOU PLAY? Unparralleeled fil collaboration results in a true Matrix experience. Exclusive film footage from the creators of the Matrix trilogy. Battle alongside the original motion picture cast from The Matrix Reloaded. My thoughts: Enter The Matrix is an excellent video game for many reasons. One of those reasons is that it weaves in and out of the movie, The Matrix Reloaded. Another reason is the awesome gameplay it brings you. You can run up walls, dodge bullets in bullet time, and have a wide armistice of martial arts at your fingertips. Basically, it's all the action of The Matrix Reloaded on your Gamecube. But if you play this, and you see an Agent, then RUN. They're unbeatable. I highly reccommend this game of the year nominee. It's available on all three next-gen consoles, and if you haven't played it yet, do it. After all, THE MATRIX HAS YOU.	1
Atari is back with a five star game! I have yet to see the first matrix, so I don't know if the game is based on the movie yet. This game reminds me of Max Payne for PS2 and XBox because most of the moves are the same and you can enter bullet time at will! This game ain't for anyone who loves shooters because your most likely to do more hand to hand combat than shooting. And yes, the world famous move, the lean back to dodge the bullet is in there, too. And the agents are back and even harder than ever! If I had to choose between renting it or buying it, I would buy it without even thinking about renting it!	1
I didn't think I would ever buy this game, but I did, because I got a good deal. I thought it would be the perfect compliment to The Matrix Reloaded, which really rocked. However, while the game is reminiscent to The Matrix in many ways, it falls flat on several counts. The graphics are good, but not exactly pushing the GameCube's power to the limit. They are better than the PS2 version. The weapons, the moves, the addition of the focus-mode, really gives the game a good feel. At least we don't have to deal with compressed videos, since the GCN version is two disks. A Progressive Scan option, along with Dolby Pro Logic II and a great musical score makes it good. I'm not saying it's a bad thing playing as Niobe or Ghost, but we were looking for the A-Team (Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity). The characters' movements are a little off, and at times it can get really frustrating. Overall, while this game is very good, it's just not the mind-blowing experience I was expecting. It is worth at least a rental, but you're all Matrix fans, so I say buy it.	1
Very fun game for those who are Matrix fanatics!  If you enjoyed the movie, you'll enjoy the game.  Here's your chance to do incredible moves, like running up walls, and to enjoy battling those nasty agents.  The action is sometimes hard to keep up with, but the game is very fun. Enjoy the Matrix!	1
Hi, my name is andrew and I got this game the day it came out (I am a big matrix fan) and when I opened it up there were two discs one disk that had the game on and one dist that had speatial features on it. well the game is the best game I have so far (and I think it will be my favorite forver) this game is so cool, the only problem is that you can't foight as neo or anybody from the first movie. you can play as niobe or ghost. if you press the slowmotion button and press other buttons you do super moves and far out jumps and stunts, you get tons of guns and You get to beat the crap out of gaurds and swat teams. I could not stop playing untill I got a head ache, for staring at the scrren so long, it has the original score sound track and wen you get to really cool parts the music turns into cool techno music. it also has the sound effects form the movie and the real voices form the real actors who play their parts. graphics 10/10 it looks so real and when you are in slow motion you can see the buletes with the shock waves behind them. sound 10/10 it has great music greadt sound effects, it really sounds like your in the movie theater controls 9/10 I would give it a ten butt when you drave it hard to control and it is takes alittle while to get a hang of it, other than that they are perfect. loading time 10/10 it is very quick so there is not alot of waiting. Fun 100/10 thats right if you like a great action game with kunfu and shooting, and slow motion than you will love it bulettes flying past you head doing a flip off the wall and kicking I guy straight across the room, and blowing up helicopters, and flying upside down shooting gaurds in stow motion with a machine gun. if you like action games or if you just like the matrix get this game. p.s. I know what some of ;you are thinking  "well I think I want to rent it frirst so I know what its like" well that is what I was thinking but I thought that it would be good I went and got it and it was the perfect game. if you think it is not going to be what you think than think again it is more that you could imagine. take my word for it just buy it. bye Andrew	1
I had a really hard time finding this game for my little brother and I. We used to play this all the time a couple years ago so when I found this I was exited to play it for old times. Great game good service, can't ask for much more.	1
Bought this as a gift and they have informed me that they love it. Was somewhat difficult for them at first but a great challenge.	1
In comparison to other squad-based shooters, (Rainbow 6, Brothers in Arms, SOCOM, & Ghost Recon), Freedom Fighters also rocks!  For a game that's 10 years old, the gameplay, missions, graphics, music, voice actors, locations, maps, camera system, & sound design are all "STILL" great, but what makes the game OUTSANDING and is the STAR of the show is the IA's performance throughout the game. I can have 12 people on my team at the same time, I can send THEM out on missions, placing them wherever I want them to be, and they all do thier jobs BRILLIANTLY without ANY problems (such as getting stuck in places, taking dumb paths around obstacles, standing in the middle of gun fire, not taking cover, and me having to "baby sit them" all the time, or come to their rescue).  Although Rainbow Six, Brothers in Arms, SOCOM, and Ghost Recon games allows me to have a group of squadmates to command, one slight problem I have with them is that they don't allow me complete freedom of using my imaginaton to come up with scenarios to complete missions the way that I want to. Freedom Fighters however, lets me to do this by allowing me to either strategically send members of my team in groups, or, (and this is most important) send them "individually" to ANY POSITION on the battle field to complete a mission the way I wanted to.  I really think that other squad-based shooter game developers should take a look at Freedom Fighters and consider this "freedom of troop placement" that Freedom Fighters allows the gamer to have, and put gameplay elements like this in thier future games.  The enemy AI are also not stupid in this game either.  They duck, cover, strategize, and do a great job in being a pain in the butt to the gamer.  It probably take a lot of work to make a squad-based action game, but the developers did a great job with Freedom Fighters. So far... this is THE BEST squad based shooter game i've ever played, and if a sequel is ever made, i'll be sure to play that one too. Good job IO Interactive team.  Well done.	1
This game is the worst game I have played since Land of the Dead: Road To Fiddlers Green. To start, how can this game get a decent grade for controls!? Its TERRIBLE and BROKEN!!!!!!! To aim down-sight you must press the LEFT STICK!!! WTF!!? And not only that, but you have to effin hold the thing!!!!!!! And since the control sensitivity is a default ULTRA LIGHT SPEED FAST, it is IMPOSSIBLE to aim. Jumping is left trigger... yeah, wtf!? Additionally, to switch weapons you must hold the RIGHT stick in and open an inventory screen in which you freeze your character in place and leave him open to be attacked and most likely killed.... on top of THAT your guns are atrocious in aiming... you will literally, I mean L-I-T-E-R-A-L-L-Y shoot circles around the soviet soldiers. ON THE SUBJECT of Soviet soldiers... these motha flippins take SOOOOO many shots that not even the marvel super hero Hulk could survive... gotta calm down.. back to the controls. Eventually you get to lead your rebellious New York soldiers, so "Y" tells them to go to one spot (if you hold down Y then the entire team goes to the spot while just tapping it sends ones soldier), pressing "B" tells them to defend one spot, and "X" tells them to regroup.. sounds easy right? well its NOT!!! I guarentee you will find yourself pressing X to reload, but wind up calling your men back... what IS the reload button you ask? HAHAHAH! There is none, you actually reload if you don't shoot for a handful of seconds. Very awkward if there is a break in an intense fire fight yanno? Its like... *RATATATATATATATA...reload automatically while enemy is standing there shooting you*  Lets talk about the AI and the bugs plauging this lackluster game. Theres a SERIOUS chopping issue within Freedom Fighters, where enemies can shoot through and run walls, appear out of thin air, or just never stop coming. Ontop of that you can stand in front of an enemy for about 5 minutes (yes I did time this) before they go "Holy **** thats an American soldier!" and shoot at you with 100% accuracy. Then comes your partner AI.... when it comes to shooting enemies they are okay, but they DO NOT LISTEN TO YOU!!!!! Numerous times have I told a soldier to stand in one spot only to see him run off and get slaughtered. OH YES I FORGOT TO MENTION: a LOT of the time, your soldiers will run towards fences that are suppose to basically be a barrier for the end of the level or a barrier to make you find another way around and actually run right through it.. I swear to Buddha.  I think the story and how they pieced together the missions were probably the only good part of this title. Basically, the Russians beat the United States in building the first atom bomb, nuked Japan and forced its way into Europe seizing control of the continent. From there they moved into Cuba and then one day attacked Manhatten, NY. Moving on, each mission affects another one. For instance in one mission labeled "The Bridge" you must use TNT to blow up a bridge, but you must clear the stage, then go back to the stage "The Hotel", pick up the TNT while heading back to "The Bridge" and then use the TNT on the bridge which will help the people from the "Firehouse" stage to sweep through. I thought that was kind of cool... but thats it.  A combination of horrendous controls, disgusting music, glitches, bugs, atrocious AI, and punishing difficulty make Freedom Fighters one of the worst original X-Box titles I have ever played. How in the name of Zeus did this game get a 9.3? I honestly do not see it.	-1
Freedom Fighters for the X Box is a cool game.  The overall concept is well done and interesting.  The game play is easy to pick up and figure out.  Graphics:  Not the best, but they are pretty good.  Control:  Easy.  Fun Factor:  Could play it over and over again.  Overall: The game is fun and easy to control; however, the game itself is way to easy.  It is perfect for new gamers.	1
Just about everything that freedom fighters does in does right. From the exciting story to the suberb gameplay and some of the best music to ever grace a game. First of all Freedom Fighters is underated and underappriciated. It didn't sell that well and that it a terrible shame because this is a game that should be experianced by all. I mean your hooked from the start and it just gets better and better. First of all the squad controls are excellant and easy to use no matter how many soldiers you have and eventually you'll have 12 soldiers under your command. Your squadmates are very intelligent, along with the enemy soldiers, exhibit some of the most impressive a.i. seen in game. The 3rd person shooting is handled well and the aiming system does take getting used to but eventually becomes simple enough. The graphics are very solid and the environments are all suberb and varied throughout the game. The character models are solid and the included ragdoll physics are again some of the best to grace a videogame. The weapon selection is a little lacking but not to big an issue. The music is absolutely suberb and always manages to keep you entralled in the game. From start to finish Freedom Fighters is a blast and easily one to keep playing. There is a multiplayer but it has only one mode that is fun but there simly needed to be more modes to play with. It sucks that it got low sales and that hurts the chances for a much needed sequel. But if ever a game deserved a sequel Freedom Fighters would be it. So if you have not played freedom fighters, do yourself a favor go pick it up, you won't regret, and hell it only costs like 10$ so what have you got to lose?	1
the AI in this game is amazing. the men/women you recruit not only follow your orders, they are also highly intuitive- for example, they won't only stay in the area you send them, they will find cover, the will duck during heavy enemy fire, and will search out and destroy all enemies within a perimeter.  F.F.'s is so much more tactical than i thought it would be. i love sending out three of my team to one area and another three soldiers to another- it's just so COOL!  it took me a very long time to purchase this game. i pretty much figured that i'd just stay happy with lo interactive's (is it lo or io???) hitman series and not push my luck with some of their side projects- well 'luck' had it that i recently saw this game for $15 and said, "why not?" suffice it to say that i'm really surprised, and will now ALWAYS purchase games that lo interactive puts out.  the reason i'm not giving my overall score a five is because i have yet to play the multiplayer and judging by other people's reviews, it's not that great. although- the single player ROCKS far more than i ever thought possible so...  ...i highly recommend this must-have title!!!!!!	1
I loved Hitman 2 with the multiple routes on each level and you can go in guns blazing or use stealth. About 2 years later when Hitman 2 came out Freedom fighters came out(simular to Conflict Desert Storm). When playing the game there's not alot of originality. You can't control your team mates like in Conflict Desert Storm. At the start of the game you are plumbing in New York and the Soviet Union come to take over New York. You armed with a Pistal run out of a building and shoot 3 Soviets when they get of a helecopter and thats been done before in a game. You then go running through the streets and there's a sense of great atmosphere with smoke and helicopters bombing the streets. You dash to a building to an injured soldier. This is new because when you sacrifice one of your medikits to a fellow citizen you get a thing called charizma. Charizma is where you get respect and trust from soldiers on your side. The more Charizma points the more recruits you get on your side. When you get enough points to get one person helping you and you get one circle. When your hours through the game you'll eventually get 12 circles(12 recruits). When you rescue your friend you'll go through a basic tortual. You get told how to jump, climb, go into first person view and shoot exsploding barells to catch onto enemies and to use medikits. Most of this has been done before but the game is great at its job. When you select a fighter you can by accident pick someone with a pistal and not with a machinegun and the guy will then be useless. Another thing is that you by accident can use friendly fire against your recrutes. Couldn't both sides be a totally different colour so you don't get mixed up. A good thing is that enemy AI and your recruits are very intelligent. If you order your recruit to go charge at the enemy they will run to a great cover point and use it so they won't get shot(AI is better than Conflict Desert Storm)and they put their back against the wall Metal Gear Solid style and then shoot at the enemies. A big problem is where you have 3 levels to choose from and one of the levals is important to go on first. On a firestation level there is a flying helicopter that guns you down and it's not a good idea to go on that level first. The game should of made it clear that you should go on an other level to find some C4 and plant it next to the parked helipad to blow it so it doesn't rip you to pieces on the Fire Station level. On your second go of the game you will obviously forgive the game. There's nothing worse than you running with your group confidently with your team and then a Soviet using a gun turret puts your life away for good buy shooting you down. There could of at least be more save points plotted around the big maps because it's annoying to restart each level again . When your team mate gets badly injured it can be hard to find where he is so that you can heal him to work for you again. A useful thing is that when you push back it shows the map with red dots to show where your mate is who's been put out of action. The game can be great fun at times because the controls are as simple as it can get. You push R Trigger to fire, Left Trigger to jump or climb, Black button to crouch(this can be frustrating because when your trying to stand up by pushing the button again you die because it takes you a while to reach for the button). White Button Melee(use butt of riffle to kill enemy), (A) is to recruit soldier or yourself to interact, (B)tell recruits to guard area, (Y)to tell soldiers to attack enemies in front, (X)command soldiers to follow yourself, Left analogue stick to move your own character and you can also click in the right analogue stick to change weapons or medikits. You push back to get a map of the level showing you where the manholes are for the sewers and that's where you can save. The game is fun with you ambushing a group of soviets with your helpers close behind. If you have 6 recruits you can order 1 recruit to use a gun turret and another to guard the guy, you can use 2 other men to charge at the Soviets and the remaining 2 guarding yourself and thats whats best about the game(team work). This game is very Cinematic with better music than Medal of Honour Rising Sun. You can shoot cars that exsplode and then it kills enemys. You also have Frag Grenades and Molotovs at your desposol and the bad thing is it can be hard to kill your enemy with a frag grenade on your first go because they just get back up after flying across the room. This game is great to buy for a teamed based shooter but my advice is to rent it to see if its annoying for you, but it's lacking in originality. Don't bother buying the 2 Conflict Desert Storms because there both too simular. When you buy one of the Conflict Desert Storm this is worthy to your collection.	1
I'll start off by saying that this is a very enjoyable game.  From start to finish the story pulls you in and the gameplay is just great.  The voice acting is some of the best I've heard in a long time.  I will also agree with the reviewer that says you will actually care about the characters and what happens to them.  The only poblem with this premise is that you do not connect with your recruits, just the main characters.  The gameplay is good, the characters reminded me a lot of the pedestrians from State of Emergency.  Along with the gameplay is the problem of commanding your recruits.  Pretty much all that there is is hold position and follow.  With games like Conflict: Desert Storm, you would think that developers would make it more in depth and be able to better control your fellow 'uprisers.'  A really cool thing is how the lead character changes as the game progresses and according to the weather.  In the beginning he is a clean cut plumber, at the end he's got long scraggly (is that a word?) hair and his clothes actually make you think he lives underground scavenging clothes.  Sorry, I guess I'm getting a little too indepth.  All in all it's a fun and enjoyable experience.  I beat it within a week.	1
Awsome game!  you get a chance to command your troops into battle, and the game has lots of action in it too!  The multiplayer is really REALLY cool, you get to command either Soviet, or American.  Capturing the flag is fun.  But thats the only thing you do, or.  At least the only mode you can play.  Awsome game though.  I strongly suggest buying it for Xbox so you can play four player.	1
I was a little hesitant to pick up this title.  The name had changed several times and they pushed the game back all the way up to the release.  For instance it was supposed to be released in the end of Sept but it was pushed back till Oct for some reason.  I heard some mixed reviews about the game so I almost didn't buy it.  But I'm glad I changed my mind.  I have had a blast playing this game.  Honestly my only major complaint is that I want more.  It just seems that if they added just a touch more than this game would be one of the top games to get for the xbox.  The multiplayer aspect is fun but if they really need to add at least three more maps.  Also some variations on the objectives instead of only playing their version of capture the flag.  This game is screaming for xbox live support.  The maps could've been downloadable content.  But it seems that microsoft and EA can never play nice when it comes to xbox live.  Other than my couple of complaints this game is a lot of fun.  I like switching between areas to complete various objectives such as blowing up helicopters and destroying bridges.  Which makes other missions easier.  I do have another complaint in the mini objectives though.  There should be a variety to the mini objectives instead of the same three over and over.  Instead they just increase the number of objectives.  So in one mission you may have to blow up a bridge.  Then in the second mission you have to blow up two bridges or three bridges.  And there always seems to be a helipad to blow up too.  A larger variety in weapons would be nice as well.  Sure there are rocket launchers but if you have one then you don't have a machine gun.  And if you find a sub machine gun then good luck finding enough ammo.  So you end up just using the assault rifle 95% of the time.  All of this would have really helped this game but its still a ton of fun.  It will definitely keep you busy until the big releases of the year start coming out in late oct through the holiday season.	1
This game is a enhanced version of Cossacks, with extreamly good RTS features and with the ablity to have 16,000 units it gets tence. If you liked Cossack or Age of Empires this is a great buy.	1
I didn't know what to expect, so the first thing that surprised me were the absolutely lush graphics. RTS games have always been a bit on the staid side when it comes to terrain graphics - plenty of detail but something always seems to be missing. Not so with AC, the ground detail is superb, rivers flow beautifully and trees and bushes are particularly lifelike. Although everything is 2D sprites, the units are fantastic and there is a real sense of a 3D element.  The game appears to try and maintain an accurate historical timepath, running from Columbus' landing, right through to the American Revolution. When playing in campaign mode, you get a little history lesson at the start of each new scenario that sets the scene for your objectives perfectly.  The most noticeable difference between American Conquest and any other RTS is seen in the use and creation of troops. Any one unit is exactly that - one unit, and each units strengths are accurately mapped to - A conquistador with a pike and armour is more than a match for just about any single Mayan / Aztec opponent, but slower and prone to ranged fire. This tends to lead to battles on an epic scale with upwards of 500 units engaged on the screen at once (with very little sign of slowdown too I must add).  Again, in a break from the traditional RTS mould, troops are not created out of thin air - if you want 100 musketeers, you will need 100 peasants to create them. Peasants are created from dwellings (the more dwellings, the higher your population limit), while the troops are created from a fortress. You therefore need to churn out an endless supply of peasants (ctrl click on any build icon gives infinite production), having set the rally point on your fortress, and, as peasants go in, your musketeers come out.  Micromanagement is kept to a fairly simple scale; you need grain to feed your population, and wood, stone, iron, gold and coal to buy / manufacture your troops and manage any upgrades. Mines have worker limits that increase with each upgrade and farming is pleasantly efficient. Resources appear to be a bit on the scarce side, so upgrading the mines and ensuring they are always maxed out with workers is a must. It is also worth setting a few troops to guard each mine as they are very easily captured.  So, having got all your mines producing and plenty of peasants gathering wood and corn, the time is right to start organizing your massive forces. This can be achieved by forming them into armies, controlled by an officer with a standard bearer and drummer also required for morale purposes. Unfortunately for you, you'll find that the officers are not much into leading from the rear, and have a bad habit of charging in and getting killed quickly, leaving you with an effective, but not so easily controlled force. Also bear in mind that you will need a lot of troops - buildings can be (and often are) heavily defended and you will lose an awful lot of troops capturing buildings (mind you, when you get cannons, you can just blow them up from a great distance).  Adding some good sound really enhances the battles and AC does it perfectly - the music is not too loud and the battle sounds and effects are realistic.  As said before, buildings can be defended - all you need do is stick a few troops inside and any building becomes a virtual blockhouse. However, they are by no means impregnable as a great deal of though has gone into building defence and there are zones of fire limited by the buildings themselves - once you can get troops inside these zones they cannot be hit by ranged fire and can then storm the building - but expect heavy losses.  The same kind of detail has been applied to ranged fire - ordering a musketeer to shoot an enemy at extreme range fails more often due to the inherent inaccuracy at large ranges. This is also especially noticeable with cannons - until you manage to afford all the upgrades from your town centre.  Unfortunately, despite all the detail that has been put in place, American Conquest suffers a bit from a slightly dodgy AI. Big battles are really the name of the game here but the AI just sends continuous streams of enemy troops to harass your positions which are easily defended against, while you can build up a huge force and then just march in and wipe everything out. Also, all your units often appear to have been taking performance enhancing drugs, as the speed that they can move around at is somewhat inappropriate. Forming your troops into an army is also not without problems - setting them to `stand ground' (the army takes up a very nice box formation) means they do just that - if attacked they might fire back but generally they just stand there and take a beating. Leaving them in standard formation has the opposite effect, they will follow the enemy till either it or your army is obliterated.	1
This is a very good solid strategy game, and I am impressed. This game reminds me of Stronghold Crusader. These two games are the best strategy games on the market today, trust me. You don't have to play these games online to enjoy them. The realism in the game is amazing,along with the graphics, and you don't need an Area 51 computer for the game to run smooth, that in itself is a great triumph, for the makers of this game, and I salute you. The zoom feature is just right which is the L Key, Plus you can hit the enter key,,,,type...view all to reveal the map, You can type in a few more phrases,if you want to. This will probably be the only true american revolutionary game you will ever get your hands on, Go buy this game,I know a good game when I play it. One of the reviewer, said the soldiers can only fight, I beg the differ, they can shoot some of the wildlife, for food,then take it to the storehouse. I would like to clarify one of the reviewer,statement,saying the soldiers move too fast,, well let me say, there is a slider button on the option menu,so you can slow the movements of the troops, and every thing else.	1
I must admit that I've only played this on my Playstation 2, but I can't imagine the two games being too different and since I'm more in love with my X-Box, I feel as though I should review the X-Box version. First of all, let me start off by saying that if you've ever played the PC version, it shouldn't take long at all to get used to the controls for the console game. After playing it for a day or two, you'll be back in the game creating characters, building storylines and helping your Sims lead their every day lives. Not much has changed in the world of The Sims from the PC to console transition, but a few things are improved. What's Good: If you're like me, playing any game with a mouse, let alone The Sims, is a chore within itself. Consider the chore gone. No longer is clicking specifically and scrolling a big issue. Now you have buttons and a joystick to help you do all of this and it makes the game much more simple. Also, I remember on my PC loading the game was a problem that took much longer than I liked. Now loading is as simple as waiting a couple seconds. There are many more options on the console version as to what your Sim will wear or what your Sim will look like. From dark and skinny to pale and overweight, however you create your Sim is entirely up to you. And another thing, I'm not sure if this was on the PC version or not, but here you can have a same sex relationship if you choose. I don't know if it works for two men, but it does for two women. What's Bad: There are a few minor problems with this game and that's why I've given it only 4 stars. My main problem is that while playing the game it's frozen maybe 3 or 4 times which makes you have to reset the machine. Now sometimes this isn't a major burden, but if you've been playing for hours and your Sims have progressed in their storylines, when you have to restart the game you lose your progress which can make some gamers like yours truly VERY angry. My suggestion is save your progress about once ever half hour or an hour. That way if you lose your spot, it's not such a huge deal. However, maybe the X-Box version doesn't freeze. Also, there's no way to FAST forward the game. You can fast forward it, but it's not FAST. It's actually very slow and the only time it does go fast is when they're sleeping and sometimes your Sims can miss work because of it. Another problem is that you can't download Sims (such as Eminem or Michael Myers or Gwen Stefani) onto the console game. And I think I remember there being a pause button on the PC version. Now if you have to get up and use the bathroom, you have to go to the main menu where you buy or build stuff instead of pausing it. This is a hassle because they play very irritating music while on that menu. What's The Same: It's still a ton of fun and very addictive. People used to the PC version should have no trouble getting into this. People playing The Sims for the first time, just make sure you have your instruction booklets handy and remember that this game takes time and patience and that you'll be glad you waited it all out. Your Sims are still very needy and bossy people who have zero patience, but treat 'em well anyway! And if you get evil ideas to kill off your Sims, know that you're not alone my friends. Not alone at all.	1
I love the game, but I received a copy that had a ring around it. Not sure if it plays as I don't have the Xbox anymore, but oh well. Paid less than $5.	1
I love the fact that I can re-live and start over with how my husband I met. I love this game  because we get to have a second wedding virtually :)	1
This game wil provide you hours of fun! In my opinion its better then the second one. Its really chill.	1
While I like the computer version, which is tailor-made for nerds like me, better overall, the xBox version is not without its charms. The eye candy is incredible. The houses are so realistic! And the character creation is so much fun! (though, oddly, I can't get my characters to look quite as lifelike as I can on the computer) And it is such a kick to get to see my Sims on the big screen. Plus, you can have as many neighborhoods as you want.  Some things the computer version has that the Xbox version doesn't have: Two-story houses, more career tracks, 8 people to a family instead of 4, 10 families to a neighborhood instead of 6, more objects and decor (though the xBox also has some the computer version doesn't), the ability to go in super-fast mode even when people are at home and awake, etc.  The computer version can hold my attention for 12+ hours at a time; with the xBox I get bored after 2 or 3 (maybe it's because I'm on a nice comfy sofa instead of a hard-backed computer chair, so I fall asleep! *wink*). However, those 2 or 3 hours are a lot of fun. I recommend this game.	1
Warning: highly addictive... I bought this game awhile ago...and it's highly addictive..I've had oodles of fun playing this game. While it's not perfect (what game is?) I liked it. The game looks quite simple, but after a few hours of gameplay..you begin to figure out that this is not the case. One has to juggle their personal needs with building up their stats (logic, fitness, etc.), having personal relationships, their jobs and their health.   I having said there are a few issues with the game. This world has you working 7 days a work, 8 hours a day. You do the math. It would be very nice if the game allowed you 2 days off in a row without the risk of losing your job. You are allowed to miss 1 day, but if you miss more than one consecutive day, you get fired and have to start your career all over again. Needess to say, this can be rather difficult.. All in all, this is a fun game...but it's not for everyone...	1
I love this game on the PC and I love it on the Xbox.  The load time is much faster on the Xbox and the graphics are just great. It was just as addicting on the console as I played it for hours when I first got it. My only gripe with this Xbox version is the two player mode.  This great feature can only be unlocked after completing several "scenarios" within the game.  For those of us that are all too familiar with this game, unlocking that feature is tiresome and boring! Other than that, it is a great game to own	1
If you liked the sims on the computer then you will like this game even better.  It has a really fun 2-player set of mini-games, and a new game mode with goals and stuff.  And of course there is the normal gameplay that you find on the computer.  It is an awesome game that never ends so you can just play and play.  You can also unlock objects like showers and couches in Get a Life mode.  So this game is worth every penny you spend on it.	1
What makes this game so much fun? For whatever reason, I can't put a finger on it. But this much is true: if the game were more complex, if it had less humor, if it changed one thing, it would not be so successful as a video game! Certainly, this game is addictive. I had never played the PC version, but some buddies of mine have been crazy for it. I bought "the Sims" for XBOX the day it was released. It lived up to my expectations. Tons of fun, with lots of humor, very open-ended, and addictive! Let me write this homage to the folks at Maxis/EA: thanks for a revolutionary game! There's nothing else available like "the Sims." And I'm glad they made the commitment to bringing it to the XBOX console with the quality seen in the PC version. I especially enjoy the "Get a Life" game mode. The player creates a Sim and must meet goals to advance to newer and larger houses.  Sort of like a game within a game. Not only is the goal-oriented play addictive and interesting, it also acts as a very effective tutorial for the more open-ended "Play the Sims" game mode. I really applaud Maxis/EA for including the "Get a Life" mode, which I do not think is available in the earlier PC version. One gripe I have (which is an insignificant gripe) is that I was not able to import my Sim from "Get a Life" into my "Play the Sims" neighborhood. I would have really liked that option. Since I needed to create a brand new character for my "Play the Sims" neighborhood, I created a young, single black man living in a modest home and starting a career in the military. One of the coolest things about the Sims is that you can create a character just like you (I am a 25-year old married white male). But sometimes even better is the ability to role play the life of someone very different from you!	1
When my little sister first got this game, I thought it would be like any other Sims game I played. Play it then get bored in 10 minutes. You see, I never really fell in love with the PC Sims game. Maybe it was because of the snail-slow loading times, maybe something else. But I am highly suprised with this game. PROS: 1. The Sims are on XBOX! 2. Some good 2-player mini games 3. The Get a Life mode is a great addition. 4. And the same old Sims goodness (court wife, court neigbors wife, court neighbors daughter, court girlfriend, etc.) 5. and some more extra goodies in between (did I hear Monkey Butler?) 6, you got to earn the original sims mode and other goodies (in the original menu, it only has "Get A Life" mode) CONS: 1. There is something missing in the graphics, but I cant tell what 2. Controls are hard to understand and frustrating 3. you've played the original sims version before 4. Only has the first 3 sims version on it (so there is no vacation mode, no pets, and no nightlife) 5. the Love Bed is locked when you start the game. THE LOVE BED!!! 6. I HATE DUDLEY LANDGRABB!!! He is so lazy! He doesnt even answer the phone! (calls it "hell's bells") FINAL VERDICT: Avid Sims fans can sprint to the store to get this one. Casual fans can walk.	1
For the most part, I enjoy playing this game.  Just as it was during my OS/2 days, it's a good turn-based strategy game (with much improved graphics).  There are a few problems with it which, hopefully, they'll fix in future updates.  First, it seems that all resource allocation is done at a global level.  So, if you have a really advanced planet that's built all the social projects, there's no way to turn off the social spending on that planet alone.  It has to be done at a global menu for ALL planets.  I've played games where all my planets except one had built everything they could (at that point).  But, to keep my lesser planet moving forward, I had to keep dumping tons of cash down the drain on those other planets.  The unused spending doesn't get put back into the treasury.  It just disappears.  Secondly, it would be nice if you could set a destination for ships at the planet level.  IOW, tell the planet that every ship it builds should automatically head for some location on the map.  This would be especially useful when building Starbases.  They take dozens of ships and every one of them has to be manually targeted to the location.  There are a few other quibbles, but those two are my biggest complaints.  Overall, still a pretty good game. BTW.  Make sure you download the updates to this game as soon as you get it installed.  Apparently, they contain quite a few fixes which enhance game play.	1
I've been participating in the beta program since August of last year, and endorse the previous reviewer's comments.  I would also like to point out that there are some things (most especially the concept of starbases, which is now a key part of the game but was never part of the original OS/2 version) that were added through the input of beta testers which have dramatically enhanced the game.  GalCiv's Windows version has had one of the most thorough and intense beta periods of any PC game that I know of - indeed, the "delay" in release until March 26th has allowed Stardock and its gamma testers to tweak the playability even more - and I have no hesitation whatever in recommending it to the general gaming public. As for multiplayer? It's overrated, IMHO.  The AI is so outstanding in this game that I guarantee you you won't miss multiplayer capability once you've gotten battered a few times at the hands of the Drengin or the Yor on "genius" level.	1
After buying this game, I went back and read the negative reviews more closely, and it seems to me that they are generally correct. I have loved 4x games since I played the first Civ, but this game leaves a lot to be desired. I get the impression that the designers were really focused on having a good AI (which is nice), but along the way they left out a lot of other things (which was not so nice). Galactic Civilizations seems much more like an experimental prototype for a later, more sophisticated release, rather than a fully developed game in its own right. One thing that is completely missing is the ability to improve your territory. This is normally a big part of 4x games, and I never really realized how important it is to game play until now. During the course of the game you colonize planets, and each planet has a simple "quality score" that generally varies from 1 to 20. All planets of the same quality rating are exactly alike in game terms; you don't have some planets that produce a lot of trade resources, other planets that produce a lot of minerals, and so on. They are all just "generic planets of quality X." I think this might have been acceptable (maybe) had this game come out in 1990... but for a game released in 2003, this is just not sufficient in my opinion. The interface is also not that great... sometimes it would be nice to able to use the keypad for maneuvering your ships, rather than the mouse. However, they didn't include keyboard shortcuts for commands, so you have to constantly switch back and forth from the mouse to the keyboard, or just give up and use the mouse constantly. Also, the game lacks many customization options: for example, you always play against the same 5 alien races, no matter how large or how small the galaxy is, and you can't turn off "features" like random effects that can have a huge effect on the game. There is no multiplayer option, which was puzzling a couple of years ago when Civ 3 came out without multiplayer but is almost unbelievable now. Finally, despite all the talk about the "non-cheating AI" the fact is that the computer players start out knowing the location of all the good star systems, while you have spend quite a few turns stumbling around trying to find good spots to colonize. Altogether I rate this as something of a disapointment: a good AI in search of a game.	-1
I've been a fan of "4X" space games since I first played "Starflight" on sega genesis. Galactic Civilizations is a streamlined prettier version of that early spacer. Expand your civilization, explore strange new worlds (to a limited degree) and seek out new life and possibly blow it to smithereens. The graphics are nothing special, a strictly 2-D interface with a minimum of frills. The advantage being you don't need a burner to make this game run. The real fun is the AI, which can be set at several different levels (from cakewalk to masochistic). The AI is really smart! As far as I can tell it doesn't cheat until you get to the really difficult levels and therefore you don't feel like the computer gets cheap shots or breaks at the lower levels of the game. There are five major alien civs to play against. You can form alliances, trade goods, and discover new technologies to make your civilization the pride of the galaxy. One of my favorite facets of the game is deciding whether to be good or evil. During the course of any given game you will presented with moral choices, as the game progresses the choices affect your standing in the galaxy. If you become evil, races will fear you, some will try to destroy you. If you are good, you can draw races to you and eventually take over their societies culturally. Lots of other stuff, too many little gems hidden in the gameplay to list. I'll just say buy it, you'll like it.	1
Galactic Civ has a lot of depth--the technology tree is huge. The graphics are decent.  The UI is livable if a bit quirky in places.  The game has a unique feel to it, because its approach to economics, ship building, etc., are different from other turn-based strategy games that I've played (MOO, Civ2).  Some people have complained about this, especially the different approach to ship building (which uses pre-defined ship classes that can't be customized), but there's nothing wrong with it.  You just have to be prepared for a new way of doing things. One problem with the game is that it is very poorly documented. You often have to build improvements and ships in order to determine what they really give you.  As an example, the first time I built a manufacturing center I was surprised to see my expenses go up by twice the monthly maintenance fee for the center.  It took a lot of hunting around on the web and playing with the game before I figured out what was going on. (Increasing your manufacturing output always costs you money and never makes you any money in GalCiv.  This isn't entirely intuitive, but once you know this, you can factor it into your tactics.  Don't expect the manual to give you this type of information.  It doesn't even define the term "manufacturing" anywhere....) Also, many aspects of the game work on a delayed reaction time. One example: I had a starbase providing a 65% bonus to the social and military production of planets in that sector. When I destroyed the starbase, it took about 3 game turns for the affected planets to show the change. This delayed reaction can be confusing and misleading, especially when you are trying to figure out what a particular improvement gets you. This game has other issues, including crashes to desktop and uneven difficulty levels. However, I am gradually getting to like the game better as I play it more.  Although the GalCiv developers obviously don't believe in documentation, they are doing a good job of continuing to support and enhance the game.  Overall, I like this game better than I did MOO2.	1
Ok, I admit to a certain fascination with strategic space combat games.  Two of my favorites continue to be Master of Orion, and its sequel.  Master of Orion III (recently released) however was a real disaster.. formula over substance, a bizarre mix of uncontrolled AI and tedious micromanagement, and no replay value.  Galactic Civilizations is, somehow, an exact opposite of Master Orion III despite stemming from the same basic concept.  Here's a quick run-down of the best parts of this game (although there are many more).  I will likely lapse into a comparison with Master of Orion III as a good example of every point this game made the right decision, but Galactic Civilizations is equally accessible to even the most casual strategic gamer. 1)  Ease of play.  I cannot stress this enough.  I took the game out of the box for the first time, installed it, started it up, and away I went.  Some of the nuances may require the manual, but everything is logically laid out and you can navigate throughout any sub menus with a simple point and click.  This is the exact opposite of Master of Orion III, which delights in instantly generating a baffling maze of overlapping and arcane sub-windows. 2)  Dynamic galaxies.  Not only are the galaxies as generated filled with all the necessary different planets and weird space phenomena, many of those phenomena will keep appearing throughout the game.  Your survey ships (used to explore weird asteroids, wormholes, and other space debris for potentially beneficial discoveries) are in constant motion.  Even sectors in the center of your galaxy can suddenly sprout temporal anomalies, derelict spacecraft, and other goodies. 3)  Morality counter.  Throughout the course of the game you are greeted with various Emperor-level decisions you have to make.  Each typically has three 'answers'..one "good," one "neutral," and one "evil".  For example, your scientists may have suddenly realized a way to re-animate the dead, giving you potential access to billions of zombies.  You can decide to 1) purge all knowledge, which is 'good' but costs you 500 credits, 2) store the knowledge and never use it (neutral), or 3)  Let the brain-eatings commence (evil, but your soldiers get 30% stronger). 4)  Turn-based.  Take your time, no need to worry that the 10 minutes you spent pondering which incredibly cool research option to choose (see #5) puts you behind the eight ball. 5)  Wild technology trees.  Not only are the technology research trees vast, they react to your in-game decisions and morality counter.  Evil empires get the option to research evil things, and so on for good ones.  Unlike many strategy games where any variation in the tech trees comes from randomness, much of this one comes from you.  Show a predisposition to loving evil mind control powers?  Time to dig up some more.  Can't get enough of pretty terraforming techs that spruce up (ahem) your planets?  Dig in. 6)  Smart, well-played enemies.  Your computer opponents (both Major races, your primary challengers, and minor races, France-like civilizations of one or two stars that often appear later in the game) behave intelligently, and don't cheat.  They won't go to war with you the turn after signing an alliance, nor randomly try to invade your most powerful planet with a single scout ship every single turn for 20 years.  You can even vary the difficulty setting of _individual_ civilizations, not the game itself.  So you can play against two races at "moron" intelligence, one at "normal" intelligence, and another at "genius" level all at the same time.  Heck, even their racial descriptions change depending on how smart they are.  Nor do they cheat at higher difficulties by getting free techs, money etc..they really are just a lot smarter in what they do. 7)  Engrossing political systems.  I never thought I would ever say that about a strategy game.  In the Civilization games, for example, you can choose between various governments as you learn them, typically upgrading each time, or using one type for war.  While in Galactic Civilizations you can also research new government types, you also have to choose a political party to be affiliated with.  Each party (military, pacifist, technologist etc) gives you various racial bonuses in addition to those you apportion when you start the game.  Moreover, every few years there is a short internal election (unlike those tedious voting conferences in MOOII and III) where, if you lose control of your senate, you lose some bonuses until the next election.  There's also a galactic council to play around with. 8)  Pre-built ships, and free-range space stations.  At first, I thought not being able to design my own ships would suck.  It doesn't.  In fact, it's oddly liberating..as you learn new techs, you get better ships by default, speeding up the whole process (also see the morality effects on technology trees above).  Also, you can use special ships to build space stations anywhere.  Those stations, as you upgrade them, give bonuses in the sector they're in for everything from trade to diplomacy to battles.  Layer them for even more fun. Anyway, check this game out.  You won't be disappointed.	1
With the millennium trailing in our wake, and videogaming now into its fourth decade, the idea of boutique game designers inventing or revolutionizing entire game genres out of their basements seems as quaint and anachronistic as a five-inch floppy drive or a dot-matrix printer.  Happily, StarDock has proven that there's still some life in the old David and Goliath story after all. GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS is distinguished by its tenacious, singleminded commitment to the hard-to-define but always- recognizable ideal of pure gameplay; everything in the package, from its streamlined user interface to the attractive-but- Spartan graphics, serves the cause of getting out of the player's way and allowing him to simply *play the game*. The game's setup is nothing new: you're the leader of united humanity as the species takes its first steps into the stars.  Five other major races share the galaxy with you, and you'll compete with them - economically, scientifically, politically, and militarily - with galactic mastery as your ultimate aim.  What's revolutionary about GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS is the artificial intelligence system used to govern the computer players; not only is it shrewder than almost any strategy AI I've yet seen (and without cheating or receiving free ships or techs!), it also behaves differently for each race - the militaristic Drengin will act differently from the morally ambiguous Arceans, even if both are pursuing a similar overall strategy. Speaking of overall strategies, that's another one of GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS' great innovations.  There are four overall options: conquer every planet in the galaxy, establish alliances with all the powerful races, market your culture so effectively that every species in the galaxy is wearing your fashions and eating your food, or advance your science to the point that you can transcend reality.  And these strategies can be combined in unusual and effective ways.  Not only is it possible to win without firing a shot - oftentimes, it's more fun!  My favorite game of GalCiv so far found me playing the role of galactic powerbroker - I had numerous lucrative trade links with every civilization (making them unable to attack me without crippling their economies) and I kept my chief rival, the genocidal Drengin, occupied by arming their numerous small enemies with battlecruisers and fusion bombs while my embassies and museums subverted the Drengin's culture from within. As with all the great games, picking up the basics of GalCiv is simplicity itself but mastery is considerably harder to come by.  Luckily, unlike so many modern games with considerably bigger budgets, it never feels like you're fighting the game's interface - everything is streamlined and readily-accessible.  The game runs smoothly and bug-free on almost any machine, even without the numerous upgrades available on the website, and it consumes only a tiny 150 MB of your hard drive - almost unbelievable in this day and age.  The tradeoff is that the graphics and sound are relatively simple, though not unattractive. All told, GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS is a more than worthy investment, one that will reward players in spades, especially given the developers' praiseworthy commitment to regularly  providing free new upgrades and content for the next year.  While its much bigger and more-hyped competitor, MASTER OF ORION 3, has become an infamous debacle, GalCiv has garnered more acclaim and sales than anyone had predicted - proving that the era of plucky developers succeeding purely on talent and luck is not so far behind us as we thought.	1
It's Civilization in space, and just as much fun.  Also addictive.  Gamer's with families beware! GalCiv does not break new gound in any aspect.  It simply uses a lot of tried and true ideas put together in a game that works right out of the box.  It's really simple to play, but also deeper than it looks.  It's not at all easy to edit (well, not for me, anyway)but for those who have the skill, some things can be edited.  That's one area where Civ3 has it beat.  Otherwise, graphics are good, sound is adequate, the AI is smart. The game seems to play out in three phases:  the first phase is a race to get all the planets you can.  Next grab and develop all the resources you can.  Last, get serious about how you're going to win.  There are four ways to win (no combo's) and the easiest seems to be cultural influence.  Of course straight-out conquest is one of the options, but unless you're playing at the easiest level, you'll find the AI will give you a serious run for the money. There are some bugs, but the developers are fixing them.  An expansion pack is promised.  The company seems to really listen to the customers and fans and the fixes and additions reflect that. One reviewer here mentioned the lack of a tech tree, and that really is a problem.  Another problem is the manual, which in order to be kind, I'll describe as thin.  An on-line, printable manual is available.  Haven't had time to evaluate it yet but it seems to be an improvement.  Within the game there are not a lot of options for building and research: you can only research one thing at a time and each planet can build only one ship and one "social" item at a time.  Interaction with AI computer players is also limited, much more so than in Civ3, for example. My main gripe (again) is the lack of an editor.  There seems to be no effort to remedy that and it may not even be possible until GalCiv2 comes out. In summary, a great game that is well thought out, fun, and easy to play.  Buy it.	1
This has everything I was looking for in MOO3 (which failed terribly) and more. -That 'one more turn' addictivness is there. -You feel like you are controling the game, it's not controling you. -It's a game with good depth and strategy to it, but not over kill to the point of feeling drudgery. -The AI is good and I have yet to see it make rediculous choices.  (For instance: when a rival civ declares war on you, they will feel they are ready for war and have a fleet ready to come after you imediatly.) -The Sciences work nicely with game play on a couple diffrent levels.  You get that sence of "I need that science so that I can ..." and so on and so forth.  The need to pick a scientific path and specalize or risk falling behind other civs is also a natural by product of the science system. There is more I could say.  I will list my one 'con'. -There are no 'warp lanes' between star systems.  The whole map is open on a grid system.  Any star can be reached from any other as long as your ships have the range.  In past games I have enjoyed the strategy involved in setting up defenses at stratigic star systems.  In this game there really aren't any single "stratgic systems" since anyone can get to any star. This has not effected my enjoyment of the game however. Buy this game.  It's well put together.  It's fun to play.  It is supported well by the company.  You will love it.	1
Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based game in which your aim is to dominate a galaxy of planets. You can only play a human, facing against other races of characters of various alignments and with varying cultural missions. Developed by StarDock, Galactic Civilizations is is a planetary take-off on the Civilization genre. The way in which you win is up to you. You can defeat the other planets with your military, or culturally enrich them all, or even unite them together in a worldwide peace. The AI is where this game shines - the computer notices if you are massing your troops in a given area or taking other steps to cause it harm. Your interface also adjusts depending on how you tend to act. If you start slaughtering helpless natives, your interface starts to take on a more dark tone. The game is relatively complex. You have to keep track of your armed forces on the various planets, you have to keep up diplomatic negotiations with your friends and enemies, plus track the economic status of your worlds. Definitely a game that you get sucked into and realize suddenly that it's 3am and it's time to get to sleep ... Graphics are good, and do the job of letting you see where your forces are and how your plans are progressing. This isn't a game of cutting-edge graphics, it's a game of pitting your intelligence against the AI of your many opponents. Balance your taxes with your spending, and move out to influence the rest of the planets. Highly recommended for turn-based gamers who enjoy a game with complexity.	1
Galactic Civilizations absolutely delivers...and more. FUN! I have played the Civ games, Alpha Centauri, the MOO games, and other strategy games dating back to such early dinosaurs as Sword of Aragon. GC delivers a very thorough strategy experience. Mention has been made that GC involves the player in the "feel" of the game. It does so, and very well. The game has made me feel very much a part of an epic story with the ebb and flow of politics, blunders, victories and defeats inherent in any storyline. Here is a comparison to MOO3, which I recently purchased and played for many hours: *MOO3 - flat story and feel. No feel of involvement or depth. The races all hate you. **GC - Good alien AI, you get a feel sometimes that a real person is playing their side. Some like you, some don't, some even regret being your enemies. *MOO3 - CARPAL CLICK INTENSIVE. My wrist hurt after playing a couple games. For days. If there is ANYTHING that can be clicked, MOO3 will make you click 5 times to accomplish it. Ouch. **GC - Normal clicking. Some decent keyboard shortcuts. Could have used a couple more, but way better than MOO3. --RESEARCH: *MOO3 has an extensive tree that is sometimes confusing and uninteresting. Click a category and hope you get something good. **GC has a large tree that is somewhat limiting. You will likely research everything  as the game progresses, but you can leap ahead in areas to gain a particular advantage over other races. Little guessing as to the benefits you get, and a single advance CAN help you turn the tide in a war. --STORY: *MOO3 had a story? **GC involves you with hints and tidbits as the game progresses - not rigidly canned like some games (oh, its turn 4 - time for the X-event), but very fluid and varied from game to game. --COMBAT: *MOO3 shines here for those that like tactical combat. The MOO2 and 3 games disappointed me from the MOO original due to not knowing exactly what ship helped, hurt, or lost/won you the game. MOO3 has a tactical maneuver element despite the other lack of detail. **GC has simplified combat. You immediately know if your ships suck, and why. There is no tactical maneuver element here; you move your ship into contact and combat is immediately resolved. --GRAPHICS: *MOO3 has flat, simple, and colorless graphics. Might as well have been a technical manual. Only the alien interaction had any color. **GC has lively colors everywhere. None are too bright. None are flat. A VERY appealing game to the eye. However, the graphics aren't the BEST or most advanced out there. Has more of a good arcade video-game feel to it. --GAMEPLAY: *MOO3 seemed to come down to every game being a click war against enemy spies. #&@* spies controlled the game and there was NO way to be "rid" of them, no matter how high you oppressed, no matter how many unassigned counter-operatives you had... whatever you spent years building, you would lose a tenth of everything to a spy with a bomb in one turn. VERY frustrating game. My wife offered to throw it away for me several times. **GC has been different each time so far. You can win by CULTURE, TECHNOLOGY, ALLIANCE, or CONQUEST. All are possible and likely. GC ALSO adds in an interesting twist to the gameplay. Often you are faced with ethical choices involving benefits and penalties that are often realistic and interesting. Your choices determine whether you are good, evil, or neutral. Research based on your moral standing becomes available too. The game mixes elements of Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, and every other famous sci-fi big-screen storyline in a well-balanced offering. My OVERALL review here is 5 stars. It earns it. The producer, Strategy First, is well known for offering improvements and updates to their games. There is already 2 updates out as I write this, and the game has only been out for a week. The game is well-priced and a much better entertainment than MOO3. If I had to break it all down to one small description, GC is smooth, streamlined, and fun.	1
I avoided this game for years simply because I heard a lot of bad reviews about it. Online Critics gave poor ratings. Many players complained about the player killing and the lag. My cousin always raved about this game, but I never tried it because it was $10.00 a month to play. Now that many games now charge a monthly fee to play I decided to try it. I feel like I was lied to. This game is one of the best games I have ever played, I can't understand how this game recieved such bad reviews. The depth in this game is unmatched. Many games copied Ultima Onlines skills and concept. Ultima Online is very underated. I can't believe games like Everquest and Diablo II get better ratings from online critics. What are these critics thinking! Everquest and Diablo II have great graphics, but the gameplay is very boring in those games and lacks very much depth. I use a dialup connection and the lag was not all that bad. On weekends and during busy hours the lag is bad, but overall it is not that bad. Lag in Diablo II was much worse I thought. The siege perilous shard and the Great Lakes shard were the funnest to play I thought. The siege perilous is the best shard to play on if you like PvP. Gameplay is close on that shard to what Ultima Online origonally was. I had a lot of fun on siege. The theif profession is very fun to play on that shard. No other game out can match the PvP experience Siege Perilous offers in my opinion. If you like crowds and like to see busy cities the Great Lakes server is the best server to play on I think. Britiana really feels like a city. During primetime there must be about a hundred players all hurdled around the bank trading. I thought before Diablo II had a great trading system, now I relize Ultima Online's is by far superior. The economy in this game I think is unmatched. Even though this game has less people playing than Everquest, I encountered a lot more people during gameplay than any other online game. The crafting is unmatched. People say DaoC is superior, I tried DaoC I think its overated. DaoC seemed too adventure oriented. The large problem with player killing has been fixed. Players that don't like pk's, can play on the Trammel Facet that is PvM oriented rather than PvP. The Mage I think is funner to play on Ultima Online verses many other games. Combat has a lot more to it in Ultima Online. Mage's chant spell words before they cast a spell and they have to use regents for each spell. Not all spells use the same regents. Cities really feel like cities in UO. They just seem to blend in more with the outside world, Everquest's cities feel like they are seperated from the rest of the world. I remeber one Online Critic gave Diablo II a 9/10 and Ultima Online a 6/10. I still puzzle over why this was. Diablo I & II player killing was just as bad. The mounts in this game are unmatched. Players can ride a wide assortment of animals. Ranging from deer - to dragons!	1
I used to be a fan of UO but now its just not worth it, the gameplay still keeps its goodness and that's why I gave it 2 starts and not 1. But the servers are getting worse and worse, and now it's just not worth paying 10 bucks a month for a game that is laggier than Diablo 2. Don't get me wrong this is a good game with good gameplay and great fun but the lag is destroying it. If they decide to fix the servers I will bring my review up to a 5. If they make the game free but keep the laggy servers then I will only change it to a 3 because that would prove that Electronic Arts are just too lazy and don't care enough about the players enjoyment of the game to fix anything and they would have basically just give up on the game. If you want a free online RPG with less lag then get Diablo 2. If you want an MMORPG with little lag then get Asheerons Call, Asherons Call 2, or Dark Age of Camelot.	-1
1. The new Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 game has gotten much harder. And now Wacky Worlds... what are customers asking for? Not wacky cities, none of that. Just medium challenging regular games. Unless some want it to be hard, Wacky Worlds is not for you. Neither is it for me. Just forget about it... This, just the RCT2 game will not be an ultimate seller like other simulation games. At least it is not..... gulp.... Sim City. Now that is a complicated game.	1
OK - the good news is - this seems to be worth =some= money. This expansion pack (you will need the original Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 to use this) adds a lot of new scenery like the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, the Eiffel Tower, and other scenery to make parks an international experience. There are almost 20 new scenarios, 50 new ride types, and about 250 new game elements, mostly scenery. OK - the bad news is - I don't think it's worth the current price of admission. A lot of the "new rides" are just re-designs of old coasters.  There's no new stores or other new goodies.  Still only the Scenario Editor allows you to use the mountain maker.  Many of the new scenery elements take up a lot of slots on the scenario editor.  For instance, the "Golden Gate Bridge" needs five (5) slots - thus taking up room that could be used for other park scenery. With this coming out so soon after RCT2, I can't help but ask if this was just a way to squeeze more dollars out of RCT fans.  I would have been much happier if these "extras" had been included with the RCT2 first disc.  Sure, we might have had to wait a little longer for RCT2, but we would have gotten a much more developed product.  This "extra" pack had to have already either been in development or already totally developed for the short time between RCT2 and the first expansion pack release date. I'll be watching carefully for any future RCT2 releases within a year - and see if they might include "Wacky Worlds" as an extra feature, just as they did with RCT1's "Loopy Landscapes" (which also included the add-ons from RCT1's "Corkscrew Follies"). Those who want to save money might want to wait till the end of the year, when either a third disc (with this second disc included) might be released, or the prices come down as they do for all video games. Recommended, but only for Roller Coaster Tycoon purists.	1
Infogrames has gone over the line. All these expansion packs are driving me crazy. If one more comes around I will be crazy. And look, Wacky Worlds is finally coming out. Besides my opinion, the game is a must have if RC2 was already bought. I own the original Roller Coaster Tycoon, the Cockscrew Follies expansion pack, Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, and I might just be waiting for this new game. Already in my shelf includes games I don't play. Why would this be needed. Infogrames is just doing something wrong.	1
Wow, I didn't know Chirs Sawyer(the company name and real person's name's the same) would plan to release a expansion pack for RCT2 so soon. I got RCT2 because I liked RCT1 and the expasion packs but two years of playing and it is true that it's getting a bit boring.   But who knows, this expansion pack might have something unique to play and I strongly recommend for people who really likes RCT2, but we'll see what kind of expansion pack this will be.	1
This is a great expansion!  Recommended for those who like RCT2 but wish there was more content.  Make sure you get the other expansion as well	1
This is a great game!!! Come on!  There is WAY more scenary and are WAY more rides to play with!  Some are complaining about the number of scenarios but the big thing is that you can create your own scenario and pack it with TONS of cool stuff and just play and play!	1
All I have to say is don't waste your time and money to buy this game. This add on is horrible. The company tried to hard to make this game and they really need to fix this game up. These add ons are just plain boring. If you want to try to make a better innovation pc game for the community, then I suggest you to fix up this game now. Stop ripping off people money and start fixing up this RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Wacky Worlds Expansion Pack!	-1
I am a huge total war fan, so for an expansion set of my favorite game to come out is obviously going to make me buy it.  What is great about the expansion is that if you have played a lot of the Medieval: total war, you will notice liitle things that have changed.  Of course you have the whole Viking Era, which is cool and all, but my favorite aspect of this is that three more factions were added to the original campaigns.  I think it is always great trying out a new faction.  Another cool new thing is that you are told in detail of your vices and virtues, which are rather interesting to say the least. It's hard for me to give less than 5 stars for a game I like so much, I guess that is why it deserves 5 stars.  I can't say I have any real upsets about the expansion...maybe price...  But hey, I did buy it, so price didn't matter too much.	1
When medieval total war hit the shelves I was elated. From the moment I played the demo, I fell in love with the game. Finally, a game that focuses on realism and the fine tactics of combat. Finally, a game with broad scope and yet a lot of depth too. Finally, a game that seemed to understand just what I had always wanted in a strategy game. Medieval was a great success, so needless to say, I was excited about this expansion. I just recieved the expansion in the mail today (5/8/03) and I'm happy to report that it's great! There's no denying it, most exapansion packs are rip-offs that you regret buying. Viking Invasion however, is well worth it's money to anyone who thurouly enjoys the original game. The premise of the pack is to turn back the clock to 793 AD, when the Vikings raided northumbria in britain. This marked the beggining of a reign of terror by the norsemen. At the same time, there were numerous small kingdoms struggling for control of the british isles. It makes for a very interesting and completely logical explansion campagne. You are now offered a new era to play in which will give you a completely new map (a map of britain) and several new civilizations. There are over 40 new units, most of which are pretty cool - most notabley berserkers, Huscarls, houscarles and fyrdman. The new campagne is both fun, and a bit more challenging than the previous one. You'll aslo be happy to see that there are now many more sieges than before, with villages and warrior halls being precursors to forts, keeps and castles. It's pretty cool, when assaulting a village there is no gate, just a stockade around a village filled with buildings where the enemy is. It's nice to finally see more combat inside actuall villages and cities, though it's not perfect (units have a bit of trouble navigating around buildings sometimes). The improvements the expansion pack offers also spill into the original game. This includes new playable civs in the original campagne as well as some new units. The real gem is the gameplay enhancements. which offer fire and flaming arrows, some tweaks and gameplay polishing, a new pre battle screen that REALLY makes a difference when you're decinding what to do before a battle, a new reinforcment screen to plan your reinforcements and some other stuff. All together if you still play and enjoy medieval, than go buy this right away! If you've already gotten tired of medieval, this MAY be enough to renew your interest, but it's still basically the same game. Pros: Flaming arrows and catipult shots, New pre-battle screen is a MUCH NEEDED addition, new reinforcment screen is helpful, the new campagne is a nice change and offers new fun and even more variety to the game, 40 new units, each of which is cool in it's own right, new buildings, the new campagne has village battles and multiple gameplay twaeks and changes that are really phat, the original campagne is not ignored, it gets many of the same improvements and 2 new civs and some new units too to round out a really good expansion! Disapointments: I wish the pre-battle system allowed you to see the vices and virtues of the generals, flaming missiles are automatic (you cant toggle or CHOOSE whether or not to use them), I wish they would have improved diplomacy a bit, I was hoping to see battering rams and siege towers but no.	1
In the last few years, the PC gaming industry has seen a wide variety of WWII shooters.  With good reason too -- they're fun!  Some titles have better multiplayer, some have better weapons, basically, all of them have their own pros and cons.  But if there was one WWII shooter that I would say does the best job on all angles of the game, it would be the popular Medal of Honor (MOH) series.  Not only is multiplayer a blast but the singleplayer campaign is a riot too!  I don't replay many games but I probably played the Medal of Honor Allied Assault singleplayer campaign at least three times.  Of course, like most shooters, if you want to experience online play at its best, you'll need a broadband connection to play on the largest servers and MOH has one of the largest communities of online shooters right now so there are plenty of games available 24/7.  All the best multiplayer formats such as objective, deathmatch, and one death limit matches are included and it's easy to find a specific map and type of game you'd like because of the community's gigantic size.  The best part of the Medal of Honor Deluxe set though is that it comes included with the first expansion in the MOH series, Spearhead.  This adds more multiplayer maps and a short singleplayer extension. As long as you enjoy a WWII setting, MOH is one of the best first-person shooters on the market right now and one of the best games on the PC in years.	1
This is the first person shooter experience that I have been looking for since I finished playing No One Lives Forever. Medal of honor has great graphics, great storyline and it isn't loaded with game killing bugs. The Omaha Beach segment is particularly interesting, since it manages to simulate the Normandy invasion quite accurately (After getting killed four times, I began to appreciate how hard surviving that battle must have been.) Well worth the cash.	1
This package contains two very popular PC games: MEDAL OF HONOR ALLIED ASSAULT, an its expansion pack, MEDAL OF HONOR ALLIED ASSAULT: SPEARHEAD. The first one, ALLIED ASSAULT is definetely one of the best first person shooters on PC. It starts off with the widely populer scene where you storm Omaha Beach on D-DAY, just like PS2' MEDAL OF HONOR FRONTLINE. However, it takes a very different path. MEDAL OF HONOR gives you a great feeling of being immersed in an actual war experience. Also, you have its expansion pack, SPEARHEAD. SPEARHEAD was another great first person shooter, but not quite as good as the first one was. It requires the original version to run, meaning the graphics and performance are indentical. All together, you have a great value. The graphics still hold up pretty well, and these two will take you a long time to beat. They are both single-player experiences, but are very immersive. If you do not own them, buy them. If you already own the first ALLIED ASSAULT, buying SPEARHEAD seperately might be a better choice. Console gamers who have played through the FRONTLINE should also check this out.	1
So, you're looking for a game the puts you in the cockpit of a fighter jet.  There are a few of them out there, and I have tried them all.  I own Ace Combat 4, Ace Combat, 5, Lethal Skies 1 & 2 and of course Aero Elite: Combat Academy.  I got bored with Ace Combat 4 & 5.  You point the plane in the direction you want to go... and you go.  Which is nice, but doesn't add anything to the realism of flying a fighter jet.  Lethal Skies 2 is a nice title, but when it comes to realism... Aero Elite has them beat.  Aero Elite will allow you to take off, fly, and land your plane.  I wanted this so bad in the other titles, but it's just not there.  I want realism... I can't say this enough!  In Aero Elite, you  control your landing gear, airbrakes, rudder and weapons selection.  G forces and stalls can become a problem when fighting the enemy.  This isn't a point and shoot flight game.  If you're looking for an arcade like flight game, look at the Ace Combat titles.  I will say this about Aero Elite, the training missions can get a little frustrating at times.  The thing about this though, is that if you try a mission without going through the training... you're in trouble.  Incoming missile from behind?  What do you do?  The bad guys have all been destroyed, but you have to land your F-14 on an aircraft carrier to complete the mission?  Should of done the training missions, and you will.  Scramble Missions; 2 player head to head dog fighting; 60+ aircraft including helicopters; Brilliant Graphics, and great sound... It's all here.  I bought the Playstation 2 for its flight games.  Xbox doesn't have anything worth mentioning, so I picked up a Playstation 2 and bought all the flight games for this platform.  I find myself playing Aero Elite: Ace Combat more than all the other titles.  This is a challenging game, but stick with it and you'll love it.	1
For the first time that i can recall, there is now a realistic flight sim on a game console...and that sim is Aero Elite.  This game gives you a far better sense of what it is like to fly and fight in a combat airplane.  Obviously, those too accustomed to the AC series (don't get me wrong, i'm a fan of that too!) won't like this game because there are so many other aspects that go into it than point the nose at something and shoot.  This game requires you to use ACM and tactics above all else, and actual missile evasion tactics.  Gunfire is as accurate as can be and you'll tear someone apart in a single quarter second burst.  Of course there are a few draw backs G-limit for example is the on-paper current limit, not actual airframe tested limit (a plane like the F-14 should be able to pull 9G, 7.34 under high load, and the F/A-18 should not have a limit of 7.5) but for these small faults, the game is amazing, second only in my mind to the archaic Fleet Defender PC game from '93 that still awaits an equal.	1
Aero Elite outclasses Ace Combat 4 in terms of realism and detail but sacrifices fun in the name of it. The weapons, for example, are exact to the real specs and number. You have to pay close attention to your speed and altitude when landing, especially if you're flying VTOL in a Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier. The vertical take-off and landing feature of the Rolls Royce Engine only engages at a specific airspeed. Going through the VTOL training really helps you learn the basic skills for flying the AV-8B Harrier. Unlike Ace Combat 4, you can pre-program your replay views before saving it and even choose a different background music. Not to mention, you get the whole replay for the entire length of the game! Ace Combat 4 only replays the last 4 minutes and you cannot save each individual replay movie. Aero Elite even lets you land any plane on a city freeway or on almost any flat surface you can find on the face of the Earth like parking the F-16 Falcon on that helipad in front of your house in the Snowy Mountains Mission. Try parking the huge F-15E inside the pyramid in the desert mission. Mastering the technique of landing the AV-8B Harrier on the LHA at sea can be hard to learn at first but you'll be proud once you get it right and to watch or show that perfect replay is almost enough reason to own this game. Not recommended for beginner pilots. Advanced pilots dare this!	1
Thank god I bought this at a store that has a money back return policy wiith receipt.  This game was one of the worst games I've ever played. To start, for a flying game to be any good you must first get some sense that you are flying.  Aero elite seemed to go out of its way to take that sense from you.  For perspective, I would say that Ace Combat 4 gives you a far better sense of flying.  While that game was not terribly realistic in that your plane could hold 50-70 missles, it is in every other way a far superior game and would give it 3.5 to 4.0 stars. Aero elite's graphics are Ok nothing great and certainly no better that Ace Combat 4's.  The controls are horrendous, from accelerating to decelerating, to the firing of missles, to just flying the plane around the screen. There is a great selection of planes, however, It's no fun to fly any of them because it doesn't feel like your flying any of them. It is a shame that in the middle of 2003 companies are still creating games that would have been better for the original Sega system from 10 yrs ago.  This game is worth between $1 and $5, no more.  Not even worth the $6 to rent.	-1
Being a lifelong combat aircraft buff, I was immediately attracted to this title. Graphics looked great, and the ability to fly 60+ aircraft (including some real rare birds the like F-104 and the F-86) made this game appear all the more like an outstanding title. Well kids, It is not. Thankfully, I rented this one before I bought it. My biggest complaint the the control, or lack thereof, especially in the training missions. Completing the training missions is required to unlock various aircraft. Training missions consist of things like take-off, landing, rolls, loops and so on. Later training missions involve combat maneuvering, formation flight, and weapons. There are also training modules involving rotary-wing (choppers) and VTOL aircraft. Sounds fun and involved, right? WRONG!!! The training requires you to be so precise in your control, that even the slightest mistake will cause you to fail and re-take the "test". Yeah, I know that the REAL jet jockeys and chopper drivers go through the same thing, ... Maybe I'm just whining. Also, while you are in "school" you can be "scrambled" to respond to airborne threats. You may be required to simply identify and unknown aircraft, or you may have to shoot him down. You never know when you get the call. That part was kind of cool, although the radio voice vectoring me to the target did get a bit annoying. Other than that, I must admit, there were a wide selection of aircraft (all with Japanese Air Force markings) and great graphics. On one hand, I have been known to complain about the Ace Combat series of fighter plane shooters, stating that they are painfully unrealistic. But, I guess that there can be an overdose of realistic, and (in my opinion) this game suffers because of it. But again, the myriad of aircraft (including combat choppers and heavy transports) gave this game a nice variety, and prevented me from giving the dreaded one-star review. I guess if you mastered the training portion, than this game would be a blast, but I suppose I just lost interest.	-1
Guilty Gear X2 is the sequel to the overlooked original.  This time around it features much deeper and strategic gameplay, with a few more characters, and a ton more modes.  This is a must have for anyone fond of the good old 2d fighters.  It has the best 2D graphics and animation on the market and abseloutely KILLS Capcom for visuals.  Check this one out for sure.	1
Guilty Gear X2. This is an unique fighting game not seen around much anymore. A lot of kids will undoubtedly take one look at this game and go (insert sterotypical blonde voice) "ewww, that is SO 1997". This game doesn't use flashy 3D megapolygons. But it has so much style and is so well animated that it doesn't need the high polygon count. Animations are crisp, fluent and pack tons of style. This game does use pixels, along with a few CG flashes here and there. The game looks and feels like a live action controllable anime. That's what makes this game look so great! It is similar looking to the older games like Marvel vs Capcom and all those good times we had at the arcades. However, this game truly does stand out. How so? This game has wild animation that NEVER rests in its background and in its characters. And each character is unique, adding huge variety. Everything from scary gothic-types with big scythes, to cute little 12 year old pirate girls with big anchors. Every character is either serious, hilarious, cool or just plain bizzare. Each character has their own style and will never, ever do the same things. I've noticed in other fighting games that developers like to rehash and use the same moves for characters. Look at Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, where Scorpion and Kenshi have the EXACT SAME SWORD MOVES. However, in this game, every character will do something different. Each character has true styles that will take some time to learn and master. Each character is balanced and well designed. Each combo is unique in this game. Allowing for long combos, flashy and brillant special attacks, and a new thing added to the fighting genre, the Instant Kill. Instant Kill moves are moves that are hard to pull off but do as their names say. They instantly kill the opponent in one hit! Like a MK fatality, except with a purpose. It does make this game fun as it makes battles able to turn around in a heartbeat. Controls are solid here and the moves are well designed. They are easy to learn but hard to master. Easy enough for a newcommer to pick up the basics but hard enough for players to polish their skills. Gameplay shines in this game; every single battle is fast and furious. This game is very engaging and fun. You can recover, counter, dodge, counter-dodge, and do other things in this game. Skilled players will be able to counter a 12 hit combo, but even better players will be able to counter the counter. It is fun! The soundtrack in this game is excellent. Every sound stands out and the music is wonderful. If you're sick of psuedo-temple hymns and techno bubble pop music in your fighting games, then GGX2 will be your best friend. The soundtrack rocks, with a good variety of hard rocking music fitted to the situations. There isn't any cheesy synthetic pyro-rock here either. Each song has its own hard edge and is tailored to the characters' personalities. Even the song titles fit the characters. The sound is very very catchy and some people would even consider buying the soundtrack to this game. Now, every fighting game has its ordinary shopping list of game modes. Guilty Gear X2 delivers the list and more. Arcade, Story, vs 2p and CPU, Medal mode, mission mode, and a few others make the variety and originality in this game bleed through. Story mode allows you to get to know each character better. And it has tons of replay value, as each character has three different endings to unlock. There are 20 normal characters. That's around 60 endings in total! Some may be dissapointed on the way Story mode is presented. It is told through anime style slides with audio dilagoue spoken in japanese with english subtitles. The stories themselves range from serious, funny or freaky. All the ends of the story spectrum are here and they will entertain you. The stories are well told. Also, the mission mode does offer a ton of challenge. This is something for experienced players to strut their stuff. The difficulty level on all modes are ranged and can be set for suitable levels for newcomers, or just plain ludicrious for those expert elite. It's a great game that does adjust to your skill level. This is a truly great game. With its crisp anime-type style, interesting, balanced, and entertaining characters, great gameplay options, rocking soundtrack, entertaining storyline, an adjusting difficulty, and its new twists and spins on a dying genre, I would suggest this game to any fighting game fan. You will truly get your money's worth with this game. It almost makes you want to say "Forget polygons, gameplay is still king!"	1
Guilty Gear X2 is a 2D fighting game that boasts gorgeous anime graphics, detailed backgrounds, great fight combos, and a soundtrack straight out of the 80s of rock. First, the graphics. They are just amazing. The characters move just like anime cartoons (and with better animation than many out there) - complete with billowing smoke, ripple effects, zaps of lightning, and much more. Being a 2D fighter you can't move into the scenery, but the backgrounds are well detailed and match the characters nicely. The fighting styles are quite detailed, each is unique. Characters fight with anchors, guitars, yoyos, jumprope chains, and much more. The game is definitely themed to 80s rock and metal music. The background music jams and was done by great bands. The characters themselves are named things like Axl and Venom. The fighting gameplay is great. You can play against other players, or in a variety of single player modes that are engrossing and challenging. There are numerous special moves including killer moves that can be done at any time in the game (if you can get the button combos down!) Story mode is around 10 battles, but on the downside you can't save. So once you start a sequence, you can't save partway through and restart it later. Some battles can be incredibly hard until you figure out the right combo to win, so you can be stuck in one spot for an hour or more. Still, a game should be challenging sometimes! Also, most of the dialogue is in Japanese, although they do subtitle the important parts in English. Even though it's in Japanese, some of the taunts can get very repetitive. Highly recommended for any fighting game fan, especially for those who have another human around to play multiplayer with!	1
I'm gonna try to keep this short and sweet, this game totally ROCKS!, its 2d at its best, the graphics and colors are so viberant and the game play is so sweet with awesome combos that can be chained to other combos, needless to say this game is no walk in the park, with each level the game becomes harder and harder to beat so it will challenge your skills and if thats not enough the fun factor will leave you hungry for more, this game is a must have for fighting fans alike, totally recommended.	1
This in my opinion is the best 2D fighter on the market,far superior to the likes of Marvel V.S. Capcom 2. There are some price gougers trying to sell this game for close to 200 bucks for new and sealed but in one month (August 2007) the whole gulity gear set is coming in one package for under 40 bucks (this game included).Sort of like what Need for Speed and the Devil May Cry series has done. When this set releases the value of the Guilty Gear X2 sealed games is going to drop from about 150-200 bucks to a mere 10 bucks or so if that. Let these price gougers watch their games values drop to nearly nothing and wait to purchase the full set next month for $39.99	1
I still rank Guilty Gear X2 with high marks but I lack the appreciation of execution this game has except for the music-- the music I'll admit is damn good and the graphics are a huge boost from what Guilty Gear (the original) was but I'm disappointed in the change GG has gone through, becoming the X Series. In a way, I don't even consider the X series a part of the whole Guilty Gear deal but that it was a different direction for Ishiwatari Daisuke's projecto move around in-- it all became a part of the whole pop culture deal rather than the underground swagger it had going on back in the late 90's and seemed to have appealed more to a market sense of things than just the pure gaming aspect of a good challenging game (I mean for crying out loud, they made it HARDER to execute the Instant Kill 'Destroyed' move).  I only play the X-series of GG to compensate for a more eye-candy gesture of gaming as well as enhanced sound quality and music but GG is still my most highly regarded jewel than what X or X2 (XX: Midnight Carnival if you will) could ever be.  If you're a GG fan, get the game I suppose but it really doesn't have that same appeal regardless of what you may think; the whole spiel just doesn't quite fit for me, but that's me. This may seem like I'm putting this game down more than I should be praising it but again, in design the game is great, outstanding even, but the concept runs short and 'sold out' as far as a good game goes.  When Guilty Gear first came out, I was stoked and hoping for a sequel that could turn GG over as a world-class hit in the gaming scene... The X-series came out and ... that's all it just about it, come out but it didn't turn anything over as I thought it would-- so I'm still waiting for that TRUE Guilty Gear sequel despite the cashcowing to whoever's selling the game out now... was Atlus? Now Sammy? Now it's someone else I believe right? Times change but I still hold hope for that one moment when GG will make a true return to its roots-- if Daisuke Ishiwatari is reading this and can read English, I hope you read them intently because a diehard fan is still waiting for a raging comeback to what I acclaim as one of the greatest fighting game franchises of all time. Period.	1
Guilty Gear X2 is an exceptional sequel to Guilty Gear and Guilty Gear X. Though the sound quality of the music sounds like it changed, it seemed louder in Guilty Gear X, but it does not effect X2 at all. The ganplay is still the same except of the addition to special moves like BURST. Also they changed the moves of some characters mostly downgrades of some of there original moves which kind of made me mad but they just gave there original moves from the previous games intact to the EX versions of the characters. Now there is a story mode which I found really intersting, a mission mode which is diificult at some times or most of the time, M.O.M mode where you fight against every character once and when you inflict damage to them medals pop out of them which you need to collect, and there is also a gallery mode. The standard modes like Arcade, VS, and Survival are still availible. There is also an addition of four new characters which I liked, but I wanted at least four more. They also brought back some old ones Like Justice. I guess Robo-Ky is a new character also. But yeah overall its worth owning and playing.	1
This game has the coolest style. The graphics are awsome and the characters are very different. fighting with weapons rules and the specials are neat. The sound rocks and it looks like one of those stylized fights you'd see in movies or cutscenes, but you are controlling them.	1
Guilty gear is my favorite fightings games and one of my favorite games in general! anyone who has fallen pray to the capcom empire should brake away and try somthing new! before i played guilty gear I loved capcom Vs snk 2, good character selection, graphics, music, etc.  however i stoppd playing soon after I bought it! Why? because Ryu, Ken and Terry have been used over and over along with the same tired fighting system.after playing Guilty gear for a few MONTHS now i recently purchased Capcom vs snk and i realized that the game is not fluid at all! I gonna take a big risk and i will say that Capcom vs snk sucks! compared to this. TAKE MY ADVISE AND BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!	1
this game is very very fun i found myself glued to the t.v i like how you can hit the balls everytime you swing the bat the other baseball games are stupid this is the ultimate baseball game its simple and fun very cool if you like baseball get this game	1
I am so happy I got this game. I know it is outdated and all that but I am a HUGE Inuyasha collector.. at least I'm trying to be, can't always afford everything there is but this was definitely worth it. I've been wanting it since I was little.	1
I love this game because:  1)  My sister and I would play it a lot, it brings back fond memories.  2)  The voice acting is completely Japanese, there was no English dubbing done here.  This really adds something to the game, for me.  3)  The music.  The music in the Inuyasha series is just wonderful~!  4)  Play as your favorite characters.  And use their special moves such as Miroku damaging women by rubbing their backsides, hahaha.  Hilarious.  (Also annoying if you're on the receiving end of such a move!  Like "I WAS JUST KILLED BY GETTING MY BUTT RUBBED?!  But still, HILARIOUS.)  5)  The storyline is simple but cute, and the animated sprites are friendly and well done.  I especially like Naraku's palace with the soul collectors flying in the background, behind the windows, as it was seen the episode Kikyo was kidnapped by Naraku.  :)  6)  Unlockables!  7)  You can play as Shippo!  '  (haha, he's too cute!) (Kirara should have been a playable character as an unlockable, too....)  8)  Mini-games.  Examples are: breaking a giant rock to find Sacred Jewel Shards, defeating Naraku's venomous wasps (and saving Shippo from them, or tiny Kirara if you are playing as Shippo), and defeating Jaken and his Two-Headed Staff.  Mastering these can be difficult but doing well is crucial if you want to unlock everything there is to see in this game.  What I don't like about this game:  Well, there's just limited movement, and limited attack choices.  Defending can be difficult, and you can only play with the D-Pad (which is to be expected of a game this old).  But it's still a terrific must-have for Inuyasha fans.  '	1
If you've read my review over Marvel vs. Capcom 2 then you know I have given it the title if Possibly The Best, After playing this game I decided I had to review it that way I would have both ends of the fighting games world. Amazon Reviewers love this game so my ranking is going to take a hit but, so be it someone has to state the obvious about this game. As said in the last sentence Amazon reviewers just love this game reason is, they're Inuyasha fans. Don't get me wrong I love Inuyasha and own a collection of the DVD's; I'm just not a blind leader of the hanyou I guess. For some reason the plot gets a lot of praise, I for one have no idea why. Shippou and Kagome fight because... Kagome runs out of snacks, yes folks, the people at Bandai really put their heads together for this plot. Yeah you're collecting shards and yes they have a little explanation before you start fighting, does that really count? That's all from the show, and as soon as the little explanation to you collecting shards is over and you actually start fighting the plot disappears, the story does not unfold at all. This is a fighting game however so bad plot is extremely forgivable. Then there are the controls... which are way too simple. People may list simple controls under the heading of good things about the game but me, not if they're this simple. I've played RPG's with more complex controls. Characters seemed limited with a low number of moves and special moves that are way below spectacular, extremely below. The difficulty of this game is just amazing; buy this game and less than 15 minutes later it's possible to already have beaten the game with at least one character, maybe less than that. Characters look horrible, why wasn't there an Inuyasha game for the PS2 to be brought to our shores? Is this just a game to try and squeeze the PSX for all it's worth? The game does look thrown together. Couldn't they have at least translated? The only good thing I can think of about this game is Dream Fairy Tale and the fact that yes its Inuyasha.	-1
The game is very fun 2 play. If u like the show ull want this. The game has pretty good graphics and good gameplay. It has the storyline of the series which is very good. U get 2 play as many diff characters. There are many great features for this game. Its a must buy.	1
I decided to rent this(Thinking it was just another piece-o-[stuff] game Bandi put out just to sell, like DBZ Ultamate Battle 22), But yet it was suprisingly good.  And the game was subtitled, instead of dubbed(The american voices are good, but not as good, and as into it as the Japanese Voices). Pros: A suprisingly good Battle system Has the whole inuyasha cast of main characters It's pretty fun collecting juel shards Characters have 3 good moves, then one very strong attack If you love the stories and stuff, then the replay value may be high 2 player mode is pretty fun at times Sometimes funny was how Some character ends up fighting each other(Like when Kagome didn't have no treats for Shippo) Cons: Can't Bandi for once in their lifetime leave the 2D graphics to Street Fighter When I put the game on normal, it felt like they were on hard Characters could at least move their mouths while talking Well, I love Inuyasha the show, and I love this game.  If you love Inuyasha, then don't hesitate to pick up this game	1
I don't give a flip if it is 2D graphics!  I love InuYasha.  I don't personally like fighting games but hey...it's niffty, it's thrift, it's InuYasha, and it has ACTUALLY been released in the US unlike more than half of the Anime games. It's one of those things to add to your collection of Anime junk/collection wheter or not you really like the show or not, but I find it's worth it cause I love the characters (most of 'em anyway.) I recomend it, but whether you (the reader) will buy it is your choice.	1
As a rather big fan of comics, especially X series... This is just another in a long line of disappointments. I have never found a Marvel game worth the $ you shell out for it. If you really must have this, wait a few months or find it used. I gave this 2 stars because the graphics are pretty nice, but thats where that ends. If you are a hardcore fan, then maybe this is for you but if not, just wait or go get something else.	-1
This game is hot as hell. The graphics are really tight,The  controls are just the same. I've followed Wolverine's storyline for 13 years, and this storyline is brilliant, and accurate to the comic book series, thanks of course to Larry Hama, who contributed to the game and has been a Wolverine writer for years. The excitement is intense and will keep you addicted for hours at a time. You use stealth and jump out of the shadows at enemies and gut them with your claws. You can use over a dozen spectacular looking combos to finish off a few enemies at a time, each combo more brilliant looking than the last one. On one of them, you can throw two enemies up in the air and impale them on yourclaw like a shikobob. The battles with the big bosses are simply awesome. You get to throw down with Sabretooth (twice), The Juggernaut, Wendigo (one of the coolest battles), Lady Deathstrike, and Magneto. Mark Hamill does his coolest performance since Star Wars as the voice of Logan, and Patrick Stewart is sharp as ever as Professor X. It's his trademark character, he probably thinks he is Professor X. This is Tenchu - Wrath of heaven, Syphon Filter, and Metal gear solid 2 stirred into one game and I can honestly say that I think it will be the biggest game of the year, a good rival to Grand theft auto Vice city. I hope that this isn't the last Wolverine solo adventure game, He is the coolest superhero ever, even cooler than Spiderman, Superman, Batman and The Hulk. Anybody who gets into this will definitely be addicted to it, take my word for it. I have plenty more great things to say  but then this review would be too long for anyone to read through. Wolverine rules!	1
I have seen a first hand look at this game and it looks good.  It will help me pass the time while I wait for the real great x-men game in december.  This game is the second instalment to the gameboy version.  I am pre-ordering it as soon as I can.	1
i like this playstation 2 videogame alot mark hamill voices wolverine i was expecting hugh jackman & patrick stewart voices professor xavier the game goes a little more beyond the X2 movie	1
The thing is, there are so many superhero games around that sometimes it's hard to choose the right game. For me this game was right enough, i like very much the character wolverine, and nothing can make you feel more like wolverine as this game, not even the so over rated and over priced marvel's ultimate alliance.  In this game you can sheath and unsheath the adamantium claws anytime in the game, you can use your heightened senses to do almost anything (is like using the force but amazingly better), you can track enemies looking for their footprints or smelling them, and the most amazing thing is that you can surprise them and slash them with incredible finishing moves. Great graphics (looks like a tony hawk game), the sound (well that is how i thought wolverine would heard), the voice acting is superb, the game is very simple yet very complex and has enough to keep you busy.  Why only 4 stars? well, i never wondered how hard was to be wolverine, well, i can tell you, it's hard, very hard indeed, but that is also good 'cause it gives you the feeling that you're a superhero but that you aren't inmortal, yes, you've the healing factor (amazingly orchestrated by the way) but mines, bullets and other deadly stuff are just that, deadly. I've read something in the other reviews that said that bosses were fun and easy, well, i can tell you that the first was quite hard and the second was frustrating (i won't tell you who it is without spoiling the game for you).  I just loved this game when i have played it on the pc a long time ago and i was in love with it, i couldn't advance in it 'cause the game was choppy at that time but maybe that was because of my computer (you know all that stuff about the proper video card, the proper ram...) and from my experience with need for speed i knew that this one has to be better on the ps2, and it is a lot better 'cause it doesn't have all the glitches of the pc game.  This is the game, i love this game, but i'm a wolverine die hard fan, i can tell you that hulk (any of the two) is a better game than this one and more elaborated, but being wolverine just like wolverine, well this game does it, you're logan, the wolverine, and you have with that all the stuff included, the superhero glorious moments and the suffering moments also. Just like that, it's a must have if you have at least one comic book of wolverine in your house or if you like the character. But one thing... the game is hard and sometime frustrating (4 stars for that on the fun).	1
My favorite super hero is Wolverine and I really was looking forward to this game, it's Okay. The Fighting style is a bit boring and the only exiting moves are the finishing moves. After a fight it takes some time to heal depending on how much life that you lose: if it's mnimum, on average I'd say mabe about a few seconds, but if you're on the brink of death you'll have to wait a minute or two, or even five sometimes. THe bosses are fun and easy, but they start to get boring after a while. I would reeccomend this game for wolverine fans	1
This game is pretty hard & challanging. it took me almost an hour just to defeat Sabertooth. It is a fun game and it does get frustrating at times. There is this one level in act two where you can't get noticed or the game will be over, and that level is pretty hard. But i have enjoyed it so far. And i'm a big X-Men fan. So if you like the X-Men this will be a game that you'll like. And this game dosen't go buy the movie at all. Well if you rent it enjoy	1
i really think this game is decent considering that it is a product of a blockbuster movie, which in the past haven't lived up to their movie success. anyhow this game is nice, i do think this game is hard, i suggest that you rent it if you don't have alot of patience for games. i am content with the game because i loved the movie, so therefore i purchased it. if you are unsure RENT IT! peace	1
This game is great and follows the story line pretty close. the characters look more like they do in the comic book and not like they did in the movie. You can unlock all of wolverines outfits and use them whenever you want, you can also unlock files about each character and movies that tell more details of the story line. The only two things that I didn't like Were that The difficulty level is pretty steep and some of the bosses take alot of time to figure out how to beat them. You don't just attack any of the bosses, they all require some special way of beating them. this is a cool idea but you have to wait for the word "strike" to appear at some point and on sabertooth #1 I died three or four times before it came on the screen once,and without it popping up you cant beat him. also after you beat the game there isn't enough replay value, so its basically either keep playing the levels over or play the dumb challenges. probably worth owning but renting it and beating it might be adequate.	1
X2: Wolverine's Revenge...... Although I'm a big Comic Book fan, I must confess that I'm not too big on Wolverine. Don't get me wrong, Wolverine definitely kicks booty in comicdom....no doubt about that. It's just the whole mutant storyline thing just doesn't grab me by the short and curlies. Yet, after playing X2: Wolverine's Revenge, I've decided to reconsider those feelings. That being said, what do I have to say about the game? Well, first off, it's definitely going to change your mind, yet again, about comic book properties being made into videogames. Like Spider-Man before it, it's definitely changing the perception of how a comic-book property be made into a game. For this to be your Basic Brawler(much like Fighting Force, but better), it has alot more going for it than just brawling. Certain areas require you use your animal instinct while others require you use stealth. At any rate, you have to use some strategy to make it through this game as some areas are downright cunning. Along the way, you encounter the likes of Sabretooth, Wendigo and others and battle to the finish so prepare yourself for some epic battles. Developer Genepool did an excellent job with the game. They stayed true to the Weapon X storyline and delivered a game any Marvel fan would be proud of. The graphics are some of the best I've seen on the PS2. There's even alot of incentive to replay the game over again in collecting all the comicbooks to unlock original Wolverine costumes, collecting dogtags to unlock more. I definitely give a hearty recommendation to all for X2:Wolverine's Revenge to be added to your PS2 library. It's one that shouldn't be missed by Comicbook fans and gamers alike.	1
I [got], thinking it would be a great game to play and to be able to control Wolverine. It's not. Sure, you can use your claws, but you'll find yourself not using them most of the time so you can regain health during combat. You see, there are two main ways to regain health on this game: finding health icons and pulling your claws back in. When your claws are out, it does a little more damage to the enemy, but you also won't regain your health. The combot controls are sloppy, and hard as hell when you're facing multiple enemies. You basically tap "X" or whatever attack you want to use over and over and hope you'll get a stab at them, which is very hard to do. It's also hard to jump away from the enemy, which is also very frustrating. When you hit someone enough times, "STRIKE" will appear at the bottom of the screen. At this point, you can K.O. them if they're weak, bu if they're strong, you'll probably end up losing the fight. You'll die over and over again in the same part, and get frustrated, and if you're like me, just put down the control and leave the game alone and never play it again. The graphics basically suck. No other word can describe them. They look like something from a Nintendo 64 game. This game had potentioal, but not enough belief in it from the creators. I hope they make a "Pyro's Revenege", but make it good...	-1
This game was pretty cool. Mark Hamill does the voice of Wolverine. Only a few other X-Men, Colosiss, Rouge, Professor X and Cyclopes. When you face Magneto he repeats the same lines over and over,also he is hard to find. Magneto and Omega Red have been released from a maximum security prison, and you as Wolverine must find and fight them. My only complaint is that Omega Red is not in the game other than being released. So they will make another one that will have Omega to fight. The graphics are cool and the game play is good. There are extra movies that are cool. I recomend this.	1
I love Wolverine I love the X-Men. This is the best related Game I have played on a consol. But the graphics could have been much better (they actually look like Nintendo 64) I like the storyline it makes a lot of sence if you like the comics. However it has nothing to do with the Movie. I wish that they would have polished it up a bit more and released it when the movie comes out on DVD. Some of the levels are way too hard without help and there should have been some checkpoints to even this out. I give the gameplpay a 3 but since it is Wolverine he gets a 4.	1

The grand children love the store line and many stages of the game.  The graphics were lovely and the adventure was enjoyable to explore.	1
my kids love this game. they are nemo fans. i am happy to find something good for them. arrived on time and in great shape	1
My special needs daughter has a very good way of solving problem visually. Even with us helping her on this game it got to be overwhelming. A good game but was too hard for her.	1
I purchased this game for my granddaughter, who just loves to play this game!  Very cute and just an addition to the original video.  Recommend this game to any boy or girl.  Great pricing, quality and fast delivery response appreciated!	1
A classic game of the story. A difficult for kids game to maneuver through the game. But still a really good game.	1
I recently traded in OLD Atari consoles and games and picked up the PS2 Slim, love it! Now I can play all our old PS1 & 2 games with my gr.girl! I picked Finding Nemo up cheap, used at our local game store and it's well worth it!!  Very fun, easy to pick up and play.  I started playing it when I got home and before I knew it i was on level 5, that eve my gr.girl came over to stay and she's now 2 levels ahead of me! We love our little competitions, it tickles her when she gets ahead of me in games that are only 1 player.  We each have our own block on the memory card and just take turns playing! I try to pick up games that not only I might enjoy, since she's not here everyday, but games she will enjoy when she is here. She informed me this is one of her favorite games now, she's nine, in 4th grade, to give anyone an idea of what age group will enjoy this!  But then, i'm 52 and I enjoy it also!  Some of the missions we've had to repeat a couple times before getting throught them, so there is some level of difficulty to it.  And for me, some are harder due to the fact I can not see 3-D with vision in only 1 eye, that makes it a little more difficult getting thru some of the places, but still a great game and worth buying.  Also I love the movie cut-scenes, makes you feel you are actually playing a part in the movie.  My 4 star rating is only becuz of the whole 3-D thing. Otherwise, it's a 5 star game!	1
My family and I LOVED the movie Finding Nemo, and I *finally* got around buying this game for my son (age 8) the other day.  Unfortunately, he has had to call me into the room *repeatedly* to help him get through some of the levels. He gets frustrated and visibly upset (surely all that adrenaline isn't good for kids?!) and it was making my heart race, too. Most of the sections (he's on Level 6) involve a race of some sort or going through 2D platforming mazes (think Crash Bandicoot).  Some of the graphics are truly excellent, but not for small children. There are scenes with Bruce the shark chasing and trying to eat Nemo and Dory as you navigate them through minefields and in the sub. The music sounds pretty threatening, too.  Personally, I love PS2 games aimed at kids (e.g. Ice Age 2, Curious George, the Spyro series, etc.), but this game is repetitive and aggravating. Fighting against the current for some of the games makes it difficult and frustrating...which is decidedly unfun.	-1
Finding nemo is a game for the whole family young and old alike will enjoy this game. I sure did it's pretty fun. and the graphics are sweet.	1
My mother picked this game up for my 3 year old son for Christmas and it is just too hard for him.  He is fairly good with video games such as Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper, and the whole Spyro series etc.  However this game is just too hard for him to master just yet.  My 10 year old daughter can play it but struggles with it.  Even when I play it I find myself struggling with some of the levels.  The controls are a bit difficult until you get adjusted to them and even after playing it for a while I still have trouble getting through some of the rings I need to swin through.  It's a challenging game and the graphics are really good but beware of the gaming level of the person you are buying it for.	1
This game is extremely hard!!!Somehow though,i manged to beat it. The controls are horrible,same with Brightness!! And the voices are totally off,The Gill in the game sounds NOTHING like William Dafoe!!(i might have spelt that wrong.) Probably the only good thing is the Graphics. The two hardest levels are probably the jellyfish one and where you have to follow Bruce. When your ollowing Bruce the tides push you away from the rings and if you even miss 4,HE EATS YOU!! It's really hard to manuver in the jellyfish level because some of the jellyfish are duds!!so not fair!!! Only buy this game if your A Finding Nemo addict like i am.	1
I actually haven't seen the movie yet, but this game certainly made me wanna see it bad. The fact that it came with a free movie ticket helps, too... This game is gorgeous. The animation is absolutely amazing, and it blends well with clips from the movie. Every stage is different, and you never seem to get bored (and trust me, I get bored easily with games). It's colorful, full of action, and the characters are adorable! If you have kids, you HAVE to get this game. It will keep them interested for days! I definitely recommend Finding Nemo.	1
i purchased the action replay for gamecube after seeing screens of the secret "test" worlds for the legend of zelda: the wind waker. i was disappointed to discover that the codes i wanted weren't pre-loaded into the hardware, meaning i had to manually input them. luckily, the action replay is extremely user-friendly, making even the longest codes easy to input. it's also great if you play "animal crossing". who has the time to compile 800,000 bells to pay off your final loan? i don't. you'll also be able to unlock the ultra-secret "legend of zelda" and "super mario brothers". all in all, the action replay is extremely easy to use, and if i've never had a game crash using any of their codes. highly recommended.	1
Good	1
Very  pleased	1
I was a little disappointed when this arrived and I realized that it only worked for the GameCube. Before I buy anything, I research it through reviews and videos, but when I saw GameCube and "works with the wii" too, I was excited. I thought I had a 2-for-1 cheat device for both systems. So I'm giving it four stars bc it arrived as promised and in new condition.	1
Best cheats money can buy on gamecube and wii	1
I got all the soul calibur 2 cheats because of this device.	1
This newer model of the action replay has no custom functions or even code entry. It can only use what's pre programmed on it and nothing else.	-1
Best collection of games and working action replay ever.	1
This thing is cool, but it's not as useful as a Game Genie or a Gameshark would have been. There's 1 problem with it: the codes are already on the disc and you can't add any more. I've found codes for Gamecube games that I can't add to the disc, and that's why I think it is inferior to a Game Genie or Gameshark. I have stated previously that there are no codes for Zelda: Twilight Princess on the disc. I was mistaken. The game is listed as THE Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess instead of just Legend of Zelda or Zelda like the others, so I've been missing them the whole time I've had this thing. I just found them today. Overall, I'm pleased with the Action Replay, but I still wish I could upload codes to it.	1
My kids loved this thing! They wear it out!!! You certainly get your money's worth out of those old games you have laying around!	1
Good products	1
Worked as intended.	1
i had to reorder this because errors but i won't say anything bad. it's going to be a lot of fun messing around with gamecube titles on this disc.  i've wanted one for so long but couldn't get the chance to buy one. i totally recomend this to Gamecube fans like myself. the Gamecube is my favorite Nintendo system	1
I think it is a great game....very good graphics...my friends and I enjoy playing it, and would recommend it highly..	1
Game froze every time I entered "Create" mode. What can I say? I'm a creativity nut. This was even after I cleaned the disc. Let's just say, it's no wonder that there were only 2 Raw games and, altogether, 11 Smackdown games, from Smackdown 1 on PS1 through Smackdown Vs. Raw 2011 on PS2. The Smackdown series was always superior!	-1
My most favorite wrestling games. I wish Microsoft will allow the playing of Original XBOX games on the XBOX ONE	1
There are a few glitches in the game. And some things that are kind of random, but overall I enjoy playing this game with friends. Need to make an updated version of this game.	1
It has issues every now and again but it has a ton of cheats and so far they all work and don't break the game. Just sometimes it resets the Wii and sometimes refuses to read the game disc you're applying cheats to. But if you try again it'll work eventually.	1
son loves it	1
Thank you SO much! My friend borrowed my disc, and his girlfriend had a fight with him, and broke it! He bought me a new one, and it has more details than the one I had! Thank you!	1
This is the old version of the GC Action Replay, if you only play mainstream games you'll be fine, but if you try to use this  with more obscure games or imported games via free-loeader, it won't work.	1
Great product again from codejunkies and no failing here either and works with my gamecube games and system. Has codes but not enough.	1
This game is actually extremely fun when you get to know how to play it. This game is one of those games where it is hard to make an actual review about it, so i will make it in PRO/CON format.  Pro:  1. Graphics are amazing  2. Controls are fairly easy to master (in a good way)  3. Up to date superstars (at least when the game was made)  4. Many wrestlers to choose from including divas (^^)  5. Many different gameplay types that include ones such as Hell in a Cell, Battle Royal, Royal Rumble, TLC, (Tables, Ladders, Chairs) ladder match, hardcore, single, tag team and much more.  6. Every single paperview arena possible also including the Smackdown/Raw arena.  7. Realistic  CON:  1. Not enough submissions  2. Not very in-depth create a character mode  3. Referees can sometimes count extremely slow making it hard to pin your opponent.  4. No online capabilities  Now that Wrestlemania 21 is out, i would definetely go with that if you were to pick a wrestling game, but this game is definetely worth adding to your WWE game collection!	1
useful	1
Item was exactly as described, prompt delivery and well-packaged!	1
I bought this as a gift for my mom who own a GameCube.....she loved it......and it was brand new when I got it	1
After playing this game, I felt that it is definitely an improvement over the first "RAW" title on XBOX. However, there could still be a little more improvement made to enhance the game. The good part of the game: more wrestlers, you can find most of the wrestlers wrestling in this time to be in the game and the good thing is you can edit their costume to update them. GREAT GREAT CAW mode, RAW 1's create a wrestler mode was definitely lacking, you creat big ugly looking wrestlers that just look like real wreslter wresling a doll, in this model NO MORE, you can upload your own music and make your own Titantron, although in that field it was still a tiny bit lacking because there is only certain moves you can show in the titantron. Moves: there were alot new moves added, and even if you are creating a wrestlers whose move is not in the selection, you can probably find something like it. Now the downside, there are still UGLY UGLY models of wrestlers in the game. Triple H was ugly in RAW 1, they have fixed that problem but if you look at the noses of Billy Kidman and Goldberg in this game you would think Triple H in RAW 1 model was actually detailed. Lack of variety of matches: RAW 2 definitely has more types of matches than RAW 1 where it was either Pin only, submission only, and hardcore, but RAW 2 still just stuck with the most basic of basics of matches (table, ladder, tlc, hell in a cell, cage, handicap, battle royal, and royal rumble) they did not come up with anything creative like Smack Down did. Stupid AI: sometimes computer gives you a good match, other times computer stands around and look at you, other times when you almost beat the opponent they charge at you with rampage of attacks that will keep you down, other times they just pin you OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER AGAIN! Ladder Matches are also very difficult to win (TAP LIKE CRAZY!)Sound: there still isn't any commentary, the annoying music in the back is irritating, and the wrestlers somewhat sound alike. Storyline: there basically isn't a story line, the part where it says wrestlers personalities tells it all, you find ones with opposite personalities and it is real hard to challenge someone to a match right off the top. Overall, this still brings the thrill of a wrestling game, but it is still lacking in some fields, but it still cuts it if you are just playing matches not trying to discover features. Graphics: 7.5 Sound: 7.0 Gameplay: 9.0 Storyline: (not much storyline so Ima skip this catagory) Replay Value: 9.0 Overall: 8.125	1
C'mon guys, this game isn't that bad. Sure, Smackdown kicks its ass, but still its better the Wrestlemania, give that much credit. The graphics could be better, but they aren't horrific, and the souund and match-types aren't bad either. If you have a Ps2, get Smackdown, but if you have an X-Box and settle for it, you can rent raw 2 first. Rent it before buying! Wrestlemania gets old and boring, however Day of REckoning is gunna be kick-ass, even though Smackdown 6 will whip their ass again!!!	1
I can just imagine the meeting that led to the making of this newer GameCube Action Replay. Boss: Alright people, we need a way to make me... er... I mean the company more money. What's a cheap easy way we can do that? Employees: **Thinking quietly** Idiot Employee: Ooh, I've got a great idea! What if we take our old amazing product, the Action Replay Max for the GameCube, and make it so that our buyers can no longer input their own codes! Boss: That's the dumbest, most shameful way of making money I can think of! Great idea!  =__=  SHAME ON YOU CODEJUNKIES! This version of AR does not allow users to put in their own codes. Oh, so you wanted to buy an Action Replay to play as Amy or Chaos 0 in SA2B like I did? Too bad! You have to deal with the codes you're given! That also means that if your game isn't even listed on the disc then you're totally screwed, because you don't even have the cruddy selection of codes you're given with the other games on the disc. The only way around this is to buy a copy of the GameCube AR Max that comes with a memory card for saving your new codes, which is rare and not currently in production. Prepare yourself for a hefty price tag ($100+) if you've got your heart set on one. This is made even more shameful due to the fact that other discontinued consoles (PS2) still have an AR Max in production, so you can add new codes on those, but not this one.  The only reason this isn't a one star review is because what codes you are given work well, without crashing, and there is also a freeloader on the disc, so that you can play imported games with or without codes. **Be aware that when saving imported game data, your memory card will be re-formatted to that region, and you will lose all of your save data currently on your memory card! Be sure to have an extra one and label it!**  If you're looking for a simple Gamecube cheat code device, this is really the only one available right now, and last I checked it IS compatible with my Wii, and I do play online with it. But BE FOREWARNED that you won't be able to do all of the cool stuff you see on YouTube. Hopefully one day CodeJunkies will turn their brains back on and start re-producing the AR Max again, but until then we can only hope and wait.	-1
I'm going to make some things perfectly clear about the GCN Action Replay. 1. If you own the Original GCN version(2002-2003) Disc & 64mb memory card. Yes, you can add new codes & save them on the memory card. This version is available on Amazon, the prices are pretty high because they're hard to find. WORKS ONLY WITH GAMECUBE!  2. If you own the newer version, (2007 or newer) this disc will work on a WII. It comes with the disc only, you cannot input your own codes. This version will work with GAMECUBE or WII Consoles. I recently bought the newer version, it does work on my WII console. One of the reasons I bought this version is that there's a code that will unlock all the rare NES games on the Gamecube game ANIMAL CROSSING-ZELDA, MARIO BROS, DK1, DK2, and others. So there you have it, some people need to read the descriptions carefully before jumping to conclusions.	1
Really wish I could enter in my own codes though, so be forewarned you get what you get... not necessarily what you pay for (wasn't cheap imo.) But at least I can play region locked games for my hobby of speedrunning, sometimes playing games casually gets old and certain gamers just want to go fast. :)	1
Used to have one, but it broke on me. I wanted to get this action replay again for relive old times.	1
it's ok i do not like that you can't add new cheats to it but it's pre loaded with alot of games but keep in mind due to the latest system update this no longer works on wii at least for me it did not	1
This game is a waste of the WWE license.  While it could've been a good game, Anchor decided to use the license to sell an unfinished game. This game is just bad, plain and simple.  I don't want to list every bad detail because it'll just hurt my brain to write it out.  I'll just give you some big failures: awful story mode, flawed gameplay, very lousy game music, slow-moving wrestlers, and extremely stupid computer opponents.  There's a way more list of bad things to be listed. The only good thing about this game is its graphics.  They're nice.  That's it.  Nice, but no where near as good as Smackdown Here Comes the Pain's graphics. It's no surprise that this game dropped to 30 bucks in a few short weeks.  I'll let you know this: the price drop DOES have a meaning: this game is awful.	-1
Raw 2 looks wonderful, but it plays like dog poo.  Those giving this title 4 stars and over must not have played the THQ N64 WWE games, or are simply giving this game high stats for the characters and SOME decent models.  This game is loaded with horrible glitches.  It's almost hard to believe that THQ allowed this sloppy, choppy game out the door!  When the computer has a player down, they'll repeatedly proceed to do a routine number of stomps and pins (the player's character is left stunned for a few moments after being pinned, so they're basically left lifeless to the computer).  Also, on tag matches, when the player has an opponent pinned, their partner will often at times leap into the ring and stomp the opponent down on the mat pinned, breaking up the pinfall.  Seasonal mode was a good idea, but was executed very poorly.  The player is given choices to make during matches, but very few of them are carried out (with the exception of resting during matches) and end up  unsuccessful.  With no dialogue or voice-overs (with the exception of the chanting from the crowd and the ref's) the game just doesn't make the player feel like they're in total control of the action.  I often at times spotted my enemies intefering in my matches only to later find them helping me along to win the match.  Also, when the referee's count for the pin, they take an eternity.  Creating character's is pretty fun (there are some wonderful outfits, and designing arena lighting for character's is a blast along with custom soundtracks for theme songs) the player can create a ton. As of to date, Raw 2 may very well be the best wrestling game on xbox, however that's not saying much.  The game feels very rushed and when all is said and done, Raw 2 is simply a disappointing game that had high hopes.  Best if settled for a rental.  However, if desperate to own a WWE game on your xbox, it's probalby best to own a used copy of this game or wait impatiently for a better installment to arrive in the future on the xbox.  The game's just not worth fifty bucks.	-1

This product met my expectations and more. It was in great condition and worked perfectly for what I needed it to	1
This was a great buy for me since i enjoy playing Harvest Moon MM. Full of a variety of codes, but the only thing that i did not like was the fact that you can`t add new codes to it. However, i still love it.	1
They say this is a great purchase. Has helped them with all kinds of games.  It came within two weeks.  Package great and no damage.	1
If you have Gamecube games, and they make you angry, what better way to even the score than by having this "nice" toy with you.^_^	1
Action Replay, one of the most diverse cheat systems available, sure you have Game Genie to help you with some of those pesky "Special" levels in Mario World and Game Shark on the PlayStation. But one cheat system works with all around next gen gaming systems and that is Action Replay. Straight to the point let's start with the gimmick of an Action Replay: this handy little thing is able to allow you to get through the toughest things in games, with codes ranging from infinite time/money/ammo/health to unlocking bonus characters. However this bad boy seems to lack something that the PlayStation AR's do have, imputing newer cheats and games to it. I have seen one star reviews for things that have an unreasonable argument and they are all the same but never in my life I have seen the same thing but repeated quite literally and nearly 30 times with both versions of the GameCube AR (one is the original and the other an updated version that is "compatible" with the Wii.) and that is not being able to put in cheat codes let alone new games into the system. I agree that is a bit lame but not to a degree that it should be as bad as Sonic 2006 and Superman 64 combined. I have very little GameCube games compared to my PlayStation collection and to be fair out of the tiny amount of these GC games I have only two did not appear on the disc itself. Codejunkies.com have code info for this one but what's the point if you can't do a damn thing about it? I will deduct .5 score for that which is the lowest I can go, moving on there is one other thing that I did not like about this an like the "No Add New Codes" crap that I've been hearing about is collection games. I know I'm going against what everybody else did to try and prove that this thing sucks but this is a decent reason to do so, comparing it to the PS2 AR and this one, collection games like the MegaMan X Collection, the PS2 AR has all those separate games combined allowing you to any game in the collection with all of those codes. However the GC AR does not do that, if you want to mess around on say MegaMan X1 and if you got tired of playing that and want to try messing with MegaMan X2 then you need to repeat the process over by switching the discs, find MegaMan X2, etc. I just found this style of using AR cheats on a GC game compared to PS2 AR cheats to be repetitive so like the No Codes ordeal I'll only deduct .5 stars for that. So with that said I give this product a 9/10, sure you can't input new cheats and games to it and the repetitiveness of the whole collection game switch-a-roo thing this is a great product and, if you want as much help with games as possible like I do, I recommend buying this. The only disappointing thing there is about it is that if it has it, it has it, if it doesn't, it doesn't or in other words "What you see is what you get."	1
Excellent item! This is really an amazing item that anybody could buy for their very own personal time and pleasure.	1
This action replay has a nice interface and the cheats work well. I used this for my older games and it worked pretty well. I have had no problems and I really like this device.	1
This is not a step forward from the last Raw game, instead it's a big step sideways. Raw 2 is like the game makers perfected the original Raw game (it only took them 2 years). First off this is a wrestling game, the player may select from one of over sixty WWE "superstars" to compete in a match. During this match the player may use different strikes by pressing the directional pad and the X button and may grapple his opponent by pressing the A button. When performing a grapple, the player can do a weak maneuver by pressing X and the directional pad or a strong maneuver by pressing A and the directional pad. Each WWE "superstar" in the game has their own moves, taunts, strikes, grapple maneuvers, high risk maneuvers and even ways to get in and out of the ring. Unfortunately there are not many submissions in the game, so everyone has the same half Boston crab submission. The game uses a new "spirit" meter that tracks how well the wrestler is doing, when the spirit meter is green, they are doing fine, when it is red, they are ready to do a finishing maneuver, and when it blinks danger, that person is ready to be finished. The wrestlers are big, bold, and life-like chiseled versions of themselves in the game. Even with the great graphics of the game, six wrestlers are allowed to compete at once, and even a referee is in the ring! The matches players can compete in are Normal Singles Matches, Tag, Triple Threat, Fatal 4 Way, Battle Royal, King of the Ring Tournaments, Cage, Hall in a Cell, and Tables, "Ladders and Chairs" (TLC). Despite the game allowing six people in the ring at once there are no six-man tag team matches, however there are Hall in a Cell Matches that allow six people and a referee in them. There are four different referees who count at different speeds, it can be extremely difficult sometimes, because the referees can count so slow you can never get a pinfall! There are fourteen arenas to compete in, Raw, Smackdown and all twelve of the Pay-Per-View Arenas (unlike the original Raw game that just had one arena). Now for the big part of the game, the modes, there are so many modes in this game! You have a quick play mode, for people that just want to throw a match together, an exhibition mode, so you can make your own match to play in, a season mode, which is an ongoing story where you compete show after show in matches, a King of the Ring mode, where you set up a bracket style tournament, a "tournament" mode, where you set up a bracket style tournament, but you can also make the match types yourself. a Royal Rumble mode, where its your wrestler against up to 64 other wrestlers that come to the ring; the object is to throw everyone else over the top rope. There are also design modes like "create a superstar" where you create your own wrestler and save up to 64 of them! "Create a tag team" that allows players to create either a two man or three man tag teams and create their entrances and a movie mode so you can see all the WWE superstar's entrance videos you have enabled. Now that you know all the modes, here are some in depth things about the Season mode and "create a superstar" mode. With the season mode, a month for the season consists of only one Raw, only one Smackdown, then that month's pay per view! The season mode works on a popularity system, lets say you play as Brock Lesnar, he is popular, Rico is not. So what does this popularity do? There are titles, the WWE championship, the "World" championship, Women's, Cruiserweight, Smackdown Tag, and Raw Tag. The popularity of the title-holder of the belt determines who can compete for that belt. World champion Triple would not let Spike Dudley compete for the belt, but he would let a popular superstar like Shawn Michaels go for the belt. So how do you get more popular? For each match of a TV show, you can do something to get more popular, you can win your match, interfere in someone else's match, sneak attack a wrestler, set a trap for a wrestler, call out a wrestler, manipulate a wrestler to attack your enemy, encourage an ally, find a manager, steal something (this is how you enable outfits and entrance videos), or break up with a tag partner. Everything you do can either get you more popular or less popular, and there is a chance you could fail doing these things. Everything you do will cost you spirit for your match on that show, so you could go into your match in "danger." You can also build alliances and enemies in the season mode. Create a superstar is extremely detailed, everything from their in ring attire, their out of ring attire, their name, alliances, attributes, and "character" to their wrestling moves, and an extremely detailed entrance where you can pick their lighting, pyrotechnics (you can even time the pyrotechnics!), their entrance video (you can even make their entrance video with the created superstar), you can also use music on your X-Box for your superstar's entrance theme! Finally, there are over 60 wrestlers in the game, and here is a list: Austin, Goldberg, Batista, Big Show, Billy Gunn, Kidman, Booker T, Bradshaw, Lesnar, Bubba Ray, Chavo Guerrero, Val Venis, Benoit, Jericho, Christian, Chris Nowinski, Chuck Palumbo, Crash, D-Von, Eddie Guerrero, Edge, Goldust, Hardcore Holly, Hogan, Hurricane, Jacqueline, Jamie Noble, Jazz, John Cena, Kane, Kevin Nash, Kurt Angle, Lance Storm, Lita, Mark Henry, Matt Hardy, Molly, Nidia, Orton, Mysterio, Rhyno, Flair, Rico, Rikishi, Rob Van Damn, Scott Steiner, Shannon Moore, Shawn Michaels, Spike, Stacey Keibler, Stephanie McMahon, Steven Richards, Tajiri, Terri, Test, The Rock, Undertaker, Dreamer, Torrie, HHH, Trish, Victoria, and William Regal.	1
ok im gonna keep this simple this game is a waste of money .	-1
I haven't played it yet cause I'm sill waiting it for it to be delivered... (I said one to 3 days, they say 7...ugh....) But from what I hear, it great the only thing wrong with it is that you cant put in your own cheat, or new cheats for newer games... I'm really excited to get it cause i hate playing by the rules when it come to video games. After I buy this one, Im thinking of buying the one for the PS2...what can I say im sucker for chaeting....	1
I don't even have this product, but I have SD Media Launcher for NGC and I know that the disc is a relabeled AR disc, but it actually comes w/ an adapter and has some homebrew support unlike the new AR (a list of AR codes appear on a background w/ the "Action Replay" logo using SD Media Launcher, if an SD card isn't inserted).  If you're getting this new product for cheats go ahead (you can cheat on homebrew and/or the AR disc included w/ SD Media Launcher anyway... it makes this product less than pointless...), but keep in mind that only SD media launcher can boot homebrew (like dol files, some used for legal back-ups, and even bootable dol files for earlier versions of AR which aren't avaliable/discontinued!!) unlike this. I have SDLOAD, GCoS 1.5, AR 1.08, etc all in DOL files (homebrew) and it's all thanks to SD Media Launcher, so either get SD Media Launcher and/or AR 1.08 (real disc, however, it's discontinued..) + SD Gecko for booting homebrew on your NGC console!	-1
the action replay does work on the wii but its only for gamecube games. sometimes the wii resets its self because of the disk but nothing bad. this does not damage gamecubes or wiis. the ar is preloaded with all available codes. I love this thing i was able to beat loz twlight princess and other games with it. its easy to use also.ignore the bad comments they didn't read the package right.	1
Raw 2 for the Xbox is the greatest wrestling game I have ever played. It is a major improvment over last years game, the graphics and gameplay are excellent and the entrances are awesome every one is exactly how it should be and the sound is great. With over 60 wrestlers and a story mode that never gets old you can't go wrong with this game. The only drawback is that there is no elimination chamber match. We will have to wait until Smackdown: Here Comes the Pain is released for that, but don't let that keep you from buying a great game.	1
If there's ever been an argument for the unification of THQ's WWE games across platforms, Raw 2 would probably seal the deal. The game's not terrible-its Season mode gives you more control over the evolving storyline than any other WWE game before-but actually playing the game feels like the industry has devolved to the days when games could be exciting just for being wrestling games. Aside from its nice but dull looks and the neat customization options in the Create A Superstar mode, Raw 2 is a step backward in wrestling game quality. For Xbox-owning WWE fans, Raw 2 has tons of superstars and match types, and WWE fans are known for being forgiving of poor gameplay if these other aspects are around. The four-player Season mode lacks polish and could use a few more months of work, but if you're looking for a WWE experience with your friends, you could do worse than Raw 2. The biggest problem with the Season mode is that you can't skip your own matches; the options to stage surprise attacks on rivals, encourage friendly wrestlers to do well, and call out opponents for matches make for intriguing behind-the-scenes mindgames that would have flourished in a game with a competent fighting system. In fact, the Season mode is pretty much the only thing keeping this lump of disappointment afloat. There are much better wrestling games out there than this, and the WWE shows are on several times each week if you need to get your manly soap-opera fix.	1
I have to give this a one star rating in hopes that people will read this.  I have a wii system and although this is advertised wii compatible, IT IS NOT WII COMPATIBLE.  You might be okay if you have one of the first wiis that were produced and have never taken it online and have not played any new wii game.  The updates for the system make it so you cannot use any cheat devices.  It won't even work for playing gamecube games.  If you want to cheat on a gamecube game, use a gamecube.	-1
This item was extremely hard to find but it was the only gift he wanted so I am glad i found it here on Amazon.	1
To be perfectly honest, I don't own the Action Replay, though I would like to. I am only reviewing to let the uninformed buyer know that they should ignore the two people who gave the Action Replay a bad review. This 'christina swan' person I can forgive, as she apparently doesn't know much about game systems. I'll tell you now, a cheat system CAN NOT ruin the game system itself. I own a gameshark for the N64, and I know that the dumbest thing you can do with one of those is to put in a bunch of random characters and hope it's a good code, and even then, the worst you could do was ruin the gameshark itself. If you want my opinion, the kid probably left the Gamecube open too long, letting dust or something get on the laser reader, blocking the laser and rendering the Gamecube unable to read discs. That happened to me before, the guy who did the repairs said that happened a lot with laser-disk based game systems like Gamecube and PS2. As for the I HATE ACTION REPLAY guy, I'm gonna have to come up with a list for you: -The codes are a bunch of numbers and letters, it takes you over two hours to put in one code. *These codes are meant to actually change how the Gamecube reads the game, so you can keep the health meter stuck on full and stuff like that. Can you appreciate how much programming code is used to pull off something like that? Feel lucky you only have to put in a few letters and numbers. And as for the two hours, can you say exaggeration!?! I really doubt it would take even the slowest gamer that long to put in codes. Besides, learn to put a little effort into what you do. -Codes only give you stuff like infinite lives and extra characters, who in their right mind would want that junk on their game? *Oh, for the love of... It's a CHEAT SYSTEM. You're supposed to *gasp* CHEAT WITH IT!! Who in their right mind would want that on their game, you ask? Everyone but you, apparently. -The price is too much.... it should be less. *It's worth how much it cost the company to make it, plus some for profit. If you don't like it, don't whine to everyone on Amazon about it. -Also it doesn't work on my super nintendo. *Oh my...I'm sorry, I didn't know you had mental problems. You see, kid, a system that's made for a Gamecube usually works on a Gamecube, not the Super Nintendo. They're completely different systems, you see. -Datel can't make cheat systems, they should jump off a bridge. *I hate to stoop to your level, but here goes: Considering your arguments, I think the world would be done a much better favor if YOU were to jump off a bridge. A high one. That happens to be over a pile of jagged rocks. Actully, that felt pretty good. Anyway, last one: -Don't buy this...instead go by the amazing Etch-A-Sketch. *Why? If a person is looking for a cheat system, how would a toy drawing pad help them? And, no offence to you Etch-A-Sketch fans, but I don't see what's so amazing about it. Please come up with a decent argument next time. If anyone wants to argue about this some more, feel free to e-mail or something, especially if you happen to be anything like this I HATE ACTION REPLAY guy. I'm here 'til Thursday. ;-)	1
Here's my two cents worth of this. Is this the best wrestling game out there. To me, no. Does it have merit, and is it worth playing and owning? Yes.   The presentation overall is quite good. Graphically and soundwise I like this a lot. It's well done. The conrols, to me, were easy enough to learn with reading the manual and a bit of practice. Every move resounds with the sound of impact when you land a punch or a kick or a move of any type at all really, and particualarly when attacking with weapons. I like the fact that when the tables break, the peices STAY in the ring and can also be used to hit your opponent. The only thing is that with six tables in the ring, along with a couple of chairs and what have you, you have a mess. It can be real carnage in the ring sometimes.   There is no commentary in this game. This is not a bad thing. The only thing is that after the last two Smackdown games, I miss the commentary. You may not, but that's up to you. The story more is kind of fun, but at the same time, it's limited in it's scope. Before every show,  there are eight to ten matches, and you can decide what you want your wrestler to do before each one. You can rest, call someone out, attack them, set traps, complain, and a few other things I can't remember right now. The action you choose will be accompanied by a short cutscene of your wrestler doing what you chose. However, there is no text to explain things in Season Mode like the Smackdown games have. You have to watch characters body language to figure out what exactly is going on in this season mode. The only voice-work is done by Lillian Garcia and Howard Finkle, the ring announcers.   This brings me to the real strength of the game: the Create a Superstar Mode. You can customize your height, weight, and call name, all the way to the lighting, pyros, and music for your entrance. This really helps you customize your wrestler and feel like you are wrestling as yourself. Coming out to your own music and having your home state announced really makes you feel like you are part of the WWE action. On the other side of the coin, the season mode only lasts until you get to Wrestlemania, and as far as I can tell, goes no further. You don't get to play AS the Champion after you win the title, as far as I can see. I beat Hulk Hogan at Wrestlmania and after a brief celebration screen, it went to the  closing credits of the game. At least in Smackdown I could play more and defend my belt and such. In closing, this is a good fun game. I gave it four stars instead of five because I miss things. I miss commentary, and I like a scripted story to an extent. Will I get Smackdown Here Comes The Pain? I hope to. Is Raw 2 worth owning? To me, yes it is. Both it and Smackdown Here Comes The Pain are and will be good titles with their own strengths and merits. If you pick this up, I wish you much fun with it, because as a fun wrestling game that lets you have your own personality, this does shine. Peace to all who may read this. God bless you all.	1
Action Replay has tons of great cheats you can activate. But in a short time it can break down. Trust me make sure you have a reciet.	1
Bought this product on 11/18/04 from Walmart and for the first week it worked great.  It had over a hundred games preloaded in, and I was able to add new codes to the game.  Unfortunately I assumed too much, and assumed that it would work flawless, so I threw away my receipt and the box and only kept the manual and game.  However just today I loaded this unit, and all my codes were ERASED!!  I did not do anything, the machine just erased all my codes!  What a piece of junk!	-1
A nice game. Better than Shark Tales. Cute movie scenes between challenges. My 4yr old grandson enjoys it. Good family fare :-)	1
We bought this for our 5 year old son, the whiz of the Xbox. He's beat many many games - even more so than his dad or I. But this one was one of those games that none of us in the family could get past. There's something about how you move or swim that just wasn't set up right to where you knew where you were going. We very rarely ever get this game out - except to dust.	-1
This game had a lot of great features.  The graphics were a A+, very good graphics, it includes movie clips from Finding Nemo, the voices all sound the same as the movie and its a fun game to play....UNTIL.....it gets so hard that adults can't even get past it, then it gets frustrating!  We purchased this game even after reading other reviews and to our expectations, we were happy with the game, until we got to the dreaded part that we can not get past!  Our son loves to play the game, but its too hard for him to actually play, he just lets Nemo swim around until a clam clamps his tail or a puffer fish hits against him.  We have to play all the rest of the game.  Its fun, and would be great to rent, but I don't know about buying it.  I am going to check the websites to see if there is cheat codes for the game- this would be the only way to get past this game!  Why they made this game so hard is questionable to us?  RENT IT- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING IT!	1
I just recently bought the Game Boy Player by Nintendo for my Gamecube, and yet, I still had yet to buy a code enhancer for the system. Still, there were just so many of them, they all seemed to surprise me very well. Arguably, when game enhancers are released, they always seem to get you in the wallet, if one doesn't fit right. You always need to get a video game code enhancer to play and win the game, every time you get a new video game system. Still, I was torn between 2 of them, Gameshark, and Action Replay. The Action Replay for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, SP version, and the Game Boy Player for the Nintendo Gamecube, really fits very well for players alike. Unlike other code enhancers, you don't need to constantly update this one by buying another updated version of the Action Replay. The codes work very well with so many different games like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3, Pac-Man collection, and others to boot. You can always either download them from their website, codejunkies.com, or you can manually install codes using the video game magazines that publish those codes, like Electronic Games Monthly, or get their published books of all different codes in updated books that are sold in the stores. Although it is very tough to tell which one to choose from for the Game Boy Advance, Gameshark or Action Replay. I strongly suggest you get the Action Replay, because it is a little bit cheaper than the Gameshark. It is well worth the tweaking, to beat the games you take for the ride.	1
It appears that a lot of new games coming out based on movies are actually getting better and better (a good example is LOTR:The Two Towers), but unfortunately, Nemo is not one of them. As other reviewers have mentioned, the loading times are utterly unacceptable - loading take so long it ruins the flow and story that the game is trying to tell us (Nemo and his dad trying to find their way to school). And the gameplay itself is horrible and unintuative. Trying to navigate a little clown fish through the depths of the sea is an effort in total luck and frustration - if you want Nemo to swim up, you must push down on the control stick, if you want Nemo to swim down, you must push up. This control scheme may be alright for flight simulator games, but in a game that kids that will be playing is alien, confusing, and bass-ackwards. The only saving grace for this game is the graphics. They are indeed good. And it is neat to see and hear all the characters from the movie. But these cutscenes and voices from the movie are the only things that will hold a kids interest, because the game itself is deeply flawed. Caveat emptor!	-1
Okay, you are not going to get the same game as on the Xbox, PS2, or Game Cube, but in and of itself, this is a great GBA game. And there ARE stealth aspects to the game, but game play is much simpler than on the consoles. Graphics are super detailed.	1
The original Splinter Cell on the Xbox simply blew me away with its awe-inspiring graphics and gameplay.  The GBA version is a bland 2D side scroller that doesn't even come close to 1/10th of the fun of the Xbox version.  The graphics has some kind of industrial overtone that just looks awful, and Sam Fisher's missions just look ridiculous in a 2D environment, because the stealth factor just isn't there.  The GBA version is also quite short, so if you absolutely have to play the game, rent it.	-1
This is a one of the few games that can be made for xbox, gamecube, PS2, and PC, and is still awesome on GBA! The grapics aren't as good, but I really can't blame Ubi for that. On all of the other versions of Splinter Cell, the graphics are 3-D. This game would be hard to play with 3-D graphics for GBA. The missions are slightly different from what I have been told. If you are a person who gats a game and expects to be good at it the first time you play it, this is NOT the game for you! Splinter Cell takes alot of time to learn. The entire game is about being able to be stealthy. You don't want to use up all of your amunition. That is why there are dark spots you can hide in to jump out and use your fighting skills to knock your enemy out. Pros 1. Same basic objective to the game. 2. Lots of fun to sneek around and knock out people. 3. Lots of cool moves that you can use on Sam Fisher. Cons 1. Can't get all of the old weapons 2. Very difficult! 3. Frustrating to have to play the missions all over again if you lose! The A.I. in this game is pretty good. The problem with it is, your enemy can react to you to fast for you do do something. If you are move to fast you get detected, if you move to slow you get detected. One of the most frustrating things of this game is the fact that if you get deteced, the enemy will, A. Shoot, or Stun you. B. Will flip the alams and you you have about 6 sec. to find the switch before the mission is over. All in all, I found this game to be challenging but rewarding if you win.	1
If you've played Splinter Cell on the PC or any of the home systems, than you allready know what a fantastic game it is.  When it was announced that Splinter Cell would be ported to the GBA, a few eyebrows were raised questioning how much of the game's substance can be crammed into a little 32-bit cartridge.  Well, Ubi Soft did a better than expected job with porting Splinter Cell to the GBA, and while it may look like an average side scroller to the naked eye, there is more here than one might think.  First off the graphics are nicely done, and everyone's favorite secret agent commando Sam Fisher is fluidly animated for the most part.  The gameplay tries to incorporate aspects from it's bigger console bretheren such as using stealth to your advantage, while mixing it with basic 2-D platform elements.  Splinter Cell for the GBA is nicely paced and action packed from beginning to end, but the game is rather short in length and really doesn't offer anything else.  All that aside, Splinter Cell is a much better than expected game for the GBA that attempts to carry the spirit of the original game, and while it has it's flaws, it surprisingly holds together well.	1
both my boys ages 4 and 9 luv it . . . . . . . . .. . .	1
this is suck a sweet movies teaches lessons and it is great for the whole family everyone can get into it	1
This game is awesome. I bought it about a week ago, despite the reviews. Well, the reviews were WRONG. The loading time is, if any, 5 seconds. It can be a bit difficult at times, too. Oh, plus, it is mainly a game, NOT the movie, as a few people had said. It's more playing the game than watching the clips from the movie. If you are a fan of Nemo, or underwater games, buy this.	1
After watching the beautiful movie, I had no doubt on clicking and buying this game, yet without checking opinions about it. So let's imagine THQ staff chating at the office, the guys with feet over the table, and the director tells: come on, we have to deliver this game until next weekend! And they just had the work of copying movie scenes and making a no concept, with terrible gameplay title. Last, and most important argument of all to hold you far from this game: the bigest challenge is to exercise your pacience with the HUGE loading time. It takes about 4 minutes (an eternity if you look at an ugly clownfish swinging at screen) to load a new level. You don't have clear goals to achieve, you feel like beeing pushed to the end of each stage. People of Pixar and Disney must be ashamed. It takes an unbeliavable distance beetwen the movie and the game. If you are not training your patience to be next Dalai Lama, trust this cheated player.	1
This game suffers from the same flaws that Indiana Jones for the Xbox suffers, no in level saves.  So if you die at the end, you start all over at the start of the level.  Also, Mr. Fleenor, if you pull in your claws, Woverine heals at a rapid rate. But as a whole, rent, do not buy this.  It is worth a look but not worth [$$$]	1
X2 Wolverine's Revenge (made by: Activision) is going to be a AWESOME game to play on the XBOX game system I give it 5 Stars "Highly Recommended" REALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO BUY AND PLAY this game on the XBOX game system	1
THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! By the Way im the son of this User 15 years old so...I Created the Account. Anyway THIS GAME IS AWESOME you get to use WOLVERINE'S Brute Strength to Kick Villian's Butts like Magneto , Sabertooth Ect. I AM A DIE HARD Wolverine Fan and this game when i play it its for me like liveing the DREAM!. Pay no Attention to these Negative Reviews when i play it on XBOX NO GLITCHES NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE DANG GAME!!!! you get to use AWESOME Combos its like this.  Get up Behind a guy Jump on his back and Stab him through the Neck. PRICELESS! DO NOT HESITATE BUY IT NOW YOU FREAK!!!!  By the Way the Daniel in this name is my First name	1
This game is like the worst game ever made. I'm a really huge fan of stealth games, and other games that have a similar feel to this one. However, this game did horrible.   This is the sort of game where they tell you it all depends on stealth, but in the end, you can tell that: level "A" requires stealth tactics to reach a goal, but level "B" requires outright mayhem. Often if you make a small mistake, you're practically dead. Sure you regenerate some health, but it is painstakingly slow, and in at least one level you have to do without.   The stealth is also very clunky. You enter a sort of cutscene when you implement the move, and whereas this looks cool, the lack of control and longevity more often than not cause you to be seen by his buddy.   The actual "outright mayhem" part of the game is EXTREMELY poor. Though they try to implement a system of "special moves", the timing is hard to master and the chances to use them so few and far between that you often forgot the buttons you need to push (i.e. the controls are pretty crappy). Not to mention the lack of a tutorial really hurt the game, as it took me like 20 minutes to get out of the first room (I died twice before i figured out how to kill the first goons, and then it took another 10 minutes to figure out how to open the door).   Everything in the game is a bit choppy--but that doesn't mean that it isn't addictive. The game actually somehow still comes across as fun. I think you could actually overlook most of the faults, if you had the ability to save anywhere. Doing the same level over and over isn't my idea of a good game.   My recommendation is to rent it--don't buy it, not for any price above a rental price anyway.	-1
This game rocks. You will never find a better fighting/adventure game anywhere. The graphics are perfect, the controls are awesome and the story is cool. I've never had this much fun playing a super-hero game. I could play this game and beat it a million times and it would still be just as fun. They have finally made a Wolverine game that is true to the character. You really feel like you are Wolverine when you play this game. You can use his senses to pull of some bad-a$$ moves and you have truly devastating wicked combos that you can give your hated foes. The game is fun to play and the extras make it even better. You can find alternate Wolverine costumes throughout the game. You can also find really cool info cards that feature all of Wolverine's friends and foes. You can even (this is the best extra) have your own custom soundtrack in the game. This makes the game so much better than any other fighting/adventure game because you can put in some tunes that really rock and fit well with Wolverine's battles. Wolverine's Revenge is one of the best games on the X-Box. I would even say that it is one of the best games that I have ever played. If you love good fighting games and Wolverine you will love this game.	1
X2 Wolverine's Revenge os a wolverines solo adventure where you get to play the ultimate living weapon and world's toughest x-Men member. As the adventure unfolds, you have many choices to make. What tactics will you employ to succeed-Stealth or all-out action? where will use your heightened senses to find clues about how to progress? How will you overcome the tremendous odds facing you in your quest? How best to manage your accelerated healing factor and Feral rages? The choices are all yours to make, WOLVERINE!! now this Game is cool for Wolverine's Fans or X-Men Fans it is better than Spiderman and one of the best activision Games, but some levels in the game gets harder. In The Game: *Unsheathe your your razor-Sharp claws, unleash lethal combo attacks and use accelerated healing powers as you tear into intense action and stealth scenarios. *Enter the realm of senses, Using your heightened mutant senses to see scent particles and detect heat when tracking enemies. *face off with Sabertooth, Wendigo, Juggernaut and Magneto, while Proffessor X and Beast Help you search for a cure. well i still havn't finished the game and i'm Sure you will Have Fun Playing This Game.	1
I've noticed something about all the solo wolverine games I've played. All of them have something to do with the Weapon X project. This one, though, is the best. It starts out at the Weapon X base in 1968, and shows Wolverine escaping. Fast-foreward 30 years. The Shiva virus, lieing dormant until now, has infected him and Logan has 48 hours to find the cure. The implementation of this game is great. The Customizable soundtrack option is(ofcourse) and XBox exclusive, is golden. The implementation of steath, the healing factor, and the multiple costumes is perfection. And the character voices. Mark Hamill does a wonderful job as wolverine, much better than Hugh Jackman. And who better than Patrick Stewart to do Xavier. The dialoge is true to the characters(the line "Security is tighter than one of Jean's outfits" fits so well), all because Larry Hama, former writer of the Wolverine comic, wrote the story. My only complaint is the fact that if this game is comic based (look at logan's conversation with magneto late in the game), why is Colossus there? He's supposed to be dead. All in all, If you want to BE the best there is at what he does, this is deffinately worth your money.	1
Sonic and his buddies should always be presented in 2D, and SA2 is by far the best evidence I have to back up my case. This game is a pocket adrenaline rush, featuring designed worlds strung together by ramps, swings, and loop-de-loops. The game provides a sense of speed I haven't experienced since Sonic 2 rolled around for Sega Genesis 10 yrs ago. And now that I'm thinkin about it, I'd say this new release is actually a touch better than that milestone classic. Bold words,I know, but give this game a chance and you'll understand where I'm coming from. SA2 is instantly accessible, and it stands as the perfect compliment to the more methodical Mario games already in your collection. This game isn't about depth, it's about it's all about flash and energy, and I mean that in a good way. The game does have one big flaw:it's length. Experienced Sonicheads will blow through this short adventure in less than 3hrs. After you finish the game with Sonic, you can play through as one of his buds, but really it's the same game regardless of wh you are playing as. Even so, SA2 is definitely worth adding to your collection.	1
Sonic advance 2 i've never played yet but this should be a lot of fun. after reading the other reviews i had to buy it. plus one of my favorite Sonic characters first appearnce too. Cream the rabbit.  Cream can fly but not as far as Tails can. in fact she flies a little shorter then Tails. i don't know the ins and outs of the game yet but i still can't believe i haven't got this one in the three game series so the next one after this is obviously Sonic advance three. i recomend this to anyone who is a Sonic fan	1
Great Sonic game.	1
It works. No complaints.	1
Trilogy complete! this is my favorite one!	1
Great game except for the special stages. The we're so bad. Rest Of the game was awesome though.	1
I thought that this one was the most challenging of the Sonic Advance series. Plus there was a little more to this game than just winning and collecting the emeralds. Another thing that is slightly different in this one is that you start with just Sonic and unlock most of the other characters as you play through with him. I liked it though. Any Sonic fan I believe would be pleased with this one.	1
works fine  good buy	1
A+	1
Very fun game, like the classic sonic games.	1
great game	1
My son is very happy with it!	1
It was 2001. SEGA's console department fell apart. The Dreamcast was pretty awesome, but when it came down to the Nintendo 64, Playstation 1 & 2, and the Xbox all together, it seems like SEGA couldn't keep up with them, as the company began to turn into a third-party developer/publisher. So what do they do? THEY MAKE A SONIC GAME ON THE NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE (With publishing help from THQ)! How cool is that?! Sonic has arrived onto a Nintendo system! Sure, Sonic Adventure 2 on the Gamecube may have technically been his Nintendo debut for us, but Sonic Advance was a whole new game. And even better: It was 2D Sonic fun. Fast forward a year or two later, we get another offering of said 2D Sonic fun.  Sonic Advance 2 is a more speed-orientated game compared to its predecessor. Most of the time, you'll be running through levels in an incredible pace. It's like a 2D rollercoaster ride. Nevertheless, it was really satisfying. The level design is HUGE, and is well multilayered. Sonic Advance 1 had multilayered level design as well, but here, it's totally expanded. There are lots of areas to explore if you're not a big fan of this "go to end of the level" thing. In fact, to get to the Special Stages in the game, you gotta find 7 "special rings" scattered in each level. Everyone's gotta love Special Stages, eh? But even without the exploration factor, the levels are still very fun to blast through. I just wish there were a few more enemies in each level.  Of course, the graphics were really detailed, colorful, and vibrant all around. Actually...It seems like they IMPROVED on the graphics department. These new zones look all the more better than they did back in Sonic Advance. Speaking of improvements, the soundtrack managed to be catchier, too. And with level themes such as a Techno Base and a Music Plant, it's obvious we'll be expecting some good music out of here.  The only major flaw with Sonic Advance 2 is that it does sometimes feel like it's not offering as much platforming gameplay as it should have. It's speed, speed, SPEED. At least there's still some platforming, but not as much as its predecessor.  But all in all, Sonic Advance 2 is definitely worth your while, and if you're into this Sonic stuff, then you're in for a good time.	1
Sonic Advance 2 is a pretty good game. It has bigger levels than the first game, more interesting locales, and catchier music. It's pretty fun, and although it's not the best Sonic game ever, it's completely competent. It's a great example of the power of the GBA, with bright, colorful graphics and great sound, as Sonic blasts through the stages at mach speed. It has pretty tight control too, so you don't feel like Sonic/Tails/Knuckles/Cream just careened into a pit because you couldn't control them.  It does have some problems though: Getting into Special Stages is extremely difficult, as you need to find 7 Special Rings to enter them, and the stages are not suited for backtracking to find them. At all. Even from the first stage, you need to map out a specific route to find them all, you can't look for them and still get them all in one run.  Also, all of the bosses except the last main boss are fought on-the-run, as in Sonic is being sent along to try and catch up with the boss, similar to bosses in Sonic Unleashed. The problem with this is that 1: it makes hitting the boss noticeably more difficult, and more importantly 2: sends all your rings flying off screen as you run past them.  Some of the level design is pretty cheap (notably, the entirety of Sky Canyon, and parts of Egg Utopia), but otherwise, not too shabby.  Despite all these issues, it's a fun game, with fun levels, and fun to play as characters, which almost act as difficulty settings (e.g, Sonic is hard mode (no flight/anything), Tails/Knuckles are medium (flight/glide), and Cream is easy mode (flight and can kill bosses with no effort)). And even though I complained about the bosses, they are pretty fun to fight, and being bosses, the two factors add difficulty (unless you're Cream, who can just press the B button near a boss/enemy and have her Chao auto-attack it).  So, all in all, it's a good game. Flawed, but good.	1
Sonic is not all about the speed. I wish the developers of Sonic Advance 2 had understood that. The Sonic games for the Megadrive/Genesis were all platformers that relied as much on exploration and tactic as speed. There were hidden treasures to be found to reward you for exploring the well-designed levels, as well as considerable challenges facing you on your way. SA2 feels more like a roller coaster ride; a fun one, but ultimately that's it.  The basic level in this game is thus. You start with a countdown to 'GO!', at which point you take off at lightning speed unless you try to stop. It's impossible to explore. Even if you try to take but a few steps to explore for hidden treasures, you usually wind up triggering a hidden springboard that propels you down the nearest slide, thus far out of reach of your previous area. How are you supposed to find anything in a game constructed like that? The levels are designed with speed in mind, not gameplay. I have turned the time limit off just so I could explore the very first level for a port to the Special Stage. And after almost an hour of searching, I'd finally had enough. That was just the first stage, too; imagine how hard the other ones must be to find!  This game is all about the speed. It's quite obvious. The faster you go, the bigger a bonus you get at the end of a level. All boss fights take place while Sonic is running, and I admit that that is where the speed is an innovative feature, building on the first Robotnik boss battle in Sonic & Knuckles. For every other Robotnik fight, you rescue one of your three companions; Cream the rabbit, Tails and Knuckles the echidna (whose character is completely negated by having him been duped by Robotnik again). The short cinema screens after each of these battles are a welcome touch.  In fact, where Sonic Advance 2 shines is in its style. There are a lot of interesting courses; my favourite is an ice world with a city in the background, set during the night. There is also a fascinating hi-tech zone and of course Robotnik's Death Egg, whose battle is the toughest before getting to the final boss. The music is quite good but not inspiring or memorable enough to compete with other Sonic soundtracks. The final boss battle consists of all of Robotnik's battles in one go, plus a very final master robot battle which, in a completely contradicting fashion, brings you to a full stop. It's ironic that the game's final boss should finally wipe the grease off your shoes, but therein lies the challenge; suddenly you must revive your precision instincts from the Sonic classics. You might say it's too little, too late, though.  These are the game's best points. Sadly, Sonic Advance 2 doesn't allow you appreciate it to the fullest, because it just hurls you on at too much speed for you to be able to. It's a game ultimately lacking in any depth to be really rewarding to play. Speed is not what made Sonic great, and his games can't sustain themselves solely on that - Sonic Advance 2 is proof enough. The previous title, Sonic Advance, has a far better idea on what made Sonic great.	-1
This is game for GBA, but a fun game to play. Sonic Advance 2 is challenging. The hard core fan will love this game.	1
This is a great game.  First off, comparing it to Sonic Advance, which is a good game in its own right, this game is indeed a big improvement.  You not only get to play as all of the characters you could in Sonic Advance, but there is a cool new character included, or I should say two, Cream the Rabbit and her partner Cheese the chao.  The levels are pretty and various, from the quaint Leaf Forest, to the highly enjoyable Music Plant to the icy loveliness of Ice Paradise.  They have added what is called "after images" which really adds speed and depth when the characters are running, for it gives the illusion of great speed.  There is also this extremely cute feature, that when you hold up on the control pad each character does a unique action.  This won't help you through the gameplay much, but if you are not in a hurry to get out of the level, at least watch it for a minute.  It really is cute.  I also heard Knuckles' action can be use as an attack.  The boss fights are very different from the other games as, except for the last two, you have to attack them while you are running.  This has various advantages and disadvantages, but overall it makes the boss fights fun and enjoyable with a challenging difficulty.  Personally, how Cream can beat most of the bosses is my favorite.  She makes things ridiculously easy, because all you have to do is smack the B button a couple of times, and her partner Cheese takes care of things.  Now, there are indeed some disadvantages with the game.  Here is a list of them:  1.  As I said earlier, the fact you have to tackle most of the bosses while running can have disadvantages.  It is harder to dodge attacks, and if you are struck, it can take some time to recover and catch up.  The good news is you won't die if you fall behind, as the screen will just scoot you along; but if you don't enjoy this sort of combat, than that's a for sure minus.  2.  The special stages are fun.  It's basic, you just have to run around a set area, and try to get enough rings before time runs out while simultaneously avoiding a robot that is pursuing you.  The catch?  Try getting to the special stages.  Unlike other Sonic games where you just jump on a spring, you have to collect all seven of these SPECIAL rings in the act.  Please do not get these confused with normal rings.  Special rings are big rings with what I think are wings in the upper center.  Anyway, how do you get them?  You have to find them.  Easier said than done, because most of the time this is infuriatingly difficult, as it is easy to miss one or two, and be left out of the Special Stage.  I admit I had to have outside help to find all of these annoying rings.  On top of that if you lose the Special stage, simply not getting enough normal rings, you have to collect those Special rings ALL OVER AGAIN!!!  While this normally isn't a probem, the hardest special stages (I am speaking of the last one and the second to last one, in Techno Base and Egg Utopia) are also in the acts with the hardest to get to Special rings, and the hardest to survive levels.  That's the last thing, if you don't make it out of the level on one life alive, you can say "bye bye" to all the rings you managed to collect.  3.  You have to unlock virtually everything.  Unless you can progress in the game all you can play as is Sonic.  You have to play with him and bump into Cream, Tails, and Knuckles in order to play with them.  This game has a tiny chao garden, but you won't receive it untill you complete the game (chaos emeralds included) with one character.  There is also stuff like time attack and sound test that you can unlock by completing the game with more than one character, but this is very difficult, and you will be pretty lucky to get the tiny chao garden.  4.  You have to complete the game with four characters to get to play as Amy Rose.  On top of that, Amy is just an extra, which is a real shame since sega missed out on what could have potentially been a funny cutscene in Sonic's story.  I will say that it is worth it to unlock her if you can, for her moves are new and improved, her new spindash is funny, and her control pad action is cute.  Be warned that if you do decide to try and complete the game with her it is for your sheer enjoyment only.  In other words, you get no rewards for beating the game with her.  5.  There is some repitition.  If you want to unlock absolutely everything, or complete the game completely, you have to beat the game with every character (including Amy, if you want a real 100%).  This means starting with Leaf Forest and going all the way past Egg Utopia and the Final Boss, chaos emeralds in tow and everything at least 5 times.  The one thing I do not understand is how you can rescue, say Knuckles in an area as far as Sky Canyon, and yet when you begin playing as him, you must start all the way back at Leaf Forest.  It's how it is though, and don't ask me how all of the characters manage to get back there. The Special ring locations always stay the same, so you are just going through the absolute same zones and bosses around 5 times (if you choose to go through it all at once), give or take difficulty depending on you character (Creams easier than Sonic for example).  You will also have to beat the extra boss once, which has a nice difficulty level.  At least the levels are, for the most part, enjoyable, so you may not mind going through some of them so many times.  One of my personal favorites is the Music Plant, where you can actually hop on a xylophone (thats pronounced ZYE-luh-fohn, for those who are youngsters).  Also the scenes after the extra boss are also worth seeing if you can conquer it.  6.  The tiny chao garden once again fails to impress as much as one of the big gardens in the Sonic Adventure series.  However, it is still a good place to level up your baby chao, and in this game the chao seem more "Life-like" as they actually use the pool.  The minigames also have a little fun in them, I personally prefer the one where you have to make sure Cheese doesn't fall on the ground while collecting the rings.  You will laugh when he does though, as Cream covers her face with her hands, while Cheese's face says as plain as day "OUCH!"  That about concludes it for me.  The music is so-so, not Sega's best, but still good.  I basically rated the game for four star fun, because of the flaws I have listed, but five stars overall because it is a HUGE improvement from Sonic Advance, which is also fun.  Speaking of fun, if that and those old speedy thrills is what you want, than for pete sakes PURCHASE THIS VIDEOGAME!	1
The Sonic series has translated very nicely to the GBA and this title proves it.  Give it a try.	1
This is the best Sonic game on GBA. Sonic Advance was good,but #3 was very bad. Sonic Advance 2 has a new character named Cream. She is really neat but dosn't have much of an attack. I'd reccomend this game because you alot faster and there's more action in it.	1
While not necessarily raising the bar in my opinion the way "Sonic Battle" did for me, "Sonic Advance 2" is nonetheless another home run for the legendary Sonic video game franchise.   The play pattern is virtually the same as it's classic Sega Genesis ancestors: Dr. Eggman (previously known as Robotnik) is once again causing havoc with his megalomaniac schemes of taking over the entire world by building another 'death egg' (God, everything he builds is named after eggs) spaceship by wielding the power of the legendary chaos emeralds. Even worse is that Sonic's friends have been captured by Eggman and held hostage.   As a result, in the beginning, Sonic is the only available player but as one beats the boss machine at the end of the stages, more characters are unlocked and the game begins to branch into different versions of itself. My favorite is a tie between Tails and Cream.   The problem with this game though is a frustrating part. Although not completely, I've found it almost downright impossible to find all seven special rings in order to access the special stages at the end of each regular stage. (I've managed to get to special stage one after "Leaf Forest" but that's it) The last six regular stages make it like looking for a needle in a haystack.   Otehr than that, this is a very good Sonic Adventure game and is another good addition to the Sonic Legacy. With the frustrating Special Stage requirements, I guess they didn't call it "Sonic Advance" for nothing. :/ :)	1
If you have played the great classic Genesis Sonic games and the first Sonic Advance and just expect more of the same, think again.  This game is even more about total speed getting from point A to point B than the previous games, with level design all its own.  The levels are designed so that, if you want to, most of the time you can just hold down left or right and watch Sonic (or one of the other characters) ZOOM - until you are slowed down and have to decide how to proceed.  Don't get me wrong, the levels are huge, with many paths for Sonic to take and a lot of stuff for the floatier characters (Tails and Cream) to explore.  But everything, from each level's racing-style opening to the delightful fast-driving Eggman-vehicle bosses, and especially the level design, is all about speed.  You can probably dash through the first four levels on your first game, but from zone five onward the difficulty level, both in the levels and against the (I have to mention them again) speedy frenzied moving bosses, increases steadily every zone.  The game is just difficult enough to keep me from zapping right through it, which is a good thing and keeps me coming back.  I completed the first Sonic Advance the first day but have not beaten this one yet.  I also have explored plenty and have not yet found a single chaos emerald, but I am sure they are there.  This and the difficulty curve all keep me interested.  Another thing I like are the three action buttons.  There is a jump button (essential), an attack button (with different effects depending on your character, including a ground pound that breaks floors and can aid in exploration for Sonic), and a 'trick' button, with high-speed effects that vary by situation.  What's so good is that only the jump button is necessary, but if you are fast enough and want more variety you can make the game feel much deeper by using one or both of the other buttons in just the right situations.  I don't know just how long this game will keep my interest, but on the second day I have had it, MAN is it fun.  It's all about speed.	1
this game is good for people lookin for a medium challenge game.eggmans up to his old tricks,and its up to sonic and pals to stop him! in this one u have to get amy,and here she can spin dash! instead you also have to compete for knx,tails and cream the rabbit with her pet chao cheese! He can attack bosses when its hard to reach them.so far,im on techno base zone.so buy this game and beat it!	1
Another great sonic adventure!  Dr. Eggman is up to his old tricks again, and sonic and friends must put a stop to it. Your favorite characters are back in Sonic's fastest adventure. Cream, tails, and Knuckles joins Sonic, as they start a blazingly fast quest to collect Chaos Emeralds and thwart Dr. Eggman's nefarious machines. dodge many different enemies, avoid obstacles, unlock secret areas, and uncover the hidden Chaos Emeralds to turn Sonic into Super Sonic for the final battle!  Sonic Advance 2 has excellent graphics, gampeplay, sound, and is very fun and addicting. I would reccomend this game to any Sonic fan.	1
For the longest time, I was all about Nintendo, and I was anti-anything else... anti-Sega, anti-Playstation, anti-NeoGeo, anti-TurboGrafix16, etc. Then I started dating a girl who has a Genesis, and got hooked on Sonic.  Liking the 3 or 4 games she has, I decided to buy this game for my GBA.  For the most part, it's awesome... new stages, new characters, great graphics and music... and like other reviewers said -- if you're familiar with the Genesis Sonic games, you'll be right at home with this title. However, there are a few things I really do NOT like: 1) The first several stages are pretty easy, but then they get much harder.  I'm stuck on the sky world, because there's one jump which is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to make without doing some kind of specialized new move that Sonic never had before.  I don't mind when special moves give you access to secret bonus areas, but I hate it when tricky special moves are *required* to get past a certain part of a game.  Even after reading numerous FAQ's and walkthroughs on how to get past it, I can't.  This one hurdle alone has turned me off so much, that I've practically given up on the game.  (At least until I finally break down and buy today's GBA equivalent to the Game Genie.) 2) One review for "Sonic Advance 3" mentions frustration with the fact that the game levels are so huge, it's impossible to memorize the locations of all the special items required to unlock special stages.  One thing I've never been good at in any Sonic game is memorizing the stages, or getting to the end of a bonus stage.  I know these things are "above and beyond" what's required of the basic game, but I think they forgot -- it's a GAME, it should be fun.  When I want hard work, I go to my job. 3) You can't access all the characters until you "unlock" them.  If I paid $25 for this game, I should be able to access ALL the features right off the bat.  I shouldn't be required to play the entire game all the way through with 4 different characters just to unlock a 5th character who'd probably be wind up not even being worth the effort.  How'd you like to pay $25,000 for a car that doesn't allow you to access all its features until you've driven a certain number of miles or you've successfully completed some 43-key sequence on the stereo in 25 seconds or less?  Same goes for the Gamecube Sonic Mega Collection -- I paid enough for it, I should be able to play ALL the games immediately... none of this "unlocking" bullcrap. 4) I alluded to this in the previous item -- once you unlock new characters, it's like they have their own "account" in the game.  For example, you can't have Sonic play the first 3 acts, then have Tails take over.  Each character has to play through the entire game on their own.  I guess it's a neat way to learn each character's differences and advantages -- but I'd prefer the "Super Mario Bros. 2" style of character selection... where ALL the characters are available all the time, and you can choose the person who is best suited for each stage.	1
Sonic Advance and Sonic Advance 2 are great games but are a little like the F Zero games in the aspect that you like the levels a lot but you just want more so you wish for a sequel and then when it comes you still want another one cause you like it so much but are slightly bored at playing the same levels over and over. I guess thats what keeps them from being true classics. A game like Super Mario World you don't really care if they make a sequel or not because that game is already a masterpiece. Same with Sonic Adventure. Still this game has bright colorful graphics and good music. Plus 4 characters. Its a lot of fun but you just want more,more more.	1
I got this game on the christmas of 2003-2004 an its fun! i don't have the first sonic advance cuz i heard that this one is WAY better.  I own some old sonic games (sonic 1,2 and S&K for genesis,sonic an knuckles collection for pc and sonic 1, 2 and chaos for gamegear i also had sonic pinball on genesis but now i have it on advance in sega smash pack) an this w/ sonic 2:battle (GC) r the only new sonic games i own so far. well, heres my review- MUSIC/SOUND 4/5: I luv the music on someparts like in zone 6 (the cyber space with hologram stuff) is catchy an sometimes, i heard music from previous sonic games for a few senconds an the VERY LAST boss fight tune was cool but the VERY LAST boss sorta looked like a rip off boss fight from a game called SPARKSTER (snes) but then again it wasn't a complete rip. all in all u will enjoy the music.the sounds were good too but i sorta wished the characters had some voice in the game but its ok. GAMEPLAY 5/5: awsome! this is more uv a race thru level game (even more than the old sonics) with few enemeis. u earn characters along the way such as tails, knuckles and a new recruit in the sonic saga! its a little girl rabbit named Cream and her CHAO named Cheese (cream cheese, get it?)an there is a character u can unlock an i know who it is althogh i haven't earned him/her yet... u should no that ure first person u have is (obvoisly) sonic an i beat the game with him an cream an im workin on tails rite now, i haven't earned all the chaos emeralds but to do so, u need to get 7 secret rings in each act (excluding boss acts) an u need to get those emeralds to unlock more features in the game. u can also do time trail mode which u choose a player to run thru the act as fast as u can which adds to replay but ill get on with that later... u can use data with chao linking to SA2-battle an do stuff but i don't know what unfortanatly... REPLAY 5/5: Plenty to do here! beat game with all 4 characters with collecting a total of 28 emeralds (u need to get the chaos emeralds with EACH character!) then unlocking other goods along with earning ANOTHER character (now total of 35 chaos emeralds to collect) plus u can do (i didn't mention this in GAMEPLAY) multiplayer with up to 4 people an i never did it but my big sis has this game so i should ask her sometime... an again, there is time trail to get your absolute best with EVERY character so there is A TON to do here but when u manage to finish it all, u can still play the game (recommended doing this AFTER u did everything else multiplayer is optional tho) again with ure favorite character (mines sonic so far) CHARACTERS: SONIC:coolest of the lot (in my opinion), he foiled dr. Eggmans (gee thats a stupid name! what happened to Robotnik?) plans MANY times in the past. he can run really fast an do moves like back flip in mid-air or spin-kick forward. Cool huh? CREAM & CHEESE: Unfortanatly, shees just a mimick of tails with worst flight controls (she flies with her big, floppy, ears) but she has good sprites (when she grinds on rails, is the happy or screaming?)! she can sorta spin forward an use CHEESE as a weapon. I think she deserves to be in the sonic crew all in all! TAILS (MILES): Ok he is not really new at all in the sonic saga (first appearance: Sonic 2 genesis i think) he is sonics sidekick an can use his tails to fly but he doesnt really have alot uv moves but he is still awsome an deserves to let him go thru the game, u won't regret it! KNUCKLES: Sorry! i didn't get to try him out yet but ill upgrade this when i do! the only thing i really bet he can do (unless sonic team got drunk which hopefully they didn't cuz they rock) is glide in mid-air cuz he did in previous games so its either gonna be sonic or him as my fav! ???: Yup! this is the mystery character an i never tried him/her out cuz i didn't unlock him/her but i know who the character is (sorta obvouis)... RENT/BUY/NEVER TOUCH/USE TO THROW AT WINDOW: Definate buy even if u missed out on old school sonic games or even the new ones (all the stories are pretty much the same)!!! This will be awsome for road trips (if u don't get carsick that easily) an is jus fun to play again an again! u can get the first sonic advance if u want but uv what i heard, u should get this one or better yet both! I didn't write this long reveiw for nuttin so go get it now!.....umm why u still here...? GO! GET IT NOW! well by for now!.....no really BYE! *runs away*	1
For the graphics capability of the gameboy advance, and the quality of Sonic games that origionally appeared on the Sega Genesis/Megadrive, this one was badly put together. Just like the first Sonic Advance, this game has you running around loops and slopes so much that you hardly run into any of the adventurous level layouts that SONIC TEAM so well thought out when creating Sonic games for the Genesis Platform. I'm an advanced gamer and I found myself dying way too often in this game, mostly from running sonic into bottomless pits. This game is a pass	-1
This game is better than I could have hoped for. I would go so far as to say that this game is better than all of the classic Sonic games made for the Genesis. The addition of Cream is great. She fits right in with the rest of the characters. The graphics are wonderful. All of the characters have new animations but handle exactly as they should. The audio is classic Sonic and the boss battles are challenging but not too difficult. Since most all of the characters must be unlocked in order to play them this adds tons of replay value. And above all else, it's just a fun game to play. Graphics: 5.0 Sound: 5.0 Control: 5.0 Fun Factor: 5.0	1
This game is a whole lot better than the first! More in depth and larger levels. It's a little harder than the first but to really notice the difference I suggest trying the first before you buy the second. It's a keeper!	1
Sonic Advance 2 is probably the greatest handheld game youll want to play while on the road!  This game also marks Creams first appearance, and is she powerful!  You have plenty of levels to play, and some attack modes to clear.  Its classic Sonic 2-D game play for those of you who have been fans since 1991.  The only con on this game is that you have to unlock everyone!  Id give it a 4.5/5.  Also, you might want to invest in an SP once you reach Techno Base.	1
The kids should really dig this game from Activision; most of them won't have any problem racking up high scores since they have played Tony Hawk a million times already.  This game uses the trick/control engine from the popular Hawk series.  Lots of levels, tricks, neat hidden stuff, etc.  This title is worth the cash, for both the kids and their parental units.	1
I haven't had this for very long, but so far it has worked pretty good.  It comes with a memory card which is put into slot B on the gamecube, and a disc.  To use it, you turn on the gamecube with the memory card and the disc in it.  It comes up with a menu, one option being to load codes for the game you want to play.  We've tried it with Burnout and Driven and worked fine.  I tried to use it with Super Mario Sunshine to access all levels and worlds - the 1st time the game locked up and the 2nd time I still couldn't access unopened areas. Oh well.  To update codes, we have to input them manually.  Maybe with the optional modem for gamecube, you'll be able to download the codes at some point ...	1
GREAT PRODUCT	1
This guy here lets you play imports and cheat. *giggle*	1
Purchased for my husband	1
not so good	-1
A funny little toy. Totally worth it	1
Great product!	1
An action replay!  Awesome!!  Why not go ahead and get one.  Yeah, those Pokemon Colosseum and XD Gale of Darkness games could use some inf. money, inf. pokecoupons, and inf. masterballs.	1
Cannot put "cheats" in it as can with the AR's of other systems.  Otherwise it works well for what's needed	1
this is a good item for beginners who are just learning the basics of any game. it helps you get out of some tough places.	1
terrific good for cheat codes I love it. it is good. # 1 product. better than ever. Good to use.	1
Well, despite that this Action Replay has no feature of adding codes in this version, this Action Replay has codes that some of us needs. I need infinite health, ammo, weapons, money in all Resident Evil games on Gamecube, this is what I need. Now you gotta say to yourself "Does it have all Gamecube games cheats in this?" Well, no it doesn't, but be glad that you can get through almost the whole Gamecube Resident Evil series entirely. Anyway, for example, this Action Replay DOES NOT include Mario Party 6 cheats but all the other Mario Parties(4,5, and 7) are welcomed with codes of their own. But this Action Replay is what you need to get by some specific games on Nintendo Gamecube's good selection(Mario, Zelda, Resident Evil, F-zero GX). Action Replay Gamecube Version 1.2 includes Freeloader as well if your game is from another region. Some fun codes you wanna include will have to go to waste unless you can find the versions like 1.14 on eBay(probably high price).	1
This works great if you're on the GameCube. It doesn't seem to be too good when used on the Wii in GameCube mode. Perhaps it's how the Wii differs from the GameCube. I don't know. I know people have been giving stuff like this a bad rep lately. I think that's largely cause they think people will be cheating online or something. I don't approve of cheating that way but I think it's ok if it's a single-player game. There's mixed reviews so it's kind of hard to say. I love it & couldn't beat my single-player games without it. 5 stars from me. :)	1
It was broken when I got it the disk wouldnt read. I am going to have to send it in to the company.	-1
The GameCube Action Replay reminds me of the old GameShark.  It seems to work perfectly and there doesn't seem to be any major problems with it.	1
I always keep hearing from so many for Nintendo Gamecube owners about how they have made it through the way to the top when it comes to making their marks in defeating some of the most outrageous video games out there. Thanks to the people at Datel, they have found a way to help all Gamecube owners make their mark as video game status #1. The Action Replay for the Nintendo Gamecube is a very simple code enhancer that can help you make and break records with all sorts of great codes for video games like Super Mario Sunshine, Need For Speed Underground, Madden '06, and so much more. While not every game isn't listed, you can head on to the website codejunkies.com, and unlock codes for great games that aren't on the enhancers' menu, and simply load them up on the main screen. The device is very simple to operate, but the codes manually can take awhile to enter with your controller. Nevertheless, it is worth the effort. It is very inexpensive, and can be very helpful for any gamer of any age who owns a Nintendo Gamecube.  Price: B+  Durability: B+  Overall: B+	1
Frankly, I am surprised by the lack of disappointed buyers of this software. This is the second Action Replay I've purchased from Datel (the other being the Action Replay Max for PS2) and this is also the second time I am supremely disappointed.  First, I'll say the good things. This Action Replay is tremendously more friendly than the ARMAX for my PS2. While it is impossible to enter new games and codes on the ARMAX (or hell, even codes for games that are already there), it is very much easy to do so on the GameCube AR. The second is that the interface allows for easy access.  And that's pretty much it. That's all the good things I can say about this package. My first problem with this AR is that there is no easy way to enter codes. If you make a mistake, then you have to use the C-stick to go back, but the damn thing moves ridiculously fast. The other problem is that if you hold A, then the letter you inputted will repeat itself. Why put this in? There is no code to which this would be a useful feature.  Finally, my second and worst gripe is that there is no convenient way to input codes. I am NOT one of those guys who buys a cheating device and is content with the codes already there. I am an avid gamer who looks for the best possible codes, so I am constantly typing codes in. The problem here is that some of the best codes are extremely long. For example, the Resident Evil Inventory Editor code was 32 line long and it nearly killed me to put it in.  Next, the other problem is with the included memory card. It is completely unstable. When I first used the AR, I was so happy that putting cheats in actually worked that I made the horrible mistake of forgetting that I was dealing with Datel. By forgettng this, I had also forgotten to back up all the cheats I created. So what happens? The memory card gets messed up and I had to reformat it, thus losing all my cheats, including the 32 line RE code. I kept in mind what happened and decided to re-input codes for SSB:M (debug codes, of course). What happened? I forgot I was dealing with Datel again. What I was going to do was backup the codes after I was done inputting it. Well, when I was done, I immediately turned off the GameCube and turned it back on with the lid opened so I can backup on two other memory cards. My day was completely ruined when I discovered that the Action Replay memory card needed reformatting again.  Finally, my last gripe is that Datel has the worst code hackers I've ever seen. They have simple codes like infinite health, unlock everything, and stuff like that, but nothing truly special. By special, I mean codes like the Debug code. For those of you who don't know, debug codes allows you to have complete control over a game. For example, in Super Smash Brothers: Melee, you could use a debug code to play six players melee. And here is where the problems lies. You will NEVER see Datel input codes like that. This is why I recommend people to go to other Action Replay code sites, such as GSCentral or Action Replay Central. Don't bother using Datel's website, it is slow and useless.  Overall, Datel is probably content with what it has because it has a complete monopoly over the cheating device market on the GameCube. There is no CodeBreaker here to challenge its dominance. GameCube players are stuck. Datel also released the Action Replay MAX for GameCube (most people don't know this) on their website, but it sucks just as much as this one. The only difference is that it has newer codes.  I honestly wish that Pelican would release their awesome CodeBreaker device on the GameCube, but currently, there is no plans for that. I recommend the Action Replay ONLY because it is an excellent device to bring out the most out in any game, but I also recommend getting the MAX drive with it. The MAX drive will update your cheats quickly. Of course, this product is also made by Datel, so who knows? Not to mention it is also wildly expensive. If you plan on not buying the MAX Drive, then for the sake of your sanity, save your cheats on a regular memory card!	-1
Remember the old days where if you wanted to cheat in that hard-to-beat games, you needed a GameShark? Well, not anymore. Action Replay (or AR for short) is an alternative that from personal experience, has less of a failure rate and a cooler/easier to use interface.  Have that one game you just can't beat? How 'bout several games that you want to unlock everything for? Well, what are you waiting for! AR for GameCube comes with a special memory card and a disk that you put into your GameCube. Pop the disk in and select the codes you want to activate, then take the AR disk out and pop in your game and start gaming! It's as simple as that.  Simple of course, until you want to add new codes.  Adding new codes is a pain because the curser is way too sensitive on the onscreen keyboard and often makes it difficult to get the letter you want. Then to get the codes, you have to go online to the AR website ([...] find the game you want, copy down or worse: memorize a long, two or more line code that you must then input into the AR through a fairly simple interface.  If that doesn't bug you too much, then the plus points outweigh the negative ones. I liked this so much that I bought one for my PS2 yesterday, and I'm all over it.	1
First of all, since I live in Los Angeles, let me explain something to everyone that is playing this game all over the world: the ONLY way that this game slightly resembles L.A. is with its street names and freeway numbers - that is IT. It looks NOTHING like LA, feels NOTHING like LA, and 90% of this game is still completely made up. Yes, that's right. Anyone (and I mean ANYONE) who actually lives here knows exactly what I'm talking about. No traffic - are you kidding me? The creators of this game must live in Ohio somewhere. Street signs completely wrong half the time. Everyone, even tourists know that after Santa Monica Blvd in Hollywood the next street up North is Sunset Blvd, not whatever they put in this game. The soundtrack is probably the worst one of all video games ever created. Nothing but rap. Dialogs are extremely cheesy and stupid. The game is VERY short. The controls are aweful. One word that would also describe this nonsense of a game is BORING. Let's face it people: GTA Vice City will NEVER be beaten. I don't care how many times other developers try to mess with it, it will not happen. VICE CITY FOREVER. Bottom Line: if you have GTA expectations, or if you were a fan of Vice City, do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this game. Waste of money.	-1
True Crimes of LA is actually a pretty good game. You get to explore a much bigger city than in GTA: Vice City, but the stale gameplay and such can easily bring this game down a notch. While more realistic in everyway, True Crime can be considered one of the more innovative games of this time! First the graphics. The graphics in this game are ASTONISHING! They're almost realistic in everyway! Surprisingly enough the game looks like REAL L.A. (with the exception of there not being much traffic.). So as far as eye-candy goes, True Crimes does a brilliant job here. Now the sound. Again, no mistakes here! Good sound overall, and you can't go wrong here. Sound effects are great as well as the music. Again, you're not going wrong. The only thing I can say is that if you don't like Rap, you may not like the soundtrack as much. Gameplay is probably where te game begins to faulter. The game has a "Good Cop/Bad Cop" system which isn't a bad idea. Should you do things the way a cop in real life would (i.e. you don't kill those you capture, you only injure, you fire warning shots and only shoot people in the leg and such) then you'll be considered a "Good Cop". Do the complete opposite and you're a "Bad Cop." There is a meter that tells you on which side of the bar you fall on. Good Cop/Bad Cop isn't too badly done, but it really brings down the difficulty level of this game. It's fun to drive around but the game is so simple to keep to one side. If you see someone rob a bank you can easily just hit them with your car and not kill them, which results in you being a "Good Cop". If you hit him and kill him, you're a "Bad Cop". This becomes simple gameplay should you approach it that way. What also makes gameplay simple is that you can choose to redo any failed missions. Clearly you could try them over and over again until the game is done with. BUT you could continue and leave mission failed. If you do this it effects future missions. Missions are very realistic. You can go undercover and hope you don't blow it even. You can do various things that a cop would do. You can search them and see if you find drugs, weapons, etc. or you could flash your badge, which will result in a suspect running or something else. What's not to like about the gameplay? Well, it's too simple for one thing. I already talked about how you could hit a suspect with a car and not kill them, and this finishes missions easily. The other part is that you could easily complete missions without shooting (just knock them out). The auto-aim is very nice however. The other bad thing about the gamplay are those camera angles. You'll find yourself constantly repositioning the camera just to see some of the action. Because of the camera you could be "jumped" and never know who did it, or get shot from behind. The game presents a branching story. The outcome depends on the missions you succeed in and whether or not you're a "Good Cop" or a "Bad Cop". There are tons of ways to go through the story but the final confrontation is the same. You "could" become a bad guy but it makes no difference. The story is actually more like something you'd see in an action movie. You've got your average jerky character (Nick Kang) who doesn't want a partner and constantly refuses to work with his and goes at it alone. His father used to be a part of the LAPD but died working a case. Sound familiar? It should, and it's full of chase scenes, one liners, and everything else you could want in an action movie. So while larger than Vice City by A LOT the game is actually fairly linear. The storyline is decent (although the main character takes a bit of time to like), the gameplay is nice and overall the game is pretty good. The Good: +Great graphics and sound! +Though quite linear, TONS of missions +Lots of weapons to choose from +Branching story +Multiple endings +HUGE City to explore The Bad -Main character is unlikeable at first -Annoying Camera Angles -Missions are too simple The game overall is pretty decent. You've got a lot of freedom to enjoy and a huge map to explore. A great experience.	1
True Crime is dubbed as being the next GTA III. That's a pretty big bet, considering how good of a game and how sought after Grand Theft Auto III was a couple of years back. However, I believe that True Crime may be able to live up to what it says it can. First off, True Crime Streets of L.A. is being developed by Activision, a videogaming heavyweighr. Activision has the potential to make this game a hit. I just question how willing they are to make it good. So far, it looks to me like they are doing a fine job. At E3, the booth for True Crime was a hotspot for gamers, and the game was very impressive for all who saw it. The graphics were better than the GTA games, probably at least on par with the great graphics in The Getaway. True Crime featured 240 square miles of re-created L.A. territory, and the city looked great. The game just had the atmosphere of L.A. There was Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and even ghetto paradise within the game. There were hot rides in hot areas of the city, and old Buicks in the not-so-nice parts as well. (I prefer the ghetto life!) The people were good too. There were gangstas, ho's, businessman, snobs, everything that you would actually see in real-life L.A. Landmarks were recognizable, from the skyscrapers to the Mann's Chinese Theater. The sound was just flatout AWESOME as well. Cars were realistic, pedestrians chatted, music pumped in the background. And as a bonus, there will be over 50 beats from real life west coast rappers like Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. I am psyched about that!! I am a huge rap fan! The sound to me seems just as good or possibly better than the awesome sound effects in GTA Vice City. You play as a cop, Nick Kang, who can either be good cop, or bad cop, whichever road you wish to put him on in the game. And the game will tilt that way too. Be a baddie, and you'll be swarmed by vigilantes and even your fellow police. Be a good guy, and the game may be a little easier or a little harder, depending on your view. So far, True Crime looks awesome. It could give the GTA series a run for its money. Roll out the red carpet this fall. Here come True Crime Streets of L.A.!	1
This game WILL NOT be another Grand Theft Auto spinoff, mainly because it's from a different perspective, and it's a perspective that GTA (Grand Theft Auto) would never go to, you play as an officer of the law, that's right, a cop, a pig, the fuzz, the filth, whatever you want to call it, you're a police officer.  Sure, there's still a lot to do with crime, and you steal cars, there's hand-to-hand combat, and there's drive-by shooting, but you're still on the "good side".  Another valid point is that this game takes place in an actual city; not a make-believe city like Grand Theft Auto.  This city is so photorealistic that it would actually help ou get around if you bought a map of Los Angeles so that you know where you're going.  This is the second game to do that... the first, as you should all remember is The Getaway... wasn't that an awesome game?  Ok, anyway, BUY THIS GAME... YOU WON'T REGRET IT!	1
another line up in the world of crime as we take in the next great thing with an attitude this game just may surpass gta in a way that makes people say (no way) yes it looks that good but the question is (is it that good) well i managed to get an interview with lead vice president of Activision company and he told me what he wanted to tell me and that was enough to assume that vice city would become a kids toy after this maniac of a game would be released yes of course its not out yet but vice president of activison said to me that this is an game that will  become something to remember in other words Let The New Franchise Begin!!!!!!!!	1
If you haven't played this from the previous Gen, you should find the time to as this game is one of the most enjoyable games that you could ever play. Similar to Grand Theft Auto, you play as this Character who is a cop and you get to run down Los Angeles arresting people and doing Storylines that lead to fun Boss fights.	1
What makes this game go from average to good is the plot. The gameplay itself isn't that great. The controls are difficult with moves being tough to pull off and the driving is pretty sluggish. Both these problems were fixed by the sequel True Crime: New York City. Which is the stronger and more entertaining game. This is fairly short and I was hoping that wouldn't be all there is to it when it ended.  This is an open-world game mixed in with some John Woo type action. Some gunplay and even a dojo to learn extra martial arts moves. It did have some charm that pulled me in and I found myself actually having fun despite the downfalls. While it isn't as necessarily as good as the GTA games, it's still a fun ride playing the role of a detective. You can't really enter buildings or anything and the city looks pretty much the same throughout the world. A lot of product placement is here in all its glory.  It's worth a shot to play but it's way too short. I beat the game in less than 10 hours.	1
Not quite as fun as I remember it being but it brought back some memories and was worth it for the price.	1
I'm just grateful for the quality I received this product! Can't wait to play!	1

You are the law in True Crime Streets of LA and you, to a degree, get to decide what the law is. As an agent of a independent law enforcement organization you get to choose how to uphold order and bring justice to criminals to an extent. There is a pretty 90's grade cop movie story that gives the game direction and it's pretty well written and very exhilarating. Plus, you can choose to be a good cop or bad cop and that actually will branch into different story lines. The open world of LA is pretty expansive, in fact almost to expansive as a fair amount of the map is bland and not very memorable but a big place to roam around and play in none the less. Enemy conflicts are where the game shines the most with some of the best hand to hand combat fighting of the time. The gun play is also very unique and innovative. You'll be constantly diving around dual wielding all kinds of mix matched weapons and feeling awesome while you do it. True crime is a complete single player package and well worth the money. I would say buy this game if you own a PS2	1
good?	1
Works Great	1
This game is something along the lines of Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row.  You drive around the city, do side quests, and shoot or beat up people.  The difference, this time you're the good guy so your hands are tied.  Some dumb pedestrian gets in your way, no running them down, you take a penalty.  I've even seen them literally dive into the street from the sidewalk before.  Hey though, you're a cop so you're taking care of the people.  So how do they repay you?  Well, a fair amount of the time you go into break up a fight, both people fighting will attack you.  That's probably realistic, so no big deal.  However, the loving citizens also ignore your siren, routinely crash into your police car, and at one point after maybe a couple hours playing ran me and an AI controlled cop down in the middle of the street and kept going.  Delightful.  The music that plays is something that parents will want to be aware of.  A delightful little tune My B---h A-- N-ers is apparently the favorite tune of the main character.  I'm not very PC, but that was off putting and the song itself was terrible.  Seems like it's just in there for "shock value".  There may be a way to change the radio station, but I haven't found it yet.  That's a problem with the game, it doesn't have what you'd consider a real "tutorial".  A lot of stuff you'll only find if you read some guide or the hints on the load screen.  Add to that a shooting mechanic which is utterly awful, and a system of getting upgrades that punishes you if you fail the tutorial for getting them by deducting a badge, and it's like someone designed it to intentionally be frustrating.  I mean, you look at it and it's got the makings for a really good game, but by the middle of Act III, I was ready to just slaughtering every single citizen I could find for the shear joy of shutting them up.  I also found myself hoping they suffered...  The game may give you enjoyment depending on your tastes, and it's the closest thing I've played to Saints Row 3 on the PS2, but I'm finding it far more work than it's worth to be a "Good Cop" for the better ending.  I'm probably going to go back to playing Gun.	-1
This is definitely one solid title to get your hands on if you are looking for something a little different than GTA.  This time, you're the law and you're doing your best to not break it.  But, there are a lot of things that came from this game that GTA has included or other games from RockStar, including solving crimes to increase your stats, and interrogation.  This is a must-have for your Open-world game collection.	1
You can play this game basically 3 different ways. You can complete the missions and do your job like you are intended to; you can be a good cop patrolman and simply drive around town arresting criminals for concealed weapons and for having drugs and responding to police calls, or you can simply go crazy; fight civilians, shoot civilians, fire warning shots at civilizans, run people down, arrest people and shoot them with their own concealed weapon, basically run around Grand Theft Auto style!! Basically choose your own adventure! Lots of fun either way!!	1
This is the city of endless clips and vendettas in need of recompense. I am a fan of this series as it stands and this game didn't disappoint!	1
was exactly as pictured.  this was a gift for my daughters boyfriend & he loved them.  Would recommend this to anyone.	1
True Crime Streets Of LA is an open-world type of Grand Theft Auto game. You play as an LA cop,who fights and shoots his way through bad guys. There is a storyline you can play through,including optional alternate missions within the storyline. Plus,you can go around LA responing to crimes and stopping gang members,thieves,muggers,and other types of criminals. You can either be a good cop,by just slapping the cuffs on them,or be a bad cop,by blowing them away. The choice is yours. You can also upgrade your martial arts fighting skills,by training in the dojo thats on the map. There are other places on the map that you can go to and interact with also. Such as target practicing...and more. These places must be unlocked by getting points,from stopping different crimes though. Snoop Dog can also be unlocked in this game,via a cheat code or by collecting all the dog bones on the map,to unlock the "dog patrol" missions. Overall,this game is very fun to play and I highly recommend it.	1
I have this game, I remember the first time I brought it,The story is a little wacky at times, But it's fun even if silly at times, it's not GTA of course. lots of product placement in the game, decent not great soundtrack, the controls are a little off at times. not so great graphics,pretty fun at the time.	1
This game rocks!! I love it!! It's graphics are not that great, but it's fun, the story is a little off, but it doesn't matter the game makes up for it in the missions!! YOU MUST BUY IT!!	1
THE SHORT: A free-roaming game similar to Grand Theft Auto but with enough personality and uniqueness to stand on its own. A clichd storyline and some control issues mar things, but its addictive gameplay and flexible mission style make it worth playing.  THE LONG: When this game was released, some unfairly called it a GTA clone. Sure they're both about grabbing any car that comes along and moving about a large city, taking on missions and causing havoc. But True Crime is definitely different. To begin with, in TC you star as a police officer, and your missions revolve around trying to solve an increasingly complex case. And unlike GTA, your role as a "good guy pushed to the edge" allows you to play as a good or bad cop depending on your actions. Being good (not killing people or attacking innocent civilians, etc) earns you higher rewards that allow the purchase of dozens of upgrades to your character, guns, and cars. But being bad takes away those points, and if you want any of the better stuff you have to work back up. The nice thing about True Crime is that you're allowed to play both ways, whenever you choose. Street crimes happen regularly, and it's up to you how you handle every one of them.  Similarly unique to this game is the mission structure, which is actually better than GTA. In that series, once you're on a mission you either fail or succeed, and while there are sometimes more than one place at a time to get missions, if you can't beat them then you're stuck to keep trying. In TC, you're often given the choice to keep playing the storyline even if you fail. On these occasions you're given an alternate cinema scene and may even have a slightly different next mission. This will eventually usually lead you to one of the more negative endings, but it's way better than just hitting the wall of a tough mission and playing it repeatedly until you get it right. It should also be noted that, unlike GTA, you can replay any mission in the game at any time.  One similarity to GTA is the way these goals are set up. In both games you are introduced to the mission by way of a cinema scene, and then you are given control to access your next goal, usually at your own pace. In both games you're free to roam around and steal cars or rough up civilians, but this is another instance in which TC is, at least, more flexible than GTA: In this game, events such as driving to a bar, having a fight, then chasing a fleeing suspect are each their own individual events. This means that, with the option to replay a level anytime, if you got killed chasing that suspect you can just replay that part instead of starting over all the way back at square one, the "driving to a bar" segment. And being that the game auto-saves after every successful mission segment, you're constantly making progress and can pick up where you left off and leave chasing that suspect until after dinner. Some would argue that this makes the game a little too easy, which is true- Vice City and San Andreas are more difficult. But they're also more frustrating sometimes.  Aside from the story, the meat of the game boils down to what you're doing between missions. Personally this is my favorite part of the game. For one thing, you get a giant scale version of Los Angeles and all its suburbs. I'm not from California but I was stranded on an L.A. street corner at 3 am, and I was able to locate this very intersection in the game, looking very accurate. In this large city, you can pat down citizens for contraband or attack them outright at the touch of a button, or if that's not your bag then you can wander on foot or in a car and take on the random street crimes. About once every thirty seconds or so, there will be armed muggers to bust, stolen buses to stop, street races to interrupt, and so on. And again, it's up to you to either do it right (shooting that mugger in the arm) or get some bad cop points (shooting the mugger in the head through the victim's torso). The freedom to roam and have this power and take on these endless crimes is, in my opinion, addictive thanks to the fluid animation, smooth controls, and unpredictability of each situation. Sometimes that catfight will turn into a full-on gun battle, and again, it's up to you how to handle it. A stat menu keeps track of your every action, so you can see just how many of those people you frisked were carrying (with a percentage display of how good your guesswork is).  Lastly, the game's presentation. The graphics are pretty good and the animation smooth, even though it's a couple years old at the time of this writing. There's loads of dialogue that's synched up well, though much of it is straight out of B level hard-boiled cop movies. It's tongue in cheek, but I couldn't help laughing when an important character leapt in front of me in dramatic slow-mo while yelling "Noooo" and taking a bullet. The sound effects are pretty crisp, but the music is straight-up rap unless you get the Xbox version and use your own soundtrack. The controls are decent (with a much more thorough martial arts fighting system than anything out of GTA) but the camera is almost always a pain. It's movable, but it almost never seems to stay where you want it as you run around the streets changing directions.  In all, if you're a fan of action games or GTA then you should give this game a shot (Spider-Man 2, by the same team, share some similarities with this game as well). It's older now so you can find it for ten bucks or less, which at 10-30 hours of gameplay is not bad at all.	1
On the X-Box or PS2 I could see where this game could be bearable. The PC version is quite a different story. There is no support for a game pad or joystick, so the only options are keyboard and mouse. The huge map, large assortment of cars and plot mean nothing if you can't control the character or his vehicle.  I have never seen controls in a game this lethargic. If you derive some kind of joy from knocking over trees, street lights, sign posts, newspaper stands and parking meters, this is the game for you. Not to worry, on a straightaway the sensitivity returns ensuring your course is as predictable as the lottery. The camera angles seem specifically design to ignore the subject of importance. Sometimes while apprehending a suspect for no apparent reason, the camera will relocate on the other side of a building. During the timed martial arts progression tests, half the time is spent scrolling the lazy (at full sensitivity) camera to look at the target and align the character. It's not a contest of skill, but a struggle with technical ineptness.  As for any bugs I have had multiple crashes, from menus locking up to sound loops. My system is fully of capable of playing Doom3, Far Cry and Star Wars Galaxies, so I can assure you it falls well within the basic hardware requirements as well as the latest drivers and direct-x. It's a shame, the game looks good, has a bit of freedom to do side missions etc. If it was playable, I'd be playing it. To sum it all up, it's a good game idea, wrapped in technically flawed garbage.	-1
You probably heard it's like GTA and I know that gets annoying compareing games to GTA.  The graphics are average with a pretty good selection of music.  I like the fighting system they have when you take somebody on one on one with you fists.  The driveing could of been better and I think that's what dissapointed me the most.  I like the idea of how you can kill people and be a bad cop or help people out and be a good cop.  The missions and story line aren't to bad for being this type of a game.  You can also frisk people on the street for drugs or shoot a warning shot in the air to warn criminals.  This game is totally worth paying 20 to 30 bucks for.	1
this game is fun. its as simple as that. there are some really stupid people THAT ONLY TRY DEMOS. i say this to them, demos suck. the map is HUGE! there are a ton of cars. the last guns u get rock. i no this stuff cause ive beaten it. its hard at times, and easy at times. if u ever get stuck or mad or just wanna have more fun, go to [...] and get some nice codes!	1
This game can be comparred GTA: Vice City but no helicopters or motorcycles and the music could be better. But the storyline makes up for it the classic cop seeking the truth to what happened to his father. The guns also are good the upgrade are ok and the fighting is fine. But one draw back is when you are fighting a major boss you cannot use your guns. The best part is you cannot die. But if you are looking for a replacement For GTA this is not your game. If you want a roaming game or just a way to releive tyou stress (go on a killing spree) this is your game. The senless violence and language aside I do not really understand how this game revived the rating that it did. There is no blood in the game, expect for the final movie	-1
this is what i like to call a wannabe. wannabe games leach off the success of blockbuster games, such as, o i don't kow, GTA!! this game is exactly what GTA is, except your a cop instead of a villian. GTA now has a double pack, thats both GTA 3 and vice city for less than this one steaming pile of wannabe. GTA will do everything this game trys to much better, and you'll feel like a bad ass a long the way, instead of some tool with crappy one liners.	1
My high expectations for this game were shattered after I played it.  This game does not boast any positive aspects that I can think of, therefore I will mention the cons.  First off, the car physics are atrocious.  Or better yet I should deduce that there are no car physics.  It seems like the developers spent no time trying to make this feel realistic.  Taking corners doesn't have a solid or natural feel.  The car usually turns too sharply.  The fighting is equally lack luster and repetitive.  When I say repetive, people that are reading this and have played the game are nodding their heads in agreement, because repetitive is the perfect word to describe the fighting.  You'll press a couple buttons, maybe you'll have a gun at times, but it never induces a feeling of fun.  I found myself randomly pressing buttons just waiting for the adversaries to die.  When you want the game to end after a half hour of playing, it means it's time to hand the control to some unsuspecting victim and get away while you can.  Luckily I played this game at my friend's house.  And he was borrowing it from another friend, so neither of us had any money deficits to complain about.  Dropping $50 on a game like this would be unfortunate.  I truthfully cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I would not even recommend it to my worst enemies because playing this game is too harsh of a punishment.  If you want to see how bad it is you are free to rent it, just be aware of how much fun you are not going to have.	-1
Many have written much on this game, so I will try to keep this brief and avoid repeating what's been stated. This game has the right elements for a good game, and even a storyline that's just solid enough to lay the foundation for an interesting game, but Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, it's not. It's not even on the level of Dead to Rights. Some levels are just plain too short making you feel more like a passenger than the one in charge -- you take down a foe and the game quickly jumps to a long cutscene, making you feel like an observer to the action. It doesn't have the feel, the tension, the sense of inhabiting a real world as you experience playing "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City." It feels too much like a game, and can feel flimsy and flat; it just doesn't have the depth or passion/vision to pull you in. In contrast, GTA feels like an experience. True Crime doesn't know what it wants to be: or, more accurately, it wants to be GTA but falls far short. Sure, it's good to have lofty ideas, but when you fall short, you usually fall hard. Perhaps, in contrast, that's why Jet Li's "Rise to Honor" succeeds: it may be simple and straightforward and even a throwback to games from the 80s/Nintendo 8-bit era, but it doesn't overstep its bounds and gives you a fun, entertaining game with enough variety levels (some times, you're shooting down enemies stalking an alley, others you're taking down groups of thugs armed with bats/4x4s with your martial arts skills, running away from a helicopter, dodging bullets, hiding behind furniture/cabinets/cubicles as you run from one side of a office building floor to another, fighting a boss in a gas-filled room, or against a boss while your friend is hanging on the edge of a balcony as you fight against time to save your friend, etc. etc.) The makers of True Crime, if they don't improve their execution on their next outing, could learn something from "Rise to Honor," which is a must-have for Jet Li fans and possibly even for older gamers in their late 20s or early 30s.	1
Everyone( including me )was thinking that True Crime would crush the afforementioned titles, but they were wrong. DEAD wrong. In attempting to seamlessy blend in elements of Max Payne, Dead to Rights, and Grand Theft Auto, they forgot several things-story, replay value, and controls. The replay value consists of playing as Snoop Dogg. Whoop-de-stinkin-doo. The controls, while aren't the worst kind of controls, they definitely should have been tweaked better to outmatch GTA,MP, or DTR. The driving isn't bad, but it certainly not going to beat Grand Theft Auto. The fighting is very weak,depending on button-mashing more than skill and the moves are extremely slow, unlike Dead to Rights, which requires actual skill. And finally, the shooting. The aiming is cumbersome and will require patience and a keen eye. Plus, it rips off both Dead to Rights and Max Payne with the slow-mo dodge, but fails to outdo either one. Also, is it just me or does every pedestrian fight like they've spent time in a Shaolin temple? Believe me, you'll be in tears when you're getting (...)kicked by winos and Martha Stewarts-lookalikes. The soundtrack is supposedly made up of rap songs. I'm not a big fan of rap or Snoop Dogg. However, only the rock songs are the good songs on here. Now, aside from all the nit-picking I've done, there is some good here. The shooting system allows you to pick up 2 guns at once( for example, you could have an M-16 in one hand and a shotgun in the other ) which is kind of fun. One thing the driving does have on GTA is the ability to aim inside your car, which is neat too. The graphics are pretty good. The voice talent, consisting of Christopher Walken, Michelle Rodriguez and Michael Madsen, is interesting to hear. Unfortunately, the bad outweights the good. If you're smart, you'll either rent True Crime or go and buy Max Payne, Dead to Rights, or GTA. They may be slighty older games, but they're definitely a lot better than True Crime. (...)	-1
but my friend rented it for a week, and he said it is better than GTA3 and GTA: Vice City. which i was surprised because i have heard this game blows. but gta is amazing and my friend owns gta: vice city, so TRUE CRIME must be great game! nice work	1
This has got to be the worst game ever made!!!!  The missions are easy as hell!!! There are stupid multiple endings wich are not that important to me.  Kungfu|!!!!! WOW!  At least gta had an actual criminal who can do s**t.  Big deal,rap music! GTA3 had true gangster music wich was scarface!  True crimes blew big time.  I rented it and beat it in 2 days wich wasn't that much time for me to do.  Over all it sucks. IF you want a true gaming masterpiece get Grand Theft Auto3 or vice city THIS GAME SUCKS, there are no helicopters no motorcyles ect just plain stealling cars.  Hey miday Why don't you come up with something Original! I GIVE IT -1000000000	-1
At a first glance, True Crime: Streets of LA is just another GTA clone.  But when you actually get into playing it, it becomes a LOT different, and a lot more interactive. As Nick Kang, your job is an LA flatfoot with a short fuse.  Your antics have gotten you in trouble more than once, and currently you've been suspended.  But, the police chief decides to give you a second chance by admitting you into the Elite Operations Division (EOD) to try to crack down on a major threat the Chinese Triads have forced upon your city. Like GTA, you can "steal" any car you want to drive.  The only difference is that as a police officer, you're just commandeering them.  But as you progress though the game, you learn driving techniques, such as quick turnarounds, nitro boost, and even riding on two wheels. The shooting system is a bit far-fetched, but works out fairly well.  Your basic handguns (because Nick likes to shoot with two) have unlimited shots.  They do, however, have a number of rounds in the chamber, so you will have to reload them once in a while.  You can pick up other weapons, including Kalashnikov assault rifles, SPAS shotguns, and .45 revolvers, but those guns DO have an ammo limit.  In addition to just your normal target-and-fire abilities, you can learn different types of attacks by visiting shooting ranges. Last but least, Nick is also a martial-arts master.  When trying to apprehend suspects, you can use your kung-fu to take them down instead of shooting them (which can get you into trouble).  As you visit more dojo locations, you learn more combos and special attacks that can help you kick your enemies to the pavement. The story is very rich, with an interesting cast of characters, and very good voiceovers.  There's an aire of maturity of a good shoot-em-up action film, plus a lot of comedy throughout.  You get to explore the entirity of Los Angeles in full detail, from the ratty subdivisions to the high towers of the downtown district, even all the way up to Hollywood and Beverly Hills. A few drawbacks do exist, though.  Seems like the missions always involve the same premise, but just get a bit more difficult each time you do them.  More mission diversity would've been nice.  Also, crime happens EVERYWHERE, even as you're just standing around outside of your car.  These crimes are optional to do, but they can be distracting when you're trying to get from one place to another.  And the soundtrack is almost completely west-coast rap.  I'm not a big fan of rap myself (I'm more partial to heavy metal or rock), so I turned the radio off.  Kind of gets weird when you don't hear anything while you're driving around. Overall, this gets an 8 of 10.  It's fun, it's well designed, and it'll keep you entertained.  I recommend a rental before you buy, though.  Some people who are GTA fans may not like it.	1
I heard about True Crimes and played it. I was thinkin what eveyone else was thinkin GTA Max Panye, but supprisenly It was better! I loved Vice city witch is what Maima is played as, but actural L.A. This game kicks butt. You bust thugs shoot up hoods and steale cars. All the fun gangster things to do while being a cop. Plus you can be Snopp doggy dog and be smokin jay and bestin people at the same time. This game flat at rocks the house	1
THIS GAME BLOWS!!! BUY "XIII" IT ROCKS!!! I DION'T EVEN WANT TO GET INTO IT BUT ITS THE SHORTEST GAME I HAVE EVR PLAYED AND ON TOP OF THAT THE GAME PLAY IS DULL?	-1
I thought this game would be great and they didn't let me down.  It's hard not to compare this to Grand Theft Auto for obvious reasons.  It's too bad the controls of different cars weren't as smooth as GTA's.  Lots of times it feels like you're sliding instead of rolling.  The only other gripe I have is that stupid dragon boss fight.  I didn't see any sense in adding this "horror" feature to a "shooter" game.  These two quirks prevented me from giving it 5 stars.  Surprisingly, I did enjoy the fighting scenes.  I stay away from fighting games because I am no good at them and they just don't interest me, but this game made it easy.  Although I did not learn all of the special finishing moves, the three I did know got me through it.  Upgrading your fighting, driving, and shooting skills got tougher, but the challenge was fair. The city is HUGE, bigger than any other map I've played in a game, except maybe "The Getaway".  The side missions are endless, which gives it great replay value. Oh yeah, stay away from "No One Lives Forever" for Playstation 2 unless you plan on using the CD as a frisbee or a coaster.	1
It's boring, with nothing to really do.	-1
well i love it and my son does also i have beaten it and woould do it again cause it is ver addictive and i would recommend it to anyone who doesnt want to have to work to hard at play but wants a more relaxed play with enough challenge to keep you trying but fun to keep you hooked	1
True Crime is not a complete GTA clone, but instead of just running around and killing people, you get to go on missions.  Yes, your probably thinking that i haven't played GTA to its fullest, but i have.  I own gta 3 and gta vc, and i love them.  This game takes the character and throws him into underground tunnels to do Max Payne/Enter the Matrix action.  The weapon system is like State of Emergency because you pick up weapons, use them, and lose them.  Now instead of stopping there, they threw in a whole Street Fighter thing.  After you drive ruthelessely, dodge bullets, and hang with hookers, you get to beat the crap out of your enemies the Street Fighter way.   Oh, and one more thing, the BEST part of the game is the in car gun duels.  Driving by on behind someone and IN SLOW MOTION blowing them to smitherines, is by far the coolest thing.  Think MATRIX RELOADED for the highway scene and than think of a videogame,  GTA style.	1
Is the same as playing any Mario or other platform game but with female leading characters. Girls will have hours of entertaiment with it on long traveling trips. The backgrounds are very good looking, but not much detail on the characters themselves. Sound and music are very nice and never tiresome or boring. Game has a feature to control their volume. And just because is based on Disney's fairy tales films and is aimed primarly at girls dosen't mean is too easy to win, especially is you use the non easy mode. The password feature is annoying. Squaresoft should have made a version of it for PS2 and the other systems or a follow up in those systems, as it is quite entertaining. Ironicaly none of the hero princes appear at all.	1
I'm not going to tell you how I played this game. I will tell you this though: this title seriously lacks any solidity. It's basically a monotonous series of little games that are more chores than fun. As Cinderella, you clean spots all over the house and nothing more, and I can't even remember what Belle, Snow White, and Aurora do. Ariel swims around and is ever-so-vaguely remeniscent of The Little Mermaid for NES -- which is still a great game, by the way. DP is not a total loss though, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. It has it's moments: Princess Jasmin provides minor thrills on her magic carpet. But Disney could do so much better. There are no girl-gamers and boy-gamers! There are only gamers and non-gamers! You don't need sludge like this to entertain a little girl.	-1
True Crime Streets of L.A. is fun , action packed, lets get to the problem. For the first thing,there is a radio in the car like in gta3,and gta:vc,I have never heard the"f-word" in a game,except this one!!When it said strong language, I never imagined......So if your parents are sticklers with language(like mine)you have the choice to turn yhe music down in options. The controls are not like the GTA series though. The game is fun but watch the language. Im 12 and im appauled by it. If not for the language the game would get a 4.8. I didn't think activision was capable,but oh well. Note:just keep the MUSIC VOLUME down. Thats how I convinced my parents.	1
Don't set yourself up to be disappointed. Don't believe the hype. The game is not as good as they made it out to be. I barely scratched to give it a 4 star only because  it has my boy Snoop D-O-W-G doing his thing as a cop. I would never dare use the word orignal to describe this game. The fact is that you are guaranteed to like this game only because it contains so many of the elements that we gamers come to love and appreciate such as elements from vice city, max payne...etc. The game does get boring and repetitive sometimes. I also did run into a few bugs, like Nick & other characters running thru walls and characters getting stuck in the scooby doo running position. Another thing that I absolutely hate about this game is the fact that a criminal can literally stop (grab) a car that you are speeding and take you out and shoot kill you without you having a chance. I also noticed a lot of things that didn't make sense. You can search a civilian and find nothing and as soon as you turn around, that civilian is robbing someone at gunpoint...nonsense! To add to the craziness, people are getting raped in broad daylight on the side of the street (while people walked over them)...I also arrested a FEMALE rapist who I caught raping another woman...it was kinda sexy tho' I was also a bit surprised by the amount of curses. I noticed other glitches such as the enemy's guns floating in the air after you kill them. These things just cheapens the game! At this point of the review, I am so tempted to reduce their ratings to a 3; however, since this appears to be a compilation of some of my favorite games and to be honest, it is a pretty decent game, I will allow it to remain a 4 start. Go ahead gamers, buy this game. If anything you can also count on the continuous game play and crusin around LA to keep you entertained.	1
To anyone who thought that GTA 3 was revolutionary, but was disappointed with the Vice City's emphasis on gimmicks and movies over gameplay, and the Getaways lack of any useful Navigation system, this game is for you.  Out of all the GTA type games out there (GTA 3, True Crime, GTA Vice City, Simpsons Hit and Run, and The Getaway), this is definitely the second best game on that list. This game starts off with a huge part of L.A.  While not a replica of the city (like the Getaway is with London), it has all the streets, parks, landmarks and freeways of the LA area.  When I mean huge, I mean huge.  While on an uncongested freeway, burning rubber, it still takes a considerable amount of time to get from one side of the map to other.  The city map is a little too vague, but the on screen map in intuitive, and more importantly, street names are presented on screen, so you'll know if you're on Santa Monica Blvd or if you're on Highway 405.  Also, the cars handle really well, the traffic is sparse and smart, and with your customized music, it's a joy to just zoom around. This brings up the music portion.  It's almost all rap, with a few heavy metal songs filled in.  I'm not talking just some no name artists (but most of them are), but there is also major names, like Snoop Dogg, Warren G., N.E.R.D, and heck, I think there is MegaDeath as well.  All the music is made to fit the atmosphere.  The best part is, it's customizable.  There are three different sections for three different types of gameplay (cruisin', slow action, fast action), each with about 15 unique songs each to play or not play.  Simply amazing - I would say over 40 songs.  The only problem is that you can't mix one type of music (e.g. slow action) with another type (e.g. cruisin').  So while I like the N.E.R.D song "LapDance", I can only hear it in certain situations. Now to the gameplay.  There are three basic types of missions - outdoor ones involving driving through the city, indoor one with gunfire, and indoor ones with martial arts fighting.  All of these missions are short, so there is not much repeating or backtracking.  The outdoor ones are the ones where it shines.  The city is immense.  Unfortunately, the missions do tend to be on the easy side, and are either tailing, racing, escaping, or just get to a destination.  The indoor ones are not quite as fun, but the auto-aiming combined with bullet time movement makes it enjoyable, despite the camera conspiring against you.  The fighting is slightly more annoying, as it is more button mashing than anything else, but again, it's doable.  I hate all fighting games, so to me, it was the weakest type of mission. The missions are combined into episodes.  Each episode has six to eight missions, and there are eight missions to get to the best ending.  There are two alternative endings that branch off, giving a grand total of 12 episodes in all.  The best part is that all the missions are straight forward.  You don't have to look into guidebooks or ask your friends for special tricks to beat any of these missions.  Even so, beating all the missions are not required, so if there are some missions that are annoying or hard, you can skip them.  This might result in alternative missions or missing some other missions altogether.  Either way, you're never stuck. There are also side mission you can do to upgrade your skills, or you can search random people on the street, or stop crimes and run down common criminals. The only problem I have is one episode where it detracts from any sort of realism and where you fight demons, zombies, and dragons.  A couple of these missions were extremely repetitive and so badly designed that it almost made me lose respect for this game. All in all, it's a fantastic, immense, and polished game that I can't recommend highly enough. Pros: Huge city Music Customization of music Graphics Nothing too difficult No gimmicks, guidebooks needed Cons: Dragons and demons missions Too many indoor missions Fighting was pretty lame Camera angle is bad in tight spaces Difficulty Level: Easy/Medium Frustration Level: Low Hours to Complete (100% of all episodes, all endings): 20 hours	1
Imagine the free-roaming capabilities of GTA with the fighting techniques of DTR and you'll get an idea of this game. There are so many fun things to do with this game besides the main missions! You can frisk any and every person on the street for drugs or illegal weapons--though you might tick a few off enough to fight you! If you get to certain parts of town (the rougher neighborhoods) you can just stand there and watch the street crimes happen around you! And it's your choice as to how to stop them. If you take the people down and arrest them, you earn a "Good Cop" rating, but if you choose to just blow them away, you earn a "Bad Cop" rating. While this doesn't affect gameplay much, it will affect the ending of the game. The missions are fairly linear, but it's the "between mission" activities that set this game apart. You can go to the gym and improve your fighting skills (you can't do much to start out with), or go to the shooting range to get better weapons with your score (and don't expect to just walk in and start shooting-some of the targets fire back!). You're going to have to remember where everything is though, because you might have a hard time finding a hospital/first-aid station when you're really needing one in the 200+ miles of LA you're driving through. If you enjoy GTA, this is definitely one to buy. The cars handle differently, so if you're chasing a perp in a stolen vehicle, you'd better think twice before commandeering a limo to chase them with! One warning: the language here is serious, so it easily earns it's "M" rating. The only other major gripe with this game is the camera angles. You could be fighting several guys at once and have your character all of the sudden staring at the camera with no enemy in sight. And try chasing a mugger down the street when you can't even see what's going on! By the time you adjust the camera to get behind your character again, it's too late. A single button reset would have been good. Otherwise, a fun game.	1
This is an excellent game. It is loads of fun and fairly lengthy. It will satisfy any fan of Wolverine and is definitely worth playing or owning. The camera can be a little loose, but you get by. Also, some of the pacing is bad in that some levels can get very long and hard, and if you die you have to start at the beginning. It can get bothersome, but it only happens on the stealth levels: once or twice. The implementation of Wolverine's senses has been captured perfectly. When you go into sense mode, everything becomes orange, allowing Wolverine to see the green scent trails of enemies in rooms, hidden threats (landmines, laser beams), footsteps of soldiers, and points where you can pull off stealth moves on an enemy. While on the topic of stealth attacks, you can sneak up on soldiers in sense-mode, push X, and pull off a cool stealth move in order to grab the enemy's dog tags. The battle system is a bit bland, but since the controls are fairly smooth, it's still fun. Also, you can pull off melee strike attacks, with which you can down multiple enemies at once. There are several boss battles- all very fun- and a plausible story written by Marvel/Wolverine scribe Larry Hama. Several costumes are also hidden in the game, so you can play as any generation's Wolverine. The costumes include New X-Men, classic Yellow and Blue, classic Brown and Yellow, Patch, and X2 Movie. There's plenty of variety in this game, including some first person shooter elements, and plenty of cameos by other characters. I definitely reccomend it.	1
I am a big fan of x men and this game looks cool I have played a demo of it and it was ok but needs some more stuff added before it comes out	1
I beat this game in a couple weeks as I do most games that don't have on line access but this game was fun to play. I recommend it to anyone who likes an adventure.	1
its a classic like lemings and its more than one pitfall game its worth the price	1
Another great game for boys. It's nothing too fancy or difficult. Quick and easy game for younger children.	1
this was a gift for my wife that loves games like frogger, jak and ratchet series. It has great graphics, excelent play control and fun factor. Simple and you can save anytime. Great for somebody who likes simple gaming and somebody who needs to save often.	1
I heard nothing about this game when it came out a year ago and I found it in a bargain pile at Walmart for $20 so I decided to give it a try.  Well its pretty damn good considering its price and that I didn't even hear about it when it first came out. The characters and the story aren't exactly as "cool" as say Resident Evil 4 or God of War type games, in fact the characters are kind of geeky. But the gameplay is awesome  a lot of fun with tons of moves and obstacles and action from te beginning to the endof the game. Controls are tight and well done. I recommend this game to anyone if they see it in the store give it a try like i said the charcters and the story might not be so cool  but the gameplay is.	1
I finished this game last night and what a blast the journey was.  I bought this game to take my mind away from work and school but I got hooked.  When I thought I was stuck, it was because I had overlooked something -- you really have to use your wits and analytical skills sometimes!  My boyfriend and I played together, he took some platforms and I did some.  I thought the graphics were superb and it has made me a snob against games whose graphics are not as advanced.  I'm no gamer-expert, just a casual user so I'm really no authority on graphics but this was fantastic.  The other reviewer was correct -- you have to work at timing your vine jumps and sprints to get to where you want to go.  This game was witty, exciting and aethetically marvelous.	1
Me and another friend were a little tired of playing Halo online, and needed something different to play.  Nothing I've found so far has been able to beat Halo.  I saw this game, and was interested because it was a Star Wars game.  The back said that it was multiplayer, so I picked it up.  I soon learned that multiplayer doesn't mean that me and my friend can play this game together on a split screen.  There were a couple of multiplayer games we could, but not through the story mode, and not online.  Why go through the trouble to put just a couple of multiplayer arena's on this, and not make the whole game 2 player compatible? So, I tried it online to see how it played.  I was not impressed by it.  It seemed mostly that the person that could hit the fire button the fastest was the winner.  No real strategy.  Seemed bland, and seemed to be missing something.  It was the same feeling I had when playing MechWarrior online.  It was fun the first couple of games, but just had no substance.  I've probably played over a thousand games of Halo online, and I still find it to be a fun experience.  At least you have to think and use strategy a little. As for the story mode.  It was pretty [bad] also.  The graphics seemed ok, but the voice acting was pretty bad.  Also, I could have really seemed to care less for the story.  The whole game just couldn't hold my interest.  Really wish I would have waited for it to become a bargain game before I bought it.	-1
Star Wars: The Clone Wars is out for all console platforms, and lets you roam the Episode II world as Mace Windu, Obi-Wan and of course Anakin. You start out near the end of Episode II, racing your way to the arena and then fighting off the enemy troops after the arena battle. The game continues onward, letting you control hover-tanks, Republic gun-ship, speeders, and more. In addition there are ground combat situations where you're wielding your light-saber against various enemies. Much like the various other Star Wars games, there are a series of loosely-connected missions with main and bonus objectives on each one. You have to take out the enemy units. Escort the convoy. Destroy the main guns. The convoy shape and enemy units of the day change, but the basic tasks are the same. That's not to say it isn't fun! Pod Racer just involved racing a pod on various tracks, and we loved that. I'm a big fan of flying combat so the variety of vehicles and situations was quite enjoyable. The graphics are quite good, with plasma bursts having a series of green rings, fire-blasts looking quite realistic and dust clouds obscuring your vision. On the vehicles you drive the guns move, the antennae sway, the wing-trails dance behind you. Even better for XBox fans, this game goes LIVE! All of the fun you have in single-player mode is merely a training session for true live combat. Team up with friends and coordinate attacks on the enemy. You can even download new maps! Not a complex game requiring a lot of thought, but a fun way to blast through a weekend.	1
The game Star Wars: Attack of the Clones (SWAC) picks up where Star Wars Episode 2 left off - A massive battle filled with droids and clones and jedi. The story goes on from there to tell of the unearthing of a Sith artifact that could destroy the Republic. In the game, you play as Obi Wan, Anikin, or Mace (Samuel Jackson). There are a variety of vehicles to pilot: hover tanks, land-walkers, droid tanks, speeders, and assault ships. And while all of that may sound like a lot - the game actually feels pretty constricted. Through most of the game, you're doing the same three things: straffing, firing missles, and occasionally zooming in on targets. (The exception being on 2 missions where the emphasis is on racing in your speeder, which is pretty cool). Although the cutscenes are pretty nice, the rest of the graphics are sub-par. The sound is pretty much straight from the movie, but you'll get annoyed at hearing blasters all the time. This game is a fun little distraction. I beat it in about two days on the medium setting - which is not a long time at all. So if you're a big Star Wars fan, check out this game at your videostore and save your money for a better game.	-1
We've learned that this game works only with the original Xbox.	1
Great Game!	1
This game was listed to be Star Wars Clone Wars, but they omitted the fact that it has the Tetris game on the same disk, which will not play on the XBO 360.  Pros: Cheap price Good story line  Cons: Will only play on the old XBOX not on XBOX 360	-1
First of all, I like this game. I had for the Gamecube originally. So, I have beat this game before, but it has been a while. The Tank/Gunship portion of the game is awesome. Even though it has auto target only, you still have to line up with your target for a lock. Now, the Jedi land battle are very rough, but this is from almost 10 years or so ago. What do you expect. Graphic are good(for the time era) Story is interesting from what I remember.  Do I recommend? YES. Great game for Star Wars fans and non-Star Wars fans alike.	1
you are but a mere republic soldier who is thrown into a very big melee style war situation.its very intense and very fast paced.the best advice i can give is just bail behind anything quick and only pop out when you're sure youll kill an enemy.the object is to gain flags at other enemy posts thus taking them over.after much ado,you may win the war.then you realize youve won but one battle.you see a very large map and it shows the big picture of the war. DONT BE DISCOURAGED!the longest i lasted was 10 minutes and was hiding or in a machine the whole time.my average was closer to 1:30.its great fun if you like combat like in risk but with a visual video game to watch for the real feel.	1
We got this game and Tetris Worlds for free with the purchase of our xbox system.  The graphics are great just like the movies and its actually a lot of fun.  Its not really my type of game but i do like to play it occassionally.  However, my husband really likes this game.  Its one of his favorites, so it may be more of a guy game!  I would suggest renting it first though before buying it unless like in our case it was one of the free games with the system.  Overall a good game.	1
Star Wars: Clone Wars begins with the Jedi raid on a gladiator arena to save Skywalker and friends, which is a scene from the Clone Wars movie, then the game continues past where the movie ends with a new story. This game is a mission based arcade action style game. To start with, there are different planets, which are scenes that the missions take place. Each planet has at least three major missions to complete, with objectives to each mission, such as fighting your way on foot with your light saber, defending five clone soldiers to pilot a landing ship. That is one objective, then the ship takes off and you must pilot the ship and cover ground troops by destroying cannons and the larger vehicles, once that is done the third objective will be the enemy begins to retreat from the planet in gigantic rockets, and you piloting your landing ship must destroy the ships before they reach orbit. Now that is just one mission and the game offers different aspects of game play. One scene you will control a speedy hover tank, pressing the A button for lasers, pressing the X button for missiles, the next scene you could be on foot playing as a Jedi using your light saber, defending against lasers, pressing the A button to slice, and the X button to throw your saber (it boomerangs back). There are also missions that put you on a speeding bike pursuing guards, landing ships destroying things and picking up allies, there are also starships and jetfighters to pilot as well. Yes the controls are very simple, analog stick to move the craft or your character, X button for special weapons and A button for a laser. When you command a squadron of tanks or starships you may control the party by pressing Up on the directional pad for them to attack, Down to regroup, Left to split up and search for things, Right for them to guard a position (to set up an ambush while you do other things). There is also a nice "lock on" feature, once you get an enemy in your sights, they will be locked on, until they move out of range. This might be seen as too easy for advanced players, but the graphics are great, the game makes use of X-Box's incredible power, because it can have hundreds of soldiers and robots firing lasers on the same screen and the game is still very smooth, the loading screens happen at the beginning of each mission. Also, at the beginning of each mission and sometimes objective there is a cut scene, an animated story that continues the game's story. Star Wars has never been as good with dialog as it is with the overall story and action, so don't expect movie scripting. There are no "cinematic" movies, but the cut scenes are when the graphics really shine, when you can see Skywalker's pores on his face that is detailed. Although there are secret objectives like destroying all 100 soldiers, or completing the a mission in a few minutes, the game still does not add much replay value for those who do not like the Star Wars series. The soundtrack lacks a lot of originality, its still the same soundtrack that seems to be in all other Star Wars games (symphonic music). The online play lacks in a big way; psychology, there is no game of cat and mouse when competing against other players with the X-Box Live play, instead its just you and other people seeing who can fire the missiles the fastest.  There are team-based missions to play via X-Box Live that can be enabled by competing levels in the game. The game is rated Teen, because it can get quite difficult sometimes. Clone Wars can also be found as a part of the X-Box Live 2003 X-Box Holiday Bundle.	1
This game has absolutely NO replay value. There's nothing more to do after you beat it, unless you count the XBox Live version, which you shouldn't, because that itself is pretty bad. You are able to unlock a few things, like new multiplayer stages, videos, and a "cd player" (songs from the game, classical music mostly). The videos are just the ones from the game though, and although they're XBox quality, they're really not worth it unless you're some extremely hardcore Star Wars fan and can't miss out on the storyline. If that's the case, I feel for ya. If not, get a different game, or don't blame me if you find yourself trying to sell it right after you beat it (which doesn't take long at all.)	-1
like that cable because is more used in the phone. Verry Good Good Good Verry Verry Good Good Verry Good	1
Thank you for having this available for me to purchase at a decent price! A welcome addition to my son's collection.	1
So, if you like GTA I can't guarantee you'll like this, but it's still a fun game.  The graphics are pretty much the same as The Getaway.  Anyway, you're playing the character of an annoying Asian guy who's mean as hell and somehow passed the psych evaluation test to become a cop.  The game is definately a knock-off on the whole GTA series, yet it's not as addictive or fun.  The gameplay isn't really a freeroaming thing, it's set up like The Getaway with levels where you can free roam, but you have a certain place to be, you just don't have to go there, which is what I prefer to do.  Since you're a cop, random crimes will pop up on the map such as, rape, gunfights, carjacks, illegal street racing.  These are the most fun since you are free to do what you want when dealing with these crimes.  A car chase might lead to a wreck, and then you'll be chasing the perpetrator on foot down the sidewaks as he shoots back at you hitting innocent pedestrians making the police experience very entertaining.  There's different ways you can deal with criminals, such as holding up your badge.  They might drop their guns, but if they've already downed a few uniform cops they'll probably ignore it, or run.  You can also take your guns out and shoot a warning shot into the air.  At this they'll either break into a run or surrender.  One interesting and innovative feature is that while driving you are able to shoot out of the window ahead of your car at the car you're chasing.  This usually leads to popping the tires, and then going for the gas tank.  Also, for in-car and on-foot fighting you can use bullet time to focus as the fighting is pretty fast and it's easy to get quickly shot to death.  One of the gimmicks of this game was that it was a fighting, shooting, and driving game.  I'd have to say the worst would be the fighting mode, since it's just too annoying during the story mode.  You could just pull out your guns and shoot the people, yet you are forced to fight them.  One of these instances is a very pointless fight in a hobo house with hobos that are harder to fight than your brother who knows kung-fu.  The driving is probbly the second worse, since it's so unrealistic.  I heard that the damage would be really realistic, yet when you hit a tree you don't even slow down.  It just fades away.  The shooting is really cool though, since you can go to a semi-first-person mode with bullettime, and aim at a person possibly just disabling them instead of killing them outright.  Well, the game would be at my house if it was cheap, but it really isn't.  This XBOX version lets you put in your songs, and it is actually cool to hear your music play at random during fights and driving.  Buy at your own risk, I take no responsibility.	-1
I love this game, and the fact that the hero is actually someone not in the usual norm. Tall, Rugged, White/Black - it says something about activision, that anyone can be a hero (and reckless). This game rocks, I thought it was a usual car driving game at first, but it's actually got everything, throw in a tank and a bunjee and it could rival halo 2. well, not really, but it's got a good script, and a hot woman. Graphics could be way better, but over all it's not bad.	1
F*** GTA this game is so better than any other games like these it should win game of the year and ill tell u y. good:music,gameplay graphics,story,epsidoes,bonus upgrades,crime solving, bad:absoluteley nothing!!!! i recomend this game	1
I got addicted to this game after playing it for only a few hours. I rented it and ended up keeping it for two weeks and will be buying it when the price comes down a bit. Just for the heck of it last night i rented GTA Vice City and wanted to take it back after two hours. This game in my opinion is funner, bigger and the fighting is way better, the shooting is way better the only thing GTA has on True Crime is the driving, because you seem to be able to control your car a little better in GTA. Now Maybe GTA is a deeper game and it takes longer to get used to and it's more complex or something, i dunno, but i'd rather have a game i get right away and enjoy right away and doesn't take me a week just to have fun with it. Nick Kang is hilarious and there's some great one liners in the game. Just wish they hadn't rushed the game. It's got glitches and clipping problems galore and the car is a bit hard to control sometimes but other than that it's a lot of fun and suprisingly addictive. It's so easy to get lost cause it's so big and i really like the fact if you want to find something just look it up on Mapquest. how much more realistic can it get?	1
this game was simply a vice city in LA there was nothing really special about it at all.  i would not even recomend renting this game	-1
When i first heard about this game i was expecting a GTA rivalry but what the heck this game turned out not that good at all, the main character says the dumbest things and the gameplay isn't even that great.	-1
True Crime has the largest area I've ever covered in a game. Think about really taking a freeway from Hollywood to downtown L.A. and think about how long it would take-that's how long it takes to get there in the game. Streets are placed in ALL the right places and everything is well designed and looks just like, if not really close their real-life counterparts, oh, and if you've ever been to the Staples Center, you should check it out in the game-and LAX. Now to the gameplay...everyone was hoping it would be a buffed-up version of GTA with more area to cover, the truth is-it's not like GTA at all except for the ability to go around and shoot people. Trust me, the similarities stop there. Not only is there a great storyline to follow with multiple endings, but during the missions you have choice to go straight along them, stop the various crimes that are happening in the area (crimes range from people stealing video game trucks to disgruntled men who just lost big time on the stock market and are shooting people), or just go around and steal cars, frisk people, or shoot helpless innocents. Also, there is various facilities around the 240 square miles of L.A. that you can visit that offer training, new moves, new cars, new weapons, health, and more. The shooting, driving, and fighting engine really beat the hell out of GTA's. Especially the driving and fighting. The fighting engine is on par (and in some cases beats) with the best fighting games. This game is seriously fun, and if you like freedom, huge areas to explore, and a very good storyline, then True Crime is for you. As for the graphics-not the best seen, but also not the worst. The best things are the good car designs and the real-time reflections on the cars, also the extremely accurate city design. The music? Well, it mostly consists of aggressive rap music that matches well with alot of the gameplay. There's also a little rock found in the game. But if you don't like the music and you own the Xbox version of True Crime, you are in luck because this game supports custom soundtracks! All in all...this game is great.	1
Fans of Grand Theft Auto and The Getaway have a treat in store for them. The landscape of True Crime, set in Los Angeles, is a full 250 square miles. That's 10 times bigger than Vice City! Unlike the GTA series, this time you're on the side of the good guys. You are Nick Kang, an Asian-American who is part of an elite cop unit. You're a rough and tumble police officer who can easily shoot, fight or drive his way out of any situation. The 'fake' maps of the GTA series and the 'real' map of London in the Getaway were mere training grounds for the HUGE map of Los Angeles and all its suburbs. Drive from Santa Monica into Hollywood, grabbing up to 50 different types of cars along the way. You're not carjacking them - you're commandeering them for police activities. You have a good/bad rating and are penalized if you take out too many innocents in your quest to get the bad guys. You can find training centers to improve your skills, and take on a variety of missions. I liked this game MUCH more than the Getaway in that sense - instead of being stuck on missions in a single thread, you have much more freedom of exploring the city and deciding what to do next. The navigation is also great. The streets actually have SIGNS on them - what a concept! You also are told on-screen where you are both in suburb, a mini-map and a street sign indicator. It always drove me crazy in The Getaway that a guy who LIVES in this town wouldn't even know where he was. True Crime handles that issue quite nicely. The graphics on the XBox are extremely impressive. Car windows reflect light and can be shattered. When you run into a sign, it crumples. There are tattoo shops and fancy botiques along the streets. And even on the massive scale they cover, the trees have branches and the Japanese sports cars have legible kanji on the back. I didn't like the default set of music - I was much more impressed with the GTA3/Vice City radio station selection which was just AMAZINGLY fun. But on the up side, the XBox lets you load your hard drive full of music and play it randomly. Build your own radio stations and enjoy them! There are a good selection of sub-missions from hand-to-hand fighting, to shoot-outs, to car chases, to secret tails, to stealth infiltration and much more. There are slow-mo bullet time attacks, a fun sense of humor and destructable objects in your environments. On the down side, the game does get a little ... bizarre ... near the end, but I'll let you find that twist out for yourself. Highly recommended for any GTAVC/Getaway fan!	1
I live in LA and let me tell you, when I'm playing this game I don't have to go outside see LA. I can go anywhere in LA just by playing the game. Playing True Crime is like watching an episode of Cops, you can stick to the main story or you can chase down little street crimes. True Crime is one of those games that no one will forget.	1
I have nearly finished the game, and it is indeed a fun game to play.  One plays as Nick Kang, a rogue cop that gets things done around L.A.  The graphics is fairly decent, better than Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, but the kicker comes in the fact that there are still many, many collision bugs and on occasion, the graphics chug.  For instance, one time, my car actually got stuck in the ground literally!  Another instance was that Nick Kang went through the wall during a stealth mission.  The controls are okay, but they are not great.  For fighting sequences, generally button-mashing gets the job done (think Enter the Matrix here).  For shooting sequences, however, the great fault lies in the fact that sometimes Nick gets pulled into zoom-in sequences when you don't want it.  Lastly, sometimes, Nick suffers a tremendous delay in reaction, which results in him receiving damage. Now onto the good parts...The story is well-done, and because of their development of the character Nick Kang, one can actually sympathize with him. The branching storyline is excecuted fairly, but I wish that it was much more fluid (aka Deus Ex or Grand Theft Auto: Vice City).  The cinematics is like actually watching an old-school Jackie Chan flick.  The inclusion of a street map is great!  I wish that The Getaway offered such a counterpart.  Lastly, the multiple varieties of cars and crimes offer good diversions. Overall, this game is okay, but Activision needs several improvements in gameplay and controls.  This is a game where rental may be needed before purchase.	1
Blockbuster game of the year! GTA KILLER! I heard this over and over and over.  Don't listen to the hype.  Its not a bad game, its actually quite good but this game was OVERHYPED! I got the game yesterday and sat down to play it within 15 minutes it locked up on me.  Then an hour later it locked up on me again.  I'm not sure if anyone else is having this problem but its very aggrivating and it hasn't happened on any of my other games.  So I'm assuming that its just this game.  The missions are ok but they're very short.  In fact I beat the game yesterday twice.  But it was just the poor ending and I can branch out and get the better endings by completeing more missions.  The graphics are decent but I expected better and the frame rate drops from time to time for no particular reason.  The soundtrack is great if you like gangsta rap if you don't then you're SOL.  The music isn't censored either so if your mom is around and she doesn't want to hear the F word every few minutes then you better turn the music off.  I'm 24 and I even got irritated at having to hear the constant swearing in some of the songs.  The stealth missions are stupid.  They're very limited and feel as though they were just thrown in there so that it could be hyped up more.  I can't express how dissappointed I am with this game and its not that its a horrible game.  It really isn't.  I just thought that it was going to be the next big game and its not.	1
True Crimes of LA is actually a pretty good game.  You get to explore a much bigger city than in GTA: Vice City, but the stale gameplay and such can easily bring this game down a notch.  While more realistic in everyway, True Crime can be considered one of the more innovative games of this time! First the graphics. The graphics in this game are ASTONISHING! They're almost realistic in everyway!  Surprisingly enough the game looks like REAL L.A. (with the exception of there not being much traffic.).  So as far as eye-candy goes, True Crimes does a brilliant job here. Now the sound.  Again, no mistakes here!  Good sound overall, and you can't go wrong here.  Sound effects are great as well as the music.  Again, you're not going wrong.  The only thing I can say is that if you don't like Rap, you may not like the soundtrack as much. In this case it's good that you can take advantage of the custom soundtrack that the XBOX allows you to give the game. Gameplay is probably where te game begins to faulter.  The game has a "Good Cop/Bad Cop" system which isn't a bad idea.  Should you do things the way a cop in real life would (i.e. you don't kill those you capture, you only injure, you fire warning shots and only shoot people in the leg and such) then you'll be considered a "Good Cop".  Do the complete opposite and you're a "Bad Cop."  There is a meter that tells you on which side of the bar you fall on. Good Cop/Bad Cop isn't too badly done, but it really brings down the difficulty level of this game.  It's fun to drive around but the game is so simple to keep to one side.  If you see someone rob a bank you can easily just hit them with your car and not kill them, which results in you being a "Good Cop".  If you hit him and kill him, you're a "Bad Cop".  This becomes simple gameplay should you approach it that way. What also makes gameplay simple is that you can choose to redo any failed missions.  Clearly you could try them over and over again until the game is done with.  BUT you could continue and leave mission failed. If you do this it effects future missions. Missions are very realistic.  You can go undercover and hope you don't blow it even.  You can do various things that a cop would do. You can search them and see if you find drugs, weapons, etc. or you could flash your badge, which will result in a suspect running or something else. What's not to like about the gameplay? Well, it's too simple for one thing.  I already talked about how you could hit a suspect with a car and not kill them, and this finishes missions easily.  The other part is that you could easily complete missions without shooting (just knock them out).  The auto-aim is very nice however. The other bad thing about the gamplay are those camera angles.  You'll find yourself constantly repositioning the camera just to see some of the action.  Because of the camera you could be "jumped" and never know who did it, or get shot from behind. The game presents a branching story.  The outcome depends on the missions you succeed in and whether or not you're a "Good Cop" or a "Bad Cop".  There are tons of ways to go through the story but the final confrontation is the same.  You "could" become a bad guy but it makes no difference. The story is actually more like something you'd see in an action movie.  You've got your average jerky character (Nick Kang) who doesn't want a partner and constantly refuses to work with his and goes at it alone.  His father used to be a part of the LAPD but died working a case. Sound familiar? It should, and it's full of chase scenes, one liners, and everything else you could want in an action movie. So while larger than Vice City by A LOT the game is actually fairly linear.  The storyline is decent (although the main character takes a bit of time to like), the gameplay is nice and overall the game is pretty good. The Good: +Great graphics and sound! +Though quite linear, TONS of missions +Lots of weapons to choose from +Branching story +Multiple endings +HUGE City to explore The Bad -Main character is unlikeable at first -Annoying Camera Angles -Missions are too simple The game overall is pretty decent. You've got a lot of freedom to enjoy and a huge map to explore.  A great experience.	1
I realize mine is not a popular opinion, but I think the Silent Hill series is the weakest of the more popular survival horror games.  I love all the Fatal Frame games, and most of the Clocktower and Resident Evil games, but something about Silent Hill, to me, was a promise unkept.  It was rich in atmosphere and very little else.  Quite a bit of pounding these mutant creatures to a pulp with a plank too.  Sure, there are clues and inventory and you need to work out a story, but it all seemed so secondary to the "chilly atmosphere" generated, which eventually wore off.  In my opinion it lacks substance.	-1
i had to make sure i was reviewing the right silent hill because i can't believe how much people like this game.  i did like the first silent hill on playstation, years ago.  then i tried silent hill 3 for PC and the camera system was so awful i just couldn't stand it.  so i gave this one a try and it's just... boring!  you walk around, see some monsters, kill them.. blah..  shooting them isn't very fun.  gee, if i want to kill monsters, why wouldn't i just go play doom 3?  it's dark.  it's scary.  it uses guns in a far better manner.  so that means the only reason to play silent hill is to learn the story?  then why not just go read a good book or watch a movie?  or maybe walking around a town is fun.. but hey, i can put on my sneakers and walk around town!	-1
hey i nevr played this but roomers told me that the first one was better on evry system and some stuff wasent good!! figures it's ps2 tipical ps2 when will they ever learn x-box is better redemmer on x-box is way better sorry if i spelled the name wrong! people said it was short soo i know thats it's better then way ward every one at my gamestop said that and so did my magazines my magzines gave a like a 8.25 out of ten and way ward like 6.75 out of ten haaa ha  lol!! thats funny stuff and they said the graphics weren't  as good! SO GET REDEMMER ON THE X-BOX IT'S MORE MONEY CAUSE IT'S BETTER PLUS THERES A HOT GIRL ON THE COVER IT'S ALOT BETTER THEN THIS SURE IT MAY BE SHORT BUT THE FIRST WON WAS TOO LONG AND TOO HARD IF U SAVE WITH ONE LIFE U KEEP THAT NEXT TIME U LOAD THE GAME AND IF U PLAY TWO PLAYER CO .OP MISSION MODE U SHARE THE LIVES TOO HARD AND TOO LONG I GOT RID  OF IT TODAY CAUSE I STOPED PLAYING IT! I ALWAYS FORGET ABOUT HUNTER REDMMER AND WAY WARD FOR SOME RESON WHEN IM AT THE STORE THEY JUST SLIP YM MIND BUT IF I COULNDT FIND A GAME AND I HAD 50 BUCKS REDEMMER IS WAY WORTH IT NOT WAY WARD CONTROLS SUCK ON WAY WARD TOO I HEARD THE ONLY THING WAY WARD HAS THATS BETTER THEN REDEMMER IS THE TITLE NAME IT'S EASER TO SPELL AND SAY BUT THATS IT FOLKS! I GIVE THIS TWO STARS CAUSE IT SUCKS! V1 NAA FOR LIFE!	-1
Not a great game at all.  It was fun for a few levels, then became frustrating.  Maybe a more experienced gamer may like it, but it wasn't for me.	-1
had to get another one,it didn't play	-1
It's a fun game. Wee, woohoo, yippee! You learn to fly the planes with the greatest of ease, and zip through the storyline. The graphics are great! Sometimes you have to replay a part 2 or 3 times to get past it. It's challenging! But then, you get to a part in the story called Soloho's Challenges (go on, google it). That is where the game ends for most people. Because suddenly, your are required to have a skill level that is totally out of line with the rest of the game - sorta like "catch this peanut, catch this peanut, STOP THESE BULLETS WITH YOUR TEETH!". After 40, 50, 60 tries, you take the disk out of the xbox, and throw it away. It'll make you angry. You will never finish it. Or if you do finish it, you'll never get that  40 hours of your life back...  It's explain why such a highly rated game ended up in the $5 and under bin.  I loved it right up to the moment I hated it. And then I hated it enough to pitch out. I'm not sadistic enough to trade this piece of junk in... If you must play it, try to borrow it. Most people who own it will say "keep it".	-1
got this because we (two family members, two friends and myself) wanted a 6 player risk game without setting up all those freakin' pieces on a board. the PS1 version only lets 4 human players and 2 computer players in on a game but we LOVE IT even though when were all together, someone has to sit out. THIS VERSION OF THE GAME IS AWFUL THOUGH! i spent a half hour trying to save all players names and colors only to finally say to myself "ok the games a bit faulty as far as saving goes. thats a shame". it wouldnt just simply save any more than three names in a six player game. it would just replace one with a new name once a fourth was entered and 'saved'. it even tends to say a player is 'already in this game' when it is clearly not and won't let you put really anything in the player slot after this screw up. but it doesnt end there... its confusing, slow and downright LAME. the only thing that saves it (in some way) is pressing Select for help to figure out what button to press to do what. also, in the ps1 version, it will ask you if you are sure when you press a button/make a decision. this doesnt! you set your battalions and press the O button, SORRY your turn is over.. understood that when it becomes second nature you won't make those mistakes but what if a finger slips or a button is accidentally pressed when passing the controller? another thing that just sucks is the fact that you NEED a second controller when any more than one player is in the game. WHY though? the first controller does EVERYTHING besides one thing.. DEFEND... ok, so that means one controller is being passed to set battalions, attack, check cards, free move, ect.. but you have to pass ANOTHER controller to the person you're attacking just so they can press X to pretty much say "ok you can attack me". REALLY?? its not like the defender can say "no i don't feel like being attacked". the only thing exclusive to the second controller you can do is choose the number of dice to defend with and NOTHING ELSE.. awful... maybe the second controller plays a different role in the other modes but by this time ive already decided not to play this unless the group wants to give it a whirl.. five minutes in, theyll change their minds. i guarantee it.. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!	-1
I had in mind that this game was overly complex before I had bought it but I wanted to see for myself since I am little more patient (I thought) than the average person. I found out very quickly that I had made a mistake purchasing this game since it requires that you give up any sembalance of an actual life in order to devote time to it! I finally got frustrated and simply tossed it in my closet of no return where it will remain with a couple of failed novels and various other attempts at creativity. IN SIMPLE WORDS. THIS GAME BITES!!!!	-1
I bought this game expecting a Ghost Recon type game with better graphics and more options.  I find; however, that it is not much like Ghost Recon at all.  GR requires tremendous patience, and success is largely based on equipping your team properly, and mostly positioning them in strategic locations.  With GR you can move almost anywhere you want, and attack targets from any angle.  In Ghost Recon you can control any player, but in RB63 you are stuck with Domingo Chavez. I find that RB63 is more of a shoot e'm up type.  Enemies appear seemingly out of nowhere, and you have to shoot quickly.  The choices of where to go in this game are much more limited, you pretty much just follow down the assembly line and shoot who pops up.  In Ghost Recon one enemy bullet can often kill you, but RB63 is more of a health meter type game. As for the graphics, I was sorely disappointed.  Neither enemies nor your team look very real, and they all move with a skittish, too-fast shamble that looks really odd.  Play Ghost Recon, look through your rifle scope, and study the detail on your fellow soldiers.  You will see camo patterns, triggers, boot laces, CamelBak, etc.  Try that on RB63 and you will see a black, shifting mass with a play-doh face. I do like the huge weapon selection, and is something I wish Ghost Recon had more of. My final summation.  Maybe it is a fun game, but it's not what I was hoping for.	-1
I've played the original SNES Lufia I and II, they were fun and entertaining. This game is a bit monotonaous. basically you go around and train, fight a boss. The plot is weak and the game grows boring after a while. I bought the game because I was going on a trip and needed somehting to do. I got bored with it 1/3 or the way though. I'm a die-hard RPG fan so this one is just plain disapointing	-1
I don't reccommend this game to anyone.  There is nothing fun about it or intresting.  You can hit one button over and over and win.  Not to mention that during Marlyin Mansons fight match he comes up through a devil worshipping symbol- that alone made my choice for me that I wasted my money.  Their is much better games out there to play than this one!	-1
I am an adult gamer and I have no idea how a young child is expected to be able to play this game. Some parts are so easy, you can finish within about 2 minutes and then other parts will have you pulling your hair out. I wouldn't buy it again.	-1
Bought this for $0.01 Not really a good game. Its aged badly and it wasn't good to begin with. I mean its ok and this is coming from a DBZ fan. But its not a great game. Id give it a 35/100	-1
i love the series but i hate the game. this is no better than either a collectors item or a drink coaster. its also worth mentioning that this was released to america during the ps2 era which is baffling, and also advertises budokai 1 for the ps2 on the booklet. i suggest that game over this one	-1
I don't even know why I got this game in the first place.  I mean, come on, Funamation knew this was a horrible attempt at a fighter video game.  There's a good selection of characters, but the game is easy to win (simply stand far away and blast away with special energy attacks).  Also, music and sounds are horrible.  There was literally no voice translations, only title translations.  For DBZ fans out there, go buy a PS2 and get Budokai 3.  You'll be spending about $180 more than if you've bought UB22, but you'll surely be happy.	-1
Sorry fellas. I'm a EXTEMELY hardcore DBZ fan. I can't believe i don't appreciate the game. The only times i play this is if i got like 2 mins if im waitn on som1. Ill start this up. Play it for the mins and they shut it off until im so desperate to play it again. The only reason this has 2 stars is because of all the characters. It was fun to actually use kid trunks/ goten / the hidden Pan / Supreme Kai. And all the other characters that weren't included with Budokai. One of the worst things about this game are the ki beams. They are a little tiny energy ball. Even When i unlocked the secret Super Hyper Spirit Bomb (I think they could have left out the hyper). THe super Hyper Spirit bomb usually killed one hit. But the big bad Super Hyper Spirit bomb was still a small little orange energy ball. Another bad thing, i know it isn't that big a deal but it was just hard to get used to the voices. They weren't from the english shows. They used the japenese voices. It just felt weird to here goku talk and sound like kid gohan from the show. Another bad thing is when i unlocked the ultimate SSJ15 thing for Gohan was that i had to press like  XXOO R1 R2 > < > < ^  square square. I had to do that in like 3 seconds. Just doing it one time gives u a blister. And i think they could have been more creative with that SSJ15 thing. I mean. Gohan just looked like a normal Super Saiyan..Also when i unlocked SSJ3 Vegito. He was called SSJ3 Super Vegito but he looked normal. When he transformed into SSJ3(There was no ssj1 or 2 for him) his hair turned red. What is up with that?! Graphics 2/5 Control  1/5  Err what was the kameamea? x x o r1 l2 l1 r2 in 2 secs? Sound 1/5  Errr i cant member. if there was music i tuned it out. Voices stunk. Characters 5/5  Oh yeah. I love gotenks ahwahwhhaha Total for this game on a scale of 10  3/10  took me a long time to decide between 3  and 2. Dont buy this unless you are a dbz psycho that steals cable TV just for dbz.	-1
ce jeu est trop repetitif , tout le monde sur xbox live prennent la meme auto et c est repetitif. considerant qu il y a pleins de jeu d autos et pour moins cher je n acheterais pas ce jeu. les graphiques sont pas mieux que d autres dans mc2. j aime pas ce jeu car c est tres noir et on vois pas ou on s en va et tout le monde use les cheat code. je ne le recommande pas.	-1
i don't play any computer games but i thought this game would have been the bomb on the box, because it recieved such great reviews for the pc. hmmm!, i was completely wrong. this game is really hard and i don't think that the xbox controller makes the situation any better. i think that strategy and puzzle type games are better for the pc because you can at least use a mouse to aide your playing. if the xbox had a mouse available for some of the games i think that this would have been a really sweet idea for the xbox, but since the controller has enough flaws as it is, i think this was a bad decision. sorry RCT, shoulda' stayed on just the pc!, i only give this game two stars on the xbox for effort.	-1
Stay away from this game. I loved RCT when it came out for the PC, and was looking forward for the Xbox version. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PORT! The graphics are a joke, three generations behind -- approaching Atari 2600. Playing the game with a thumbstick is also very difficult.  This is a shame . . . an awful shame . . .	-1
I'm a big fan of theme park simulations, and these can be fun even on consoles.  I have played Theme park Roller Coaster for Ps2, Jurrassic Park: Operation Genesis, and this game.  This game, which includes the 1998 PC game is the most detailed park game on a console.  However, the graphics just aren't up to date, and it is especially frustrating to manuver the camera to see what is going on in certain angles. Also the controls are rough to use, because there is no keyboard.  Between the squinting and the tough controls, this game just isn't much fun.  I did not have these problems with graphics and controls with the other two console theme park games.  Theme park roller coaster, in particular was fun and had an easy to use interface.  Unfortunately, that game was easy and kind of limited.  I'd probably recommend Jurrassic Park: Operation Genesis among existing console theme park games, although that game is also easy.  Maybe we can hope for Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 to be ported to Xbox.	-1
It not fair for me because I don't have an Xbox and when my pc version plays it restarts my computer. Come on Atari make Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 for 5 systems. PC, XBOX, Gamecube, PS2, and I'll even settle for GBA if I'm that desperate. I only want this because my computer doesn't like me and never lets me play my games.	-1
no game case	-1
I'll admit that this game is surprisingly deep. Many characters, a somewhat decent story line, unlockables. Its a clean and smart fighter through and through. But its repetition and stingy controls bite me every time. Well deserved for a 3D on rails fighter, but not for everyone.	-1
Soul Calibur II for Game Cube is a button-mashing fighting game that is adored by non-gamers and despised by gamers.  The story mode is the worst story mode of any fighter, in which you fight the same characters over and over across a long map of dungeons and areas.  It is more busywork than it is fun.  The moves are executed through button-mashing, with the exception of a few throws that each character has.  Only my non-gamer friends like to play this game as it only involves button-mashing and not actual skill.  I let them beat me at this game whenever I have parties and invite them over because to win at this game would mean I have to play this game with my entire group of non-gaming friends.  Of course, I can win because my hand is something like 100 times faster than their hands or more and I, thus, can button-mash much faster than them, clobbering their characters one by one until my arms and hands are buffed out with my veins popping out.  Plus, I enjoy seeing their astonished faces when they beat me because they know that I am an actual gamer.  It is glorious in that they feel like that they can accomplish anything now since they accomplished such an incredible feat in beating me.  My true gamer friends despise this game.  All in all, Link is well-designed in 3D and can whoop any other character's butt, especially after he gets the fairy sword; however, that's not enough to keep the game interesting for gamers but non-gamers seem to adore it.	-1
I'm not a huge fighting game fan, but at first i thought this game was fun.  with multiplayer simply mashing buttons faster, rather that any form of actual technique, will always guarantee a win.  The other issue is simply that there is no AI. At the beginning of the single player arcade style games, the computer opponents just sit there until you knock them out which is about as exciting as staring at the wall. After beating a few dozen rounds the computer opponent improves a little, but then immediately after a few improved rounds, the computer opponents suddenly can move faster than you or anyone else can ever mash a button.  You can actually watch legs, weapons, and entire bodies of your player model passing through the computer opponents as you strike(no damage is caused of course, the same is not true of the computer opponent passing through the players character), the computer opponent can block at all times even while striking (the player can only strike or block, not both and there is a transition time between them), and the computer opponent can charge up all weapons in roughly one half the time the player can, and surprise! the computer opponent does between 10x-20x the damage the player can even with the computer doing the lamest misfiring hits. It appears they favored static scripts with very simply conditions to make the computer opponent succeed or fail, including outright cheating. Sad. So unless you're playing other people you're wasting your time and money.  Oh and i forgot to mention, the single player 'weaponmaster' mode (called so because it's certainly not story mode) is so boring and contrived that i honestly can not believe it's there. Par for the course...  Fortunately I don't have to worry about accidentally buying another product from the company that made soul caliber, they don't make anything else...	-1
So dissappointed!!!   I cannot believe that this version of THIS game would actually be worse than the Xbox Version! The graphics are absolutely horrible, worse than Dead Or Alive, worse than the other Soul Caliburs, worse than the Tekkens, worse than the Virtua Fighters, and worse than the Bloody Roar!   Gameplay is terrible. The characters have to move so slow in this version.   Namco did make a good choice for the special guest star, Link, and that is why this game is worth the one star. It dies not deserve anymore stars.	-1
This game is fine....Except for it sucks!! It takes no skill whatsoever. A no skill no talent moron could play this game and pretend their good at it. Whoever plays this game and enjoys it is an absolute idiot. This game is nothing compared to hardcore fighters like tekken, street fighter and even king of fighters. When it comes to any aspect of this game it sucks. I must admit the idea of weapons is alright but to make that the key aspect of the game you would think it would be a bit more complicated then just pressing buttons randomly. I swear anyone could win in that game by pressing random buttons. Again a no talent no skill game. Just another example of how much Soul Calibur sucks!!	-1
The best part was some of the "Extra" challenges in this game. The rest of the game unfortunately was awful. The cutscenes and some of the gameplay graphics aren't all that great. Some of the story missions can be fun, but for the most part kind of boring or way too hard. And in the case with the Bruce missions, just down-right annoying.  I wouldn't recommend this game at all. In fact, there's another Hulk game out there that really lives up to what a Hulk game should be, and it's NOT based on the recent movie: "Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction." Almost fully destructive environments, more unlockable Hulk abilities, and not only that but it's fun to play. Just roam around destroying things and increasing your abilities/combos.	-1
This game honestly sucked like the movie, if you liked the movie then buy this but the graphics is bad and the gameplay is fake.	-1
Soul Calibur II is an excellent game, but the Xbox Version, I daresay, is terrible. The special guest, Spawn, is a horrible fighter. Namco could have done better to pick a better guest star for the Xbox.   The graphics is way better then that off the Virtua Fighters, the Tekkens, and the Bloody Roar Series, but that is the only good part, and thats why it is worth one star.	-1

i tried to run this game said media disc so it would not work, lesson i learned in gaming Xbox original games will not work on Xbox 360 slim console.	-1
Broke in the mail thin cases. Was refunded store credit. Don't recommend buying games used if you do its a risk.	-1
Midnight Club 2 has decent graphics if you have the hardware, but it's a complete failure as a racing game.  All of your computer opponents fly past you even on straight stretches with the throttle maxed.  The damage to your car and others is completely unrealistic, and there's no difference in the way any of these cars drive and handle.  I was disappointed with the driving physics in EA's NFS Hot Pursuit, but this game makes it look like a racing simulation in comparison.  It's not even good enough to be considered an arcade racer as the keyboard controls are overly sensitive and there's no way to adjust the settings. The PS2 version got a lot of positive reviews, but something was lost in the translation to the PC.  If you're looking for a racing game with good graphics and driving physics, NFS Porsche Unleashed is the one to beat.  This game doesn't come close.	-1

Buyer beware.  This game is advertised as "Works great on Xbox 360" on the packaging, which we thought meant it was updated to actually work on the X360.  But No. It does NOT work great on Xbox 360.  Yes, it technically opens and runs using the original xbox emulator built-in to the x360 (which REQUIRES a hard drive installed in your x360 if you didn't know).  But Misleadingly, this game still uses the old original (discontinued) Xbox Live, and thus no online multiplayer at all whatsoever?!  Come to find this out the hard way; 1. Microsoft Xbox Live is the OLD discontinued online mulitplayer from original Xbox that is offline forever. 2. Microsoft Xbox Live Gold is the CURRENT online multiplayer network for Xbox 360 and Xbox One.  NOTE: To confirm, even logged into the X360 with active Xbox Live Gold account, this game gives a error about being unable to connect online to Xbox Live (even though all our other Xbox Live games work great online).  After looking up the error code online, we discovered if we had an old Original Xbox hardware, this game STILL WOULD NOT WORK ONLINE AT ALL WHATSOEVER.  Bottom line:  No online multi-player whatsoever means in our humble opinion, "Work great on Xbox 360" as advertised on the packaging is not 100% truthful, and in fact, we outright feel tricked by this misleading game packaging's marketing.  Buyer beware.	-1

I was one of the many that pre-ordered halo 2 because I enjoyed the first one so much. About me and seven of my friends bought it at the midnight release and went to my buddies house where we played it all night and my friend and I beat the co-op storyline around 8 or 9 the next morning. There were some things I liked and hated about the game.  Storyline: If you played the first one the storyline is lacking and really straightforward. You play the "hero", fight against aliens and save humanity/earth whatever. For the second one when they released video clips it made it sound as if the aliens found earth and are attacking it and you (master chief) were turning earth into a crazy urban war between humans and aliens. Its been a long time since I played the storyline, actually the night of its release was the last time, but you only end up fighting on earth for the first one or two levels (I use the term lightly as halo has no "real" levels). Then you end up going into one of the alien ships or something like that. You also get to play as one of the aliens, which I found to be rather fun but also a "played" story gimmick as this has happened in other games as well. The ending was very dissapointing as it just left you hanging and wanting more and hoping there was actually more to the story left. Bungie could have done a better job and made the story more developed and the game a bit longer.  Graphics: I've read a lot of reviews saying that the graphics are awesome but I didn't see a great deal of difference between halo and halo 2. However, I also didn't play either game with HD cables on an HDTV. They used the same engine and just added what seemed to me a polishing effect to the "levels" and characters.  Sound: I love the music to halo and I was happy to hear the music back in Halo 2. Also the human and alien voices are fun to hear. The multiplayer firefights and single player firefights are wonderfully done as it helps to make you feel like you're actually there in the game.  Weapons: I was dissapointed in the weapon selection as there seemed to be no imagination to what they did with them. Humans have a sniper rifle so lets give aliens a sniper rifle. Humans have rocket launchers (the rocket launcher now targets and follows enemy vehicles-nice!) so aliens need a rocket launcher. The plasma rifle was given an unneeded change as it no longer froze your enemies in place to circle around them and hit them in the back, which made the rifle now another useless weapon in your arsenal. I enjoyed the sword in single player but in multiplayer was a very frustrating weapon to fight against. In single player the sword ran out of charge after so many hits but in multiplayer it lasted the whole game which was a very annoying thing. If you've ever played halo 2 multiplayer you know what I'm talking about. The pistol was toned way down but with few updates they gave it some power back but was nowhere near the "horror" like the first. Grenades were the most and saddest thing they changed in the game. I loved grenades in the first one and ended up using them more than anything in the game. So when I played halo 2 the first time I couldn't wait to throw my first grenade and when I did I literally freaked out. Master Chief "dropped" the grenade right in front of me and when the explosion happened I was still alive??? They turned Master Chief's powerful throwing into a "toss" or "drop" and the explosion of the grenade......well lets just say I might as well have been throwing waterballoons at the aliens with the damage that one of those did. The last thing they did was duel-wield which was a nice feature but the balance of duel-wield and other weapons was crap. The duel thing could've been left out and was a much over-hyped feature.  Vehicles: Like I said with imagination- Bungie seemed to be lacking in that department. Humans have a tank and a warthog so lets give the covenant a tank and warthog. I know, I know the covenant tank was in the first one but could you drive it?? Nope. I liked the fact that vehicles now could be blown up and that you could kick people out of the vehicle and take it or if you were crazy like me you could jump in a warthog with an opposing team driving it, thats always fun. I do wish they would have given you the option to turn vehicle damage on or off. In multiplayer you would destroy the warthog and a few minutes later they would have a brand new one waiting for them, so that was annoying too. The last thing they changed that I didn't like was I couldn't run over people anymore, well you can but its a 1 in 6 shot that you'll actually do it.  Physics Engine: I hate the physics in halo 2, one thing that made the original halo so fun was playing "warthog basketball" in blood gulch or blowing up a ghost over the middle of sidewinder and watching it fly.  Multiplayer: Multiplayer is chaotic and can be fun but 70% of the time if you're not playing with a friend it is frustrating to hear people cussing you out, making really annoying background sounds etc. The addition of "team chat" only would've been really nice. Most of the upgrades they did to the multiplayer levels were nice and done really well, the name changes weren't really necessary though. I liked the setup for the xbl matching, I just wish that the players had more control over what levels, weapons, radar and such would go on during the game instead of the pre-made matches (that counted to your ranking) that you ended up playing over and over and over and over again. Also the hacking and modded xbox's that you would play sucked too, that was neither bungie's nor microsoft's fault, but did hinder the fun of the multiplayer experience.  Vision change: For the longes time I couldn't figure out why halo 2 seemed visually different than halo 1. One day, it hit me, I was playing multiplayer and was running around getting p'wned as I usually did in halo 2 and I realized the levels were closer to me than in the first one. I realized the developers went for a tunnel vision view instead of the periphial expanded look as in the previous one. In halo when I walked around, I had a periphial view and the levels looked so much larger and massive. In halo 2, however, they give you a more narrow view and make everything seem closer for a more "unreal" look, by unreal I mean like the unreal series.  Single player exploration: This is one of the things that made the original halo so awesome. My friends and I would spend countless hours in the single player mode going to areas we really weren't supposed to go and do things that were absolutely fun and crazy. You could actually get online and see things people would do and it made it all the more entertaining. In halo 2 they "controlled" the areas that you were not supposed to get to by putting skulls or I think in one level there was a huge ball or something. That made me lose the appeal to actually go and explore the level like I did in the first one. Now the developers want me to go find these "hidden" places that I wasn't supposed to......puh-lease!!  So to sum it all up, the cons seemed to outweigh the pros for me as an avid Halo 1 fan. The lack of vehicle and weapon imagination, physics engine change, tunnel vision with the short and dissapointing ending storyline made the rush of halo 2's release makes Halo 2 an average to below average first person shooter experience. Halo 2's multiplayer is fun with friends and the added detail in the levels makes it more tactical and visual treat. If you're looking for a game that has a good story and imagination this is NOT the game for you but if you just wanna play a fun shooter with some friends its not to bad of a game.  It only gets 2 stars from this dissapointed halo fan.....	-1
This game is a matter of comparison. It's SP, compared with its predecessor, is complete garbage. You get about two levels in, and you start to wonder why you are still holding the controller. If you want to keep up with the story, then play the SP game, and pay close attention, as it is rather complex. If you don't plan to get H3 and finish out the story line, then you probably won't have the patience to finish the game.  As for the MP, it is better than the first one. Which is not to say it is good, as the balance factor is terrible (battle rifle, plasma pistol, rocket launcher, and sniper rifle - thats it, the only worthwhile guns in the game, roughly in order of importance). The only more unbalanced online shooter I have played in recent memory was . . . well . . . Halo 1.  Overall, it is only valuable as a segue between Halos 1&3. Otherwise, avoid it, its not worth the time.	-1
The Legendary level is way much harder than Halo 1.  The game is also boring I quit playing after a couple hours.	-1
Everything that was great about the first Masterpiece of HALO is DESTROYED in this game, it has lost all of its creativity and should have never been released.  It has hard hard controls, basically redicouslously dark places, and its just highly over rated. DO NOT GET IT, this game sucks!. The only things good about it are - Being the Covenant, and having better graphics.	-1
Of course, the multiplayer is phenomenal with this game if you are lucky enough to have the online service hooked up.  Otherwise, I felt that this game was not stacking up to the fist.  The graphics got a major overhaul and look better than Halo1, but Halo2 lacks all of the huge and epic major battles that we saw in Halo1.  This game would have done fine if it was just another shooter, but it surely does not offer something comparable to the original. You play as a covenant and can wield the cool sword.  The game is fun, but the dissapointment of not meeting the expectations for me from the first game left me no choice than to view this game as just another shooter.  Ive played the first game with a friend cooperatively on each difficutly setting all the way through and every time I am blown away by how action packed, exciting, and hair raisingly edge of your seat challenging the very end of the game was when you have to make your final escape.  Halo2 had a very easy, cliche, and unmotivated boss battle with an ape with a hammer.  I guess everything is explained in the special edition DVD in which the developers explain that they either had to cut tons of content for time or money purposes.  This game maybe was a little rushed.  It gets -2 stars for being like just any other shooter out there and another -1 for leaving me wantng to play the original more.	-1
Next to "Fable", this game was THE DISAPPOINTMENT of last year.  Go back into a few video game magazine archives and look at what these guys promised us, but didn't even come close to delivering on.  The game is so terribly flawed and mundane, that it makes the first one look even better than ever.  And to make matters worse, they went all Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear) on us, and made us play as one of the Covenant.  This is the second dumbest idea in video game history---next to of course, Kojima making us play as "Not Solid Snake".  The multiplayer is cool for about ten hours, but after awhile you'll be longing for the comfort-zone provided by the original "Halo", and if you're like me, you may weep at the thought of what this game could and should have been.  A painfully average game at-best...but definately not "Halo".  2.5 Overall.  3 for fun ONLY because of the multiplayer modes.	-1
Halo 2, the sequel to Bungie's much hyped Halo, is here, and it's being hyped! But I will be true, so I didn't like this game. (There, I said it! Hate me, fanboys!)  Here's why.....  On the + side:  1. Great multiplayer  If you have Xbox Live, you'll love this game.  2. Great sound  The music and sound effects are perfect!  On the - side:  1. Bad graphics  I bet you're ready to slap me, but they aren't really that impressive... and during cut-scenes, they often glitch.  2. Bad gameplay  "Dual-Wielding" is a rip-off that you will never use, due to not being able to throw grenades. There is also a major imbalance in difficulty. Easy and Normal are Pathetically easy. Heroic and Legendary are mind-bendingly difficult.  3. Really Bad story  I'm ready to cry. I fought through wave after wave of covenant and flood and all I get is a cliffhanger ending for my troubles. Come on, Bungie. The game was short enough- you could've easily ended the story and moved on to a new series. This is all a plan to make me buy the Xbox 360, isn't it?  Overall, while Halo 2 has great multiplayer, it fails at delivering a decent single-player experience... but it does do what Bill Gates planned. (Xbox 360 will suceed)	-1
i don't have this game but my freind sed it was bad so i don't like it	-1
I like the ocasinal shooter game. Halo 2 is one shooter game for me is not fun. I didn't enjoy this game as much as I would of. The graphics are amazing but the controls were too hard. If you like the first halo get this game. But I'll get Day of Reckoning.	-1
I'm a huge fan of the first Halo which I bought over a year ago for my computer and I STILL play online on a weekly basis. Sure, the story and structure of the campaign itself are lifted from the original Half Life, but as Picasso once said, "Good artists borrow, great artists steal." And while Halo's Campaign was great, the Multiplayer was even better.  So when Halo 2 came out, I willingly fell into Microsoft's monopoly trap and bought an Xbox figuring the year it would take for it to come out on my computer would be unbearable. Boy what a disappointment. Here's why...  REASON #1: THE CURSE OF THE VAPID SEQUEL  Halo 2 campaign offers nothing new in terms of plot. Just a rehash of the same battles with the Covenant Aliens and some Flood zombies who seem a bit superfluous to the convoluted story-line. Sure you can now hold two weapons instead of just one, and you spend half the game as a covenant alien. But these are really superficial gimmicks. There was nothing substantially different or new to this game.  REASON # 2: MICRO$HAFT  First off, I had no idea Microsoft would actually have the nerve to charge me 10 dollars a month in order to play online. There isn't one PC game that charges me to play online. Why? Because I already pay my cable company for that! So why would Microsoft charge me for a service they don't even provide? Have you read the papers? That's what Microsoft is best at. Charging you for whatever they want because if you don't like it, and want to go somewhere else, you can't. Because they have so much capitol from previous monopolies, they can buy out an entire company for just one single game and only release that game for their own consoles. Which leads to my third disappointment with Halo 2...  Reason #3: MICROSOFT MEDIOCRITY  Bungie designed the interface of the first Halo and it's simple and intuitive. Wanna play online? Hit MULTIPLAYER and then hit SEARCH. Boom! A list of games going on all over the world appear on your screen, listed by server name, game map, game type (capture the flag, slayer, etc), number of players allowed, number of player slots available and server ping speed.  In Halo 2, designed by the counter-intuitive geniuses at Microsoft this time rather than Bungie, you can't choose your map, you can't choose your server, or even your specific game type. They choose for you. Sound familiar?  And the final reason I am disappointed by Halo 2, it's trite, but I'm passionate about it. Whether I have a head set or not, I am forced to listen to all the stupid, racist, sexist, childish, moronic comments the rest of the world decides to blurt from their ADD-inflicted mouths through my speaker system.  At least in Halo 1, all the neo-nazi crap came in the form of text messaging which was easy to ignore as it was fast flying in the corner of your screen. But you can't block out voices without losing all your sound.  Sorry guys, some of you might love this new version of Halo, but I'm going back to play Half Life 2 again, a sequel equal to the original. Let's just hope Microsoft doesn't buy out Sierra anytime soon.	-1
Maybe I just don't enjoy FPS's like I used to. Maybe I expected too much. Perhaps games of yesterday that I grew up on (Diablo 2, MGS, and Rainbow Six even) spoiled me. Or perhaps I'm the only brave soul to offer a counterpoint to the masses' blinded eyes.  I really dislike Halo 2.  Come on, admit it. If there was no media hype, no one to talk with it about, and you played it by yourself with an open mind, you would wonder after an hour what you're doing too. If you played good games like the old ones I mentioned or Burnout 3, MK Deception, and Return to Castle Wolfenstein even (reinventing an old school classic, feller) maybe you'd see the light. Halo is nothing more than another Quake 2, another Half-Life 1. Games that supposedly reinvented Doom 1's formula, and made games mass market items. HA. I laugh at all you for wasting your money on these games, and ask you to pity me wasting fifty bucks on what was supposed to be "the best game ever". Never will I succumb to blinded critics again. Never! You all probably watched Titanic ten times too, and drool over Desperate Housewives and Extreme Makeover Home Edition. Not me, buddy. I judge things how I see em, not how the mass voice of media does.  So for all you like me, straight seers, I recommend rethinking what games you buy. I realize this review will be assaulted by Halo lovers, but I only wish to offer a different view. My view.  Peace out.	-1
HALO 2, perhaps the most over hyped sequel of all time.  The game fails to deliver on anywhere near the level the first HALO did.  Sure, it adds a few nice features but it takes away far more and some of the old bugs are still there.  Items can still slide under others and mysteriously vanish. Marines now sometimes vanish even in mid combat, and not by being destroyed.  There is a far shorter campaign game than before.  There are a lot more times where you just sit and watch an uninteruptable cut scene.  Some weapons have minor improvements. The Battle Rifle is arguably superior to that Assault Rifle due to the scope and the small burst fire, but for serious action it is deficient to even the old AR.  The pistol has had it's scope removed and is weaker than before, as is the shotgun, and with lower ammo capacity as well.  The rocket launcher has a virtually useless tracking feature which turns so poorly it only makes things worse.  Dual weapons can be marginally fun but you lose the use of grenades, which are still ridiculously limited to 4 of each type as if your suit had special pockets for each type or something lame like that.  Vehicles are nice in a way now that they are all destroyable but they took away the damage indicator so you now have to guess from the appearance, which you rarely see well enough.  To sum up, the game seems more like an advertisement for HALO 3 or XBOX live than anything else.	-1
Let me summarize this game for you: its repetitive! It gets old!  You will run around in circles for hours and hours trying to kill each other. Around, around, around, and around. If that rocks your boat (like it does thousands of xbox gamers) then feel free to buy this. Where is the substance?  One other point, I am tired of hearing people refer to other games as "this is a halo rip off.... this is a halo rip off...." Guess what? Halo is an "UNREAL rip off" it stole every concept it has from unreal tournament. SO put that in you pipes and smoke it.  I gave it an extra star for the graphics....if you MUST have this type of game, Id wait for doom III. At least it's a gory adventure game, besides a FPS	-1
I loved Halo. From the moment I picked it up it "spoke" to me like no other game ever has. And, I've been playing video games since pong. For 2+ years me and my friends would spend EVERY weekend playing online using XBC. Even with all that game play, it never got boring for us. Normaly, when I play a game and beat it, it then goes to the shelf to sit next to the rest of the games to collect dust. Even games that are fun to play online have never kept my attention for more than a couple of months.  So, when I tried out Halo 2, I was vastly dissapointed. I felt like I was playing another sega of the Unreal franchise. Master Chief has new low gravity jumps. Multiplayer now has gravity pads. You no longer take damage when falling from up high. Part of the strategy of Halo multiplayer was using objects to break your fall. The new weapons that I will talk about shortly make for a much faster game with a "spray and pray" feel to it. I thought I was buying Halo. Had I wanted Unreal, I would have just bought Unreal. Part of Halo's charm for me and many others was the fact that it wasn't Unreal or Quake. It was a skill based shooter that stood on it's own.  I had a few problems with the campaign mode. It was very dark compared to Halo. I don't mean sinister, just dark. Not very many bright sunny days in Halo 2. It was rather short. And they did things with the plot that I could have done without. But, even with this said it was alright.  The major problem for me is the multiplayer. The multiplayer is where replayability is a huge factor. When my friends and I played Halo for 2+ years, we didn't sit around playing the campaign over and over. The main problem are the new weapons. They have removed or changed EVERY single weapon in the game. The weapon that made Halo what it was, the pistol, is no longer. This wouldn't have been all that bad, but no good substitute is offered. They said that they did this for "balance". But, when everyone has a pistol, there isn't a balance or overpowered issue. After all, you need some weapons more powerfull, or you might as well just only have one weapon for the whole game. Now they have a sub machine gun as the mainstay. It's a very weak weapon with a very short range. So instead of playing and shooting and having fun, I now have to chase people down to get into range. That, or wait around for a couple of minutes for a decent weapon to spawn. The plasma rifle no longer "freezes" an enemy. The physics of the rocket have changed and the splash damage has been reduced. The grenades have been toned down to being almost worthless. Even the sniper rifle is a little different. There are a couple of new mid ranged weapons, but at mid range you'll be lucky kill your target in a full clip. The new weapons worked fine in multiplayer, but don't translate for multiplayer. By making such a severe change in the weapons, they also made a fundemental change in the game play. It is no longer a mid ranged shooter, it is now a short ranged shooter. This is another reason it gives Halo 2 that Unreal and Quake feel. Halo 2 offers duel wielding where you can use a single hand weapon in both hands. This was a novel idea, and tried with other games before. The problem I have with it is that most of the weapons seemed toned down to force you to use duel wielding. You can't swing a dead cat around without hitting some ammo for a duel wieldable weapon. But any medium range weapons you'll be scrambling to find ammo.  And there are a couple of new vehicles. They are fun, but my problems are in the changes to the vehicles we already had. Now you can board vehicles and they take damage. No more shooting a person out of a warthog as it drives by with your flag with your spawn weapon. Now you pretty much have to blow the whole thing up. GOOD LUCK! And well timed grenades no longer flip them over or stop them. Now you'll just do some damage to it instead as they drive by. And a persons shields are directly involved in when the vehicle is destroyed. You could shoot a rocket launcher at a Wraith tank and wait for the persons shield to recharge. Well, after 40 rocket launcher shots you would think it would be ready to explode, but no. Running someone over in a vehicle is much hard. I have hit people head on and simply bounce them off my vehicle about 100 feet without killing them. Boarding a vehicle is a novel idea, but a good player won't get into range of you.  I could go on, and on, and on. All I have to say to end this is, try it before you buy it. They had 1.5 million pre-order sales on the first day. Not because Halo 2 was good, but because Halo was good. Those 1.5 million people hadn't even tried the game. I too was one of the unlucky. I fell for the hype and thought Bungie would make a quality game worthy of the name Halo. I was wrong.	-1
HALO 2. Yep. The game EVERYONE said would be the best. The game EVERYONE said would revolutionize gaming. It revolutionized it all right. It made FPS's everywhere feel ashamed that ONE game could be so dull. It is NO, and I mean NO different from the first HALO (which also sucked). It has no point WHAT-SO-EVER. Point A to B (like someone on here had said). Oh yeah, FPS's are supposed to be shooting fun, i know, but they need a point to them, BUT NOT THIS GAME!!!! Shoot, reload, shoot some more. Vehicles give it no touch at all. You want a first person shooter, get STARSIEGE TRIBES for PC. If your PC was mad in 1999 or later, your PC can take a game 10 times better the HALO.	-1
After playing the game with my cousin and reading the online reviews I would have to say that this game pretty much sucked the big one.  OMG, Bungie, what the hell are you thinking putting this game out there after we, the buyers, had to wait 2+ yrs to play.  I mean don't get me wrong, the graphics, the voice-over and the weapons were awesome.  But, the ending?  Come on now, I saved up big time to get this and had pre-ordered months in advance to receive the "Game of the Year" please!  The original, Halo, beats this one in to.  Also, I didn't like playing between the Convenant and as Master Chief.  Pick one side and stick with it.  They should make it like this: First play as Master Chief then after beating the game as a human give the option to play as the convenant or maybe...The Flood.  Oh, Bungie, if you're reading this: Make an ending that the gamer will like and not one the blows.	-1
Unless you want some fun for only a week, avoid this disappointing sequel to the truly great game: Halo.  Microsoft has done it again: create a great product and follow it up with no substance. There are 1,000 reasons that this game now stinks and you can find them all over the Internet.  If you are good with Halo, Halo 2 will be sure to disappoint you. If you have never played before, either one will do, but better players are migrating back to the original.	-1
the first time I played it when it was called Turok.  I will never understand the obsession with First Person shooters.  They are all the same and Halo is no different.  Ohhh, you get to drive in a vehicle, been there done that in the 80's and 90's.  Just like Eminem, it's tired folks, move on.	-1
Halo 2 is even worse than Halo 1. Halo 2 is more unrealistic than the first. The vehicles are mainly the same and the guns are a little different. If you didn't like the firt Halo don't buy this because it is even stupider. They should have changed the name because it sounds like a game for girls. The grafics haven't gotten better. If you like realistic shooting games get Conflict Veitnam. It is very realistic and theres 14 missions and over 40 weapons.	-1
You got to be kidding me.  It took 2 years to develop this game when it carries the same basic principles as the first Halo.  Atleast GTA series is different in many aspects as apposed to this boring title.  First off, the game is way to easy.  Hardly any changes in overall game play.  This game is 99% hype and .5% joke and .5% fun.  Second, I've run into graphic and image overlays and significant stutering during game play.  Graphics are improved but still very much similar to Halo 1.  I was able to find this game for 39.99 at a local computer store.  Its not worth it.  Maybe 29.99 or possibly a rental, but certain not for a purchase.  If you look passed the hype, the game is nothing more than Halo 1 packaged as Halo 2.  With this joke, maybe the rumors are true that MS may back out of the gaming environment.......	-1
I just completed the game after somewhere between 8-10 hours of total gameplay over the course of two days. I feel cheated out of 50 dollars. I haven't yet tried the multiplayer aspect of this game (nor Xbox live) but the story mode was not worth it. I recommend this as a weekend rental... The missions are nowhere as interesting or dynamic as they were in the first game. As another review mentioned, much of the levels are "corridor-style", involving fighting in tight quarters which gets old fast. I kept playing expecting something better, but the only thing that came was the credits and the end of the game. Though I haven't played on it, I think this may be an attempt to push Live, because the story mode seems premature.	-1
Must say i played it for a day and never played again. I really didn't understand the storyline of this game, if it has one. Every campaign has only one map and mission. They just put you in a map to gather resources, develop your forces with endless upgrades and destroy the enemy. There is no more objectives in this game. For me this is like playing always in skirmish mode. Age of Empire was better.	-1
I find RON so similar to Microsoft's Age of Kings series game mechanics. If you enjoy Microsoft's approach to RTS then I would recommend you buying RON.  On the other hand, If your tastes are more inclined to Civilization then don't buy RON or you'll find it boring. I've honestly tried playing this game five times and I just cannot bare it. I eventually go back to civIII because I find it much more intelligent and deeper.  In RTS it's not so much about the latest graphics, it's the playability and the challenge that counts. I find the graphics of RON better than those of Civ but it's just not enough I'm afraid.  Drakan	-1
I've never considered myself a real-time strategist. Since Westwood's seminal *Dune II*, I've beaten about every major RTS on the American market. Yet game play hasn't evolved enough to sustain my interest.   Same goes for turned-based strategy, though I've been clicking "Next Turn" since the original *Civilization*. These too, have stuck by the formula with insufficient innovations to maintain replay value.   So when PC journalists began to herald an RTS/TBS revolution last year, I took notice. Developer Big Huge Games and game `zines alike trumpeted a game to bridge the gap between the excitement and mechanics of real-time war games with the scope and sophistication of turned-based empire builders.   Folks, I am still waiting. In the meantime, I received Big Huge Games' *Rise of Nations*; beneath all the hype it's a disappointingly conventional RTS.   From the get-go, it's necessary to sort game from advertisement. Favorable reviewers all around have gushed some variation of the following:   1. *RoN* is a sophisticated RTS.   2. *RoN* is an epic RTS.   3. *RoN* is a hybrid between RTS and TBS game types.   4. *RoN* is a sophisticated, epic hybrid between RTS and TBS types.   While I haven't tested these claims online, my single-player conquests invalidated these claims.   *RoN* rigidly adheres to RTS tradition. Gameplay confines to the B3 principle: Build bases, Build units, Blow up. The developers include a Risk-style "Conquer the World" mode which offers raiding party actions, but otherwise missions are solved by building a base, amassing resources, and then smashing a computer-controlled base with a large, clumsy army. Like most modern RTS games, *RoN* offers rudimentary diplomacy, research, and economic features to upgrade your forces. Likewise, it offers a choice of combatants distinguished mainly by military power and texture skins variations. Finally, *RoN* arrays stereotypical unit types and superfluous gimmicks... like most RTS games, the player will quickly learn that building a bunch of tanks and rushing the enemy base works most of the time.   *RoN* rushes with Blizzard-style play mechanics founded back with the original *Warcraft*. Players use a central building to generate labor units, units who mine a small range of archetypal resources from battlemap hotspots and typically hoof them back to the central building (though *RoN* mercifully permits players to build collection camps on-site). Players then spend these resources by ordering labor units to build factories, laboratories, and fortifications around the central building. Each has its own build queue for military units, and/or unit upgrades as well.   Bases are not sprawling, well-defend affairs as in the Westwood model. Fortifications lack sufficient range and hit points while costing too much to build; discouraging base-camping and encouraging aggressive play. One usually wins by destroying selected enemy buildings. A 200-unit population cap per player constrains their entire infrastructures.   Frankly, I find this game-style dated. That doesn't stop Big Huge Games from trying to adorn their product with trappings of the turned-based empire genre. *RoN* notably introduces a "library" of additional building and unit upgrades. This library also improves caps and modifiers for resources, and improves the next notable introduction, national borders. National borders act strictly as a weapon, by inflicting "attrition" damage on any enemy unit or building caught on the wrong side of a shift. Per *Civilization*, a number of "wonder" buildings unlock special powers and modifications. And the players can advance through levels of technology called "Ages". BHG emulates Stainless Steel Studios in offering peaceful technology or resource races as an endgame option for skirmish and multiplayer modes.   And that's it. Big Huge Games might call its combatants "civilizations", its labor units "citizens", and its bases "cities"; in practice it's still the Blizzard RTS military model. The intricate tech trees of the *Civ* and *MOO* series are here trimmed down to lines of yet more unit upgrades. Borders have no cultural or political purpose-they just act as a force shield. Economy is still a shallow matter of collecting resources and uncovering crates to build powerful armies. Missions are limited mostly to combat, the non-military options being woefully underdeveloped. Yes, *Rise of Nations* is straight RTS, no more sophisticated than *Starcraft* or epic than *Empire Earth*.   With *RoN* put into perspective, I can see its virtues more clearly. It's a fast-paced entry into the "historical" genre, for those who want to upgrade armies from the stone age to modern times in an afternoon. A plethora of civilization-specific units and advantages lends a style choice to whichever side you play. BHG keeps base buildings to a minimum, and players can immediately build all units available for a given age, so long as they have the resources and the factories. Resources are widely available and players have plenty of room on each map to spread their bases and amass armies. BHG also incorporates good unit AI and path-finding. If the player doesn't want to worry about an extended campaign or story-line, *RoN* is all about skirmishes and multiplayer.   Perhaps as much as the hype these traditions fail to please me. I'm tired of the arbitrary 200-unit population caps and mindless B3 routine. Westwood games may be even more dated in their play mechanics, but at least they concentrated each game on a story and well-executed themes, instead of developing a loose collection of skirmish variations beneath a thread-bare claim of being "historical".   BHG could have broke the mold; the idea of a true epic RTS is one of the great unrealized ideas in PC gaming. They played it safe instead-but had the gall to call it something it is not. Make no mistake; dedicated RTS gamers will probably love this game for the same reasons I dislike it. But serious TBS gamers may be disappointed all around. *Rise of Nations* is no real-time *Civilization*; it's as conventional a military RTS as they come. Just don't buy the hype if you buy this game.	-1
Okay, so I'm supposed to build buildings and units.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to walk around and discover rarities that merchants can harvest.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to accumulate wood, food, & gold.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to study in the library AND (and this is the part that bugs me most) in every other building.  AND. I'm also supposed to build an army/navy and deploy them in a micromanaging way.  This game has some great parts - I am not denying that.  However, it is a horribly flawed nightmare.  I loved to micromanage in turn-based strategies.  It is next to impossible to accomplish this in a RTS.  I feel torn between wanting to research, build, gather, and explore.  I defy anyone finding an enjoyable balance.  Rise of Nations would be far supperior if it were turn-based.  As it is, I constantly feel as though I'm neglecting one of my four desires.  Also, it is ridiculous to be required to research advancements in multiple buildings.  It sounds organized at first but it becomes a nightmare when trying to stay on top of technology advances.  Developers should make ONE research interface!  Second, units should not build buildings!  Cities should build buildings!  Do not make me responsible for creating a citizen.  This makes no sense.  Buildings a military unit makes tons of sense, but not normal citizens!!!  I am begging the developers to redesign the city interface to encompass these changes!  These minor changes would make this game fanastic.	-1
The game *looks* nice.  But it's just a click fest like the other hundred games in this genre.  If you enjoy mousing around faster than your opponent, you'll dig it.  If you enjoy more strategy then get Civ III.	-1
Rise of the nations does not suck nor it is a superhit. Starting's ok but then,BORING.It's just one of those stragety games which have gone bum after a few days. The controller is pretty sluggish. The countries are almost the same. There is not even one part in the game where 'oh! It's so exiting' comes to your mind. Warcraft is much better. Beleive me	-1
I love good strategy games, but this doesn't qualify. This is a cheap remake of Empire Earth. The graphics are worse than that of Empire Earth, and the unit movement is very glitchy. Advise to microsoft game development crew; "Start over!!!" Yes, the upgrades are cool, but repetitive. This game held my attention for about 4 hours. Then I got sick of it, and was ready to sell it back.	-1
Poor Design. The World map play is dumb. If you attack (and win) the capitol you get all territories of that country (no matter how big). The battles are the similar to the `Age of Empires' with a few new twists. I was not impressed.	-1
Beware: This program, like many other recent games, will ONLY run properly on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000. That means that in most common home settings, school settings, or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game. If you have configured your home PC, for example, so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them "limited" accounts (a recommended "best practice" you should certainly be following), your kids will not be able to play this game. Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to "user-level" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game. Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Rise of Nations is an excellent game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation. More information on this issue is available. ...	-1
If you are looking for a total dungeon crawl with random battles every ten seconds though endless dungeons that require mind-numbing repetition to finally work you way through, then this is the game for you!	-1
I guess I'm the voice of dissent, but I didn't care for this game at all. Here's what I didn't like about Wario Ware: -> Too easy.  I got through the entire game, including unlocking all the other "games", in two days. -> I was expecting strategic variety in the various "minigames", but almost all of them boil down to hitting a single button at just the right time (hit the "A" button at the height of a jump to sink a basketball shot...or jump off a ski lift, or catch a rod that's dropped into your hand, or catch a piece of toast launched from a toaster, or put a finger up a nose, or slice a bamboo shoot in half, or jump over an oncoming car, etc, etc, etc.) Almost entirely built on "one-shot" reflex timing, and not on strategy, logic, reasoning, skill, or anything else I'd look for in a game (or one of 200 games). The unlocked "games" (as opposed to the minigames) are, predictably, lame...they remind me of mind-numbingly dull space-invader wannabe games circa 1980. I'd say the game was a decent diversion for 2 days, but it feels more like one of those demo disks with a dozen game "previews", except that it costs [money].  If nothing else, the company gets kudos for exploring new ideas and formats.	-1
I bought this to use as a USB headset on PC rather than connect it to my PS2, because all of my othes are either lost or broken. I figured the size and the Logitech name would guarantee a little longevity. I'm not especially rough on my toys, but my gaming area is rather cluttered with numerous projects, games, books, CDs, computer parts, etc. so wires, mice, game controllers have a tendancy to get tangled and like any lynch pin, move one and they all come crashing down. While the headset works, it's a little wonky in its functioning. It sounds just fine, but the microphone shaft is too short and ends up sitting on my cheek a half-inch shy of my mouth and doesn't pick up spoken word all that well. worse, it's kinda flimsy, the plastic too soft. It has a bulky volume control with mute button about a foot down the cord from the headset while at the other end is a small box with the Playstation logo on it. I suspect its a pre-amp or a signal changer, but it seems kind of obtrusive and gets in the way. Is it worth owning? Not at its current price- if it were ten bucks cheaper it would be worth it. It does what its supposed to do, but not very well. There must be a better substitute somewhere. Just great! The headphone & mic just fell of my desk and broke! A grand total of 1 meter. Cheap junk.	-1
It was rather uncomfortable all things conisdred. Pretty Meh quality sound etc.  You can find better for roughly the same price if not a few bucks more. Look for those instead.	-1
This head set is pretty good. And I'm not rough when I handle tech. I owned two of them at different times and both of them just died. I'm researching and that seems a problem with Logitech products.	-1
Played for 30 min got bored took it back to the video store. Who ever came up with this idea for a game must have been on Geritol.	-1
At best this headset purchase will be a crap shoot. Even after i read complaint after complaint about this headset, after only 2 days, the mic stopped working. It's not only the PS3 for which I bought this for, I even tested it on my PC using Skype, and it still won't work.  Too bad, other than the fact that sound only comes out of one ear, the other is a dummy speaker, it keeps popping off!  Yes it's cheaply made, but if only the mic would last for more than a few days it would be worth the headache. I only hope I get my money back as I am returning it without the original packaging, cause it was working! BUT ONLY FOR 2 DAYS! One star for each day it worked.	-1
missing 2nd cd	-1
This thing is a mess. My PS3 barely identifies it most of the time,and its a struggle to make it work. Every time I plug it into the PS3,and go to accessory settings to choose my input device,it is not even listed as an option. 10% of the time,it may appear,and I can chose it. And when that does,it works great.  However,for $25 that is a really,really bad deal. You would be wiser to spend your money on the Sony one,and avoid this shoddy work of material. Maybe I got a dud,I don't know,I just thought I'd warn you.  My opinion: Avoid. Avoid. AVOID.	-1
This is a shoddy product. First of all I didn't know it was only a single speaker on your left ear, the right side is a very uncomfortable plastic paddle that digs into the side of your skull and makes me want to rip it into pieces. So no stereo audio possible and it's uncomfortable. The mic was perfect and clear on the PS3, but I wanted a headset I could use to play a game in the early morning without waking anyone up before I go to work, with sound in only one ear it was horrible for games like Mag, can't tell the directions rockets come from etc.  Sum it up to keep this short: Mono sound in left ear only, uncomfortable, clear mic but worthless since I don't want to wear it. Spend the extra $3 for a full stereo USB headset that isn't shoddy from Logitech.	-1
It has a nice feel to it, but when used for my Mac and WoW the volume is terrible. I have to use the external speakers to hear what the person on the other end it saying and unlike most USB headsets, this has no built-in volume control. Works well for the PS3 though.	-1
Great game and I really enjoyed it when it first released, BUT the graphics on the PC have aged terribly and I even have a brand new graphics card and drivers and it still looked pathetic, Vice City just doesn't do it for me anymore when there are better games out now that have move features and better graphics.	-1
I bought this item brand new only last week and tried it to my new PS3 because im so excited to talk to my friends while playing Resistance:Fall of Man....to my suprise this item does not work at all thou the power is on but i cant hear them......im planning to return it back and probably switch to HBH-610a bluetooth...	-1
After careful consideration, I think I'm going to have to go against the masses and say that this game was really kind of dumb.  I was expecting a lot better.  This was my 1st GTA game, and the last.  Sure, it's fun to drive a car/motorcycle/ambulance as crazily as you can and run over people.  Sure it's interesting to run from the police... for awhile.  Sure it's different to fly a chopper.  But really, it gets kind of monotonous.  Quickly.  After running around the town millions of time and failing some of the same missions, buying weapons and killing people on the street for money... you just find yourself saying, "What's the point?"  Oh, one thing though... KCHAT is hysterical!  :)	-1
Grand theft auto vice city is, as you may know, one of the most lauded computer games of all time and you will find no shortage of enthusiasts singing its praises on amazon.  While there has also been a great deal of negativity about this game, and moral condemnation, it has usually been from people who don't much actually play computer games and from many who did not take much time to see what this game is about or understand its context. That doesn't mean these people are entirely wrong, but it does mean they are mostly wrong, and, actually, one of the very clever things gta vice city does is actually lampoon the hypocrisy of its critics.  This, along with some excellent music, is done on the game's brilliant radio stations that play randomly in any of the cars you steal. I was a little surprised that the in game radio was perhaps my favorite thing from the game.  Anyway, that's a pretty wordy preamble. You maybe just want to know what I thought of the game, so I won't go into an essay on morality in computer games.  I'll tell you what I thought.  I thought the game was all kind of a joke, which is fine, just, it was a mean joke.  Its meant to be played as a mean joke.  I didn't like that so much.  From here I'll just rank it according to some categories I devised reflecting issues important to me.  Story:  C-  never very great in computer games, but, taking that into account it was pretty nicely done, ridiculous at times,  the free roaming thing integrated well with it, you sort of intersect with different lines of the story as you like,  still linear- don't know how you could have a story without that- but, like I said, it's all a bit of a mean joke and I got tired of it. I cant say how well it developed as I only managed to play about a quarter way through this game.  Characters:  C-  clever, very well voice acted, colorful types but completely lacking in any emotional connection whatsoever.  Gameplay:  C  here is where I really expected this game to be so great but was surprised it wasn't.  The variety of things to do was good, driving, shooting, very different kinds of missions, etc, but mainly I never much liked the shooting stuff. I thought it had a stiff jerkiness to it, found it unnatural and not as good as an average shooter.  The city was neat but I never felt like it was very satisfying, like, you could really only be a thug and that's it. I guess that's the point, you could do a lot within that, just, there wasn't any feeling of richness or depth, just breadth.  Graphics: C-  again disappointing. I was expecting something terrific, but was surprised to find that, though the city was beautiful in its way, the character modeling was pretty unimpressive and seemed sort of out of date (even more so now). The stylish, cartoony characters of the box are not a fair representation of the more graceless figures in the game.  Dreariness factor:  D+  personally mugging people and shooting and vandalizing and stealing my way to power kind of brought me down.  It was nice to do it by the ocean though.  Technical issues:  did not have problems. That's just me.  Learning factor:  C+  the game helps you along pretty well with a while-you-play sort of tutorial.  But quite a few things you're left on your own to figure out and controls for keyboard on certain missions (like an awful remote control helicopter) were very difficult to learn and handle.  Product materials:  D+  a good example of stylish but sort of useless.  Just tell me in detail about how things work and about controls and stuff.  All too often in pc games I get either almost no info or, like this, a bunch of setting the stage. Cute, but useless.  Chore factor:  F  see below  Difficulty:  F  yes, I am all alone in this maybe, but most games are too hard! Difficulty levels are god's gift to a diverse population!  Especially useful difficulty levels.  This had none whatsoever.  Some things you do are easier, some are hard and, SINCE THERE ARE NO IN GAME SAVES, you (I) have to do them over and over, from the start.  Game saves: F  no.  there are these save places you can go to or you can sort of lose a lot of stuff and just come out of the police station or hospital, but either way creates quite a bit of tediousness, often involving a bit of a drive just to get there.  Other: if the concept of this game sort of leaves you cold but you're curious because its such  a well reviewed game I really say, don't bother.  If it sounds hilarious to be a rising young tough driving around `miami' in cars you stole I do sincerely recommend it.  It totally got the whole weird pulp fiction gangster movie amoral thing pretty well.	-1
GRAND THEFT AUTO VICE CITY is one of the greatest games of all time! But don't make the mistake I did. I've already owned the game on the PS2, so I made a dumb decision by buying it on the PC, where I thought the game would have better graphics and controls. I WAS DEAD WRONG! Don't buy this game on the PC unless you have a good computer! I have a Windows XP, so I won't recommend you playing games on this computer! The graphics are even worse then in the PS2 version, and the controls are terrible. What a waste of [money]! Don't be a moron like me, and don't buy this game if you have a [bad] computer!	-1

Guys are you serious? golden sun tla get 4.8/5 stars? Why everyone rated this mediocre game so high is beyond me.  Positive - I like the puzzle-oriented dungeons and the Dijn system - some tunes are catchy - at least better story then golden sun 1  Negative - worst sound effect ever, really disturb me, the noise of a drill is a lot better to my  ears - graphic in the word map is laughable, the most deformed pile of pixel ever seen, the other in game graphics are no good either. battle graphic is pixellated almost as the word map. the exploration graphics are really overrated, repetitive and the color palette is too light. - story is very lacking, childish, generic, cliche and predictable. - characters are not interesting at all, a bunch of  stereotyped childs. - aside from the story, this game is 100% identical to golden sun 1 - arghh the worst thing about golden sun, the atrocious script. I nerver seen most long, stupid and boring dialogues like these. seems like the script is writed by moron  childs... and for moron childs, the yes-no choices are totally useless and make the game dialogue even more stupid.  graphic : 5/10 music: 8/10 story: 5/10 characters: 5/10 gameplay: 8/10 sound effect: 0/10 originality: -10/10 dialogue: -1000000000000000/10	-1
This game has ok graphics for today's first person shooter standard. I don't like the fact that you can't just kill without saying freeze or something. It gets really old really fast. Rent it and beat it without spending the $50 or $40. Maybe wait until it drops down to $20. This game is cool because of the futuristic weapons and it's a squad based first person shooter. Just with some issues	-1
As a gamer since age 9 (when I first saw Asteroids in an arcade) I have played and beaten hundreds of games. Battlestar Galactica is so frustrating that I put it away after 9 attempts to get through level 1! Yes, LEVEL 1! I just stopped caring. Any game that forces you play through the SAME 15 minutes of gameplay every time you die towards the end of a level is a waste of my time. No save points. No mid-mission saves. I could be out making money, or going on a date or playing something that's actually fun and rewarding. What makes me so mad about Galactica is the fact that the graphics/sounds are really well done...that and the fact that I have waited 29 years to fly a Viper in a video game and when I finally do, I want to forget the name Battlestar Galactica altogether. Strictly for the sadists out there. I just finished the game BLACK and found it to be a walk in the park compared to this game....Look for my copy used online.	-1
I was not pleased with this game. Although I am a major fan of the both the original and remade Battlestar Galactica this game was very difficult to control and track the cylons right from mission 1.  Unless you are already an ace at working the controllers and have every button's location memorized like your hand, you'll spend most of your time trying to even find a cylon (even though they are all over you and the Galactica).  Part two of mission 1 is almost impossible to beat and you have to start the game over from the very start every time.  Stick with just the TV shows.	-1
I had loved the Zelda series, but was dismayed when I saw Wind Waker. The cartoonish graphics look childish and amateurish. I nonetheless decided to rent the game and give it a shot. However, I gave up after a half hour or so. It just wasn't fun and wasn't worth my time.	-1
I must agree with most of the other user reviews criticizing High Heat 2004. Incredibly, THERE IS NO MOUSE SUPPORT for this supposed PC Game! Whoever made the decision to sell out High Heat PC users this way should be fired immediately! Not only is there no mouse support but the menu interface is a complete nightmare!  It's literaly an ordeal just trying to set up and start a game! I will never understand why a company will take a very good PC  product and just tear it down for game consoles!  3DO has sold PC users out for game consoles! Just like NBA Live 2003, High Heat 2004 has gone over to the dark side!  It's no wonder that there is no demo. Five minutes with this intolerable interface would convince any PC User not to bother.   The graphics are better and the game is still fun to play but the terrible interface and many missing features ruin it. The sound and color commentary have improved little, if at all. I think it's time to send a message to companies like EAsports and 3D0 who sell out PC Users for consoles! If I wanted to play a Playstation game, I would buy a Playstation!	-1
Have bought every installment of High Heat, and have loved it.  This version is simply terrible.  If I wanted a console port, I would not buy a pc version.  The lack of mouse support made the totally unintuitive menues even more difficult.  Two out of the 3 games I played crashed and one was the only fun game, that was in extra innings.  The player graphics look like arcade models and really do not look realistic.  Some of the player animations are entertaining. For some reason, the game would not take the pitching imputs from my sidewinder, often requiring more than five attempts (yes my sidewinder was calibrated and works fine with other games).  This interrupt the game play and is very frustrating.  This has happened in past HH versions, but seems worse in this one. I felt angry and insulted that I was given a console game in the guise of a pc game.  I am sad that they have ruined an outstanding franchise, again.	-1
As a long time fan of the X-Files,I am sorry to say,but this game sucks. The storyline is just flat out dumb,the controls are crap,the voice acting is so bad,that it's laughable and it's not even in the least bit scary. There was absolutley no effort put into this game at all,and it shows. Youre much better off buying one of the Silent Hill,Resident Evil or Fatal Frame games,then this.	-1
well, this game started off looking really cool, i mean the graphics are great and YOU'RE MULDER running around with a flashlight and pistol, what could be cooler?  sadly, the gameplay is very much what you'd expect from a subpar game.. running around, it LOOKS kind of like indigo prophecy which is very good, but without any of the good parts of that game..  you run around and when you walk next to something that requires an action, an "X" appears on the screen.  so it's just a matter of finding X's!  takes all thought out of it.  when you run around, the camera changes, so let's say you run down.. the screen changes and suddenly you're supposed to be moving the controller UP!  this happens over and over and is really annoying.  again, it LOOKS great.  it just isn't fun to PLAY.  to compound that problem, you have to run around areas that look similar, so it's very disorienting and confusing, running up.. oh wait, am i running down or up?  where am i?!    you have a notebook with notes from scully.. unfortunately the notes are HANDWRITTEN!  making them really hard to read, at least on my TV.  and besides, who wants to READ during a PS2 game?  on to shooting.. shooting is "meh."  it could definitely be worse, but could definitely be better.  it's just not very good.  i gave up on this game pretty fast..  an x-files game is a cool idea, but didn't like this one.	-1
I had this game a few years back,and it was without a doubt,one of the top five hardest games I have EVER played in my life. Words cannot describe how hard this game is. It's really a shame too,because this game is actually really cool. The graphics,the music,the story...all of that is excellent. It's just too dang hard! If you get agrovated easily...then I HIGHLY recommend that you do NOT buy this game. If you want one of the hardest games ever made...then go for it.	-1
Note to video game developers: Before the discussions/meetings on gameplay mechanics begin, please insure a basic requirement for your title is met:  It's actually fun to play.  It really is amazing how the simplest things escape people; a lot of whom are very intelligent. Unfortunately, this is exactly what has befallen "Team Ninja," the developers of Ninja Gaiden.  The graphics, while very good for the original xbox, remain the sole redeeming value for this travesty of a title. Excruciatingly frustrating to the point of shouting expletives and tossing the controller, I wonder in amazement had the developer even bothered to perform play/beta testing with gamers. Surely they would've received tons of feedback on just how frustrating the camera can be; how it becomes an 'invisible enemy' along with the many real enemies the game throws at Ryu, the character you control.  Not only that, but it is guaranteed that the gamer will be forced to play through several scenes at least 3-5 times before progressing (without some sort of guide.)  People play video games for amusement; not for frustration and angst. They represent an escape from life's everyday conundrums- and Ninja Gaiden is the polar opposite of that simple premise.  Note to Team Ninja- before anything else, make sure your "games" are actually fun to play.	-1
Don't believe the crap that they try to sell you here. The reason that its getting so many stars is because they're trying to sell it back and get rid of it, and I'll tell you why.  First off, the graphics are nothing special. The camera angle is just flat out piss pore. You have to fight the camera every step of the way, throughout the game. (You'll know what I mean if you go and play it.)The options menu doesn't help ether, when you go to change the controls on your controller it just makes it harder if anything.  The level settings are also a complete failure, you'll die at least 30 times just to get to the second level, while the setting is on easy. You can take my word on that.  Throughout the game your in a constant state of fighting an uphill battle, your constantly out numbered, your usually almost dead at the end of every battle.  You will say to yourself at times; "How can anyone play this game on a hard level and actually win?"  The level that I made it to was a boss on a horse that constantly had men showing up, is just impossible to beet. After that I just quit the game.  In a nutshell: The the fighting engine is awful. The camera angles are a never ending struggle. Option menu is useless. And the pressure just continues as you go on. The harder it gets, the less you want to play it.  Unless if you get joy out of yelling at your TV all the time. Do NOT buy or even rent this game. This game is increasingly stressful and you will find NO rest or fun in this game at all.	-1
No Doubt this game is great!! But I do not have time to constantly restarting playing the same old area to get to where I died previously. Camera does sucked at times.. Constantly have to adjust your camera to see your path ahead. Save points are far apart. Time is essence. With people like me who has tons of game to play, I wanna finished one game and move on to the next one. With such unjustable difficulty level, I think I would $%^#king forego this game and move on to the next one. I do not intend to kill myself with such difficulty. The creators are Gods I know. But there are a whole bunch of gamers around the world who are not God Gamers!!! Who seek a sense of completing a game because they want to experience the thrill and the excitement of a great game like Ninja Gaiden. However this I can say is definitely not worth my time playing it. When you create a game, you wanna make sure that gamers who play it can complete the game so that they will have an awesome experience and if they feel like challenging themselves to a greater difficulty level, then they may do so at there own will. Games must be created with various difficulty level in mind. If they want to reach out to mass gamers, that is just what they need to do. People like myself aren't expert at games but enjoyed playing and completing it to experience something that could not be experienced in TV, movies or elsewhere. With games it is the only hope for me to explore the sci-fi and fantasy world beyond my imagination. And yet Ninja Gaiden has failed to do so and my only advice to gamers are if you have the time to spend playing over and over again where you got killed, then by all means go ahead, if not find another game that will make you feel happy and satisfied. Because I know I am moving on, PERIOD!!! With this I rest my case.	-1
Funny thing:  I was at a Gamestop the day this game came out and I was very tempted to purchase a copy.  My lovely lady advised otherwise and for once the crack of the whip was a good thing.  I rented the game and played about three hours into it before giving up all hope.  The graphics were beautiful, but that should go without saying -If you're going to delay a game for months upon months to tweak it, and then ask 50 bucks for it, it had better look nice and purdy.  So whoopty-hey on the gorgeous animations.  Software designers have no excuse for not raising the bar graphic-wise with all the computer technology they now have at their disposal. The gameplay is linear and stagnant.  - "Fight these three brown ninjas! Here comes a white ninja! - Fight this monster, oh wait, more ninjas!!"  About the only rewarding feeling while playing the game was getting to run up walls and flip over people onto ledges etc.  But you can't have fun flipping around all day long because that damn "random ninja generator" is cranked to 11, and wave after wave of generic ninjas will keep attacking you as you play.  - So you can't enjoy the wall hopping without having to participate in Ninja Gaiden's stale fighting system. (Maybe they should have done a Ninja Olympics game??) **There is no ragdoll and the ninja's, when killed, die in about the same three or four poses.  This makes for very monotonous gameplay.  They attack the same way, and then they die the same way.  Zzz. (Ps - The camera/view system is bearable at best. - Which is funny, because the game constantly emphasizes how a true ninja must be extremely observant and adept at looking around. - You'll spend a great deal of time wrestling with compromising camera angles.)**  The bosses, as I'm sure you've heard, are ridiculously hard.  But not in a fun advanced AI sense, where you feel the joy of battle... No, I'm afraid not at all.  The bosses are hard in the sense that they know what you are about to do before you do it, and constantly thwart your every attempt to attack them.  To defeat the bosses, you have to waste about 6 or 7 tries finding out what moves not to do, and what pattern it's okay to attack in.  To me, that's not a fun challenge.. that's more of a math equation done with an Xbox controller instead of a calculator.  Tecmo thinks it's funny to waste our time ;) To end on a good note I must say that the story is solid.  And of course, the character artwork and animation is beautiful and fluid.  Very fun to watch.  (Sorry Tecmo, I just ran out of compliments.) If you're a hardcore fan of the original games, hey, buy it. - You're bound to make it fun for yourself.  But if it was the hype train that brought you here, I would advise that you rent this one before buying it. - Metaphorically, this game is a shiny new Corvette with my craptacular 4 cylinder Ford engine powering it.  Savy?	-1
Ok..I have to admit, for awhile I was addicted to the sims-- I mean totally addicted. I had all sorts of crazy dyfunctional families living in the most bizarre houses and wearing the most bizarre clothes I could possibly find. All of my sims were at the top of their career ladders with tons of friends and lots of money. But then I realized... something was definitely missing. The games just weren't fun anymore. I even bought Unleashed, Vacation, and Living Large to add something..that missing ingredient. But I still haven't found it. And The Sims now sits on the shelf all alone..and I don't think I ever want to play it again. The little objects are "amusing" for awhile, but then everything becomes too repitive. A game is supposed to take you far and away into a whole different world, but the Sims is almost exactly like normal day life with a few strange objects, perfect weather, and never-aging people. No matter how many new junk Maxis piles into the expansion packs, the game will never have a point. And please, if you already got a lot of Sims products, you really need to stop buying these games. They become a large expense, take up a ton of computer memory, and get pretty boring in a short period of time.	-1
The makers of this game should have either NOT named this Fallout OR added a disclaimer that this game is NOT apart of the Fallout Canon  This game should be considered a lame 'ode' to Fallout rather than an actual FO game.  Gameplay sucks, graphics suck, over-use of foul language and lame inappropriate jokes ((all the time, left and right))  Instead of Nuka-Cola, Bawls soda appears in the game ***huge annoying distraction outside of the FO canon; and many weapons are named for modern guns (example: "Desert Eagle")  Unless (you can get this game cheap and) your an avid Fallout fan curious as to what the fuss was all about (Canon/non-canon) DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY  *The makers of THIS game should be exiled to Antarctica!	-1
This game is average to slightly hard level. Spyro's moves are ice breath, super ice breath, fire breath, fire ball, wind, super wind-electric breath, glide, and charge. His objective is to collect items and gems and trade them for hearts needed to complete the game. The game is relatively boring, especially whenever your constantly going back and forth between two worlds to open chest or return items you you've found. There is almost no storyline, as with most Spyro games.	-1
Yeah, you heard me right. Before you go ballistic on me, though, let me say WHY this game has infuriated me. Essentially, this game is the exact same as Infection. You still run around computer generated dungeons, trying to forward the story (which does get a bit more interesting, but not NEARLY enough to save this game). You still data drain and gate hack and fight big bosses with your ever-growing party (all of the new characters, incidentally, have the most annoying voices and inane dialogue imaginable) until you duke it out with a super boss at the end, and save your data to load into the next game. Of course, this isn't enough to warrant 1 star; indeed I played the first game and liked it, despite being too easy and a bit short (only 20-25 hours to beat the last boss). No, where this game fails is the following: You are actually PENALIZED for purchasing and playing the first game! By playing Infection, you essentially remove half of the levels in Mutation! That's right; BANDAI, in its infinite wisdom, decided that they would put amny of the levels from Infection into Mutation, I guess so that they could bring in some new saps. Of course, that means that they've given the shaft to fans of the game, figuring that we're so stupidly addicted to their product that we will purchase the sequels, no matter WHAT they do. So, there are no benefits to playing the first game, except that you can keep you old emails and character name (whoopee). I finished Mutation in 9 hours. NINE!!!! I've already been burned, but I hope I can give YOU an option. If you want to play 9 hours for fifty bucks, buy the game. Otherwise, I suggest you wait for Xenosaga, episode 2; those folks know how to TREAT fans!	-1
Ever since Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance came out for the PS-2 it spawned many similar action/rpg hybrid clones. For example there is the Champions of Norrath series and even Hunter the Reckoning. These games attempt to take the themes we enjoyed about Ever Quest, Baldur's Gate, and the world of darkness and make them into entertaining hack n slash co-op fests. In that regard Brother-Hood is more of the same. While it may wear a cheap Vault dweller uniform you can tell it is more " loot n shoot" than it is Fall Out 1-2 or Fall-out tactics.  I understand why the Fall-out fans were peeved about Brother-Hood of steel. It was at a time Fall Out 3 had been promised many times only to let us down. Of course Bethesda FINALLY answered our prayers so bitterness and skepticism are things of the past.  The main thing you should know is this is NOT going to stand up to Fall-Out 3. Fall out 3 has a great series of plots. Brother Hood of steel doesn't. Fall out 3 has interesting non player characters to interact with in myriad ways. Brother-hood of Steel's NPCs are a cliche nasty bar tender, a prostitute, a cowardly mayor, and an old gnarled military vet missing an arm. Yup, I'd say Carbon has about 6 NPCs to talk to and that's it.  However keep in mind Brother-hood of steel was not even trying to be Fall-Out 3 to begin with. It simply wanted to provide a fun 2-player destruction fest in a post apocalyptic world setting which is interesting. On that level it does succeed. Assuming you have a friend over it can pass the time. However I imagine playing it alone is a drab task of monotony.  Each brother hood of steel initiate has different strengths and weaknesses. The girl is fast and agile, the tribal male is the proverbial slower power-house, and Kain the cool ghoul can actually walk through radiation without it harming him. When he upgrades certain attributes rads even heal him.  I'd elaborate more but that's it. None of these characters have profound connections to their world. There is no stellar story line on the horizon. You accept a mission, kill raiders, ghouls, mutants, scorpions, rats, and death claws, upgrade equipment, and repeat that in tedium about 50 more times.  While this game is supposed to follow the formula of a Fall-out Diablo a little innovation would have been nice. For example it would be better if some missions were personal to certain characters or that you could actually make pivotal choices instead of just being given the illusion of choices through giving those you talk to varied responses.  I believe even 2-player action RPGs can have lovable protagonists and deep plots but apparently those in charge rather crank out the same dull uninspired engine over and over again.  If you have a friend over all the shooting and smashing is fun, then again the same can be said of almost any game using this same premise.  If you find this game in a bargain bin or for dirt cheap pick it up but if someone is asking for a high price laugh at them, extend your middle digit, and proceed to getting FallOut 3. (Aka how Fall-Out SHOULD be done!)  Pros  + A decent 2 player hack n slash fest.  Cons  - Nothing to offer a single player and lack luster in almost every regard. Cussing, profanity, and kinky clad raider girls does not automatically make a game worthy of the name "Fall-Out".	-1
Not fallout.  Not fun.  You want it, I'll give it to you.  Never mind I have a conscious.  If your looking for that old Fallout click and fun thing, it's gone.  Different sequences for your hero's path is not in here.  Visiting towns... it sucks!  It's Gauntlet in Fallout world.	-1
This is a polygonal beat-em-up game along the lines of Fighting Force and Hidden Invasion. And like those two, it's a horrible game. The camera is sloppy. Not as bad as Hidden Invasion, but it can sometimes get stuck at inappropriate places (I ain't talkin' in a good way either!), and you have no control over it. The gameplay is monotonous. You knock thugs around and then follow an arrow to where you beat more people up. At some point in the stage, you press the A button to activate a switch or call another Angel. The controls are awkward. Once again, the analog shoulder buttons are used at full disadvantage: you have to press them all the way in until they click. On the default control set-up, you jump with B, punch with Y, kick with X, pick stuff up with A, focus on an enemy with R, switch targets with Z, and temporarily power-up with L. This setting can be frustrating when trying to perform an arial attack. You can also switch the actions of B and X, but that doesn't really make things easier. If you have to know, the Start button pauses the game and brings up a menu, the control stick moves the Angel, and the cross-pad and yellow C-stick do nothing as far as I remember. The music is so-so, with various techno-tunes and a louzy digital song at the Start Menu. You can access bonus features, such as a Teaser, photos, and...uh, I can't remember what else, by collecting CDs and memory sticks scattered around the areas. You can also watch each computer-generated Full-Motion Video piece as many times as you want after you get to that part in the game. The character models might pass for okay on an earlier console, but on today's systems, I expect more polygons and better textures. The outfits aren't too bad though. I don't recommend buying this game or even playing it. If you have to satisfy your curiosity like I did, try a rental.	-1
Actually, the more I play the more I wanna change my review. I've noticed some good things and bad things. The campaign is as I said nothing special. Seems pathetic compared to ROC. They couldn't even work in the orcs, so they made them a "bonus" campaign, which involves you do some boring tasks, than ends. People say later you download more, but thats just a rumor. Anyways, the problem isn't building. There are 2 types of missions. Get a hero, fight to the exit, while rescuing units of yours who for some reason still have their weapons even when in jail. Theres also get a half built base, upgrade your townhall or tree or whatever, than attack. Most missions are so easy to complete with the starting units you are given. The real problem is the characters. There are no backgrounds to any character or development. Maiev wants revenge over some dead guards so she hunts illidan, that is her ENTIRE story. You never learn anything else about her, except she has some real problems with being nice. Kael hungers for magic, which is stupid. Arthas is boring, wants to get his power back, and help the king of liches. Pretty boring. Then theres the crypt lord, ana'narub. He says "I was sent to aid you from the lich king" and bam thats it. You never learn anything about him. He is so boring. Then once you finish campaigns there is NO ending, and you learn what happens to NONE of the characters except one. Yes you have to wait for a new game because there was no ending really. It never says "Kael decided to eat, so he stopped being hungry". It says nothing about any of those characters. Battle.net seems to be boring. Every game is usually a rush now. They downgraded most unit costs, and now it is incredibly easy to get mass units and attack. Out of the 100 or so ladder games I have played, only a few involved zero rushing. Tournaments are boring, match after match, people love chatting about nothing. Clan support has added the new constant spamming. Every public channel involves tons of newb clans talking about how they "pwn" everyone and are "1337" so we should all join. The new units are boring. Spell breakers got old. Dragonhawks were in ROC just you couldn't build them, the AI could. Wyverns have had their name changed to Wind Riders for some odd reason. Batriders are fun, except noone goes them. I hate having to take down mountain giants, but they aren't too bad, same with those spirit walkers. Some units have been changed. Tanks are now engines and gyros are now flying machines. Boring. I don't know why they changed those units, but anyways. There are some new buildings, like nerubian towers, arcane towers, the 4 new item shops, thats about it for players. Than taverns and market places which are pretty boring. Neutral heroes are alright. Naga sea witch kinda boring, pit lord fun, beast master involves alot of summoning, dark ranger involves some life sucking, and the pandaran is probably the biggest relief. Its better than "vashj". Which reminds me, blizzard needs to get a good name department, cause the names for the new heroes and such are terrible.	-1
This game is a lame excuse for attention.  The missions are meaningless and stupid.  You go to the store to buy a gallon of milk, there's one mission.  The game says "only as violent as you are" but is intentionaly made for you to be as violent as possible, or the missions wouldn't be so linear and stupid. Cutting a young girl's head off with a shovel, blowing a police officers head off with a shotgun and kicking it around as a soccer ball, pouring gasoline on someone and lighting them on fire, and harming/brutaly murdering helpless animals are some examples of the terrible and discusting violence included.  Obviously the people that make this need to be sent to an insane asylum because it is not funny at all.  It's the grossest game on the market and totaly uncalled for.  If you're gonna make a game as graphicly violent as you can, the least you could do is include some bad guys.  But there are none at all, except for yourself.  The graphics aren't good, and everything else about the game "is bad" to an unbelievably high extent.  I'm not one to complain about a violent video game but this is just sick.  Go buy GTA3 or Vice City if you want to go on a rampage because this game is sofa king dumb.  Avoid at any and all costs.  If you find it on a shelf for 99 cents on clearence, it's still not worth it because it's such a bad game.	-1
Obviously intended to be irreverent, super-violent, and disturbing, rating Postal 2 on a politically correct, moral, or ethical basis would be ridiculous. So let's just rate it on quality of programming and enjoyment of gameplay, shall we? The graphics: Not bad, but certainly not on par with games like No One Lives Forever 2 and Mafia. The game does utilize the Unreal engine and has some nice textures here and there, but the town has a very artificial and claustrophobic feel to it. The NPC textures are o.k., as well, but nowhere near those in Return to Castle Wolfenstein. The sounds: Very so-so. I found the weapon sounds in particular to be very unrealistic - especially the AR15. (It sounds like an airgun.) In a game where gunplay is an essential part of the fun, this is a glaring flaw. A.I. - Not nearly good enough to be satisfying in the way the game claims to aspire to. To truly descend into the cellar of bad taste, the NPC's would have to behave in a believable manner, with a certain complexity of interaction available. As it stands, the NPC's have a very limited range of behaviors. This, combined with the so-so graphics makes for a very artificial environment. Gameplay: Obviously, the creators did not have the funding nor programming talent to make Postal 2 into a game with cutting-edge graphics and groundbreaking gameplay. Even with these limitations, however, the developers could have made the game far more fun with just a little thought into what makes all of us want to go "postal". Getting stuck in traffic, having to wait in long lines, getting diss'd by a rude employee - with a little creativity, the programmers could have inserted these scenarios into the game to add fuel to our virtual postal tendencies. As it stands, apart from the postal dude's general psychosis, your player has no real motivation to go wacky - and the A.I. just isn't good enough to make it fun when you do. Without these assets, any open-ended environment - no matter how big - won't keep you coming back for more... System Specs: P4 1.9ghz, 512mb rambus, Geforce4 Ti4600 128mb, Soundblaster Xgamer. Game ran fine on highest resolution with only a few stutters here and there, but I found loading times to be a bit excessive - especially considering the lesser graphic quality.	-1
Most of this game was a bore. It was funny at times but really a complete waste of time to play. Do not pay more than 2 or 3 bucks for this game.	-1
Postal 2 with out a doubt in my mind, IS one of the most violent video games ever made, sure the game never made it to controversial status like Grand Theft Auto but the game was still very very...disturbing.  I mean you can do things like blow off a cops head with a shotty, piss on people, urin on animals, set dogs and cats on fire and LITERALY throw a moltov at a marching band and have them go crazy, running about screaming for help while they're running around in fire...The game is indeed sick AND FUNNY.  Other then the games violence, another plus is the friggin humor, it's hilarious with some of the vulgar and funny stuff postal dude says.  The game takes place in a(not so huge)town where you can go around freeroaming and doing random things like going to the arcade or getting some milk in the convenient store.  Now of course that's not what you're suppose to do in the game...basicly everyday you come out of your trailer house and have abunch of errands to do(some which are very funny)and some(well acctually alot)of them will have funny misshaps causing chaos and violence.  Overall the game is pretty funny, the missions are somewhat pointless at times and the games violence makes GTA look like an E rated video game made by Disney. First of all I will get this out of the way, I had a really fun time with this game but overall it's not a game you should shell out 50 bucks(well I should have said that at the time I was playing the game cause it was indeed 50 bucks).  I for one did not spend the 50 dollars, I had it burned from a friend and now I'll get to it....  First of all I loved some of the missions, especially the one with Garycoleman and a few others, they were some pretty funny stuff right there, and some were abit disturbing(like the one where you have to visit your fathers grave)but overall everymission was quite entertaining.  Visualy, the games average, no wows, not Greats nothing special JUST average.  The weapons are awesome especially the one with the cat silencer and the areas and places you visit were splinded to see at some points.  Now other then the funny missions and the game weapons, over the top violence the humor does get a LITTLE stale at some points and I will say this and I don't care for your flaming but THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY LOAD TIMES AND THEY TAKE FOREVER!!  There are some points where I could go downstairs and get a drink and come back up and the load time would still be there!  And alot of the missions become very very boring and repetitive.  The load Times are horrid, the humor does get very stale and the gameplay may get boring REAL fast to some(heck maybe many!)and the game is just TOO SHORT(If you ignore the friggin load times and the stupid A.I you will notice the game is ridiculously short and I beat this on Normal mode, not to mention the game takes place in a 5 day period/scenario)..To some you will like it, to many you will hate it....and to others like myself you'll probably find it to be a below average FPS..But overall...I DID have a fun time with it..  The Good  -The humor gets at times is pretty funny  -Gary Coleman...nuff said  -Some missions are really really really funny  -You can use a cat as a silencer!!!  -If you like a game with horrible acts of violence, and animal abuse you will love this game  The Bad  -Gets Old REAL fast  -Load times are just........horrible..  -Some missions in my opiinon were just plain LAME  -This game may offend ALOT of people  -Some missions were abit frustraiting  -Nothing els to really do other then mess around, after you beat the game  -very short, just borrow it from someone you know, who owns the game  -In my opion...just a below average game(only to be played for kicks and fun)  Well I'm done with my complaining and ranting, the game is 20 bucks now and I still think it's not worth the cash, its short, not a very great game but the humor and jokes at times are hilarious but get stale later on...some of the games missions were just plain boring, only the violence, Gary Coleman and some of the missions kept the game entertaining for me at some points...but overall all I just didn't think the game was really that good...  I give this a  2.5 out of 5	-1
I thought it'd be fun to play an ultra-violent game for a change.  It was fun, for the first 5 minutes.  After that, the game gets a little old and makes you a little cranky.  Especially when you sit and wait for the next scenario to load.  I think the developers did that on purpose to tick-off the gamer even more, and make him even more violent. The graphics started out nice enough, but I guess the guy doing the building interiors had the week off when they put this game together. As far as a fulfilling experience, the only thing this game teaches is how to get mad.  Most of us have figured that out, already. For all you Gary Coleman fans, this game is a must!!! For everyone else, you can find better use of your time.	-1
Developer Running With Scissors was obviously trying to cash in on the popularity of Rockstar's "Grand Theft Auto" series, and they failed miserably.  The game is boring and pointless. The plot is simple: the player assumes the role of "The Postal Dude" and, each day, sets off to complete a list of boring tasks, like going to the store for milk.  Invariably each mundane task ends in disaster as various nutty groups in the game burst in and start shooting. The game plays up the "choice" the player has, whether to be passive or to "go postal" with various weapons.  There's no reason to play passive, and the novelty of the over-the-top violence gets old fast.  Characters spout inane dialog, and the only high point of the game is when Gary Coleman (yes, Gary Coleman) makes an appearance at a mall which, of course, ends in a gun battle. Although powered by the Unreal engine, Postal 2 looks drab.  Out of the box, the game has some serious bugs, including ridiculously long load times between levels.  This gets frustrating fast as there are so many level changes to get from point A to point B.  A recent patch has fixed this issue, but the game remains a pointless exercise in futility. Sometimes the saving grace for a bad single-player game can be the multiplayer option.  "Postal 2" does not have multiplayer.  Instead, you have to actually purchase the multiplayer add-on for $9.95.  Running With Scissors might have scored an extra star had it released the multiplayer part for free, as was the case with the "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" multiplayer expansion, "Enemy Territory," which started life as an expansion to RTCW and ended up being a free stand-alone product. You're better off spending the $20 on the vastly superior "Grand Theft Auto III" or, for ten bucks more, "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City."  Either choice is a better one than the terminally boring "Postal 2."	-1
Everything Im about to say concerning Postal 2, you've probably already read.  The shock value of lighting innocent people on fire and going on random ... crazy rampages ebbs away rather quickly.  And when I say LONG load times, I mean exactly that.  The gameplay map is divided into about 8 or 9 main sections.  You traverse this map section by section.  Everytime you wish to travel to a new part of the map you get stuck between areas with load times that can last up to 5 minutes.  - Yep, I said 5 minutes.  I ran the game on a 1.8 gz cpu with 512 ram.  - Still took a ridiculous amount of time to load.  The constant 'hurry up and wait' in this game extinguishes a gamer's lust for blood and nulls any interest you may have had for its mundane storyline.  Considering how brilliant and user-friendly today's FPS can be, this game has no excuse for being so outmoded in its playability.  3 years ago this game would have knocked my socks off.  Now it comes across as too little to late and so much wasted potential.	-1
This game is most similar to Serious Sam than any other game I can think of except whereas SS is mainly in large open spaces with hundreds of opponents, this one is more commonly in large rooms with dozens of opponents. That's OK - it's pretty much what I expected.  But what I don't like is the way you have no way to stack items except to repeatedly hit them randomly until they fall the way you want them. Then you better quick save because as soon as you try to jump on them they'll fall down and you'll have to start again. All the surfaces except the floor seem very slippery and moving on them is another exercise in frustration. I quit at the military base because I didn't spend $20 to waste 30 minutes randomly hitting tanks to stack them up so I could move on.  Most of the secret locations and holy items are almost impossible to reach unless you are prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of time on it. I'm not - I have a life - and it doesn't include this stupid game.	-1
You gotta be kidding me... This is why I threw my DOOM game away! All this game is about mindless shooting! No plot to the game at all, just run around and kill things! Hey! I LOVE FPS but this is ridiculous! This is the first game I've bought in a LONG time that isn't worth the money. Oh sure, the graphics are ok, even a bit spooky, but geez, gimme a break! It must've been designed for mindless gamers without any other purpose other than to shoot things... What a waste! You go from one level to the next, mindlessly shooting creatures. Over and over and over again... Don't waste your money! Buy Far Cry. It's by far the best game out so far...	-1
[Boot-Crash,Boot-Crash...] Its the Painkiller Polka! That's what happened after I installed this mess. I knew that I was in trouble when the package contained 3 CDs and there was a message on the box stating: "Whoops, we messed up, use CD #3 to start the game, not #1...Duh." Uh-Oh!! And of course, after installing this game, then downloading the patch (ALREADY, the developers have a patch? Why doesn't Dreamcatcher just finish testing the game before they start selling it??) the darned thing still doesn't work. Worse yet, its an exception that is not handled since there is no error message: Just "Boot" then "Crash"! I know what you are thinking: "Well, you must have a bad system, it works fine on my machine." First, I have over 300 games loaded on my PC - from Microsoft Pinball to Dead Man's Hand - and they all work. I have the latest version of DirectX loaded and my video card is an 128 MB ATI 9000 series, my sound card is an Audigy 2 and my computer has a Gig of RAM and it is a P4 2.5 Ghz. But that really isn't the point. I expect a complete game when I plunk down some serious $$ for one; not some patched-up mess. I shouldn't have to rebuild my entire PC to run this game when over 300 others (including games released in the same month as "Painkiller") work perfectly. This is just a sloppily slapped-together piece of code. Don't waste your time on it until they fix ALL the bugs.	-1
Alright I haven't played this game for more than two hours, but felt the need to save some others some money and put my opinion in for what it's worth. Good news: if you STILL play doom 1 and 2, then THIS is your game! You'll probley think it's game of the year material. Bad news:  if your not in the doom 1 and 2 group, you're probley gonna HATE this game.  I'm in the hate group. There is no great gameplay here, no AI, no inspiring level design, it's not scary.  There's enough pretty graphics to make nice screenshots to sell the game. Mainly it's just shoot collect stuff and move on to next area gameplay.  Boring.  The monsters just spawn then run at you.  You just run upto them and take them out point blank with a shotgun.  It's hard to even get hurt in this game, the main thing that will hurt you is the collaterial damage from the explosives that "just happen" to be laying around the map right in your projectile path. My recommendation is download the demo, and if you think the demo is the most awesome gameplay you've seen they buy it. But don't buy this game without trying the demo! This game ran at top speed on my system:  AMD 2800+, Radeon 9800 PRO 256, 512 Ram. There's nothing spectacular to look at, so my guess is it will probley run at top speed on a majority of systems out there.	-1
ok. Most of us expect some cliches when playing a FPS. It's part of the genre, fair enough, but there is no excuse for unispired level design, creatures, lame enemy A.I. and boring game play. Do the graphics look nice? Sure. Is the sound decent? It's ok. It won't scare the wits out of you like System Shock 2 or Doom, but it'll do. Is it fun? Absloutely not. Most of the attacks can be avoided by side stepping (strafing). The enemy is far from engaging and the levels have a rehashed "boring been there done that" feel to them ...	-1
This game is an absolute insult to the gaming capabilities of the xbox. Graphics - on par with a second grade PS One game. Ambience - Repetitive sounds and lack of sound control (crouching produces as much foot-noise as walking) destroy any hopes of creating any element of suspense. AI - rather read as AS for Artificial Stupidity. Controls - they work well (hence the single star). Overall, I recommend that if you are looking for a FPS, save your money and wait for the releases of Ghost Recon (Island Thunder) or Medal of Honor (Rising Sun).	-1
Let me start off by saying what everyone else is generally saying about this game: the graphics [are bad]. The graphics are about as good as the old playstation 1. The characters and environments look blocky and lack any detail. The graphics are so bad they even make the game difficult - it's hard to tell which direction you're going because everything starts to look the same. The gameplay is mediocre. Running seems slow and awkward, rather than speedy and fluid. The gunfire is interesting - the weapons really kick, so aiming is more realistic. Otherwise SOF plays just about like any other first person shooter. This game is touted for its "realistic" weapons damage. Hitting different parts of enemies' bodies results in different body parts being blown off. Call me crazy, but I don't think sadistic violence can make up for a poorly designed and executed game. At any rate, you have to be really close to even notice, so it's not a big deal. Overall, this game is so bad, I regret spending the five bucks just to rent it!	-1
First off, let me say I ONLY play first-person shooters.  Suffice to say, I have an experience base for this review. The game play is absolutely horrible: There is no such thing as sniping in this game (yes, I know there are sniper weapons). Even when you do get off a clear shot, any obstruction within a few feet will block the bullets trajectory. The graphics are horrible: I rank this up there with Super Nintendo in terms of realism and pixelation. Most absurd is that you can be literally standing on top of an enemy and not even know it. Other things to consider, especially if you enjoy the fluidity of games like Halo:  Your player is slow, the enemy is fast. Your weapons are unexciting, aiming is impossible, so you are relegated to the good 'ole fashioned bumb rush attack. Loading and saving are annoyingly slow. I recommend you skip this and save your money for Halo when it comes out next year.  Sorry Activision, try again.	-1
This is a long playing shooter with very poor graphics and average sound.  If you like shooters you might like this and it might be worth it for 20 bucks, but if you haven't played ghost recon, halo, etc use the money on them and see what the xbox can do.  This game might be alright for playstation II users but it doesn't really make the cut on xbox.	-1
This is another PC ported game that is a complete miss. Like some PC ports that end up on the XBOX,they are better than the PC version but not with Soldier Of Fortune 2. This game looks bad graphically and plays terrible with lousy AI. There is no excuse the XBOX is far capilable of more and this is unexcusable game,I thought the PC verison Soldier Of Fortune 2 was bad but this port is worse. However the ported game does get rid of the annoying fog issue like the stupid PC title,so that is one positive. BOTTOM LINE:NOT EVEN WORTH A RENTAL,BUT AS FAR AS BUYING SAVE UP FOR QUALITY GAMES[HALO,DOA3,NINJA GAIDEN,SOUL CALIBUR 2,HALO 2(MID 2004),DOA 4(TBA)]	-1
Super bummed out about this. I guess a brand new PSX game of such notoriety for such a low price should have been a red flag. In my gut, I knew something wasn't right.  This is not an authentic PSX game. It is a bootleg with a traditional silver CD backing, versus the OG trademark black PlayStation disc. The case is right (except "Square Enix" instead of "Squaresoft"), the manual is right, everything is included and the game, for whatever reason, works, at least on an original US PlayStation console. These are the English version of the games, though I don't know if they will play all the way through, yet--I will update when/if I am able to beat them.   All-in-all, I'm not really satisfied. I feel dirty. The seller and Amazon are profiting off of pirated software... no bueno.	-1
Back in the day games were difficult and these are no exception. Without some sort of guide to walk you through it, you could spend hours racking your head against the wall because the game is so vague about things that you don't know where to go or what to do. Not the best story, either.	-1
Final Fantasy I & Final Fantasy II are nothing special to me. They are very primative, made in 2D. Final Fantasy II is a lot better in it's origanal form on "Super Nintendo". Also the story lines are different in those two versions. It,s for little kids.	-1
It pains me. Only when all nine planets are in perfect alignment is it possible for me to hate a Square-Enix game. For the game to come from the much-loved Final Fantasy franchise, there has to be a lunar and solar eclipse at the same time. Anyone's heard the story right? Square was a struggling developer back in the eighties facing bankrupty. They made a RPG styled after Dragon Quest, Japan's top-selling RPG, which turned into a mega-hit, saving the company and launching one of the most revered videogame series ever.  It's strange that I never played Final Fantasy when it first came out on NES. I know that my family owned the cartridge, but I'd never played it. I figured that the first game would be something special. Final Fantasy to me has always been the epic stories, the memorable characters, and the solid gameplay mechanics. Those were the qualities that just enthralled me when I became hooked on Final Fantasy II (the 4th one really) for the SNES. Unfortunately, the story is barely there and the characterization is nil. You are a band of heroes that is plopped down in a medival fantasy world and given the task of restoring the four crystals which will save the world. That's it. Most of the time you are wandering about aimlessly, trying to figure out where you are supposed to go. The method of exploration is go into cave, if monsters kill you in one hit, leave cave and find another. There are some towns you can visit and be treated to wonderful dialogue like "Bless the Crystal!" only thing half the idiots in this world say.  If that weren't frustrating enough, this is a really hard game. Unfortunately, the difficulty feels like it comes from poor game design than actually being meant to challenge you. Perpare to spend tons of time leveling up. You'll be attacked often, after one or two steps sometimes, the monsters appear in droves, and your attacks will miss as much as they hit. In dungeons, there are no save points for you to save and restore your health with a tent. The healing items and magic is woefully inadequate most of the time. The magic system is also messed up. Instead of having magic points to use as you please, Magic is divided into 8 levels and you can buy 3 spells from each level. You can only use magic from each level a certain number of time. This annoying because by the time you reach level ten most of the low level spells are practically obsolete but you'll have tons of them and few higher level spells. There are also no items to revive fallen party members, so you have to leave the dungeon, track back to town, and get a priest to revive you. This is really annoying when the town doesn't have a priest and you have to go halfway around the world to find one.  I managed to play for 10 hours before I could stand no more. Final Fantasy II is a little better. You play as a group of youths fighting for a rebel resistance movement. The characters have personalities and the game actually gives you missions to accomplish. However, I didn't like the leveling system. Depending on how you fight, your stats increase and decrease accordingly. You'd think that would have the characters highly customizable? Wrong! The characters are still inclined towards certain jobs and weapon types. Maria has low HP and can't hit the broad side of a barn, so she has to be a mage. Give her a javeline instead of her bow and arrow and some animals will have gone extinct before she lands another hit. It takes forever to get the stats to increase.  The presentation of the games are pretty good. The graphics and spell effects are bright and attractive. The music is still exceptional. If you loved Final Fantasy I when it first came out and have been itching to play it again, ignore this review and buy this right away. These games have never looked better and they come will a host of unlockable extras. For everyone else looking to play the RPGs are yesteryear, get Final Fantasy Chronicles or Anthology, as Square has perfected the formula for RPGs by then.  Final Fantasy Origins is a relic of a long-ago era in gaming that has aged like Buddy Hackette. It's a definitely a historic benchmark for the industry, but for me it's only novelty is that it shows that "You've come along way, Baby!"	-1
Okay, let me start by saying I'm the biggest FF fan in the world. No question.  But this game was like all old and {edited} and stuff. Nothing near the greatness that is FINAL FANTASY 7. The graphics are all terrible, nothing like FF7's. Did they think us super fans wouldn't notice how terrible this was if they just put two terrible games in the package? Shame on you Square. I don't know how I'm ever going to forgive you...	-1
I am a wantonly unforgiving being; so as I sifted through the muck of Amazon's weirder side, I came across this relic. Recalling my "experience" with this game, I cracked my knuckles (no pun intended you nerd) and got to some salty typing. As with all Sonic games, it is just a matter of how much it sucks. This one, my dears, excels in that aspect. If you gave a cutting edge team ten-million euros and told them to make the worst game they could, it could never approach the unfocused imbecility that is this game. It is well known that if you try to fail, it often shows. Here, we can enjoy the steamy pile that is a failed attempt at success. So bad is this game, that I am surprised it isn't mentioned along the same lines as "Waterloo", "The Invasion of Russia", and "Donald Trump's Hairpiece". The endless repetition and plotless fever-dream vibe aside, we can focus on the characters. Because I hate them. Sonic is either too slow or too twitchingly fast to control. Tails is just kinda...Tails. Knuckles does a weird floating thing. (Like Echidnas are known for) And Amy...Oh, Amy. She misrepresents woman-kind as a hopeless fanatic of her dear Sonic, despite the fact he has as much personality as a Chili Dog, and the same depth as a modern Shyamalan film. (Perhaps a snide remark about Sonic Fans?) Big the Cat suffers from an advanced form of brain damage, and his "Froggy" quests are more broken then Gorbachev's Perestroika. Oh, yeah- the robot sucks too. Should you fork over the pecuniary assets necessary to buy this...thing-you are in for the biggest flustercluck since Bubsy 3D wooed Superman 64. Is this game bad? Yes. In the same way Ebola is "bad." Or your parachute failing to open. Or having to take down a portrait from the family wall. Or listening to a child cry. Or writing reviews for this sodding heap. It is bad, my dear. If my review inspires interest, I apologize. War-Journalists rarely advocate joining the cause- neither do I recommend trying this for your masochistic purposes. Please, let the Sonic Franchise be exorcised from amongst us; and try not to play this. Unless you already own it, in which case-Heaven help you.	-1
The disc was too scratched to play, it doesn't read past the first level and gives an error message	-1
I remember playing this on the Dreamcast back in the day as well as the second in the series.  I sold the Dreamcast when they stopped making them and stopped making games for the system to purchase another system of some kind at the time.  I regretted never finishing the game completely and really liked the Sonic Adventure games.  This turd is not the original game it once was however!  I would think that re-releasing a game on a newer platform should IMPROVE the title, but apparently Sonic team didn't see improvement as absolutely necessary.  The camera is wonky and the controls aren't nearly as smooth as they were with the Dreamcast's controller.  The graphics have not been improved much if any at all, and the one thing a sonic game has going for it, speed, gets interrupted frequently because of the twitchy controls forcing you to get stuck on a wall in the middle of a big loop or something and you go from 60-0 suddenly.  If you have never played the original on the Dreamcast, then this may be worth a rent if you really really must play it, but keep in mind that the original was a groundbreaking eye-popping fun experience and this barely passes as fun!  If  you ever played the Dreamcast version, there is nothing significantly different here, so don't waste your money.	-1
I had this game when it was first realeased on the Sega Dreamcast and at the time i was excited about the prospect of playing a 3D Sonic game. And then i played Sonic Adventure, oh and what a mess it was. You would think with the awsome power of the Gamecube Sega would have made some small attempt to improve all the awful bugs from the original Dreamcast version. Well they ait done a single thing, it's still a mess. The 3D camera is still as bad as it was on Dreamcast and all other bugs that annoyed me at the time are still in there. Everything about this game is just awful, the music, the terrible voice acting and lets no forget Big the Cat. Get Mario Sunshine or if you need Sonic that badly then get the Mega Collection instead avoid this rubbish.	-1
Some games frusterate you, some games make you happy, I don't know what it was about this game, but I got the sensation of both. Oh well, here's my review of Sonic Adventure DX:  Sonic, Sonic, Sonic, what would we do without you?Well, I don't know, but I know some of you can do without this game. Bad voice overs, dated graphics and frustration, oh my! Yeah, whatever...  Graphics=6/10  I've never played the DreamCast version, but from what I've heard, they look exactly the same. Now this is great if you're looking for that classic look, but it would be great to see some enhanced visuals here. Come on!  Another thing that bugs me(and it goes for pretty much every 3-D Sonic game)is that every character is way too shiny! Sonic, Tails, Knuckles--they're all shiny! Animals are not shiny! I know this isn't a very big deal, but it just looks weird.  Controls:7/10  Sometimes, the controls are great, but other times, all you have to do is push the analog stick forward for about half of the levels. I need something more interesting.  Gameplay:4/10  Most (not including 2-D sidescrolling) Sonic games have the worst camera ever. You're running along, then all of a sudden, there's a wall in your face.  Also, the game is way too hard! I don't know where to go or what to do half the time! Most of the hints they give you is:"Go to the (insert place) you might find something!"Whoop-dee-do, I might find something.  Music:6/10  No comment.  Replay value:3/10  When you're stuck, the best resorce is the Word Wide Web. But I'm too lazy to go on the internet to find some stupid hint for some stupid game. After I get stuck, and try to figure it out numerous times, I give up. It's just not fun for me anymore.  Overall:4/10  MAKE A NEW SONIC GAME FOR GOD'S SAKE!I'm sick of all these remakes, nobody has any innovative ideas anymore. Sonic Heroe's is a step up, but that's just one game. One game out of all the amazing minds working at Sega, you made Nights, I want something interesting again.	-1
yeah thats what isaid back in '99 when it first came out. now when i bought it again hoping for a nice little trip down memory lane I was like "HOW MUCH DID I PAY FOR THIS!!!?!?!?!" yeah not good. there isn't even a multiplayer mode on it. and the chao system isn't even half as advanced as the one in SA2Battle. the framerate is worse than it was back on dreamcast. i gave it a 1 but i wish i could have gone lower. its outdated poo. but hey if you actually want to play through all the boring challenges and stuff you can unlock....drum roll please. GAME GEAR GAMES!!!! oh yeah and they are really aweful as well. so yeah the only thing that I think this game has going for it is its pretty box art. other than that...stay away please. if you wanna spend $40 on a sonic game, pick up the Mega Collection. those games a fun.	-1
Sonic Adventure DX is supposed to be a nearly identical copy of the Sega Dreamcast title, Sonic Adventure, but something drastic has been lost in its translation to the GameCube.  This game is severely lacking the feel of its Dreamcast version and, on top of that, it seems to be full of glitches. The first flaw most players will notice are the very akward camera angles.  In this version of the game, players have very little control over the game's camera and, as a result, will often have their characters suffer death from an unseen enemy or pit. The second flaw players will likely notice are the glitches in the game's platforms.  While progressing through certain levels, players can suddenly find their characters falling through floors and walls that *should* be solid and impermeable.  (The passability glitches in the floors and walls always occur in the same places, so players *can* avoid them once learning where they are.) If you are willing to deal with the frustration of frequent, random character death, then you might find this game to be a lot of fun.  Otherwise, you should probably avoid it and find a good platform title elsewhere.	-1
Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut is, conceptually, a great idea. The game is among the blue hedgehog's finest, and the list of extra features is a Sonic fan's dream come true. Unfortunately, the execution looks and feels rushed, resulting in an unbalanced end product. As advertised, Sonic Adventure DX contains a slew of extras, like every Sonic game ever released on the Game Gear handheld, a brand-new Mission mode with 60 objectives, and Game Boy Advance connectivity options that let you raise Chao and unlock links for other GameCube Sonic games. Those are all cool features, but it's a different story when you get to the main portion of the game. The graphics have been polished with detailed textures, but the already problematic camera angles have gotten worse. The visuals also break up and have serious collision detection issues. These collision hiccups also adversely affect the controls, which otherwise feel good. The audio has been spiced up with a Dolby Pro Logic II option, which sounds great albeit a tad too loud. The dialogue is the same as in the Dreamcast version and is not intended to be as goofy as it sounds, but it's certainly not irritating. Who would have thought a few years ago that virtually every major Sonic game would be available on the GameCube? Sonic Adventure DX is a deeper, more interesting game than its sequel, but the camera and collision problems hurt the overall experience. Only recommended for serious Sonic enthusiasts and completists.	-1
There's many ways that Sonic's 3D games could be improved, unfortunately, Sega missed every one of them with this sad excuse for a quick-cash-game. Director's what? "DX" is basically exactly the same as "Sonic Adventure" for Dreamcast, but (as the promotional materials rave) "with extra features". I'm sorry, but "classic" Game Gear Sonic games and some more of those insanely difficult "beat the level in 2 minutes" missions isn't anything worth adding. Am I the only one that realizes that Game Gear had NO CLASSICS? That's why it failed! I can understand how GameCube owners who haven't played the original "SA" would like this, but seriously, when you already own the game and have beat it, why buy it again for some stupid features, unnecessary missions, and more of that Chao garbage? Graphical improvements? No. From the screenshots I've seen, it has only one graphical improvement: the toes of Sonic's shoes are now rounded. Oh, wow...	-1
Normally It would take me DAYS to complete Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo and was expecting the GBA version to take just as long but no instead I BEAT THE GAME IN ONE WHOLE AFTERNOON!! It's just too easy compared to the SNES version, so overall Don't buy this, get A SNES with this game instead.	-1
Not exactly.  I was a die-hard fan of Donkey Kong Country when it came out for the SNES, and I had hoped that this game would be a re-release of the same game for new fans to enjoy.  It's not.  This is why, more or less, the grade is so low.  I loved that old SNES game to death.  I think I may have loved it a little TOO much, however, because I waited several days before actually entering my name to play it.  Why?  Because although I turned the game on the very first day, the absence of that wonderful image of Cranky with the phonograph made me realize I wasn't back in Kansas, so to speak.  Yes, you may get some kicks out of this game if you're a new gamer.  Yes, you may find it amusing if you were a casual fan of the original, but for an orthadox Kong-aholic like me, I just don't reccomend it.	-1
This game could have been a great game had bethesda finished it. I am sure that they were pressed for time but to release a defective product there is no excuse! they should have recalled the game. insted ,all they did was issue an e-mail to stores to expect returns. and even if you follow the step by step instructions from the bethesda site on how to keep the game from freezing or reseting it does not work, believe me I tried many times! the game is rather fun when it's not malfunctioning however it becomes quiet irritating when you have been at sea for an hour sinking ships only to see your game freeze!!! arggghhh!!! so i could not take it any more and returned the game back to the store for a full refund.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ALL OF THEM ARE DEFECTIVE!!!!  SHAME ON YOU BETHESDA SOFTWORKS!!!	-1
It seems to me that the programmers were rushed to finish this game in order to release at the same time as the movie (which has nothing to do with the game other than ships and pirates).I encountered many bugs(crashes) as i reached higher levels and obtained larger ships.   The dungeons are intolerable there is basically no reason to go into them and theres no auto mapping feature  so you don't know what way youve been and then the skeleton regenerate  so you may fight the same skeletons over and over.   Theres also lots of pointless jungle areas with nothing to explore. they just waste your time and make you run ( more like a geritall jog)through them.   The game is way too short and the end is a major let down. I was actually stunned to find that i had gotten to the end of the game so quickly (15 hrs of game play). Perhaps if you do all of the side adventures it may bring you up to 20-25hrs max unless you are completely inept and die constantly without saving you games regularly.   Also the character is very limited in movement. he walks jogs and swings a sword . He can not jump!!!!   The good thing in the game is the sea battles they really did a fantastic job in this respect the whole thing is excellent in this respect with the minor exception of when you control your own guns and have the enemy in front of you on the larger ships you cant see the enemy because the sails screen them out .   overall i found pirates black kat much more enjoyable and even along the same lines when it came to the sea battles but far more enjoyable to explore and way more stable to play.	-1
Imagine if they made Romeo and Juliet 2, and they had Romeo and Juliet come back to life and live happily ever after.  Now you know what Final Fantasy X-2 is all about. Now that I know how FFX-2 turns out, I don't have need to keep my original FFX copy that I always thought of as a classic treasure.  FFX had a definite ending, and realistically it was about one thing, a tragic romance.  When FFX-2 was announced, I think it was obvious how it would turn out, and it does turn out that way.  I was a bit surprised that the developers of the game where this predictable.  I kept telling myself, something else has to happen, it can't turn out like a Disney fairytale, but deep down inside I think I knew it. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned I just needed confirmation that this was true, so that I wouldn't waste my time playing the game.  I don't think I'll ever play another Final Fantasy game again.  The Final Fantasy train stops here.	-1
Back when SquareSoft was still an up and coming developer with a reputation for putting out consistently stellar titles, they adhered to a simple rule in developing new entries of its Final Fantasy series: *No Direct Sequels.* Sure, there were a slew of common elements that crossed over from game to game -- the play style, the aesthetic, plot themes, recurring motifs, weapons and spells, enemies, etc. -- but no new Final Fantasy game was ever built as a continuation of a previous one. Each new Final Fantasy's story, world, and characters (give or take a Gilgamesh) were designed to be exclusive and limited to that game, which was made to stand as a complete work in itself. If people clamored for an elaboration on somebody's backstory or wanted to know what happened to Cecil or Terra after they saved the world, it was up to the fanfiction and doujinshi hacks to provide it. Square was too busy creating new worlds to continue dwelling in their old ones.  One of the reasons snobs like me (re: overeducated and underemployed) tend to be so violently dismissive of sequels in books and film is because they're just too easy. It takes a considerable amount of time and sweat to create, out of nothing, a fully-formed cast of characters, a world for them to inhabit, and the complete story of the crisis that will define their lives. Most people can't do it, or can't do it well. But it takes a whole lot less work to take an old story, wind up the crank, and get it moving again (which is incidentally why fanfiction and doujin have so many practitioners).  Even though Square produced sequel after sequel, they were actually pretty bold in how they went about doing it. In addition to its steadfast refusal to listen to character-obsessive fans' demands for more of the same, Square earned international renown for reinventing what Final Fantasy was from game to game. Whereas rival developer Enix clung to a very specific formula in making its Dragon Quest games, SquareSoft liked taking risks. Final Fantasy II was a console RPG that completely nixed experience points and character levels (in 1987!). In designing Final Fantasy VI, Square brushed aside seven years of lighthearted medieval fantasy predecessors to present an apocalyptic steampunk saga with an aesthetic inspired by the European Renaissance and industrial revolution. VII ventured into cyberpunk territory during a time when RPGs were mostly rooted in basic swords n' sorcery settings, and carried with it something extremely rare in video games back then: overt social commentary. And Final Fantasy VIII -- well, regardless of how much anyone likes or dislikes VIII, it's practically a checklist of flaunted console RPG conventions.  But in 2001, SquareSoft took a risk and lost big. Enter Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the failed experiment of a movie that cost SquareSoft $98,000,000. This is not a loss anyone can walk away from easily, even a powerhouse like Square.  The instant success of Kingdom Hearts in 2002 must have come as a relief, but Square was still hurting. It would still be a few years until a Kingdom Hearts II could start generating wealth, Final Fantasy XII was stuck in a developmental purgatory, and the corporate brass was still wrangling with Enix over merger details. Square needed a quick, easy way to make money. These were desperate times... and desperate times call for direct sequels.  Like anyone crossing over to the dark side for the first time, I imagine the folks at Square must have been astounded at how incredibly easy it was putting together Final Fantasy X-2. The story was already 80% written, considering how there was no need to pay a brain trust of artists and writers to design an original fantasy world and its history from scratch. There was likewise no need to pump tens of millions into a budget towards programming and map design, since virtually all the areas from X could just be recycled and thrown into X-2 as they were. (In order to keep from looking completely cheap and lazy, they did design three attractive new areas, expanded a few old ones, and whipped up some simple textures for a handful of assorted unimportant "branching paths and dead ends" dungeons that could be assembled with your most basic level editor software.) The character models and animations? Recycled from X. Monster models and animations? Recycled from X. Battle effects animations? As many as possible recycled from X. Battle system? Well, rehashing X's might have been too obvious, so they went ahead and used a bootleg, watered-down version of Grandia's instead. And as for the practical considerations, they probably reckoned they could amp up sales amongst female gamers if all of X-2 featured all-female player characters, and they could do it without scaring off male consumers as long as Yuna and her friends showed a lot of skin. It's equally likely that Yuna's redesign was implemented with Lara Croft's enduring popularity in the overseas market in mind. And it probably wasn't until a bit later that they decided to additionally feature her in glamorous pop performance sequences that would lend themselves to television ads and soundtrack sales, and increase the game's overall marketability, since glitzy commercial pop was huge on both sides of the Pacific.  Final Fantasy X-2 began development in early 2002 and was released in Japan in March of 2003. It has sold somewhere in the neighborhood of four million copies worldwide, and has 86% and 85% rankings on Game Rankings and Metacritic. IGN gives it a 9.5, calling it "brilliant and addictive" and praising Square for "finally beginning to listen to the outcries of its fans" and producing a direct sequel, while Gamespot calls X-2 "every bit as poignant, endearing, and engrossing as its forebears." The now-defunct Official U.S. Playstation Magazine evidently gave it 10 out of 10 -- a perfect score.  Critics. What do they know?  ~THE STORY~  Every opening to every Final Fantasy game more or less epitomizes the whole experience following it. Final Fantasy X-2, sadly, is no exception. The truest mark of Square Stockholm Syndrome is buying X-2, saying "what in God's name was that?" at the intro, and still deciding to go ahead and give the rest of the game a shot. Fans of Final Fantasy X might already be complaining that throwing a pop concert for a throng of adoring fans is tremendously out of character for X's vestal heroine -- but hold the phone! The Yuna we see onstage is actually her sneaky rival Leblanc, who has stolen her garment grid and is posing as Yuna to throw a sold-out pop concert and smear her image in the public eye.  ...  Anyway, so after Rikku and Paine chase Leblanc around a while, our modest, clergy-raised priestess Yuna finally shows up to set the record straight and prove she hasn't sold out by backflipping onto the scene in a halter top and hot pants and unloading a few clips into her rivals' faces. Sass is exchanged, poses are struck, Yuna reclaims her garment grid, and she and her buddies victoriously return to their airship.  Nowadays, Yuna is running with the Al-Bhed side of her extended family. Calling themselves the Gullwings, they travel Spira's skies in Brother's souped-up flying eyesore and scour the world for spheres, the home movies of the ancients. See, at the end of Final Fantasy X International, Yuna discovers a sphere containing a video of someone who looks and sounds exactly like her vaporized boyfriend and wants to see if she can find more information about him. Secure in the belief that her beloved blonde beau still out there somewhere alive and whining, Final Fantasy X's heroine, dons her hot pants, halter top and combat boots, grabs a pair of pistols, and embarks on a quest for the truth with all the sass, charm, and you-go-girl power she can muster.  Since Final Fantasy X-2 gives you the airship right from the get-go, the first chapter consists of tracking down new spheres and stopping by familiar locations from X to how Spira's changed over the last two years. The first sphere is in Besaid, where you can catch up with two of Yuna's old party members (gothic superbabe Lulu and her pudgy, sports coach bumpkin of a husband Wakka). Sphere number two is in Zanarkand, where you can watch Yuna and Rikku yell at Cid for turning the ruins (formerly the single most remote and sacred location on the planet) into a tourist attraction. If you care enough, you can also swing by Gagazet and visit Kimahri, who rules over the Ronso tribe by standing around with his arms crossed and making limp pronouncements in slow, broken English.  Even though Final Fantasy X-2's main plot and characters are a bust, its subtext can actually be sort of interesting. The game's world is a familiar one, as it revisits Spira after the end of Sin, the fall of Yevon, and the rise of technology; but it was also designed with this world in mind. In spite of their best efforts, X-2's developers do show some cleverness in designing a fantasy world that appears more and more like our own the more we explore it.  At the end of Final Fantasy X, Spira managed to pull itself out of a thousand-year dark age by casting off religion and destroying the planet-ravaging monster Sin for good. Two years later, society is fragmented, leaderless, and entering the nascent stages of a rapid technological revolution that's already having unintended consequences. The people aren't quite sure what to do with themselves now that they're not constantly fleeing for their lives and rebuilding their destroyed villages every other week. The former Yevon faithful are struggling to find meaning in their lives now that their religion has been pretty much completely debunked -- and most of them are finding it in consumerism and hedonism. Also, the forests are dying, the ice is melting, and the music everyone listens to sucks.   Does any of this sound maybe a little familiar to anyone? No?   Perhaps I read too much into things.   In any event, Final Fantasy X-2 would be a vastly improved experience if it were more like Final Fantasy I in conveying its story. Were all the character-driven melodrama slashed and burned, leaving the player to explore and figure out the game's world on their own, X-2 might not be so unrelentingly irritating. Unfortunately, since we do have to cope with the aforementioned character-driven melodrama, the weak plot, and the dozens of piddling subplots tied to the dozens of piddling sidequests in order to get a picture of what's going on in Spira, the disparate interesting bits are really just the sprig of parsley on a giant dollop of grease.  ~THE GAME~ "yah the story's not so good but the gameplay is pretty alright"  I've read a number of different reviews and articles concerning this game that all tend to contain some variation of the above sentence. Sure, X-2 might be the hot springs episode of the Final Fantasy series, but it also features a brand new iteration of the job system. As long as the character building and battle systems are about on par with the Final Fantasy V, which was great fun to play in spite of its lightweight story, doesn't X-2 deserve the same kind of credit?  First, some words on the new battle and job systems. X-2 is back to using the old ATB system, but it also mixes in some elements from the Grandia games. Characters' and enemies relatives locations on the screen are more important than before: a character with a melee job will attack more quickly if her target is closer, and certain special attacks have a range of effect that additional targets can duck out of, provided they're far enough away from the main target. It sounds neat, but since there are so few of these attacks and there's no way to move characters aside from using the "fight" command, this mechanic rarely makes any significant difference in battle. Also borrowed from Grandia is the purple "wait time" bar, a new ATB gauge function. When a party member or enemy uses a special attack, there is a buffer period between when the ability is selected and its activation. This means that abilities are no longer instantaneous; they can be interrupted and delayed. But while Grandia's system is specially structured around this mechanic, X-2 seems to have just tacked it on mid-development, and it usually doesn't make much of a difference in anything. (For example, the Alchemist's charge time for her Stash command is tremendous, and she's still the game's most useful healbot. Likewise, the Warrior and Samurai's attack-delaying abilities are virtually useless.)  And we have the new job system. Final Fantasy X-2 doesn't call them jobs, though -- I guess because that would be too unglamorous, too evocative of dirty fingernails. Instead, our teen girl squad equips "dresspheres", which change their clothes and thereby alter their special abilities. There's no mixing and matching abilities between outfits like in V or Tactics (barring the use of special accessories or garment grids), but X-2's spin on the job system is that it allows the girls to switch dresspheres in mid-battle, resulting in sparkly and glamorous Sailor Moon-esque transformation sequences (whose twenty-second lengths can thankfully be abridged or cut altogether through an option in the config menu). There are fourteen dresspheres in all, and X-2 does a commendable job of balancing them by setting their number of learnable abilities at fifteen (though there are a few loopholes).  Sounds great, right? But the truth is, this is all just the setup for another hilarious SquareEnix designer joke. The punchline is that Final Fantasy X-2 really wants you to participate in as few battles as possible. Whereas the earlier job-based game Final Fantasy V (heck, and Final Fantasy X for that matter) bombards players with a multitude of difficult and tricky fights, X-2 would rather we spend the bulk of our time watching cutscenes and playing minigames than doing those things that Final Fantasy X-2's exciting what's-it-called system was designed for. Unless you really go out of your way -- and X-2 rather expects you to, judging by the preponderance of minigames and sidequests -- you're not really going to be doing that much fighting (except when you're battling Leblanc's goofy henchmen, Logos and Ormi, over and over and over and over and over again during the first two chapters).  Most of the time when you swoop over a location on the world map and accept a mission, someone approaches Yuna and drafts her into putting on a moogle suit and selling balloons to tourists. Or selling concert tickets to tourists hanging around the river. Or approaching NPCs and trying to guess the correct sales pitch that will compel them to go to one of the Calm Lands' two amusement park companies. Or chasing butterflies. Or chasing chocobos. Or chasing British people. If you're not selling something or chasing something, you're fighting sequential battles against clusters of human opponents that drop after two hits. (And sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll get to fight sequential battles against packs of the same three or four basic monsters in different configurations.) Then you watch a cutscene you might as well skip, get an item, and board the airship to search out more fun.  At least there's the Via Infinito, Chapter 5's huge optional dungeon: a hundred randomly-generated maps of unavoidable random battles and boss fights every twenty levels. The deeper you go, the harder it gets. Of course, in order to finish it, you'll need to grind your way up to around level 80 (at least). And you'll need to spend a bunch of extra hours stealing and bribing and getting enough amusement park points to stockpile all the items you'll need to see you through floors 80-100 and the last few superbosses. You know, you might as well just go ahead and finish the game so you can come back to the Via Infinito during New Game+. I couldn't bring myself to try, but I'm told it's totally worth all the time and trouble -- and it's required if you want to get the good ending.  There's also Sphere Break, X-2's incarnation of the collectible, number-based Triple Triad and Tetra Master card games from Final Fantasy VIII and IX. What are the rewards for playing and mastering Sphere Break? Well, beating Shinra -- the toughest player in the game -- is the only way to acquire the gambler job. Aside from that? Well, that depends on whether you consider the thrill of spending hours digging around in the desert for more game spheres and playing the same group of NPCs in the same location a reward in itself. You don't? Boy are you behind the times.  Oh, and blitzball is back. Did I mention that blitzball is back? It is.  I don't even know what else to say here. I really can't think of a single reason beyond the Job System why anyone should ever play Final Fantasy X-2. It's surely the most incoherent Square game I've ever played -- the thing just can't decide what it wants to be. It wants to have a strong central plot, but is designed so that the bulk of the experience consists of optional little sidequests with optional little subplots. It wants the player to enjoy its exciting and well-designed (if not in need of a little polishing) battle system, but the game is built so that the player has to spend all his time participating in a variety of inane minigames instead. It wants to be lighthearted and somber, comedic and bittersweet all at once, and the designers just weren't capable of succeeding in that sort of balancing act -- especially considering how short a development cycle they were working with. (One year. The last Final Fantasy game that took only a year to develop was V, on the Super Famicom.) None of Square's work from the last decade or so has been very consistent, but Final Fantasy X-2 is something else. You'd almost suspect the corporate brass had it slapped together, crammed full of fanservice, and shipped out quickly as possible to help offset some huge financial deficit or something. At any rate, if you wanted to identify the Final Fantasy game that pinpoints, closely as possible, the period when Square finally and iredeemably "sold out," X-2 would be it.  And so I leave you with one final fun fact: Final Fantasy X-2's director, Motomu Toriyama, is also the director and scenario writer for Final Fantasy XIII. Hmm.	-1
I like it but it stops past a certain point in the game which prevents me from moving on. It is complete game fresh and not bad shape decent quality and was very much running fine but i don't what happened though so i stopped playing it.	-1
This is by far the worst FF game that I have ever played. Whoever wrote the leveling, item distribution, and currency script needs to be shot. This is the only FF game as far as I know that you'll recieve ethers for winning a battle. I have literally recieved up to 8 Hi-potions at the end of a battle. I think it was around 30 or 40 hours of playtime when I capped at level 99 with everybody, and I really didn't even grind that much. I'm still on chapter 5 with over 400,000 gil and literally nothing left to buy. Money and battling is completely useless to me now, and at level 99 I'm still getting decimated by some random encounter that's pretty much impossible to beat unless you get some key item from the storyline. So I'm stuck between searching every level for a number of hidden cactaurs that could be anywhere, or forcing myself to sit through a stupid AI controlled blitzball tournament just to progress the boring storyline. Not that I couldn't complete the game, but why would I want to? Moving on.	-1
This game offers an experience very different from the original Final Fantasy X, and I didn't really like it. It's neat to take a break from the norm and collect dresspheres with which to change your outfit mid-combat so you can alter your abilities, but all of the abilities seem just there for looks. None of the strategic abilities really give you any advantages. You'd do fine just using the warrior dressphere with the attack command, as there's an insignificant number of enemies who resist physical attacks. Even the armored enemies from the first game go down easily to attack spam. Silence doesn't work on anything that casts magic, blind doesn't work on anything that uses physical attacks, and poison doesn't work on anything with high hit points. It's all useless fluff. And if you don't scour the game world for extra completion points before the end, you can easily wind up suddenly pitted against a world full of enemies far above your level, and the game can become unwinnable.	-1
It glitched up a lot. Couldnt play it. This copy did work but this is a great game. I love it. I would buy a good copy.	-1
Im going to make this simple, if your a traditional Final Fantasy fan who enjoyed Cecil, Bartz, Cloud, Zidane and all those great guys then skip on this game, its titled Final Fantasy but it completely strays from the path, the only positive is the graphics but the story and game play are awful	-1
Not really a fan. I don't like the dancing and singing especially in final fantasy collection. It is just not my idea of good final fantasy game.	-1
like ff8 you either like it or dont. i dont. this game is an embarrassment to the series. this is coming from a long time hardcore final fantasy fan--this game isn't that great.	-1
I read a lot of reviews on FF X-2, and though I love FF games, well lets say X-2 sucked and bad, and I am a female, and I though this game is not interesting. I gave the game back to game stop. FF X is a great game, but I don't know what happened in FF X-2.  There are a lot of stupid side quest, which I could not stand. It drove me nuts.  The game characters looked really weird in my opinion.  I didn't think the graphics were all the great, ok I guess, and the story line sucked. I did not enjoy the battle system.  I would highly recommend renting FF X-2, before you buy this game.	-1
I'll tell anyone with an ear what I think about this game... or 2 eyes to read my review. It is absolutely awful. Not only does it attempt to throw mud on everything that was great and original about FFX, but the scariest part is it almost succeeds!  For those who seem to love this game (preteens and anime geeks, I imagine), let's break it down the same way you all did, only this is strictly for those who like QUALITY game play, QUALITY characters, and above all, NO JAPANESE POP SONGS OR POP PRINCESSES!  Plot: Like being trapped in the worst anime and having to play as the characters in one excruciating scenario after another. Yuna, Rikku (most annoying character from the previous game makes a new appearance! Yay!), and emo girl Paine are now singing sensations in Spira! Nefarious villains seem to dislike your newfound pop success, and in a pointless quest for mundane spheres, cackle and plot in such over-dramatic form it would make the Wicked Witch of the West melt in embarrassment.  Characters: The aforementioned Yuna and Rikku have all their most annoying traits laid bare in this game. While you could forgive the sometimes weak dialog and annoying vocal talents of them in FFX, they don't have such sweet characters as Auron or Lulu to balance them. Emo girl Paine is hardly a good enough replacement. "Oh, I'm sulky and beautiful and the world doesn't understand me. I'm going to funnel my angst into my songs."  Gameplay: The biggest difference between FFX and its sequel is the reintroduction of classes, a much-beloved ability that allows characters to assume the roles of mages, gunslingers, swordsmen, and other useful roles. Not so in this game. You switch between them in battle, meaning you don't stick with one class for longer than a few monsters, meaning you never associate any character with any one class, meaning they become frivolous fast. And who the hell wants to be a "singer" in the middle of a battle? Oh, right, preteens and anime geeks.  Music: *gag*  Overall: The darkest hour in Final Fantasy history was when this game was released. It's a discredit to other games such as the masterful FFVIII that are given the same rating on Amazon as this one. If you buy it, I very much hope you are only buying it to melt it into unrecognizable plastic so it can be recycled. Otherwise you are encouraging this scatter-brained drivel to be reproduced in the future.	-1
I am female and purchased this game because I liked Final Fantasy X so much. This, however, is a very lame follow up. The fighting controls are very different and you have to fight fiends with song and dance. The story is very poor in comparison to X, and the entire game just feels half baked and childish.	-1
Where to start?  Sigh, just thinking about this game gets my blood boiling.  I can't for the life of me understand why some people are giving this 5 stars.  Well, first off, just let me say that I am female.  It should be glaringly obvious that this game is targeted towards a female audience (or so Square-Enix may believe).  Unfortuneately, I was sickened by this game.  Well, let's start with something good.  Graphics (10/10): Not bad at all.  I'm not too picky about graphics and I can honestly say that these are pretty good.  Bright, shiny, nice for a PS2 game.  Music (4/10): Honestly, this is a matter of opinion, but I didn't like the mix of jazz, techno and pop that made up this soundtrack.  The final fantasy series is known for its beautiful classical-style music, and this game is a huge departure from that.  The airship music made me want to turn off the sound and put a previous game's soundtrack into my cd player.  The only song I really liked was "A Thousand Words".  Characters (0/10): This section may even deserve a negative rating.  It's like Square-Enix decided to make a game just for the women out there-except they chose the top 10% of the female populous that were the most stupid, shallow, and air-headed people they could find for advice on what to put in this game.  This game gives real women a bad image.  Yuna, a mature, intelligent character I love from FF10, has been kidnapped and replaced with a body double who has the intellect of a card-board box covered in glitter.  I mourned the loss of the real Yuna.  FF10 Yuna grappled with such deep and complex issues as self-sacrifice and questioning her faith, FF10-2 Yuna likes playing dress-up and uses words like "dissasteriffic".  Honestly, the other two characters are no better; they are just as shallow and stupid.  I was actually excited about the all-female cast, I was expecting the intelligence-level of the female characters from FF10--not to be found here.  Story (1/10): Wow.  This story is vapid. It starts out promisingly enough-Yuna views a sphere of someone who looks like Tidus, and sets out to find out if the impossible task of ressurecting him can be accomplished. The rest of the story falls apart from there. The vast majority of this "story" is made up of mini-games and side-quests.  Now, I like sidquests and mini-games as much as the next person, but there's a reason they have the words "side" and "mini" in them.  They are supposed to take a back-burner to the main story.  In this game, it's the other way around: the main game is composed of one dull, uninteresting sidequest/mini-game after another, while the main storyline takes forever to emerge/develop.  By the time the main story finally got around to being focused on, I no longer cared.  Battle System (6/10): I had no real qualms with the actual battle mechanic. The system is a variation of turn based that is rather fast -- battles move quickly and your characters move around the field, helping you break out of the "let's all line up and attack" feel of previous games (which I actually didn't mind at all).  I must say that the Dress-sphere system itself is actually a rehashed version of the Job system from FFV.  Except in FFV it felt serious and mature-here it feels like you're playing Barbie dress-up.  Also, unlike FFV, you usually need to switch outfits in mid-battle, which slows battle down in an irritating fashion.  Another complaint that brings down the score in this section is the irritating phrases of your characters in battle.  Just listening to Rikku sqeal out another irritating inane phrase makes me cringe.  Gameplay (0/10): If the rest of my review isn't enough for you, here's the final nail in the coffin. I was excited when I heard this game would be non-linear.  I thought it would be like Chrono Cross, where there was a story that you moved through, but certain key decisions (i.e. choose to rescue a character vs. not doing so) made along the way would affect future plot points.  Not so here, it is a mission based system with almost no direction.  The only real effect skipping half the inane crap does is to keep you from getting the perfect ending.  Things as small and pointless as forgetting to talk to one random NPC in chapter 2 could make you miss 1/2 a point which would prevent you from getting that perfect ending.  The effect of this is that you must follow a guide to the nearest letter, thus ruining any feeling of "non-linearity".  Oh, and all those "fun" sidequests you'll be doing aren't fun at all.  Overall score (1/10)- *NOTE that this is not an average, it's my subjective feel of what this game deserves.  As for whether you should rent or buy this, I suggest neither.  In fact, if you're a fan of the original FF10, I suggest you forget this game ever happened.	-1
I don't think Square has ever been involved in something as bad as this game.  I picked it up after playing (and enjoying FFX) hoping to find a continuation of the innovative storyline, development and overall fun.  What I got was about as enjoyable as a knee to the groin.  At times I was tempted to break the game in half simply to assure that I would never accidentally put it in and play this beast again.  Anger and spite aside, on with the review.  This game continues the FFX story just about where you ended.  It is 2  years later and the land of Spira has turned into one giant theme park where everyone and their mother is a tourist.  Two factions, governed by what looks like 13 year olds, have taken control of the population and are about to come to blows.  The game starts out at a concert where Yuna is performing a song and dance number, which is where I begin to taste a bit of bile.  It seems that Yuna has given up on her priestly ways completely, lost about 10 years of maturity, and started a life as a scavenger/pop star.  Throughout the game you are forced to deal with her singing and dancing and a poor attempt to build a plot around it.  Other co-stars from the first installment are back as well.  Lulu, Wakka and Kimhari make their cameo appearances but contribute nothing to the story.  Rikku comes back as a playable character, but she seems to have de-evolved into a prepubescent child as well.  I won't go into the storyline at all, simply because it would hard to say anything about it without giving the entire premise away completely.  Let me just say it is shallow, very shallow, and completely not worth investing the time to see the endings.  Just look them up on Youtube and that would be good enough.  Game mechanics were severely underdone in my opinion.  After the success of FFX, square could have simply ported the game over, changed the names around, and made yet another success out of it.  This game consists of all of the bad parts ported over, and new dumbed down material.  The awkward conversation scripts, irritating voices, and giant plot holes are all back again.  Sadly, all of the good things are gone.  Gone is the sphere grid leveling system, the multiple character with some nice storyline, even a good underlying story is too much to ask of this game.  The combat system is nice, I have to give it that.  You are given three characters for the entire game, but you have the ability to change their profession in mid-combat.  Sadly, because every battle is fast paced and all of your skills, magic and even items require a large amount of time to use, you will fight most of your battles by holding the button down and attacking madly until something dies.  All of the visuals, monsters, characters and settings are a straight port from the previous release which I found odd since this game is far shorter.  I got through it with about 60% completion in under 20 hours.  While spending more time to get 100% will get you another 1.5 minutes of ending sequence, it is really not worth your time.  In all, looks as good as the original.  While I liked the fast paced, quick thinking fight system, the omission of an interesting leveling system was irritating.  This game was a slap to the face of the fan base it was supposed to be made for.  At many points, the shear shallowness of the dialog, lack of character development and simpleminded mini-games make you feel like you are playing a game more suited for 11 year olds.  Then you get a thong shot of Rikku or you hit the point you have to give  a sensual massage to a woman for points and you wonder what the heck the creators were thinking.  If you are a fan of Final Fantasy gaming, avoid this one.  If you are not a fan, well, you have no reason to touch this one anyway.	-1
I think most RPG gamers expected something decent out of this game. Beinga hardcore gamer myself, and someone who loved its prequel FF 10, I was jumping to buy 10-2.   First off, let me say that this is the only Final Fantasy game I EVER RETURNED! Thats right, i keep all my games, even the average ones. This one however I had to return due to its "piece of junk-ness".   FF 10-2 revolves around a trio of girls, 2 of which were characters in the previous FF 10 game. They go off on their adventures doing this, doing that, and in general, you don't really know quite what they are doing. Unlike regular Rpg's where you have a story, and a plot, this game sorta starts with you in your little flying ship able to go everywhere. Its like gigantic minigame. The places you go to don't really have any story, you just land at place A, fight monsters, get some item, and your done. Saying this, there are some awesome mini-games in FF 10-2, which was surprising since most recent Final Fantasy games have failed with minigames.   Now, onto the irritating part. You get to play 3 girls as characters. 3 annoying, teenie-bop girls. Girls who are what, late teens? Except they act like they are 9. They run about saying "oh poo" and other similiar phrases. Plus they take baths in skimpy underwear, and massage other girls, and walk about in thongs and skin tight outfits. MMM as a 40 year old gamer, I immensely enjoyed it (NOT!). The game looks like it programmed by experienced Japanese gamers, but created by their 9 year old daughters, and designed by their 11 year old horny sons. To gain abilities and powers you have to change into outfits. Thats right, you change your girl's clothes to gain abilities. And each outfit is tighter and more revealing than the last.    The game looks beautiful, definitely as great or better graphics as FF 10. But thats all the game excel's at, graphics. No plot, no story, very very bad dialogue and character development (unless you count bra's and thongs as development). There are some very good minigames, and of course the grapics look stunning (did i say that already?). But if you aren't a 11 year old kid, you will hate this game. I couldn't even push my way through the dumb parts, I got disgusted with the game half way through and had to return it for something decent.	-1
Wow, i thought that final fantasy series would be the best series ever, well i was wrong, i've played ff from 1 to 10, except for the 3 that never reached the states, well, this games simply sucks, it looks great, great sound, the interesting clothes changing in the middle of the battle, the excelent battle system, wow at first you look at the game as the thing that you've been expecting for so long, but then you see the reality, chapters, one chance to do some things, and the incredibly torturing percentage system. To speak more clearly, there are some things that you can do only once, if you fail on doing it, you have to reset and retry it, there are people that you can speak with to advance in the percentage and there are people that you should avoid to advance in the percentage, if you speak to somebody you shouldn't in the chapter you'll miss the percentage needed to see what you came looking in this game, then if you miss something you cannot do it again if you're in a different chapter.  It's confusing the fact that you cannot do everything when you see the people or get the mission, because you've to do some thing in the 3 chapter to get +3% but you can do the same thing in chapter 1 but you'll get 1%.  To really "enjoy" the game, you need a gameguide, TO BE READING ALL THE GAME ALONG (the official one won't serve you by the way), you need something done to get all the percentage, the game has five endings but only one ending that you wan't to see, the 100% ending because the others just suck.  In conclusion, the traditional talking to people and nice walking around the world is jeopardized by the fact that you're going to screw it talking to somebody you shouldn't until chapter 4 or 3, causing it to give you less percentage or not giving you percentage at all. Those people you saw with bad eyes because they constantly use game guides to beat the games, well you'll become one of them with this game.  True FF fans avoid it at all costs, this game sucks big time, just stick to the story of the X and you will remain happy with Yuna and his friends.  People of Square, Hironobu Sakaguchi... what where you thinking when you created the percentage system? i can see now why namco is gaining ground on the rpg games.	-1
If you're expecting anything anywhere near as good as any other Final Fantasy game, you're in for a huge disappointment.  If you're a shallow 13-year-old boy eager for fan service, welcome home.  The bad:  Characters. Imagine an annoying stereotype of a dumb, shallow woman who spends most of her time jumping up and down giggling and talking about make up.  That is how the three main characters are portrayed.  If you like Yuna or Rikku in FFX, you're likely to be very irritated by what Square turned them into.  This cheesiness permeates every aspect of the game.  In order to change job class, you change their "dresses," and the characters strip and put on a new dress every time you change their job class.  A mini-game even entails one girl giving another a massage and you have to press the right buttons to massage her well.  And let's not forget the scene where they all splash about in the water in their underwear, giggling.  Story.  There isn't really one.  It's mostly the three characters going around the world map fighting unimpressive enemies and giggling.  As an example, FFX opened with a character's city getting destroyed by a gargantuan powerful force.  FFX-2 opens with a pop concert, and the theft of Yuna's outfit.  The good:  Battle System.  Now this is great, which is why this game got three stars instead of one.  You can actually change job classes in the middle of a battle, and characters improve their stats within each job class instead of overall.  The jobs have some of the classics, as well as some interesting new ones.  The battles themselves are varied and complex, as are the various interesting abilities the characters can acquire.  Graphics.  Awe-inspiring.  If you can grit your teeth through the cheesy dialogue, irritating characters and complete lack of story then you will see a very visually beautiful game and absolutely breath-taking FMV's.	-1
I love all of the previous Final Fantasy games.  They all have a good storyline along with excellent gameplay.  Final Fantasy X-2 ends that streak though.  The idea of continuing with a story from an earlier game is good, but they definitely picked the wrong one to go with.  Wouldn't it have been much cooler to see Cloud and the aftermath of FF VII?  The story is just terribly uninteresting in this game.  What I absolutely hated was the amount of "humor" that they tried to put in.  I felt like this game was geared more toward 14-year-old girls than to the gamers who have been playing FF all along.  Rikku and Brother are the two most annoying characters ever to be in a game.  I couldn't stand listening or seeing either one of them.  This was the first FF game that I didn't play through a second time.  I didn't get the good ending where Tidus comes back, but then again, I didn't care.  I hate to say it, but I just wanted it to get over with. Please, do not buy this game.	-1
Let me begin by saying that this game is very different from FFX.  Do not expect an epic story here.  And the battle system is drastically different.  All three of the main characters are females.  The story takes place in Spira.  Yuna, Rikky, and a new character, Paine are Sphere Hunters.  They travel all over the continenct searching for these artifacts.  The story is very lightweight and definitely not engaging.  However, the game is not a bad RPG.  If you simply just want to pass the time and play an RPG, then this game will do.  Just do not expect it to be anywhere near as good as FFX. In my view, there are many other superior RPGs out there that should be first on your list.	-1
I was skeptical of this game from the start, but I bought it anyway because games with female lead character's amuse me. Let's see what was good about this game.........................................................................................................................................NOTHING!!!! A game where all you do is run around and play dress up. WOW!!! That will appeal to masses ( If your a 12 year old girl ). Any rpg fanatic like me has nothing but respect for Squaresoft and the Final Fantasy series, but my respect level has gone down a few points. I'm sure Squaresoft will be more careful in the future after the horrible reviews this game has received ( I was surprised to see there were actually some high reviews on this game here at amazon ). But no one who knows what good rpg's are all about will give this game a good review. Talking about this game makes me lose my temper so I'm going to quit now.	-1
This game was so disappointing. I mean Yuna was a smart, all together character in FFX, and in this game they make her into a ditsy, gun toating, diva. Not to mention the fact that there are no weapons to equip, and i won't even get started on the silly dresspheres.  Like other reviews have stated, i agree i have no idea who this game was supposed to appeal to and it makes me worry about the upcoming Final Fantasy games.	-1
this isn't a proper final fantasy this is final fantasy with crappy dance sequences. ok this game starts of with a dance sequence with someone {if youve played ffx} who was up tight and a selfless hero in this she's one of the spice girls literally its like three spice girls pain=scary spice {buch and acts like a man only shes white}rikku=baby{bloody irratating the worst game character ever}and yuna=ginger{she doesnt no her place) and the new yuna in this game detracts as much as sofia coppola does in godfather part three the fighting style gets put down by dress spheres look i love final fantasy every single one except this this game belongs in hell with hitler	-1
Disappointing game. Saw this in a video store once and ever since then was searching for it. Amazon just happened to have a copy so I purchased it. Played it and the characters are quite amateurish - when they talk mouths do not move, movement is quite cumbersome, etc. You drive an 18-wheeler semi through the contryside in an attempt to gain favor with your mother who owns the trucking business. You can crash into buildings, cars, cop cars, motorcycle gangs. You do battle with these elements as well. Vehicle upgrades are available but the money that it takes to upgrade is incredible - the money you make on a delivery is soon gone just to buy gas. You can borrow money from a loan shark but the interest they want is also incredible so anything/everything you earn is quickly gone. Anyway, Amazon was the only place that had this game and I gave it a try. Disappointing game.	-1
I wore Skyrim and Oblivion out -- multiple characters, high levels -- I'd been everywhere and done everything five times over. So I tried Morrowind. But it's too old-fashioned. The scenery is basic flat planes, I couldn't find the fast travel (and if there isn't fast travel, I don't want to play). The characters are ugly. Given all that, I wanted to keep trying, but your control over your character during battles is so unresponsive and soft, that I couldn't stand it. I'll just have to wait for Elder Scrolls VI.	-1
This games just not what I was expecting it to be, it's not my kind of game at all. Can't Recommend it.	-1
I grew up playing RPGs starting with Dragon Warrior for Nintendo and most recently playing the much more action oriented WoW.  This game just doesn't appeal to me.  If I wanted to play a game that took as much work as this I'd just go get a second job.	-1
Morrowind is an incredible game, but it really loses its flair on the XBOX.  Don't get me wrong, this game will probably be the best RPG you ever will pick up in a long time. But when you play this game on the XBOX, you are treated to horrid load times.  The game takes over 3 minutes to just load initially.  You have to load every area you go into, and if you die, you have to load the game 3 more minutes.  You spend more time looking at the load screen than you will actually playing.  After getting frustrated with the load times, and sometimes having it freeze on the XBOX, I gave up and bought a PC version of MW.  I kept hearing that this game would take forever to load on the PC, but it took less than 6 seconds overall.  My computer isn't beefy either.  The graphics engine is much improved from the XBOX, and since you're using a mouse (which is what the game is inteded to use with), the interfaces are a breeze to go through.  In terms of the gameplay, you won't find another text-heavy, total immersion game such as this.  Rather than leave a long winded review on what I thought of the mechanics, I encourage you to read others reviews.  They pretty much sum up exactly how I felt while playing this game.  THis is a must have if you enjoy RPGs; it's that good.  Just don't buy it for the XBOX.  You will get a reduced graphics engine, and incredibly long load times.	-1
With far too many bugs and crashes and the slowest load times of any save games ever seen on the XBOX this game is basicly unplayable by all but the most patient or fanatical.	-1
Morrowind for the Xbox is a role-playing game (RPG)where you can play it from a first person perspective or third-person. I truly hate this game, but first let me tell you the good points. The graphics are really good, complimented with excellent music. The worlds you travel on are HUGE and expansive, there are so many places to explore. There are tons of items you can aquire, or purchase, I mean tons! Morrowind also does a good job of showing a rich detailed history with lots of non-player characters (NPCs) you will interact with. But the fun ends right there because everything else about this game is garbage! It will clock your Xbox system to the max, you'll hear constant access to the hard drive and cd-drive, the game's performance is horrible; with lots of slow-down and severe drop in framerate. Loading a level takes FOREVER, it has the longest loading time of any Xbox game out there! There is little character speech, so you should expect to do a lot of reading inside the game- lots and lots! PSONE games have way more speech than this! There are tons of useless items you can collect! Just grabbing items is a chore because you have to aim your crosshairs with pin-point accuracy (its a pain just to grab plants or flowers) The animation is like an old Nintendo game! The game controls are sluggish like the framerate! The sound effects are cheap and sparse! The NPCs stand around like fools doing nothing! The NPCs are always rude and annoying "What do you want?" "Stop bothering me". They will act nice to you only if you give them money (they're all a bunch of gold diggers!). Your character will get stuck to objects! There are clipping problems as well with the graphics! The combat is boring and stupid as heck! You hit once, they you once and on it goes! The weapons lack power and impact. I stand by my reviews and I don't care what other Morrowind fans say about it.	-1
How can this game get game of the year? I have been very disapointed with two RPG games I recently have bought Morrowind and Ultima IX. Ultima IX a game the critics pounced on and gave horrible reviews I feel was actually a better game. At least Ultima IX has a more interesting story and better quest system. I loved this game the first couple hours I played it, but after the first week my interest in the game started to diminish. In the begining I assumed it would get better later on, I assumed there would be new monsters I would face, I assumed after I explored my first dungeon that they all would look unique and be different, I was wrong. Many of the monsters seem to inherit the same look as other monsters the only thing that differentiates them is the name at the top. For instance a slave, a vampire, an npc, and your own character all can look exactly the same if say they are all dark elfs. I was very dissapointed with the vampires in this game. I was expecting to see a monster with pale skin, wearing a black cape, has fangs, and floats across the floor. Instead vampires look just like any other NPC or character of that race.  I was also disapointed with the bosses in this game. In Diablo II and Baldurs Gate bosses had a unique look and actually looked fearsome, not so  All the dugneons and caves in this game look like they were just cut & pasted. In Baldurs gate and Diablo II each dungeon looked different and had a unique theme with mosnters unique to that dungeon, not so in morrowind. After you have been in one dungeon you have been in all of them. I also was expecting the dungeons to have a more creepier look and really did not care for the U.S. Steel look. Oh and the missions, well they were really fun at first, but after a while you relize they are the same fed-ex type missions. Go kill so and so and report back to me, go steal/buy something and report back to me, please escort John Doe somewhere and report back to me. I was expecting a more origional quest system implemented than simply the Everquest Fed-Ex system.  After a while all this runing back and forth gets very annoying, tiring, and old.	-1
The game has great potential.  The Psi powers are a great touch but for TK they are pretty useless.  Well I take that back, mind drain has its uses.  But the game itself... ugh... the story is pathetic, without a minimum of charm and basically one huge cliche.  The game itself is flawed in many ways, a major one is that enemies pop out of nowhere.  Now if this was a non-stop action game that would be OK, but your guy is kinda fragile and it takes a lot of shots to kill even the smallest bad guy.  Now you clear a room assuming no one can come from a direction and sure enough, as soon as you turn around they spawn at predermined places.  This can really ruin your run at the game if they happen to do this right next to you (they will also do spawn just outside your field of vision, to ensure surprise I guess).  Combine that with a horrible jumping interface, very low ammunition limits, very few guns, useless hand to hand combat (anyone actually uses that in this game?), and the ability to save only at checkpoints and you have a very frustrating game on your hands.  TKing enemies is fun, but not that fun.	-1
This kit includes a headphone accessory, but the Game Boy Advance does not have an ear phone jack, which is misleading. Seems like they're trying to justify the high price of this unit with additional items.  This kit is worth about $20, but definitely not $40.	-1
First, I should say I am not a GAMER I am just someone that likes tec toys and wanted a Playstation to get into what it is all about. I try to pick games that I think will be higher on graphics and entertaining story  and lower on skill levels. For me this was not the game to get. It just was too hard for me to keep up with, as far as pushing the right buttons at the right time. I did enjoy the club house BUT unless you WIN more then you Lose there is not much to do there so, needless to say, I traded this game in a long time ago.	-1
Really, do they really expect us to pay $50 for a game thats not worth $10?!? Its one on one for god sakes! WHo wants to pay the maximum amount of money for a game for a basketball game, when you cant even play real basketball. And who in the name of anyone came up with the idea to ball for cars and items!??! thats totally lame! Sure, it would be cool if it was real basketball with the extra one on one FEATURE. But when its just one on one without the real basketball feature, ouch, this isn't going to do very well:(	-1
NBA Baller for the XBOX is such a poorly executed game. It has excellent graphics, fluid animation, good music and lots of player customization. You can create name your character, the way he looks and what clothes he wears. Then you can set his attribute skills, like how well he dribbles the ball, shoots, slam dunks, speed and so forth. The main problem with NBA Baller is that the game cheats! You dribble the ball away from the cpu player, go near the basket, shoot the ball and score points. Then you have to play defense and try to prevent the cpu player from scoring, but you will see the A.I. always catch-up and surpass your score. It is so fake! Another problem with this game is that it is played 1 one 1 basketball, there are no teams, very few rules and no strategy in the game. This results in a boring experience. There are so many better basketball games out there that you shouldn't bother with this junk. Pros: +excellent graphics +excellent controls +good music +character customization +set character attributes Cons: -CPU catches up -CPU cheats -super long load times -half court gameplay -no teams or team mates -one on one gameplay -gets old really fast -needs more game modes -no adjustable camera	-1
This game is fun for about a day or two, or for a party with friends.  It is infuriating if you actually keep at it and try to get better and use strategy.  Because of the emphasis on offense (as in NBA Street), there is precious little strategy needed to win.  Defense is a lost art and a source of utter frustration; for example you may block a shot, yet it still goes in, yet when the CPU blocks, the ball falls towards them half the time.  The moves are cool, the unlockables are neat, yet ultimately it is a shallow game.  The whole emphasis on consumer goods (buy a nice house, car, posse, etc) is a nice idea that is poorly implemented.  Ultimately, the games are all as follows: 1)dribble towards your opponent 2)Perform the "Act a Fool" moves 3)dribble by opponent 4)Shoot 5)Get back on "defense" and watch your opponent score on you, no matter what you do.  Also, the utter lack of reliability in terms of the shooting is aggravating; there is no rhyme or reason to your jumpshots.  You may hit them with someone in your face, yet you may miss 4 in a row while wide open.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game, it's just that those looking for a little depth may want to look elsewhere (like ESPN NBA 2K4, which has a street mode not unlike this game).  The graphics are okay (both ESPN NBA 2K4 and NBA Live 2004 are better) and the sounds is good, but the loading times are TERRIBLE.  Seems like half the game is spent waiting to load.  Rent first!	-1
I guess not too bad if you can pick up a cheap copy but could have been done a lot better. The camera angles get irritating, it's hard to judge distance and you spend a great deal of time falling, the combat system is weak. Pretty much you spend the entire time just running around collecting courage pts and coins when you aren't dying. It's not a game you can play along time without getting a headache......UPDATE! This game friggen sucks! Your hobbit is helpless, you have maybe 2 attacks and with the lack of depth and screwball camera angles it's impossible to fight. Despite the fact you have no dodges and every enemy in the game moves twice as fast as you. It's been along time since I've smashed a game but Better the game than my console!	-1
What a joke! This is just as bad as The Fellowship of the Ring game. I really don't see how this game is rated above 1 star. If you want to play a real LOTR game, get EA's Two Towers and Return of the King. Vivendi just doesn't know when to stop. Another useless game that will find its way into the discount bins. Hey it's your money, I just like buying games that are worth the money I spent. Fair warning: rent the fellowship of the ring and the hobbit first before buying!!!	-1
I really don't know how hard it is to make a battling engine fun. The creators installed bad camera angles. They also made the fighting bland. These 2 things combine to make the game a less-than-average expierience. The camera can affect you during platform jumps. If you want a platform game get "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time". If you want a fighting game get Tekken 2. If you want a great game simply avoid "The Hobbit".	-1
YOU NEED TO BE A MAGICIAN OR A COMPUTER GEEK JUST TO DOWNLOAD THIS GAME INTO YOUR COMPUTER. I BOUGHT THIS GAME  TWO MONTHS AGO AND HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST IDEA ON HOW TO GET IT TO RUN AND I HAVE A TOP OF THE LINE COMPUTER WITH LOTS OF POWER.	-1
The first warning I got that perhaps Rhem was not going to set any records for standards was on installation. "You will need QuickTime 4!" it informed me. "Here is the website to get it!" A quick search confirmed it: they require QuickTime (an older version at that) but don't supply it. You have to go to the Apple website and download it yourself. Is that impossibly hard, does it mean the game is useless and mean? No, but it's a flashing red light all the same: the game is not going to be helpful. You want a shortcut, something on the Start menu, access to the game in any fashion? Go get it yourself. Rhem feels and plays like a 1992 attempt to be Myst, with the bad graphics, cheap memory-stingy movement, and dull storyline that we've come to associate with the era. The scenery is machines, machines, machines. I lost patience with it in record time and hope I never get bored enough to go back to it. If you played the original Myst and haven't used your computer for anything but spreadsheets since then, you might find Rhem mildly diverting. Otherwise don't bother.	-1
The single player missions are just god aweful and super unfair and the multiplay needs massive improvement.	-1
I dun know, maybe this game is good, i just don't like b-ball games idn but this game is easy. Its not challenging, its just like... you know how basketball games are. Maybe it is good... the part about the bling...i dun know decide for yourself. To me its bad cuz its easy. A real good game is Def Jam Fight For NY now thats a real good game.	-1
Despite the rave reviews by UbiSoft employees posing as customers, Athena Sword, like Raven Shield, is substandard and buggy. UbiSoft has a tendency to buy companies with hit titles, and then have their own development teams produce lower quality sequels, hoping to make sales on the strength of the original games' reputations. Ever since UbiSoft bought Red Storm Entertainment and started producing the Rainbow Six games themselves the gameplay has changed for the worse, the story lines have become increasingly contrived and obviously written with more concern for political correctness than realism, and the bugs have been out of control. There have been over a dozen patches released for Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield since it's release, and Athena Sword has even more bugs. I have never owned a game which required so many patches. The online play is nowhere near as good as Rogue Spear (although better than Counter Strike, if you prefer realistic tactical shooters to the run-and-gun arcade style games) and the single player campaigns aren't challenging enough to provide more than a few hours of entertainment. If you've already bought Raven Shield and are considering buying Athena Sword, my suggestion would be to wait until the price drops, which is closer to it's actual worth. In the meanwhile, there are plenty of better designed user-made levels for single player and multiplayer play available for free download all over the internet if you're looking for more content for Raven Shield. Here are a couple of the problems and bugs found so far: While prone with the M240G Heavy Machine Gun, there is no animation of the belt being fed through the receiver While using an Athena Sword weapon the hand and arm models in first person view have holes in the geometry The SM4 CQB Machine Gun points around a 15 angle up All of the Athena Sword weapons have the same firing sound with small tweeking, and not the awesome new sounds Ubi promised The G3A3 and the G3KA4 appear to be identical to the player except for color There are areas where textures which are supposed to be Flagged as false backdrop are not, and the skybox does not show through like it is supposed to	-1
I was only able to get past the opening scene and then the game kept crashing.  Unfortunately I didn't realize that there are only two types of graphic cards work this game.  The system requirements were for the following graphic cards: 32 MB NVIDIA GeForce 1, 2, 3, 4, or FX; ATI Radeon 7000-9800 OR BETTER. Since my laptop is brand new I assumed my graphics card (Intel chipset) was considered the "or better'!  Oh well, I was really looking forward to playing Uru since I've played all the other Myst games.  I don't understand why UBI did this.  The other games were just fine.	-1
Running with AMD Athlon XP 2500+, Radeon 9600, and a gig of RAM, so no technical or performance problems. The game itself is the problem. The user interface is terrible. Character movement is clumsy and imprecise. The game itself seems pointless, an aglomeration of nothing in particular for no discernible reason. As many have remarked, probably the base URU was originally intended as a small set of training levels for online play, which at the present does not look like it is ever going to happen. Running around the desert at the beginning for no reason at all with nothing much to do or see was the most fun I had with the game; and that was not much fun. It was all downhill from there. There is no coherence to the game experience that I could discern. The puzzles are just stuck in, they do not feel like part of the story. Indeed the "story," is really just a shell of a building without an interior; again the story itself was something that would be expected to develop in the online play. Overall, I found the atmosphere, the music, the ambience, and the art to be rather depressing. I would like to say that there are some good moments that make up for it all, but if there are I never encountered them. Reviews tend to be either love it or hate it when it comes to URU. I would highly recommend trying the demo first before buying the game.	-1
this game is boring and dumb. all you do is walk around this stupid porely designed kingdom I don't recomend it. Age of Mythology is a better myth game	-1
The little action figure that you create is irritaing to move.  I never did get the hang of it and spent lots of time spinning around and bumping into things.  The game itself seems to have a marketing strategy geared toward the online game.  I found the problems difficult, actually impossible, to solve.  Much frustration here.  Lots of side tracks that have nothing to do with solveing the game puzzles which lead to hours of boredom and frustration.  Much better to play previous games of Riven and Exile.  Even the original Myst has a charm and satisfaction that this game lacks.	-1
For all those reviewers who couldn't make this game work with their video cards, don't feel bad about it; just get your refund and thank your lucky stars that you didn't try to play the wretched thing. I'd really like to have a word with the idiot who designed the user interface. There are several ad-hoc standards for interaction and motion, and URU uses none of them. The involuntary switch between first and third-person viewpoints is clunky and confusing. (Try Schizm II for a good example of how to do it, lads). There is no conventional save and restore mechanism: the game 'remembers' your latest position and restores you to the start of that level when you restart the game. Infuriating. Although several of the puzzles involve moving objects, the only way the system allows you to do this is by nudging them with your feet. What was the designer thinking about! Now that I've got further into the game, my initial impression of the graphics has improved: although much of the interiors are that muddy grey/brown typified by games like Morrowind, there are a few nicely-rendered scenes. Backgound music is sparse, and the samples are too short - after the third or fourth iteration, even a pleasant tune becomes irritating. Quite frankly, the game looks like an attempt to capitalize on the Myst branding by a bunch of money-grubbing hacks who wouldn't recognize a playable adventure game if one jumped out from behind a bush and bit their leg off. Biggest disappointment of the 2003 gaming season, I'd say....	-1
I am sorry. The disc is very scratched. It was too overpriced for the condition. I can get other discs in same condition for half the price or less. If it had been much cheaper I would have kept it. I am returning it.	-1
Didnt come with the start up disk. Not recommended.	-1
Can't use no disk	-1
Game is a total joke and a waste of money. Storyline just jumps from one topic to another, its hard to keep up with whats going on. The save system really ruins the game with is making you start at the beginning of level or two levels in a cheap attempt to make the game seem longer. AI is worthless and almost comical at times as they get stuck in between walls and fail to sound alarms when they spot you.	-1
My computer freezes when I try and play this game which is completely and totally amazing to me.  I just got done playing Doom 3 which is far more of a resource hog.  So, I can only guess how good this game is.  I even went online and got the update.  So, my advice is don't waste your money.  It is a dog.  Update:  OK, I did some research, which I should have done first... there is pretty much no way to play this if you have a CD burner... the game thinks that if you have the software to burn cd's you'll try and make illegal copies of the disk!  Instead of burning copies, I think I'll just burn the original.  Or perhaps drive over it with my car.  And then burn it.  Or perhaps.... stupid Ubisoft!	-1
Here's the basic run-down:  What you have here is a first-person shooter, made with the Unreal engine.  It was based on a Belgian comic book, and imitating the style of said book, it uses a nifty graphic effect called "cel-shading" which makes the polygonal characters look less like the realistic figures many games aim for and more like cartoon or comic-book characters.  Game play is divided between straightforward action sequences and goal-based sequences, usually involving stealth.  So far so good. But...  As a gamer, I always take things with a grain of salt when a reviewer says a game is too hard.  For many gamers, the response that comes to mind is invariably "Maybe it was too hard for YOU..."  But listen.  I can play through most games on their "regular" difficulty setting, and this one I gave up on, largely because of the aforementioned "stealth" sections.  There are stealth games, and games with stealth segments, that I enjoyed.  Metal Gear Solid and Deus Ex both come to mind. But a stealth game really ought to have some, if not all, of the following features: 1) Being spotted by an enemy makes things difficult, but does not automatically kill the player.  2) Stealth gameplay should allow players a great deal of flexibility in routes to take and tactics to use; it should never be "read the designers' minds or die."  3) Stealth games should have a system for saving your game that doesn't mean you have to sneak past the same four guards over and over again because you keep getting spotted by the fifth.  Guess what game fails on all three counts?  *ding* *ding* *ding*!  That's right, unlucky number XIII.  Many of the stealth sections are _exactly_ matters of memorizing the guards positions (after innumerable failures), then timing your movements with theirs, or failing.  Want to kill one of those obnoxious, alarm- raising guards?  Oops!  Pity the patrol path of another guard (who you never saw) takes him within line of sight of the body.  You can move bodies, IF you're using a weapon that leaves one or both hands free, a fact the manual fails to mention.  The main character also has a kind of "sixth sense" which allows him to see visible, comic-like "tap tap taps" on screen when an unseen enemy is walking nearby, but it's only intermitently useful.  Expect to still be blindsided with annoying frequency.  Compounding all this frustration is a save-game system that is dead lousy, even for a console port.  Expect to be able to save at the beginning of a level, and that's it.  If you're lucky, the designers may have deigned to give a checkpoint or two, frequently at points that make little sense (not immediately before a "boss battle", but three bad guys before it?)  The combination of these two points is unforgivable.  I gave up on this game on a stealth-based submarine level featuring guards walking overhead on catwalks.  These catwalks made guards who could see me nearly impossible to spot myself and literally impossible to kill before they triggered an alarm.  Thanks, guys, I love games that make my small advances in progress meaningless in such an arbitrary fashion.  Irritating but less game-killing annoyances:  The game's characters lip-sync their speech in a fashion barely better than the old Speed Racer cartoons.  For a game with such fluid animation otherwise, and given any number of recent games with very good in-engine character lipsync, this is incomprehensible.  Lead actor David Duchovny's inflection seems utterly uninterested in the intrigues around him (phoned in another paycheck, eh, Dave?)  And for a game that clearly prides itself on its storyline, there are weaknesses in pacing and moments that completely jar one's suspension of disbelief.  A "rescue mission" level ends if a guard trips an alarm while you're outside the prison, but this condition vanishes when you enter the prison itself.  (There's no alarms IN the prison?)  Some levels link one into another in a frustratingly endless fashion; other times, after a single level it's time for a cutscene, restored health, and a new weapons loadout.  The latter is both bewildering and annoying: Why does the protaganist, knowing he's heading into the lion's den, choose to leave some of his most powerful weapons behind?... Because he knows what kind of ammo the bad guys are going to be dropping when he kills them, I guess... The five missiles and the launcher you had at the end of one level are arbitrarily taken away from you, and then you discover you really _should_ have been conserving crossbow bolts during an unnanounced six-level stretch.  A side effect of the process is never knowing whether you should be conserving ammunition or not.  Don't expect the ammunition you need to be conveniently there when you need it; you'll find a ridiculous overabundance of ammunition in some places (throwing knives in the first aid station?  Of course!  Why not?...)  and a fatal dearth of same when you really do need it, like the aforementioned sub stealth mission.  Two last quibbles:  Despite doing a "full install", my version demands each of the four CDs be inserted sequentially as you progress through the game.  I also get barraged with unskippable logo sequences for Ubisoft, Nvidia, and Alienware EVERY SINGLE TIME I play.  (Ironic given I've been playing on a Radeon-equipped E-machine.)  To be fair: the graphics are frequently beautiful, the plot probably makes a pretty good graphic novel (if not the best game), the use of a grappling hook is interesting (though not unique), the ability to pick up some ordinary objects to use as blunt weapons is a nice touch, and the musical score isn't half bad.  Still, there are many better games on which to spend your time, even in the bargain bin, including first-person shooters.  Why frustrate yourself with ones like this?	-1
Ubisoft incorporated the copy protection software knows as Tages into XIII. This is singlehandedly the worst copy protection known to man. It's so bad that if you have a CD-RW or DVD-RW drive in your computer, the installation of the game will most likely purposely defect itself towhere the game won't run. If you have CD or DVD burning software, or anything even related, or any virtual drives, the same will most likely happen; defective installation. The game's "Minimum Requirements" are a lie since they're so low, and you need brand-new, up-to-date drivers for all your hardware. Not only all that, but the game straight out doesn't like some CD/DVD-ROM drives and thus won't install properly, or even at all. Ubisoft support does nothing. After all this, you'd think they were protecting a really nice game. But, no. The game is riddled with bugs and crashes. Major bugs are commonplace, and the official forum is thriving with hundreds of user requests for bug/crash help. The game also spans 4 CDs (for no apparent reason - the game is very short) that seemingly randomly need to be changed (more copy protection). This leads to scratched discs you can't duplicate, thus you must buy the entire game again. The game is beautiful and mildly entertaining, albeit short, buggy, and contains terrible voice acting and a horrid saving scheme. That's if you can even get it to install! What a waste of money. Beware!	-1
This game gets off to a good start:  you wake up on a beach, everything looks animation-cel painted, and your feelings of disorientation are well done using some sort of camera-wobble/blur technique.  The idea here was also to add comic-book stylings:  certain game elements appear in break-away and pop-up panels seperate to the main action, and sound effects get their own animation (like the "Bam!" of a gun or the "Tok!" of footsteps). From here the problems are many.  The savegame system mimics consoles:  you must make it to the next checkpoint to save, and at least one level had *no* checkpoint throughout the entire first part.  The gameplay is inconsistent:  sometimes I can take down an opponent with one shotgun blast to the midsection, other times it takes a half-dozen head shots.  There are times when a sequence starts you off surrounded by bad guys, and you end up standing there facing them, both of you plugging away at each other--no chance to duck behind cover or take them out strategically.  Sometimes the comic-panel animations appear *under* my screen - I can see the edges of the animation poke up at the top.  Sometimes the game locks up my hefty system.  And every time I start the game, Disc 1 isn't good enough:  it asks me to "please insert a XIII disc" until I give it Disc 2, 3, or 4. I would pay [less] for this game just to try it multiplayer, but at [the price] I was very disappointed.  I'd much rather have bought Max Payne 2.	-1
DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this game for your PC.  It is marked down for a reason.  This game is causing all kinds of problems on many systems; go to UBISOFT.COM and read the PC forums.  You will find many people are in the same boat.  If you have a CDRW drive the game will not even install properly.  Even when I did get it to work (it was beautiful by the way) it froze my entire system and my computer is not even a year old.  I have a GEFORCE 4 card with updated drivers and it still crashed.  Save yourself the headache and get it for a gaming platform like XBOX; you spend a few extra bucks but it is worth it.  I couldn't return my copy so I sold it to some kid.  You have been warned!	-1
was not haapy about people selling these thing without the disc and saying works fine	-1
Yeah, I honestly didn't know I needed a special CD to play Gameboy games on this thing. That's partly my fault. I've heard that this emulator isn't all that great anyway compared to the Super Boy for SNES. I guess I could just resell it to some unsuspecting soul.	-1
The company I got this from sent a GameCube controller instead. I did own this product before tho, and it was a lot fun being able to play game boy games on a bigger screen. If you can find one with a disc to play it buy it	-1
Well, it's great in the fact that it puts the gameboy advance game images on the big screen, but there is really no other point to it.  I think the idea is a good one, however, normally if I playing my Gamecube, I'd play Gamecube games and vice versa.  There is no difference in game play for any game, and you've lost the capability to move around.  The graphics overall don't change, only the size.  It's more of a hassle to hook up the Gamecube then to just put it in your SP or DS.  This is DEFINATELY NOT A NECESSITY for a Gamecube.	-1
This game used to be cool, and one of the Best MMO's out there.  However, in the past few months, Sony Online Entertainment has completely scraped the original game coding and rewritten it from scratch.  There used to be 30+ professions to play, and players used to be able to mix them and be hybrids.  Now there are only 9 professions, and players are stuck in their jobs... You wanna be a Smuggler, great your a smuggler, only there is no smuggling existent in the game... and you can't play your favorite Stars Wars musical instrument anymore in the Cantina's... as a side job.  The Combat System in the game has been overhauled at least twice in the last few months, the original system completely scraped and re-coded from scratch.  All these changes to the game are forced upon the players by SOE, and the players have to download them from SOE's servers to make sure their installed version is up to date with SOE's version.  Some of the downloads take hours, some even days for Dial Up users.  I have to burn all the downloaded updates into a CD or DVD for a friend of mine, and mail them to her because she gets them quicker that way.. because her Dial Up takes 36+ hours to download the biggest updates, and she can only let the download run for a few hours a day.  The game, at the present time... November 21st, 2005... the Game sucks.  SOE keeps promising changes to make things better, but they're either not coming fast enough for the players... or they just never come out with the cxhange at all... Smuggler's have been waiting 2 years now for the "promised" ability to be able to Smuggle in the game... Players are cancelling their accounts left and right.  SOE, on the day of their latest, and largest recode of the game... two weeks ago, Fired their Community Correspondent (Tiggs, a very popular person with the players) who is their voice between us the Players.. and them... because they didn't like what she was telling them what we were saying about the changes.  The game is supposed to be set in the timeperiod between the first two, Original Movies... Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back...  Yet LucasArts is producing the Expansions for this game and they keep pushing in Episode II and III content... instead of content designed for the correct time line.  Not only that, the new Clone Wars Content... is far better then the current timeline content... which supposed to be 20 years more advanced.  Jedi's... You wanna play a Jedi... this should be called, Star Wars: KOTOR Online.  The Jedi Population is out of control and it was SOE's biggest mistake to allow players to become Jedi's...  They should have left that as a rarity in the game, only had a few NPC Jedi's like Luke Skywalker in the game, as novelties for offering special Quests...  But no... they wanted to let players be Jedi's as a selling point.  How many Jedi did you see charging across the Hoth Battle Field with Luke, to take down the Imperial Walkers?  In Star Wars: Galaxies... there will be several hundred of them out there on Hoth... if SOE and LucasArts ever gets around to adding Hoth.  They're too busy adding Episode II and III content like the planets Kashyyyk and Mustafar... speaking of which, if you're a Jedi then you can go to Mustafar and help save Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost; whose "lost his way" ... how lame is that?  Now, they can't remove the Jedi from the game like they should.. because they hyped up being Jedi so much that "everyone and their mother" has one, or has played one... and would cry, bitch and comlain if SOE removed them.  SOE is "claiming" all these changes are making the game feel more "Star Wars" like... however within the last two weeks they have destroyed the in-game player economy, destroyed the orininal 30 Player Professions and redesigned 9 new ones... removed the ability to play a Hybrid Profession.. and turned the game into a massive online FPS that seems like it is based off of the KOTOR Timeline, instead of the Timeline it is supposed to be based off of... and ruined the combat system.  Do not buy this game.  If you want to play a Star Wars game, go play one of the Console Games like Star Wars: KOTOR series... or the new BattleFront series.  At present, this is probably one of the worst Star Wars Games ever made now.  It is all thanks to mismanagement and bad design ideas at SOE and  LucasArts... who both seem to think they can use this game to completely rewrite all of Star Wars history.  Maybe, someday in the future they'll get smart and fix this game... but for now... George Lucas ought to be ashamed of this game, it is an embarrassement to the Star Wars Universe.	-1
I have played Star Wars: Galaxies for 782 days according to the /getvet command. I have purchased all of the expansions out to date. I was considering creating a second account. As of 11-17-05 my account is cancelled. The New Game, also known as the Starter Kit, is the third version of SWG and it is riddled with bugs and incomplete. It is a far inferior product to its previous versions as well. The NG was released after being kept secret for an unknown period of time and allowing players only a two week notice of it being published. Even less time was devoted to it being tested by sources outside of SOE. Trials of Obi Wan and the NG were released in such a manner as to call into question SOE's and LA's ethics. As represented by the employees who post to the forums SOE and LA are uncarring, glib, and/or vastly out of touch with the player community.  Most of these are not new complaints. However, with the release of the NG these problems have escalted to such a degree that the game is no longer playable. While some are content to merely switch games I am not. Simply changing the direction of the flow of money to SOE and LA will not get their attention. I am boycotting all products created by Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts. I encourage others to do the same.  I do not think my actions alone with effect SOE or LA one iota. In fact, I doubt anything will change their policies. The fan base for Star Wars and other properties is sufficiently numerous to mitigate any discontent portion. While some have predicted that the NG will cause the collapse of SWG I believe otherwise. It will lose many current players but those will be replaced by SOE's and LA's new target market. SOE and LA will later use the negative comments and future subscriptions numbers to prove that they were right all along and to dismiss anyone who opposes them as being knee jerk reactionaries who are against change just because they don't like change. Because most likely the next expansion will also bring a new version of SWG as SOE and LA attempt to copy whichever game is doing better then.	-1
Dear god in Heaven this game is trash but it is still in away fun if you are an avid starwars fan like my self this game is awsome to bad it costs 20 friggin bucks a month it cost to much that even a true fan is given considerable pain and there are no space craft space and the jedi are weaklings tou want a starwars game try dark forces or JK2 or Kinghts of the old republic	-1
I buy most every game that comes out. I have a 1900+ rating in AoC and hovered just below 2k in AoM when I played. I also play most of the other MMORPGS with the exception of DAOC, just not my speed. I have never, ever seen a game that has this many catastrophic flaws and bugs. The server has been down at one point or another nearly every single day since it opened, and that is nothing.... A multitude of people have had everything they owned deleted out of the blue, most people have had some significant items deleted at one time or another. It is very hard to move to any new area of town without someone mentioning out loud that they just signed in and 'such-and-such' is now gone. Creatures magically disappear when you fight them, usually just before they die so you get no credit for fighting them. They also teleport in clear view on top of you because the servers are apparently VIC28s. There were a plethora of exploits known in the beta that they chose to ignore and let the people paying to support the game (which is still much less reliable than eves beta was, or EEs beta for that matter, which actually was buggy) use to advance to endgame levels that now have been made unapproachable for months to most. They embraced the "exploit early, exploit often" principle, mostly because a number of them play the game online....and also post on the website trashing anyone who has a problem with anything they do (under their player names, which doesn't denote that they are monetarily connected the game to anyone who hasn't happened to get to know them ingame), and delete totally legitimate posts (I have never had one deleted, but many of the ones that get deleted are just being deleted to promote a fraudulent image of the state of the game, which is terrible). Worst of all, there are untold numbers of bugs that were known in the beta that made the game completely unplayable, but they chose to ignore so that they could release the game and force the fans of star wars to pay to support it for them (please keep in mind, I play most MMORPGS, this is so far out of the realm of the minute amount other games have done that it makes Shaq-Fu look like viable product). There was 30 days playing time promised on the box. Out of the 30 days, there was a grand total of 1 that I was able to play without having a fatal error on their end make it unplayable. Having their faulty code damage stats as if armor was on 2 or 3 times over when no armor was on (making some stats negative :P) and insuring anything that touched you would kill you in 1 hit until the next day (or longer sometimes) when they would finally shake it off your character. Crashing for no reason and killing your character in the process, world comes back up an hour (or day, or 2) later and your character has huge wounds that force you to sit around in a hospitol for up to an hour...WHEEEEE. Deleting all your equipment and your money so you run around with starter gear trying to get money is real fun then. Having havesters dissapear with a weeks worth of gathering in them. Having entire suits of top grade armor regularly disappear when they are bought. All these things and thousands more were known before release and are acceptable to them (call their reps online and ask about the 30 days the box promises, they openely say could care less about any promises made and they will make no attempt to make ammends for charging you to play while their servers are completely unavailable. They released it anyway to make star wars fans (figuring they are loyal and could thus be exploited) pay for what is supposed to be pre-release troubleshooting and quality control. It is a shame and I am frankly stunned that Sony would allow this travesty to be enacted under their name :( -true__ibnFrey (Please save yourselves the frustration, lost time and effort. Eve online runs fantastically and is so well taken care of that it may well be the next long-term MMORPG to make it truly huge, AC2 has finally begun to listen to the gaming community and has been quietly building up a hard-earned fan base, a couple my buds play, Blizzard always comes through and there are other MMORPGS on the horizon (I can't wait for City Of Heroes ^^).) **edit** for the fanboys trying to blame the systems of people who are playing this game and honestly trying to warn other people from getting robbed, here are my specs: hyperthreaded 2.8, 1G RAM, 160Gb hard drive with nothing but 3 games on it, GeForce fx 5200. This game does NOT work...on any system. Every person who has any experience with MMORPGs knows the truth that is the most poorly supported and designed game ever released, it is a total disgrace (eve and ac2 get back to you within small hours, often within 1, average time on tickets in SWG is about 3-4 days (long time to go without playing and still being expected to pay for it), and that is on tickets they don't accidentally delete, which has been right about half of them in my experience (which means queueing up another 3-4 days (I've had 2 that took 8 and 10 days, respectively) wait of not playing).	-1
The game it self is pretty neat too look at looks very 3-d and i really appreciated the original thought put into it.  But the game it self totally had no substance.  the story was boring the aiming is way too damn hard to be a simple game.  I loved the way it looked but other than looks the game supplies nothing.  I wouldnt of gave it any stars Had the graphics not looked so cool!  Side note to designers  Make a game where the bodies don't disipear after you kill sombody!!! that totally ruins a game!!!	-1
Just why video-game designers love amnesiac main characters, I have no idea.  Maybe they can never dream up more creative ways of generating suspense and mystery other than the ol' "Who am I?"  XIII's main character is so devoid of colour, so boringly voiced and humourless, that even if the game itself were fun, the very fact that you have to play as an utter nerd for a main character just cripples the experience.  But this game isn't fun, either.  Half of this game is an example of just how horribly wrong a stealth game can be when the elements aren't right.  As a shooter this game fares somewhat better, but not much more.  Enemies strafe even faster than you and reloading takes forever, and their shots are so accurate that taking cover doesn't really help.  This game is also extremely stingy about giving you ammo (an average enemy drops maybe two shotgun shells and 10-20 bullets).  Frustrating, but at least there's action.  The stealth part, on the other hand, is plain garbage for a couple of reasons:  - Who came up with the idea of helmets?  I can't remember another single stealth game where a headshot doesn't kill an enemy.  In fact, the very concept of stealth games is impossible without headshot kills -- unless you have alternate methods of distracting or killing the enemy (Metal Gear Solid's choke/neck-break and noise distractions, for example).  - I don't know where main character "Number XIII" learned how to shoot, because even un-helmeted enemies seldom die with a headshot.  I've tested this by activating an invincibility cheat code, walking straight up to an enemy, and blasting him in the face.  Nope, still alive and kicking.  - No radar.  The "sixth sense" in this game which is supposed to replace this basic function is useless, because it tells you where enemies are by means of the "tap, tap" of approaching footsteps.  Which means you won't be able to spot an enemy who's a foot to your right, just offscreen.  - When special events occur, they use a "window-in-window" technique which is interesting visually (a comic-book device), but unhelpful to the player.  You don't know where these events take place in relation to your current location.  And sometimes, you hear an important conversation that's somewhere in your vicinity, but the game doesn't tell you where it's coming from.  Give me No One Lives Forever anyday, if first-person stealth/action shooters are your thing.  Cate Archer can kick "Number XIII"'s butt any day, and say more interesting things along the way.  I bought XIII from the bargain bin and wish I'd gotten myself a nice dinner instead.  Worth maybe five dollars, no more, and even then, I'd sell it the minute I finish it.	-1
This is probably the worst squad-based military game I have ever played.  i bought it right after it came out and was immediately disappointed.  The graphics are decent, but the AI is atrocious.  Squadmates just stand up in the middle of a field and start pointing at the enemies.  They do not hide when patrols are near you, nor do they cover you when you are doing recon on enemy positions.  The worst thing that could ever happen in a video game of this type happened to me.  I was standing on top of the extraction point at the end of a mission with the people I had rescued.  There was only one way up to the top of this rock that I was on, and I was covering it with my weapon.  Before the helicopter could come and pick us up, an enemy terrorist appears out of NOWHERE from behind me and kills me.  I turned the game off and sold it immediately.  Have never played since, nor will I ever.  If you like squad based games, avoid this one like it is an infectious disease.  Pick up Star Wars Republic Commando instead.  That is how squad-based action is supposed to be done.  SOCOM Navy Seals = Trash heap	-1
i'm a big fan of military and FPS (well this one is 3rd person, anyway) games. this is the worst squad game i've ever played. your teammates do not react as a real human would: they stand and try to shoot ennemies in plain sight, a group of ennemies appear and your teammates do not even go to find a spot to hide, way too many bugs, your teammates shoot but they do not dudge ennemies bullets (what is that wall next to u for?!). an enemy throws a grenade and your teammate do not even jump out from the area or throw back the grenade to the enemy, etc. they might walk like commandos/spec ops, shoot precisely like commandos/spec ops, but they do not respond at all like commandos/spec ops: i approach an entrance and these guys do not even get to hide on both side before the entrance nor a guy is watching my back. i go inside a building, these guys do not even follow me in line. u call that teamwork? this game is only good in multiplayer. not even worth a star. not even worth to buy. go for Star Wars Republic commando. now that's what i call a squad that respond according to the situation with real military procedures.	-1
In shooter games like this I like to use the left stick to aim and the right stick to walk.  This game has no such setting making it unplayable for a lefty like myself!  BOO!	-1
I used Atom Man as an example because if you have no idea who this guy is you realize he added nothing to the comic book world.  The game XIII adds nothing to the video game world. The concept of comic book style with a video game is interesting though not a first.  I'm sure I'm not the only one that wonders to myself,"Hey I bought an XBox to play ultra realistic, high graphic powered games.  What's up with cell shades?"  Well my friend, I have the answer... David Duchovny!  They needed to pay this "high talent" actor so much money to make this game that they ran out of funds to produce a graphic masterpiece.  And let us also ponder, how much talking does good ole Dave actually do?  It makes you wonder how much they paid Eve or Mary J Blige or Missy Elliot or whoever plays the girl, who is no Jennifer Lopez when it comes to acting.  That's not a compliment to either.  Anyway, the concept of cell shading was different, but not great, and yes, I know that it fits with the comic book style.  The story was terrible and I found myself just wanting to get to the end just to bring it back to the video store.  I'm done with this one.  Rent it if you can.	-1
I got this game as I love the tycoon games like zoo tycoon, roller coaster tycoon, etc. also diner dash and that type. It loaded quickly but even after watching the tutorial I couldn't figure out how to play it. I got to the first place you added stuff to the restaurant wall, and was stuck. I seen no way to figure it out, so I ended up unloading it. The graphics were okay. They weren't cartoonlike they were more realistic and you could watch the restaurant from different angles and inside and outside. Supposedly you can build other restaurants but since I couldn't get past the first one, I guess I never will. Definitely would not recommend it for kids.	-1
When im bouta make a purchase at shop sometimes it freezes or the sound disrupts.	-1
Nothing new here from the other games.  It was very very short and left a rather empty ending.  This game didn't even bother to have all your characters request your help in a dungeon which I enjoyed in the other games.  You are pretty much stuck with Black rose in this game and I liked other characters much better. One good point about this game is once you have SAVED "The World" you do get to continue to play and get item completion with some side dungeon quests added in.  The problem is I kind of lost interest as I was no longer playing to complete a story but just for fun.  After 4 games of the same fighting, this doesn't add much interest to me.	-1
This is the exact same game as the other games. There's a few new items, but nothing to celebrate. Sure it's a conclusion, but you just spent 200 bucks on 4 games that are all 12 hours(maximum) long. Way to go!	-1
...not with a bang, but with a whimper. That's exactly how I felt after finishing this final chapter of .hack. A series that began full of promise has done little except disappoint me. You all know about the series, so I'll forego the plot summary. A lot of people have played apologist for this series, answering the valid complaint of, "Why are ALL the games the same?" with a variety of sophistries, but the fact is, this game has little invention in it. I was disappointed in part two because of the ridiculous length of the game (it took me about nine hours). Part three answered this problem, and also had some nice bonuses (such as searching for ghosts of the series characters and finding items for trading), and I was eagerly anticipating part four. So what's the problem here? Not length; this game may be the longest of the bunch (although, it still only clocked in at about 23 hours; I like a little more meat on my RPG's). The gameplay is the same, but hey, that's what we've come to expect. No, the problem here is story, in that this game has little. Most of the questions you might have asked, most of the theories you might have postulated concerning The World won't be answered here. The end of the game (which, though I thought about it, I will not spoil here) is quite unsatisfactory  (ho-hum is the best word I can use to describe it), and in the end, this whole series (which, if you purchased new, will run you around two hundred bucks) left me feeling like I was cheated out of one hundred and fifty dollars. Yeah, I confess; there is enough material here for one game, maybe one and a half, but Bandai has cheated us out of a lot of money, in my honest opinion. Still, I can look forward to Xenosaga 2.	-1
came with case and everything and was very clean but it didn't work	-1
In MAGIC PENGEL, you doodle draw your characters and the game magically tranforms your sketches into 3D monsters. This is very cool. But the fighting is reminiscent of POKEMON STADIUM. You issue commands and watch the result. Not very exciting. Character control outside of the fighting is slow and frustrating and the saccahrin color scheme is a bit much. The supporting cast is your typical, over-the-top collection of anime goofballs. This game didn't hold my interest for nearly as long as I would have hoped. I'm probably too old for the intended audience. Nice idea. Limited enjoyment (as in none), in my opinion,	-1
Sold a copy that didn't work; seller was obnoxious; wouldn't recommend.	-1
I go into games with an open mind- even if I'm far out of the intended age range for them. Starting Magic Pengel, it reminded me a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Graffiti-Kingdom/dp/B0009KFA5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Graffiti Kingdom</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amazing-Island/dp/B0002EJ87K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amazing Island</a>. These were both games that I laughed at myself for playing, because I felt far too old for them, but I still enjoyed and played to completion. Like those games, Magic Pengel allows you to draw and create whatever you desire to use throughout the storyline (with varying success, based on your patience with the in-game drawing mechanic). But unlike Graffiti Kingdom and Amazing Island, Magic Pengel simply couldn't keep my attention. The plot is much thinner and I feel that even the innovative drawing mechanic was lackluster in comparison to games intended for similar age ranges, and while those other games can still appeal to older gamers with the novelty of this gameplay mechanic, Magic Pengel just can't because it doesn't contain the same charm. If you're buying this for a younger gamer, they may still enjoy it, because the idea is still fun, but I'd highly recommend looking into other games that have employed this mechanic better, like the aforementioned two.	-1
Drawbacks -the graphics and gameplay are idenical to the first 2 games. I have become so sick of the same dungeons, and fields...I can't count how many times I've been into a blue dungeon idenical to the very first one in part 1 (infection) -The storyline has gone from intriguing, to bizzare and confusing. -the one and only new city looks ALOT like the 2nd city in .hack//infection (dun loriage), and it's very tiresome to shop there due to the fact the shops are very far apart and the graphics just repeat. - the game itself is incredibly short. - the DVD was also bizzare, and the story line (if there is one) was just a bunch of random events, and people talking about the epitath of twilight. The Good - the new characters are more colorful than the last. I was a huge .hack fan..now I feel jipped. I'm definately never buying from Bandai again.. rent it...you'll have no time completing it several times over in 4 days.	-1
4 short games, 50 dollars each. Now, 2 games would have been fine. 4 games is a joke. The creators are obviously trying to mooch all the money they can. The first game got repetitive. They have taken it to a whole new level. You still do the exact same things. If you find a great sword you can't use it, but you can give it to the person who wants it. If you get to the bottom theres a boss and a cutscene. Later you go into another dungeon that looks EXACTLY the same as the last one. The game fails to prove it's own worth. Now, if they only made 2 long games, as I have said, that would have been fine. Get a new engine guys, or a new concept. It doesn't work 4 times in a row.	-1
The game reproduces the world of the Simpsons faithful down to the humor and the voices. Unfortunately, as a video game it's more a test of memory than a game of challenge and skill. The more times you go through the maze the quicker you get. You can drive mostly any vehicle that comes along but it's best to stick with the assorted lots offered in the menu. I wanted badly to like this game since I love the Simpsons and got this game for the kids. They stopped playing it after running into so many false level-endings. That's where I took over fresh from playing "Need for Speed: Underground". You become various characters driving around Springfield to find clues to a mystery regarding black vans and crop circles. The automatic camera controls are by far the worst. It jumps erratically from chase view to overhead view if you get stuck in a tight corner or running on foot. This greatly interferes with game play. The physic's gravity is terrible. I had my car hanging on the pier edge forever unable to decide whether to fall or not. The graphics is 3-D cartoon. At times, I find myself manually circling the camera several times to see where items are positioned and where the ledges are "really" located to jump on. The vehicle jump cam is also a big problem. It's set to "On" by default but can be turned "Off" in Options. It's no good if I can't see where you're going to land after doing a ramp jump. The task themselves are simple but after getting to a certain location or collecting such and such an items under a time limit, the player is then immediately tasked to go to another location before time runs out to start yet another part of the level.  There can be 2-4 parts to these levels and failure at anytime along the way results in the player starting the level all over. There is no way for anybody other than the programmers themselves to get through all the levels the first time. The game is unforgiving making a wrong turn or get stuck by a car will mean doing the level over. There's no room for error. When tasked to go to a location, you have to rely heavily on the overlay map and green arrows on the road to know where to go while dodging pedestrians and vehicles that to me seem to have a death wish to jump into the path of your vehicle. Hitting the items gains you coins. Another problem is that some items you can crash through and some items are solid like the Rock of Gibraltar. There's no way to tell the difference without trial and error. If too many items are hit in a certain amount of time then the police comes in hot pursuit of you. If you're caught; you pay a 50 coin fine. Finally, the game cheats the player by running over your character trying to get to your vehicle, placing your vehicle way down the street or  stopping the game with time still left on the clock. I'm sure that the creators licensed the game to the video game developers and may have even wrote a basic story plot but as the video game part it's totally weak. By changing the XBOX's clock to holiday dates like Christmas, Springfield will change it's appearance to match the holiday moods. This is true of Halloween, Thanksgiving, etc. It's good enough just to drive around Springfield and forget the missions.	-1
My favorite genre of games are survival horror. This game isn't as good as Silent Hill three. Plus it won't sell good because many parents won't let their kids buy this game. The Suffering is also scary, but not like Silent Hill 3. The graphics aren't great and it's too gory. Their is a lot of pointless gore. They tried to make it like a Grand Theft Auto with more Gore. If you want a better game check out Fatal Frame 2 or Silent Hill 3. These are better games.	-1
I don't recommend this game, grainy graphics, poor history and all the game is very dark, it deserves a try, not the buy !!	-1
I am a huge Buffy fan from back when the TV Show first started. I own all the box sets that are released and I own the FIRST BTVS game for Xbox. I bought this game yesterday at GameSpot for 49.99 without tax. My husband played it for 5 minutes, we looked at each other and agreed, this game BLOWS. It is NOTHING like the first BTVS game on XBox. The graphics are like a PS2 game, most of the time your characters look like they are floating in thin air! The voice acting of the characters is way off including the cast that is actually in the TV Series. They seem like their hearts are not in it. Plus there is no Alyson to voice Willow. Some girl voice actor they hired is doing our favorite witch...except she is majorly annoying, her voice is NOTHING like season 4-7 Willow, and she really doesn't know how to act at all. All in all this game is a real huge disappointment. Do yourself a favor, don't run out and blow your money buying it like I did. Rent it and see if you like it...then if you do fork over the dough. I promise you, if you are a fan of the First Xbox Buffy game you will want to kill the people who made Chaos Bleeds for ruining a great game. I hate that it wasn't good. I hate that it did not meet my expectations...hated it so much I took it back today, traded it in for 20 dollars (way under what I paid) and bought Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic instead.	-1
Disc looked like it was run over by a truck!	-1
Disc is scratched. Have to get it resurfaced. Thanks for nothing.	-1
I received this game from Cartridges Galore, and when I put it in my GameCube it keeps telling me that it can't read the disc. It worked for a while when I tried restarting the system a few times, but at certain points of the game it gives me issues. I would highly recommend not buying games that is lower than a "Good" condition or if the company hasn't tested it properly it before putting it on Amazon.	-1
The ONLY thing I liked about this game was that you could beat up little kids, which is fun, admit it. I was dissapointed, being a huge fan of the show.	-1
This game is not a perfect and exciting game. Sorry Simpson fans but the game is not the best. You can play as Homer, Bart, Apu, Marge and Lisa but you don't really play them much on foot. You just stick to driving around in cars. The missions are repetative. You have to crash a car and destroy it, get in a race against a CPU, hit a viechal and collect the stuff that falls out... not a lot of diffrent ideas. The jokes made gave me a laugh or 2 but they felt more forced than funny. Also, you only have 3 locations you play at with the 7 levels. The only diffrence is the time they take place with a few notable changes. It kind of kills the fun by level 4. There are collector cards but the rewards for them almost feel unworth it. Plus, in the bonus races, it feels like any car you use easily knocks you aside making it near immposible to win. Sorry Simson fans. I say this game was rushed, underdeveloped and its hard to make it to the end of the game without quitting.	-1
I think  this game was a complete knock-off of Grand Theft Auto only with a lot less violence and the only funny part is when you hit people and the character says something. The levels are outrageously easy and theres really nothing to do after you beat the game. There are also about forty cars in the game and most of them are stupid. Do not buy this game reapeat do not buy this game it is too easy.	-1
I read some where that this is the simpsons version of Grand theftouto. Yeah Right! This horrible game is nothing like Grand Theftouto. First off, you don't get to kill ANYONE! All you can do is kick them and they just roll on the ground! The police thing is horrible to. In Grand Theftouto, you get a chance to fight the police and even get there guns, but in this if the just come close to you they take your money and the game keeps going. Oh, and instead of throwing people out of the car and taking the car like in Grand Theftouto, you friendly ask the person for a ride and they drive you were you want to go. The missions can not be compared at all with Grand Theftouto. in Grand theftouto, your missions are to kill somone, but in this one of your missions is to give Lisa her homework before the princable gets to school. If you love Grand Theftouto and is thinking of getting this it is nothing like Grand Theftouto. Infact, I would not recamend this game to anyone.	-1
this game can be described in one word. mediocre the graphics are poor and since when is the family car a convertible? missions are tedious and arn't even fun. if you get the police on you there's no running all they do is ticket you if they get within 20 yards... Rent don't buy	-1
Nothing special about this game.  It's another first person shooter but with monsters, creepy backgrounds, and creepy cut scenes.  Okay if you like those type of games.	-1
this game is unfair garbage enemies constantley block while the other one hits you from behind kakistos ia unfair ass . he throws firebals hits you when your down and gets four hits on  your slayer ever time the people who made this game are jerks  its no suprise vivendi is  gone don't buy this unfair garbage	-1
Coordinating with a joystick, seems that the game is slow than I thought when only in flightmode. While in game, its like your digging into a packed storage, looking at boring furniture.	-1
The price and delivery of the product was as advertised.  The problem was I purchased this game because the requirements of another Jet Fighter sim indicated that I had to have FS2002 or FS2004 loaded first.  The first three disks loaded no problem, the last disk began to load and then stopped.  So, I can't load or play this game as well as the other game I purchased.  Not happy.	-1
The program gets lost in the tutorials and can't correct itself.  If you can't do exactly what the program says to do when the program says to do it, the only way out is to crash the plane and restart the flight.  Thus, one is unable to make any progress.  It looked so great, too...	-1
A friend lent me his copy of this game - aCoF to evaluate on my machine, just to save me from the possibility of paying full price for a game that won't work well on my machine. I had by then become a devotee of the next newer version - FS2002. While aCoF obviously surpasses FS-2002 on a frame-by-frame basis, comparitive frame-rate more than evened things out for the older game. I knew that the minimum system requirements were conservative, but nothing prepared me for how conservative they were. Despite only "requiring" a 450mhz-class CPU & 128mb of RAM, aCoF ran like a slide-show on my 2.2 Ghz Pentium 4, w 512 MB of RAM, with GeForce graphics acceleration - and that was with options sliders set to 0 or near it. Apparently, software manufacturers like MS believe that they're past the days of having to set the minimum sys-req at half the optimum - now we have to multiply by five to get an honest idea of what's really needed. Though a better graphics accelerator and more RAM, would improve things, personally I'm happy enough with FS2002, and that program looks to have a more permanent place on my PC.	-1
Speaking only from East round experience on Diablo 2 expansion platform. This sixteen-year-old game has more bugs flaws issues with timed out, dropped games comma games that will time out and " rollback" your character to a prior level. I've played this game for many years and I cannot avocate enough to you as a consumer to look elsewhere for gameplay. If you use blizzards General discussion website on battle net they are technical support for Legacy games is not even comical. It's insulting When they consistently close down east round and put a vague and biguous one sentence statement during 8 Hour maintenance. That they're having technical issues. That's your cue to forget this game move on. I am. Gameplay is supposed to be about fun. With all these technical issues, even after 16 years blizzard Corporation does not have its act together. They must have a fantastic marketing program for their new games. This one needs to be put to pasture Or better since it's so old basic and its Graphics are very archaic should be structured for cellular phones or tablets.	-1
NO WONDER THEY KEEP DELAYING THIS PIECE OF CRAP,I LOVED ALL THE OTHER GAMES SO I AM DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME!!ITS SO BAD I DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO FINISH OUT THE LEVEL WHICH IS RARE? WANT A ROCKING GAME? TRY "XIII" I LOVED IT!!!	-1
Of all the Syphon Filter games I've played (the first 4), this is absolutely the worst.  Everything that made the first 3 games great has been changed.  You no longer can take your time and sneak up on enemies.  You are forced to rush with arbitrary time limits.  Now, true, there were time limits in some of the levels of the previous 3, but, in this game, EVERY level must be beaten at a certain time to complete all objectives.    You can progress without completing all objectives, though... which is dumb, cuz you would immediately be sent back to the last checkpoint in the previous 3 once you messed up one objective.  And the time limits are much harder than even the second filter game.  I hate how this game stresses me out.    Syphon Filter 4 took a great series that was unique and made it bad.  Goldeneye and Perfect Dark are also much like the first three Syphon Filters.  This game is horrible compared to any of these games.    Finally, the constant respawning of enemies is dumb too.  I don't want to fight infinite guys.  I want to clear the level out at my own pace and, at some point, REACH AN END.  You can't do that in this game.    DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  Sincerely, Ultima Slacker	-1
I thought I wasted my time writing a review on this crap, but apparently not.  I played it for about an hour and wanted to get rid of it the same day.  Syphon Filter used to be a sure thing, but now it's up the creak without a paddle.  The controls suck, the mission objectives are unclear, and the map is hard to read.  I'd swear the developers that made the previous Syphon Filter editions enjoyable retired and passed on the torch to the makers of "No One Lives Forever."  That game is as fun as having your your legs broken twice a year, every year, for 10 years straight.  I'd give this game 1/2 star if it were possible.	-1
Im a huge fan of the Syphon Filter frachise.  I own and beat all 3 of the original and ones for ps1 and let me tell you when I got this one I was dissapointed and pissed.  First of all I would like to know why the hell your not Gabe Logan in this game!?!?!  Sure you can create your own agent but it doesnt feel like a Syphon Filter game without good old Gabe!  Now he went from being a professional agent to doing paper work.  Well atleast you get to work for him or so you think.  Through the whole game your taking orders from this annoying women(that I cant remember her name) who is always  freaken  yelling and being a smart ass every time you make a mistake. They could of atleast had Gabe tell you what to do because I would respect his opinion at least. Second of all this game is freaken hard.  Your enemies take like 15 shots each even at point blank range and your freaken map is impossible to freaken read.  And your enemies continue to come back to life. You kill all the enemies then you leave then you go back there and all of them are alive shooting you again. I also didn't know what the hell was going on half the time.  All the sudden it would say "OBJECTIVE FAILED" and im like "what objective?".  Plus in order to beat the game 100% you have to play online.  WHAT THE F***!!!! Since when has anyone made a game were you have to be online to beat it 100%.  I did like a couple things about the game.  It had pretty good graphics and the sound effects were also very realistic.  But overall it just didn't feel like a Syphon Filter game to me. It just had too many mistakes and was just way to frusturating.  Hopefully the next time SONY makes a Syphon Filter game they'll make it right this time!!!!	-1
Game arrived with scratches. On playing, freezes on Insomniac's boot logo.	-1
Purchased to refresh my memory.  I use one star because to identify that I bought this item from Amazon and not to review.	-1
It was a good game to begin with but gets very repititive very soon . played only like 24% of the game and now i will probably never play it again.	-1
"Jet Li: Rise to Honor" is a third person brawling and shooting game. In the game, the player takes the role of Jet Li - or rather, a character virtually portrayed by him.  The story is a fairly simple, revolving around Chinese gangs and criminal elements. Jet Li - or the player - is Kit Yun, a bodyguard responsible for protecting Boss Chiang, who is attempting to leave his life of crime behind. Most of the story involves beating up other gang members who are trying to kill Chiang or, later, his daughter, and the story serves mostly as an excuse for this violence.  The gameplay is simple compared to many other brawler games: aside from guarding and area-specific actions, fighting occurs by pushing ("slapping", in the game's words) the right control stick in the direction that you want to attack. This allows for multidirectional attacking in the game's many multi-opponent fights. This simplifies combat almost to the point where it's not fun anymore; the only other action is "adrenaline attacks", which is basically slow motion or bullet time. Gun battles work roughly the same way, except the control stick is used to target and the R2 button is used to shoot. Apart from some neat interactive features, like kicking people into equipment or onto hot stoves, there isn't a lot of gameplay variety.  The graphics are decent, but not good. Faces are reasonably good, but also tend to be blocky. The textures range from mediocre to poor, with too much blur and not enough detail. The action, despite some neat slow-motion moments, is generally lackluster as well. The sound is for the most part forgettable and consists mainly of yelling in Chinese.  "Mediocre" describes this game fairly well. At most parts, it simply drags as you are forced to fight yet another wave of hooded thugs, and it lacks excitement and panache.  4/10.	-1
I rented this game hearing it was but is awful. the controls r all with the analog and r and l buttons which is very stupid in hand 2 hand fighting, while gun fighting and sword fighting fun the controlls r still hard and the enemies is very and theres a diffculty level except u have  to unlock on my opininon definately rent this game and don't buy it cause u get tired of it pretty soon	-1
Any enjoyment you might derive from this game is from playing as Jet Li in an old-school fight setting.  When the novelty of that wears off, what you have left is an incredibly repetitive game with a godawful camera and an ill-advised control scheme.  Yes, bonus marks are in order for using Cantonese in Hong Kong with subtitles.  (As a native Hong Kong person I can say the dialogue is less stilted than usual, though still flawed)  Though I might add that international espionage games like Syphon Filter has been doing that for years.  The settings are authentic enough, with the battles in the Hong Kong settings being especially evocative of kung fu films.  But is it worth the very problematic gameplay?  Just barely.  If you've seen/played the demo already, you'll know that the entire fight system consists of slapping the right analog stick.  While the array of moves you can unleash is impressive, motion-captured well from Li's own silhouette, this system is very ill conceived from a fighting-game perspective.  Worse still, the camera is so restless that you could be in the middle of a combo against an enemy, and then the perspective shifts so that you're suddenly hitting at air and the enemy's to the side.  So many game designers have misled notions about being filmmakers, not realizing that the best perspective for gaming is a fixed perspective.  This problem came to a head during the ludicrous "escape from capture" stage where the camera actually cuts you off, preventing you from seeing what's behind you, even though there are guards sweeping flashlights that way that you're supposed to avoid!  This is simply a moronic use of the camera.  Aside from this, the fighting gets tired awfully quickly, especially since the designers committed the ol' "this level never ends" sin.  This game alleviates this problem by having lots of checkpoints where you can continue the game, but during some of the "one against 14" stages, the endless brawling still gets tired.  And whose idea was it to have enemies pull off 18-hit combos, where if you get hit the first time, you get to watch your character get pummelled for 10 seconds straight?  I actually find the gunfight segments of this game more fun than the endless, endless hand-to-hand stages.  This is where the dual analog sticks truly shine, allowing you to smoothly run from spot to spot forwards and backwards while your hands can aim independently and a top button allows you to do Time Crisis-style ducking.  There's even a crazy level where you fight off about 100 enemies with two nailguns!  This game would probably remain tempting to Jet Li fans because of the role-playing aspect of it.  And I wouldn't blame them -- this was my reason for buying this game, and there are a few levels that I truly enjoyed.  The overall game, however, is really not that great, and I would recommend only playing it in small doses.  It will get tired mightily quickly if you sit with it for more than an hour.	-1
the first SOCOM game was amazing, and now with the release of SOCOM II, Zipper interactive was looking to make an even better hit. But...  As so many sequals to anything are, this one didn't exacally nail it on the button like the first one did. For starters, the game is extreely easy compared to the first one. Secondly, the graphics aren't exacally what you'd expect for a second game, they are almost just a little worse in comparison to the first game. The Ai isn't all that, and it's more about mindless terrorist flying themselves at you than they are shooting at you.  I will grant that the health bar addition is good, and your buddies are a little smarter than the first one, but in addition, their accurecy isn't like the first one. It's like they lost the "One shot, one kill" saying. There are only two levels that proved challenging, and it is because the stealth was an absolute must on Admiral [the highest hard].  I guess since the first one was a surprise, it made me expect more out of this one, but, I didn't get what i was expecting. There are a few really fun levels, but overal, not really worth it, unless you just want to say you've played it.   This one could have been so much better, if only they made it harder, it would be challenging. For 20 bucks a pop though, it isn't so bad. But I do recomend the first one instead of this one.  Hooyah...	-1
Sure, the game *could* be great on-line game. But its unforgiveable flaws turn what could be something of a classic into an ulcer-inducing experience.  Let's re-cap:  1). The load-up time is just criminal! It takes--what--five minutes or so (I'm being nice) between the time that the CD first starts to load and when the player finally connects to the on-line system. Life is too short. This is atrocious. Check out games like "Amplitude", "Tribes" or Hell, even "Socom 1" and the load-up/log-in time is never more than a minute.  2). "Network Cable is Disconnected". An error message that for no reason pops up once, twice even three times during the boot-up/log-in process (worse now with the recent patch). Not that the network cable really is disconnected, by the way. And once the error message appears the only resort is to re-boot the game. Takes the player all the way to the title screen. Start the clock and watch another five minutes of loading drip by. This problem happens routinely to most players.  3). The scoring system. Zipper has refused to comment on the exact algorithm that they use for their zany scoring system. Don't try to figure it out. Win a round--your rank may go up or down...lose a round--your rank may go up or down. Who knows? The on-line joke is that even Zipper has lost control over it. Most players have long since abandoned trying to make sense of it. Even with the new patch the logic of the scoring system remains a mystery.  4). Unpredictable on-line gameplay. When the disclaimer pops up and reveals that "Online experience may change during gameplay", they ain't-a kidding! Lag-issues aside, whole servers sometimes crash for no reason, microphones work...then they don't and players are bounced from a game all the way back to the load up screen--you now get rewarded with another five minutes wait before you can get back in the game (unless you get the "Network Cable..." error again--!).  5). The Patch. What kind of PS2 game has to require you to download patches to fix the bugs? And then what kind of game uses patches that fix problems but creates still more problems?  The darn game already eats up the bulk of my memory card. I don't have room to keep downloading these things. The first patch was released in late February of 2004. The second in mid-September of 2004. If there's a third--why not just release a whole darn new game?  Okay. In the plus category, there are three: 1). 22 maps and they all look very gorgeous, 2). the social-interactive component of the game sets a standard for others to follow and 3). the game prevents Game Sharkers/cheaters.  That's a half-compliment. Glitchers (different from cheaters) will find new ways to exploit the game...and will eventually bring it down.  Socom 1 had none of these problems. That game was destroyed by cheaters. Socom 2 smells suspicously of a game that was rushed out for Christmas at the expense of proper beta-testing. If Zipper could go back to the first game's program code and yet keep out the cheaters...well, then they will have a game worthy of five stars.  Or maybe someone else will come along and blow this game out of the water.	-1
Well, Sony has done it again; they have made a completely horrific game, and I don't mean horrificly good, i mean horrificly bad.  PlayStation 2 is too choppy and the framerate is too slow to run a half-decent game.  They release SOCOM II, and Xbox releases Rainbow Six 3, and I know what you're gonna say: "Rainbow Six 3 is on all 3 systems", well it's only actually GOOD on the Xbox.  No matter what Sony tries, Microsoft will always be two steps in front of them.	-1
I hated this game. It is too hard.  As soon as you start, boom you are dead. It takes FOREVER to get better in the game because when u are a beginner, the whole game is practically better than you. Ya so what, people shoot at each other in teams like the us navy seals. Even if you start to do bad, just a little  bad, they will all vote you out and you will leave that room and you cant go back in.  What if you are just new and you cant help it?  Then for awhile you wouldnt be able to go into any room. And say your teammate was there and someone from the other team was running in front of him, you shoot him and just barely miss and hit your teammate. You tell them sorry, like I did and they still....vote you out.  I have played a million games like that, that are much better.  Try out Americas Army.  It is MUCH better! This game is a huge waste! waste waste waste DO NOT GET IT.	-1

Oh lord do I hate this video game! It completely changes the Jak and Daxter theme, it's dark and painful in the beginning, I hate Baron Praxis, and there are way too many objectives to do in this game! this sequel does a terrible job living up to its predecessor! Why couldn't they have made this a "Banjo-Tooie" kind of sequel: villains rising back from the dead, wanting revenge on the heroes, heroes need to stop them again! That would have been a lot more interesting!	-1
The game's not hard. The developers just disabled the right thumb stick, which makes it a frustrating game... but not hard at all. And it's not the first time i've ever played a game where the developers disabled the right thumb stick, (ninja gaiden black, metro prime), thereby not allowing me to control the camera so that I could adequately play the game. The other platform game, (Sly Cooper), allowed me to move the right thumb stick "UP AND DOWN" so that I can effectively make jumps.  Jak 2 however, doesn't allow me to move the camera up and down, and this resulted in me making a lot of "BLIND JUMPS" which sent me back to the beginning of EVERY mission. The game also could have benefited from having a camera system that didn't get stuck a lot and follows the movements of Jak faster, weapons with lock on features, and the ability for the player to strafe around an enemy like in the Zelda series.  Ok now, let me put the brakes on the bitching for a moment. Jak 2 is "not" a terrible game.  There are some fun and funny moments to be had in the game. The open world areas are great, the music is cool, the pretty much non-existant load times are fantastic, character graphics are good, the story is decent, and amist the many chaotic scenes in the game that involves you fighting in various places and moving through the city, there's no slow down.  So the game does have a lot of good points about it.	-1
Jak & Daxter:  the Precursor Legacy was the first title in this series, and it very much set the standard on the Playstation for the Platformer genre.  I have played and beaten the prequel thoroughly, even getting the extra ending for finding all the Precursor Orbs. I loved the game from one end to the other.  When Jak 2 opens, it's clear that the story will be taking a new turn into a dark place:  our heroes are in a bad future, and we take control of Jak only after an interval (told through cutscenes) of his having been tortured and mutated.  It seemed to make for an interesting new take on the series, but very quickly you realize that unlike its predecessor, Jak II imitates more than it innovates.  Even worse, the imitation isn't even in the same genre:  Jak 2 dovetails its platformer formula into a more "sandboxed" open world that heavily mimics the Grand Theft Auto series.  I've played the GTA series and loved it, but here the fusion fails miserably.  As the storyline progresses, frustrating side quests and attempts to inject variety into the gameplay are quickly derailed by the fact that a single mistake blows the entire operation, bumping into someone during a race can trigger a full alert, and you can easily get shot out of the sky, have your vehicle explode out from under you, or find yourself surrounded by a never-ending stream of guards.  I'd like to say the awfulness ends there, but unfortunately the amount of effort quickly outweighs the payoff.  There are times when "puzzles" amount to "how often can you kill/smash things before you're caught and killed?"  In more than one sequence, you become convinced that Jack Thompson has finally found his "murder simulator":  the goal is to bang on the trigger, again and again, as fast as you can, while guards die screaming at your feet.  The difficulty is balanced by a bonus "Dark Jak" feature that makes you super-powerful. However this feature gets seriously annoying: it takes a lot of dark eco collecting to charge it up, and during these murder-fest stretches, it's all too easy to accidentally bang the lower trigger and blow your charge.  If you plan to use this power burst to get yourself through a difficult spot, if you don't survive to the checkpoint, you won't have it available to you again because there won't be enough Dark Eco lying around to recharge you.  Where I finally gave up on this game--at the 94% mark--was when the number of pointless conveyor belts with hard-to-reach switches over boiling lava and/or radiation pits made me realize that this was no longer "challenging", it was more like a test to see how angry the player could get before they take the disc out and throw it against the wall.  I have beaten many a game and put up with many, many death sequences, and in the end Jak killed my desire to go on far deader than any of the bodies I'd stacked along the way.  Not clever, not fun for long, and not recommended.	-1
This is one hard game! Jesus, and with no real cheat codes around to help. Most levels, you have to replay it so many times to beat the level. That is if you could.  Tell you the truth, it is so frustrating playing this game!	-1
I bought this game because I had played the first one, and it was fun, funny, and had the right level of challenge. I was looking forward to another cool action/platforming adventure. But that was NOT what I got.  From the very beginning, the lighthearted, madcap-cartoon tone of the first game is lost. Instead, characters are constantly angry, scowling, and generally put you in a bad mood. I hated Jak's new personality. I would rather him be a "mute" than this "angry young man" type.  In the first game, once you entered an environment, you could wander freely, grabbing Power Cells in any order that you wanted to. Not so in Jak II. Instead, you are given "missions". Now, mission-based gameplay is a pet peeve of mine, since I'm used to games where you figure out your objective on your own, so it may not bother people who are used to this type of thing. It does, however, make ME angry.  If the missions themselves were good, this wouldn't matter, but they're not. They're lame and repetitive to a fault. Shoot this...shoot that...beat this time...what happened to the creative objectives of the first Jak and Daxter?  The most grevious issue to me, however, is the controls. In the previous game, the simple platforming and combat let me concentrate freely on my goals. Here, you must use unwieldy guns and vehicles. What is this, Grand Theft Auto? With the vehicles, I was constantly crashing into things. Then the guards would come after me and shoot at me (yet another GTA copy). With the guns, targeting was terribly slow and clunky. I found it easier to just rush the enemy and punch it, which kind of took away the strategy.  I was just so disappointed with this game. After the fun I had with Jak and Daxter, I thought I would have another great series to play. Sadly, I was wrong.	-1
Jak 2 has got to be the worst game I have ever played, it has horrible gameplay, storyline, graphics and it just is crappy! I hope you don't waster your money on it! (...)	-1
Jak II is suposed to be cool but it isnt. Its a babyish game that was supposed to be cool. I have no idea why its reated T. It should be E or lower. It is almost the exact same thing as Jak and Daxter. Dont buy it even if you liked Jak and Daxter.	-1
When this game arrived at my house, I put it into the computer and a screen came up that said play, options, and something else. I did not say install, and it was supposed to. I called up echnical support, went online, nadda, nothing. The worst $20 I ever spent. Avoid this problem by avoiding this product. Don't let it happen to you. I recommend you get City of Heroes instead. Now theres a fun game.	-1
The area isn't exactly the fantacy world Jak and Daxter 1 was set in, that is one of my all time favorite games, everywhere he went it looked plesant, but this game is mostl building reuins, geto, and swamp. You have to check back in to the same location after each mission, and it's hard to find since everything looks the same, and when think you are about to find it you run into the sombody and a large attack begains; by the time you escape you have totaly lost your way again. Jak does have a cool hover board he can flip out at any time, and a laser rifel he can use to shoot the bad guys. I do like the hover vechiles that Jak can "jak" anytime they fly over head	-1
Jak and Dexter was a darn good platform game.  It was encompassing, awe inspiring, it had varied levels, it was pretty non-linear, the levels were lengthy yet doable.  It was basically a fun all around game.  So Jak 2 comes out, and they made a lot of changes, all for the worse. First off, I guess the marketing folks told the developers to emulate Grand Theft Auto 3.  Let me tell you, this does not work.  GTA had a living-breathing city that fit into the environment.  What does Jak 2 have?  It was a non-descript closed off city with hardly anything in it.  The worst is the movement throughout the city.  To go to a different a different part of the city, you need take this horrible "hover vehicle" that apparently can't hover beyond "up" or "down".  The movements of this vehicle are sluggish, slow, and uncontrollable, and the vehicle itself doesn't possess any subtlety.  Couple this with the fact that all the missions are clear cross the city, and the alleyways are small, and you've got one boring, annoying game.  I passed maybe 10 levels, and most of my time was spent hovering between those levels. Secondly, in GTA fashion, they decided to make it "gritty".  Oh geez, give me a break.  Who was begging for a cartoon platformer to be gritty?  Why does Jak need to cuss?  I don't mind it, but it serves no other purpose other than to alienate a chunk of potential gamers.  The "gritty" factor might have been an excuse as to why they could not re-produce the lush, varied environments that really made the first game.  Every level I played looked the same, either an indoor level or an outdoor level. Okay, so the environment and movement is no good, what about the missions you say?  Well, these missions are tedious missions and designed to be repeated over and over again.  Some of the missions are easy, but you basically go through the same jumps and enemies over and over again.  Many are difficult, made so that you have to die a few times, repeat what you just accomplished, just to die a little bit later.  While not hard, but if the missions were any fun, it wouldn't be so bad. Finally, the first game required you to reach a certain number of spheres for you to pass.  Whatever way you wanted to get them, you could.  This meant that if a mission was boring, not fun, or out of the way, you could skip and try something else.  This game pretty much is linear.  It's sort of de-evolution of video gaming right here. So, in short, what was once an original, fun, lush platform game now spawned a sequel which is no more than a badly designed conglomeration or random gaming ideas. Pros: Uhmm, I can't think of any. Cons: Pretty much linear. City is mundane. Environments unvaried, stale. Repetitive, tedious levels. Adult for no reason. Hover system is mind boggling bad. Difficulty: Medium Frustration Level: High Hours to complete (my estimate): 25 Hours	-1
The game starts off with an intersting opending and quickly goes down hill from there. As soon as Jak opens his mouth to speak, I began to have my doubts. Everything he says he is nasty and his vocal tones are those of the nastiest villians. Granted he is supposed to be under the influence of dark forces and he is grumpy from two years of torture, but still he sounds more like a stock villian then a hero whose fate you are supposed to care about it. The level designs are also unrelentedly difficult. From the very beginning you are faced with challenging moving platforms and with a couple of levels you will be chased by a relentless cannon while jumping blind repeatedly. Poor camera angles, lack of camera control in crucial areas, make already difficult jumps nearly impossible as judging depth is often not possible  and more often then not you are forced to jump blind because you can not see where you need to go next. Rarely is there is no time to pause to study your move and try to rotate the camera (which at some crucial spots simply refuses to budge) because crumbling ledges, firing cannons and their ilk force you to keep hopping from one awkward ledge to the next. You will be forced to endless repeat difficult segements, memorizing the exact route as you will often need to jump blind in order to complete levels. Finely you make it through a difficult segement only to fall off a tiny ledge that lures you off the side by tempting goodies, or shot by an unseen gun, only to be sent bake to the beginning, forced to repeat what you thought mastered until you eyes blur over and you forget why it is you are playing the game. Only sheer stuborness will force you to continue. When you are not being frustrated by the pooly paced and un-balanced levels, you will be bored by the endless travel by foot or awkward vehicals that you can steal, needed to get between levels, which the game refers to as missions. This aspect of the game might have been amusing as a single section but is otherwise pointless. The vehicals can only be flown at two heights and there is little room to manuver. Everyone just bangs into everyone else. It is like an endless game of bumper cars to get from one place to the other. Eventually, if you persist, you will realize that both the level difficulty and endless crisscrossings of the hub city to get to each level are only there to pad out what otherwise be a very brief game. It's a shame really, because the story is interesting, the levels bright and intriguing and with just a bit of tuning could have been really fun rather then really frustrating. If ND really wanted to be innovative, there would have a variable level of difficulity and maturity settings. As it is this game will only appeal to the teenager or adult who finds most platforms a piece of cake and longs for a real challenge.	-1
Jak 2 is one of the worst games i've played in years!  With unfair levels, difficult situations (like I.E. You agaist and Amry with one gun with only 50 bullets)and frustrating mini games , like keep up with the old lady you have 1 second per symbol.  I spend more time yelling than enjoying the game.  I sugest if your a fan of theof Jak 1 don't getthis game.  Jak acts more like a criminal than a hero.  All i can say is that this game is not worth the money.  DON'T GET JAK 2!	-1
Day of Defeat is basically counter-strike with an attempted WWII setting.  It does not, nor will it ever feel like Saving Private Ryan, and whoever told you that this was an epic WWII game needs to get their head examined.  While not a bad idea in itself, the game fails to convey the meaning of war.  It is simply a pretty display of new textures and skins, and a lame attempt at character classes a la Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  In the end, it is a mediocre spinoff that screams counter-strike.  The levels feel cramped and it feels like you're playing laser-tag in a room rather than fighting a war out on the fields of battle.  There are few maps and even fewer players actually playing the game.  The Omaha level is a nice try (for the millionth time), but still no cigar.  Consult Medal of Honor or Battlefield 1942 on how to get this level right.  The game is multiplayer ONLY and requires a somewhat fast connection (cable is preferred).  As far as system specifications go, it's the outdated half-life engine with new textures and you should be able to run it with the old system that's collecting dust in the attic.  Purchase at your own risk or download for free if you have half-life or retail version of counter-strike.  But if you really must have a WWII game with freedom of movement, so you don't feel like a rat in a maze...skip this title and get Battlefield 1942 instead.	-1
Like a lot of other deceptions, this game is NOT for Windows XP. Baldur's Gate couldn't be programed by official company or fansite(as with Ultima) to run on XP.  It is not possible. The same could be said for Ultima Collecton which stated it was for windows 95 RIGHT ON THE BOX and doesn't run on that os.  Please put the correct OS for this game. Deception #2:  This game only contains what BG Saga contained, Baldur's Gate.  It is not an "Ultimate" Collection, so don't expect BG II or ToB. It is just another name for the same thing(and for bux) bottom line, if you have BG, stick with it and play it on your old windows 98 system that your so fortunate to own, don't mess with this! If you don't have BG(by now) then your too young to appreciate it!	-1
I just bought this game, the reviews here made it sound great. I am a huge never winter nights fan and after playing that game for a very long time I just couldn't get past the graphics. They are awful. I am sorry but if you are used the graphics of today's games then this game isn't for you. I can't tell you if the game itself is fun to play, I haven't played it. I just couldn't get past the graphics. Sorry bad review from me.	-1
This game falls short for 12 unit selection and a low max pop limit, as well as atrocious graphics and stupid editor limitations. The story is decent, but everything else falls short. The Armies of Azeroth mod for SC2 isn't coming out anytime soon if at all. BLIZZARD GIVE US WARCRAFT IV OR REMADE W3 ASSETS IN THE EDITOR AND DON'T LIE TO US THIS TIME DANGIT!	-1
Like everyone else said, if you have Mavericks, this game is no longer supported.  If you have a PC, go for it.  Wish Blizzard would have updated it to allow it to run, but they have newer games to pay attention to.	-1
this game has a great effects trailer, but when you play, there's no fun modes, you don't know what to do, and the graphics are crap and piece of s*** worthy, a 100% letdown.	-1
I've been playing RTS games since Dune 2 came out, this is by far the worst example of an RTS I've ever played. It has the most tedious interface of any game... any program I've ever used. The entire challenge of this game is trying to control your units when the simplest commands are unavailable. Select all units? No, you can't, you simply cannot do it. Amazing. After 2 hours of playing this I threw it in the garbage.	-1
I inserted my "Advance Wars" game into this device and the game stopped working. In other words, my game cartridge is now defective and a useless piece of plastic. I had to buy another copy.  I took a fool-hardy chance and tried another cartridge in the changer and it worked. But I'll be honest, I'm too nervous to use this thing anymore, because the changer is less-than $5 and video games are expensive, especially these Gameboy classics.  Use this changer at your own risk, but I would give you my recommendation not to use it at all. Afterall, what's so hard about swapping cartridges? I was foolish in thinking this would make my gaming experience any better.	-1
This game will stink like the rest of em'.Madden makes the worst football games ever. If you want a fast paced football game go for the 2k series,if you want the best graphics get nfl fever 2004 instead of this. Why do people like the boring games that EA sports dishes out?	-1
I have always been a big fan of the series and I love the mini camp drills, i think thats a brilliant idea. The ability to set concession prices, hats, etc. is also a clever addition. The graphics are solid, though still need tweaking but I feel as if I am playing Madden 2004 Blitz. I am sick and tired of the computers magical ability to erase any deficit in the 4th quarter. Mind you, I have been playing football games, including Madden, for years. I have had the Cardinals come back to beat me in the 4th quarter, erasing a 24 point lead. This quarter from hell included, 1. a blocked punt, 2. a punt returned for a td, 3. 2 fumbles by my rb (Ahman green) who was running great until this dreadful quarter. 4. a td return for a td 5. and a game winning 90 yard drive by the cardinals. Sure this can happen once, twice, whatever. But when I constantly lose 4th quarter leads over and over again, it annoys me. I love games that are hard but this computer assistance borders on the surreal and it is enough for me to spoil an otherwise terrific game. One last gripe, too much room for the QB to run. This is not NCAA. I think this was done to appease Mike Vick fans and I guess I can understand and live with that.	-1
I'll keep this review fairly short.  If you have played Madden 2003 then that is pretty much what 2004 is.  2004 added more gimmicks like playmaker control and owner mode where you can basically set the price of hotdogs and hamburgers in your stadium.  This is unimportant to me, I would have liked to have seen EA use the extra spare time they used in adding more gimmicks and improve the obvious cheating "come-back" AI.  Aside from it being the same game as 2003, the AI is one of the main reasons I have not actually bought this game.  If EA fixed their problems first then added gimmicks then I would consider purchasing this game, however they did not.  IF EA ever decides to improve their problems like unrealistic CPU AI then maybe I will buy Madden titles again, but as it stands Madden 2003 (and NCAA 2003) will be my last EA title(s).	-1
There is no Defense in the game and you don't really feel like your skill can do anything to help on defense. You can't control DBs well so its better to just let the computer do it and they can be picked a part by any Human with a little experience with Madden. Offense is all about who has the fastest players and getting it to them which is easy because every QB in the game has the ability to make throws that shouldn't be possibe.	-1
You want a real good football game, NCAA Football 2004. Madden has great graphics and extras but the game feels to arcady to me. Obviously my opinion differs from the rest of you.	-1
Unlimited Saga is a terrible RPG in almost every way. The graphics are horrid, both in the cutscenes and in the game. The music is subpar and cliche'. The game system is completely unintuitive, both on the world map and in combat scenes. The voice acting is disgustingly bad. The city menu is limited and almost useless. If you are a fan of RPGs you may get a few scraps of fleeting amusement out of this game, otherwise you are in trouble. Avoid this game at all costs.	-1
OMG I made the mistake of buying this game. How awful Square. How COULD YOU!? Let me count the ways:  Visually, Unlimited SaGa characters & backgrounds aren't animated--everything is entirely static. The only place you get anything resembling modern graphics is in the battle sequences, which feature sprite-based characters and rudimentary 3D backgrounds. So if you like the game's art style, you'll probably enjoy looking at it for a little while, but if you're looking for more-modern graphical fare, Unlimited SaGa won't be the slightest bit exciting. The game's catalog of sound effects is understandably limited, since little of it plays out in anything like an action scene, and the voice acting ranges from bad to horrible. The soundtrack is really good and the only saving grace. I advise buying the soundtrack and PASSING UP the actual game....  The game's field scenes play out like some ultra bizarre RPG board game. Your character is represented by a tiny static sprite, and you move in hops along preset paths that are presented to you. Each movement may present some form of obstacle or curiosity--you can be attacked, encounter a pitfall, or discover a treasure chest, for instance. None of these are visible on the board, however, so you'll end up stumbling blindly into things quite a bit. This system of exploration, which doesn't actually let you explore much at all, comes off as stilted and constraining. It's also horribly plodding and makes the movement portion of the game feel like a chore.  Interactions with townspeople, and indeed all the dialogue sequences in the game, play out with mere static character portraits and comic-book-style text bubbles. When you're tired of moving a cursor around the town background, you can head to the inn and see what adventures can be undertaken. Sometimes these adventures tie into your character's storyline, but other times they serve no apparent purpose, and after embarking on one you often have to wonder exactly why you're doing what you're doing. The whole process, which is meant to advance the game's plot, ends up being incredibly nonsensical.  Think of USaga as a point & click adventure. Click mouse, move character, fight battle, collect gold, move to next fight.  Super boring, repetitive, totally lacking of innovation...yup that is Unlimited Saga.	-1
Bought this game very cheap, as it is from a publisher I normally love and trust.  Hailed as being an "extreme" RPG, I thought a little challenge could be fun (just got done played a series of fun, but easy games.)  Plus, it was cheap.  This RPG game is only "extreme" in how bad it is...  The difficulty in this game comes from a completely random, roulette wheel battle style, and the fact that every challenge in the game require level 30+ skills to overcome, when you're at level 2.  Seriously, you will encounter a barrel, a door, or a treasure chest and not be able to do anything, right at the beginning of the game.  You later find out it takes a level 30 skill to break or open anything.  So, you walk around what is basically a board game playing field, moving a stationary character drawing one space at a time, while random pictures flash in the background.  Occasionally you get in a random battle, which is where the roulette attack wheel comes in.  All your skills are put on a fast spinning wheel, and what you land on is what you do.  Or, you encounter a trap.  If this happens, you use the same wheel to try and avoid it, which it early levels, is something like a 1/19 odds.  The battles present another huge problem.  You have your standard HP, and you have LP.  LP is your life points, and if a character is attacked while in KO (after HP reaches 0, typically) you lose an LP, and when LP is gone, you're dead for real.  You get shocking little LP... like 2 or 3 at most... which wouldn't be too much of a problem except tiny monsters in random battles do LP damage while you still have full HP!  So, at full HP, a 2 hit kill monster can hit you for an unavoidable 2 LP... possibly killing a character.  This makes HP completely useless...  I never found an item that could cure LP, either.  There are multiple characters you can play, with different storylines.  A good feature, but the stories (played out through a very few still picture/word sequences) were bland and confused, and none of them sparked my interest enough to possibly warrent played through such an unfun wreck of a game.  Not even worth the incredibly cheap price and shipping.  Stay away.  If you want an "extreme" or challenging RPG with great story, great gameplay try the Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga series.	-1
Don't bother to know what it is. I bought it at around $10. Worst than the Final Fantasy's series. Worst than the Dark Cloud series. Worst than the Star Ocean's series. "Something" that should have never seen the light. Not even worth 1 star (but is required to put at least 1).	-1
I bought this game a while ago, when it was at list price, played it after playing several other RPG's, and was stunned,,, but not in a good way.  I gave up after about 4 hours of play and decided I wasn't getting it.  I tried again a month later and lasted 10 hours, still thought that there might be something that I didn't understand.  My last try was about 15 hours, and I can state unequivocally that there is nothing to get.  This is not a good game, not even a mediocre one, for that matter. Perhaps the single most glaring flaw is the non-existent animation.  Outside of some cut scenes and so-so battle action this is in what Square Enix calls "sketch motion" which means - no motion at all.  So help me, one character's sketch appears with a balloon of text, then another, then...  Throw in a barebones mapping facility that does the travel and you have the entire art effort.  This isn't a game, it's a prototype for one. The battle system is almost as bad.  You have to set up all your characters' moves ahead of time, one painstaking button press at a time.  Then, when the action actually starts you have to hit a button while a battle wheel spins.  Most of your opponents actually die of boredom. The story line is doled out in bite-sized bits but what I've seen is pretty run of the mill.  Playing Unlimited Saga is actually painful, as you follow a set of meaningless actions using a game structure that was out of style in 1995.  the best I can say about is that Square Enix must have cancelled the game before the animation, and has published it to try to recoup their investment. Unless you collect total failures, pass this one by.	-1
As much as Squaresoft's Final Fantasy X was quite possibly the best RPG title ever released in recent memory, Unlimited Saga left me scratching my head and wondering what happened to the production and planning committee that put this game together. Lets look at the graphics. There are limited cut sceens and FMVs and little if any, character animation. If I didn't know it was for a PS2 machine, I would have sworn that the game was produced for the PS1. The graphics aren't bad, but considering the power of the PS2, these graphics are way under par with present day standards. All the art is two-dimensional in nature. Basic game play centers on moving your character from place to place on a world map. You and your party do not walk anywhere, you merely jump from map location to map location. When arriving at a destination, you are presented with another map where you also , move from place to place. Typical of all RPGs, your chracters gain skills and abilities as you continue through the game. The battle system is pretty straight forward with an element of chance. Upon the start of a battle, spining circles appear and you have the chance to bring mulitple attacks on the enemy, depending on where you stop the wheels. Your characters do not accumulate experience points as with standard RPGs but instead, you try to protect your characters from losing their LP, or Life Points. You finish each adventure by completing an assignment without losing all your LP. There are seven characters in the game and each one has his or her specific adventure. So in reality, you have seven games in one. Each character has their own story line and specific powers. The weapons for each character have a specific usable lifespan. The more points the weapons have, the longer it will last. The weapons stop working when their durability is all used up. While the weapons are powerful, they do not last forever. You have to make sure that the weapons are only used for the really difficult monsters. During the other times, you can usually defeat the other baddies by using kicks, punches and throws. How fun is this game? Speaking personally, I do not think the game is that entertaining. There is a lot of repetition in the battles and the story lines are very weak. Basically the game can be broken down in these steps: Move, fight or stop, find new place, move, fight or stop, upgrade weapons/abilities. There is not very much to do outside of these steps. In summary, a pretty disappointing game. With all the great games that SquareSoft has produced over the years, I guess they are allowed a mistake every so often. I believe that Unlimited Saga is one of them.	-1
Square dropped the ball with this title.  A waste of time on so many, many levels.  An uninspired journey into boredom. The combat system is... not bad.  Interesting.  Different, yes. If the gameplay were even remotely interesting, the combat system would push this into the highest echelon of rpg's. Thing is, the gameplay is *horrible*.  Boring, boring, boring.  There's no animations worth dealing with, everything is 2 dimensional flat cutout images in a pseudo 3-dimensional world.  Exploration is boring.  Interaction is boring.  Everything, in fact, aside from the battle system is... boring. The battle/combat system alone isn't enough to save this game.  Terrible.  Don't waste your time or your money.	-1
Uh, I can't believe the ever popular Squaresoft, the makers of the world loved Final Fantasy series, made a huge dud. I'm probably one of the most diehard RPG fans out there, but Unlimited Saga? This game is a disgrace! I ordered it off amazon and thankfully it did not ship properly. So I played it at my friends house.   I would first like to point out the graphics. The anime style animation is a good idea, but not here. As soon as you start up the game you will have a hard time looking at it. The graphics are all cartoon!   Moving around is another problem. You don't move! You point in what direction you want to go, and the screen changes. To me that is a whole chunk of RPG that is gone. And to move around in towns, you press X on the house you want to enter and your there.   The battles. Oh geez the battles. Interesting yet boring. You can choose up to 7 attacks to use on one turn using all your characters. You can also pick a small number of abilities. Then you are done and this spinning reel thing shows up. You stop it and attack, either kicking, punching or throwing.......thats about it. Oh, and the enemy attacks!   Next is sound. Thsi category isn't that bad. The sounds and music are wonderful. The music being very original and colorful. The voice acting is very poorly done however. There might be 3 characters on the screen and suddenly a voice pops up. You can't really tell who it is, mostly because its a cartoon and their lips don't move.   I'm always bummed to see very bad RPG's. They are a waste of money, and you don't really have fun with them. Unlimited Saga could have been great. Spice up the graphics, add a new battle system, and hire the FFX voice people and this game is golden. Sorry Square, but you've built a boat with no paddle.   Take my word for it and don't buy this game. Its not like Square to make a RPG like this. I'm just hoping Square will split up with Enix, so they make something worth buying. Don't buy this, its not worth the $... But if you happen to buy it, the only thing worth seeing is the preview for FFX-2!	-1
...and in fact, I don't think it is for anyone. For those of you who have played games from the Saga series (Saga Frontier, Saga Frontier 2, etc.), and DIDN'T enjoy the experience, well, you should stay far away from this! However, even those of you who did like those games will probably want to steer clear of this as well. I understand those of you who want to like this game since you sunk fifty bucks into it. I don't blame you; I was right with you. However, I feel rather duped. You see, I purchased this game at a certain electronics store which shall remain nameless. I received about a hundred emails from Square/Enix hyping this game, and indeed, the art of the game box did not suggest static gameplay and water colors. Furthermore, the store would not allow me to look at the instruction book (which is a better indicator of what the game will be like). In the end, a game which was hyped like FF and made to look like FF turns out to play like a very difficult version of Monopoly. In all honesty, this game [stinks]. And the music? Well, if I wanted beautiful classical music, I could purchase Mozart at about a fifth of the price. Shame on you, Square! But don't blame this on Enix. Yeah, Grandia X wasn't so good, but Grandia was OK, and Dragon Warrior is still spectacular.	-1
I know this is Xbox rather than Xbox 360 game  But I still bought it because I thought it is a great game so Microsoft would offer the update version so I can play in my Xbox 360, you know that right? Lots of games can be player in 360 even if they are just Xbox  I was wrong...	-1
To put it simple:  this is five star action/horror game that is drastically degraded by the worst camera system I have ever seen in my life.  The camera systems should never be the most challenging part in a game. lol.  I died more times from the silly camera than anything else.  If you believe you can get over the flawed camera system in the game, this game is for you.  I highly suggest watching some videos on youtube of gameplay so you get an idea what the camera system is like.  I seriously almost stopped playing the game due to the frustration, but I'm a pretty hardcore gamer.  So I sucked it up and fought my way to the end.  In conclusion, if you are easily frustrated by terrible camera systems this game is not for you, but if you love for action/horror, space, or dinosaurs is greater than your hatred for bad camera systems this game is for you.	-1
well this game is pretty decent i mean its dino crisis in space with jetpacks n vanquish like stuff there is a few things i hated about it though mainly that the health is so random its like even on easy mode you get hit once half of your health is gone now you can get upgrades to your health but your only gonna get a chance to purchase that upgrade 1 time as everytime you buy health packs you end up having to use them over n over again and then having to buy more health packs you can probly already hear the patern going on here the gameplay is great but the story health system and map arint all that good storywise it has nothing at all to do with dino crisis 1 or 2 they basicaly took the cheap way out n skiped a bunch of years and for some strange reason slaped the number 3 on the cover the map is like if you took metorid primes map n half a**ed it the health system i pretty much described it just seems so lazy because even with health upgrades you still end up feeling just as weak as you did before you upgraded your health would i say buy this game no unless you find it for under 10 dollars then yes	-1
Something bad happened during playtesting for this title. To be precise, it seems like nobody was playtesting it.  A 3rd person camera flicks maddeningly from one bad location to another, constantly leaving your enemies off-camera, making dodging and aiming (not to mention *crate jumping puzzles!*) a complete and utter joke. No surprise the original Dino Crisis development team had nothing to do with this visually beautiful yet disastrous title (Yes, the spaceship is beautiful).  To say the gameplay is bad would be doing a disservice: it just doesn't WORK.  A big WT_? for Capcom on this unfinished bow-wow.	-1
Not my type of game. To arcade-y	-1
I heard good reviews about this game and decided to buy it.  At first I thought it was pretty fun, but after the third boss or so, I became tired of it.  I don't know what it was that finally made me realized that this game sucks, but it did it well.  Here is what I think it might have been:  -The fighting (became trite)  -Special effects (weren't good)  -Story line (cliched)  -Voices (horrendously inane)  -Graphics (nice, but the comic-book drawings were kind of dumb)  Methinks that what I hate about the game is excatly what people love about it.  I lost the game so I didn't try finishing it, which doesn't really bother me.  I suggest renting the game before buying.  That will save you money--or it would have for me anyway.	-1
Average port of a PS2 game, this one was dead before it hit the shelf.  Just like True Crime: Streets of LA came out at the same time as the vastly superior Grand Theft Auto made the jump to Xbox, Tenchu shows up practically the same day as Ninja Gaiden.  NG has better controls, more addictive game-play, and graphics that make Tenchu look like a Playstation One game. Tenchu's been out less than a month and already they're discounting the price, but don't waste your money.  It's like kissing your sister.  Spend the extra money and get one of the best games ever seen on Xbox - and this isn't it. (No I don't work for Team Ninja!)	-1
This game is a disgrace to the mega man name. It's horrible plain and simple. Ugly, too hard, stupid idea overall. Forget this and get X7 for PS2. much better.	-1
Being a huge fan of the first 3 original Mega Man's, and having played through just about every version made except for the Gameboy versions, I was really excited to play a Mega Man on Gamecube. But there are so many things wrong with this game. The graphics are cel shaded and look weak. There is minimal background scrolling, very little in general going on in the background, and all the levels are very similar looking.  Graphics on the SuperNES were better than this. I know they were going for a cartoony look but it's just too flat looking,  lacking style, looking more like colorforms. If you want an example of how it should have looked check out the Mega Man game that was in the arcades in the 90's. The music is also horrible. Mega Man 2 and others in the series are known for some of the best game music ever made, and given the power of DVD techology you'd think it would have a great soundtrack, but it ends up just sounding really generic and tinny. The game also breaks away from previous games as you are given chips at the start of each level. The computer choses 5 chips to give you and you can either accept them or send them back and play the stage without any chips (chips being your 'special' item weapon). Also refilling your meters works entirely different than previous Mega Man games. You blaster starts out extremely weak sometimes taking 8 shots to kill your standard  basic enemy. Your character is also much larger now which is good but because you can't jump as high and because your slide is often uncontrollable it's very hard to maneuver around enemy bullets. I could go on forever how disappointing this game is but I think I've gone on enough. I'm sure there will be people who like this game, it's playable, but if you are like me and more into the 'old-school' style of mega man games you will only find this title to be mediocre.	-1
The only good purpose this game served was allowing me to adjust to the PS2 controller. It's slow and repetitive and frankly extremely boring. Its only resemblance to any other Resident Evil game are the zombies, herbs and weapon storage. Everything else is just kind of lame. I'd say buy this if you just want to shoot stuff with the sensation of being in recovery from a coma. hahaa  Sorry. It's just really bad.  Like many, I wish Capcom would do a good remake of Resident Evil 2 instead of wasting resources on crap like this. A RE2 remake would be a cool gaming experience.  Don't waste your money on this one. You are likely to be disappointed.	-1
crap crap crap crap crap. Storyline sucked, nothing compared to other RE storylines. When will Capcom continue with the Jill, Chris, Claire storylines? The only fun part of this game is on the ship shooting zombies in the head. But I never found a compatable gun to be used with this game.	-1
man if you buy this wack game something is wrong with you mentally. i want to write capcom a hate letter for this game. i don't know what they were thinking makin this crap!	-1
THis game makes you think it will be good over the first few minutes of cool cut scenes and cool action.  THen you move inside the game ... for the rest of the game it seems.  THen the game loses all coolness.  Somewhere around the fifth room, you realize you have to do the exact same thing in every room.  Bottom Line:  Is it fun?  If you like bad action and the same thing over and over again.  Will you keep it?  No way.  Is it for kids?  You blow up robots againa and again and again and again and again and ... you get the idea.  If that is bad for kids well there you go.	-1
It's brilliant game and fabulous ideas were it's only action fight game similar to devil may cry but bad graphics and design though besides no story line at all. The more you push buttons the more you will be winning. once you unlock the 14 levels, the game becomes invincible were all your power you got by playing will be nothing and it's just like starting all over were the new enemies really makes a HUGE damage and it's impossible to beat. In this point it becomes boring and you'll be starting to find cheats. I used to LOVE this game and I've played it long time back but didn't reach this point but now I felt it was a complete waste of time. See it on youtube and find out if it worth buying it. To me no.	-1
My title for this review basically states on how I feel about this game. If I can beat a game within 24 hours and not really remember the story  then I'm definately not giving it a good review. The game play is too much like Devil May Cry. I must say the cutscenes were good, but that's it. I bought this the day it came out and also beat it the day it came out. If you like repeative, easy games than this is for you.	-1
Wow. is there anyhting good about this game? The fighting is awful, so is the plot, graphics, sound, voice acting, duration. Tries to be cool like Devil may cry, but makes the game all  the more stupid. The worst level design!	-1
First let me start off by saying I absolutely love the Aliens vs. Predator franchise.  Its probably one of the best ideas that had ever been conceived.  Pitting two of the most popular movie monsters of all time against one another in a fight to the death...what could be more fun?  Well, unlike the other Aliens vs. Predator games, AvP:Extinction breaks the First Person Shooter criteria and comes in with a Real-Time Strategy game.  Its a nice attempt, but ultimately flawed. The graphics in the game are sub-par...as far as a strategy game goes they're decent, but just very average...clearly nowhere near the caliber of Warcraft III or Command and Conquer: Generals.  However, examining the creatures up close yields further distortions in graphics.  Some of the aliens look ridiculous, and the Predators look just plain silly.  The design is very cartoonish, just like Aliens vs. Predator 2 for the PC, which many people complained about.  The environments are also very drab and dull...nothing really stands out.  Some of the jungle environments are nice, but most of the environments, such as interior settings and caves, are just lifeless and boring. The game itself is very simplistic.  While creating endless droves of Aliens is alot of fun, the whole game just lacks substance.  Aliens use the Queen to lay eggs, and drag back hosts that they killed (or more likely, just invaded and nearly wiped out your colony the moment the mission started).  The Queen is basically the epicenter of the hive...you purchase all upgrades by selecting her, and using 'currency' earned by killing your enemies, you can upgrade your aliens.  The basic Alien species are there: the warrior, the drone, the dog alien from Alien 3, the praetorian introduced in the AvP games, and new Aliens called 'Ravagers', which are huge, monstrous aliens with blades for hands that rend and maim opponents.  The 'Carrier' is a large Alien that allows facehuggers to attach to its dorsal spines and leap out at enemies as you go.  Nice ideas, though the creatures themselves look uninspired.  All the aliens have unique abilities, and playing as them was an overall fine experience, but the game is just not executed well. As for Predators, you are very limited in forces, which is understandable considering how powerful they are.  The only building they have is the 'Shrine', where upgrades can be purchased and new Predators summoned.  All the Predators have unique abilities and weapons, though some of them look uterly ridiculous...one Predator has a scythe, and it just doesn't go well with the whole Predator look.  Cloaking is utterly useless, since it seems that everyone and everything can see you regardless.  Predators earn curency by killing, as well as taking trophy skulls of their enemies. Marines are simple enough to use, though difficult to play.  The 'CommTech' is used to purchase upgrades and summon more units from the dropship.  If the commtech is killed, you're out of luck.  Some of the humans are immensely powerful, which throws the balance of the game off alot.  The marines don't have any structures of any kind, just one landing beacon where the drop ship lands.  Marines earn currency by fixing 'Atmos' which generate steady income.  They must be defended, since Aliens and Predators will try to destroy these every chance they get. The game is unbeleivably difficult...it should be the Aliens that come in countless swarms...not marines and Predators.  The final Alien mission is infuriating...the moment the mission starts out, you are attacked by all three sides (Marine, Predator, Mutant Aliens) and they don't attack each other...they attack you.  Some of the earliest Predator missions open up right into the middle of a fire fight...the Predators should be able to decimate marines but the endless swarm of marines and their incredibly strong fire power are too much.  The game can end before you even get out of the starting area.  As for marines...forget it.  Aliens and Predators swarm you so much you won't even know whats going on half the time. Overall, the game's biggest fault is that it was designed narrowly...with the consoles in mind.  All the races, while characteristically different, are fundamentally the same.  None have any structures, other than the main population center (Queen, Shrine, Landing Beacon).  The game is somewhat unbalanced, with some units just being far too powerful.  The idea of Alien procreation is good and is probably one of the best aspects of the game, but this game is just far too basic of an RTS. Perhaps its biggest fault is the complete lack of Multi-player and custom missions.  Once you beat the game, that's it.  You're done.  There is nothing else to do, unless you want to try for a 'medal' by fulfilling all mission requirements in a certain amount of time.  The game is virtually devoid of extras, and there are no ending cinematics...when you beat a campaign...that's it...you're just done.  You won.  Nothing else.  There is no downloadable content or anything else...this is strictly a one-player strategy game that, once beaten, has absolutely nothing else going for it.  This was a decent attempt to expand the Aliens vs. Predator franchise into a new game genre...but it fails.  Perhaps they should've paid more attention to existing strategy games...its utter lack of options and extras throws this game back almost ten years...compared to other RTS games, it is basic and completely mediocre.  The game was fun, but it took only about 2 or 3 days to complete, and playing it anymore beyond that became pointless, because there was nothing else to do. This just further proves that RTS games belong on PCs, not consoles.  Had this game been released for the PC, with multi-player options, extra content, and a better game engine overall, then this would have been a winner.  As it stands, it was a decent but failed attempt.	-1
The three campaigns in this real-time strategy game are set on similar-looking maps, the objectives (even the discover-able optional ones) are predictable, the actual strategies are basic, the AI mediocre (pathfinding in particular is a significant issue), there's very little in the way of presentational touches (not even cinematics at the end of each campaign) and the play, while outwardly difficult at medium level, becomes far easier once you discover the upgrades ... at which time your over-powered crew can take on pretty much all comers. I enjoyed the Alien campaign best -- there's something corruptly fun about running a hive -- but the elaborate alien-creation process aside, it's cut from the same cheap cloth as its Marine and Predator counterparts. Try Goblin Commander instead. :)	-1
It doesn't work on the 360... This makes me kind of mad. I wish that it would work but unfortunately it won't. I have the Original Deus Ex for the PC. I thought that perhaps it may work with5 the 360. Nope, it ain't gonna! :/	-1
all im going to say is that they should of left deus ex alone.the first was the BEST DAMN GAVE EVER in my opinion notone can ouspeak me about that but this game lacks..ammo and biomods	-1
Hype! I love hype. The kind of hype that says this game is going to have revolutionary graphics and gameplay. Unfortunitly most things that are hyped don't live up to it as is the case with Deus Ex 2. Let's start with the highly touted graphics: the textures in this game suck, they're muddy, dirty, and washed out, frankly they look as though they belong on the PS2 I HATE THEM! It is true the game does have good lighting effects but they do not over shadow the otherwise bland and boring level disign. Also the rag doll physics are realy lame and unrealistic. Next the other over hyped portion of this game, the gameplay: it's not that f-ing original, it's not. What it is though is very linear and uninspierd. My biggest complaint in this area is my biggest overall: the shooting. This game is a first person shooter G---amnit; now I know the games creators would like to think that they crafted some sort of revolutionary RPG but that is just not the case. First and fore most this game is a FPS and shooting people is realy boring and in no way satisfying. Lastly the soposed "great story" is realy not that special, it's just recycled X-Files you are not alone shlok (did I spell that right?). Just about everybody I know admits that this game was at least somewhat disapointing, be warned.	-1
i really like the way it looked... but they spent more on the case then on the actual game! at first it was kinda fun... but since i hate a camera 30 ft away from my character.... it got VERY annoying, so i never finnished the game... i'm not saying it's a bad game... i'm just saying that if you don't like a camera 30 feet in the freakin air... you REALLY shouldn't get this game... but for those of you that don't mind that, you would really like this game... it's kinda addicting.... if you can look past the 10 million glitches!  if your like me... i would suggest getting a different game... like devil may cry, titan quest, the witcher, oblivion, timeshift, or if your more into games like this... you probably would like dawn of magic or spellforce.	-1
What a frustration.  There must be a patch out there I can't find.  This game suffers from such slow game play it is a wonder it was ever released.  Did any of the developers actually bother to play there finished product?  Maybe so but it was too late to do anything about it by then.  You will spend 90% of your time waiting in combat for your turn.  Good luck with it.  Hail Flavius	-1
You know that saying "the whole is greater than the some of its parts"? Well, I feel the oposite is true with this game. It certainly looks very good. It has a very good turn-based fighting system that is easy to use. Stat building and leveling up is handled well. The problem is that these individual elements do not add up to an enjoyable game. It feels rather empty, and due to many bugs (several of which crash the game), I found myself eager to "get it over with" so I could play something else.  It lacks any meaningful plot and is basically a series of somewhat redundant battles. I got the feeling it was a great starting point for a really good game, but it never really went anywhere. On to KotOR!	-1
i bought the game awhile back but for me didn't have a problem getting it to work.  the control interface couldve been alot better as well as the many many bugs the game has.  i uninstalled it and quit playing it because of the bugs as well as didn't agree with the fact you had to go and download all the patches for it as well and it doesnt mean the patches fixed anything.  i am a hardcore gamer and i do have patience but with this game it was worn thin.  the graphics are ok there are many things to do in the game but the overall bug problem as well as downloading all the patches hurts the game.  if you have patience and you have time on your hands to tinker around then all means buy the game.	-1
Over all the game play of this game is not bad.  The 3.5 rules are well implemented.  The story line is pretty good, and the game is a nice mix of hack and slash and dialogue based quests. The lack of character customization when it came to the appearance of the characters bothered me a little bit, but certainly didn't ruin the game for me.  I certainly would have prefered a bit better graphics, but again the graphics weren't terrible either.  This game is a real nice introduction to classic D&D, but those all ready familiar with the game may be wishing for some more areas to explore (the game is kinda limited in this respect).  I have a feeling that while I've never played the original Temple of Elemental Evil that it was meant more as an introductory adventure anyhow, this game certainly felt that way.  I also really didn't like that your only option for character building was the dice rolling method, when most games now a days are implementing the point buy system for stats as an option, and I much prefer that option.  The real downfall of this game is it was released with a major flaw.  On some systems it runs fine, while on others it is completely unplayable without a patch.  It is simply ridiculous that a game will not even play on some computers that meet the system requirements.  When I buy a product, I at least expect it to have been well enough made to run on a machine that meets all the requirments, without having to download a patch.  I expect a better quality product than that.	-1
Ill get straight to the point: Stay away from this game.  I have played The Icewwind Dale series, Baldurs gate 1 & 2 and the excellent Planescape: Torment several time over. They are all great games.  When it was announced a PC version of Temple of Elemental Evil, I was very excited. I remember the the thrill playing, and then DMing the PnP version of the game some 15 years ago.  And THIS is what they come up with?!? Crap!  1. Bugs. After installing the three official patches the game is still bug-ridden: clicking on a character brings up the inv. of another, spells don't work, desktop crashing, numerous clipping issues (which is very rare in 2D game), an interface that seem to do the exact opposite of what you want it to do. etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.  2. Tedious. The D & D 3.5 rules does not translate into a computer game. At all. It is that simple. In the Baldurs gate series the game play was fast, intuitive. exciting. In ToEE its a big yawn.  The Homlet quest are, with two exceptions, dumb, boring and errand boyish: Tell X to bring me a turnip, get a hammer for the blacksmith, tell X that Y really likes her, play cards with some bum at the inn. You get the idea.....  Combatwise it is none the better: I spent som 50 minutes chooping up 2 frogs just to get inside the Moathouse.  Had the 50 minutes been exciting I wouldnt mind, but its just a series of going through motions, linear clicking on options on each characters unwieldy radial menu.  Accurate representation of combat? Maybe.  Fun (which, in the end is why we all play computer games)? If your idea of fun is sticking needles in your eyes, this game is a blast.  3. Visuals & audio  The voice acting is in the top 3 worst games ever. A good example is the character Elmo whom you meet at the begining. After the encounter, I was left wondering if this was a joke on the gamers by the makers of this game.  The visuals are an anachronism. Great in 1998. Maybe. Today you get better visuals on high-end mobile phones.  4. The bugs, incredibly crummy gameplay, DD 3,5 rules, bad visuals and audio coupled with a thoroughly uninspired story makes this a game you should steer clear of.  Advice: If you haven't played the Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale serie yet: get those.  If you have: play them again  Anything but ToEE, even if it is in the bargain bin for 2 bucks.	-1
I'm about half way through this game and it honestly feels like a 4.5 star game, except it won't stop crashing!  I played the original NWN without a problem (skipped SoU) as well as dozens of other games, all with my existing hardware, software and configuration.  I'm running all mainstream stuff: Win2k, Service Pack 4 with all relevant hotfixes (so...5,000). ATI Radeon 9700 Pro - great card. AMD 2200+ on an Abit mobo, 512 ram. Patch 1.62, installed on March 12th 2004. So basically what happens is the game either locks up during a save and after about 30 seconds crashes to desktop corrupting that save file in the process, or the system reboots.  Neither scenario gives any warning and if I play for 3-4 hours then I'm about guarunteed to have at least one of each crash. So the game is great.  Graphics are nice, sound is fine, nothing special.  The battles are a lot of fun and I really enjoy watching my dwarven fighter charge a drow cleric amid fire and ice storms.  The power given to you is awesome as your guy gets around level 20, and since the game starts off with you generating a character and leveling it up to level 15 you can customize the bejeezus out of it.  The game bogs down a little sometimes, which annoys me since I greatly exceed the recommended specs, but that doesn't happen enough for it to be a problem. Summary: Buy this game if you liked NWN, it is tons of fun.  But either research your PC setup online to see if others are having problems or at least wait until patch 1.62 is no longer the latest.  I'm going to think really hard before buying Atari again. UPDATE: I updated my graphics driver to the latest catalyst driver from ATI (version 4.3 at this time) and the machine reboots seem to have stopped.  However the game still locks up about 1 time in 10-20 while saving.  I hit ctrl+alt+delete and kill the process after it freezes and I've caught the game using 210MB of memory!  The log files it says it is generating are useless, they just describe event within the game itself before it crashes. Maybe Atari is one of those things to avoid now so as to keep our fond childhood memories....	-1
I've read many of the reviews of this game and notice that everyone keeps saying it's "buggy".  Well, I wouldn't know about that, as I can't get through the tutorial without getting a massive headache.  Why, you ask?  The font is too small.  I do not know why, but this seems to be a problem that not many reviewers have picked up on.  Even in 800 X 600 mode on a 19 inch monitor, you have to sit about one foot away from the screen to read the text clearly. This does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a trend toward using barely ledgible font in many new PC games.  I must defer any other commentary about the game's "bugginess" to the other reviewers.  I salute them for being able to play it even for a little while.  Nevertheless, I think that a word of warning should go out to any gamers who don't like the idea of duct-taping their heads to the monitor.	-1
I played PnP D&D for years.  If I wanted an exact copy of it on PC, I'd still be ticked off about wasting $50 on this pice of garbage.  I wanted a bit more "pc game" out of this pc game.  This game delivers when it comes to it's adherence to the 3.5 rule set and formulae, but as a video game it is a piece of junk.  D&D fans would be better served by investing in the latest books and playing the traditional way. The graphics are god-awful.  The background environment in the entire game is 2D.  This game may have been on par in 1999 with the then current level of graphic complexity, but it came out at the end of 2002, when Neverwinter Nights had already been on the market for some time.  NWN graphics were and are far superior.  In fact, Baldur's Gate II graphics are/were far superior. I dare say I believe BG ONE had better graphics. Buggy?  This game put a whole new meaning to the term "buggy".  It crashes.  And it crashes.  And it crashes some more.  Despite the garbage gui, it still slows to a grinding halt even on my up-to-date pc. Even with the patch I have yet to be able to complete this game. Support?  You won't get any from the producers of this crap-fest.  In the words of the head honcho, "...I like to put the [completed games] behind me and move on to the next project..."  I've been keeping track.  A second patch, which is supposed to fix the problems the first patch either missed, or created anew, has been promised for over a year.  Release dates are promised, then the developers just disappear for a time.  No, I don't ever suspect I'll ever be ableto finish this game. Linear.  Probably the most linear RPG created in the past 6 years.  You get no opportunity to explore the world...mainly because it doesn't exist.  Despite the games strict adherance to the D&D 3.5 rules, it doesn't even give you remotely the same experience as TOEE gave when played on PnP.  The side quests are a joke.  They are the worst example of fedex I can think of.  "Go tell him I said OK  I'll wait here."  "He said OK." "Tell him I said I like OK, I'll wait here."  "He said he likes OK."  "Good.  Tell him to come here.  I'll wait here"  etc, etc, etc.  This is just an example of the hours upon hours of useless "missions" you'll perform.  And you have to perform them as they unlock certain key mission areas.  So in a sense, they aren't side quests at all.  You are STUCK doing them in the exact fashion and order.....linear.  No, you cannot wander off into the woods to explore. If you like D&D...buy the 3.5 rule books and go play the old fashion way.  You'll have a much better time.  If you want a D&D based game for your pc, go get Neverwinter Nights and both expansions.  Besides, theres thousands of mods out there to keep it interesting for years.  NWN has the potential to stay around for as long as Elder Scrolls has.	-1
Ok. I'm one of these guys who is basing his review on the demo. The demo I played is no way to get people to buy a game. My characters were killed so fast, it was pathetic. Every time I rested to heal (even for 1 day) I would be surrounded by rats, thugs, or snakes. There was no way to heal my guys because I was taking hits from enemies every time I tried to heal someone. Also, just about every attack I made was a miss while the enemies nailed me almost every time. Even spells were misses on a regular basis. This is definately not recommended. I played Heroes on X-box and had way more fun.	-1
I loved this module when it came out.  I saw this and I was thrilled.  Finally, they had done what I wanted done for so long.  I bought it and installed it.  Started off very fun.  Then I played longer.  I can not get any of my quest outside of Hommlet to update.  I have been in contact with Atari and tried their suggestions and they don't work.  This game is just not worth the money.  I had to stop playing because not being able to complete the quests makes the game difficult and not very fun.  Hopefully they will try to correct all the problems they have.	-1
Bought this game and returned it the next day.  What kind of game doesn't start after you install it?  I have a new system and have never had this problem with any other game.  Save yourself some grief and buy something else.	-1
The game looks good and has a very nice user interface system for issuing commands to characters.  BUT THE PROGRAM IS FULL OF BUGS AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THIS CONDITION.  Don't buy this game until they do something about the bugs. - monsters spawn where you can't reach them and you can't exit that part of the dungeon while there are active monsters.  You have to exit the game to actually leave the dungeon and if you saved while trapped ... then you'll have to start over again.  Very frustrating. - Ironman mode menu system doesn't work	-1
As a huge fan of Baldur's Gate II, I was expecting a lot more from this game. The party system is not at all like BGII. There are no romances or banter to be found, unless you engage in the online play. That, in and of itself, was the most dissapointing aspect of this game. The rest of the game was ok. The graphics are pretty nice, a little cumbersome at times. The plot is fairly interesting, perhaps a bit too easy for some. The game also offers a starting level to help train the new player on the various controls and console. Overall though, it just got really boring without the ingame banter/romances/mods that BGII had.	-1
The first Dark Alliance had far better graphics and more interesting monsters.  Plus, while the story was corny and cliched, there still was a story.  This has pretty much no story at all, the monsters are lame, the graphics are forgettable, the settings are dumb (or inappropriate for D&D), and the gameplay monotonous.  The ending has you going through the very same Onyx Tower as in the first (although the story explains this well), and the final battle is largely identical to that in DA I.  One oft-heard criticism of Dark Alliance I was that it was too short:  if you sat down in the morning with it, you could definitely get through the game in one day, by afternoon or early evening.  I think the gamemakers took that criticism to heart when they made this sequel:  no getting through this one in a day.  Unfortunately, that was accomplished not by adding more mazes and monsters but simply by having each level by interminably long and repetitive.  Bigger mazes are not necessarily better, especially if it's just the same ol' stuff over and over again.  Whenever I get in the mood to play hack-and-slash, I always play through the first one.  Whenever I continue on to the second one, I always regret it.	-1
This is basically a hack-n-slash game.  You basically wind up figuring out the most effective attacks, then ignore beefing up any other special abilities.  Some of the environments look pretty cool, though I realize I don't like games that show everything in top-down 3/4 perspective anymore (I think that's what they call it).  But there is a lot of action.  So if you like killing monsters for hours on end (I found it to be a longer game than one person pointed out.  Longer than 12 hours IMO) you'll like this game.  I think for this kind of game, Gauntlet Dark Legacy is WAY more fun.  It's probably the same game length, definitely better graphics/perspective, more interesting level puzzles (Baldur's Gate has none really), and focuses on the abilities you need to kill monsters most effectively.  There are no unnecessary abilities in that game.  You can also play with a total of 4 people.  BG is only for 1-2 players.	-1
I downloaded the seven day free trial for this game and it made me put in my credit number. That's the most idiotic thing ever and the very first time that I saw a free downloadable trial of a game that made you put in your credit card. They probably make you put it in so they won't tell you when your seven day trial is over but instead, charge you after it's over without notice. I'm giving it one star just for this reason, it shows that the company is greedy and like to give a lot of BS.	-1
Played early beta, was fun. Then they opened it up, too many people. Too much lag. This game STILL (1/19) sucks, save your money for World Of Warcraft.	-1
Why did I let myself spend $50 on this game?! ARGH! I've been playing for 2 weeks now, and there is downtime aplenty, bugs, no maps, and item disappearance galore. They even have an item replacement policy on the homepage it happens so much. I am so completely disgusted with this game. Star Wars Galaxies had problems, but there was something to *DO*. There are ACRES of non-content, and server lag will have your characters and MOBS rubber-banding all over.. And I have a fast cable modem. Further, when trying to engage MOBs, you have to chase the thing for 15 feet before you finally attack, usually in the middle of a camp. You never have any idea where you are, there are no maps, no locate "/loc" coordinate system, no "/where" to find NPC's.. I HATE THIS GAME! GIMME MY MONEY BACK!!	-1
I've been playing the game for the last month and just past my subscription renewal point without cancelling, but I don't think I'll go that much further with this game.  Horizons does many things right, but has a few things wrong with it that really ruin the game experience. Graphics look good, but not always smooth.  A high end system is required to run this game and you'll be tweaking the settings even with the best of systems.  As the biggest memory hog game ever created, it will chew through 1 gig of memory real quick and a Radeon 9800 pro 256 becomes "not enough".  There's a good side of this though:  Even at low settings, it looks great and you will spend time just staring at the landscape and stars.  Like EQ, most lag occurs in high populated areas such as towns and cites probley a result of bad net code just as much as graphics. Horizons has the best sound and music I've heard in a game.  They really spent some time and did it right and the music will haunt you once you hear it.  It changes as you enter different environments and really enhances your experience.  Game designers can learn alot from Horizons when it comes to the music. The main challenge facing Horizons is it's content.  There's barely any at all.  The only real content you'll find in horizons is what you create yourself.  Quests usually involve collecting 10 things of "this" or kill 30 of "that" and are just plain stupid. Many quests will have you running here or running there being a mad messenger of sorts.  While this follows what's been seen in other MMORPG's, Horizons fails in it's attempt as there's no real sense of danger in it.  Dying in Horizons gives you a "death penalty ticket".  You don't have to get back to your corpse, no loss of XP, you just get a ticket that reduces your effectiveness for eight hours.  I have never felt this effect and can't tell the difference.  There is no fear of death in Horizons, no real penalty.  Go ahead and kill that big golumn, it doesn't matter if you die, you can just try again.  There's no real sense of adventure here. Crafting becomes tedious.  The placement of resources in the game at higher tiers is designed to get you running back and forth for hours between gathering and processing of them.  While many things are done right with the way Horizons does crafting, it becomes a chore.  Spending four hours mining ore and creating things raising your level, then rinse and repeat. Where's my monsters?  While other games had all sorts of monsters everywhere you run, Horizons has hardly any. They usually group in area's and can easily be avoided.  Even if they do come at you you can easily outrun them.  For fun I aggro'd an entire army of undead and tried to train them into town.  In other games this would be a horrible thing, but in Horizons they just head directly back and give up at a certain point - not going after anyone else they pass along the way.  Again, there's no sense of danger here. Unlike others, the game bugs are providing me with an endless source of entertainment.  I don't get upset like so many others.  It adds a challenge when the game crashes right in the middle of taking on two higher level creatures, or right when my group needs me the most.  It adds a real world element to the game and sense of urgency as I scramble to get back in through the web portal they've created.  To me, this is a game feature that should be explored further and could really invoke some strong gameplayer emotions.  The Devs are scrambling. I have hopes for this game.  There are many things to like about it and it seems a shame that it was rushed out the door so quickly.  They can fix it.  I think it will be a better game in a couple of months.  With the other MMORPG's coming (World of Warcraft/EQ II) it had better be.	-1
I'd never heard anything about the Warhammer 40,000 universe before playing this game.  It looks like people who know the universe enjoy it much more.  As far as compared to other first-person shooters, this is pretty disappointing.  Reading the game features made it sound pretty cool, but the developers just missed opportunites.  You can carry one gun in each hand... apparently all the people in the year 40k have two right hands ;)  Other than launching rather than tossing gernades and amount of ammo, I couldn't figure out the difference between the two guns you get...other than looks.  The shoot exactly the same.  You also just run up and fire point-blank range at other players and whoever lands the first 10 or so hits wins.  I can't believe that a universe that has been developed as long as WH40K appears to have been could be so lifeless and stale... nothing interesting I haven't seen in other FPSers.  Maybe knowing the back-story would make it more interesting.  The graphics are pretty nice- so I give it 2 stars for that, but if you are an FPS fan and not a WH40K fan, you might want to skip this one.	-1
Somehow I was able to play this game to the end.  The game had a habit of freezing up on me.  It was pretty cool but the story was weak, however, there's a twist at the end which leaves possibility for a sequel.  After a while I felt like I was just going through the motions of going from one level to the next.  It's good to play only once if the bugs don't get you first.	-1
Here is a small list of what is wrong with this game and what fun awaits you in you play it: The graphics are out of date. The textures repeat so often it feels like the game is set in one location. The mood of the game is as much fun as a empty warehouse. The story is a mess and feels like a 14 year old watched Total Recall a few too many times. The voice acting will make you giggle and roll your eyes. Your name in the game is "Chaser"?! The wepons are boring and we have seen them all before. The in game movies are boring and too long at times. The level design is crap with death waiting at every ladder, hole or tiny little crevass. Many times you will get stuck becuase you have not triggered the next part of the map. Maps are long, boring and as lifeless. Eneimes all say the same things, in the same voice, on every level. You face the same enimies on almost evey map. Bad guys can pop into any level wherever it suited the game designers. Perhaps the wost part is the game is no fun at all.  Clearing a map has no sense of satifaction.  After 5 maps you could care less about the story as you trudge thru this boring game. If your smart, avoid this game.  Unless your a 14 year old fan of Total Recall.	-1
I found this particular brand and make of joystick to be the worst I've ever had.  It starts having centering problems within the first month so a dead zone has to be created.  And it continue to get worse from that point on until it flat fails.	-1
I bought this back in may 2017. I use it strictly for Star Wars Galaxy. This stick is fantastic for the JTL content.  The buttons are easily mapped and stick is stiff, but responsive. Perfect for PVP.  My gripe though seems to be a common one after doing a lot of homework on way my ship was constantly rolling to the left. The twist function within the joystick doesn't seem to be durable as I've had to set up a return order.  Now this is where I really am annoyed.  Logitech, one of the largest accessory companies has been absolutely horrible about the claim I filed.  I've been waiting days on end for a response and was forced to go go back to amazon.com to see what they'd suggest.  To my surprise, Amazon went and ok'd the return due to the manufacturer not being supportive.  Big Kudos to Amazon.  Overall: maybe I just got a bad joy..  I really like the stick during the first few months of ownership. It's comfortable and ofters a wide variety of buttons that's convenient for your casual flyer. I've seen other sticks with separate throttle and buttons on this, but to be honest, i'm a lazy pilot and I don't want to have to figure out 2 controls vs having everything on one package. If something could be done about the poor durability for the twist function,  I think you would have a product, but like I said, maybe it's just a defective joy.  UPDATE:  11/14 -- Upon ordering a replacement, that was fulfilled by Amazon.com for a new replacement. I received a clunky oversized box and the joystick in a bag. No packing materials like popcorn. Needless to say, being livid is an understatement.  It's busted too.  Amazon has issued a refund for #2.  Honestly...  Don't buy this.  No joystick is worth this much headache.	-1
Does not work as advertised.  I would not purchase again.	-1
worked on 1 system not that well	-1
had to sent back no disk	-1
I was actually looking forward to playing Terminator 3 on the PS2 and had high expectations for it, just like I had had with the Enter the Matrix game earlier this year.  And once again, just like with Enter the Matrix, I should have known better.  Everything about this game is bad, real bad.  The entire game just seems so poorly pieced together that it comes off as a hack job.  The graphics are bland with chunky polygons, the controls are clunky, the missions are boring and repetitive, and the game all together is too easy.  There are extras to unlock such as CG segments and actual scenes deleted from the film, but nothing here is worth laying down hard earned money for whether it's purchase or a rental.  The mediocre Terminator: Dawn of Fate was better than this dud.  All in all, Terminator fans should stay far away from this game, which is yet another licensed dud.	-1
Basically, this game's not worth anyone's money. I bought this game thinking it would be pretty good, but boy was I surprised. This game has ok graphics, terrible gameplay, and no story at all. I wish this game was never made because it made Atari look stupid. The only upside about it is that it has a Terminator liscence, which is always cool(except this time).	-1
This game is dark, dank, gritty and boring! The controls are extremely hard to master because you have to use both of the analog sticks to walk and turn and aim all at the same time. The graphics are cool and so are the actor's voice overs, but that's the only redeeming uality about this lame-fest! Don't buy this waste of $50, wait for the next one to come out, that game is going to rock!	-1
I don't know much about Magic the Gathering, but I like strategy games so I gave this one a try.  For a video game based on a card game, Magic is pretty action packed. In fact, the game plays a lot like one on one extreme dodgeball. The action is fast and frantic. There are two opponents on seperate sides divided by a line. If you cross the line, you lose life every 3 seconds or something like that. You pick up power ups that can be used to conjure up monsters or to cast spells. The more powerups you have the more stuff you can throw at the other guy. So basically you pick up white balls off the ground and then you use their power to send monsters to hit the other guy. Unlike dodgeball, though, you could even run over to the other side to steal your opponents power ups, or better yet, join your little monsters in the beatings. I guess it's more like streetfighter/dodgeball. The game is action packed, and it's somewhat entertaining, especially when playing with friends. I wouldn't consider this a strategy or RPG, but it's easily worth its bargain bin price. With this game, you definately get what you pay for. If you're looking for a real strategy/rpg, I recommend Gladius.	-1
If you're looking for something MTG flavored, you should quite frankly look somewhere else.  This is a poorly-executed attempt at changing a deep strategy game into a fast-paced game of counters and tactics.  It fails.  Miserably so.  Tactics in this game roughly amount to whether you send your MTG-equivalent of rock, scissors or paper against your opponent's selection.  There's no more depth to it than that.  To make things even more frustrating, the game requires you mash buttons as quickly and almost indiscriminately as possible in order to match up with the computer's spellcaster.  Thus your choice of rock or scissors is largely decided by luck rather than any true strategy.  And once you figure out what an opposing spellcaster's bag of tricks contains, there's nothing more to beating him than always countering his attack and attacking his weakness- for every opponent you face is a one trick pony.  Nothing to see here folks, move along.	-1
Having never played the card game, I bought this primarily because it was X-box live capable and at $30 was a pretty good deal. In single mode you begin with a cahracter (you have no choice who you start with) and then begin a series of battles.  Each time you win you are rewarded with a new spell.  Each of these quests consists of about 15 - 20 battles until you get to the "boss" battle.  Defeating this boss gets you one of 5 colored gem on the way to completing the entire quest. As has been noted by other reviewers, the battles tend to be either so easy that you beat them on the first try, or so frustrating that you give up after hours of trying.  When games are this tough it's always a signal to me that the game play is so thin that they make it very hard in an attempt to make things seem deeper. But the more you play the quest and arcade modes, the more spells and characters you can get in order to fight on-line.  You can pick your skill lever and your cards and battle it out against friends or foe from around the country. Frankly I'm a bit disappointed in that it seems there are not many online players for this game.  I find it surprising given the popularity of the game, but as I said, the game is not very in depth with only some 70 or so odd spells and I think experienced Magic players may be turned off by this. Also, thus far there has been ZERO new content to download while a game like Rainbow Six 3 has provided 5 new maps already. It's not a horrible game but I have to guess it's just not deep enough for experience Magic fans and just not fun enough for new players.	-1
mine stopped working about 6 days after i got it and im stupid for not sending it back smh	-1
That is a bad products, no is compatible with the MICROSOFT COMBAT FLY SIMULATOR, other person that have this Joystick with a old program similar, exactly similar as MICROSOFT COMBAT FLY SIMULATOR is ok, but with this program, no run, somthing is bad, the program and the joystick-	-1
There is no point in getting a joystick that will last you 8 months before breaking. Do not buy this. I have gone through my second one and I am definitely not buying a 3rd. The z-axis calibration fails followed by everything else after a while. It is fantastic when you first get it but it WILL fail after a few months. Just avoid this altogether and get the Thrustmaster Hotas for $40 if you need something cheap. I think that is what I'll be getting, or maybe the Saitek x52 if I can afford to spend more at the time of purchase, currently waiting to see if any Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals will show up. But seriously, avoid this joystick don't waste your money	-1
Well, what can one say about this game. I guess your here wanting to know whether this game is any good or not ? Answer : By far it is a sub average game with VERY tedious gameplay and poorly exucuted story fragments and cutscenes. The whole game is a bit of a mish mash of CGI footage and actual movie footage which really makes the game feel like it is cut and pasted. The CGI is pretty good though a bit foggy looking like the beginning of Resident Evil Remake for Nintendo ( meaning there is a slight blur to it all). The movie scenes are good but just seemed un-nesccary and really didn't add anything to the game (if i wanted to see the film id get that). The controls are relatively easy and don't take much time to pick up. Probabely because you will be doing the same thing over and over again. The AI in the game respawn in certain areas and you will be contiunally shooting those damn flying machines forever thinking " im getting bored of this". The developers just throws AI at you with the occasional mission directive (like find Sarah Connors coffin)and think they have this new sensational game. No they don't !!!!!! Don't be fooled either by there campaign that they have the REAL man himself and that this makes the game better than any other. Arnold really doesn't have alot to do with this game. Basically all Arnold had to do for this game was go in a sound booth for a minute say 10 words like " excellent" " reloaded" and so forth and here we have the result. A game that really is repeative in every way and has no real distinction over other Terminators games for having the big fella involved. The environments are mostly from the future setting with black charcol skys and burnt building and out of 22 levels about 18 of these are all like this. Boring, Dull and just too similar for anyone to care. And this whole first person shooter cross bred with fist fighting ????? Yer, it works and i didn't mind the bouts with the T-X. I even get the lack of fluidity with the controls as these are machines fighting not kung-fu max payne rip offs. But still, it nuthin revoultionary or really adds a great deal for the game play. Though this was my favourite part of the game and trust me thats not saying much. I played the whole thing through even though i got bored after the first 4 levels. The whole thing is a un-insipring mess that is not the NEXT big thing in gaming nor a decent add on to the Terminator mythos. Conclusion: A big commerical mess that does not deliver on any of it's promises. RENT DONT BUY - even if your a fan !!!!	-1
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is bar none the worst game tied to a movie license that I've ever played. The graphics are drab and lifeless, the controls are clunky, and the missions are boring and tedious. The game's only saving grace is the plethora of unlockables (CG in-game movies, theatrical clips, behind the scenes clips, stills, etc.) available to you as you progress through the game as well as a playable demo of a much better, currently unannounced, terminator game called T3: Redemption. There were times when I found myself playing the demo rather than the actual game itself. In it, you play as Arnold from a third person perspective as you blast away cyborgs and HK's on foot or on vehicle through a nuclear-scorched Los Angeles. This was the game that I should have been playing, not the rushed hack job I got instead. For die-hard fans, save you money till T3: Redemption comes out. Rise of the Machines by itself, is just an expensive demo.	-1
I needed a new joystick to replace my old thrustmaster and saw they were on sale.  Unfortunately this is way too stiff for a space combat sim  (Star Citizen Alpha).  My Hand and arms were becoming noticeably fatigued in a matter of minutes fighting the tension spring.  Joysticks should come with replaceable springs like gaming mice have replaceable weights.	-1
I have bought this so I could Play Hawx Game and its just not cutting it I have a Xbox 360 Controller and its better than this Random Firing of Missiles for no reason Will be sending it back asap.	-1
Worst joystick I have owned. Constantly loses calibration, PIA to re calibrate, the logitech software is a POS. The button assignments will work for a few days then stop. Ended up taking this joystick and throwing it in the trash.	-1
when I type in xbox 360 joy stick this one and another would be the only 2 too show upthey never stated for PC only AND I GOT IT WAS VERY UNHAPPY. THEY WERE RUDE WHEN i TALK TO THEM i WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN	-1
Ive owned 4 of these Joy Sticks, they are good for a short while but have a problem after extensive use, and become useless after a while. Not recomended for Extensive continious use. The joy stick loosens and will not operate properly in FSX or combast Flight sim or online games. If you only play periodicaly then this is a good resonably priced joy stick. Ive never had one last more than 9 months from purchase.	-1
Logitech has replaced 3 of these Extreme 3D pro joysticks for me under warranty,they all developed the same problem,a "tick"in the joystick. I solved that problem by purchasing a CH Enterprises joystick,much better product,Logitech always took several months to respond to the problem,then after some roaring and snorting at me,they would replace the joystick.	-1
I've bought more expensive joysticks before, and i always came back to this one just because i liked the layout of it.  The problem is though, i've gone through two of these because they tend to wear out pretty easily.  I don't really use joysticks all THAT much, maybe i'd use one for 2-3 hours a week, but i seem to have to buy a new one every year.  Eventually, especially with these logitech ones they get to a point one day where they get so far out of calibration that it's literally impossible to calibrate them back in.  I guess in the future i'm going to just have to buy some high end joystick just so i don't have to keep buying new ones.	-1
F-zero gx is a good gamecube game ill give it that unfortunately the game is way too hard, i don't really mind hard games as long as i'm still having fun but when the games difficulty gets to the point where i'd rather be doing something else that becomes a problem. The games graphics look great especially for a gamecube game and the soundtracks pretty good but i still can't get over the games brutal difficulty for instance after bitterly struggling through the first few races I finally get the end but the last course is filled with jumps and if you accidentally fall of the stage you immediately lose race after just 3 retires its game over all it takes is 3 tiny mistakes on the games final stage and all my hard work goes to waste.  this game will only appeal to f-zero fans and those who enjoy brutally hard games.	-1
this was an okay game. not one of the best racing games i played but it was alright. the graphics and scenry was cool though. but i wouldn't buy it.	-1
The single player action is pretty good. I like to compete on-line too, but there are no servers for it. Game plays all right and if you buy it for single player mode its enjoyable. Multiplayer part of the game brought it down to a 2 star for me.	-1
I waited till Codemasters had released the first patch hoping it would improve the game: it hasn't. The action is slow and awkward and the use of timed missions destroys any illusion that this is a strategy game. The controls are more clunky after the patch then they were before. With all its problems ARMA 2 is a much better game.	-1
the game is OK. It is not bad.  However, if you buy it for the online experience, like I did, you will be 100% disappointed. I guarantee that. This game does not work online if there are more than maybe 4 people, the lag is huge, up to a second, people are randomly kicked and game over.  Again, the multiplayer DOES NOT WORK.	-1
I just started playing this game today and just finish the first mission, which took me about an hour to complete both the main and side missions. I did not bother checking out the multiplayer because I heard that there's no servers and if you do get into one, bunch of people get disconnected. Anyway, here's what I don't like and what I like:  I like the main menu music. I like the graphics in this one compare to OFP. I like the combat sounds too. Picking the weapon you want is easier than OFP by pushing the numbers above your QWERTY keys. AI's are much smarter, making the game more realistic. They will try to outflank you. They will take cover behind trees, rocks, and buildings. Oh yeah, you can swim in this game. In the first OFP, you drown in the water. That's about it.  Now here's what I don't like: 1) Its more complicated to control your squad. Have to cycle through bunch of menus to get the right command I want. 2) As mention with other reviews, no free look when driving. I can't look to my right or left or behind me. 3) No tutorial or training missions. If you are brand new to the game, don't you want to learn how to fight and move and all the other goodies before going to combat? 4) Default key assignments are ridiculous. Push F1 to use binocular? Then you have to hold the right mouse button to use it. I don't think you can even zoom with it. I pushed every button on my keyboard to see if I can zoom, but nope. 5) No ability to lean left or right, which is huge deal when peaking or shooting around corners. 6) If you get into a vehicle first, your squad may sometime go in with you without you having to give them an order. I'm like, "did i order you to get in my vehicle?" 7) You are stuck with the weapon you have before starting the mission! I like the option of choosing different weapons before starting the mission, but apparently it won't let you. 8) When changing weapon, it takes forever for your guy to get that weapon out, especially when you take your rocket launcher out. If you need to get your rifle back out after switching, forget about it. Your dumb guy wants to put a rocket into the launcher first before getting to your other weapon. 9) It is always a 4 man team. Unlike the first OFP where you can control as many as 12 men. However, you are always the team leader from the very first mission. 10) Low lack of vehicles to get into. You are mostly running all over the place. 11) Mission editor sucks b/c there's no preview for it.  I think the main thing the frustrates me the most is giving commands to your squad. This is truly a waste of my $37! Why there's no CD-key? I bought this game b/c I thought I will need a CD-key to play online. APPARENTLY NOT! I bet this game is already free for download on file-sharing programs and you can play online without any CD-key check. Of course, the multiplayer is currently in disarray and they are currently making a patch for this game.  I don't know if future patches to this game will make gaming experience better. They tend to make it better, but I still don't want to cycle through bunch of menus to give orders to my squad. I remember installing patches one by one for OFP and that took forever. You have to install the very first patch to install the most recent patch. You probably will have to do that too for this game as well.  In summary, don't buy this game. Its very disappointing and it doesn't even come close to Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis or OFP Resistance. If they implement the old OFP features with the awesome graphics and sounds, this game would of been the best Operation Flashpoint ever to be made.	-1
Where to start? I guess I'll start by saying how wrong people are when they call this game a "mil sim".  There's so many examples it's hard to choose from, but lets start with a good one.  If you ask the corpsman to heal you.. He gives you a shot of adrenaline (I would have to assume its that and not just some silly yellow colored saline solution). If you give someone adrenaline and they've received some massive trauma you're only going to help KILL the person. If you don't know anything about Adrenaline or how the human body works... Easily put, it's going to make them bleed out faster because adrenaline is going to increase their heart rate which is bad (In this case). Not to mention the animation of the corpsman giving you the shot is horrible, but most animations in this game are - so don't be surprised.  This is honestly more like a mix of call of duty and battlefield 2.  I personally had high hopes for this game. While I was pointing out a lot of its mistakes and problems early on, I've always loved the operation flashpoint games, they were some of my favorites many years ago. But this is a horrible disappointment, at least in regards to it being a "mil sim" and an operation flashpoint game.  Also another big gripe is shooting, sure the sounds sound like they were recorded in a very confined indoor shooting range. So when you're shooting outdoors it sounds terrible and also it seemed as though a lot of the weapons that you fire lack a lot of the bite that their real counterparts have. To me the game felt like there was very little weight, everything felt very "floaty", for the lack of a better word. It's hard to describe but it just didn't feel right from the very beginning.  Also, speaking about shooting, it takes about 5 - 7 rounds, on average, to take down someone. Of course these vary, some less than others depending on the round and placement but the enemies generally just stand there or continue crawling taking hit after hit and the simple fact that it takes SO MANY rounds to take down someone makes this game laughable.  Even a single round or two from an m16 or m4 type variant can easily put someone to the ground even with some sort of armor (It might not kill them but either way they WONT be standing by their own will and strength after that type of impact). You're talking about almost 3,000 fps (Feet per second) from an m4. Obviously, more or less depending on the round, grain, and barrel. Now a round from an m4 or m16 puts out almost 1,680 joules that equates to about 1,238 foot pounds of force. My calculations might be off a little, I'm not much of a math wiz but you still get the idea. That's A LOT of force. Of course' there's always little variables, you can say "Well in this case" or "in this particular instance" but having to take that many shots on the "hardcore" difficulty to take someone down is ridiculous.  Back on point. There are so many mechanics of this game that are so unrealistic that calling this a "mil sim" is a huge slap in the face to anything else that's even halfway realistic.  Not to mention to lack of variants in firearms as well and customization options. You should at least be able to switch out your m4 or what have you with other optics like acogs, eotechs, aimpoints, cco's and such. But no, you're stuck with whats on the rifle. Different rifles have different sights, but there aren't even that many to choose from.  (Also when you shoot people you get a little tick mark on the crosshair, I think that speaks for itself.)  There's also the simple fact that this game is not even that difficult. I probably only died maybe half a dozen to a dozen times or so throughout the course of the campaign and I always play all of my fps games on their hardest difficulty. But I guess that could just be due to my past league xp, being ex cal and cevo main (I know, it's not that big of a deal but it's better than the majority) for games like 1.6, css, cod4, I honestly didn't have much of any difficulty with this game especially with the horrendous ai.  The main problems I did encounter however is with the other members of your fire team.  Often times I had to tell them to board my vehicle, then if a fire fight ensued and I had to leave the vehicle to find some real cover I would find that my team mates were still sitting there and doing (For the most part) nothing. It's just a hassle having to bring up the command menu and telling them to get out of the vehicle every time, although I can see how it might be a benefit. Like if you just had to run out really quick to grab something and didn't want your team to dismount. But more often than naught, it's an annoyance.  The only real use for them is to lay down some sort of suppressing fire if you're advancing on a location like in Brothers in Arms: HH. Or for having them point out obvious (And sometimes not so obvious) threats.  Also if your team is in a vehicle and you look at them they're often just stuck in a single pose. They don't move, they don't do anything at all. They're frozen in a single pose and don't move until something happens. I know it might not sound like something important but if you're playing and you hop out and look at your team mates frozen there it really does kill quite a bit of the experience.  There is also a very limited amount of vehicles you can operate. Don't be fooled in thinking you can fly and drive everything under the sun, well you can... It's just that there's not a lot of variety. I think it's about on par with vehicles on BF2. Maybe more, maybe less. There's something like a total of 50 vehicles however they're not all playable... Well you can play with them in the mission editor so I guess that still counts right?  Multiplayer? What a mess.  First of all, there's no dedicated servers. Which for consoles is ok, but for pc's... Yuck. And it's funny how on the pc packaging it says under its multiplayer requirements that "Dedicated host server are recommended for optimum performance". Neat stuff huh? That might change in the future.. If someone has their own dedicated box that they're willing to host from but as of yet (Or to my knowledge) codemasters hasn't provided any files for hosting the dedicated server.  There's also a very limiting amount of people you can play with.  If you want to play co-op, know that it's only on-line co-op. You can't play co-op offline. And when you're playing online, there's a max of 4 players. There's no ability to "drop in" or "drop out" per say. There's supposedly a max of like 32 people on things like deathmatch and the other non co-op modes. BUT remember, since there's no dedicated servers... Hosting even 20 people is going to be a challenge. You're probably going to find servers from 10 - 16 people max. At least, to have good enough and playable ping.  There's a lot wrong with this game and very few things right. The graphics aren't that great (Trust me, in the videos they look way better) but even with the settings maxed, at 1280x1024, with full aa and all the ingame settings set to full I was left with a big emptiness because this just wasn't what I was looking for. Plus there isn't that many settings to change either. You can't change the draw/view distance, you can't change things like the post effects, or details in the terrain, players, etc.  The textures are terrible on more than one occasion. If you go to your map and zoom in, the map of the island is so low res that it becomes very pixelated before you even zoom all the way in to see your troops. The textures on rocks and the landscape in general are terrible. The uv mapping on them is awful, there's lots of stretching going on and most of it is hidden by the games grass (Which looks pretty awful by todays standards).  Needless to say, I was highly disappointed with this release. However, this game isn't all that bad. Sure, the graphics suck, a lot of the animations are terrible, it's not realistic, the sound isn't even half good. But it's not a completely awful game. This is JUST another badly produced, over hyped, rushed shooter. That's it.  If it was $15 then it might be acceptable but even at $40, it's not worth your time or money.  And don't listen to the operation flashpoint fan boys who rate this as the most amazing game ever. If this was tetris with the operation flashpoint name and called it a "mil sim" there would still be "amazing" reviews about it. Don't listen to the fan boys, you can read tons of reviews from REAL people who have REAL reviews about this all over.	-1
The game is straight forward. You run from one pointer to another, you see enemy where you supposed to see him, you shoot him and do repetitive missions. No tricky tactics, cause anyway everything is scripted. For me its waste of $36 :(. Going to wait for ArmA-2 to get more stable.	-1
I have bought this game on release day and so far I have not managed to connect to a single online server. Every time I attempt it disconnects me and I need to restart the game altogether. When putting a ticket out this is the exact answer I got; "The Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising servers are currently experiencing excess demand, as everyone tries to connect to the game following the worldwide launch. We are working with the company that runs these servers in an attempt to increase this bandwidth, however we would expect demand to reduce following the peak that we expect this weekend, and so you should be able to connect more consistently after this time."  It has been a week and nothing has changed. Buy this game only if your planning to play it single player. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.	-1
Arrived quickly thanks to Amazon but did not work in GameCube. Luckily, I found my original disc and it worked.	-1
This is the most boring game I have ever played for game cube. The techniques are extremely difficult, for example, if you don't hit a certain button at the right time, its an automatic screw up. The game looks nice though, I'll give it that. The game just feels slow and repetitive. I'm so glad that I rented it and didn't buy it. But this is just my opinion. If you like golf, this might be a great game for you. I think I just disliked this game because I think golf is just boring.	-1
mario golf is an awful game. Only 4 secret characters boo,shadow mario,pirrahea piranha,and baby bowser. The game was so limited there was barely anything to do besides for golfing. Stars characters seems pretty damn stupid. The game was very boring and not one bit fun.	-1
Two observations that are outside of the game.  First, do not trust anyone who only writes reviews with 5 star ratings.  These people are either idiots or work for the company.  Second, do not trust anyone who reviews a product before they have seen or played the product all the way through.  Again, such people are either idiots or work for the company. Now, onto, Dark Alliance.  I have played the original Baldur's Gate on the p.c. and have played the first video game version of Baldur's Gate on both the Playstation and the X-box.  All of these games I found very enjoyable and would give them between 3-4 stars. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance deserves one star.  While the graphics are good, they are not as good as the first game and the makers have an annoying habit of making you fight in the dark to (1) make gameplay more difficult (pretty hard to fight when you can't see) and (2) to mask the fact that the graphics are mostly reused from the first game. Little effort went into originality on this game.  The story is incredibly week.  You play an entirely different character from the first game.  Your character has some secret or mystery that must be completed that differentiates him or her from the other characters.  Once you find out your secret or solve your mystery you will be disappointed because of the anticlimactic reaction of your character and your inability to use the information you gained. Not all monsters (including bosses) give good or any treasures. All monsters are incredibly easy to beat (you only need to press one button over and over again to beat 90% of the monsters) with one exception.  Toward the end of the game you will need to reach the two baddest bad guys.  Right before you meet them you ascend a stair case directly into a room filled with monsters who kill you immediately.  This part of the game was insanely difficult unless you have stealth. Overall, a disappointing game with few, if any, highlights.  Save your money for a worthy game such as Legacy of Cain III.	-1
Civilization 3 Gold is really nothing more than the original Civilization 3 game packaged with the first expansion, Civilization: Play the World.  While this may seem like a good deal, you can actually buy the second expansion in the Civilization series, Civilization: Conquests, which is included with the first expansion as well. So if you'd like an even better deal, buy a copy of the original Civilization game (which sells for a VERY cheap price new or used) and then buy the Civilization: Conquests expansion and you'll spend the same amount you would for the Gold Edition, get the expansion Civilization: Play the World as well as new content in Civilization: Conquests.  If you'd like to know what the Gold Edition brings to the table, basically the purpose of the Play the World expansion was to enable multiplayer, a feature once originally promised in the original game.  Atari probably realized it could make more money holding out multiplayer in an expensive expansion pack but if you never gave in to Atari's demands, now is your chance to try it.  Multiplayer is a bit of a disappointment in Civilization.  The online community isn't large and it's not the same thing as randomly joining a server in a first person shooter or other poppular online game because of the dedication required for long online games.  One reason the community isn't that large is because when Play the World was first released it was a buggy disaster! The online game was full of lag no matter what game mode or connection speed you used. Some of the common problems have been fixed with patches but multiplayer has never been a great success with Civilization.  Play the World even introduces a simultaneous turn mode which allows the game to speed up and imitates the mechanics of a real-time strategy game.  Unfortunately, Civ 3 really isn't meant to be a real-time strategy game and it doesn't run as smoothly as a Rise of Nations or Warcraft game would.  If you have a home LAN, that's probably the best way to play Civilization against others.  The most successful method of play is still singleplayer, though, so I recommend you buy the Conquests expansion along with the original Civilization game like I mentioned above because that expansion does a better job adding more features for singleplayer but also comes included with the content in Play the World.	-1
It shipped fast which was good I guess. It would download onto Windows Vista and Windows 8...but when I tried opening it, it said "please get administrators permission and try again" it did this for both computers. I called tech support and they hung up after a little bit. So a bad review for both the game itself and tech support. Now it's too late to send back to Amazon so I'll have to make a trade in to game stop. Very disappointed.	-1
I loved this BUT it doesn't work with Windows 10.... NUTS !!!!	-1
I liked the game for a while but found it rather repetitive. It certainly gives you a lot of gameplay for your buck although I'd have preferred less content in favour of more creativity with the level design. Finding your way through endlessly repeated passageways/decks got real old. Cortana was kind of fun and there were elements that were innovative for its time but overall -- a boring game.	-1
The game is fun and enjoyable. The weapon and vehicle choices are good. I like the game but I get games for multiplayer value. This game has some good maps for multiplayer but... This game does not autoassign teams each game so they can be stacked and if a team wins they remain the same and can just be repetitous with one side abusing that. Also vehicles can be abused and the map design itself especially blood gulch can be just a lame game.  A team can just squat on portals and above hills and spawn kill you and portal ambush you. Players will also portal block you which will force you into one of their other ambushes. The map is also not symmetrical and gives advantage to red or top side.  You would think that before putting it on pc which what originally it was designed for they would have changed that. Glitches and bugs and flaws are still there.  It can be a fun game but online players abusing things and betraying when friendly fire is on ruins it. Free multiplayer but expect cursing and to be frustrated by abuse of game and map flaws.  Glad I own it but sometimes I just prefer a well rounded game like star wars battlefront 2 over this flawed creation.	-1
I bought the game, based on all the hype about H3 and H2 for Vista.  It was OK, but frankly, HL, a game of the same era was more interesting.  Maybe I am just jaded by the current generation of games such as HL2 EP2 or BioShock.  In any case, OK for an older game, just don't pay much for it at this point in its existance.	-1
If you asked what my favourite type of computer game was, it would be the first-person shooter. So I was pretty excited when I finally got my hands on this game, a so-called revolutionary game for the genre. Revolutionary, huh? This game is so regressive that I have to wondor what drugs its fans are taking and whether or not they'd mind sharing some with me. Quite frankly, its mediocre at best.  OK, it does have its good points. The graphics are fairly nifty, the aliens aren't stupid and the ability to drive is a definate plus. However, the level design is shocking. The game looks monotonous. The weapons don't feel at all meaty and you can only carry two of them at a time. The sound effects are simply horrible - from the muffled gun shots to the ridiculous squeeling coming from aliens that look like lumps of trifle and walk like penguins.  On top of this, it seems you need to have an absolute top of the range computer to run the damn thing with it jerking around. I'm on an AMD Semptron 1.6ghz with 512mb of RAM and an ATi Radeon 9200 graphics card. Not top of the range I know, but that's more than twice the processor power and four times the RAM the game claims is required to play this game. Its not like I have the settings on maximum for crying out loud.  When compared to the Half-Life games or the Medal Of Honour games for example, Halo falls very short. As someone who's been playing this genre since Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, I can definately tell you that I have seen and enjoyed much better.	-1
I have heard quite a bit of hype about Halo this and Halo that. So I got it. And much like several other reviewers on this board, I had graphics difficulty from minute one. My system is pretty good, MS XP, 3.06GHz P4, 1 GB RAM, 128MB Radeon 9800. I run Doom 3 at pretty decent levels as well as Call of Duty and other fairly new games. So there just isn't any excuse for the ridiculously slow graphic performance I got. I don't know if the problem is the game's engineering or what, but I am disappointed.	-1
I was hearing soooooooooo much of this game from my friends, "It's the best," blah blah blah blah. So I bought it. First of all my system is an Athlon XP 1800+ with nVidia FX 5200 128mb, and 512mb ram, I know it isn't a beast but it can play most games at 1024x768 with medium gfx. Anyway I set this game at what I usually have games set at. And it was studder city. I noticed many other people have had this problem also. So in other words it was very poorly put together. After messing around with the video settings I got it to run decent. Then I felt my efforts were wasted after playing the game. It is SOOOOOOOO HIGHLY OVERRATED. I've played many other better fps's than this. All you really do is wonder aimlessly and blast away everything you see. Thats about it. No varity. And the muti-player REALLY sucks. This game is like many other Microsoft games, Good GFX and Poor Gameplay. I believe the only reason it did any good on Xbox is because it was the only good game for Xbox when it first came out (infact Xbox still barly has any good games ;) I would reccomend call of duty or Medal of honor if you really want a good game.	-1
Halo for pc is not only outdated, but not very fun. There is no strategy at all involved, and its a very repeditive shooter. There is MASSIVE backtracking in most of the levels that makes you go through hallways youve already seen to flip a swich. Eventually it gets extremely boring when you are wandering through the same grey room filled with enemies for the 50th time. The game just isn't very fun. It was bad on the Xbox and now its bad on the PC. If you really want to play it for some reason wait untill it costs less than $15. Untill then just avoid it.	-1
This is a horrible game, average graphics, bad controls,and unrealistic. ex. when you sniper someone it leaves a white trail on bullet, i thought snipering was being covert not on this game! overall a bad 1st person shooter.	-1
This version of Halo is really frustrating. In addition to all the other frustrations voiced, the online play is horrendous. It is the slowest first person shooter online of any game I've played. And I've played a ton of them. I had a straight ethernet hookup to my campus's network. My average bandwidth was about 2.7 Meg/sec. That's about 20 times the average bandwidth of DSL (I'm talking average, not peak). I have a 2.4 Gig processor with 512 meg ram and a radeon 9600 video card. I was STILL having lag. It was almost comical it was so bad sometimes. If I was hosting, I would find that the poor people who had DSL or, heaven forbid, dial-up would be shooting in a totally different direction than where I was because the network didn't update our positions quickly enough. Anyone who has this game knows what I'm talking about. The real travesty of this game is that the multiplayer maps are INCREDIBLE. They are 10 times better than Halo for Xbox, which is why this game is so frustrating: you have no chance to fully enjoy playing your friends because the whole multiplayer experience is just one big lagfest. To get a better idea of how unpopular this has become, go to bungie.net and click on their link to Halo for PC. Take a quick gander at how many people are playing at any given time. I just checked and it was 2455. This is worldwide, mind you. Doesn't that seem rather low? Even now, over 10 times that many people are playing Starcraft, a dinosaur compared to Halo. I have sold my copy of Halo PC to some poor schmoe. (Sorry, poor schmoe). Someday maybe in 100 years when I have bionic implants to sustain my pathetic life and the world is on a fiber optic network, you will catch me playing Halo for PC. In the meantime, I guess Starcraft will have to do... For Adun!	-1
Alright, I understand companies need to make money, but they should not have put halo on PC.  Should have stayed on xbox where it belongs.  After two years of the game being out, any one who really wanted it would have bought an xbox and played it there.  The graphics are not "souped up for pc".  They are shakey and choppy because  A) the game was ported, and sloppily.  Plays infinetly smoother on xbox  B) meant to be played with a controller, not a mouse, so it jerks all over the place if you move to quickly. HALO 2 will be on xbox first, and then the same thing will happen: they will put it on PC to earn some quick cash.  That's it.  You want halo?  Buy an xbox.  Blah.	-1
This game was no fun when i flew through it. sure i beat it i patiently went to the end of the game so i have a right to write this review and i still hated the game. I don't mind the story still i don't care graphics are not that great efcets are average i seen better and more of all my pc has trouble running texture of land inside buildings more than 5 aliens my computer goes dead slow. I don't know how i got through last parts with those yellow things. In games like UT2K4 graphics are pretier i never lagg or suffer slow frame rate and i did npot even patch it yet. ON the other hand later i played Xbox version MUCH BETTER so fluid and actiony. I cant think much more of things to say beside i hate this game and those 50$ i spend where not worth it. i should have bought far cry or something. I WILL BURN THIS COPY YOU SHOULD2!!!!!	-1
_You know...I am an absolute Halo fan...for Xbox anyway.  I played at my friend's house...we had 4 xbox's hooked up, with 4 peeps on each.  I swear...that was the epitomy of all gaming.  It...was almost a religious experiance for me.  I cannot possibly describe how much fun it was. _Alas, I do not own an Xbox, nor do I ever plan to own one.  I do not buy an expensive console system for the only game worth playing on it.  So...when the PC version was coming out, I was overly thrilled.  I wanted to be able to play the main game...experiance the storyline I heard so much about...play in large multiplayer games that didn't take months of planning to get 4 xbox's in one house. _I read up on it, in magazines and in newspapers.  Reviewers hit it hard for it's graphics and lack of coop main game play.  This didn't phase me.  I could live with that.  I think every game is infinitely better with coop mode and multiplayer, but for Halo, I could do without coop.  I could also live with reduced graphics.  So, I went about getting the game. _When it comes out, my computer crashes, so I have to wait.  Finally, I get a BRAND NEW computer.  Halo is one of the first things I get, because I simply can't wait.  I read the min requirements before I buy it...which is absolutely deceiving. First row will be the system requirement for the game, second row will be what I have. 733 hmz processer  |  3.2 GHZ 1.2 GB hard drive space  |  65 GB free 32 MB video card | 128 MB Geforce II 128 MB ram  |  512 MB _So I get it and install it on my computer.  Theoretically, this game should fly on it's best settings.  Especially because I see the graphics, and I have larger games with better graphics that run perfectly smooth.  But what happens?  I get into the game, and I think it's paused because I try to move and nothing happens.  12 seconds later, I'm suddenly in a new spot.  Serious, serious lag time. _Dissapointed that the game isn't running on highest graphics settings, I decide to put it on lowest, and progress higher until I find a comfortable medium.  Well...the game doesn't even run on minimum settings.  It runs better, but not at any playable speeds.  Clocked at about 1 frame / 5 seconds. _I figure there may have been some coding error in the game, so I connect and download a patch from microsoft.  I was almost correct.  The game runs now at 2/frames per second.  So, I'm a lot closer to playable than I used to be, but it's still unplayable.  Wasted money. _I try multiplayer, thinking that perhaps it is just the campaign mode that's bad.  But it isn't.  Multiplayer is just as bad, though thankfully not worse.  You'll be happy to know, though, that once you get killed and your carcass is falling to the ground, there is no lag at all!  THAT runs perfectly smoothly.  However, I played a 45 minute game OL, and never got to leave my base.  There were 3 snipers around the base, in an 8 vs 8 game.  And I had a bullet through my head as soon as I respawned.  Lag wouldn't kick in for about 3 seconds, so I tried to run, but alas cheap cowardly idiots had me and 6 others of my team constantly dead...with progressively longer respawn times, of course.  Interesting how I never got to leave my respawn point, or even my base area.  I'm told this is par for Halo, so even the multiplayer I wanted to partake in was flawed.  The servers are chocked full of cheap snipers. _Don't get me wrong.  Snipers are fine if you're defending your flag or a strategic point for your team or whatnot.  But...when you kill the enemy within their own base AS they respawn...that's going overboard.  There should be a system where if you snipekill a person within 3 seconds of them respawning, you get killed and have to sit out for 5 minutes.  Because, newsflash, those people are there so they can play, not die where they spawn and watch the clock tick away how long they have until they can rejoin. _I know I sound crazy, but the only possible way a smaller game with horrid graphics can run that badly is deliberate sabatoge of the code.  Microsoft, I'm sure, did this to prevent TOO many purchases of the PC version, and help out it's Xbox by keeping it's only good title more afloat.  So, for now I search OL to find someone who's hacked the code and made it playable. _I see a man selling bootleg Microsoft software every day on my way to work.  I never respected him for what he does.  The day after I got Halo, I walked up to him, shook his hand, and donated $50 to his cause.  Told him, "Good job", and caught my bus. _This game just isn't worth the web space to trash talk it.	-1
Here comes,the very long awaited,HALO!!!BOOOOM!its over,its gone...I can't beleive that i wasted so much money for this! The quetion is,what's good about this game??I've played great games like Medal of Honour,Call of Duty,Warcraft etc. But this game sucks. Ok,the graphics are great,but couldn't Microsoft think of the magic words 'Fun and Exciting'?The company has created award winning games like Age of Empires,AOM etc. But this one is at the bottom of the list. Don't waste your money on it.	-1
I just can't get excited about this game.  Outdated, unintertesting and a lag in the mouse that I just couldn't seem to get rid of.  Even handing this one off to a friend didn't win it anymore stars with more complaints of mouse problems and boring play.  Skip this one, get something without the dated graphics and boring play.	-1
For the most part I enjoyed this game. I gave it a rating of 1 star to get your attention and to point out that this is only HALF a game. It offers both single player and online multiplay. If you love multiplayer games and have a broadband connection...this game is awesome. WARNING - Most of the Halo Multiplayer servers, groups and games I played were filled with immature 14 year olds that curse 4 letter words at you and accuse you of cheating all the time because they can't shoot straight. I prefer more mature surroundings! If you are looking for a great single player experience...forget it. First of all the graphics are pretty...but dated. Look at UT 2003 on a high end vid card and compare it to Halo. Halo is bland, the levels are redundant. The outside levels are pretty but nothing impressive. Even on the hardest settings this game is way too scripted, the enemy AI is pathetic and predictable. It is not intelligent AI. All the programmers did was setup scripted actions and triggers to generate hoardes and hoardes of enemies to come at you at set intervals as you proceed through a level.  Want to beat them easily? Say your in a level exploring...just walk slowly until you trigger some enemies to appear, back track a bit for protection and keep your back to a wall. Kill the enemies as they approach, then step back to where you triggered the enemies, see if you can trigger more and repeat these instructions until you are clear. Proceed and investigate further until you trigger more enemies. Repeat this strategy throughout the level and the rest of the game. If you get into a heated, heavy battle, just use cover...pop out, shot some aliens and duck again. They almost never pursue you. Only the weird, mutants chase you. Just shotgun them. Nice and simple. There are some tiny little parasite style aliens that are more annoying than dangerous. Don't waste your ammo on them, just let them crash into your shield, let your shield recharge and proceed. PIECE OF CAKE. I walked through this game on the hardest settings, without breaking a sweat, the AI is disappointing. Not horrible, but very PREDICTABLE. Online Multiplay is where this game shines...the weapons are so-so...but having vehicles to drive around is a blast. If you are thinking of buying this title...I would wait. February 3rd, 2004 is the release of Unreal Tournament 2004. ************ Unreal Tournament 2004 ********** It has vehicles, awesome weapons, a huge online following and BOT AI that will bring you to your knees. I have sampled the beta versions of it and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
This game is boring. I don't know what the big fuss about it is...the multiplayer is BORING...it's not even exciting. Graphics are amazing...boring, stupid plot though. Try Call of Duty for a good FPS this year.	-1
But releasing it so late for the PC makes it an unworthy competitor to today's top FPS games like UT2003/Unreal 2, America's Army: Operations, the upcoming AA: Special Forces, and other FPS games. Halo multiplayer is also extremely flawed. In Blood Gulch, good banshee pilots will simply start spawn killing and the opposing team won't be able to get a foothold in the battle (CTF). Or worse, you have team killers who also ruin the fun. The banshee and warthog interface isn't what I expected. If they used the Descent engine for the Banshee, and Rallisport Challenge for the Warthog, then it'd be one heck of a game. Overall, it's not worth the money to buy this game since it's already 2 years old. Save your money for something up to date and more fun.	-1
I can honestly say that I loved Halo on the XBOX.  Yes, the levels were repetitive, but the combat was revolutionary!  For those of you that don't know - the XBOX joystick has (among other buttons) 2 thumbsticks (one for each thumb).  Halo was the first FPS for the XBOX - so the Bungie programmers had to decide what these two joysticks controlled.  They chose so well that countless other programmers have copied them, and those that didn't - wish they had!  One thumbstick controls the motion of your character based upon the direction he is looking.  The other joystick controls which direction the character looks.  Did I mention that the Xbox jostick has triggers for both of your index fingers?  Within 10 minutes of playing Halo on the XBOX - I was pretty good.  Within 48 hours - I was one lethal trash-talking Marine!  I have two problems with the PC version.  First, let me prefix this by stating that I am running Halo on a P4 2.4-HyperThreaded/800MHz FSB/512MB/XP Pro/Nvidia GeForceFX 5600 Ultra 128MB.  Suffice it to say that I should be able to play EVERYTHING (expect for DOOM 3) at the highest detail level while having processing power to spare.  Guess what?  When playing Halo for the PC and there are more than 2 aliens on the screen - my system begins to crawl under the strain.  This is in the very beginning - imagine what will happen when I reach THE FLOOD (hundreds of aliens at a time)?  This is unacceptable.  But it is a shame that somebody messed-up Halo PC, because there will be gamers that will never know how awesome the game really is.  My second problem is actually more of a realization.  I now realize that Halo was so revolutionary because of the two-thumbstick/trigger controller.  It is extremely intuitive to control movement with one thumb while looking with the other thumb while firing your weapons with actual triggers.  The keyboard cannot begin to compete.  I read a review on a reputable gaming website that basically stated the exact opposite - he loved Halo on the keyboard.  To each his own - I guess.  Make up your own mind, but I suggest each of you just try it on the Xbox for 10 minutes to see "what all the fuss is about!"	-1
I loved Halo on the Xbox. Truly the first or second best shooter on any platform. "Half Life on the PC is the other contender". On my Multimedia super killer Dell wide screen notebook with the new Pentium M processor, Nvidia FX 5650 Go Video with 128 mb video RAM and 1 gig of main memory, Halo performance is abysmal. I figured the others who said this may have been a bit over the top. They werent! For Microsoft to have released this piece of drek is irresponsible in the extreme. It is the full Halo game and if you set to the higher resolutions, the scenery is Gorgeous, But, But, But! Unfortunately, even with virtually all the pretty video features turned off and resolution set down to an abysmal 800x600, the massive frame rate (and motion update) slowing (to as bad as less than 1 frame per second) that takes place whenever major scene motion occurs (especially in the middle of gunfights and always during in battle reloading). Make the game practically unplayable. I completed Halo on the Xbox in Normal and Heroic mode. But the PC version in standard mode is going to be a real challenge because the frame rate and sluggish mouse update are so bad. Really, Really Bad. There were things that could have been done to fix these issues before release, but lets face it with Halo2 looming, Microsoft had to dump it out here now to have any chance of selling it at all. Half Life works on the PC and has a truly excellent interface. They do use lower resolution figures and scenery, but the whole thing works together. Halo on the PC is on the other end of that spectrum. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS AWFUL! Go out and buy an XBox and get Halo for it. XBox Halo, alone is worth buying an XBox for. The only thing of value in the PC version is the Box it comes in.	-1
Halo is a fun game, no doubt. The graphics are pretty, the gameplay is challenging, and the storyline is fantastic. Everyone knows the single-player game is phenomenal; the single-player game in this PC version is identical to the Xbox version. What this PC version adds to the Halo experience is true online multiplayer. And it's terrible. Oh, the new weapons (flamethrower, fuel rod cannon) and vehicles (Banshee, various Warthogs) are neat. The maps are okay. It's the lame players that drives Halo multiplay into the ground. At the time of this writing multiplayer Halo is filled with dweebs who enjoy nothing more than killing their own teammates while swearing in all caps. This is not fun. Worse, cooperative play through the single-player storyline--easily Halo's best feature--is simply absent. Inexplicably, there is no way to play through the game alongside a pal. Other PC games (Serious Sam, Tom Clancy games) have featured cooperative gameplay. Halo PC supports over a dozen simultaneous players. Halo Xbox had cooperative play. So... why is this feature absent? It makes no sense, and it makes the game much less appealing. Stay away from this game until a patch implements such standard multiplayer controls as Banning, Voting, and auto-kicking for excessive TKs.	-1
I have a Pentium 4 2.8 GHz, a GeForce 5900 FX 256 MB, and 512 MB of RAM. Apparently I'm exactly the sort of person that Gearbox HATES. I have to run this at an atrocious 800x600 to get remotely smooth 30fps performance. And even if I turn all of the bells & whistles on and set everything up to max and it become a 12 frames per hour slideshow, the graphics STILL don't even come close to the quality of the Xbox version. Very disappointing. I was looking forward to playing Halo with mouse/keyboard support and better graphics. It simply isn't happening. I'll stick to my Xbox for now, thanks.	-1
It is too unrealistic. You feel like quiting on the first lap it is so boring the cars are slow and have bad handling. the graphics are choppy and pausey. This game is for fools. If you want a good racing game expeirience get NFS4 or NR2003 Season instead of this game. Their is only 1 thing good about it. it is cool to wreck that slow, poorly designed car.	-1
Good game, but the same. Every year they make a new a NHL game, NHL 2000, NHL 2001, and so on. Its all the same, exept maby better graphics, and changed teams. This goes the same to Fifa, and other EA sports games. They basicly have the same idea. If you are gonna buy NHL 2004, don't waste you're money on NHL 2005, when it comes out, because its gonna be the same! My point is, if you buy NHL 2004, thats it don't buy next 1, wait a 1000 years and then buy a new 1 which will be NHL 3004 ;) So if you have NHL 2002 or 2003, don't get NHL 2004, its not worth the money. :-)	-1
oh no! there goes all the excitement I'd rather go back to playing NHL2001 it actually has more options than 2004. This game is terrible..even though i've only played it for 5 minutes..i already know. The game play is really slow. They took away alot of fun features. The deflected shot, the back to back passing, Bill Clement, do i care who sings the songs? get rid of that stupid box! there is no more stat keeper for your self and your friends don't buy this..there's only disappointment.	-1
Rushhour is CRUCIAL to the satisfactory play of Simcity 4. The game was released as the game, then this Rushhour expansion , then the combination (called SC4 Deluxe). Since the Deluxe version is available in several forms (which include Rushhour) it is just crazy to pay this kind of money for the expansion alone. I don't normally rate things based on cost, but in this case a downgrade is warranted. This rating is for THIS expansion offer  You may want to check out the CD version&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0000C0YW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition</a>, the downloadable version&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition-Download/dp/B00457VJ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download</a>] (also available on STEAM) and though most MAC users run it on Windows emulators, the Aspyr version&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sim-City-4-Deluxe-Mac/dp/B000AHS0BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sim City 4 Deluxe (Mac)</a>.

god this game isn't as good as i remember it being	-1
The first was much better	-1
Players are not different enough cause you only get Tiger. I dislike how putting is done. Too many arcade elements for a "sim" game. CPU AI is not worth playing against.	-1
I put this game down after just a couple of hours.  I like role playing, puzzle solving and exploration games...this is not one of those.	-1
The Xbox version is sooo much better in all respects.  Xbox forever!!!	-1
this game no longer supports online play!!! find something else and don't waste your hard-earned bucks!	-1
IF you like fighting in videogames you should check out this game. The fighting is spectacular. You just beat down those orcs with your arrows and swords, its a really fun time. The orcs are different and have different features. Also whats new from the Two Towers version is the you have more characters to play with, especially Gandalf. But, most of these characters exept for Gandalf are unlock until later in the game which is unfortunate. It doesn't follow the movie like I thought it would. But, you can see clips from the Return of the King movie mixed in with the game. The reason i hate this game is because when your playing two player campaign you have to save on two different files and it gets mixed up all the time. The saving system is a joke. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME. It's horrible.	-1
Did not work!	-1
Review update  1/23/13  So I had the Two Towers game for Gamecube back when it first came out in 2002 and I loved it, and played the ass out of it.  But by the time this one came out, I had either lost interest or couldn't be bothered to spend money on buying it.  Where the previous game was smooth, streamlined, and somewhat tempered in its hacking n slashing so that hacking and slashing half a dozen opponents was overwhelming yet rewarding in a way that some hack n slashes do with half a hundred opponents in the same time.  It had the original voice actors playing themselves, even unlockable interviews with them talking about it and their recording.  It even had incentives to replay levels using each character over again.  Nine years later, I returned to the games, and played this one.  Everything about the previous game that was good seems to be completely and thoroughly wasted or rendered useless in this game.  The graphics are somewhat improved for the characters, but the drab color scheme (a questionable decision given that this game covers more areas and different characters) and stunningly awful enemy designs mean that while you could easily discern Orcs from Goblins from Uruk-Hai, including the big orcs who were like Uruk-Hai, and the incredibly annoying Uruk-Hai with no shirt who would always knock you down with his one-handed sword, in this game you can almost never tell the difference (if there even is any) between the various types of Orc.  Adding to the monotony of the color is perhaps the most mind-numbingly awful methods of ramping up gameplay difficulty from the previous game.  Virtually every bad game design decision that could be implemented here was implemented;  - The camera positioning is hideous and you frequently end up being unable to see your own character for long periods of time, or running headlong against the side of the screen, only to be suddenly attacked at the last moment by a horde of enemies you were apparently charging straight into blindly.  Some specific examples include the wall battle of Minas Tirith, a pretty blatant copy of the wall battle of Helms Deep from the previous game, only this time with you as Gandalf and with constant annoying little secondary objectives that give the enemy far too much time to swarm the wall, such as rushing to catapults to fire on enemy siege towers, despite them ALREADY HAVING TEAMS OF MEN AT THE CATAPULTS FULLY CAPABLE OF PULLING THE SWITCH TO FIRE.  The camera angling is so terrible that you can never actually see the staircase you're supposed to walk up to find the catapults.  The game never even hints how you get to them, and it was literally only dumb luck that I found the camera shifted when I reached a certain blind spot, showing me these stairs.  Another horrendous example comes when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive on Pelennor Fields, and must go through a gauntlet of taking out Oliphaunts one at a time.  Aside from the afore-mentioned face-palming stupidity exercise that this is, the game constantly goes to cut scene to show you the arrival of each and every single new Oliphaunt, as well as the Witch-King arriving, thus leaving your character frozen in place while random Uruks and Eastern Men swarm your position; if you had virtually no health (and you almost certainly will) you pretty much instantly die as soon as the cutscene is done.  And the way the cutscene is shot makes it difficult to tell which side of a massive canyon you should be on in order to shoot at the Oliphaunt.  - Ridiculous difficulty levels involving health and damage.  At the very least for this game, you can purchase combo and weapon upgrades that apply to ALL characters rather than you own, with a discount to offer incentive toward this while having a need to keep upping your best characters to meet future challenges.  Despite this, difficulty isn't raised by having smarter opponents or tougher battles, but simply by lowering your health drastically and lowering your weapon damage drastically, then by doubling the amount of enemies thrown at you.  Whereas the previous game's health bar was well balanced with its green for good, yellow for mildly damaged, orange for seriously damaged, and red for near-death, and a good player almost always managing to keep yellow or better, no amount of skill will keep players from spending more than half the time in red health, bordering on dying.  This wouldn't be so frustrating if not for the fact that the game seemingly doesn't expect this, and thus has the health bar constantly FLASHING at the bottom of the screen when you're in red.  This is exacerbated by incredibly bad combos.  Despite using some of the same button sequences as the previous game, combos here are poorly executed, with some of the most important ones being so slow in execution that they only work against an opponent one on one; if there is a second opponent, he need only shove you roughly to completely break the combo and send you staggering back.  This means combos are as likely to fail as they are to work properly, and even worse, don't do enough damage to kill most of the time; when there's few, if any combos that allow for sweeping attacks or splash damage, knocking one opponent down for a second before moving on to another is just as much a waste of time as simply mashing A repeatedly, with the exact same results achieved.  At the very least, you can block attacks with your attack instead of having to press B constantly (though this works best).  And even worse is being knocked down; unlike the previous game, when you're knocked down by ANYTHING (be it a gargantuan Orc champion, a troll, or a dog-sized spider) you stay down for 3 full seconds, unmoving, and take another 2-3 seconds just getting up.  In the midst of fast-hack-n-slash gameplay, particularly in the Pelennor Fields where 6 seconds is long enough to miss your chance to kill the Oliphaunt and spook the Witch King away from Merry and Eowyn, this is deadly, not to mention a colossal waste of time with regards to action.  I cannot even imagine how this decision to make rising such a sluggish action was considered and implemented unless there's a future upgrade to speed up rising time (though about 50% of the way into the game, it's not anywhere to be seen).  - Long-winded missions with multiple sub-objectives and poorly spaced out checkpoints.  This section alone topples the entire game, in my opinion.  It is absolutely gamebreaking and the true definition of "an exercise in face-palming stupidity"  The Two Towers' missions were typically lengthy, with frequent checkpoints and clear-cut objectives, like "Kill 40 Uruk-Hai, run this way to protect Frodo, kill 10 Uruk-Hai, kill Uruk boss", it was mostly about rushing through maze-like levels, killing, doing stuff, killing, and boss fights.  Here, they implement so many sections that in some cases bring the gameplay to a screeching halt so you can try and fail over and over to figure out their completely pointless little puzzle section, or try and fail over and over as they throw complicated objectives on top of being swarmed by hundreds of opponents.  Some of the absolute worst examples include:  Samwise in Shelob's lair.  There are little sections that serve absolutely no purpose except to waste time, in which Sam has to pick up a conveniently placed torch and throw it in the middle of a pile of little spiders in order to clear them from his path.  Rather than just using it once or twice to teach us to use the Z button for interactions, they implement it as a primary level feature, and there's literally one section where you have to do it three times in a row to reach a locked door, only to realize YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN GOING BACK WHERE YOU STARTED in order to climb up past ANOTHER series of spiders and torches.  The Big Three in the Ghost lair.  More than once, you're forced to button-mash the Z button to turn a wheel that lowers a bridge while ghostly archers shoot at you, balancing between deflecting their arrows and working on the bridge.  Not only is this so easy that you could just stand there as half the arrows simply glitch past you due to piss-poor collision detection, but sometimes a cutscene showing the bridge lowering wastes several seconds.  Other times, the game simply demands ridiculously over the top objectives and gives you literally nothing to work with.  In these circumstances, even lowering the difficulty does nothing to change the impenetrable grind in some of these levels.  The design is not one of any sort of challenge or skill or talent, but literally face-palming stupidity and repetition until you finally overcome the odds by sheer statistics.  It's the very action of the saying "the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting different results".  And unlike the previous game, your allies are completely and utterly useless; they will never ever successfully kill more than one enemy in the time you've taken out five or six or more and moved on.  Sometimes they won't even attack, but just stand still in front of an enemy until that enemy decides to ignore them and attack you.  Some of the worst offenders include the aforementioned level in the Ghost cave, where you inexplicably have to fight some ghosts.  Random rocks will burst out of the ground, blocking your progress until you defeat a bunch of ghosts somehow.  As well, if you get too close to the ghosts, they can pretty much insta-kill you, sending you right the hell back to the start of the level or the start of the checkpoint.  There's literally nothing you can do to avoid this but try again and do the exact same thing over again.  Similarly, the aforementioned Pelennor Fields gauntlet of "I have to do everything because everyone else is too effing stupid" tasks, in which to start, you have to kill 60 east men, but not Orcs.  I specifically say not Orcs, because they don't count towards the 60, and because there's as many of them on the field as there are east men.  Why east men only instead of Orcs, no effing idea why, since the overall objective means you could be fighting wild deer or gremlins or inanimate objects and the result as well as the task would be exactly the same; killing these 60 eastermen doesn't matter at all; the respawn infinitesimally and after you finish this pointless objective, you move on to the real mission.  And this "warm up" isn't even vital to the actual mission; you could literally just run past the field and set up camp on the cliffs overlooking the canyon where the Oliphaunts spawn, but the combination of pointless objective and incredibly awful camera angling means you're literally lost in the fray and have no idea where to even go once you've finished the objective.  And the sheer number of Orcs and East Men spawned and thrown at you in this phase makes it so difficult that it should be in some way relevant; I've died and had to restart so often in this spot, I could have finished entire levels of this same long-winded game in the amount of time I spent dealing with flimsy combos which left me wide open to attack by the 50,000 other enemies surrounding me, being knocked over long enough for another 50,000 to trample me, and spending so much time with red blinking health on the brink of death while mashing B to block 50,000 blades all attacking me that I could reach Perfect Mode two times over just from the blocks, and have no avenue open to even attack anyone!  ALL of those events (aside from the obvious number exaggeration) happened to me in this one effing level!!!  And the punchline is; this isn't the first time you're put in such a situation.  An earlier level has the exact same setup; you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of Orcs spawning on you, and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score, with no end in sight, and no mission objective in sight.  Unlike the Pelennor Fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing 60 East Men, this level (forgot which) had NO such objective, and NO clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doing!  IF you survived long enough, the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the Orcs.  This WOULD have made sense if the Orcs were actually IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH.  Instead, they're literally on the EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE, so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the Orcs, but to COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM AND RUN AWAY.  And you only learn this AFTER being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to why.  Back to the Pelennor Fields level, another layer of insanity/stupidity comes with the Witch King; he randomly appears to fly over Eowyn and Merry and apparently do nothing.  They take damage, but the Witch King neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them.  You're supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away.  Not only does this occur while the Oliphaunts still come (and taking them down is a tedium all in itself) but if the Oliphaunts make it to Eowyn and Merry, you instantly fail the mission, and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission, because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down, and either the Witch King or an Oliphaunt kills Merry and Eowyn.  And making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that Orcs and East Men KEEP SPAWNING THIS WHOLE TIME and they KEEP rushing at you to attack you!  So sometimes you don't even need to be just a bit too slow; you could be distracted by them rushing you, wasting your time, while the Oliphaunt trudges closer, or the Witch King kills off Eowyn and Merry.  And this literally happens to me every time: When I try to target the Witch King to shoot arrows at him, ONE enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me... and my bow's targetting targets HIM instead of the Witch King, and thus far I've found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bow's aim OFF the goddamn bat and ON the goddamn Witch King.  At this rate, it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wall-banging repetition and stupidity.  It's become for me the go-to guide on how not to make an action game.  Despite the playable gameplay elements for hacking and slashing, unless you want to move past stage 1, you're SOL.	-1
One question? Isn't this the same game as the two towers. Besides the fact that there of course different missions and different characters, its practitally the same game as before. Pros: Good graphics Good music Lots of characters Fun missions Cons: ITS THE SAME GAME AS TWO TOWERS. THE SAME POINT AS TWO TOWERS. PRACTICALLY THE SAME MOVES AS TWO TOWERS. SAME MUSIC AS TWO TOWERS. (I still like it though) THE LAST BOSS FIGHT WITH GOLEM SUCKS! Overall, this game...is fun, but the the exact same as before.	-1
The Lord of thr Rings the Return of the King video game is a good game, but it has one problem.... the checkpoints are to far appart! Way to far apart! It is really anoying because I  spent  about one hour playing the game. I was doing really good but then I had to face this cave troll, unfortunatly it had alot of armor so it was hard to kill. So then I died and I went all the way back to my last checkpoint, and quess what, I got that chectpoint about one hour before I died so it was like that entire hour never happened. So I sugest you never get this game. Of course you can use the game for nice firewood. Yeah thats it the game will make exillent firewood. If you want a good game I sugest Metal Arms, Halo, Halo 2 (when it comes out), or PGR2 (Project Gothem Racing 2).  Any of those games are fine, but don't get The Return of the King video game unless you want good firewood.	-1
Breakthrough takes the wonderful legacy of the original Medal of Honor game and pounds it into the ground. This game is an abject failure on nearly every level. The strategy of EA (or whoever is responsible for over-hyped franchised expansion packs) is to throw overwhelming numbers of Nazis at you in nearly every level until you freak out or quit the game out of the frusteration of lag. Breakthrough offers no innovative improvements from the original and will make you start to question whether you actually enjoyed the original game. Yes, that's actually how bad it is. If you thought Spearhead was a dissapointment, brace yourselves for this disaster. Save your money and buy something else. Boo!	-1
I've been an avid Medal of Honor Allied Assault fan since the original. I have played every single mission and beat them with flying colors. The original was the greatest. It had everything from sneaking into a German facility, wearing an SS unform, to the invasion of Omaha Beach. MOHAA was original, yet very realistic. Spearhead sort of strayed from this when it had you, an American paratrooper with the 101st Airborne Division jump into Normandy and find yourself fighting alongside British soldiers, and then a short time after that in Berlin with the Russians. You had a chance to use the new weapons of these countries, but it seemed too staged to be real. Breakthrough completely broke through my long-time respect for the Medal of Honor legacy. You did the same old thing you did in Spearhead, but in Italy. Realism took a turn for worse as the developers tried to make you feel surrounded. But, what happens is enemy troops will literally appear out of nowhere. Another problem I found was that they NEVER give you enough ammo...And don't say I waste, because I've never ran into this problem before. Also, not to mention the idiotic mission plots and objectives. The third or so mission requires you to liberate a fully-functional and guarded German POW camp in Italy. Not so bad, eh? It requires you to do so ALL BY YOURSELF. And furthermore, by the time I reached it, I had no ammo left. This wasn't any fluke, either. It's happened to me many times in Breakthrough. I think the best advice I can give to you is, "Don't waste your money." This is not the Medal of Honor you know and love. It is an attempt to prolong the Medal of Honor series that, as you know, is fading away. This is just the same old stuff, folks... Nothing new.	-1
This is the buggiest game I've ever purchased, and it does not stand up to EA Games shining (but rapidly fading) history.  For example:  I've been stuck on a rooftop early in the game covering some guy name Klaus while he picks the lock on a door.  Meanwhile, Nazis are coming out of the woodwork.  After about the 10th try, he finally opens the door and we go to the bottom of the stairs where . . . nothing happens.  The game is stuck.  I cannot walk past him, and he just stands there.  I go back outside and nothing happens for several minutes.  Eventually the Nazis show back up and I run out of ammo.  This makes no sense because we supposedly on a covert mission, and we should be running away once through the door. In addition, the graphics engine is severely showing its age, and overall the gameplay, AI, etc. is way behind.	-1
I was a ctually waiting in anticpation of this game when i heard of it but once i got it it was frustrating. Icouldn't even install it, and that was even after i traded with three different copies, my system is a p4 1.9ghz with a geforce 3 so it should've worked but didn't. avoid it save your money	-1
didnt work	-1
I hated this game. I mean, it's just pinball, (my least favorite arcade game,) if you don't like pin ball even a little bit...this game is really not for you.	-1
The Good: World War II movie clips are interesting, you can use cheat codes, new arsenal of weapons, fun opening level  The Bad: Wonky controls, terrible AI, boring gameplay, horrid framerate, ugly visuals, an overall lack of polish  Pearl Harbor was one of the worst terrorist attacks on the US, and was what got us involved in World War II. EA decided to leave the frontlines of Europe and head to Hawaii at Pearl Harbor and into the Japanese and Philippine frontlines. It's a nice change of scenery, especially back in the day when WWII shooters were coming out nearly every day. The problem is, Rising Sun is a reskin of Frontline with the lack of polish, detail, and just doesn't feel complete. Rising Sun needed about 6 months more of development before being anything remotely decent. What we have here is a sluggish, boring, and mediocre shooter, probably one of the worst shooters of 2003.  The game actually starts out pretty nicely. The bombing of Pearl Harbor feels epic in this game, you are just a nobody sailor who gets woken up by the bombings. After you see the poorly pre-rendered cut scene you start controlling your guy and it feels very similar to Frontline, too similar. Right off the bat you realize the control issues haven't changed. The aiming is really sensitive and finicky, there's no iron sights aiming, and the controls just suck still. Once you run around the boat trying to escape you notice you can save at checkpoints. This is actually one of the only two major issues that were fixed from Frontline. The missions are very long and you no longer have to start at the beginning of every level when you die.  Once you get out you notice the framerate is worse than Frontline. The FPS drops into single digits often and it actually affects gameplay. Trying to shoot someone when the game is chugging along at 5 frames a second is nearly impossible. It doesn't help that the aiming is already wonky. The change of pace in the beginning using the turret on the boat and shooting down planes is fun, I also have to mention that the only great part of Rising Sun is the music. Medal of Honor has a fantastic score across all the WWII games, but Rising Sun needs more than that to save it.  Once you start the next level you realize the game is just so bad. The level design is abysmal with confusing mazes, it was cute for EA to try to make you feel like you have multiple paths but you really don't. It just makes things more confusing. There are also secondary hidden objectives this time around but they are nearly impossible to figure out, hell even the regular objectives are hard to figure out. Items don't flash so you can't tel if it's part of the scenery or something you need to interact with. Most of the time you just get lucky when a prompt comes up on screen when you pass something.  I like the new selection of weapons, the shotgun, Type 99, Sten MKII, and a few other Pacific Theatre weapons. That's probably the only other great change from Frontline, but the guns control so horribly that you won't care. The most annoying part of Rising Sun is the forced and failed implementation of stealth. During one of the last few levels you get recruited into the OSS and have to infiltrate a Japanese summit at a hotel. The game gives you the Welrod which is a one shot silenced pistol. Sure that's fine, but Rising Sun wasn't built for stealth. I shot the first few people silently then all of a sudden I was being attacked. I had to run around the whole level with just a pistol and the Welrod. Not very fun. The hints say to stick to the shadows and stay in the column areas. Yeah sure what shadows? The stealth is just completely broken, but at least healing items give you more health so the game is a bit easier in that regard.  Let's finally talk about graphics, the game is butt ugly, even uglier than Frontline. During the jungle levels the devs just put a flat texture of a forest on the walls. Yeah good jobs you lazy jerks. The game is just ugly and is so unpolished. The events in the game are so unbelievable that it's hard to think that these things actually happened. Did I mention there's still no blood? The last thing to go is the terrible AI. The friendly AI just stands there while they're being shot and completely ignore enemies, the multiplayer is also as boring as ever.  Rising Sun sold millions of copies, but couldn't live up to the previous games quality. With ugly graphics, horrible framerate, terrible AI, bad level design and various other issues, Rising Sun stands as one of the worst games in the series.	-1
The Medal of Honor series has been popular for a long time.  After all, who doesn't like playing the same event (World War 2) 25 times?  Anyway though, "Rising Sun" is an example of how a company can get away with making trash, and still have it get decent reviews, and have it sell well.  "Rising Sun" is a horrid game, and is considered a letdown even to most Medal of Honor fans.  "Rising Sun" does absolutely nothing new, with a series that had already been around for years, upon years.  At the point of "Rising Sun" Medal of Honor was already considered an established series for Sony.  Anyway, when it comes down to it, Medal of Honor's "Rising Sun" game is a disappointment on all levels.  The gameplay is linear, and is often totally ridiculous, and the story is well.....nothing new either.  Only pick up "Rising Sun" if you want yet another horrid first person shooter, with nothing special in it.	-1
I bought this when it was first released for the PS2.  I had high expectations due to its predecessor, Medal of Honor Frontline.  This game was a huge disappointment to say the least.  You start out sleeping in a bunk below deck on a naval ship in Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese attack, and you need to get to the top of the ship and fight them off while you escape.  So, the beginning of this game is not too bad, and I was mildly interested in the gameplay.  Then things went downhill.  I can sum it up with one sentence:  Before I knew what was happening, I was done with the game.  Yes, that is right:  this game is so short it is not even worth the $ price tag.  I beat it in about 7 hours, and that includes taking bathroom breaks and eating meals.  Summary (out of 10)  Graphics: 5 Controls: 5 Story:  3 Gameplay: 2 Overall:  3  If you want a good military shooter, try Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor Frontline.  Medal of Honor Rising Sun is not worth the time it takes to get the shrinkwrap off.	-1
Nintendo's 1080 is a load of fun packed into one small package.  When you consider how limited the game is ultimately, you can't help but feel disappointed after only a few days of game play.  Nintendo could have really done something special with this game, and with the amount of time it took for the pioneer of video games (Nintendo) to release it, you'd think there'd be much more.  The graphics of 1080 are superb, and the controls are smooth and fantastic, but the characters and levels/stages seem grimly limited.  I loved playing this game.  I found myself begging for more.  The music element of 1080 was impressive, but that wasn't enough to make up for the lack of greatness it could have been. I'm dumbfounded by Nintendo's lack of effort towards 1080 and the overall product release.  If Nintendo was frustrated with the lack of sales this game produced, they should have given this game what it really deserved.  It deserved MORE.	-1
This game was a big disapointment. It was almost exactly the same as medal of honor frontline. The only difference was the levels, which were even more boring then frontline's levels. The storyline is so stupid that I skiped the in game movies. If EA wants to make a good and different war game than I suggest they make a war game about either the revolutionary war or the civil war. Theres too many games about world war 2 or about "special forces" games. These games have died out years ago, and there still making them!	-1
