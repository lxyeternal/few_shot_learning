This handcream has a beautiful fragrance. It doesnt stay on or protect your hands through washing.  This size is quite small.	1
wonderful hand lotion, for seriously dry skin, stays on a long time, a little goes a long long way.. go easy.. wonderful scent.. maybe a bit strong at first, but dissipates after a while.	1
Best hand cream around.  Silky, thick, soaks in all the way leaving hands super soft.	1
Thanks!!	1
Great hand lotion.  Soaks right in and leaves skin super soft.  No greasy residue, great scent!	1
Great product. Doesn't leave you hands feeling greasy or slippery.	1

Just as described. Arrived on time.	1
Nice lightweight hand cream for the summer.	1
Best hand cream ever.	1

BEST hand cream ever.  One at work, one in my purse, one on my nightstand, one in the kitchen.  Winter staple for me.	1
'Love this stuff.  Very smooth, very moisturizing.  Got it as a gift and reordered it as soon as it ran out!	1
I like the cream it's so beautiful	1
I LOVE this scent....  it's so refreshing and clean and yummy.  I don't know what fragrances are used for this Gardener's scent, but it is incredibly appealing, IMO and I doubt it would be perceived as offensive.  Rich & creamy as well.	1
The Best Hand Cream Ever, I love this product. Not greasy.	1
Amazing ....my favorite hand cream ever	1
My sons favorite hand cream for his dry hands. No greasy and absorbs well. I am a return buyer.	1
This hand cream is addicting and the scent is pleasant. It does not offend the senses and a little goes a long way.	1
I love this hand cream. I'm on my fifth tube. Love love love.	1
The best hand cream ever.  I'm constantly washing my hands, and this is the only hand cream that moisturizes without feeling greasy.	1
My son used some of this hand cream when I had it and is now a daily user and fan. I bought him some as a surprise. He has very dry and chapped hands. This cream or lotion seems to work and does not leave that greasy feel or smell to sweet. Good stuff!	1
This hand cream has one of the nicest fragrances I've ever come across and it seems to be one that everybody likes.  The cream is non greasy and absorbs quickly but leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized.  This is the of those products I buy over and over again and have for several years.  It also makes a nice gift in a basket with a pair of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Angela-s-Garden-7120-921-Kids-Garden-Glove-Honey-Bee/dp/B000P8DHQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Angela's Garden 7120-921 Kids Garden Glove, Honey Bee</a>, a hand gardening tool and a couple packets of seeds. The people I have given it to tell me that it's become one of their favorites too.  Everyone seems to like it's nice clean smell.	1
I'm SO glad I decided to try this toothpaste! Not only does it work, but it's so incredibly gentle! I seem to have become sensitive to whitening products, be it toothpaste or otherwise. They all either leave my gums raw, or cause tooth sensitivity. Not so with this toothpaste! My teeth have become blinding white since using. My dentist even asked me what I was using because the difference was so drastic (as I had hoped it would be!). I drink red wine, coffee, and I'm an ex-smoker. My teeth were getting a bit yellower as I neared 30 but they are finally white again and they are staying white!  The mint isn't too strong and doesn't make my eyes water either. Most toothpastes make my mouth feel like it's on fire, but this toothpaste does not.  My teeth look and feel great. This toothpaste gives my teeth that squeaky clean feeling and my dentist said my enamel doesn't look like it's taking a beating either which is a plus.  I couldn't recommend this toothpaste more. Skip the popular name brands and try this out. Yes, its more expensive, but a tube lasts me quite a long time and IT WORKS! The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.  I went a period without repurchasing when I needed to because my husband wanted to try charcoal. It did nothing except cause gum pain. Over the course of this time my teeth started to dull but after reordering this and using it just once, my teeth were already whiter again. Its been a few weeks and my teeth are blinding white again.  This is my HG toothpaste and I recommend it to all my friends and family as well. It's pretty amazing stuff.	1
I have been using this product for many years.  Although it is expensive, it is the only toothpaste I use.	1
I have been using this brand for a year now and my teeth are whiter. It is pricy. I prefer the cinnamon flavor. I have tried colgate and other name brands but they didn't whiten my teeth, even though they promised to do so.	1
A truly wonderful product for a mega watt smile. Works best with the accelerator .whitens my veneers too.my natural teeth match my veneers	1
Supersmile toothpaste is a low-foam toothpaste that has a soft abrasive that gently removes stubborn food stains from coffee, tea, berries and red wine.  There is no chemical burn or bad taste and is excellent for veneers and sensitive gums.  As a frequent traveler to countries where the water may not be safe to drink without boiling, beverages such as coffee and tea (instead of just plain water) are the norm in my diet and I had unattractive stains on my teeth no matter how hard or how often I brushed with regular toothpaste.  I hate the chemical taste  and burn of chemical whitening toothpastes so my dentist recommended Supersmile toothpaste as a way to help with the stains between visits.  By using Supersmile's toothpaste with an electric toothbrush at night before bed, I was able to remove most of the stains on my teeth and get them as naturally white as possible.  I love how the Supersmile accelerant is in a separate tube so I can choose when I need to use it in combination with the toothpaste (to get the inbetween teeth stains) to get my teeth beyond natural white (but not optical white).  To get the most out of this toothpaste, it needs to be used without water on an electric toothbrush for the full recommended 2-mins.  I use it mostly as an additional treatment with a dedicated toothbrush rather than as my primary toothpaste.	1
Best price around, beats the mall.	1
One of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome. I'm gifting this for my nephew.	1
Boyfriend loved it. I love it. He smells great. Can't keep my hands off him.	1
So happy I purchased this! Smells so good! Its the real thing.	1
Love it came fast to will buy more	1
EXCELENTE	1
Love......	1
I have sensitive skin and unfortunately have suffered painful reactions to certain brands of deodorant (mostly of the aluminum free or natural varieties from brands I otherwise like). I can't get enough of CK One and wanted to try this deodorant for a little while-so glad I did. Definitely the CK One fragrance I adore but a little lighter/ more subtle, no skin irritation, long lasting (most surprising) and I'm happy with the results and experience of wearing it. Smells fresh and clean which is what I want.	1
Great fragrance, not strong or over powering.  Received many compliments.	1
Very pleasant fragrance and last all day.	1
Subtle fragrance. Works well. It's hard to find a deodorant stick that doesn't leave underarms sticky. This is just perfect.	1
OK.	1
I'm hard pressed to think of something more subjective to review than cologne. It's just one of those things you won't know if you like until you try it yourself. That said, I personally like this cologne. It has a nice, pleasant aroma that is not overpowering like other fragrances. My wife also likes the way it smells on me. I just use one spray on my neck - two seemed to be a bit too much.	1
One has been around for a while and while I used to wear Calvin Klein, I wore a different scent than this one but I really loved it. I do like the light, citrus scent of One and its versatility. It can be unisex and it isn't heavy or over bearing. This scent can also be wore during any season and night or day. I like the freshness of the smell because I dislike heavy perfumes-they can give me a headache and make me sneeze. One is a classic that never goes out of style. The price is reasonable and the scent will last though out the day or evening.  I like the Aqua scent by Calvin Klein a bit more than One but I've been wearing them both and have gotten compliments on the fragrances.	1
I'm not one for scents or cologne, normally, however as the Vine Program offered this and it is billed for men or women, my wife and I decided to try it. The fragrance is clean and sophisticated but not overbearing and does indeed suit both men and women. Amazon's price is still a little steep, coming from someone not into frangrances, but there is enough here to last a goodly while.	1
This is one of the great modern classics.  I think every man (or woman apparently) should have a bottle of CK one in their arsenal.  Out of the 20 fragrances I own, CK One is probably top two with Aqua Di Gio Essenza.  Just a pleasing scent and one which some like but most will love.	1
Picked this up for my husband who was looking for a fresh new scent to try. I love how the citrus and wood tones smell on him. I put a little on my wrist and the scent changed more than I expected. This is truly an adaptable scent.	1
Calvin Klein ck one is a scent that I first tried about 15 years ago when I was a teenager. I loved the scent then and I still like it now. It is Unisex which means it can be used by Men as a cologne or by Women as a perfume. I tried it and so did my Husband. I personally liked it better on me. His cologne that he wears is a lot stronger and more masculine. The ck one fell a little flat in comparison. I do love it as a perfume though. It smells sweet on my skin and the violets, jasmine and Lilly scents really shine through.  The bottle that I received is 1.7oz. It is a decent size bottle that will last a long time...providing that you do not spill it. This comes to my one and only issue with this bottle. It has a screw on cap and no spray cap (like it shows in the picture). I am not sure if I received a box without the spray cap or if it just does not come with one. However, a spray top is necessary for me with fragrance. I have worn this 4-5 times already and I have already sloshed it all over my wrist once. Frankly, I am a klutz and this would be a pricey spill if I knocked the entire bottle over.  The 1.7oz is the most expensive size that you can buy (currently $28.82 per ounce). The 6.7oz bottle for the current price of $69 is a steal ($10.30 per ounce!). However, that is a lot of perfume. I would only recommend buying that size if you know that you or your gift recipient REALLY loves this perfume and will use it a lot. For me, this is an occasional perfume and the 1.7oz size will last me for years. The 1.7oz is big enough size wise to make a decent gift for a loved one. So, use your discretion and knowledge of the individual you are buying for when purchasing.  I would recommend this perfume. I just hope that my bottle only having a screw top was an error and everyone else receives a spray bottle as pictured.	1
If you're into unique, subtle scents, Calvin Klein's ck one is for you. It reminds me of unisex fragrances that had their heyday in the 90s. It's spicey, with the merest hint of a floral. I like it for myself, as a non-girly change of pace for my usual perfume of choice.  My husband likes it - but on me, not on him! We share everything, but we like smelling different!	1
I don't like using antiperspirants . . and this is deodorant only!  Great fragrance and very effective deodorant.  Hard to find except on Amazon.	1
About 20 years ago (ugh feeling old), this was THE perfume/cologne that the cool kids wore. I decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that I am. Everyone in their 30s & 40s recognizes the scent even if they don't know exactly that it's CK1. My only complaint is that it can give me a headache. Worth it.	1
I have a multitude of "designer deodorants" and while this has absolutely NO SCENT it caused a reaction on my skin. I've never had this issue with ANY deodorant before however I will never purchase this deodorant again.	-1
Love this.  Will never be without.	1
muy bueno	1
And quite simply, she does too. She recommended it, but I really do actually like it for myself. Its not overpowering like "I can't breathe let me out of this elevator RIGHT NOW" and its not too light like "I wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator". Its strong, bold and crisp.  And she really likes it. So there's no loss there EVER.	1
This scent is a pleasant flowery-sweet scent that I think is more for a man than a woman.  It is a modern classic in my opinion.  I doubt anyone would hate it.  You either like it or LOVE it.	1
Bought as a gift for my husband after he completely ran out of all cologne ( even the Old Spice standby!). Delivery was speedy and the package arrived well packed with the contents protected. He (and I) love the scent...and who doesn't feel better when you know you smell gooood !	1
Ordered this as a gift for a friend who is in love with this particular fragrance. She practically bathes in perfume so I had to get her the large version.	1
I haven't used any other deodorant product for several years, except for this Calvin Klein product.  I do not use a product with an antiperspirant in it because of the studies done on women regarding breast cancer, and this product does an absolutely perfect job!  I love the fragrance, the deodorant stick, and the packaging.  I have always purchased this product from Amazon, and I highly recommend it!	1
I couldn't believe I found this for such a good price. I was a little skeptical about buying cologne online but this made me a believer. My hubbie has had it for about 6 months now and it still smells great on him. It's not watered down at all and is a quality product at a reasonable price. I will be ordering more soon.	1
Love this color and brand	1
Was bought for a gift.  Recipient was thrilled.	1
looks great	1
Great color! Goes on in one coat, dries quickly, easy application brush.	1
This is the neutral I was searching for this winter. Tickle My France-y is a browned pink that works good with my skin tone and everything I wear. Professional but feminine. I use Poshe as my top coat and always get at least 7 days on a manicure.	1
Very bright color. Will be a great color for Easter!	1
I would give this zero stars. Formula is very watery. Something is not right with it. I will be returning. Very disappointed for an OPI product.	-1
This is a great soft while color I love it.	1
Love the color!	1
I guess I should have realized this would be yellow by having "chick" in the polish name. It didn't look that yellow on my phone. It's definitely yellow, not the neutral color I was expecting.	-1
Very light color. I'm pale and it matches my skin tone. It's subtle, but it's great fro everyday wear.	1
Chick Flick Cherry is a rich blue-red that makes me think of old movies and late nights in the summertime. This is the color of red I like to wear in the summertime with open-toed shoes.  It gives a little mystery, but flirty enough to say hello.  It is a versatile red that is perfect in the winter months as well.  I really like the darker, richer reds in the winter time as there is something comforting and cozy about the color.  If you are not one for blue-reds, this would not be the shade for you.  I put on one coat of polish and it is the perfect shade of red for me.  I don't think I would like it with a second coat.  I do love OPI products but this came with some of the bristles straight out to the side.  While they don't get in the way of polishing my nails, I do worry about product dripping off those stray bristles.	1
its ok	-1
Beautiful color!	1
I have already ordered this product as well as OPI's glittery silver, rust and gold sparkly nail polish.  The coverage is fantastic and I have found other sparkly clear coats to put over whatever color I'm using and that makes it even more glittery In the sun.  The product above and all the other OPI sparkly nail polish give terrific coverage with just two coats.  It is thick and sometimes I add a smidgeon of polish remover to make it less 'coarse' while preserving the fantastic color with a little more ease. I would definitely give a 'go' to the blue, rust, gold and silver sparkly colors  If you like glitter and you love sparkly you've gotta' try these products!! Sherrie H	1
I recently purchased this polish because I love glitter and I am a nut for blue. Glitter? Blue? How could I go wrong? I certainly did not with this polish. OPI Simmer and Shimmer is beautiful. It applies smoothly, dries fast and feels surprisingly smooth to the touch, even before topcoat. Application of topcoat just enhances the beautiful sparkle and scintillation of this glitter. It is long wearing, for a glitter, too. I wore this for four days with no chipping or tip wear. Love this polish!	1
Great color. Lasts longer than many other colors on my toe nails	1
It chip My wife nails in a day. If you have a nail gel nail dryer? Then stick with or go with the gel nail polish. It last longer than this stuff.	-1
Beautiful color for summer BUT is thick and does not cover well.  Color is actually a more red orange.  It does not hold up.	-1
Best nude for olive or light skin tones.  Easy to use formula that takes 3 coats for opaque but you can choose to wear sheer and it will still look beautiful.  A true skin color nude that doesn't dissapoint.  I wear it in its nail envy formula which helps keep my nails strong and grow quickly.  (Yes, it works)  no chipping, but I still use the original nail envy as base coat.	1
Haven't tried it yet.  Surprised at the "terra cotta" color from the outside of the bottle, I thought it would be more muted.  As soon as I use it, I will report more objectively.	1
Fast shipping and packaged well! I ordered the color  "Crawfishin for a Compliment"  and I absolutely love it!  My husband even noticed this new color on me  I've attached pictures with and without the flash on.	1
Gorgeous. Like Stevie Nicks and unicorns on my nails...	1
I normally don't leave reviews but the polish I received was too thick, difficult to apply and most definitely not the color advertised. Color is more of a peachy yellow than nude. I  love Opi polish but not satisfied with this one.	-1
Another great color from opi, girl friend loves it.	1
This blue something about it. It just catches the eye. Def a keeper	1
Great color. Love the way it looks.	1
Love this color! Great formula	1
Great	1
Honestly, I love this color. It is a coral color and is close to the picture provided. For better and smoother spread, I highly recommend rolling and shaking the bottle. For optimal color, I recommend applying a single layer first then apply a fuller second layer. The coral color pops and is extremely juicy! This is a perfect mid summer or early fall color but can be used in an ombre for the fall.	1
Perfect for my toe nails.	1
Love this polish	1
Nice color for fall	1
Very nice summer polish!	1
Pretty color!	1
Perfect!	1
Part of the new 2016 summer colors. Another great nude for a fast, fresh home manicure. Love it.	1
Such a gorgeous blue ! My clients love it	1
More bubblegum pink than expected, but still a nice, bright mod pink. I received compliments from my coworkers, too.	1
Pretty color but sheer. 3 coats to build up.	1
OPI New Orleans Spring/Summer nail polish is good....Fun shades!	1
This is a beautiful shimmer periwinkle that leans a tad more blue. The formula is a bit watery compared to the other OPI colors, but still OPI level quality. It is really sheer on the first coat so it could be used as a nice topper. It still builds up nicely despite this. You need 3 coats for full opacity, and you can get away with 2 coats if you don't care much about seeing bits of your nails still. There are no issues with brush strokes or pooling either. It is also definitely a hard to find color in stores so I would really recommend and stocking up if you like this color. Overall, I definitely fell in love with this color and I can't stop staring at my nails lol.	1
This color will cheer you up! It's very unique and the name will make you smile (especially if you're from NOLA) It pops and makes your toes fun. I don't suggest more than two thinnish coats...otherwise, it doesn't look as adorable.	1
This review is for Russian Navy. Nice color, but when you remove it, it's a real mess, it makes it look like you have dirty hands and nails, the stuff gets under your nails and you have a big mess, discolors your natural nails too. Awful! I have it away from my other polishes to be sure I don't use it again. I had to refile my nails and tried very hard to get the staining off, I wanted to cry. I use a base coat too so this isn't the case. I love opi, but they can keep this, not sure what there doing, I hope it's just this color and they haven't changed the formula, I do not recommend this unless you want dirty looking nails and hands upon removal	-1
Love the color.	1
Such a pretty and light color	1
Love this color!	1
Beautiful Color for summer. I used two coats and a top coat and it looks amazing! Not streaky or watery more creamy. Very good coverage.	1
It's a beautiful color.	1
I agree with other reviewer it's not as bright as I had pictured this to be. Still I will wear once I get a tan .I think the color will stand out more. Mine looks on the peach side some say pink but I didn't see that.	1
Best colors in a long time.	1
Love, love, love! Gorgeous color, lasts forever and get constant compliments...best buy ever!!!	1
Pretty purple. If you like color, you'll like this.	1

I'm wearing it right now.  Great color and wears like iron.	1
I am not much of a glitter or sparkle gal, but this one is truly, a gem. It looks like gems come to think of it!  I layer it on as an accent nail ; using a pale color for the first coat, layers of Servin' Up Sparkle  two layers of top coat. The result looks like diamonds encased in glass. It's a wow kind of effect .  This may be the only glitter coat I use, but it love it, and I hope that OPI will not discontinue it!	1
This is perhaps my favorite OPI polish. It is made up of  halogen dots sprinkled all over a base coat which is mostly clear and like most of OPI sparkly polishes it can be worn over  any other polish (as a topcoat) or several coats all on it's on. I use it all over the place; mix it with other sparkly polishes or over a pearlalized  product but however you use it you will love it and I guarantee that---just don't buy to many 'cause I'm coming back for more!!!!	1
I had another bottle of this shade from a couple of years ago, and this shade was not exactly the same.	1
My standard color, a great red.	1
Got it for My Wife. Nevertheless she said her nails chip within a day of applying it. She will just stick with gel nail polish instead.	-1
Love this color and brand	1
Beautiful color, easy formula, with 2 coats for full opaqueness, and as a bonus, NO STAINING! Unfortunately it chipped after a day, but it's not a big deal for me since I change polish often enough. Ultimately, if I had a mainstream brand next to an indie, I'll buy the indie.  I only buy OPI or CG when on sale.  I'm happy with this purchase @ $5.50 but if it were $10, I'd buy me an indie instead.	1
This is a really beautiful color.  This is my favorite brand of polish!  Love this one - and they are always coming out with new ones!	1
GREAT color	1
Nice color, looks great will definitely recommend	1
I bought Danke-Shiny Red and it's an incredibly gorgeous ruby red shimmer. It is opaque in 1 coat, but the color does deepen slightly with a 2nd coat. You can definitely get away with it in 1, but I'm usually a 2-coat girl and prefer the color being a bit deeper so I use 2 coats. It also dries very shiny. The formula is great in that it's not too thick or thin, glides on the nail easily, doesn't pool, and isn't prone to any brush strokes. It also levels out quite nicely. I haven't had any major chipping concerns, but I do use Seche Vite top coat. Only con is that it's rather messy to remove and can stain a bit, but it's so beautiful that it's worth it. This is one of the few polishes that I always get compliments on. It's one of those polishes that catch the eye. Definitely my #1 holy grail red. If anything, I can probably say it's my favorite polish in my collection.	1
Love the color, perfect for summer and keeping it professional and neutral for work!	1
Don't get the hype surrounding this brand of nail polish. I put it on my toes and it didn't last three days before showing signs of wear and chips. I usually use a drugstore brand that is a 3rd of the price (cheaper), and that stuff stays put. This is just overpriced and not very durable.	-1
True to color. I was afraid it would be some mustard yellow, but it's a very "daisy" sort of yellow.	1
THE MOST AMAZING COLOR EVER! This is a soft pink with subtle glimmer, just classy and elegant.	1
After much deliberation and a lot of wine, I decided to go ahead and buy I Vant to Ne A-Lone Star and happily put it on my nails when it arrived. I was impressed with the color, an opaque light gray with a slight pearl to the finish, but it seems a little weaker than the solid gray that we see in the photos. I wore it for about three days before I decided I wanted something a little flashier.  As far as low-key colors go, it's good for work, play and about anything else. Survives dishwashing well, but the opacity of the color leaves a little bit to be desired. Unlike other OPI polishes, this is streaky on the first application and okay on the second...it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails.  Overall, the color is good. I like it better than a comparable polish (I think Recycle) by Essie, has no brown undertones, and is good for all skin tones. However, it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes. Where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle, the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak, and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly, even with a good topcoat. I think this is why the nails look shorter.	1
Pretty color!  Love OPI	1
rich and beautiful color	1
This color is so pretty, even on my skin tone, which is super duper pale. Be aware though: It takes like 5 coats to get a really opaque look.	1
OPI is always a great quality product.	1
Opi	1
Fast shipping and in perfect condition!  Love OPI nail products  I'm not real crazy about the color I ordered. Color is called "Passion". I am medium skin tone and I just found this pink to be too pink and not flattering with my skin tone. I think this color would fare best on lighter and deeper skin tones.	1
I used a Revlon color called Putty years ago and I have looked and looked for a similar color. I finally found it in the OPI Tickle My France-y. The color looks great on short nails but looks very stylish on long or short. I am using all OPI products and I can wear the nail polish without chips for a week without any problems.  OPI is a little prciey but it is well worth it.	1
OPI has the most vibrant and long-lasting colors. This raspberry shade is very flattering and always gets compliments.	1
My very favorite color for summer!!! OPI is the best polish anywhere! It lasts for weeks without chipping and usually covers in just one coat! Great company and product!	1
Exactly as described.  Sure wish I could find OPI's "Start To Finish."  Can't find it anywhere.	1
The more OPI polishes I buy, the more I'm convinced it's the best brand available. (I also like Revlon, which has similarly smooth formulas with good coverage and a large selection of colors.) I've never had an OPI polish streak, clump, or lose "hairs" from the brushes (like with other polish brands), and the colors are rich and gorgeous.  This polish is my new favorite neutral. It's opaque and matte, with just the usual nail polish shine, but no shimmer or glitter. The color is a nice rosy mauve that's somewhere between pink and brown. It's a good year-round color for my pale, olive-toned skin, and I can imagine it might be flattering on many skin tones. I had hoped it might be slightly more purple, but although there seems to be a lavender undertone the overall color is more pink/mauve.	1
Very bright and super fun for summer.	1
This is my go-to color when I'm in a rush to paint my nails.  Very pretty and simple especially if you put a sheer white as your base color.	1
Really simple and pretty with a top coat	1
Though the image looks pink/purple, this color would be appropriately labeled as a "nude" nail polish. I love this color and it looks fantastic either shiny or matte. I bought this bottle to replace one that I used up because it is such a pretty nude color.	1
Very nice color!	1

very soft, natural color. ideal for at home . long lasting, non-chipping. excellent product.	1
Great color, applies easily but does not last as long as gel as advertised. Removes easily with polish remover.	1
I love OPI polish. Never have complaints there. This polish has more of a mauve tone to it.	1
Not my favorite color, but lasted long on my nails. Looks a little more orange in person.	1
Beautiful, long lasting color. What more can we ask for? My very favorite color.	1
This is actually the first OPI nail polish I own, can't complain the quality or the color.  Green isn't the usual color I go for, but this was a beautiful green, first coat and second coat both looked lovely.	1
Beautiful, long lasting color. What more can we ask for?	1
Love the color and ease of application	1
Beautiful shade,  I really like it.  It's very fancy or for any day.	1
Fantastic color. I really like the skin tone chart...big help!	1
This is a gorgeous color.  Almost a neutral that will complement many outfits.  Goes on prettily.  Two or three coats. I use a base and top coat.  I have yet to find a nail polish that completely delivers on longevity, but this one OPI shade is better than most. Top coat each day and repair and remove polish on any nail that looks off.	1
Love purple polish	1
Great color!!	1
Big apple red is THE BEST real red nail polish I've ever been able to find, Its long lasting and stays on well. OPI is my favorite polish. A lot of the red have too much orange or pink and aren't bright enough this is a classic red perfect for a night out or even everyday use!	1
Obsessed with this sky blue color!  Looks great on a variety of skin tones and perfect for the spring/summer.	1
the color was a little darker and less red than I expected but still a great polish!!	1
I love anything OPI and this was definitely up to par!!	1
Pretty color and much to m surprise it stayed on really well - in fact it was harder to get off than regular nail polish.  Bright and pretty.	1
Love this color. Sheer stylish, love!	1
This polish won't come off once applied, and it looks exactly as pictured. My only qualm with the product is that it is pretty thick when you're applying a coat.	1
Nice color of pink. True to color on web site. Lasted a long time without chipping after pedicure.	1
Nice summer color	1
I love the OPI  infinite shine.  I ordered the color "you can count on it"  and it is a perfect nude shade. I absolutely love it  I've included a picture with and without the flash for reference.	1
Great	1
Great color, one of my all time favorites. Of course I only buy OPI. Color is same as picture which isn't always the case.	1
Basically a white ish nude ish color, and good shine,. I love OPI it stays on without chipping longer. And the colors are great	1
OPI IS ALL I WEAR	1
This is a gorgeous pastel pink color! The only down fall to this color is it required 3 coats to get an even application. Other than that, this color is gorgeous and perfect for when you're not sure what color to paint your nails!	1
Beautiful neutral toned nail polish with superior shine. I use it with Nail Envy and Seche.	1
Chipped the next day. Don't waste your money	-1
I love OPI's Cajun Shrimp color! It's the perfect coral-red mixture. A great summertime color! OPI has had this color out for years and there's a reason. Whenever I do an at-home pedi, the polish chips quicker than it does when I got get a professional pedi - it can last for weeks then!	1
awesome	1
One of my favorite colors. Even though it's not one of those iridescent colors that is made to change colors, it looks pink in some light a s coral in others. Not too baby pastel light, and not too dark.  Just right.	1
Love this color, natural and elegant. OPI is great nail polish and this is my go-to color.	1

Really pretty color, but not good for a yellower skin-tone. Gave it to my mom who is more of a pink skin tone. Very blue undertones	1
Pretty color, translucent and shimmery.  I use it over 2 coats of Essie Mademoiselle for a fresh, clean, almost-French  manicure look.	1
Polish chips within a day or two.	-1
Nice quick drying top coat	1
I bought Bee Mine Forever, put it on for the first time today. This polish is a darker yellow than it looks to be on the listing, which, ok, that happens, but it's just really terrible overall. The consistency is such that the first coat is streaky, and the second coat does not help, the streaks beneath are still visible. I have had it on for just a few hours now, having used the OPI base and top coat for this line, and it has chipped already even though I have done nothing chip-worthy. This line of polish is really hit-or-miss with color, consistency, and durability and I would say this one is a major loser. Also do not recommend the silver or Beyond the Pale Pink.	-1
Works well!	1
Nice nude color. Easy to apply for a fast home manicure.	1
Fun shade and opi is always the best.	1
It works as expected.	1
I came across this color and had to order it for the Holidays. This looks just like the picture but even better in person. You can wear this alone or over another color ,which right now I am. I am wearing this over a  OPI purple color and was so easy to apply. I only needed one coat instead of two like most polishes with glitter. I normally don't wear glitter polishes because they are a pain most I have used were always to thick or runny. This one was not a problem at all. So far it's holding up good ,no chipping. I used a top coat as well. Looks so pretty and really stands out. This definitely exceeded my expectations.	1
Gorgeous color!	1
I just bought this color and tried Infinite Shine for the first time. I am blown away! I had to come and leave a review.  Pros: it's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate. It's INCREDIBLY shiny- I have been doing my own gel nails at home with a gel light for years and this polish looks the exact same as when I do my nails in gel. It dries fast; I painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it's totally dry. I also love the color. It looks a lot like You Dont Know Jacques.  Cons: None yet! I will check back in to see if it truly lasts the 7-10 days as advertised.  Update 11/1/15- Sadly, the product does not last that long. I've tried two separate colors and it only lasts about 3 days before it starts to chip. Definitely better than a "regular" top coat, not nearly as good as my gel nails at home.	1
Great color. Natural and fresh	1
Love OPI nail polish. This color did not work out for me. I was hoping for a sheer peachy pink.  I have tried applying it several times, with lots of shaking to blend.  Every time I got a streaky look unless I applied enough coats to create an opaque look, which was then a bit too white and bright to flatter my pale skin tone.	-1
Great color	1
The color on this is amazing. I like the shade.  Like others, I did have some bubbling the first time I applied. You have to do very thin coats to avoid this.  The lasting power is pretty good. I seem to chip my right pointer finger no matter what except for when I had a pro apply this. I'll change this to a five-star review if I can get that finger to last more than 2 days.	1

I dispute the claim of being super shiny. These polishes are no more shiny than any other. Don't buy the hype. OPI I expect more of them.	-1
Rivals my favorite CND Vinylux. I don't use the OPI top coat. I do use the vinylux top coat and a CND sticky base with this polish and it lasts well over 7 days. I'm a nurse and I'm always using my hands and still no chips and super shiny.	1
OPI is always great! This is too.	1
OPI color lasts a long time and I enjoy the variety and colors along with the names.  I thought their top coat it would be the same quality, but was surprised at the poor quality.  For me, I tried it about three different times and where other brands leave a high quality finish, this OPI product does not.	-1
Great color, bright, easily removed with acetone.	1
nice bright color.  a little more difficult to apply to due lightness of color	1
One of the best top coats out there! Dries fast and protects your manicure from chipping.	1
great stuff	1
I had such high hopes for OPI's Infinite Shine, but it is just not a good product. I ordered the primer and top coat, plus two colors--You Can Count on It and Can't Be Beet!. The consistency of the pink, You Can Count on It, was awful--streaky and gloppy; it left brush marks that refused to smooth out after application. I let the first coat dry very well before applying the second coat, but it, too, left brush marks. Can't Be Beet, a dark, rich red, was better, but not great. The pink (primer, 2 ccolor coats, and a top coat, began chipping the very next day. What a disappointment! I will stick to OPI Gelcolor.	-1

Very nice white polish. It's a little streaky, but I could have just gotten a mediocre batch.	1
Great for sunset nail designs!	1
It's a perfect color for sunset nail designs!	1
great product!	1
Great top coat. I use this along with the base coat from this brand and my polish lasts much long. Was having issues with my polish chipping before I tried using it.	1
People love this color! It is a bit more orange/coral than pictured. Very tropical!	1
This polish has so many different shades in it--fuschia, coral, blue.  It changes in every different light, and flatters different skin tones. It wears very well. And I love OPI polish.  Buying a refill.  Don't want to run out!	1
i got don't bossa nova me around. more purple than i would like for a nude but still a pretty color	1
I have bought a huge amount of OPI Nail polish and Sparklelicious was quite a bit more costly than the norm but it is beautiful.  I mix a lot of sparkly polishes to get the most bling out of them and this item has the bling and the sparkle and I am, though not happy at the price, terrifically happy with the product. I have just purchased my THIRD bottle because I want to have 'back-up' in the event this is discontinued.  This is my favorite of them all (and I've bought a huge amount of polishes from Amazon) and anyone that gives this less than FIVE stars must not like bling; 'cause this is truly gorgeous! Thanks Sherrie H.	1
Great color	1
I got the Little Teasers set and have now used three of the four colors that came in it. "Rising Star" is a thin-applying, coppery orange with glitter so small it appears as shine. The color, like most OPI, goes on easy, but I did decide to use three coats instead of two to get the desired intensity. It is not a pigment intense color. It is, however, quite striking and even though I got a lot of "that's orange, Kat" I also got a lot of "it looks really good" along with it, often from the same people. Men seem to like this color; women are also intrigued. Seeing as how it is autumn right now, this is a good color to wear. It is not too bright or shocking, so it is good to wear with any color; as your fingers turn the shine really kicks in.  I would recommend this for any time of year. I will probably not buy a regular-sized bottle of this, but I will definitely use up the tiny bottle that I have now and wear it with delight.  And if you have henna in your hair (as I do) it matches beautifully.	1
Beautiful color. Looks purple in the bottle, but is a navy blue... Love it!	1
Gorgeous color and the classic OPI formula.  Wore it on my toes chip-free for 2 weeks!	1
Color is a tad darker than I expected, but still nice a bright.  Glides on easily and doesn't chip excessively.	1
Love OPI.	1
Goes on smoothly, and lasts	1
The best way to keep it from chipping, or peeling off, is first use mild polish remover on nails to get any oil or dirt off (I have also been told to rough up the nails abit every other week (use a buff bar and use the even out side but do not push hard or do for to long.). After I use the remover and let the nails dry, I use a good base coat, one that helps hold the polish.  I let the base dry for 10 min's or so, then put on 1 THIN coat and let it dry 20min's or more then Put on JJa second Thin coat of the polish. After 20+ min's I put on a good top coat, which protects the polish, gives a nice shine and takes away that sand paper feel. You need to put on thiner coats and let it dry longer between coats when using glitter polish.  Also it helps to use 100% acetone remover, got mine at Walmart, to make it easer then reg or even normal acetone polish remover. Also, you can use a thin coat of colored polish after the base coat and under the glitter to give a little more depth.  With this glitter you can use almost any shade.  Such as bronze, red, blue , purple, etc.  Use light, dark or anything in-between. Sapora for OPI also makes some nice glitters.	1
Love the color	1
Love it	1
This polish is gorgeous. It is a beautiful pink duochrome that shifts to orange. It is packed with pink, orange and blue shimmer that dances and shifts and scintillates in the sun. This polish is a tad sheer, I need three coats but it applies so beautifully that it is no problem to apply them. Love, love, love this polish.	1
I love this polish! It is so sparkly and fun. It applies very easily and is surprisingly smooth. It dries quickly and lasts nicely for a glitter.  I *heart* OPI.	1
Opi makes the best nail polish by far and there colors are always beautiful and come out with a solid shiny vibrant finish.	1

Almost the perfect skin shade.  Lovely.	1
Pretty good color. After two coats it is as pictured.	1
Love this color!	1
very good	1
I have a professional manicure once a month. In between times, I do my own nails. My nails are well conditioned and the professional manicure keeps my nails in top notch condition.  I noticed years ago that my manicurist always applied a base coat that acts as a layer to receive the nail color I want. Some base layers are glossy, I prefer those that are not. This Opi base is perfect. I start by applying  one coat to my left hand and then by the time my right hand is done, the left is ready for the nail color. The base is a necessity for me, and keeps my manicure you'd for at least a week. I usually use only Opi and Essie products, so I do know that I am using quality products.  Recommended. prisrob 10-03-13	1

Another gorgeous color from OPI. Beautiful dark green/teal!	1
This is my new favorite color. It is gorgeous! It's a dark purplish bluish color. Just what I was looking for!	1
Loveliest color I've ever owned!	1
perfect spring pink	1
Great nude pink shade. Definitely for daily wear.	1
I ordered Don't Bossa Nova Me Around. It's not the color I was expecting - in yellow light it's a creamy brown and in bright light it almost has a lilac tint to it. However, application was flawless. Totally opaque and beautiful with a single coat.	1
This is a really hard product to find.  The nail salons are always out of it because everyone loves it...  I was SO surprised to find it on Amazon - and REALLY happy!  This is the only Ridge Filler that I have ever loved.... of course, you can never go wrong with OPI!	1
this color is BEAUTIFUL!!!! i love it!!	1
What a difference this product makes. I honestly didn't think I needed it... but I am so pleased with the way it makes my nail polish look.	1
Love this color! Chips faster than previous bottles but still love it!	1
great color	1
repeat purchase	1
I've used Seche-vite, Jordana and Out the door top coats and this one is the worst of all. Slow drying and no shine at all. No point of using this for top coat! Will never buy this one.	-1
My favorite! Love this polish. Although this specific bottle seems to chip quicker than my previous bottles of the same color.	1
I like this top coat, it keeps nail polish clear and rhinestones in place. It's easy to spread to make a thin coat.	1
This is so so pretty. I don't tend to like purples on my nails, however this makes me change my mind. Gorgeous color and the formuler is great!	1
I got my nails painted this color at my local nail spa and loved it so much I ordered it! I put it on my nails the day it came in the mail and was wonderful as expected! Came super fast and was super affordable for such a great quality brand and how large the bottle is and the bottle came very full.	1
I like all O.P.I. products thus far with the exception of the Matte finish. The Quick Dry Top coat by O.P.I. is better.	1
This really does fill in the ridges although I have pretty smooth nails. It is more for my toenails which seem to be less smooth than my fingernails. I like all O.P.I. products thus far with the exception of the Matte finish.	1
Great nail polish, one of my favourite classic colors, but delivery to CA took about 3 weeks!	1
I  feel pretty confident of my ability to put top coat on my nails.  But for whatever reason this polish bubbles up on my nails.  I was looking for so much more in this product.	-1
This wasn't the color I wanted from the POTC collection, but somehow I ended up buying it anyway. I chose this over a lilac by Essie, which was more along the lines of what I was actually looking for. While I do like some shades of the purple family, I'm not huge on purple-purple in general. I took a chance thinking it might be a fun color, though I was really expecting to dislike it. It is a bright color, but not nearly as overwhelming as some purples out there. It worked well with my skin color, I figure because it has more blue than red. I guess it turned out to be the super purple polish for the non-fan of purple. =-)	1
thanks so much!	1

Face it - if you can't build a set of nails with ENVY, you probably aren't intended to wear nail polish.  This stuff works.  I started using this ten years ago and paid full-price.  When I found it here, on Amazon, all my troubles faded to black.  Sometimes - I admit - I stray from this terrific product and return to "Hard as Nails" - trying to fool myself into ignorant complacency.  Then - my nails grow.  And I begin to suffer again.  Keep it up with ENVY, girls - and you'll never be sorry.  You'll be the one everyone else envies.	1
I pay about $16 or $17 dollars for this stuff in the stores. So, the online price is fantastic. This is a staple product for me. It works. It does what it says. After I've finished the bottle, I can go about a month or two without it. Typically, I might apply the second bottle only once per week or so, giving my nails little breaks in between before repeating the process. OPI makes a follow up treatment for this product, used for maintenance, but I haven't tried it yet since it's harder to find in my area. I know the price seems a little expensive to some, but, for me, it's worth every penny.  I've been using this product for about 2 years. After you've stopped using this product for 2 months or so, your nails go back to normal. I've always had long nails, but after my second pregnancy my nails would break very easily. I tried gel overlays over my natural nails for awhile, but that process actually destroyed my natural nails. I cut them off, let them grow out, and have been using Nail Envy ever since.  Nail Envy seems to make the nail a bit thicker. I still break nails from time to time (especially if they're getting TOO long), but no where near as often as I do without this product.  A hair stylist recommended that I forget about the gel and try this product. I had very little hope that it measured up to all the hype, but (obviously) I was pleasantly surprised. Nail Envy does not work instantly. When you're just starting out (or starting over) with Nail Envy, you  have to use this product as directed for at least 2 weeks before you see a difference. I have recommended this product to other people who did not follow the instructions, and they did not get the results. For the first week and a half or so, your nails may still break and do whatever it is that they typically do. Just give it time. Use as directed, and you will be very happy with the results! (Be *sure* to cut/file/buff out any splits in your nails. Nail Envy will not repair or mend damage that has already occurred to the nail.)	1
I have light skin with some imperfections. As I age, I find that my skin tone is uneven, and I have capillaries that are visible as well as some dark spots on my face. I wasn't quite sure how this product would work for me.  It comes with a spatula, but instead I moistened my fingertips and applied it as I would my normal foundation. I was quite surprised and impressed by the coverage as I blended it. Since it comes hardened in the jar it was not as easy to apply as a liquid is, but warming it with the fingers seemed to help the spread. I dotted it and blended on my brown spots and it didn't seem to cake but looked fairly natural. I was very pleased with the outcome.  So why only 4 stars -- well, the truth is that the hard product in the jar isn't that easy to use. I didn't use the "scoop" and just twirled my fingers in the jar. It would be easy to overdo this. It is essential to get the right color for your skin and there is a handy chart on the website to use. I was thinking that a sponge might help with application, but I find that those just waste a lot of product. I also use a powder to set it. It is definitely thicker than my usual make-up and it's important to apply thinkly to avoid the "caked-on" look.  Overall, I do like the foundation and I will keep using it. No hypersensitvity reaction nor increase in blemishes noted.	1
My wife likes the smoothness of the product as it makes it easy to apply. What she loves about it is that is has the SPF 30 feature which she finds most products having only SPF 15.	1
I've been pleased with Dermablend products all in all, but for some reason I found this one looks un-natural.  It gave my skin a mask like look. It just didn't suit me at all. I'm not sure if it's just a reaction with my own skin chemistry or if other people also find this product looking very artificial after application.  Again, I am usually satisfied with Dermablend makeup, this was my one exception.	-1
Great coverage, hides all my flaws	1
This is a nice foundation that blends easily with a good brush. It blends into my skin well and doesn't have a heavy feeling. I don't wear makeup all that often, but when I do use this foundation, I feel good about it. It doesn't look or feel like I'm wearing a mask over my real face. It washes off easily and didn't cause any skin irritation or outbreaks.	1
Works great. Nice color. Does what it is supposed to do. Long lasting.	1
I use a primer before applying and then I use a round buffer foundation brush to apply. I swirl the brush in the Dermablend and then buff it onto my face. I finish applying my make-up and then set with Make Up For Ever HD setting powder and it stays until I wash my face without budging. I haven't tried the Dermablend setting powder but I am sure it is similar. I use NARS tinted moisturizer for more sheer coverage and the Dermablend for my full-on days :) Love it	1
As an AA woman this blends and cover very well.  I have a significant birthmark on my face and Dermablend covers it completely without flaking, caking, and rubbing off on my clothes.	1
Dermablend products are simply amazing!  I have a bunch of dark spots (Southern California teenager) and this covered them right up.  The color is a little darker than I expected, and matches when I have a tan (which is nearly never).  If you are looking for long-lasting matte coverage, this is the BEST!  I have used the Dermablend sticks to cover my tattoo, too.  This brand is totally different from the traditional makeup you see--even at Sephora or Ulta.  They are heavier, provide more coverage, and they last all day.	1
Very nice full coverage foundation, conceals my freckles and other blemishes well and stays on all day. Recommended.	1
Easy to apply and has really good coverage, I also like the fact that it doesn't need to be constantly reapplied.	1
Dermablend Cover Creme is easy to apply with nothing more than a fingertip. It applies smoothly and easily, blending dark and light spots away quickly and effectively. The cover creme does not irritate my mildly sensitive skin, and even though I have excessively oily skin, Dermablend stays on all day long without any need to touch up or reapply the product. The coloring is as advertised and there is enough pigment in the product so that only one layer of application is needed for full cover of unwanted spots. I am very happy with how well this product works, and the fact that a little bit goes a long way is a huge plus.	1
The foundation in the Vine list was too dark for me, but I still liked it as far as the way it applied, lasted, and sun protection and was glad for the chance to try it!  I wore it around the house when I did not have to go anywhere.  I have sensitive skin but the foundation did not cause any break outs or other irritation.  It govered the imperfections in my skin very well.  Because of the darker shade I may not be able to evaluate the coverage as well, but I liked it well enough that I may get a shade that matches me.	1
I'm happy with this. It has good coverage and matches my fair skin well. I apply it with a beauty blender and then blend with a foundation brush. I have sensitive skin and have not noticed any irritation. A little goes a LONG way.	1
Before this product, I was already a big dermablend fan, having used a variety of items from this brand.  My skin tone is uneven and I am a senior citizen still suffering from acne.  Dermabland cosmetics are designed for skin like mine, because they really conceal imperfections and even out tone.  I find that this full coverage cover creme is the ultimate product for achieving the look of complete uniformity in facial skin color.  This product is heavier than other choices, and I use it in combination with, and under, liquid foundation and then face powder (also both dermablend).  Despite this being a pretty intense trio of facial products, the end result looks natural while totally covering my most unnatural and varied actual skin tones.  I also should note that neither this product, nor any other dermablend choices, ever seems to aggravate my problem skin.  So, you get your problems covered up and not made worse at the same time.	1
This is a quality product that does an excellent job covering blemishes and evening out the skin. It's a little heavy for my personal preference during daytime use, but I like it for nighttime as it looks more natural away from harsh sunlight, at least on my fair skin. Otherwise, a very good product that does exactly as promised.	1
I started out not liking this product at all.  After a few applications I have fallen in love with it.  I tend to get a much better coverage with this than the liquid foundation I was using and the color is spot on.  It has even helped to cover up some of the redness in my skin tone.  This is definitely a keeper, and a product that I will purchase again, make up tends to last me a very long time!  To apply, I just rub my fingers over the powder to 'warm and soften' it, I find this much easier than using the little spatula that was included.  I suppose this is not the clean way of applying the foundation, but it works for me and my face has not broken out in a rash of acne or fallen off, so I will continue to ignore the little spatula, which always gets lost anyway!	1
Medium/full coverage foundations can be tricky.  It's hard to find that balance between covering up any imperfections without makeup looking cakey or unnatural.  This foundation from Dermablend impressed me because it strikes that balance.  It's great for covering blemishes or other imperfections.  I applied it using the directions on Dermablend's website.  The suggest starting with a small amount of product, warming it up with your fingertips to make the product more bendable, and then tapping it directly over your imperfections.  They state you can use multiple layers by allowing one layer to dry and applying more, but thankfully one layer has been perfect for me.  Then you finish things off by applying setting powder, allow to set for 2 minutes then brush off excess powder with a brush.  Dermablend makes its own setting powder but I don't own it so I've been setting my makeup with Laura Mercier and Hourglass's powders instead, and have liked the results with both.  I still think I prefer lighter coverage for everyday wear, especially since I'm in my 30's and self-conscious about not accentuating fine lines or dryness.  But I really like this for nights out when I tend to wear bolder makeup.  It compliments a bold lip or smokey eye well.  Would recommend.	1

Then you finish things off by applying setting powder, allow to set for 2 minutes then brush off excess powder with a brush.  Dermablend makes its own setting powder but I don't own it so I've been setting my makeup with Laura Mercier and Hourglass's powders instead, and have liked the results with both.  I still think I prefer lighter coverage for everyday wear, especially since I'm in my 30's and self-conscious about not accentuating fine lines or dryness.  But I really like this for nights out when I tend to wear bolder makeup.  It compliments a bold lip or smokey eye well.  Would recommend.	1
This was a little darker then I was expecting but I was able to use it and I love how well it hides the blemishes and imperfections.  I don't use a lot of makeup because it is hard to find ones that do not irritate my skin.  This creme has been great so far, and I have not had any redness or irritation.	1
This review will be done from the perspective of a makeup artist.  I am going to explain how I find it is best to apply and use this foundation based upon the formula, and then how I think that this performs compared to other products that I have used over time.  WHAT IS THIS FOUNDATION LIKE? First of all, this is a very thick creme foundation.  This type of foundation is different in performance and application than lotion, powder, or mineral foundation.  More on that later.  The foundation comes in a clear jar with cap on it.  There is no scent,, and it is highly pigmented.  COLOR? I have compared this to a few colors I have access to at the moment and can tell you this color, medium beige Chroma 2 1/2 is: -Similar lightness to Bare Escentuals medium beige, but BE is quite a bit yellower base -Lighter by two shades from MAC NW25 Studio Tech formula which is similar to this.  It is the same tone range, however.  This color has a more pink base to it, but is not so pink that it looks strange like some foundations.  This is more suitable for cooler complexions, but not limited to.  HOW TO APPLY First of all, make sure that your face is moisturized after cleaning it.  Good moisturizing is key.  You can use a primer, if you like.  I happen to really like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Natasha-Denona-Face-Glow-Primer-Hydrating-Underbase-1-01-oz-30-mL/dp/B01MQJMK21/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Natasha Denona Face Glow Primer Hydrating Underbase 1.01 oz/ 30 mL</a>&nbsp;for drier skin and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Swanson-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serum-1-fl-oz-29-6-ml-Serum/dp/B008PPXBA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Swanson Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1 fl oz (29.6 ml) Serum</a>&nbsp;for more oily or normal and  younger skin.  The way to apply this foundation is to take the jar, open it up and get yourself a Beauty Blender.  I prefer to stay with the name brand as I have tried many substitutes and still go back to the Beauty Blender for the best performance.  Wet and squeeze out the beauty blender, so it is damp.  Then dab the beauty blender into the Dermablend and just get a small amount on the surface so that it looks like there is not much at all on there.  Choose a quarter of your face area and begin to bounce the sponge all around that area.  It will look like you are not doing much of anything.  Trust me, you are.  For under the eyes, take the tip of the Beauty Blender and from side to side, bounce the foundation from inner to outer corner of the eye.  Again, it won't look like you are doing much at first.  Keep going.  You won't have to get the surface of the sponge loaded more than four or five times in most cases.  You keep bouncing around and around the skin and suddenly you will see that the skin is covered, but still looks like skin.  THAT Is what you are going for.  Any other application method does not do this foundation justice and will not be as realistic/flattering looking.  COMMENTS Although I am not as fond of this as I am&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Graftobian-HD-Creme-Foundation-Super-Palette-Neutral/dp/B004IBU2O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Graftobian HD Creme Foundation - Super Palette - Neutral</a>, which is also available in individual colors, this is as close to it as I have come so far.  My problem with the Dermablend is this- it has sunscreen in it.  Many times when wearing this level of foundation, there is a special occasion involved.  That usually means photos will be taken.  Sunscreen makes for some pretty weird effects on film.  It will look white, or off color in certain light as well.  You can use this at home and think it looks perfect, but in some light it can look really off.  If this did not have sunscreen in it, I would like it better.  However, if you really love sunscreen and don't plan to have photos taken in this foundation or don't care if it looks off in photos or on video, then this is a nice foundation.  Wear is pretty much all day, even in humid weather, although it does come off it there is a lot of sweating involved and might need to be reapplied in certain situations.  Setting with powder helps a little bit but in really hot sweaty weather, that might not help.  THE BOTTOM LINE If applied as outlined in this review, this is an excellently performing foundation.  Although the color turned out to be lighter than I expected, if applied as I outlined, it will blend well with skin that is not an exact match.  Sunscreen in this will alter photos or look off in certain light, but if that does not bother you, then it still is a good choice.  Great coverage and generally speaking excellent durability (except extreme humidity and heat) this foundation could be an excellent choice for more natural looking coverage that does not crease excessively or crack off.  If applied any other way, results will be different.  RATING Four stars because this has sunscreen in it.  I prefer to have no sunscreen in foundation.  If someone wants to have sunscreen, I prefer to add it separately.  If it did not have sunscreen, I would like it a bit better.	1
I got this for my wife to try out, and she said it is an excellent cover cream. Easy to use, covers well, and lasts long. The only issue is that getting a skin color match; the coloring is strong, so you have to make sure it will match your tone.	1
Very nice job of covering brown spots, blemishes  and under eye area,  and was easy to blend.  The color was wrong for me and had way too much yellow.  I usually use "normal" skin tone or "medium beige" and the Almond Beige is a tad bit darker than my skin tone and a bit more yellow.  It does do a very good job of covering/blending so I may try to find the right color locally and would consider using.	1
This Dermablend Cover Creme was tested on a model with skin that tends to be oily, during an all day wedding reception held outside in the summer heat. Normally a user of the Chanel product line, she applied it by first putting on her hand to warm it and make it more viscose and then apply it with a makeup sponge. Her skin is olive colored and the caramel color complimented it nicely. There was no caking and it produced an even layer and consistent tone covering any small skin imperfections. It was used in conjunction with Dermablend Solid Setting Powder and lasted the entire day in the sun and heat without the need to reapply. Her conclusion that she was so impressed with the Dermablend that she had seen in Ads but never tried, that she was now switching from her Chanel products to the Dermablend line. She was delighted to be saving some money as well as her previous foundation was about 20% more expensive.	1
I have used many Dermablend products in the past and now and this brand only gets better!  This cover crme works great in covering marks or acne for me.  You warm it up in your hands, apply it to your face and then use a sponge to blend it out.  This covers wonderfully and stays on all day without caking up.  You can't go wrong with Dermablend products!	1
First, the color on this worked very well.  You do need more to use more product than I would like to cover trouble spots and it felt a little heavy.  You do need to work to blend it correctly so that it looks flawless.  It was good for my sensitive skin - no redness or irritation.  I'm also scent sensitive, but had no issues with the scent here.  I'll continue to use for the occasional trouble spot.	1
This product is a little darker than other pale ivory products I have used but the coverage is fantastic and easy to apply.	1
This creme is the perfect full coverage that doesn't clump up and stays where you put it.  It also comes off easily with all of my make up removes.  Of the coverage products and formats this is the first one I reach for now.	1
I found this foundation too dark for me so I am buying a lighter shade.  When I first put this on I realized the color was wrong but the makeup itself went on my skin just fine, evenly and smoothly.  When my lighter shade arrives, I shall come back and add something that explains my opinion better.  I have quite a few products from Dermablend and have been happy with them all.	1
Most days I prefer a liquid foundation, they are lighter and easy to mix with my serums to get smooth coverage that stays light and hydrating but full coverage. However as even my liquid was not able to handle when my eczema flares badly I was enthusiastic about trying this dermablend cream. First I like the color range, I have pale skin and can have a really hard time finding shade, many brands don't really go into the fair and lighter shades so it is always a tone off. I did still choose two shades but mostly because it is summer and my skin can get a bit darker. The color I choose for universal use is the rose beige. I was a bit nervous with beige in the title but I followed the chart and went with it. I have to say it is just about perfect. I was also worried with the weight of a formula that was in a heavy pot, and my concern was not necessary. A little goes quite a long way, I did my initial application with my fingers, and then blended and smoothed with a damp beauty blender. The formula on this is really impressive, it can go on thin enough to see my freckles with enough blending, or can be gently blended to cover the worst of my eczema. I was really happy with not only the coverage but the fact that it didn't cause any additional irritation and in fact some of the worst areas even looked a bit more healed after taking it off. The ability to cover what is often large raw areas that embarrass me too much to go out has made this a favorite in my makeup collection. I would give it more than five stars if I could.	1
I am now a real fan or Dermablend!  I got this for my daughter who loves makeup and knows more about it than I do.  She was very impressed by this as well.  The thick creamy texture allow you to easily apply less or more depending on the amount of coverage that you need.  It actually covers so good that you will not need a concealer with this.  I like the way that it can be applied with anything that you like.  A sponge, makeup brush or just your fingers will all work.  It's up to you to do what you want with it unlike liquid foundation.  It also doesn't rub off as much as any other foundations that I have tried.  I would recommend that you remove it with a good quality makeup remover rather than trying to get it off with regular soap.  I love the way that you can get a very natural look with this.  I can't say anything negative about this makeup.	1
I'm a fan of Dermablend--great concealers and powders, but this foundation wasn't my favorite. For one, it's a lot cooler (pink) than I was expecting (I got the shade 30w Yellow Beige).  It doesn't feel heavy on the skin, but it looked very mask-like. It did last on me all day and it was very full coverage, but it didn't look good.	-1
I love Dermablend Cover Creme and have been using it for ages, at least a decade. It lasts a long, long time. It is easy to apply, goes on smoothly, doesn't collect in wrinkles, and stays true to color. It comes off relatively easily with almost any makeup remover and a soft cloth. I love the colors, although I did make a couple of mistakes in finding just the right one. The "off" colors I got can still be used in different seasons though. I highly recommend this smooth, fine, long-lasting foundation.	1
I love this makeup brand. I have not worn makeup in my 42 years as much as I do since getting this brand. I am usually a no make up kind of person but have had great results with this makeup brand. I feel that this looks really well and applies even better. I love the color too.	1
This Dermablend Cover CremeFull Coverage foundation is very thick and hard to work with. At first I thought it was going to be smoother and work better but it was so thick. It started to almost peel off of my skin a little. It also stuck to my problem areas ( t zone ) and caked near the under eye. The color and pigmentation of the foundation was more on the warmer side. They are definitely darker than I thought it would be. I would personally It was on for an hour and was already becoming blotchy.	-1
I absolutely LOVE Dermablend makeup line. They have truly come up with a foundation and concealer that blends amazingly. There is never that caked on layered look. I like that I can build on top of it and have that flawless blend that I have always sought after with my makeup but have not been able to obtain until now. This particular stick matched amazingly with my own skin tones and blended in just as well. It is so easy to apply. You just open by twisting the top and you squeeze some out on a finger or a sponge and apply like you would any other makeup. SO I got one that did match my skin tones and the coverage is AMAZING, The concealer sticks along with the smooth camo foundation covers all my blemishes and skin irritants flawlessly. That really helps boost a girls self esteem when she can look in the mirror and her cystic acne is being well covered, Dermablend is created by certified dermatologist which is great because they know how to keep irritants out of the makeup they are creating, My skin doesn't breakout like it does with supermarket makeup when I use the Dermablend, I couldn't ask for a better makeup line to have fallen in love with.	1
Foremost, if your skin can handle a primer (and some people with very sensitive skin cannot always do this), try a light amount of primer before applying this this. It will minimize pores and make the product go on smoothly.  Now, this is the the proverbial "real deal." It is genuinely full-coverage. Therefore, if possible, apply extremely lightly. Then use a Beauty Blender to blend. And, keep blending. Then, apply just a little extra with a brush to areas that require more attention (a tattoo, a blemish, a birthmark, etc.). Then gently blend that (especially around the edges). Use a loose translucent powder to set this. Put it on with a dusting of a brush if you have dry to normal skin ... if you skin is oily, gently press it on with a powder puff.  You can achieve a natural look if you build the coverage very slowly and very carefully. Take your time with this and you will be very surprised.	1
Love this creme. I only need to use a tiny amount - more like dabbing it on areas I want to cover - and then blend with a cotton ball or fingertips.  It's not greasy or oily but it does go on smoothly. I rarely wear makeup for a full day so I can't estimate how it would hold up for ten or twelve hours, but it looks great for special occasions. Definitely makes my skin look more even in tone and consistency. One small container will last for a long time;  little goes a long way. It's easy to remove with water or cleansing products.  It works with my skin tone but of course that varies with the individual. So far, I'm very pleased.	1
The directions for DermaBlend Cover Creme are conflicting and missing a key item for best results.  First, the box has sunscreen directions for liberal all-over application. The paper insert, however, has instructions specific to spot-coverage for imperfections. This wouldn't be a conflict IF you could indeed spread this crayon-ish clay-like material all over. But you can't really, unless you mix it with some other smoother product.  This is best used as a spot cover-up, to be followed by a rather long setting period, followed by your favorite all-over make-up. An impressively tiny amount covers quite well. This product will last a long time. The spatula is great for hitting the exact spot and smoothing gently. Wipe it clean after each use and put it back in the box you so smartly saved. This little tool will be easy to lose and easy to find via your vacuum cleaner.  What's missing in the instructions? You skin cannot have any flaky areas. This heavy compound accentuates such irregularities, rather than helps to hide or ameliorate them.	1
The information given on how to find your shade family, undertone and shade are pretty interesting and really help to narrow it down to help you find the correct foundation for your skin tone. From there they give a great easy tutorial on how to use, warm with fingers and apply to face, using a brush or sponge tap tap tap your face to build coverage to your desiered look. To wash off, buff off in a circular motion. It doesn't state to apply a setting spray, but I always do. (I use urban decay and kat von d setting sprays for all day/night wear). I have rosacea aka red cheeks and when it is hot or I laugh more then usual it will cause my rosacea to become inflamed and be red all day long - I found that the dermablend really helped to keep my red cheeks at bay through out the day.  I did not need heavy coverage and the powder felt pretty weightless. There was no caking throughout the day either - which is a problem I tend to have. I did not have any breakouts or changed with my skin/oil production when using this powder and with minimal effort at the end of the day everything came off easily.	1
This is a great full coverage makeup. It only takes a little bit to completely cover any imperfections I have on my skin. It goes on smoothly with a little paddle that's included and then I finish blending with my clean fingertip. Usually one application is enough for the day. The color is great for my skin and it matches my other foundation products well. It washes off well when I clean my face at night. Although this is a one ounce container, it has been lasting me a long time. I'm really pleased with it.	1
Dermablend is amazing.  It covers everything up easily and does not sweat off.  You have yo use soap to get it off and then it comes off easily.	1
Dermablend's Professional Cover Creme is a winner for me. I have some age spots and this covers well. I like the way it goes on smoothly and stays on for hours.	1
Dermablend Crme Warm Ivory Foundation Makeup with SPF 30 , 1 oz is easy to apply and covers well. Make sure you pick the proper color to match your skin tone. There is only one thing that they do not mention is that you need the setting powder to keep it from coming off. I used regular face powder and it did the job somewhat, but really the maker should alert buyers that the setting poweder is not an optional product but a needed one.  This product covers very well skin blemishes or other imperfections. I have heard from others that some women apply this and then put their regular foundation/concealer over it. There are many ways to use it. I am pleased with how it works and even let a friend try it and she liked the coverage. This would be a 5 star product if the setting powder came with it, or was at least made known you had to have it.	1
This shade is a few shades too light for me, but it goes well around the eyes to lighten my dark circles I get from lack of sleep.  The cheeks are a darker tone from the sun, despite using sunblock.  What I like about this brand is the ease in which the cream is applied.  Not much is needed. It goes on fast and dries fast, and lasts a half day before fading or sweating off.  It isn't fragranced nor irritating, and it comes with SPF 30 sunblock..	1
I have quite a brthmark on my face in addition to some scarring from 'days gone by' with acne. This cream really is the only product that lasts any length of time on my face, I seem to absorb products like a sponge and this coverup doesn't sink into my skin and disappear. The color is perfect and looks neutral on my skin. This beige is perfect for warmer days (and tan-ish skin) without being too dark or orange-y. I also love that this coverup has a sunscreen in it too. It does not settle in the wrinkles and lines like other cover creams have from other brands that I have tried. This product is the first I tried from Dermablend years ago as a professional makeup artist and paramedical skin care therapist.....and it's still my favorite product for covering all sorts of imperfections from the ordinary situation to the more 'extreme'..... medical procedures.  TIPS: Tap it gently on the skin instead of rubbing on. If it feels "sticky" or thick, simply warm it between 2 fingers before using. Can be worn alone (with good color matching) or with foundation. Around the eyes, I get a much better result with using a concealer brush to "lay" the color on the skin. Use translucent powder on top (I use the white) for setting & longevity.  5 stars, highly recommended!	1
I got this for a friend of mine who was interested in trying it (It is not the right color for myself or my wife). She was suitably impressed with the make-up and coverage, but the color just wasn't as perfect a match.  This is a great idea for a product, but I think you have to be very careful about matching the color. It either works for you ... or it is going to look a little funny.	1
This was interesting product, unlike most products I have tried.  It has a little spatula that allows you to get the amount desired out of the pot.  You then warm between your fingers and it gets very smooth and soft allowing you to easily blend on spots you would like to cover.  I thought it blended well and that it covered nicely.  I would have liked to see a pot in the lid of the pot that I could keep the spatula.  Now I have to try and get track of it.	1
I ordered the Dermablend Professional Cover Creme in both Toasted Brown & Golden Brown. Both are nice, but the Toasted Brown is a little lighter & works well with my skin tone when I'm tan. It goes on well, & it's easy to apply.  Dermablend makes good quality products, & this one, like much of their other products, a little goes a long way. I have not had any issues with breakouts or irritation from any of their products, so I'd recommend if you have sensitive skin. All of the Dermablend products have provided excellent coverage.  The hardest thing for me has been selecting the right color. It's often hard for me to do in the store, so online looking at the chart is even worse. I'd recommend if you are like me & have trouble selecting colors, check your local store first for color you need, then look on Amazon. Their prices are often better & then that way you don't have to worry about choosing a color that isn't perfect for you. ;)	1
The Sand Beige shade of this Dermablend Cover Cream is listed as a light shade. And if you look at the swatches for the Light category, you will see that this is the lightest of the four available. That describes my skin tone exactly: light but with a tendency toward the fair end of the spectrum.  It was to my great dismay then to receive this product and realize that the color was totally off. Everything looked promising when the package arrived. The swatch on the outside of the box was a pretty close match to my skin tone. Then I opened it and was shocked to see just how much darker the real product was.  I wanted this product to cover a thyroid surgery scar on my neck. All I got was something that will draw even more attention to the imperfection with its fake tan orange glow. Ive attached photos so you can see for yourself.  Recommendation: Go much, much lighter than you think you need to with this Dermablend Cover Cream.	-1
This foundation goes on a little differently than most of the others that supply full coverage. It works best when it is slightly warmed. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to apply it with your fingertips. I put a little in the palm of my hand and let it get warm in my hand before using a sponge to quickly start applying it. It's wonderful for covering up skin imperfections on your face and hands. When using it on my face, I use a setting powder.	1
This is a nice foundation that covers well. It is smooth and provides medium coverage.	1
This cover-up works quite well.  I am a fair-skinned Caucasian of English and Irish descent and this blends in nicely with my skin tone.  It's especially good at muting post-shower blotchiness and acne.  Although the price might seem high, a little bit of product goes a long way on one's face, so you can expect it to last a very long time.  Just used it today, as a matter of fact, with the usual positive results.	1
Very helpful in covering up my scars. Easy to wash off with make-up remover. It didn't smudge once applied and I only had to reapply it occasionally throughout the day. Would definitely recommend for those seeking a cover-up make up.	1
Dermablend is fanastic for cover up, it takes care of some really stubborn problems. I've used it for bruises on my knees and acne scars on my face. If you're in between shades like I am, it's really easy to blend these together and you really only need a tiny bit, it goes a long way. The easiest application for me has been with sponges, not brushes unless you're working on a really tiny spot. I use this for overall face coverage and my beauty blender works great with it. Highly recommend if you need something reliable and are willing to spend the dough.	1

No complaints with this product or brand. This Dermablend product is fragrance free, perfect for my sensitive skin, and hides my blemishes perfectly (redness, acne, or sun spots).  I apply with my (clean) fingers and set it with some powder, and it lasts a long time. It is hydrating on my skin, and goes on very smoothly and blends very easily.  Don't use too much , a little goes a long way (for me, anyway). Good product!	1
This product does provide a lot of coverage, but it's not a dream product.. You will need more than a thin layer to cover, heavier coverage will need to be built up.  And it's VERY visible on the skin if you build it up to full coverage, which pretty much defeats the purpose of correcting skin--unless perhaps it's for a stage situation where you will only be viewed at a distance.  I also found this formula on the dry pasty side, and while it may sometimes be the only product that works, it is not a pleasure to work with. And you absolutely will feel having product on, this isn't weightless.  It's not irritating, but it also isn't second-skin-comfortable.  I've worked with this item in several colors and they ALL are darker than these images appear.  While I do appreciate that they have a wide shade range, I wish better photos and descriptions were provided.  If purchasing this, be sure you also get a setting powder, as this does need to be set.  I would also suggest a brush for application.	1
This is one of the better makeups I have found, it really covers up all the blemishes and spots and I am very happy with how smooth my skin looks.  It is a big difference when I wear this.  I have not had any reactions and it stays put for most of the day.	1
Wow. This Dermablend brand is amazing. I am no make up professional, but I have to say this cream cover goes on extremely well, and it covers any spot or blemish you have on your face. It does provide coverage, complete coverage. I found best used with an applicator. The tone matched the color extremely well, and it smoothes in nicely.	1

I was very skeptical about this product when I received it and realized it has the consistently of a thick paste rather than a creamy foundation.  I am a very low fuss person when it comes to cosmetics.  The instructions are easy to read and you basically scoop some of the foundation out with the included tiny plastic spatula, place it on your palm (or index finger), and gently rotate your finger on the product until it is smooth and ready to apply.  You then tap it on your skin and gently smooth it in.  You will need to allow about 2-minutes after application for the product to "set."  My skin looks flawless with this product however use of a setting powder is not an option - it's necessary otherwise my skin gets oily by mid-day.  What was really impressive with this product was how I was able to layer the product over my dark spots from sun damage and they virtually disappeared and the makeup didn't look heavy or caked on my skin.  I'm pleasantly surprised by this product.  It takes some practice to familiarize oneself in applying the foundation; however overall, I found it really easy to use.  The 1 ounce jar will also last a long time as a little bit of this cover creme goes a long way.	1
I have mildly red cheeks, so I use a cover-up that will even them out.  I apply the cover-up to them, then apply a finishing powder, and then my foundation. this cover creme works perfectly for this.  I apply it with a stiff concealer brush, by dabbing it all over my cheek.  It sits well underneath my foundation  and stays in place all day.  You get a lot in this jar, so this will last you a really long time.  That makes the price worth it.  Dermablend is a great brand, and has become one of my favorites!	1
This is a high coverage make-up, but does not look thick and caky on the skin. It comes in a 1 once plastic jar that is ideal for travel. It has a small spatula about 2  inches that can be used to apply the product on the face.  My first impression was that the make-up was very heavy, but once applied to the skin; it smooths out very even and has great coverage. I am very sensitive to smells, especially on my face, and there was nothing that bothered me with this product at all. I am very impressed with how nice it looks on my skin and pleased that it has a SPF of 30. I am older and have a few lines in my face and was concerned that this make-up would settle in the lines making me look even older. I was very pleased that at the end of the day I did not have make-up filled creases in my face. It cost a little more than I would normally pay for foundation, but for increased coverage and a longer lasting product this is a good one. This is made in Canada and I have never had any issues with the quality of items made there.	1
These cream is heavy, so much so that it comes with a small spatula for scraping it out of the jar. However, this strong consistency is good, because it does cover imperfections and it helps to match different skin tones, and once is applied, it doesnt look pasty. The cream must be kneaded between our fingers before applying it to our face, and it does go over it smoothly, and once its dry, it lasts all day long. I suggest finishing with a Dermablend powder of a similar shade for a flawless look.	1
This product is great for covering up anything from acne scars to tattoos. You don't need much to apply and it pretty much glides onto your skin. I use a beauty blender, I feel like it's a bit too thick for brush application. I've worn it in really hot weather and it held up really well, stayed blended onto my skin (face and chest) without needing re-application or smearing everywhere. The price is high, but this is one of those products that is well worth the money. If you need serious cover up that'll be reliable then I highly recommend this one, especially since just a little bit goes a very long way.	1
My tan-complection Filipina wife LOVES Dermablend.  She has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  It turns out fantastic the way she does it.  I wish I could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  I've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful SPF to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).  She's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the USA and has tried many products to stop them.  The only thing that has worked was going back to Philippines for 3 months.  We have no idea if it's something in the ingredients of something she eats here, or some sort of spray on the vegetables... but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of Dermablend products.  She has 5 different creams, a couple of powders and 2 sticks, varying shades of tan.  She can apply them very quickly now, but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such.  I'm pleased that Dermablend is available for people like her, though it's a little expensive for the amount you get (my frugal opinion).  She's worth it!  Afternote:  I asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they don't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion YouTube tutorials.	1
My tan-complection Filipina wife LOVES Dermablend for the dual purpose of concealing blemishes and bringing out tones of different parts of her skin.  She has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  It turns out fantastic the way she does it.  I wish I could put a video up of her before, applying and after.

My wife is a die hard makeup fan,  so when I mentioned Dermablend to her, she knew right away what is was. She is a natural/buff beige, but during the summer months, she buys different shades of cover up to match her skin after she tans, she does not like the white face and brown chest look,  she said it provides great coverage, a little goes a long way, does not need to be caked on and leaves her face looking great. Issue she ran into was colors on our computer screen did not match the colors received, probably due to our display, we checked out the same color on a few different screens, and the shades looked different on all 3.	1
Yet another great product with full coverage. I got this in hopes I could use the shade to add some contouring. I don't recommend the product as a contouring product, but for a blemish cover / full face coverage this will be perfect.  I don't have the setting powder by Dermablend, but felt my regular powder worked well.	1
No complaints with the Dermablend brand :) Always high quality makeup that is gentle on my sensitive skin and fragrance free.  This product is full coverage and has SPF of 30 which I love. It doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or cakey, and a little goes a long way. The texture is very creamy and blends into my skin so easily. It is perfect for hiding my imperfections like sun spots and redness. Make sure to set it with a little powder to make it last!	1
I really wanted to love this. Unfortunately, I don't. Not at all. First, the colors are much darker than other brands and darker than they look in the pictures. Second, this is not a good makeup for an elderly face. This makeup, for me, seems to show every wrinkle and flaw I have. It cakes and looks and feels dry on my skin. It is way too thick, in my opinion. I didn't like the finished look at all.	-1
My wife is a die hard makeup fan, she watches YouTube videos daily about makeup and what not, so when I mentioned Dermablend to her, she knew right away what is was, this color was a little off than what was expected, but could be due to our computer monitor. Would be best to get your color in person, and then order from Amazon, as it appears to be cheaper than most local stores. She said it provides great coverage, a little goes a long way, does not need to be caked on and leaves her face looking great. The product is a little pricey, but will last a long time, overall great Product, 5 Stars	1

I had never heard of this brand, but then I have always used drugstore foundations that run $10-$15.  For the last few months, I was using an Olay/CoverGirl one, since the store didn't have the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/COVERGIRL-Smoothers-AquaSmooth-Makeup-Foundation-Ivory-4-oz/dp/B00KTL2SAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">COVERGIRL Smoothers AquaSmooth Makeup Foundation Ivory, .4 oz</a>&nbsp;I usually use.  I noticed, though, the sun seems to be adversely affecting my skin this summer more than usual, which I believe was caused by lack of sunscreen, or too little sunscreen, in the Olay/CoverGirl.  Hence, I thought now would be a good time to test out this Dermablend before getting some AquaSmooth.  It's called a "cover cream" and comes with a spatula, but I just applied it with a damp makeup sponge, as I always do foundation.  Well, guess what?  It goes on like a really smooth foundation, stays on, and looks natural.  I was truly surprised.  The color is perfect for me, too.  It does feel slightly sticky on my face after being out in a scorching sun for a while, but it still looks good and obviously hasn't melted off.  I'm going to hopefully happily keep using it for the rest of the summer, and will update this review at the end of the season.	1
This is a very different type of foundation, very thick, it comes with a little spatula to remove some of the product for application.  This process did take a little getting used to for me, using the right amount and blending it evenly but once I got the hang of it it really did cover well and didn't use additional concealers with it.  I used a sponge to apply this and blend it for a nice even coverage, you could use your fingers, however if you are prone to breakouts or skin irritations then a sponge seems a better option for less oil and dirt. I used the Dermablend Powder over this foundation and it really set the look and lasted all day.	1

Nice coverage and color for a very attractive look. The coverage is a bit thick so remember that but it is very attractive.	1
Wow - the coverage of this is top notch. It's smooth, easy to apply and while perhaps not fully professional level, this isn't far from it. There are two issues with this...first the color is a bit darker than anticipated. I thought it might match a dark tan but this doesn't work for my skin tone...it's more mocha. Beautiful color but not mine. The second is the titanium dioxide which I found a bit more irritating especially in summer. This is a first with this brand but worth mentioning.	1
Darker than I expected, goes on smoothly. I used it to cover heart surgery scar but it almost seems to call more attention to it. Pleasant scent	-1
I recently was offered Durablends Cover Creme, Blurring Mousse and Leg and Body Makeup. Being already familiar with the products, I was happy to become acquainted with more. My Durablend story is personal. We have best friends, another couple, that visit us, or we visit them, at least once a year. We go on combined vacations together every three to five years. Wed spent a lot of time together before I learned that my friends face is almost completely covered in hemangiomas. It was a surprise to learn she had to apply makeup to look like shes not wearing makeup. Weve sat together many times since, just chatting while she goes through the process of what she calls putting on my face. Its interesting to watch and Ive asked lots of questions. She applies two liquid foundations and a powder foundation, followed by setting powder. Ive watched at least a dozen times and still find it dramatic. Its not a process that can be rushed if done right, but when it is, it can last an entire day with just a little touchup. I saw it for myself when New York weather caused our flight home to be cancelled. Twenty hours later and way behind schedule, wed collected luggage and were standing at passenger pickup in bright morning sunlight. She whispered and asked me to check if her makeup was still holding up. I was amazed to see no cracking or wear. The foundation was still working. Even the darkest portion of her biggest hemangioma remained completely invisible. She gave me my first Dermablend, a tube of Camo Concealer. Used with the setting powder, it erases the dark circles under my eyes that I get every allergy season. One application in the morning takes me through the entire day without even a touch up. Remembering that, I want to stress the importance of getting the right shade, and that some experimenting is (probably) going to be necessary. I was lucky. She nailed the right shade (light / sesame) for me perfectly the first time (I wouldve picked Natural and been wrong). If you're dealing with a large area, its pretty much a given that youll need more than one product in one shade. While you shouldnt expect to get it right the first time, you just might be able to come close. There are many tools on Dermablends website, plus online tutorials, there and on other sites, that look to be invaluable for making the leap if a push is needed. Dermablend isn't regular makeup. Its confidence in a bottle (or tube, jar, etc). I know the way it feels to use it and not think of the dark circles beneath my eyes when the occasional need arises. For others, that use it everyday just to feel comfortable enough to leave the house, it must feel transformative, as much inside as outside.	1
As with other Dermablend covers that I have tried, a very, very little of the product goes a very, very long way. The instructions recommend that you put a spot of it on the back of your hand and work the product to warm and loosen it; I think this is very good advice as the product really sticks to the first spot you put it on (including the back of your hand). The cover is 100% and still let's your skin look like skin. It is also water-proof, sweat-proof and practically soap-proof. It's really hard to get it off of skin (especially the back of your hand). Both the Reddish Tan and Toasted Brown can be used as a dark contour, even if your skin is pretty dark. I love how the Reddish Tan looks like dark suntan. There is no scent and I haven't had any breakouts or skin sensitivity, although I tend to have pretty tough skin and don't usually have any problems.	1
Okay, so by now I've tried a whole range of Dermablend products - mostly good, some meh. But the cover crme is the best of the bunch and truly what I think of and what I want when I think of Dermablend - which is FULL coverage, anywhere, everywhere. If you can only get one product from their line, this is the one to get. If you want the product that made Dermablend its name, this is the product to get. Of course, first you have to match your skin tone. Keep it mind that your skin has different shades from part to part. The skin on my face is different from the skin on my leg or on my hand. You have to have at least two shades, if not three so you can blend to the perfect match to whatever area you want to cover.  I have medium tones of Southeast Asian ethnicity. My skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.  I tried Warm Beige Chroma 2 1/4 but it was just too pink for my face. It did not have the yellow undertone that looks best with my skin. However, I did try the Yellow Beige Chroma 1 1/2 and it was a good match.  With the jar of product comes a little spatula. Don't lose it! Scrape a little product with the spatula and put it on the back of your hand. Don't put too much. I made the mistake of putting too much product out the first time and had to discard half of it when I didn't use it. A little truly goes a long way because this is really thick, hence the full coverage. So, just scrape less than what you think you might need. Let the product warm on your hand for a bit and then apply on the skin area in question. I use my index finger. It covers my really dark acne spots and pimples. If it was dark enough for my legs, I would have used it on them for a flawless look. It thoroughly conceals any imperfections. I apply some setting powder, let it set and then brush the excess off and then use a setting spray. It lasts ALL DAY.  Also, with the amount of product you have, depending on how much area you need to cover, I can easily see this one jar lasting me a very long time, even with every day use.	1

I'm not African American, but I am Hispanic with a tan right now. Normally, I don't like to tan like I did when I was a kid, but this summer I've spent a lot of time landscaping our yard, and despite wearing sunblock, my face has tanned. I did add a little lighter foundation to get the right tone, but it's so nice and dark, it covered all the wonderful dark spots the sun has graced my face with due to exposure. The added benefit is, since the foundation is dark enough to keep my face from further sun damage. It's pricey (on a teacher salary anyway), but a little goes a long way.	1

Its not a process that can be rushed if done right, but when it is, it can last a very long time. We and our families were up almost twenty straight hours when weather interfered with our flight home. Coming out of the airport and into the sun, she asked me how she was holding up. I was amazed that if anyone needed a touchup, it wasn't her. Id accepted for decades the dark circles under my eyes every allergy season. She gifted me a tube of Dermablend Camo Concealer and a little jar of setting powder. She nailed the shade perfectly (light / sesame) (I wouldve picked Natural and been wrong). I think Dermablend is amazing for the coverage it provides from so little product. If you were counting on Dermablend to help change your life, I get it because Ive seen it happen. If you aren't satisfied that it looks real or natural, I politely suggest that you explore more of the options Dermablend provides. Pay attention to where the shade of your skin falls on the range of hot to cold tones. There are plenty of tutorials on-line to help one pick color(s).	1

A little goes a long way, but how it ends up is the issue. The feeling is Very greasy and heavy, and my pores looked and felt very clogged with this. It cannot be used alone without looking rather strange. It covers pretty well, which means that you have to add back shading to look like a real person instead of a plastic toy. When you add powder (I used this same brand to try and follow suggested use), it gets rather muddy and cakey, looking very thick.  I took it off after a very short while because of how yucky it felt. I didn't care for this product, but in good news, it does help block sun.	-1
I occasionally use theater makeup in order to get the coverage I need. Unfortunately it is usually very heavy and greasy, making me break out. This product provides excellent coverage. After applying rather heavily, there was some slight stickiness but that disappeared within 15 minutes. The photograph shows how much it took to do my entire face and neck, remembering that I applied it heavily. The second photograph shows how it will not cover up a large, raised mole, nothing will, but color wise it made it a lot less noticeable. Sometimes I use a setting powder, sometimes not. Nice to know that it also has a high SPF.	1
I love dermablend products all that I have tried worked great. I just need to find the "right" one for my skin tone. Basically I'm just trying to cover the redness on my face. This product does that well while providing sunscreen which is awesome. I love this stuff because 1.) its a sunscreen, 2.) its in a compact container, 3.) it last me all day. I apply once in the morning to cover my red face, it last me all day. Easy on easy off with soap and water.	1

This is a very good quality make up. It's a bronze foundation, so I use it along my cheek line, and it stays on all day. I love that it has SPF 30, because I've been reading up on different kinds of make up, and this is the best for my skin. I love the Dermablend brand, it's my new favorite.	1
Dermablend Cover Creme Foundation is a very different kind of foundation than any I have used before. I followed the directions carefully and rubbed a tiny bit of the cream against the back of my hand to soften it and it really does go on my face so smoothly. I only use a bit during the day and it lasts all day. I do touch it up again if I'm heading back out in the evening. I haven't tried the translucent powder to set it yet, but I'd like to. It blends easily with fingers or a sponge and offers pretty good coverage. The Warm Ivory is very light but I'm pretty pale so it works ok. The warmer color works better for me than the Pale Ivory in the summer.  I've used it daily for about a month and have only used a tiny bit. I imagine this container will last at least six months, probably more. My only complaint is that the makeup does settle into my tiny wrinkles and makes them appear more pronounced. Overall, I've been very pleased with the makeup.	1

I love, love, love this stuff. The color is a little darker than expected, but the coverage is just excellent. It's on the heavier side, so it's not every day makeup for me, but it's perfect for a special occasion. It covers so well and feels great going on the skin. It's long lasting, too.	1
it goes on smoothly and you only need a little bit to get the best coverage. the best part about this is that it hides scarring and blemishes on your face. and when you finally take it off at the end of the day, your face feels smooth and soft. i have a negative reaction to most makeup foundations but, this one didn't cause a single blemish!	1
My wife is a die hard makeup fan, she watches YouTube videos daily about makeup and what not, so when I mentioned Dermablend to her, she knew right away what is was. She is a natural/buff beige in color, but like to have different shades of foundation for the summer, because your skin tone will depend by how much your out in the sun. She said it provides great coverage, a little goes a long way, does not need to be caked on and leaves her face looking great. The product is a little pricey, but will last a long time, overall great Product, 5 Stars	1
This also works as a sunscreen.  It's of course a woman's product, but as an old man, I find it useful to use on my wrinkles and old age scars.	1
This is an awesome creme foundation. My favorite so far! It is a little darker than I anticipated, but that worked out well for me. You don't need to use much to get good coverage, this way it also doesn't look caked on. Very natural look. I wear this all day long without reapplying too. Love that this covers up all my blemishes!!	1
I really like this product. It is smooth and feels good on my skin. The coverage is amazing and it stays put. A little goes a long way so use carefully. The generous size of the jar assures a long lasting supply.	1
I love this dermablend product. Actually all their products I have tried worked great. I just need to find the "right" one for my skin tone. That's hard though because you see I use this to cover my natural redness. I have plenty of color but my face is "almost" always tinged red. SO I love this stuff because 1.) its a sunscreen, 2.) its in a compact container, 3.) it last me all day. I apply once in the morning to cover my red face, hasn't happened yet but eventually someone is gonna see it and ask me why I "a man" am using make up. I will say hey whoa no hold up. This my friend is tinted sunscreen. Fortunately it says it right there on the container so I'm golden (in more ways than 1 lol). I get tired of people asking me if I have been on vacation - NO, I have not been. It's just my face tans very easy and then there is a tint of red although I am not burned. This stuff cover s the red, doesn't get on my shirt, last all day. I love it.	1

This is a thick foundation, I wouldn't use it unless you had something to cover up. If you do, then this is a good foundation. It comes with a tiny paddle, but I prefer a sponge. If you have age spots or acne, this will do a pretty good job to cover it. It blends well, and doesn't feel oily, though I have dry skin and could use a little of that! But anyway, it's a nice looking foundation and it does the job.	1
This Dermablend Cover Creme does a very good job of covering my freckles & gives my face a smooth looking appearance. It lasts all day & washes off easily with soap and water.  Definitely recommended!	1
As stated in a previous review of a different shade, This is my new favorite brand! This cream is definitely more of a full coverage and goes on a bit heavy. I have found that this is best when I need it to last all day because it does not budge. This is super effective in covering up every single blemish or discoloration. The jar is actually huge... it will take awhile to go through this. It comes with a spatula to scrape the foundation out- a little bit goes a very long way. Overall, I am pretty happy with this. However, this shade is definitely a little too dark for me. It is for someone with a medium skin tone. I am more of a light/medium skin tone.	1

Dermablend works so well for me. First, a little dab covers my imperfections. This means this jar will last a really long time. Next, it goes on smoothly. It's not dry or cakey. By the same token it stays put. I don't have to reapply it throughout the day. I apply this coverage and set it with MAC powder and I am good all day.	1
This makeup goes on very smoothly and a little goes a long ways.  It covers evenly and should hide blemishes and tattoos.  I wrote on the back of my hand with a black Sharpie and was completely hidden by the cover creme.  It seems to stay on very well so if you use it on your face it should last all day unless you rub it off or it wears against your clothing or jewelry.  If you apply it at points where your clothing comes into contact with it your clothing will get stained since it's not permanent.  It is a beautiful chocolate brown color tone.	1
I have heard of DermaBlend but never thought to try it! It is most definitely worth it!! It goes on so smooth and evenly! It is very light. Not caked on and looking like you have a ton of makeup on. It breathes well! I love it	1

I have hyper-pigmentation scars on my face; they take up to a year to fade away. I usually use any cover up and get okay coverage and deal with the shadowed look on my face. I tried the DermaBlend and the scars/spots disappeared for the day. It can't hide the texture of your skin as well, but even that blended out a bit. I am happy to report the product will get me through the dark spot phase.	1
I have loved all the Dermablend products I've been trying lately.  I find they offer the same high quality as department store brands but contain much more pigment in them.  This particular cream makeup is for dry skin only.  It has a beautiful luminous finish and the trademark Dermablend high concentration of pigments. But it goes on with noticeable slip.  I used a makeup sponge to apply this.  It looks wonderful but was definitely on the oily side for my skin type. A bit of powder to set this takes down the slipperiness.  I prefer some of the other products in this line such as the powder foundation.  I have slightly oily skin and large pores and that worked better for me.  If you have dry skin you may like this a lot.  I recommend visiting a store that sells this to make sure you get just the right matching color for your skin.  This is very high quality high end department store makeup for those who want high coverage to hide more obvious imperfections.  It's worth the higher price if you want higher coverage and a truly flawless look.	1
This is heavy duty - stayed put throughout a hot day of bbq.  I chose this because I knew I would be on the run all day and it has a high spf as well.  Typically I prefer a lighter coverage or tinted sunscreen.  If you want full on coverage that lasts - you won't be disappointed.  I am pale and this color perfectly blended in with my slightly sun kissed skin.	1
I normally don't wear foundation daily, only when I'm going out,but I've heard good things about this brand, so I gave it a try. This is going to replace the brand I was using, I love the texture and the feel of it on my skin. It was like I wasn't wear anything. I was really happy that for once I got a sample cosmetic that actually fit my skin tone! HIGH 5!	1
this works pretty well but I ordered a shade that was really too dark for me.  Overall I do like it and I'll be buying it in a lighter shade.  It was easy to apply and covered well!  Nice and smooth, and the ingredients seem to be high quality.	1
I love this stuff. It blends so easily, isn't too heavy and it has moisture in it so it doesn't get cake like on your face.  A shade darker than I thought it would be. Highly recommend.	1
I use this to cover my red face and it works well. I don't want to look like I am wearing make up and this stuff allows me to pull that off. The fact that it IS a sunscreen allows me validate wearing it. Sure I wear for vanity (To conceal my redness) but its nice to know it has a utilitarian purpose in blocking sun damage. I am no make up expert, I use a little of this every morning then add a little of their powder to remove shine and I'm good all day. It's still on when I wash my face after work. I like this product.	1
Excellent coverage for concealing imperfections, discoloration, even scarring.  I skip concealer when using this.  The cream foundation is thick, as would be expected.  I usually use MAC foundation sticks, so this is a bit heavier than my usual routine.  It's good for when I really want to go out and put on a full face.  Use your fingers or a makeup sponge for even application.  I am typically one of those people who prefer to use a tinted moisturizer and some eyeliner and leave it at that.  The golden brown is darker than I expected.  Even with the shade charts provided on Amazon, I'm not entirely sure how to get a good color match online without seeing the full spectrum of the color palettes available.  If you fall between two colors, it's not as though you can easily order both colors just to dab a little on the back of your hand and see which one suits you best.  Especially at these prices.  I used to say you couldn't buy shoes online, it's really something you have to try in person.  Generous free return policies though have proven me wrong.  Maybe I'll be wrong about buying makeup online too.	1
Full coverage  SPF 30. Love this product. I use it for those days in the sun to provide  a little coverage for my face. Especially pool days  and river days. I really like the texture  of the cream and it seems to stay  on pretty well even when I sweat. It comess with a little scraper that I don't use. I just use my makeup brushes to get it out.	1
Like many people with thyroid/hormonal issues, I have skin discolorations.  I have what I affectionately refer to a Lizard Spot on my neck.  It's about the size of the palm of my hand.  When the spot becomes inflamed, I use make-up to cover it.  This is why I chose to try Dermablend Professional Cover Creme.  PROS 1) Following the company's instructions, Dermablend Professional Cover Creme took only *one* application to completely cover the discoloration on my neck! It took very little make-up to do the job, too. 2) Makeup feels light going on and doesn't feel thick or greasy once applied.  (It feels like a good-quality sunscreen, actually.) 3) Provides 30 SPF. 4) I used it with a transparent mineral powder, and Dermablend Professional Cover Creme stayed *fixed* all day. 5) Because it's lightweight, it will work well on most skin types. 6) It *does* cover discoloration and some types of scarring. It even masked a keloid scar I have on my cheek and made my skin appear smooth. 7) Comes with tiny application spatula. 8) Is easily removed with cleansing cream and water.  CON 1) Dermablend is expensive.  Dermablend is excellent quality make-up.  It's designed to Cover: and it does just that.  Even though I've embraced my Lizard Spot, it's *wonderful* to apply a tiny bit of Cover Creme and have it disappear.  Many women view make-up as armor against a working world that judges any and every imperfection. I consider Dermablend an extension of my confidence. On those days when my discoloration in inflamed, Dermablend *is* a moral booster.  I've taken to calling it Confidence in a Jar.	1
The LOreal Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  They earn being in a higher-end category in my opinion. They do not seem to be scented or too chemical. The jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups. I have many favorites among them, yet I believe they all stand very well on their own. Some two or more of these creamy products come with an application spatula, and this appears to be an optional extra.  Also, there is a little instruction leaflet included with every product.  I hope it is going to be efficient way to review all of the ones product in this line, including compatible products along the way. Respectively:  1. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CRME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF): 2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF): 3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF): 4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF): 5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO (NO SPF): 6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF): 7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25): 8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)  I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.  I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.  There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others. I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.    1. DERMABLEND COVER CRME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF): This is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.  My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  I hadnt read the instructions yet.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have dry patches on spots.  Now I get it!  This particular crme has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  This product is soft and smooth.  It appeared to be a very thin product at first, and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it.  It is lovely.  If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections; and when I apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleam in the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.  The other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.  She has said that even in my home with shades closed I am exposing my skin to potential damage.  I score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.  The two colors I have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored LOreal Dermablend Pro products with them.  Ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.  2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF): needed. The wonderful crmes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, with the cotton puffs. It hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the crme, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, since Amazon is not going to know my exact skin color, I have experimented, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using the various loose powder shades together:  Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose.  A. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of crme I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000%! For me.  I have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally; and not necessarily all over my face and neck. U have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough, though you may find it unnecessary; you can still have a dimensional look.  I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend crme applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.  One thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.  3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF): These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  The mist isn't as fine as I had expected, but it works for me.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple for me.  4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF): This a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the varying built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Crme, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.  Not only can I spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. I also can add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. Win-Win-Win.  5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF): This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  I do know that is stretching it though. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional Liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!  6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF): Wow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have. Double win with this product results!  This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much. I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this Quick Fix product first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, look, only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through.  This is my personal preference.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. I love it.  7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25): It is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.  It just didn't muss up and rub off.  8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30) This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Crme, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn, as my dermatologist has warned about.  I have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot.  This covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000%, and very smart.  Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!	1

Pick your poison, as I have purchased some powder and cr&egrave;me blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.  I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.

As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.  Not only can I variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. This shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the cr&egrave;me, and the powders, I may experiment with altering the look as in 2A.  Win-Win-Win.  I also may add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.  5.

This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which I won't feel shy about adding puffs of Dermablend Professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and I will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2A.  This is a lovely product.  I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.

Dermablend is a professional cover creme that works beautifully to obtain flawless skin. Many women have acne, scars or different pigmentation on their face and neck. This creme was designed to cover up those issues, when used as directed. If you are going to use this as a sunscreen, apply 15 minutes prior to sun exposure and reapply every two hours to benefit from the 30spf. If using as a foundation, you only need to apply once and if you also use the setting powder, it will stay put without smudging for 16 hours. The deep brown shade is the darkest of four shades. It can be used as a contour creme also.	1

I have used this makeup recently and it is a very nice, consistent product. It is a creamy application which spreads and blends easily and provides good coverage to provide a subtle consistency that hides skin imperfections and also moisturizers while offering sun protection. This is essential as I burn quickly when I am exposed to outdoor direct light.  Based	1
Yeah, I guess this is primarily a feminine product, but I'm an 84 yea4 old guy and I find that this wonders for camouflauging my wrinkles/  The color is right on my old skin, neither too dark nor too light.  What's more, it leaves my face feeling refreshed.  So you old guys like me will find this a very good creme to be used on your face.	1
I love DermaBlend products & this cover creme is great. It goes on smoothly, covers well, and does not cause irritation. This cover creme comes in different shades, so be sure to look at other listings for the variety of shades. It's hard to choose the right color, especially online. I'd recommend if you are unsure about colors, go into a local store that carries it to compare shades, then look on Amazon. At current time of writing, the price for this is less expensive than at my local department store, even factoring in S&H.	1
Reviewed by my wife: I have several Dermablend products: the "CoverCreme" in several colors; the "Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation"; the "INTENSE PowderCamo". I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!  This full-coverage foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It comes with a paddle for mixing colors, but use it with a gentle touch, as just a simple swipe of the finger across the surface of the creme produced complete, opaque coverage. It gives a nice satiney finish that is easy to layer with other makeup like blush and highlighter. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. It removes well with just soap and water. Truly excellent product.	1

My wife is a die hard makeup fan, she watches YouTube videos daily about makeup and what not, so when I mentioned Dermablend to her, she knew right away what is was.  She is a natural/buff beige, and this color matched her skin tone perfect. She said it provides great coverage, a little goes a long way, does not need to be caked on and leaves her face looking great. The product is a little pricey, but will last a long time, overall great Product, 5 Stars	1
If you're looking for a product that will cover up imperfections in your skin completely (even dark spots under your eyes), this is great. It goes on smooth but covers up well.  I love that it has SPF 30 in it as well to protect my face for young skin for years to come.  I'm impressed with Dermablends products!	1
I chose this to cover some imperfections/blemishes/rosacea and it works as described.  I use a bit of this first and then my regular foundation for the rest (or just this alone).  The coverage is clean, it goes on smoothly with a bit of warmth on my fingers, and stays on fairly well most of the day.	1
Dermablend products are the bomb. They cover up scars, acne and discolorations or flaws on your face, but it doesn't feel heavy. If you want to use it as a sunscreen, you will need to apply every two hours. If you want to use as a foundation, you will need  to apply in layers and when done, use the powder to finish the look and set the look. You can also use lighter shades for highlighting and dark colors for contouring to get that perfect face This product has not caused any irritation to my skin and works extremely well. It also comes with a paddle so that you can apply in small amounts where needed.	1

I have Asian light skin, and this color blends in well. It's great to even out skin tone and very slight blemishes. However, it won't conceal red blemishes or age spots that well. So as a concealer, it doesn't work too well. It's best as just a light foundation to keep the skin from looking too shiny. The nice thing about this product is that it does have some sun screen capabilities, so that you don't have to forgo the sun screen when using foundation. As for the product itself, it's extremely hard and dry. I don't use any makeup sponges because it's too dry. I just use my fingers to try to blend it in.	1
I love this stuff! Makes my skin flawless! I use the concealer and the foundation and it lasts all day long! I use a moisturizer and a primer before I apply and use a setting spray.	1
This is a maximum coverage cream which can cover scars, acne scars, birthmarks, bruising, burns, hyper-pigmentation, lupus and vitiligo. As such, I found it just a little too heavy for daily wear if you need minimum coverage.  The cream comes with a little paddle which you use to dip a dollop of the make-up onto your hand to warm it. Just straight from the jar, no warming, the make-up is rather thick and waxy.  You start with a light coat then add more layers until you get the coverage you need.  A setting powder is a good addition to make the make-up last longer.  Dermablend makes a cleaner which works well to remove the make-up.  I think it is really difficult  to pick a color match online. The golden beige has a yellowish undertone. The sunscreen is a welcome and appreciated addition.	1
I have some Dermablend that is a bit too dark, but love it even though I have to blend it with a lighter foundation. This color pretty much matches my skin. I don't wear a lot of foundation, but this one seems to stay on well, blends well with my skin and covers my broken veins and redness on my cheeks. I do use a primer to close my pores on my nose and that works with minimizing the pores and the foundation sinking into them. I also use powder to set the foundation. With my tube of "too dark" Dermablend - I used it as a contouring cream and I must admit that combined with this full coverage foundation--it is a really good look!	1
This review is for the Dermablend Professional Cover cream in Reddish Tan.  Dermablend makes a quality product, & this cover creme goes on smoothly & covers well. I have never had a problem with breakouts or irritation while using their makeup. It's nice that is SPF30. I don't usually buy alot of makeup, & once I find a foundation or product I like, I tend to stick with it. I have a hard time picking colors, when I'm in the store, & it's even harder for me online. This one is a little dark for me right now, but when I get a tan, it will be perfect. It covers well, & is easy to apply.  I've attached a few pictures so you can see the reddish tan color to help you decide if this is the right color for you.	1
My wife tried this on and was a little shocked. First, it comes with a tiny spatula to apply it to your skin. That tells you a lot. My wife says that she doesn't want to cake it on, but she applied it and it did cover, but it went on very thick. She really doesn't need any make up, but she doesn't really see that, so she went into the bathroom and was in there for a little while and when she came out I could see that she had done half of her right side and she asked what I thought. You have to understand, my wife is a very attractive woman, and when she asks me a question she knows she will get an honest answer....not brutally honest, but honest. So, this was my answer....."If you had a lot to cover up, I think this would be perfect. However, since you had good skin without any real issues, I think this might be overkill for you. You might want to let [name removed in case she reads this] try this, because I think it would be perfect for her." She actually agreed. She felt it was too thick for her. I asked her how she would rate it and she said 4 stars because it does what it says. Removing it was a bit of a chore and so, one star down.	1
This is not the coverage of the old Dermablend cover up. This is very similar in texture to Pan-stick if you remember that. Strong coverage with some "slide". As in, I couldn't have worn this often in my younger years because it feels quite like it would have aggravated my skin.  Still, it covers my skin irregularities but I don't have anything like a birth mark and not sure it would cover something like that. I'd try it in person first.	1
It doesn't take much of this Dermablend Cover Creme to take care of business!  I use it for dark under eye circles & to cover freckles.  Just a little will do the trick.  Excellent coverage that lasts!	1
This is by far the best foundation I have ever used. The coverage is something that you get from a high end foundation and I can honestly compare the coverage to Kat Von D's Tattoo Coverage Foundation. A few swipes with a large brush and you have the best coverage. It blends with your other makeup for a flawless finish that lasts through what you put it through. I sweat a lot with it being summer and this stuff doesn't clog my pores but stays in place and gives me full coverage all day. I love this foundation and will continue to use it. It works so great but doesn't cost as much as the other stuff which is great. Love it so much.	1
When you need spackle and ladies you know what I mean, this stuff is primo.  You receive a small paddle with it and you use it scoop the makeup.  Don't try using your fingers or a brush.  The foundation is brick but once it goes on your skin, it belts.  Brightens, covers and blends super well.  Wore it all day through 90 degree weather and through thunderstorms.  No touch up needed nor did it run.  Make sure you have a heavy duty makeup remover.  I tried the miscellar water and it did not even touch.  Used the IT Cosmetics melting balm and toner and bam, it got off.	1

I was pleasantly surprised by the Dermablend Cover Creme Full Coverage Foundation.  It's different from any foundation I've used before in that I need to scoop it out of the tub, warm it in my fingers first, and then apply it.  It takes less than I thought it would, but I've found that if I use a Beauty Blender to smooth out and blend this formula, it's easy to blend.  I don't get a mask-like line at the jawline, but the formula does blend away my freckles and minor to moderate blemishes.  Big, angry zits are going to need a separate concealer, but I'm pretty sure that's the case with that kind of blemish and any kind of foundation.  Some skin problems just have to be the center of attention, haha.  This creme foundation doesn't feel heavy to wear, and it stays on my face well enough for me, all day, when I use powder over it.  The powder might need to be touched up a couple times over the course of a day, but that's easy enough to do!	1
I accidentally ordered this in the wrong color, so will pass it on to a friend.  I did try it out, though, and it provides smooth, blendable coverage that really does cover large marks (veins, bruises, etc.) really well.  It also sets nicely, and doesn't rub off on clothes.	1
I really like this product, and it's a thick cream that somehow doesn't settle into your skin in an unnatural way.  While their stick product is easier to apply, this Cover Creme is also pretty fast to apply, and it really stays in place.  The coverage is pretty opaque, but that's what makes it great for covering up things you want to conceal.  Finding the correct color online was a bit tricky, but the color I chose works well with my fair skin.	1
While I do have lots of things on my skin I'd like to cover well, there is too much work involved in getting this product on in the morning - I don't have endless minutes to baby sit a product to get it on my face. It's not a liquid, so there's this little applicator to get product on, then 'warming' it on my skin. First trial, I used to much and I couldn't get it to blend in and had to wash it off. Second try with less went a bit better, but having to blend it in with tiny spots of application was a pain, and I still didn't feel like I had a smooth look. And note, the portion of the product I put into my palm to warm up didn't wash off easily with soap and water. More work and time spent I don't have in the morning. This was also much darker than I expected, I believe it was called warm beige, and it's more a rusty color and too dark for beige. At least my idea of beige...  Your mileage may vary, depending on getting a good-for-you color and with lots of time to pamper in the morning.	-1
Dermablend has been a consistent product for me. I got a foundation many shades too dark for me to try contouring. I'd say my results have been really good!  The coverage is spectacular, but this product is likely not meant for blending/contouring. I suggest it for hrs to cover blemishes and smooth texture. Make sure you get setting powder as it can be a little greasy.	1
This is the best tattoo cover creme out of all Dermablend I've tried. It doesn't cake, covers extremely well. I used 2 layers, and after each one I used setting powder. Once you find the right shade than you golden. My color was slightly too dark but then I blended the edges with other color. Just play and get better at it.	1
I have tried several Dermablend products recently, and this cover creme is definitely my favorite thus far. I think I have finally found my perfect shade for foundation (warm beige). It adds a touch of color without looking artificial, and I don't have to waste time rubbing off excess to tone it down. You can use the included plastic stick to scrape off some foundation (a little can go a long way, but it's a work of trial and error) to place on your hand and activate by rubbing, then applying to your face.  I also used it simply by using my finger to gather up some and then apply it to my face. As with Dermablend's other cover cremes, the only negative thing about it is that it's only somewhat waterproof, as indicated by the foundation left behind on my towels after washing my hands, and napkins from dabbing my face when sweaty. At least it doesn't all come off the face without a proper washing or makeup remover, however, so it's not completely bad. All in all, I was impressed by this even if it comes off a little too easily.	1

Love this stuff. It's not super heavy.  It's a big darker than I thought. Easy to blend! Highly recommend.	1
This color is a bit darker than I thought it would be but it's an awesome light weight full coverage foundation.  I like that it is more of a foam than a cream... The cream they have can be a bit heavy...this is a bit more light weight.  Overall only need one application.  Great coverage.	1
After years of wearing MAC cosmetics, I had no idea what I was missing out on. With the MAC makeup I wore, my face would appear very matte and dry. I went into MAC a couple times and asked how i could correct this and they recommended bronzer, a finishing shine powder, primer, finishing spray....I bought it all. None did what I really wanted but I didn't know better. Dermablend has done exactly what I had been looking for. The finished product looks hydrated and natural, more of a satin finish. The application is super easy also. I watched a video on the Dermablend website which basically is 4 steps: 1) Put a small amount on the back of your hand 2) Dab it onto your face 3) Blend 4) Use setting powder. The coverage is medium to full and a little bit goes a long way. The pigment saturation had me wonderfully surprised. I felt like very little did a great job covering my freckles. I've never had a makeup cover so well without the cakey feeling. I have been telling everyone about this makeup after using it for over a week everyday. I love it!!	1

If you want to use this product as a sunscreen, you have to apply it liberally 15 minutes before you get in the sun and then again every 2 hours. If you are using it as a crme foundation, one application is enough for 16 hours of lasting flawless skin. It hydrates continually and is great for sensitive skin. If you are using this as a foundation, make sure you set it with the pressing powder to keep it going for 16 hours.	1
Ordering online is excellent if you know the shade(s) you need.  I would suggest, if it's possible to do so, seeing it in person first so you know exactly what you are getting and how it will work on your skin.  I had to do that.  Dermablend Cover Creme is not heavy and blends easily.  It is great for covering imperfections.  I finally got the setting powder which made a lot of difference.  It's definitely worth a try.  I waited a long time because I thought it was like a heavy cover up.  It is NOT.  But, there is a bit of a learning curve, especially if you have been using, like I was, baked foundations or mineral powders.  Highly recommend!	1
Has really helped cover skin issues such as age spots, faint scars.  Sometimes in hot weather I need to dab a bit more on, otherwise it's a once a day application.	1
This product is amazing. My skin color match is a 60W, so it's a little dark for me, but WOW. The product goes on smoothly and covers flawlessly. It makes me look like I have glowing skin and feels luxurious. It's a little heavy, but that's what I expected, given the description. I love that this company makes such varied tones and shades for darker skin.	1
Found this extremely difficult to apply - it was hard, thick, and didn't blend well. But, as a professional cover creme, it is likely good for using this to cover scars or other imperfections, especially for photographs. I gave it four stars because even though it didn't work for me, it seems to cover well once it is applied. Would prefer 3.5 stars as it's fairly price and difficult to use.	1
This product was interesting.  It comes in a jar (as shown) and has a little spatula that you use to scoop out the product, warm it on your hands, and then apply it.  You absolutely do need to warm it.  It is almost like a thick paste.  I can see using this to cover tattoos or something similar - the coverage is high.  However, as someone who does have a few fine lines, it wasn't ideal, because the waxy texture of the paste means that when it's actually on your face it does settle in to the lines and create makeup creases.  I might try mixing it with a light BB cream to get a more transparent coverage.  It says that it's "never cakey" but after I had applied a thin layer using my hands and my blending brush I definitely noticed it to be more cakey than my normal liquid foundation.  I was expecting a little more from this product as the company has a good reputation.  Also, in terms of the color - go to your local Sephora or other makeup store before you order it.  I randomly got assigned to the Golden Beige and it was just slightly too yellow for my undertone.	1
Wow I love this stuff! I thought this would be too dark for me, but once I applied it, it matched in my skin and was perfect! I love that this has spf so I don't have to worry about the sun too! I was a bit confused when I first opened it and saw it was solid!! But then I read the instructions that say to put some on the back of your hand and rub in and voila! It turned it softer so I could apply to my face! :) I think this color will be too dark for me in the winter as I get so pasty white! But for my tan skin in the summer it works! And it stayed on all day!	1
I've seen Dermablend for awhile and I assumed the cover creme foundation would be too heavy, thick and suffocate pores. How wrong I was! The cover creme offers full coverage that is extremely light. Once applied, you cannot feel it as cover creme literally feels like your own skin. It's simply brilliant! A very little goes a long way, highly blendable... to prevent smearing top with a powder...  Doesn't disappear in a hot, humid area...hides light spots, dark spots, and redness... probably could provide nice coverage for a tattoo if it needed to... doesn't looked caked on... LOVE it!	1
Excellent coverage and really blends in well.  It can be a bit hard, though, whether using a finger or a sponge.  I rub a little bit between my fingers before applying and that seems to work better for me.  If I get it on right, it looks flawless.	1
This has great coverage. I couldn't use it because the shade was wrong for me and has too much of a warm undertone. I've used other Dermablend foundations and love them, so don't think this one would be any different. But yeah check out the shades online prior to buying so you pick the right one.	1
One of the most frustrating aspects of purchasing makeup online is to figure out the best color for yourself. In MAC I wear NC50 pressed powder so I took a chance with this Dermablend color. When I opened the jar I was so disappointed because it looked way too dark and red for my color. I decided to try it on my skin anyway. It turned out that this is the perfect color for me.  Around my chin area I have dark marks and this Dermablend did an excellent job covering it up (see photos). It took just the tiniest little bit to great complete coverage. After applying with the included spatula, I blended with my finger tip and then set it with a little loose powder. With the little that I used and with the size of this jar, I can see this stuff lasting at least a year.  I am super pleased with this makeup and super happy I picked the right color the first time around. The photos I've included with the makeup are before I put a setting powder - it's just the Dermablend blended with my fingertip. One of the pictures has a shadow from my phone, but I think you can still see the difference.	1
Excellent cover cream that is easy to apply and works great. It blends in with your skin and looks very natural.	1
This applies very smoothly and evenly, covering most blemishes and imperfections.  I noticed that a little goes a long way as it doesn't take much for good coverage.  It covered black Sharpie drawn artwork on the back of my hand very well, so I think it will probably cover a tattoo.  It will rub off some on your clothing so be thoughtful about what you will be wearing near this make-up.  It's not easy to wash off either, most of it comes off on the towel.	1
This is a very full coverage foundation. It's very thick and almost reminds me of the texture of modeling clay. Before use it needs to be warmed a bit with your hand to make it thin out so it's spreadable. It covers imperfections like redness and acne scars well. I only like to use one layer. If I use more than one it feels too heavy and makes my already oily skin feel too oily. I prefer to use this anywhere on my face except under my eyes. When I tried using it under my eyes it settled into the fine lines and made me look older. I'd suggest something more light and delicate for under eyes but if you just need a good, full coverage foundation for the rest of your face, this is a good one. It did take a few times to fully get the hang of using this makeup since I'm use to liquid foundation. I prefer to use a good quality foundation brush to apply this.	1

Great cover and easy to apply.  No weird smell, no caking, no build-up during the day.  Helps even and smooth face and also makes face feel super soft.  Love this stuff.	1
This foundation is different from liquid, powder or combination foundation products I have used in the past.  This product is dense and can provide a light or heavy coverage as desired. I recommend reading the directions on this.  I used the little spatula that came with the packaging, scooped a little foundation out and I made sure to warm the product up on the back of my hand before applying to my face with my fingers. I prefer a light coverage foundation, so I didn't use too much product.  This foundation does go on easily and has a really smooth finish.  I did top the foundation off with my Makeup Forever Ultra HD Microfinishing Loose Powder to set it.  The foundation stayed put all day and didn't cake up on me at all. I would recommend this because I like how the product works and that it has SPF 30 built in.  It would be good for those that like a heavier finish to their foundation.	1
have used many different types of foundation over the years, I will say that is different from any other that I have used. The product itself is a different consistency than other foundations.  This is almost like a heavy dense face cream, but a little bit more waxy than creamy. I like light coverage on my foundation, so I did not use a ton of the product to cover my face.  I'm sure that if you prefer a heavier coverage that this product could do that as well. I did read the directions, scooped a little bit of the product out with the provided spatula and made sure to warm the product up before applying-I did this on the back of my hand.  I applied the product with my fingers and liked that as I could control where and how much coverage I wanted. I like this foundation and appreciate that it has an SPF 30 built into it.  It didn't feel heavy or drying and left my face feeling nice and smooth.  I would recommend this product for those that don't mind applying their foundation with their hands instead of a brush.  Plus a little product goes a long way, depending on how much coverage you like you can always build it up.	1
This warm beige is darker than I expected and will look better on a person with olive skin or a deep tan. It is too dark for my complexion. In addition, this make-up does not spread well. When I apply a foundation, I expect a smooth flow with my sponge and this did not provide that.	-1
It's very lightweight and easy to glide on skin. Offers a great coverage. My only issue, perhaps mostly because of the sunscreen ingredients, is that it has a shine to it, so I don't like to use a lot of it all over my face. Other than that, it's a very nice foundation. It's not greasy at all. I don't have any breakouts from it. It also offers a great coverage for redness and sunspots.	1
My girlfriend and I tested the Olive Brown and Cafe Brown versions of this product.  I'm pretty white and she is from the Philippines, so she's somewhat dark to begin with.  The Cafe Brown color is about as expected.  The Olive Brown has more reddish tones and is probably a bit more reddish than expected.  You have to have the color that matches your skin color.  For my girlfriend Cafe Brown was a good color while Oliver Brown was a touch dark for her.  This is basically a paste sunscreen that covers your flaws.  The SPF 30 will provide good protection from the sun, although it might need to be applied every 2 hours if you're in the water or sweating heavily.  The product looks very natural.  It goes on thick but blends easily.  Has a light feel on the skin.  Does not feel heavy.  Skin feels smooth, no "sandy" feeling.  Can hide some flaws or imperfections and gives your skin a smooth and even appearance.  We recommend that you blend it in your palms before applying to your skin.  As mentioned, I'm very white, but using this product makes it look as if I have deep natural tan.  So it's not just for people with darker skin, but people with really white skin could use it too.  Might be better than some tanner as it's not greasy and doesn't run off.  The product is completely unscented.  It's a small quantity of product, but a little goes a long way.  We liked it.  It's a nice product more versatile than one might suppose.  5 stars.	1
This cover creme truly is full coverage.  What I like about these Dermablend products is how creamy they are.  As a result, they are very easy to apply and don't cake up on your face.  I used this and the concealer and I think this actually has better coverage than the concealer.  It leaves a smooth finish on the face.  It's not so easy to tell which color you need, but once you get that figured out you will likely be very happy with this product if you need the full coverage.  It blends very well and caused no irritation on my highly sensitive skin.  Also, it doesn't have any fragrance that will irritate those of you with chemical sensitivities.  This is a good product and recommended for sure.	1
This is a very good foundation, it does a great job of covering my beauty mark on the side of my face. It doesn't come off easily, so there is no need to keep reapplying during the course of the day. I have used other foundations, but I really like that this has sun screen in it, because it's much better for my skin.	1
(WARNING- In depth review.  If you prefer a brief summary, please see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE)  As a makeup artist, I have access to some pretty nice products to use for a variety of occasions.  When I saw Dermablend, I was interested to see what it was like and how good it might be to add to my kit in the future.  WHAT IS THIS FOUNDATION LIKE? Dermablend Professional Cover Creme comes in a flat wide mouthed jar.  The contents are very stiff but creamy, almost like a damp watercolor pan if anyone has ever worked with them.  Inside the box is a little spatula so that you can scrape the contents onto the back of your hand to warm it up and then apply.  There is also an instructional paper that presumably tells you how to best apply this foundation.  There is very little odor and the colors are saturated.  There is sunscreen in this foundation.  HOW DOES THIS PERFORM? FOLLOWING ENCLOSED INSTRUCTIONS (1 star rating) Here is where I have a different take than the instructions say.  When applied as instructed, I would give this only a star or two.  It does not provide natural coverage, and it looks quite frankly awful.  It settles in the creases and just does not like to blend either.  So, if following the directions, I would say that this is an awful performer.  The idea is that you scrape some out, put it on the back of your hand to warm it up and then apply - shown with fingers.  MY OWN APPLICATION METHOD (4 and a half stars) Here is where I have found a much better way to use this foundation. 1.  Make sure to have plenty of good skin care and your skin prepped with toner and moisturizer of your choice- but be sure it is not heavy if your skin is oily. 2,  Get a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/beautyblender-Original/dp/B000HRVC5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">beautyblender Original</a>.  That is of utmost importance.  If you take care of it, it will last for a long time. 3.  Wet the Beauty Blender and squeeze out all of the excess water. 4.  GENTLY dab the beauty blender until you pick up a small amount of foundation on the surface of the large end of the Beauty Blender. 5.  Starting in small sections of the face, bounce the Beauty Blender with the foundation around a section that is about as large around as a grapefruit on your face. 6.  At first it will look like you are not covering over much at all, but be patient, before you know it, you will have good coverage.  GRADUAL IS BEST. 7.  Don't bounce in the same spot over and over, bounce in a circular motion. 8.  After it is dried, then use a small makeup brush meant for cream (usually synthetic) and use that to conceal areas that might be very dark by dabbing gently over the area. 9.  Bounce on the concealed area edges gently to blend with the rest of the face.  SET WITH POWDER? I use&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Guerlain-Meteorites-Light-Revealing-Pearls-Of-Powder-3-Medium-25g-0-88oz/dp/B00HZSOLQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Guerlain Meteorites Light Revealing Pearls Of Powder - # 3 Medium 25g/0.88oz</a>&nbsp;in color #3 or#4 for most people.  It is very sheer and with a fluffy brush it adds a beautiful glow to the skin which is very subtle as well.  I do not like this foundation set with heavy powder, it looks overdone and caked on.  DOES THIS SETTLE INTO CREASES? I did find a little settling, but using the application method that I outlined it is minimal compared to other brands.  HOW WOULD THIS BE FOR PHOTOS? If you are going to use this for photos such as special occasions, please keep in mind that any foundation with sunscreen in it will often give flashbacks on photos.  It is better to choose a foundation that does not have sunscreen if you plan to have special photos taken with this on.  STAYING POWER When applied as I outlined, I found that it did last an entire day set with Guerlain meteorites, although a bit of settling once in a while in small spots.  COLORS I have two colors of this foundation- Sand Beige, and Medium Beige.  Both are as I expected and I did like the trueness of the colors.  they were not too one way or another as is the way with many foundation lines.  Medium Beige is more pinky in tone and Sand Beige a bit more butter cream yellow in tone.  I will update in the future with other foundation colors for comparison when I get the chance to do so.  WOULD I USE THIS PROFESSIONALLY? I prefer Graftobian HD Creme over this, although this performance does compare somewhat to Graftobian.  I did a side by side comparison with this and Graftobian HD Creme and found Graftobian to have a little better coverage with no risk of flashback and good HD appearance that I would probably stick with that. Having said that, however, this foundation is a decent foundation that is along the similar lines to Graftobian and would work okay in many situations.  Graftobian wore a little better but they were comparable.  THE BOTTOM LINE When applied as I have outlined, I like this foundation and it does wear decently.  When applied as outlined in the directions forget it.  This does have sunscreen in it which can cause problems in photos with flashback, but if you are not having photos done it does a decent job.  Setting with powder can make it look caked on, but with a powder like Guerlain Meteorites, it seems to work a little nicer when lightly dusted.  You can also use this foundation as a concealer with an appropriate brush.  RATING Four and a half stars, but only applied with the way I applied it.  Following directions, 1 or 2 stars.	1
This Dermablend Professional cover creme is great. It has a 30spf, it gives all day protection and all day hydration. It can be used as a foundation, imperfection cover up and a contour (you will need a light shade and a darker shade for contouring and highlighting), The most important thing about the creme is that it is a great concealer and it will last for 16 hours without smudging. This makes it easy to coverup tattoos, scars, blemishes, etc. You will need the Dermablend powder to set the foundation for it to conceal the best, otherwise, you may not get the results you want. This creme has been formulated to not look too heavy or cakey and to provide a flawless complexion.	1
I am using this more for a concealer and I apply it with a makeup sponge using a tap-tap application rather than rubbing it in.  That does not work for me.  This covers my Rosacea and my sun damage spots, which as I age, are becoming larger.  There is a learning curve to using a Dermablend product as I found out after applying too much and looking like a clown.  Start out with LESS and if need, build on that, but when I used less product and gently worked with it, it morphed onto my skin.  Not into the skin, but onto it with a lovely finish. It did not settle into pores or fine lines.  I have yet to use the setting powder, but for the length of time I have this on, it stays in place.  I have tried so many products to cover my issues and none have been satisfactory,  Now, after hearing about Dermablend for many, many years, I am finally using it and am happy with the results.  If you are near a store that carries it, it might be more productive to go in and see the colors on your skin before buying and see what works best for you.  Then, for future purchase do it online where it might be less expensive.  Give it a try, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by just covering up a mark or tattoo or scar that you are self-conscious about.  I know using it has made me want to take better care of my skin.	1
While I am not a fan of some of Dermablend's other products (their foundation in a tube products), the Cover Crme line excels.  It applies easily, and a small application covers very well.  You don't really notice it on your face, and it doesn't get cakey.  Like anything else, you need to determine the best shade for you.  It looks like Dermablend has over 20 shades, and the ones I have used tend to match the sample color on the website fairly close.  Keep in mind your tones on your display monitor will heavily influence that.  Dermablend does have a nice color selector tool on their website.  the Reddish Tan is one of the few shades I don't think looks natural when blended in.  It just reminds me of a spray tan.  The broad spectrum SPF 30 properties are, of course, great for protecting your skin.  Like most Dermablend products, the Cover Crme line is pricey, but it is a very nice cream foundation.  It wears exceptionally well, stays put, and also cleans up pretty easy with water, soap, and wipes.  Even though Dermablend recommends using a setting powder, I find it holds up very well for hours without it.	1

I really like this foundation! I haven't tried cream foundation before, and I found it easier to blend than a regular liquid foundation. I found it slightly darker than my skin tone, but I like it and will keep using it. I like that once apply it, it doesn't feel crusty or sticky. It comes with a little spatula to get a chunk out, but I prefer to use my fingers so I can put it on lightly. I use this over my blemishes, you can hardly see them after applying. For the 1 oz, a little goes a long way!	1
Here's something where a little goes a long way.  The foundation comes with a spatula and directions were to warm it up by mixing on the back of my hand before using.  It does a good job of concealing--the best concealer I've ever used.  Just blot, blot, blot.  I had a bear of a time washing it off my hands, though.  It is water and soap proof.  I was able to remove it off my face with makeup remover.	1
I followed the instructions and put a dab of it on the back of my hand to warm it and soften it, although I didn't have time getting dressed in the morning to wait for either of those things to happen and I bet most people won't either. It's easier to just dab it on your face and work from there. It is a little difficult to get out of the jar as it is not creamy. It's like hard butter. But once you start working it into your face, it spreads. These heavy makeups always leave a door open to clog pores, so getting it all off at night is equally important. My face feels a little greasy with it all on, but not excessively so.	1
This is by far the best foundation I have ever used. The coverage is something that you get from a high end foundation and I can honestly compare the coverage to Kat Von D's Tattoo Coverage Foundation. A few swipes with a large brush and you have the best coverage. It blends with your other makeup for a flawless finish that lasts through what you put it through. I sweat a lot with it being summer and this stuff doesn't clog my pores but stays in place and gives me full coverage all day. I love this foundation and will continue to use it. It works so great but doesn't cost as much as the other stuff which is great. Love it so much.	1
This Dermablend is not very creamy. I use a good moisturizer before applying, although I always use eye cream and a moisturizer twice aday. As I get older ( I'm older) under my eyes I'm getting dark circles ,This covered great. This comes with a little spatula if your nails are long, or not to contaminate the foundation on the jar. I'm fair, blue eyes, blonde weave, The color blends well for my face/ coloring.  Since this has a SPF 30, I also put this on the back of my hands after putting on hand lotion. My hands look smoother, and minimalize any brown spots .	1
If you need a full coverage foundation and you do not have very many facial wrinkles, then this Cover Creme by Dermablend may work well for you. It is definitely a thick makeup which will help to cover any pigmentation problems. However, because it is a very thick cream (almost as heavy as the average concealer), if you have the normal lines and wrinkles on your face that are a result of aging, then this foundation may catch in those lines and not give you a smooth finish. One of the important things is to blot your skin after the makeup is applied. The directions also call for a "setting" powder, however, that may also just increase the "caking" effect in the lines of your skin. Personally, I did achieve a good, matte finish with this makeup and did not feel the need for a setting powder. One thing to note, this color was a bit darker and a bit more orange than I expected. If you normally have fair skin, this color may work for you if you have a facial tan.	1
Dermablend Cover Creme Full Coverage Foundation provides 16 hours of coverage.  While providing full coverage, its also very light.  You apply it with your fingertips.  Dot or dab on and set with powder.  This little one ounce bottle will last a long time if you are using it as a concealer.  It also works as a sunscreen, because it has Broad Spectrum SPF 30.  To get the right color, you might want to go to a store and get find out your shade.  If you have areas on your face you want to conceal, this is the product for you.  Marketed as a foundation with sunscreen, it covers so well its a great concealer.	1
The coverage of this mousse is incredible! Here are my pros and cons  Pros - Easy application - Smooth texture - Full coverage - Noticbly clearer skin with regular use (likely due to using a higher quality product versus my regular stuff) - Variety of shades  Cons - Cost is higher than I like to pay	1
This is my favorite makeup. The Dermablend Cover Creme is definitely a concealer foundation makeup. The golden beige color is perfect for my skin color. I have several spots on my face and neck that I like to conceal and the Dermablend cover creme does it best. It comes with a spatula but I like to use the tip of my finger to get a very small amount and rub my fingers together to smooth out the makeup and then apply to my spots. One application covers them perfectly and I don't need to reapply. It is a sun screen as well, but I just use it for a concealer.	1
I'm not sure whether my monitor color is off, but when I requested this it appeared quite a bit lighter than what it actually is. So while I was able to test this out for it's intended use I haven't been able to wear it out of the house because the color is too dark for my skin tone. The texture is thick, but smooth.  It come with a small "spatula" type tool to remove from the jar.  Although it states you can apply without doing so, I really feel like it does need to be warmed/worked up prior to applying which is easy enough done on the back of my hand or palm. The coverage is good and does feel a bit heavy to me, but I don't normally wear a lot of make-up. I fell like this could easily leave someone looking too made up if you're not used to applying a product like this (like me!), but there are so many tutorials and information online to help with that.  Overall I am curious about how this product enough that I want to get some in the correct shade for me and even at the current price it is worth it because a little goes a long way.	1
My wife did not like this product. She said it was difficult to apply and did not feel comfortable on her skin. She said she would not  be using it again because it just did not do the job that she wanted it to perform..	-1
I am sure after using this product, that it is exactly what it touts to be.  That is a durable, full coverage foundation makeup.  Be sure that that is EXACTLY what you want because that is what you are going to get. I am a fair complected senior citizen with very fair skin.  Still a few freckles.  What I don't need is a product like this one.  I think that this product is relatively easy to apply.  I followed the directions exactly.  There is a little spatula included and I used it to take a small amount of product (it only takes a little, believe me) and put it on the back of my hand.  Then I used my fingers to "stir" the product a little and then apply it to my face.  WOW!  A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  Just remember that you can always add more but it is more difficult to take some away. Several things of note here. 1) Much, much darker than I needed 2) Coverage is total.  I mean total.  You get a flawless look.  Rather like stage makeup with which I am familiar. If that is what you want, fine.  Personally I prefer a more natural look.  If you too are looking for natural then this is not what you want. Summary---I would prefer to use a concealer or cover up just on the spots where I might need it and not go for a total coverage foundation.  That is what this is and that is what you will be getting when you order this.	-1
"Never cakey or masky" - not true.  This is very cakey and shows every line and wrinkle.  It does cover dark spots well but it looks like you are wearing stage makeup.  I like the high spf to protect from UV rays but otherwise it is not for me.	-1
Too thick and cakey, had to return it	-1
I have oily, acne-prone skin and found this product to sort of leave a film on my face. It did nothing to clear my skin, but it might be good for someone who wants a bit of exfoliation and has sensitive skin..	-1
I had heard good things about this product, but after using it- I noticed it really tangled my hair in the shower. I have pretty thick hair and I don't recall any other shampoo ever doing this to my hair. After using it, it took me quite some time to comb out all the split ends in my hair- and I am a man so I don't have super long hair.  Surprised and disappointed.	-1
I was not all that impressed with this shampoo for the price I paid for it. I like Crew better for the quality and price.	-1
Nothing great, didn't really meet my expectations for the price point. Plenty of other mens shampoo you could buy. I'll buy anthony's logistics for men before i buy this stuff.	-1
I have baby fine hair but lots of it and it's about waist length. I am not on city water and have a well with water that is not softened. I mention this because I've found that with some shampoo, the water does matter. I've had my stylist use a shampoo on me that I loved in the salon (which is on city water) but didn't like as well once I used it at home.  I used this shampoo 4 times and unfortunately every time it made my hair very "flyaway".....not frizzy exactly because I don't have enough curl in my hair for it to frizz but I found if I wanted to pull it up in a bun/ponytail, I had lots and lots of individual hairs that were unruly and wouldn't stay in the ponytail but sort of floated around my head and normally I don't have this problem with my other shampoos.  Although I loved the scent - it was sort of a minty/botanical kind of smell, I would have had to use hairspray to keep it from floating/flyaways and I hate hairspray and only use it if I absolutely have to. I also tried using other styling products to reduce the flyaways but since my hair is fine, it doesn't take much before my hair seems weighed down.  If you have hair that's not fine and have softer water then this might be a shampoo you'd like but it just wasn't for me.	-1
I was unable to get the bottle to spray - tired & tired.  Cannot put on hair any other way.	-1
Not any better than off-the-shelf hairspray. Unpleasant aroma. Used it a couple times then threw it out. Picked up a large 11oz can of TRESemm&eacute; TRES Two Hairspray at drug store for about $4 (Amazon also carries it) which has a much more pleasant aroma and works just as good.	-1
This product use to be strong and makes my hair HARD like a rock and i loved it because no one can tell that u have powder on ur F***** hair. Now for some reasons its all wet and nasty and once someone put their hands in ur hair, oh lord have mercy for the embarrassing moment that you will have. When its RAINING, please run and DO NOT AND YES I SAID DO NOT let anyone see u in that horrific, disgusting, and terrible moment. ONLY GOD KNOWS WHAT I BEEN THROUGH	-1
This is no better than any other hair spray.  Just buy some generic spray on sale at the drug store.  The Toppik fibers, hair fattener and pump attachment are really good products.	-1
It's simply a hairspray, nothing special about it. If you really think this hair spray has a different chemical to bond to the toppik better then purchase it. I would compare this hair spray with any other strong hold hair spray you can buy anywhere. I don't want to burst your bubble and say Santa don't exist. I was one of those guys dooped thinking this hair spray was different. Save your money and just use your existing hair spray. Honestly, I want my money back but I already paid for the dumb shipping and handling fee so I'm stuck with it. Anyone want a buy a used Toppik Hairspray?	-1
I applied it with a brush for a light coverage finish and found that it did not settle into my smile lines. The Bisque color blended perfectly with my skin and there is no line of demarcation between the foundation's application on my face and my neck.  This make up is cruelty free, made in Japan and is oil-free, fragrance-free, hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic. Cruelty free in Japan is an oxymoron because the Japanese are depleting our whales, etc.  Those are the pluses. Here is the big problem. Because it was so expensive, I foolishly saved it for special occasions. It dried out completely after only a few months althought I closed it properly. I contact the company's customer service only to be informed that there was nothing that could restore it or that they could do, so I have to toss it. What a disappointment!  I tried using the dried up contents of the compact it with a damp sponge, it let me apply the make-up but it felt tight on my skin just the way pancake makeup of years gone by felt.	-1
Ok cold cream. Not for the money. This brand tends to be disappointing for the price and claims.	-1
This has some quality ingredients, but I actually think this drys out my skin; weirdest thing. It takes A LOT of this moisturizer to even get close to moisturized for me. The price is sky-high. I have purchased this multiple times and have tried very hard to like this. It's time to pull the plug. FYI, I bought this direct from Jack Black, not from Amazon.com.	-1
I love almost all Jack Black stuff.  Just not this Jack Black stuff.  I am not a fan of sunscreen in moisturizers.  Maybe its me, but the feel and smell makes me think I am putting on full blown sunscreen, not a moisturizer. I have tried other similar moisturizers including sunscreen with the same result (Loreal for Men).  I know the concept behind it is supposed to be good for us, but I have just not found a product that can combine the two without the "ick" factor.	-1
I really like their shaving cream, but this was not my favorite- it is pretty greasy and the tip always gets clogged every morning with a chunk of material from the past morning.  I would say look for something else.	-1
Received a can that was half full and the cap was not sealed on the product. Very disappointed and it's an item that cannot be returned.	-1
I was kind of underwhelmed with this, yeah it's a somewhat refreshing mist spray but the price is just ridiculous for what is essentially a bottle of water. You can easily get refillable spray bottles that you pump up (commonly used as well for cooking with oils to replace products like Pam) and put spring water in them to get basically the same results.	-1
Honestly, I really don't see any effect after using it for a month. Does it really thickens the hair diameter or just temporarily coats the hair with gel to make it appear thick?  Does it really nourish the hair? Not sure how long you need to use it to see results.	-1
gluey	-1
Did nothing.	-1
Seems to help a little. Very liquidy though. Be careful or way too much comes out.	-1
Sticky, icky.	-1
I feel this product made absloutely no difference in the appearance of my hair.  Much less as it states to make my hair thicker.	-1
Does a good job at protecting from the sun, but is a cream, not a lotion, very thick. Leaves the face with a white coating, certainly with a greasy look and feel, even clumps up as if looking like your skin is peeling. Not recommended for face. These other reviews are way too kind. This sunscreen is effective, but very heavy and ere are other better options, lighter weight and with better formulas. The green tea and vitamin c in it have no effect after using for months.	-1
I returned this. Its a greasy thick white paste totally unusable unless you are a life guard or don't mind this look.	-1
This 2-inch iron is ENORMOUS, as compared to other irons/wands. I was hoping it would work great for either huge curls, loose wave/curves, or for adding body to the very top of my head. It didn't work for any of those for me bc I think it's just too big to make anything really happen with the hair other than sort of straighten/iron it with a very slight curve. My hair is down to my waist too, so I did have plenty of length to try it on...but it just didn't work at all for me. Bummer, bc it looked so fun/cool to do different things!	-1
I've used lots of glycolic pads, even stronger than these,  and yet these are the only ones that burn my skin.  I could tolerate it if they worked.	-1
Very thin pads. Hard to separate. So so.	-1
I recently tried several Jouer products after seeing a number of beauty vloggers talking about the brand. The color was a very bright, pastel pink, like Barbie pink. For me, (I'm fair with dark hair and eyes) it wasn't the most flattering color.  The formulation was the real disappointment though as it settled immediately into my lip lines (I'm 33 and don't normally have that problem) and the wear time was a joke.  It was practically gone in two hours without eating or drinking anything.	-1
I am a big fan of dermablend make up drops so I was excited for the opportunity to try this product. I had high hopes of loving this product!  The powder was a little lackluster on my skin. The powder is super very fine and includes a pufff which fluffed up very nicely. I tried applying the powder with the puff but felt like it was immediately absorbing into my skin and I couldn't really tell where the powder had been applied, so I ended up using even more. I preferred using a powder brush to apply this so I could tap off the excess powder before applying and so I could better control where it was being applied. I didn't love this powder as much as I hoped. Rather than having a silky feeling going on to my skin, it was more like matte and oil absorbing. It made my usually dewy skin feel very dry and matte and although I used the powder sparingly, it didn't blend into my make up and I felt like I had a light dusting of white on my skin. It looked a little ghostly, flat and dry. I know most powders by design are somewhat oil-absorbing but I felt like immediately absorbed into my make up as soon as I applied it more than any other traditional powder I've used.  This is the first time I have used a make-up setting spray and I didn't notice a dramatic difference using this product. It felt nice going on and did have a wide spray to cover my entire face. I was pleased that it didn't seem to smear any of my applied make up and it did seem to dry everything in place. It did leave my skin a litte flat and dry looking. Unfortunately I have very acne-prone skin and I felt like this spray flared up my acne.	-1
This product is useless.  When I use the pad that comes with it, it takes off make up as I put the powder on.  Forget waiting 2 minutes.  Foundation leaves a permanent make-up stain on the pad even after washing which tells me it really is soaking up the foundation rather than buffing it. I tried this powder several different ways: with 3 (yes 3 different Dermablend foundations I also reviewed) another brand foundation, and on skin with no make up. It works best and looks best on a make up less face.  Next it works okay with another brand's foundation.  Not as much comes off and I'm here is a little bit of glow. Finally, it does nor work at all with Dermablend foundations. That's right. The pad takes off the most make-up and has no glow with the very make up with which it should be designed to work well.  I tried using a brush made for compact powders, and it was a little better across the board.  In no scenario did my make up last any longer or prevent any more shine than using loose or compact powder from another brand.  It makes no sense to buy this compact.	-1
I like some of the derma blend line, like their concealer.  But this powder does not work for me at all.  I have dry skin & this goes on like a "bake".  You have to dust it all over your face and then brush off the excess.  This left my already dry skin, EXTREMELY dry & showed off even the finest of lines.  If you are prone to dry skin i would definitely go a more moisturized route.  This one is a huge miss for me.	-1
I really wanted to like this makeup. I've heard raving reviews about this brand and have seen their expensive products at Ulta but never tried them due to the price. I used this as directed and it's just not for me. I have very pale skin that is oily. I still felt like this left a white, powdery tint to my skin and it didn't set my make up very well.  My make up didn't last any longer than it normally does, definitely not the 16 hours that is claimed. I looked at the ingredients and all that's in it as talc. I'm not sure why a container of talc costs so much money.	-1
I got this to 'set' my liquid makeup, but this just doesn't work. It cakes up quickly and it doesn't set my face at all	-1
I was looking for a micro-fine powder to use to set my makeup.  This looked cakey on my dry skin.  I much prefer the Laura Mercier setting powder or even the $5 Elf HD powder.	-1
I actually loved this product while I was using it. It smells very medicinal and somehow 'feels' like it's killing bacteria. Unfortunately it completely dries out your skin, and is, in my opinion, WAY too harsh for acne prone skin. I've since overhauled my skin care routine once I realized that acne is caused by inflammation, and needs skin care products that CALM the skin, not strip it of all natural oils. Try using natural soaps for cleansing, and certain oils (jojoba, tamanu, etc) for moisturizing.	-1
I am still breaking out. I keep using until I run out. Not sure why I even purchased this. Thumbs down PCA	-1
I love PCA Skin.  But I have mild breakouts, more black heads and white heads and sometimes a random big zit.  I thought this would clear up my mild break outs.  Honestly I don't use it that often and my face is pretty dry.  I have oily skin but this is drying me out.  I have backed off and stopped using it. With drying out my skin am having more of a breakout more often.  So unless you have pretty bad break outs I don't recommend this.  I also use the pigmentation bar. I love this.  And I'm sticking to this one for sure.  That one helps keep my break outs at bay I think.	-1
The smell of this product smells like burnt almonds.	-1
Baffled by the positive reviews for this face wash. I guess this could work for minor acne...but it didn't make a dent in mine. I've since learned much more about the dangers of using BP, and have switched to much more gentle skin care that doesn't cause as much inflammation (raw honey, oils, etc).	-1
I don't think this made my skin worse, but I honestly can't say that I saw any difference from using it.	-1
2% Hydroquinone is the active ingredient and you can get products with this much Hydroquinone at CVS, Walmart or Walgreens.  Of course for fraction of the price.  Not to mention, it leaves a orange tint on your skin, which you will be able to see if you are using it alone.  Will not buy again.	-1
Doesnt work	-1
These just really didn't work for me. I have diffuse thinning--not the worst out there, but quite noticeable. Sprinkling the fibers just caused them to kind of bunch up and clump, so it was really obvious there was something unsavory going on on my scalp. If you sweat a little bit or scratch your head, the fibers will really turn into clumps. I'm glad this works for other people, but I don't really want anyone to be able to tell that I'm hiding my thin hair behind some powder.	-1
This might work well for others, but this brand made my scalp incredibly irritated.  Also, the color has a greenish tinge, which was NOT the look I was going for.  Nanogen and Cobuki have worked better for me.	-1
I got this in light brown.  I have slight hair loss from a medication I was taking, at my crown.  This looks like dirt, & sucks the shine from my hair wherever it falls.  The color is not even remotely brown or light brown.  More grayish black brown. I gave it 2 stars because I like the shake it on container.	-1
It's like sprinkling salt or pepper on your head and expecting it to look like hair...Don't bother purchasing.	-1
the container is too small ,,, it is much smaller then the applicator, so i cannot use it at all	-1
OK THE REASON I AM GIVING TOPPIK ONE STAR IS BECAUSE I BEEN BUYINGTHIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME AND I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. IT USE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET. NOW, THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT IN THE MARKET. LATELY AFTER U PUT THE MEDIUM BROWN IN UR HAIR AND THEN U PUT THE SPRAY ON TOP OF IT, YOUR HAIR BECOMES PURPLE ON THE AREA WHERE UR HAIR IS THINNING BUT THE REST STAYS BROWN AND IT LOOKS GROSS AND DISGUSTING. I CALLED THE MANUFACTURE AND I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER AND I SENT THEM PICTURES, THEY RESPONDED SAYING THAT THE BOTTLE THAT I BOUGHT MUST BE DMAGED AND THEY SENT ME A NEW ONE. I GAVE THEM A CHANCE AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND OH LORD IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!! I WENT AND I BOUGHT NEW BOTTLE FROM SALLY BEAUTY AND IT WAS THE SAME THING. THATS ITTTTTTTTTT. I AM NOT BUYING THIS RODUCT EVER AGAIN	-1
Makes the spot you are covering look dry and dull.  Not a natural look. I will not buy this again.	-1
Saw on Dr. Oz so ordered it. Very disappointed though. Did not fill in at all. Made no difference. Would return if it wasn't such a hassle.	-1
Color is way lighter then posted.	-1
For a few more dollars I could've gotten a much BIGGER bottle!!!!!!!! Content amount is Not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a rip off to buy this item for that amount	-1

I have ordered Toppik before and it must have been the real thing because it worked better. This one is like dust and doesn't look like hair at all. I recommend trying another product on Amazon. Perhaps the price has something to do with this but it is not the Toppik brand and does not work as well.	-1
I think the color did not match my hair correctly.  If I order another one, it will probably be the medium brown instead of the light brown.	-1
shows like I have put dried mustard in my hair. After a couple of hours, it's gone. Will not try again.	-1
It takes too long to cover the patches. The colour was too dark for brown. It was like black. It cannot be used for large areas of baldness.	-1
I have some thinning in my part, and have been using Joan River's Great Hair Day for years. It gives a slight itch sometimes but is easy to brush on and gives full coverage. I bought the Toppik after reading reviews of no itch and how it works better than Great Hair Day. I kept shaking it on my head and it didn't look like the powder even came out. Then I slowly see a pile of powder forming on my hair, and I had to mix it in with my fingers. I even tried using the Great Hair Day brush, to no avail - the brush didn't pick up on the Toppik powder. I used the Toppik applicator for parts which I bought seperately, but that didn't work well either. I'm back to using Great Hair Day and the Toppik is sitting ignored in my closet.	-1
My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product! Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place. Instead of boosting his confidence, Toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair.	-1

I didn't like this product at ALL.  It clumped when I put it on.  I will never buy it again.	-1
I'm in my early 30's and have a receding hairline. You ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with linty hair? That's exactly how I would describe the texture when you use this on your hair. I purchased color black with the pump sprayer, pick/comb, and their hairspray. I accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple. It takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of Toppik sprayed only onto the hair. No matter how perfect your results come out, up real close you can notice something different and I'm sure under the direct sunlight it's probably 10X more noticeable. Toppik claims that people can't even notice 2 inches away, that's bull. This is definitely a better product than Couvre the scalp concealer. Toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray, absolutely nothing advanced or special about it. The comb is a piece of crap, made out of cheap paper/plastic not even worth a quarter! Go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb. Toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat, wind, and any objects & elements disrupting the do. The money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it. I rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction. Maybe if you're in your 60's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you, but I still think people are over paying for a product that doesn't promise what they claim. I'm currently trying a product called NuHair. I'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum. I'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months. There are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so I'm going to commit to this NuHair program for 5-6 months and hope for the best. Figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment. If the natural way fails then Rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant. Bottom line, my girlfriend thinks I wasted my money on this product (toppik) and I'm going to have to agree with her on this. Hope you guys learn from my mistake. If you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area CA let me know. Good luck fellas.	-1
smell and taste like very artificial jasmine, not pleasnt jasmine favor. Can't not return it either. I don't feel anything special after using it. Not worth the price. I wish i could return it.	-1
Didn't like the flavor and texture of it, felt old/dry	-1
For me this tasted of something sweet AND something foul. I personally didn't enjoy it at all. It's definitely unique but try to find a small one if you can first.	-1
Bought it on basis of reviews.  I will just use it as I have it now. But will not buy a new one.  No, nothing wrong with it.  But did not find anything special about it either. Will try another after shave balm later, after this one is used up.	-1
I got this hairbrush after years of lusting after it (yet not being able to justify to myself why one should spend so much on something like this). After seeing a recent onslaught of glowing comments about Mason Pearson products on sites like Into the Gloss, etc., I decided it would be worth the cost. I did select the kind that was designed for my hair type (long and fine, but lots of it). I am sorry to say that this hairbrush makes my hair all static-y and fluffy, and the bristles aren't long enough/straight enough to get all the way through my hair,so I would have to brush it in sections, which is kind of ludicrously time-consuming for so simple an act. However, the product is beautiful, as is the packaging, and it will look lovely lying around on my dressing table. Unless you're going for the status-symbolism element, I would say that, unfortunately, this item as a utilitarian product falls a bit short.	-1

I have other Zoya colors that I like as well as the application. This color looks nothing like what appears on my screen or what is described. There is absolutely no pink tone. I would say it is closer to a yellowish beige. Very unattractive. I can't imagine this would look good on anyone.	-1

Too many large glitter pieces, just looks clumpy and cant smooth even with many top coats. Who wants lumpy nails?	-1
Great Color but Chips very quickly.	-1
I usually love Zoya, but the black is the worst black I have ever bought in my entire life, and I wear a LOT of black nail polish. It's opaque, which makes it look really gross without multiple coats, but it's also drippy and tacky for a REALLY long time if you do thick enough coats for it to actually be black instead of a nasty watery grey. Just terrible. Would return it if it were worth the trouble. I did my nails this MORNING and it's already chipping.	-1
Very thin, streaks and dries slowly, slowly	-1
Don't order, awful, hooky, threw it out as it could not be replaced	-1

See the pictures of how yellow my nails still look? I used this product AND the pink perfector!! The tips of my nails are still yellow! I was pretty excited about this product because since I am a nail polish addict, I was hoping this item would get rid of discoloration but it didn't. Oh and I also used the satin seal on top. I see no change in my nails and will never purchase any of the Zoya Naked Nail line again!	-1
Every nail polish I own is by Zoya and I love their products. I've legitimately spent so much money on their brand and, overwhelmingly, their products have been great -- but this is really the worst top coat imaginable. It takes longer to dry than the nail polish underneath it. Hours later, it still gets deep dents. I'm surprised someone said that this will level out streaky polishes underneath it, because for me, it definitely doesn't. The time before this I used it, it also left tiny bubbles on the surface of the nail, between the coloured polish and the top of the base coat. It goes on looking deceptively fine and then just creates nail disasters. For me, it didn't cause polish to shrink away from the tip (which is great) and initially provided a fair amount of sheen, but  I'm looking down at the nails I did yesterday and they're absolutely covered in dents. I used the top coat to help prevent the colour getting nail marks and whatnot while I slept. It honestly looks 100 times worse with the top coat than it does when you just apply nail polish, wait a while, and then go to bed. This top coat's truly terrible. I've been looking for a cruelty free top coat and less hazardous alternative to products with toulene and things like that. This one is just a massive fail, though. I love you, Zoya, but I don't know what you were thinking with this one!	-1
What a disappointment. Did nothing to strengthen nails. Polish chipped after half a day. Sadly, I have nothing good to say about this one.	-1

I was expecting a nice pink color, but what you get is especially a nude polish. I will probably not  buy polish online without seeing it in person in the future.	-1
My primary polish is OPI, but I thought I would try something new without chemicals.  This polish is thick, clumpy and does not last or shine like OPI!	-1
This is gray, not gray green, just gray. Not as described or pictured. Not eligible for return. Buyer beware.	-1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.	-1
I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.	-1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...	-1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.	-1
Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.	-1

Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple	-1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.	-1
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..	-1
Extremely light!	-1
For some reason when i put this nail polish on it goes on with a matte finish and looks weird. I feel like when i bought it that it had been tampered with before. None of my other essie colors that i've bought from a store has done that.	-1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(	-1
Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.	-1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray	-1
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money	-1
The first coat was too thin and watery!	-1
Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy	-1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails	-1
Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.	-1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.	-1
The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's "Play Date." This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.	-1
I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than "Butler, Please". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of "Butler, Please" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.	-1
Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes	-1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.	-1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.	-1
First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!	-1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.	-1
I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".	-1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.	-1
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.	-1
I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.  I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.	-1
I really loved the color, and that's why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.	-1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!	-1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.	-1
I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.	-1
I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed	-1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could	-1
I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!	-1
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.	-1
I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!	-1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!	-1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...	-1
I love this color (and many of Essie's colors), but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it's unusable.	-1
I was excited to receive, but it is watered down and is not the real thing.  It came out matte and runny.  I was extremely disappointed.	-1
this nail polish, although Essie brand, is horrible quality. I don't know if it's the manufacturer or the distributor, but it went on like paint thinner, no shine, chipped after a day, very flat. I do not recommend.	-1
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.	-1
It's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque. I'm super disappointed!!!! I was so excited only to be extremely let down. Awful formula, do not buy. Even over white it just looked ugly and messy.	-1
This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.	-1
I was expecting a nice pink color, but what you get is especially a nude polish. I will probably not  buy polish online without seeing it in person in the future.	-1
When applied, this looks horrible and watery...nothing like when purchased in a store. I would not recommend buying these online. Very disappointed.	-1
The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color	-1
My primary polish is OPI, but I thought I would try something new without chemicals.  This polish is thick, clumpy and does not last or shine like OPI!	-1
Smells good thought it was cleaning well but maybe making my hair feel a little dry now it's 4 days later and my head is REALLy REALLY itchy I have to stop using this now. Never had a problem with itchy scalp before.	-1
3c/4a coil curls.  It has a pleasant, neutral scent. It smells like baby to me. It is clear and gel-like. That's all that I like about it, really.  I tried this on a large section of my own hair before putting it on my whole head. I do this for any new hair product to make sure it won't dry out my whole head if my hair does not like it. That is exactly what happened with this particular shampoo. I only used the tiniest amount, and focused it all on my scalp. When I rinse, I let the shampoo rinse over my hair while rubbing my scalp clean, so that I don't use too much product on my curls. I could immediately tell my hair was drying out. I didn't like the feeling. I checked in the mirror ad my curls were dry. I immediately co washed with a conditioner.  I am returning this bottle to Ulta, where I purchased from. I would love to keep it since I like the scent and consistency, but if using such a small amount and only focusing on my scalp dries out my hair that much, it is not worth it.  *Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paulmitchell(dot)com lists. Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.	-1
3c/4a coily curls.  This conditioner is lackluster. I used a dime-sized amount on a decent sized section of clean, damp hair (how I always condition). It did not give me much slip. I finger detangled and that wasn't very productive with this conditioner. I then detangled with a comb to see if it is good for that. The comb glided through, but I suspect only because I had already finger-detangled. I would honestly have to do another test to see its detangling capabilities, but I won't bother because it didn't even condition my hair.  It did not condition my hair at all. I left it on for 10 or so minutes before rinsing with cool water. My curls were not at all defined or decently moisturized. It was disappointing, because I love other PM products (The Conditioner, Awapuhi Mist), which have left my hair conditioned, moisturized, and beautiful. After rinsing this detangler out I followed up with a cowash with Herbal Essences Hydralicious, which defines my hair and leaves it well moisturized.  The only positive thing I can say about this is the scent. It is neutral, and smells like baby powder to me. I like neutral scents because of my sensitive nose to fragrance. The consistency is medium-thick, and it is yellow in color.  I am returning this bottle to Ulta, where I purchased from.  *Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paul mitchell's website lists. Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.	-1
Smells nice but does not give a good shave. Was left with shaving rash and bumps. Used all my normal razors that work fine with other creams. Will not repurchase.	-1
Not worth the money or claim. Tried a lot from this line and all the products are disaplionting. Especially for the claim of less chemicals which are actually in them.	-1
I don't care for the scent (smells a bit like insect repellent), but it's gentle and effective. UPDATE: Every time I use this on my 2yr old, she gags & coughs a LOT.  Neither of us can stand the strong smell, so it's useless to us regardless of its effectiveness.	-1
Maybe  missing something??  I thought I would splurge and get a great dryer for shiny hair and faster drying....  Hmmmmm...  Its not any better than my old clogged up cheapie dryer...  And it doesnt get very hot.  What am I missing??	-1
I've used lots of glycolic pads, even stronger than these,  and yet these are the only ones that burn my skin.  I could tolerate it if they worked.	-1
Very thin pads. Hard to separate. So so.	-1
I have a "no frills" hairstyle (long, naturally straight and fine) that can air-dry and still look okay.  Therefore, I have never been one to spend a lot of money on styling tools.  I bought this very basic, inexpensive hair dryer since I normally don't have time for air-drying.  It worked "okay" for the past 2 years--it dried my hair in about 10 minutes but left lots of little frizzes on top that I would then have to smooth out with an iron.  It just met the bare minimum requirements for a hair dryer, nothing more.  I cleaned the lint filter regularly and only used it a few times a week.  I was therefore surprised when it shot out sparks and smoke while using it yesterday morning.  I carefully unplugged it and disposed of it.  I have always heard that with hairdryers, you actually do get what you pay for but I wasn't too concerned with it.  However, since the performance of this hairdryer was nothing special and it didn't last very long, I guess it is time for at least a modest upgrade with my next hairdryer.  I am wishing now I had just bought a nicer one to begin with as I will be out the same amount of money, having to replace it so soon.	-1
The dryer not so bad but the filter on the back and the directional nozzle WILL NOT STAY ON!  I mean really will not stay on.  So frustrating.  Don't buy this!  I stupidly tried it only once waiting for my current one to die completely and now I missed the window to return.  Ugh.	-1
We ordered this as a Christmas gift on the recommendation of our stylist.  She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer.  However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting.  We will need to return it.	-1
I understand the concept of creating a spa line for men. I respect that. This body wash could be used by a man or woman. The scent is bad. It reminds me of cheap imitation perfumes. it actually gave me a headache. It does clean the body. Other than that, I do not have anything good to say about it.	-1
I expect soaps to have some lather, but this just seemed to kind of disappear when I rubbed my hands together to work up a lather.  I found it best to pump the soap onto my hands, then rub onto my skin without trying to make a lather.  I think this body wash still got me clean, but it was weird to not see any lathering.  The scent is a bit on the feminine-side as it has a light floral smell.  Not unappealing or lingering, but definitely noticeable.	-1
Niticed no difference, expensive	-1
I used this for a good 6 months before deciding it doesnt do diddly. I make my own eye serum that is more effective at fading dark circles than this. And more moisturizing and lifting too. For a lot less money. Pass.	-1
I am extremely prone to breakouts, which is why I have to use oil free lotions on my face. Not all oil-free lotions prevent my skin from breaking out, though. This is by far the thickest oil-free lotion I've ever put on my face. I liked it and hoped that it would work for me, but after two days, I started breaking out. I had to stop using it. I gave it to my sister who loves it, so it really depends on your skin.	-1
My impression this was a natural skin care product.  It was not clear at the time it is designed for men.  This product contains parabens which are potentially cancer causing.  I would not use it for this reason and threw it away.	-1
I was expecting something...better. For the price and the hype I thought it would leave my lips super moisturized, maybe looking healthier, more plump. Nothing! It was heavy and sticky.	-1
I've used a variety of lip balms and hydration solutions, and I found this one to be sub-par.  It felt heavy on my lips, and didn't seem to sink in like other treatments.  It also felt sticky.  After about half an hour I ended up wiping this off, because it felt like it just sat on my lips.  As far as moisturizing lip treatments go, I'll stick to Fresh's Sugar line.  It's more expensive, but works so much better.	-1
Red Door puts Poison & Giorgio to shame. One spray will do or it will announce your arrival before you.  It opens with honey-drenched white florals. Morphs into a rose, just a bit soapy, eventually a bit powdery. Takes a long time to dry down. Pleasant & wearable for me ... in about 2 hours.  If you like extravagant florals, this one might be for you. I'm glad I opened the red door but I doubt that I'll do it again. I'm gonna keep this red door closed. However, I love this version:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Red-Door-Velvet-By-Elizabeth-Arden-For-Women-Eau-De-Parfum-Spray-3-3-Ounce-Bottle/dp/B000VOPG9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Red Door Velvet By Elizabeth Arden For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.3-Ounce Bottle</a>	-1
I was feeling nostalgic when I ordered my bottle of Calvin Klein Obsession.  I used to LOVE the scent and wanted to throw it into my perfume mix again.  I was so excited to open the package, so I sprayed it on my wrists immediately!  I took a huge whiff and was quite surprised.  It still has that incredible dreamy smell of Obsession, but it also had an alcohol and chemical smell.  At first I wondered what I was thinking when I was younger that I would wear this.  Then I read some reviews and discovered that the formula had been sold.  I understand companies try to find cheaper ways to make products so they can make more money.  However, I wonder if they took into account the amount of customers they would lose because of this change?!?!!?  How disappointing!!!!	-1
Billy Jealousy has a "bad boy" reputation. That must mean, "Boy, this stuff hurts badly."  Shaved Ice contains some good stuff -- aloe and oils -- but it burned my face. I was tired of going to work with the dry, burning sensation that B.J.S.I causes, so I discarded the remaining 60 percent left in my bottle.  It clearly is a well-regarded product line, but it is no good for my sensitive skin. I'll look elsewhere for a good after-shave balm.	-1
The BaByliss that I previously had was so much smaller but it threw so much heat and air. I loved it. The cord was a good 10 feet long, which made using it awesome, I could stand in my hall way to make sure the dogs were not getting into trouble.  This BaByliss is so much heavier, I can barely hold it away from my head. I get tired holding it in one hand. I can barely dry one hair strand before having to switch sides. I have to keep going back and forth to dry.  The rubberized grip is so slippery. After getting out of the shower and using lotion or hair products, holding this super heavy hair dryer is so hard. It keeps wanting to slip out of my grip and I'm nervous I'll drop it.  It definitely has enough air flow. It really blows out and it seems to get my hair dry faster than my old BaByliss. The heaviness and worrying is too stressful.  I love the BaByliss but this one is not the right one for me.	-1
I am a big fan of the PCA line, it has been the only thing to work on my adult acne (mainly the A&c serum, BPO cleanser and nutrient toner). However, I have been using this product for over a month and I do not see any change on the lines under my eyes. I am so used to having fast results with their products that I expected to see some kind of change after the first month. What I can say about this product is that as small as it is I still have A LOT left,PCA products can be expensive but they do last a long time. I will write another review on my third or fourth month.  UPDATE I am a big fan of PCA skin products and I had to update this review because I really believe I was sold an expired toner and other PCA products. I stopped buying PCA products on amazon after comparing them to the ones I bought with my dermatologist or @skinstore.com. I noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products I bought on amazon where different and where able to come off. Sadly I can't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore.com or skinstore.com will not even give a small discount on PCA products (PCA products are always excluded from promotions). The A&C serum I bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have  the newer (better quality) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump. With that said choose the vendor carefully.	-1
Used products for 5 yrs. Not one of my favorites.	-1
Would be a fine toothpaste if it wasn't so expensive. Not worth the price.	-1
Doesn't look right when I apply it.	-1
I was convinced that I was going to love "Fresh Frog of Belair" because I love Kermit and I love OPI. I was sorely disappointed. I had used "Gone Gonzo" and apart from its difficulty of removal I did think that it was a pretty color, but even though this is the "same" line, the formula is not similar enough to make this a great polish.  Like "Gone Gonzo," "Fresh Frog of Belair" is a clear polish with green microglitter and large silver glitter in it. It took SEVEN coats of this polish to cover my nails, and the coverage is still not good. It looks like a cheap drugstore polish and does not cover the edges of my nail or the tips. It looks like I have been digging in gravel and the manicure is brand new. Like other OPI polishes that have this large silver glitter, the ends of my nails were sharp enough to score glass and I had to file them after they were polished. I had to use two coats of Seche Vite topcoat to make the polish smooth enough not to catch on denim, and these NINE layers of polish will take a full thirty minutes to remove, even when using pure acetone.  The color of the microglitter is a bright, leafy green. The glitter is the same color that you can get in the cheap glitter for arts and crafts that you buy at the grocery store. It is not a deep green, has a yellow undertone, and the silver glitter all but disappears and looks like clear spots in the polish. My boyfriend was not impressed.  I don't recommend this color. "Gone Gonzo" and "Gettin' Miss Piggy With It" would be better options from the Muppets collection. There are far better greens available from OPI.	-1
I always, always go by the Stila displays and admire their products. Their packaging, their colors, they attract me! I like their waterproof liquid eyeliners, for example.  This pencil seemed so creamy when I swatched it, I could just imagine how smoothly it was going to go onto my lid, and how it surely must look amazing! I didn't notice when that swatch on my hand looked all smeary before I left the store....it was too late anyway, I had the pencil in my bag.  Love the packaging, but just...d*mn. YO ADRIAN! LOOK AT MY BLACK EYES! This pencil was incredible, it made the smoothest line, so rich and deep and perfect! And then apparently I breathed, and it made the product go crazy running and sticking. I put this on before work, and I made the mistake of putting it under my eyes, and it wasn't long before I noticed some customers glancing upwards at my eyes in a funny way. As soon as I could get to a mirror, I was horrified to see just how badly this stuff spreads. I looked like Courtney Love on the Comedy Central Pamela Anderson roast! It didn't look any better as I took a kleenex and tried to do damage-control, it may run but it leaves behind a stain. OMG.  The top lash line didn't really look any better by the end of the day, it looked greasy and melty like an ice cream cone left on the dash of a car. Just NOT a good product for me. Even with primer, there was NO stopping the meltdown this product had. Not a repurchase and I would not recommend it. I returned it to the store as soon as I could and the clerk said they have a lot of returns on this product.	-1
I like JB products and am a big fan of the Dragon Ice, so I tried one of these. I have older, sensitive, dry skin. A pea sized dab massaged across my face resolved nothing and felt like sticky film nearly all day. A few days later I tried a bigger coin-sized glob and massaged it across my entire face with the same results. Sticky, tacky feeling all day! I elected to wash it off several hours later and had slimy feeling which dissolved with more water. Apparently, my skin is not absorbing this stuff like it does the Nivea/Neutrogena types. The JB gel smells okay and feels okay gong on, but I will not be continuing its use.	-1
Nothing special. It dries up my skin. Not for me.	-1
Smells wonderful. However it irritated my hands , arms, chest, neck . Everywhere I put this thing on gave me pimples . Do not waste your money.	-1
This color was fine as a bright alternative to my usual look.  It goes on paler than in the pan and is a great color for fuschia lipsticks. But it streaked like crazy on me.  I also hated the packaging.  Somehow the compact is really hard to open.  Not a keeper.	-1
Bought this product to soothe slight redness and irritation from using acne creams, as it is highly recommended on paulaschoice.com (which I'm coming to find out is quite biased!) Haven't noticed any difference or improvement from this product other than leaving the skin soft and slightly moisturized, never greasy. No changes in irritation or redness, certainly no changes in anti aging or wrinkles. Okay product. Not the best. Elemis pro collagen serum is way better I would have to say.	-1
Calvin Klein's Eternity just isn't for me.  It does have a floral smell, but it's harsh.  After wearing it for a while, I felt like taking a shower.  I kept it onto see if it would change over time.  While it did mellow out some it still wasn't appealing to me.  I know that some people have a different body chemistry, so I tried just wearing it on my clothes.  It actually was even less appealing that way.  My husband and my daughter didn't like it either.  I know that this is a beloved fragrance, but it is not for me.	-1
Calvin Klein Eternity was a fragrance I used quite regularly in the mid 1990's.  I was so happy to receive a sample to test for review and revisit an old friend.  Unfortunately this is not the same fragrance I remember.  The original Eternity was a distinctive sexy, clean, floral scent that is hard to forget.  This new formula is musky, masculine and made me nauseous after wearing it for a few minutes. I had to take a shower to lose this scent and feel better. This had me curious enough to research this further, after all maybe its just me.  Perhaps I don't remember the scent or my body chemistry has changed. Nope, turns out this was sold to Coty in 2005 and the formula was changed.  Anyone searching for the original Eternity will need to search for vintage bottles for sale. I'm very disappointed in the changes to the one time beautiful scent.  I can't wear this, I no longer like the scent and I certainly don't want to feel sick all day.	-1
I've been so tempted to buy this here. What's not to love? The spaceship bottle is awesome and the price is right. Thankfully, I managed to find a sample first.  Tocade surprised me. Some people say Tocade is dated, and I have to agree, at least at the opening.  Complex? Not to me - just too much going on to make out any structure, theme or notes. It's a muddled, sweet mess on me, probably due to the deadly mix of jasmine, LOV and freesia, which I infrequently wear well. Yah, I catch the amber-vanilla base, but there's too much going on otherwise in this cloying, sweet, white floral.  Rose? Orchid? Orris? Magnolia? Really?  As it dries, Tocade is almost hysterically sweet and on the edge of cloying. Tocade seems to be the mother to Roucel's other over-the-top sweeties, like Lolita Lempicka's L & Coral and Dunhill Desire for Woman. Of these, I can tolerate Dunhill Desire. Hardly a ringing endorsement. Yet, I'm growing quite fond of Roucel's other affordable masterpieces - Oro & L'Instant.  I've been tempted by good prices on the spaceship bottle, and I'm so glad I didn't blind buy this one. I don't like this. Not. At. All.  Try it before you buy it.	-1
Long story short.  This stuff doesn't really smell very nice to me or to my girlfriend.  It smells like old people.  So, if you are an old person who want to smell like an old person, this might be right up your alley.  But otherwise, regretfully, I'd recommend that you skip this one.  Great bottle just a shame that what's inside doesn't do it justice.  Not good.  2 stars.	-1
When I read the description of this perfume, I thought it sounded so yummy.  It isn't.  The only thing the description got right was that it smelled of amber.  I was excited when I opened the box and pulled out this beautiful bottle, filled with a perfume the color of honey.  I opened the lid, took a sniff, and WOW it smelled just awful!  Still, I thought, it may smell better on.  It didn't.  It reeks.  It smelled so bad I had to jump in the shower and throw my clothes in the washer to get that smell away from my nose and to avoid offending other noses.	-1
It doesn't smell like cologne. It honestly smells like sandalwood and moth balls. I used it for a couple days to see if it would get better but it didn't	-1
I found out two things upon trying this the other day. First, it is very powerful. After two short squirts, two rooms in my apartment were bathed in the scent for a good hour. Secondly, upon smelling it, my 18 year old daughter said that it reminded her of my father, her grandfather. I felt the same way. It's heavy on the musk and very strong. Neither of those are my choice qualities in a men's fragrance.  Currently, I use Hugo Boss Energise and Karen Low Black. They are both clean and fresh smelling, which I prefer, plus a bit unique, which is also nice to not smell like everyone else. To each his own, and I relay my personal preferences as a point of comparison for your own.	-1
Smells like the 70s.	-1
Break out from HELL - worse than a hormonal teenager!	-1
I use this creme often and I buy it from amazon. It is one of the few products I really love and agrees with my skin. However, the texture and smell of the last jar I bought from this seller is completely different from the normal ones. I can tell almost immediately that the product does not act the same on my skin. I have had one other experience similar and amazon returned it.	-1
This just colors the eyebrow hair. It doesn't really fill anything in	-1
I did not like this pencil.  Does not glide on smoothly.	-1
Chalky pencil .. Not smooth on the eye.  THE color is not a saturated tone.  .	-1
Okay I rarely give 1-star reviews, but this is the pits. I wanted to find a peachy and/or white eyeliner highlifhter to make my eyes appear more "awake". At first I thought peach was the way to go, however it seems more makeup artists use a white, and when I found this, it seemed like the best of both worlds, plus it's a more natural makeup line...  It stinks. It is sooooo hard to apply, nearly impossible. What I mean by this is that I need to press hard to get the color to come off, and on my eyelid, this is near impossible and I end up just irritating my eyes. It is as though it is actually too hard packed into the stick, not smooth enough, I cant explain it other than that. I hate this.	-1
I've used bioelements for a while. I am familiar with the packaging and the seal. The seal on this was different than normal. I was just replacing a previous one that had run out also purchased on amazon. The seal was different than any of the numerous ones I've used. As well the texture and smell was different. Oddly I started developing weird dry patches and itchiness. I didn't put this together until I ran out the other day and I was substituting with my other products. The dryness is going away. I just received another jar from a different vendor that was the normal seal. I contacted amazon at the time about what I noticed and they assured me it had to be right. But well...moral of the story if you are familiar with the product trust your instinct and ask for a replacement.	-1
did not realize it was frosted, I wanted matte	-1
The product feels creamy and spread easily. It does seem to make my eye area look a little better. I felt no burning or irritation from it. I can't get past the strong perfume scent it has though. It is terrible, I really don't understand why these companies have to put this kind of scent into skin products, it is very irritating and I will not buy something like this that has a perfume scent. This product also pills which I find unacceptable in any type of skin cream. Some people seem to love it but I don't. This is my personal experience, yours might be different.	-1
Not for me, didn't see what the most of the reviews say. I have curly and freeze hair. I use a professional dryer and my hair looks better without this product. I don't like the smell. I threw it away	-1
I've used these capsules for a month now and am overwhelmingly disappointed with the results.  The capsules are filled with thick, clogging oils that smell a bit off. I've noticed no results from the product except its unmatched ability to clog my pores.  Absolutely advise against using this if you have combination skin. I feel Elemis is heavily marketing this product because its unqiue and can generate high profits due to its absurd price. Consider purchasing natural flower/herbal oils instead. I do not trust these reviews posted and suspect a marketing campaign behind it.	-1
I bought this on recommendation since I was having issues starting out shaving with a DE razor.  It's not unscented, it has a "musky" scent.  I haven't found a difference between shaving with a Pre-Shave oil and Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus & Menthol and with just the Proraso.  I spent a lot of money for this and I think it was a bad investment.	-1
Another one of my least favorite preshaves. Entirely too sticky for me... It leaves a nasty ring of shaved hair around the sink after the water drains, even when using a little bit. I prefer something between the runny splashes out there... and this glue product.	-1
Really unimpressive. The design looks like it could be high end, and fitting of the high price tag. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The clippers have rough, sharp edges that make this uncomfortable to hold and to handle. The clipper itself is not very strong, so it's not effective on thick nails. At the very least, you'd think they would have made a nice case that it would fit in but it's really just a rough leather sleeve. The clippers are hard to put in the case and it's really not a good fit at all. To add insutl to injury, these clippers are made in China. I'm sure I could do better with most drugstore clippers.	-1
I had hopes for this, slick and a small companion for travel.  It has one job, to cut nails and cuticles.  It tears nails and cuticles.  Every once in a while, it cuts okay, but no better than okay.  This is a worthless product.	-1
Okay, this clipper is for nails on your finger. It does not work on toenails. When you try pressing the clipper, it does not cut the toenail. I am disappointed.  Don't tell me that my toenails are tough to break. I have cheap clipper, from dollar store, that works on both finger nails and toenails. Come on. Have you tested your product on toenails?	-1
I returned this upon first glance. The head is huge and to shave with it must be like shaving with a scoop shovel. Clearly when it comes to shaving less is more. Company's, if you really want to corner the market design the size of the razor heads smaller, smaller, smaller!	-1
Dries my ski out too bad	-1
Excited to try it based on reviews, but find it to be a poor cleanser. Little baby acne since starting using this, very dry skin, and my face looks dirty right after shower. I will just stick to a dove for men soap bar as it is far superior for cleaning the face and making it look nice and clean. Way overpriced for what you get, but everyone is different. What doesn't work for me might work for you.  Side note: I find Jack Black products to be extremely overpriced when they all seem to be mediocre products	-1
This small bottle of skin cream has a retail price of $365.  I am an esthetician and I wanted to try the product.  Before even using it, I checked out the list of ingredients and that raised a question mark in my mind why would this product cost so much when it has 2 types of parabens in it.  Here is the list of ingredients: Water (Aqua), Pentaerythrityl Tetracaprylate/Tetracaprate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propylene Glycol, C12-20 Acid PEG-8 Ester, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Glycerin, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Glyceryl Stearate, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract, Dimethicone, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Linoleate, Leontopodium Alpinum Extract, Artemia Extract, Ursolic Acid, Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine, Sodium Carboxymethyl Beta-Glucan, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Allantoin, Cetyl Phosphate, Carbomer, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Ceratonia Siliqua Gum, Glyceryl Linolenate, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Oleanolic Acid, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Polyacrylamide, Laureth-7, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Fragrance (Parfum), Linalool, Limonene, Coumarin, Geraniol, alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.  As one can see there are so many artificial ingredients in this product, that can make one dizzy.  As excited as I was that this product contains amaranth, artemis flower, rosemary, pea, sage, mango and shea butter it also contains methylparaben and ethylparaben.  For anyone allergic to the fragrance, a note that this product dies contain fragrance.  Product provides a lot of moisture on the skin and it absorbs well without leaving residue.  It is perfect for using underneath the make up.  But the other weakness of this product is that it does not have SPF so one should apply SPF on top of this crme.  Would I buy this product? No.  And it is not just because of the price, but because it contains parabens that are harmful to some people.  I would also not recommend this product to my clients for the exact same reasons.	-1
I have used LA Medical, IS Clinical, Pharmagel, Skin Ceuticals, and a variety of other luxury brands, currently and in the past. As well as formulated my own after extensive study in cosmetic chemistry, herbalist, formulation and clinical aromatherapy.  After trying for a week, I didn't notice much difference.  Just a few notes about some ingredients, many of which can be found in most face moisturizers.  Moisturizes / hydrates / protects due to the Glyceryl Linolenate, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Glycerin, Shea butter, and Mango butter)  Goes on smooth and skin conditioning and (Pentaerythrityl Tetracaprylate/Tetracaprate, Oleanolic Acid, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, sage and rosemary leaf extracts)  Slightly fragrant (mainly due to Fragrance Parfum, Linalool, Limonene, Coumarin, and Geraniol)  Use of Artemia Extract (zooplankton-extracted from brine shrimp), is becoming popular for anti-aging creams. First, its animal based. Second, used to protect skin from extreme thermal stress like cold temperatures or UV Rays. Third, there is really little to no information on it other than it appears to be in a few luxury products.  Most of the other ingredients include emulsifiers, preservatives, chelating agents, antioxidants, anti-aging, etc.  Now, about the use of parabens, I would expect given the trend of moving away from these types of preservatives that a product of this price and quality would approach a more main stream stance of replacing them.  Just a bit odd for me that the ingredients on the box don't match what is on the website. For example, the box states it contains Methylparaben, butylparaben and proxypaparben while the website states Methylparaben and Ethylparaben.  Over, its a very nice moisturizer and hydrating facial cream, but at the price point of $365 for 1.7oz, it is very over priced compared to other facial creams and ingredients in the luxury category. And the environmental working group database did not give it high marks due to use of ingredtnts such as Fragrance, Triethanolamine, BHT, Polyacrylamide, Phenoxyethanol, and Methylparaben.	-1
It is greasy and makes my undereye bags look worse. I have tried using one color, or two. Wish I would have returned it!	-1
This item was not in the book.  There were there be two items one at $40 came  This did not come......It $30...as the other as of writing ....the Concealer	-1
Lasts and works well to conceal without causing obvious white/light circles under eyes or wherever it is applied. HOWEVER, I found that it settles in wrinkles and creases EXCESSIVELY.  I was constantly having to smooth under my eyes (every hour at least) because of this.  I have switched to a Lancome concealer (in a tube) and have zero problems with coverage and NO creasing.  I'm using the Jane Iredale above to cover vein spots on my legs but no longer use it on my face.  :(  Will not purchase again!	-1
This concealer didn't work for me.  It is too thick, even when I warmed it up between two fingers. The ingredients don't allow for the best kind of coverage.  It always looks thick, even when blended on the face. It is also very greasy- probably because of all the oils in it.  I just doesn't have staying power-  especially if used around the eyes.	-1
Creases like crazy!	-1
After 5 days i got a rash on my face and i had to stop it . 20% is way tooo strong to be used everydays . I think you can only use it twice a week . The body cream did the same and i had to put cortisone . Its a good cream but have to be carefull	-1
This was way expensive and doesn't really do anything for me in any way. My skin seems to break out when using it more than when I use something else and the scent is a bit too strong as well. Basically, it's only a mediocre cleanser with no benefit to the skin.  I regret my purchase and feel I wasted my money. I have since relegated this to use as hand soap by refilling my hand soap jars with it  so as not to waste it. The bottle should last me several years when used this way.	-1
Dries my skin out really bad	-1
Ive been using this for a few weeks.  Im not really a fan.  The grit is WAY too large.  Ive used several other brands of face scrub.  Some have a lot of grit. . . . some not so much. . . but Ive never used one that had such large girt as this.  Its simply uncomfortable.	-1
This was not for me... i ended up using it as shaving cream.	-1
This is my first experience with this particular company and their products. After reading the other reviews, I was excited to see how these premium products made my shaving experience SO much better than the "cheap" stuff I currently use.  Let me start off by describing my "cheap" stuff.  It was the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Van-Der-Hagen-Premium-Shave-Set-2-5-oz-Soap-Bowl-Brush/dp/B001A3HPT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (2.5 oz. Soap, Bowl, Brush)</a>.  It cost me $9 and came with the badger brush, a bowl, and a bar of soap.  Then I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Art-of-Shaving-Brush-Stand-Black/dp/B0006B43SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Art of Shaving Brush Stand Black</a>.  It was a novel idea, but it quickly got old and left it lying around in my medicine cabinet for years.  Overall, the $9 set proved to be just as useful as this $120 set.  If you are a shaving snob, I suggest you stop here and give me a negative rating review, because you're just going to get more pissed off farther down.  This shave kit is VERY small, what I would consider sample sizes for all of the items. The sandalwood smells good and works about as good as anything (soap, shampoo, lotion, whatever), but you only get about 2 weeks of shaves worth out of this if you use it the way you're supposed to (as described on the page w/ the video and descriptions).  The pre shave oil spreads nicely, but is not much different or better than the Gillette pre-shave balm I normally use, also from the dollar store. The shave cream is thick and very luxurious, I've yet to find an equal for that stuff (hence the second star that I awarded to this product!).  The after shave lotion does make my skin feel smooth, I guess, but no moreso than my Nivea lotion that I got at the dollar store.  For this price, I was hoping that they would at least include the stainless steel razor and stand that the dude on the product pictures uses.  But no, apparently that's a premium.  To me, this is not a "kit", it is some stuff you can put on your face, and a brush to put on your face with.  This is only step one of the shaving process - they don't provide you the tools necessary to complete step 2: SHAVE!! Thus, to me, it should not be labeled a 'kit'.  *Conclusion: I got this for free through Amazon Vine.  I would NEVER pay $120 for this product.  I have a $79 electric razor that I use on a daily basis that I haven't changed the blades in 3 years.  I am cheap, and not the demographic that the Art of Shaving was reaching for when pricing this product.  This company is likely targeting to the types of people that pay $200 on a pair of designer jeans or upwards of $5000 on a designer summer dress.  I'm the type of dude that trolls Goodwill for deals on used underwear.  You know what I can get for $120 dollars!!?  I can go to a shave shop and have an old-timey dude give me a hot shave with steaming lather while one of his daughters gives me a neck massage and his son shines my shoes for $40 bucks, and that would still leave enough left over for lunch and a happy ending!!  If you're DYING to throw away some $$ and try this anyway b/c you want to feel like a semi-smooth faced chump, I found that you could actually buy the elements (less the cheap/low quality brush-which isn't worth more than $10-$15 anyway!) for about $80-$100 total. So, FOR SURE skip the kit,(and I would say these products altogether).  It made my skin feel nice, but not incredible or $100+ of a hit to my wallet.	-1
this is supposed to be medium and it's not it is very dark and it looks as though someone has already used it. I am not normally allergic to Laura Geller's products but I am on this one. I purchased the Laura Geller regular/medium and it is not dark at all and I did not feel the itching the moment I tried it on. don't know the difference but their is and I would not recommend this product at all.	-1
I was ready to love this, but unfortunately, I don't. I have mild rosacea that I keep well controlled, but I really need a better anti-aging moisturizer The first day after using it, I noticed my face felt softer and I was excited.  By day 3, rosacea pustules popped up (I haven't had any in 3 years).  I decided maybe it needed to get worse before better and stuck it out, but instead it just got worse and worse.  I ended up with several huge pustules and redness like never before. The good news is that it was prime and therefore easy to return to Amazon for a full refund.  I also felt like it was a decent moisturizer for my neck and chest area, but not good enough to keep just for that.	-1
unfortunately this product clogs my skin and breaks me out, im guessing its the squalane because i am fine with glycerine. its also not very moisturizing, and it kind of burns sometimes going on, not to mention makes my face turn reddish and shiny. the redness dissipates but the shine factor does not go away especially on the forehead, so i would only use this at night. but anyway i will probably have to give this away as i feel its too expensive and too small of an amount to waste as a hand cream or something haha.	-1
I did not like this face wash and was pretty disappointed because I am a huge La Roche-Posay fan. Their other products have really impressed me but this face wash burned my eyes so badly  even without getting it directly in them, just in the normal course of washing my face.  It also left my skin really really clean which may sound great but I couldn't help but feel it was stripping my skin of every single bit of moisture.  I swear my skin would make a squeaking noise when I rubbed my finger over it after using this. So, no thank you, I would like to keep my moisture barrier.	-1
my skin is allergic to this . so i have to return it. i am so sad because it doesnt work for me.	-1
my skin doesnt like this lotion. it feels very uncomfortable after i applied it.	-1

May 2017 Update:  So, I've decided this is really not worth it and lowered my rating accordingly.  It just doesn't perform the touted benefits and isn't worth the premium price tag.  I tried using it on extremely dry skin and it only provided temporary relief.  An hour later, the skin was dry and flaky again.  Even long term use did not provide any improvement over much cheaper products and it actually performed worse than many of them.  There may be other benefits or ingredients that some may find desirable or beneficial but as far as strictly moisturizing, there are much cheaper options that moisturize just as good or better.  I tried a small sample vial of this serum.  I have very dry skin. I use several different hydrating creams with varying results but I'm always open to trying new products. I tested this on one side against Moisture Therapy intensive care cream from Avon on the other. The iS serum rubbed in nicely, was fast absorbing and made my skin feel smooth after application.  iS touts Hyaluronic Acid as "nature's most powerful hydrator".  The Avon side applied, felt and looked every bit as good as the iS side.  It also held up as long as the iS side.  Gotta admit, I expected a much more pronounced difference pitting a $2 product against a $90 product.  One thing I'm not particularly fond of with the iS serum is the scent. It smells like a rubber gym ball.  At least the scent wears off in a relatively short amount of time.  Another thing I question is why it contains dye.  For an expensive serum like this, the last thing I expect are unnecessary ingredients that have a potential to irritate, such as dyes.  I've tried expensive dermatologist office sold products like iS before.  I honestly find them overpriced for what you get.  Some may swear by them but if I don't see fifty times the difference, I can't justify spending fifty times the price.	-1
I found this product to be frustrating, not terrible but not worth the high price.  Firstly it commits the packaging sin of having TWICE as much space in the box as the tiny little bottle takes up.  There is literally no reason for it to be in that size box, except to imply that the consumer is getting more product than they are actually getting.  Dishonest.  It has a very strong, distinctive smell which I personally did not prefer for my face.  It lingers because the serum is an oil base, so you still get whiffs of the smell long after you've applied it.  It takes a while to sink in due to the oily nature of the product.  While I think this allows for a good concentration of the hyaluronic acid component, it's a little unpleasant if you accidentally touch your face before it's absorbed.  I strongly dislike this brand's lack of a transparent disclosure of ingredients.  I want to know exactly what I'm putting on my face.  This information is severely lacking - they say that it's hyaluronic acid and oil, but that's it.  I'm sure there are other additives.	-1
Felt like baby oil. Very heavy on the skin. Broke my skin out.	-1
This serum is very oily. Too oily for a serum. It's very slick on the skin and goes on more like a layer rather than absorbing right in. It takes quite a while for it to absorb, and actually, I don't feel like it ever fully absorbs no matter how lightly a I apply it. My skin feels oily and slick until I wash it off... such as if I apply it in the morning, it'll stay greasy feeling all the way into the evening/night unless I wash my face sooner than that.  I don't have many wrinkles aside from a few tiny ones at the corner of my eyes, but I didn't see any improvement in those. I didn't think my skin looked better or worse in general, except for the fact that using this serum made me break out in tiny pimples on my upper lip.  I wouldn't buy this due to how oily it is and the lack of any kind of benefit from using it.	-1
It takes too long to get all the makeup off with this brush cleaner. I found myself using almost half the bottle for just a few of my brushes.	-1
Literally only lasted one cleaning of my brushes. And it didn't even clean them thoroughly.	-1
Product has a greasy feel. Does not feel like the brush is clean after use. I do not recommend. I will not be purchasing again.	-1
It probably does what it says, but man it burns my skin while it's on. Says leave on for 5-10 minutes, but at 5 minutes I have to wash it off. Does really degrease the skin, like it says. But I'm sure there are other products that do so without the burn	-1
I do not like this perfume at all. To me, it smells like something an old woman would wear. Doesn't surprise me since there are none of the typical "young" notes in here at all (especially vanilla). Or if there are, I sure as heck can't smell them! All the friends I've asked have agreed with me that this is an old woman-smelling perfume. I sold mine on ebay.	-1
I have tried Derby, Gillette 7 O'clock Green, Black, and Yellow, Gillette Silver Blues, Blue bird, Astra, Shark, Feather, and Dorko blades and none were near as bad as this one. Very uncomfortable blade for my face. My buddy gave me a pack and after one shave with these I have zero desire to try another go with these horrid blades.	-1
Not a good shave for me. I am now a Feather only guy as I need a razor that is super sharp and will not drag.	-1
These razor blades are way overpriced. I have gotten a much better shave from blades that are much cheaper. The Astra or Derby Blades in particular give a better smoother shave and are much cheaper.	-1
Way too expensive, bad QC, not the sharpest. At a $2.00 they'd be good, at the prices Merkur charges, its highway robbery!	-1
I took a chance on this because I have a sudden weird new scalp issue and thought this would help it. I put it on for a half hour or so before I washed it and I did this every few days for a few weeks and it did nothing but flare it up. On the other hand, the pouch it came in was neat and my puppies LOVE to play with it!!	-1
This product did nothing to control my frizz.  I live in Florida where the humidity is off the rails and this product was an epic fail for me.  Yes, it doesn't contain silicone, and that's great for those who are silicone sensitive.  However, silicone is the only defrizzer that works for me when the humidity climbs to 90%.  This balm does smell wonderful and goes on smoothly, and it did make my dry, frizz prone hair smooth.  But once I stepped outside my air-conditioned house, all hell broke loose.  Within an hour, the frizz was back with a vengeance and I was right back where I started, as if I had not applied any product or made any effort at styling my hair at all.  So I can't exactly understand the good reviews for this product.  I purchased it at Ulta, so I know it is authentic.  I also purchased Phyto 7 leave in conditioner, which is nice.  However, this product is promptly going back to the store.  Years ago, this was a cult favorite, but that was before silicone serums started appearing on the market.  As far as the Florida humidity goes, only silicone is strong enough to eliminate Florida frizz.  I recommend a few products that have worked well for me.  For drugstore, Got2b Shine Serum is pure silicone and works as well as much more expensive serums.  Moroccan Oil Treatment and Macadamia Professional serum are both good options.  Apply these to clean damp hair.  I use about a nickel size dollop for my below shoulder length hair.  Be careful not to apply these products to the roots.  I apply them to the midlengths and ends and then, without adding any more product, I smooth what's left on my hands over the top layer of my hair, avoiding the part.  Also good, is Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer, which hydrates, provides thermal protection (as do the serums), adds shine and eliminates frizz completely.  It's a 10 Miracle Leave-In is also good.  Spray these on clean damp hair before styling products.  These products are holy grail products for me and work much better than Phyto.  But if you're on a no silicone kick, by all means give this product a try.  However, if the humidity where you live is high, you'd be better off with one of the serums or sprays I've mentioned.  I definitely don't recommend this product.	-1
I purchased this product because I read that it was supposed to take the frizz out of your hair and make it soft and smooth.  Well, it didn't do anything like that.  I'm sorry, but would not purchase again.  Maybe it will work for someone that does not color their hair.	-1
Meh. It goes on pretty dry and flaky. My lashes look crunchy and don't hold a curl. I'll be sticking with my Dior primer.	-1
One of the few Jack Black products I am not crazy about. It doesn't seem to be complete. Hard to spread, not smooth. I prefer Lab Series on this one.	-1
This stuff is garbage..I really thought it would lather up into a nice cream and make for a good shave. It barelys lathers up, and that is with using a top of the line silvertip badger brush (I would hate to see how it lathers with only using finger tips) I am glad that I only bought a few samples packets of this becuase if I paid $20+ for this I would not be happy. Save yourself the money and buy some Proraso or Truefitt and Hill shave cream, you will get a much better lather and shave. I will not be purchasing this again. I have a hard time believing that Jack Black actually sells this and people buy it for $20. One of the worst creams I have tried thus far. F+ product all the way...	-1
This perfume smells like cheap (and strong) shampoo or highly fragrant dryer sheets. I sprayed some on a piece of blotter paper, recoiled at the onslaught of aroma chemicals, and then put it back in the box. About a half an hour later, I saw a friend who knows I love (and collect) perfume. She commented, "You smell like cheap perfume!" What she was smelling was merely a few scent molecules that had wafted off the paper and "stuck" to my clothes. This supposedly "soft feminine" fragrance is one of the reasons perfumes are increasingly banned in public places. This fragrance was popular in the '90s; perhaps it's been reformulated. Perhaps not. Either way, this iteration is simply awful to my nose.	-1
I origionall bought this liquid foundation because my dermatologist recommended it.  I bought this item because the other 2 liquid foundations I have bought from gloMinerals don't match my skin color either.  But I like the coverage. So now I mix them together and so far am more satisfied with the mixture than any of the 3 individual tubes.	-1
Ridiculously hard to use.  Practically have to chip it out of the jar and there's no way to get it evenly throughout my hair.  Even if I comb it through I find hard lumps all day.  Pretty strong hold, though.  I moved down to the PASTE pomade, which seems to be more maleable.	-1
While this product holds your hair well, it contains too much clay for my liking. I literally felt like I had clay in my hair all day and when I would run my hand through my hair during the day, it would come out with a bit of clay on it such that I felt the need to then wash my hands.  I much prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/American-Crew-Fiber-3-0-oz/dp/B0008IV7BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">American Crew Fiber 3.0 oz.</a>&nbsp;which performs nearly almost as well but doesn't leave your hair all clay-like. It's also cheaper.  On the plus side, this product comes in a nice cool glass can and smells great.	-1
I love OPI nail polish and think it is worth every penny. Unfortunately, this lacquer remove works no better than the dollar store polish remover. I was very disappointed.	-1
I would give this zero stars. Formula is very watery. Something is not right with it. I will be returning. Very disappointed for an OPI product.	-1
I guess I should have realized this would be yellow by having "chick" in the polish name. It didn't look that yellow on my phone. It's definitely yellow, not the neutral color I was expecting.	-1
its ok	-1
I normally don't leave reviews but the polish I received was too thick, difficult to apply and most definitely not the color advertised. Color is more of a peachy yellow than nude. I  love Opi polish but not satisfied with this one.	-1
This review is for Russian Navy. Nice color, but when you remove it, it's a real mess, it makes it look like you have dirty hands and nails, the stuff gets under your nails and you have a big mess, discolors your natural nails too. Awful! I have it away from my other polishes to be sure I don't use it again. I had to refile my nails and tried very hard to get the staining off, I wanted to cry. I use a base coat too so this isn't the case. I love opi, but they can keep this, not sure what there doing, I hope it's just this color and they haven't changed the formula, I do not recommend this unless you want dirty looking nails and hands upon removal	-1
Got it for My Wife. Nevertheless she said her nails chip within a day of applying it. She will just stick with gel nail polish instead.	-1
I have used this product several times and it just doesn't work for me. If anything it takes my nails longer to dry. I see all the positive reviews and I don't get it. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?	-1
Don't get the hype surrounding this brand of nail polish. I put it on my toes and it didn't last three days before showing signs of wear and chips. I usually use a drugstore brand that is a 3rd of the price (cheaper), and that stuff stays put. This is just overpriced and not very durable.	-1
Love OPI nail polish. This color did not work out for me. I was hoping for a sheer peachy pink.  I have tried applying it several times, with lots of shaking to blend.  Every time I got a streaky look unless I applied enough coats to create an opaque look, which was then a bit too white and bright to flatter my pale skin tone.	-1
Spray not working!! I tried to open the nozzle with a needle, put it under hot water, to no avail. I just wasted close to $10 on a non-functional hair spray. Very, very disappointing.	-1
I did not purchase this on Amazon, I paid $9 u.s. For this. I am a cashier and after a six hour shift, my nails were dirty looking, I have a French manicure and the shine didn't last after my work shift. I'm back to opi, the French manicure is brighter and healthier looking	-1
Arrived leaky and too coagulated to use. Such a waste of money.	-1
The packaging is very cool - a half flat bottle, but that's the only distinguishing advantage of this product. First, the color is way too emerald green - it will show through semi-opaque light polish colors. The nails look greenish/bluish and not attractive. Second, it doesn't prolong nail polish wear, it shortens it (I've tested it with a couple of polishes from different brands). Third, it takes forever to dry. Even fast dry top coats that dry polishes can't properly dry this stuff.  There is nothing good about this product, except the packaging.	-1
Every time I use this base coat, my CND polish wears off too quickly. Too bad since I like the large round bottle and other CND products have been great. Maybe its not meant to be used with CND Vinylux Weekly Polish?	-1
I did not purchase this on Amazon, I paid $9 u.s. dollars for this and it's awful on preserving the French manicure, it turned my nails green, even in very thin layer, which I only applied one, then the shiny top coat, not impressed, was excited being it is CND but it's terrible, returned to OPI, my French manicure is brighter and healthier looking	-1
I have tried DOZENS of acne treatment products from Amazon, and this was among the worst. My heart sank as soon as I used this cleanser for the first time, because it BURNED. I tried to hold out hope, reasoning that perhaps it was only because it contained strong medicine (which my acne-ravaged skin BADLY needs) and my skin would adjust. HA! ONE DAY of using this and other Mario Badescu products and my skin was so hideously ravaged it looked like I had a contagious disease. I just don't understand it because the ingredients listed in these products are not ones that usually have an adverse effect on my skin. Oh, and by the way, all of the Mario Badescu products I ordered (via Amazon LLC) came UNSEALED, and were not even in any kind of box/container/wrapper. Considering that several of the products were LIQUIDY, that's crazy. But I will say Amazon gave me a FULL refund, which is indeed very honorable and shows great integrity.	-1
I did not see that the buffering lotion was of any benefit to me.	-1
This one is supposed to be for the really bad acne. The cystic kind that I was adorned with. Did not help at all. I still suggested it to people, it might work for them.	-1
I love all of Mario B.'s other products but this one did NOT hit the spot (ha), unfortunately.  I suppose it dries it out a small amount as any alcohol product would.  Have used for a month and noticed no difference in the size of my cystic acne.  :(	-1
This did not work at all for my acne. Seemed very watery as well, so difficult to get it to stay where you wanted it.	-1
I tried this on cystic acne a few times but it did not seem to really do much of anything at all over the course of a few days, to be honest. I think the drying lotion by mario badescu works much better on cystic acne and it's the best spot treatment I've found for acne in general so far. I gave this away.	-1
I don't think this is a particularly effective product. I tried using it on those deep under the skin pimples, and the ones at the surface, and it did not make any sort of difference. I find that tea tree oil is much more effective. However, this does go quite nicely under makeup.	-1
I love a bunch of stuff from MB, but this is too harsh. And it stopped working after a while  though it really wasn't that effective to start. Recently I had a huge hormonal cystic atrocity on the side of my chin. This product is supposed to be extra helpful for this kind of acne, but it did nothing. Smells very strong of alcohol. Thankfully I found lavender essential oil - it works so well! Love MB in general but would suggest others to maybe look into essentials oils for acne concerns.	-1
This product is rubbing alcohol with a little zinc oxide. That's it. Save yourself tons of money and skip this. Or just buy a bottle of rubbing alcohol.	-1
I purchased this from Ulta. I enjoy a couple of MB other things, so gave this a try. I have sensitive, combination oily, acne prone skin. This product says you can use it on either cystic acne or small acne clusters emerging on the skin. I used it for two weeks straight on a small area of breakout on my face and didn't notice much of a change in my breakouts at all. I feel like I was just rubbing alcohol with baby oil on my face (the best way I can describe this stuff). I don't think it's worth the price, and I doubt it would work on cystic acne. I have gotten two cystic acne pimples last summer, so I get that rather infrequently, and can't comment on the product on cystic acne.	-1
I know that most people must think they know what cystic acne is, but they really don't. I don't blame people, before when I got a larger "normal" zit, I thought it was a cyst, that is until I developed REAL cystic acne in my 20's. I have had the pimples that people are describing in their reviews and let me tell you, if you have ever had TRUE cystic acne this product will do nothing for you. For sufferers of real cystic acne you know what I am talking about--REAL cystic acne are nodules; hard, huge, sore lumps (not just big zits)that take months to go away. These nodules are so large and painful it's hard to move your face and are generally pea size or larger (I get ones that are larger than a lima bean). The cysts I get are so large and inflamed that I need to get cortisone injections just to bring the swelling down and relieve pain. A dermatologist will tell you there is nothing you can do topically for a real cyst, they need to be injected to bring down the swelling and from experience I can tell you this is true. I tried this as a last resort before Accutane, but I can tell you if you really truly suffer from cystic acne, this will do nothing for your nodules; large "normal" zits maybe, but not true cystic nodules.	-1
First of all, I had to get past the horrible, chemical, plastic smell to even try the product...I was barely able to do it! It stinks like Aqua Net and/or other cheap drug store hair sprays. This did not add any volume whatsoever to my hair. In fact, it seemed to weigh it down AND I was stuck with that stench until I washed my hair. For me, this product is garbage...which is where it went after one use.	-1
This spray did nothing at all for my medium textured layered hair.  I have no idea why this has become a cult favorite.  Many years ago, it was recommended in the fashion magazines all the time, so naturally, when I was in NYC, I had to buy it.  However, it was a miserable failure.  Not only did it not produce any volume whatsoever (I sprayed it on the roots, where, naturally, volume should be) but it made my hair oily and I had to wash it again the next day (I usually shampoo every other day or every two days).  It also comes in a very small container so it's very expensive to use.  I just sprayed a few spritzes on the roots and then blew my hair dry upside down.  When I lifted my head, yes, I had volume, but by the time I used a curling iron to create some waves, the volume had totally deflated and my hair was, once again, completely flat.  So much for that.  I can't figure out why this was ever touted as a great product by Vogue, Elle and other women's magazines. I think the fact that it's made in France has something to do with its mystique.  However, times have changed and so has the market for hair products.  Perhaps back then, there were few volumizing options, but now, the market is flooded with choices and there are far better products out there.  Right now, I like Living Proof Amp, which is a cream that's applied to the roots of clean, dry hair.  It provides long lasting subtle volume that can be easily revived with a few discrete fluffs.  So far, it works well for me, but I am exploring other options all the time.  But this Phyto spray is definitely a fail for me.  I used it a couple of time, each time trying a different technique to create volume and each time failing.  So now, it sits in my hall closet, where hair product FAILS go to die.  I hate to pawn it off on family or friends, because it simply doesn't work.  I have no problem spending big money for hair products that actually do what they claim to do, but I absolutely HATE spending good money for crap.  And believe me, this product sucks.  I guess Phyto paid off the editors of the magazines that recommended this spray, either that, or the editors are simply fascinated with French-made products, whether they work or not.  And of course, editors receive a bounty of free products that they are then duty bound to recommend.  That is the only scenario that explains why this product received so many positive reviews.  I'm sure my experience is not unique though.  Before you waste $29 on this spray, consider the following:  it is not a hairspray at all but is oily like a heavy conditioner, it certainly is NOT for fine hair, and the size is ridiculously small.  All I can say is that this is definitely not a good volumizing product.  I don't recommend it at all.  And if you buy it on Amazon, you'll very likely get a counterfeit product.  All the more reason to skip it and keep looking.	-1
It's meant to help make my hair lustrous but I can't put this on because IT SMELLS SO BAD! Just yuck  !	-1
For some reason, I found this dried out my hair and left my looking more and more like Reverend Jim.	-1
While the mint smell of this conditioner is nice because it's not overwhelming, that's about the only good thing I can say about it. I'm just not sure why it's priced at $15 when it's chock full of chemicals that most higher quality companies have been leaving out of their shampoos and conditioners for years. And after using it, it didn't work well enough to make it worth that price tag, either - my hair felt like I'd used any old bottle of drugstore/supermarket conditioner. The only reason I'm not throwing it away is because I can tuck it aside in case I run out of a better conditioner and forget to go to the store to pick up more.	-1
This expensive conditioner gives a bad first impression since I couldn't get the pump to pop up. Other reviewers have said the same things, so this was not a fluke with my bottle. The mechanism is cheap. I understand that I can get out my pliers and operate on the thing, but really, that's annoying. I didn't have a pair of pliers in my shower, unfortunately.  Second, while the conditioner smells good, it has some harsh ingredients such as menthol. Anything that leaves your scalp tingling may feel cool, but it's an irritant.  Third, we didn't find this conditioner to be more effective than the cheap stuff. I'm not sure why it costs so much.	-1
I love La Roche Posey products, but this just doesn't meet my expectations. First of all, it burns really bad, but also causes me to breakout and I haven't had breakouts in years. I do not have sensitive skin and am used to glycolic acid peels, but for some reason I am sensitive to something in this formula. This is a hard pass for me.	-1
BURNED my skin, acne and overall skin condition got infinitely worse	-1
I have pretty sensitive skin so I was hoping this would work well.  It didn't.  Although it didn't irritate my skin, it definitely made me break out lightly, which is weird. I didn't really care for the feel of it either. I think I will stick with my natural Burt's Bees creamy cleanser. :(	-1
It does make your hair and nail grow FAST. But if you are getting this for thinning hair, if you want more volume for your hair, this will not do the magic.	-1
I hate to be one of the few that hate this product. I can't think of one thing I liked about it. Some of the cons I experienced are: leaves a chalky white ghost face (I am already pretty fair), broke me out terribly after first use (maybe it's hard to wash off?), didn't settle into my skin/remained greasy throughout the day, had a greasy thick silicone feel upon application, did not look good under my makeup and caused it to flake and look weird  (maybelline fit me matte). For reference my skin is oily/combination and acne prone, reactive/sensitive, fair to fair medium, and normally I use olay complete sensitive spf 15 with no real problem I was just looking for a higher spf and a less greasy formula.	-1
I have sensitive skin so it's not easy to find something I can wear all day long without a problem. I had high hopes after reading so many positive reviews on this product. The texture and easy of use was ok and I like that it truly did not have any scent (unlike so many others that say it do not but do) and did not leave my skin greasy or too white. However, this sunscreen not only sting my eyes(I avoided near the eyes) but also irritated my skin. I got bumps all across my facial skin both times I was wearing this sunscreen. I might use this for special occasion like on the beach, but can't use this as a daily sunscreen as it's apparently too harsh on my skin.	-1
Like Elta MD but this product leaves residue on my face...does not blend in:-(	-1
I purchased this based on reviews and am really disappointed with it! The edges dull, don't care what you do, they dull and well the filing stops there!	-1
Too greasy. I've exchanged for asian sunscreens which are the best on the market.	-1
irratedand use it on hands	-1

When I tried to find out about the ingredients of EltaMD UV Sport Broad-Spectrum SPF 50, I noticed the following claim on their Website;  Active Ingredients: 9.0% Zinc oxide, 7.50% Octinoxate, 5.0% Octisalate  Ingredient Insights; Tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E): Antioxidant that reduces free radicals to help diminish the visible signs of aging Zinc oxide: Natural mineral compound that works as a sunscreen agent by reflecting and scattering UVA and UVB rays Octinoxate: Organic compound that helps increase UV protection  Inactive Ingredients: Bees Wax, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Dimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Hexyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Purified Water, Sodium Chloride, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane.  Both active and inactive ingredients are full of chemicals but why would EltaMD would try to promote a hazardous material like Octinoxate as an organic compound worth placing it on human's biggest organ which gets absorbed and processed by the liver is an indication of EltaMD institutional values.	-1
I have acne prone combo skin. Although I like MB, this stuff is a joke. After using for 2 weeks I gave up. This stuff leaves my face greasy and filmy, and by the end of the day I feel very gross. When my glasses have oil left on them I know we have a major problem.	-1
I have combo skin and have been using this a couple times a week for the past 2 weeks. Unfortunately I do not see ANY positive difference to my skin whatsoever. Actually, my skin is looking TERRIBLE now from it. I have been breaking out with cystic acne on my cheeks, zits and bumps all over my jawline and forehead. I also notice my skin peeling only on my forehead. I recommend to stay away from this product! Just skip it, it sounds too good to be true because it is! Don't waste your money and time on it.	-1
I think that either Badescu changed the formula, or this is not the original cleanser. This smells much more citrusy and burns my eyes. It is not the formula that i have always bought directly from the Mario Badescu site.	-1
didnt work for me moving on from Mario Badescu tried multiple products nothing worked!	-1
Really dried out my skin. It cleaned my face just fine, but I felt dry after instead of refreshed and renewed.	-1
This product really dried out my skin after a couple of uses. It may work on really oily skin but for combination/sensitive skin like mine, it didn't help me.	-1
Terrible! I have combo skin and have been using this for about 2 weeks. I don't notice ANY positive changes whatsoever. I kept giving it time and a chance, but its doing absolutely nothing for my skin. I have actually been breaking out terribly! Cystic acne on my cheeks, zits and bumps on my forehead and jawline. Also, I have noticed peeling on my forehead, but its not dry there. I can't recommend this to anyone. Just don't waste your time and money.	-1
I am disappointed I bought this product. I hoped that it would exfoliate the skin, thus aiding in the fading of post acne marks. Unfortunately I experienced no results with this, even when I used it every night for several months. This led me to searching reviews online to see what others have experienced. I found out on Paula's Choice that this product contains so little glycolic acid that it's ineffective, and the pH is not in the range that would allow the acid to work properly on the skin even if there was enough of the acid. This explained why I was experiencing no results. The grapefruit and aloe vera in the product doesn't help my acne either (which one thinks it would), which makes me wonder if this product is simply 99% water. This is a large waste of money. When I use this, nothing happens and my skin is the same as when I don't use it. I still have the majority of the bottle and don't think I'll ever be able to finish it up because it's an unnecessary step that doesn't benefit my skin at all. If you are looking for a product to exfoliate with glycolic acid, try Ren's Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask. That product actually works and results in bright skin. Don't waste your money on this!	-1
Not true Hawaiian orchid! Hate the color won't use, unfortunately I threw away the package so I can't return!	-1
This product provides a disappointing finish. I love Nail Envy in clear, but the version in color is problematic. Because it is not "self leveling" it dries with bush marks no matter how many times and ways I try to apply it. This bottle going in the trash.	-1
I love OPI's Nail Envy and have used it for several years.  So, why am I giving it 1-star?  Because it's hit-or-miss whether you'll get the same stuff each time you order this particular product.  The first time I bought it was from a salon and I was a fan from the start.  For the first time ever, I finally found a nail strengthener that really works for me and, best of all, STAYS ON!  I simply apply two coats of the Nail Envy, follow that with 1-2 coats of my nail laquer color of choice, and then top it with either a second coat of clear Nail Envy or OPI Top Coat.  It makes my nails stronger and longer then they've ever been, plus I can count on it to stay for 6-8 days before needing to strip off the layers and start over.  I've successfully ordered this from Amazon with positive results.  But, unfortunately, that's not always the case lately.  Sometimes it's a close match but just different enough in its performance that I question it.  My latest order gives me no doubt, though, despite arriving in its usual original-looking box/wrapping.  Counterfeit or a major change in OPI's formula, who knows?  But it's awful.  It doesn't stay on well at all and yellows horribly.  Despite the convenience of ordering online, I'm going back to buying it from a salon.	-1
I haven't noticed a difference in my nails except for the shine.	-1
I paint my nails very often so I'm very disappointed to find that this has formaldehyde in it.  I prefer not to repeatedly use products that contain it given the well-established negative health effects so this will probably end up in the bin...  I've had great luck with Barielle's nail strengthening products which are non-toxic so I think I'll be sticking with those. It's a shame though, I had really high hopes for this!	-1
Doesn't work very well!	-1
opi is a great product.. i bought the soft and thin one and it didn't work for me at all. i guess i should've got the original one. i ended up buying sally hansen hard as nails at target for $2.49 and it's working GREAT! my nails are paper thin and bend backwards and split down the middle and have ridges. they are a mess! especially after taking off my acrylics. i would try the regular...	-1
This product was a waste of money.  I have not seen any improvement in my nails after using this formula.  I will not buy it again.  It is far too expensive to deliver such poor results.	-1
I love OPI's colors as far as the polishes are concerned.  However, the durability factor of this product is just the worst.  I know people have said this product is just awesome, but take it from a teacher who subjects her hands to chalk 185 days a year; it just doesn't hold up.  For the price I paid, it didn't hold up well and was unfortunately not worth the money.	-1
So I have to preface this by stating that we've been using a specific type of body wash for awhile, but I'm always willing to give another one a try. I was hopeful that this body wash would be as good as what I was using - unfortunately, it isn't. It does smell good, that's for sure, but I wasn't able to get a good lather and what lather I did get didn't last very long. We've been using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Neutrogena-Rainbath-Gel-Original-16-Ounce/dp/B000052ZBD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Neutrogena Rainbath Gel, Original, 16  Ounce</a>&nbsp;and I can easily say that the Neutrogena gel is much more enjoyed in our house.	-1
All things considered, this was a disappointment.  The smell, which is somewhat astringent and chemical, lingers.  Even if I liked the scent itself better, I prefer fragrances that soften over time, rather than.....stay there.  I am aware that what people find pleasant, scent-wise, and how long they like a scent to linger, are highly individual things.  That said, I would definitely not recommend this lotion to people who don't like strong, rather chemical fragrances. This one is cloying enough to give the user a headache.  I also don't think that this is a high-quality lotion.  It doesn't absorb well, and it really doesn't do much to soften or soothe dry skin.  Neutragena, Eucerin, Nivea, Burts Bees....all make products that are better moisturizers and have less strident smells.	-1
From my wife: this setting powder made me look like a geisha. Instead of being translucent as promised, it turns my face white. Making it look dry and over done. I was hoping for a more matte look. However, it does seem to make my blush have longer staying power, even after a workout. The label on the packaging looks like a label printed from my computer. The quality of this product is questionable at best.	-1
I wanted to love this. The description sounded just like something Id like and i hoped that the toilette parfum would be light enough to wear to work and not offend anyone. Plus I have used other products from Crabtree and Evelyn and been pleased. Alas, it was not to be. I have a sensitive nose, overly sensitive probably. But this was all kinds of no. No with a capital NUH uh. The was to lavender as banana popsicles are to bananas. I adore a good fresh lavender but this was not a clear astringent lavender, it was a chemical maelstrom of lavender. It has a heavy alcohol top note, which is to be expected with a toilette water but it hung on much longer than I wanted, but the powdery middle note was just odd and it lasted much too long in that middle range of too strong to be two hours old. Then the bottom note is too much Grandmas hankie drawer for me, though it was more in the muted range I expected.  My advice if you want to try it because you like that old fashioned type of scent is to apply it properly- spray into the air and walk through it, never apply directly to the skin. Or try using it as a light room spray or closet spray. I don't want to preach here but gone are the days of women wearing heavy scents into work and getting away with it. So many of us are crammed into more reconditioned air and we all need to be sensitive to the noses of our coworkers. No one wants to be remembered as that strongly stinky person in the office. Your scent should be special to you and to anyone who is close enough to share it in your personal space.	-1
This is absolutely terrible smelling. It's a combination of old lady and very old, sickly-sweet perfume smell-- not at all like the other crabtree & evelyn products I've had over the years. A cute box and bottle don't make up for the odor.  I sprayed it on a jacket and have had to wash the jacket to get rid of the horrible smell.	-1
Disappointed very over priced water!	-1
I did not like anything about this product. The scent seemed medicinal, the feeling of it on my skin was unpleasant  (I washed it off immediately), and it did not do a good job taking my eyeliner off. I would recommend Neutrogena's make up remover.	-1
Completely stripped the gray from my hair and left it blonde. Just terrible	-1
I have dry, hardworking hands and was looking forward to this.  What a disappointment! It's thin and does virtually nothing for the dry chapped skin and cuticles on my hands.  I thought perhaps I should simply apply more, but even a small amount of this is highly scented. I felt as if I was wearing perfume on my fingertips. Every time I waved my hands in front of my face I could smell it too much. This made me feel uncomfortable about preparing a meal without washing my hands first and that thought has never occurred to me with any other hand or cuticle cream.  I happen to love and wear perfume; this is so heavily fragranced that it "competes" and that's not good.	-1
I get dry hands, dry cuticles. I am always looking for a therapy to help me not have so many hangnails, and rips.  Crabtree &Evelyn Nail and Cuticle Therapy smells like a pine tree to me, which is not pleasant. It absorbed quickly and left my cuticles soft which is what it is supposed to do but I get that from plain old cheap coconut oil.	-1
Have to be real careful using this applicator. To achieve that even look, have to spend some time doing light coats over and over the same area like you're painting a car. The hard part about it is you're pumping the applicator and may squeeze little harder or faster then previously. It's not like an aerosol can spraying at the same speed. Sometimes it'll spray more than what you want leaving spots on the scalp making it look obviously freaky. Taking out the spot and trying to redo the application can be time consuming. Over priced pump applicator that doesn't guarantee an even spray each time. Hope you don't have a lead finger.	-1
I am extremely bald on top and use the fibers to give a full look. I  purchasesed with the kit on deal to help w percise spots in front and hairline. This is not percise, and does not shoot out enough fibers, instead its like shooting a gun, you get powder residue behind....shoots out more powder than fibers. Also blows off what fibers you already applied by shaking on. To me this applicator is pointless and doesn't do what it's supposed to do, I'll just stick to the shaking method. Somine else recomended a hair dye bottle applicator, I may try that n re-review.	-1
This applicator gets clogged after a few applications and then is impossible to clean so stops working altogether. It's hugely overpriced as well!	-1
I ordered this along with a couple sizes of toppik bottles, including the .97 that it is supposed to fit. It fits NONE of them. What a completely senseless situation. Who is running this company? Such a seemingly basic thing - make all your bottle openings the same size and make an attachment that actually fits them.	-1
not needed for me personally, I just sprinkle the toppik.	-1
Didnt work at all. Very difficult to push, would not recommend.	-1
I was really enjoying this until it got clogged after less than one month of use. I tried multiple ways to get it cleaned out but ended up ditching it. I just shake the bottle close to my head and it works fine.	-1
They turned a well priced, decent product and ruined it. Now it's even worse than its competitors. It comes out thick and chunky, with no semblance of a natural look.	-1
Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but this doesn't work at all for me. It just blows the product off of my hair...	-1
Waste of money	-1
I like the product, but was looking for an easier way to apply instead of just shaking it on.  I thought his was my solution.  It did not fit the canister and even if it did, it was a bulb type of spray.  It would have been hard to use, if it fit the canister.	-1
I ordered this hoping it would improve the the Toppik application process and the end result.  Simply stated, it did not.  I apply Toppik every morning to my 12 year old daughter's head (she suffers from trichotillamania).  If I am unable to use this device to apply Toppik to my daughter's head I doubt very much that one could use it  to apply Toppik to one's own self.	-1
It is hard to tell whether powder is coming out of this thing or not! Though I use a lot of it, it doesn't cover the thin hair spots very well. I prefer Joan Rivers 'Great Hair Day' - so much easier to brush on the product exactly where I want it.	-1
This curling iron made unpredictable curls, and then they didn't hold. I have thick but fine almost shoulder-length hair. For years, I have been using the Hot Tools gold-plated 1.25" iron. Recently, my hair became EVEN more curl-resistant than it had been in the past. So I thought I'd try a smaller diameter barrel. I stayed with the same brand and style, but changed to this model with the tourmaline finish. So, I'm going to return it and order the Hot Tools 1" with the gold finish, and see if that does the trick.  This curling iron is nice, except for the problem I wrote about above, and it does not burn my hair or smell bad even at the highest setting. Maybe it would work for others.  Update: I received the new Hot Tools 1" iron with gold finish, and yes it worked much better for my hair than this one. Made curls that would go in the direction (under or flipped) I intended, and they last longer.  PS - and yes, I did try the hottest setting, using small sections of hair, and holding the curls for six seconds each, a number I saw an online video as being how long you need to hold for curl-resistant hair.	-1
This thing doesn't handle well at all because the handle is skinny and the barrell is heavy. Also it just doesn't get as hot as any of the other tools I have. I'm just discovering that its not the company because I bought another smaller one that works fine .I should have returned this particular one and I cant suggest it to anyone.  edit 9/4/2012: The coating is starting to come off under the clamp. I've only used it 4 times. I would suggest getting babyliss instead.	-1
This curling iron heats up so fast.  You can adjust the heat settings manually to your preference, as well as that it heats up to 450 degrees.  The bad thing:  1. It makes your hair smell bad, and also it doesnt create any curls, only gives volume, but then hair goes flat.	-1
I have very dry skin that is also mature. This dried it out even worse and made the wrinkles more pronounced of course because the hydration in my face was gone. This cream sucks up hydration and should be garbaged. End of story	-1
This stuff BURNS if you have sensitive skin. I tried to use this before going back on Accutane, and I had to not wash my face for several days for my skin to stop being red, flakey, and insanely irritated. After this, even cleansing oils and balms were too much and would sizzle, I was very disappointed because I love the PCA brand.	-1
One thing I notice about PCA products is the smell. It is strong and not nice. I don't like this toner. It's really smelly, and it is sticky after it dries up. I only used it a few times. The rest of the products like the serum phaze 24, the sunscreen lotion, the facial wash phaze 1, are all excellent.	-1
The scent for this product was overwhelming.  I gave it away.  It smells like really strong pumpkin spice.  Putting it on my face made me nauseous.	-1
I tried to like this, but the smell was overwhelming.  It has a really strong pumpkin scent that seems like it never goes away.  I will be giving this away.	-1
The smell is awful!	-1
This product burned my face. I mean literally burned my face. I thought it was because it was I purchased and used it in the winter time so I didn't try it again until this summer but I received the same results.  Will not use it again.	-1
I'll start by saying that I really like Pca products but this is definitely not one of them. I didn't care much for this toner theres not much I can say except that I prefer the pca nutrient toner it is smaller and a bit pricier but it leaves my face better plus it smells great.  UPDATE I am a big fan of PCA skin products and I had to update this review because I really believe I was sold an expired toner and other PCA products. I stopped buying PCA products on amazon after comparing them to the ones I bought with my dermatologist or @skinstore.com. I noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products I bought on amazon where different and where able to come off. Sadly I can't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore.com or skinstore.com will not even give a small discount on PCA products (PCA products are always excluded from promotions). The A&C serum I bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have  the newer (better quality) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump. With that said choose the vendor carefully.	-1
It's not paraben-free as I found out the hard way that PABA-free does not mean paraben-free. I'll read instructions better next time. It made my skin burn and I had trouble breathing. I can highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/La-Roche-Posay-Anthelios-60-Body-and-Face-Sunscreen-Melt-In-Milk-Lotion-SPF-60-with-Antioxidants-5-Fl-Oz/dp/B002CML1VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Body and Face Sunscreen Melt-In Milk Lotion, SPF 60 with Antioxidants, 5 Fl. Oz.</a>&nbsp;however, which is paraben-free on top of being fragrance-free and has been tested on sensitive skin!	-1
Giving to two stars because I think if it absorbed I would love it.  In its defense i do have oily skin (though this was suggested to me for the protection benefits). It doesn't smell bad and the texture is awesome. But my oily skin refuses to absorb it so it leaves me with a nice sheen - which by the way isn't actually super greasy which is awesome. Not the end of the world in a Boston winter BUT come summer this will have to go.  Probably great for comb/dry skin!	-1
If you have ingrown hair just stop wasting ur money on those fake products and go to the dermatologist because they need to do a procedure. That's it!!! Problem resolved ;-)	-1
Scent is a very personal preference.  I found this eau de toilette overly sweet and flowery...not too distinct from the other perfumes.  I only had 1 spritz in the air and my husband and boys all complained about the "old lady" scent.  If possible, try on some before buying.	-1
My product came out green.  I have fair skin so I was reluctant to even buy this.  I don't know why I bothered buying this garbage.	-1
Nice idea, but certainly no less streaky than conventional cremes.  Less mess for sure and an easy application, but for me this gets one star because of the very orange color that develops.  I've tried lots of self tans, and this is for sure the most orange-y in cast.  I'm pretty fair, and so half expect this result with self tanning.  But this is by far the worst of the lot.  Definitely not a natural looking brown with this towel.	-1
I have been buying these for 3 yrs and I'm so disappointed with the 2 packages I bought this yr. I can't even tell that I'm using them. When I first started using them I tanned instantly. Then I continued to buy them ,but for some reason they are not working at all. I hope they aren't outdated because then I feel I got cheated. I will probably not buy them anymore. Don't want to waste my money...	-1
After using this cream for 5 days i have a rash on my cheast  and legs and i had to stop and use cortisone . My dermatologist told me it should be use only once or twice a week . Its way to strong to be used everydays .	-1
I don't know if I got a real Bioelements product or not but this does foam when you dispense on your hand but then I feel like it turns to a watery substance and I don't feel like it is doing anything whatsoever. It seems watered down, or, just ineffective. I would not repurchase this.	-1
I am a lip balm junkie. I have lip balm on constantly. I like something with staying power - something that lasts longer than 5 minutes. I need moisturization and I don't like my balm to be too glossy/shiny. I do not consider this Baxter Salve Lip Balm to be a balm at all. A salve, perhaps as the title states, but not a balm. A balm should be thicker/heavier and provide more moisture and protection. It should go on a bit heavier. I myself prefer Carmex original twist sticks, so if you use those you will know what I mean by heavy on the lips with lots of moisturization and it does not wear off quickly.  This "balm" is more of an oily gloss. I am not sure what else to even compare it to. It does not last on the lips long at all. When it does wear off, there is no moisturization left behind and I feel like I need something on my lips immediately. It is much too this in consistency and too shiny/greasy. Lips do feel soft for those very few minutes before it wears off, but it doesn't feel like it actually penetrates the lips to really moisturize.  The scent and taste are fine for a man or woman, but the performance is weak. I would never trust this stuff in the winter months with really dry or chapped lips - it will never get the job done.	-1
I have used the equalizer for several years and liked it; but this one has a pump that does not work;  I have to pour it out of this bottle into another one to use.	-1
Made me break out sooooo badly. This is not for acne prone skin. Everywhere I sprayed I had huge pimples the next day. I gave it to a friend and she gave it back saying it broke her out terribly. She doesn't even have acne prone skin like me! Something in this must be very pore clogging or irritating. To be honest even if it didn't break me out I would have given it away because it's very sticky and left me with a major sheen on my face that I had to rinse off. Even though I rinsed it off after I sprayed it on, I still broke out like crazy... Think about that. I would patch test this if you buy it, and only buy it if you have very dry skin or plan to use it in the winter.	-1
Smells nice but made my skin too oily...  Not sure if it was Pevonia's toner or this cream, or the combination of both, but my skin didn't like the ingredients and reacted adversely.	-1
I used all 3 parts of this pevonia product and saw minimal results. Will not be repurchasing.	-1
I have fair skin. Even though I exfoliated first, I had a couple streaks but the main thing was I turned orange with this Vichy self tanner. I prefer the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vita-Liberata-Fabulous-Gradual-Self-Tanning-Lotion-6-76-fl-oz/dp/B010NL93PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vita Liberata Fabulous Gradual Self Tanning Lotion, 6.76 fl.oz.</a>&nbsp;which I used last summer. Also, with any self tanner used on your face (which I tried once) - if you have any freckles or dark spots they turn darker also. So - just be aware of that! It doesn't cover them.	-1
This continues to separate immediately which tells me it is just an oil and water solution.  I am glad it is in a clear bottle so you can tell to shake it immediately.  It did irritate my eyes, so I won't be using it again.	-1
Although this does work well on waterproof makeup, I would really only use it for that. I didn't like it for general makeup remover... it kind of made my eyes water and I have never run into that with other brands.  It's also annoying to have to shake it up every time you want to use it. It may look "fancy" to have it separate into two different colors, but it's really just goofy.  I honestly love L'Oreal Paris Micellar Cleansing Water instead... it actually works better on regular makeup (not waterproof) and it doesn't irritate at all.	-1
I actually wasn't a huge fan of this one.  It didn't remove my makeup very well particularly around my eyes... and honestly it irritated my eyes as well. I will stick to my L'Oreal one.	-1
I don't know what ingredient in this product it really burn my skin. All around eyes burning , redness and swelled. I definitely never will buy this company ever again.	-1
This cleanser is not for me.  My skin tends to be oily, so I do better with a cleaner that has some salicylic acid.  This cleaner is very much like a lotion and does not leave your skin feeling "squeeky" clean.  I can't attest to how well it removes makeup.  If you have dry skin, I would expect this cleanser to be appropriate.	-1
This cleanser has a scent (which I hate, and isn't good for sensitive skin), a texture that feels too sticky and slimey, and left a residue on my skin, that I immediately washed off using a different cleanser.  I can't imagine it being good for anyone,  I don't like anything about this product.	-1
i was very excited to try this because i love facial cleansers and I use them all with my Clarisonic.  I do like the sent of this one but it did leave my skin oily.  Even when i did the dishes right after I washed my face, the water on my hands just beaded off like i had put oil on my hands.  I really don't like the idea of having my skin pores blocked like that.  I had to wash my hands with dish detergent to get them back to normal.  I think this would be great for people with dry or troubled skin.  I have normal skin and don't wear makeup but I do spend money to take care of my skin.  I've been using Philosphy Purity made simple for the past few years and I'll stick with that. I have this 2 stars because one star for the scent and one star for the large tube and nice looking tube.  It's just not for me.  It felt like I had rubbed my face with oil.	-1
The description says "can be used with or without water," so I tried it both ways.  Without water left my skin feeling greasy, so I began rinsing it off.  Unfortunately, neither method was good for my skin.  Shortly after I began using this cleanser, my skin broke out--a lot.  I then began using the 3-in-1 simply as a makeup remover and then using my regular skincare regimen after.  That's how I discovered that this cleanser was actually leaving a lot of makeup behind which is probably why I was breaking out so much.  Although I like the milky feel when putting it on, this product simply doesn't work for my skin.	-1
Like many women I am in search of the face product that will give me lovely skin. I'm sure my expectations are out of whack with reality, but I'm also sure I will get the same non-result from a gentle soap and water. I would not waste money on this.	-1
This product isn't my favorite. While it definitely gives my face a clean feel, it also leaves a strange film behind. I'm also not a big fan of the scent. It's citrusy, which isn't totally offensive, but has some underlying "other" scent that makes it smell like grandma's perfume. Another biggee, on the front of the bottle, it says it's "cleansing, makeup removing, and purifying." When I think of a makeup remover, I'm thinking that it can be used for eye makeup. Do NOT use this on your eyes, it stings!  My Neutrogena toner and grocery store generic makeup remover are preferable to this product. I'd rather spend the money on these two products I know work than buy this one that's just so so.	-1
I really like La Roche-Posay's foaming micellar cleanser do I figured I'd give this a shot. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of this. It smells like cheap hand soap and did not live up to the hype.  It didn't remove my make up, and it surprisingly made my skin MORE oily.	-1
I made a mistake in getting this product. I saw clay mask and quickly jumped. So when it arrived and said it was for men I was a little disappointed. I had to turn around and tell my husband that it was imperative that he let me slather this all over his face. He wasn't extremely happy with me but he yielded with the exception that he apply it.  Once he washed his face he applied the slightest film and I kept telling him to apply more. His first reaction was, well that's cost effective. So that being said, I've used a lot of masks myself and I noticed that this one seemed to separate and didn't look like my own masks when drying. So I decided to try it for myself using a bit more product with the same results. This definitely leaves the skin soft which is what I love in masks but I'm not sure it did much else. After a few applications I didn't notice any difference with my husbands face.  I'll certainly make him continue this routine and insist that he use it until it's gone but I'm not sure if that will change the results any. For now I'm not majorly impressed. I think for the price I could find him something at the drug store that would work the same if not better for a fraction of the price. I myself use a mask that's approximately $10 more with way better results. That brand also has a line for men and if I really pushed the matter I would purchase that for my husband.	-1
This is a men's mask.  And my husband was not impressed.  I thought that it might be nice for him since he works outside and his handsome face takes such a beating.  He did use another product of mine that doesn't dry on the face.it was more of a cream mask.  This mask is nothing special, even when we glopped a lot on it was still a thin layer.  We avoided his beard and stache. He was not a fan of the smell and initially wanted to take it off right away.  He said it smelled like the talcum powder in his grandma's bathroom.  After waiting for the mask to dry we washed it off and it took several rinses and a washcloth to really get it off.  His skin was softer.  But he said it didn't like the feeling, his skin felt dry.  All and all he was not impressed.  He thought the idea of a men's face care line was great, but ultimately the product was not for him.	-1
I have become confused on what exactly the point of this product is. I saw some feedback on people who use it as a cleanser on those days where you want to "rush" off or just go to bed without washing your face, but this makes no sense to me. These pads are astringent toner pads, not cleanser pads. They will not provide you with a cleanse, that is why on the directions it says use after cleansing, but before moisturizer. If you wash your face then use these pads it will not make your skin dry, but rather kind of sticky. If you try and put any sort of moisturizer on after the pads it will make your face look disgusting. Like you haven't showered in about 2 days, very greasy. I attempted to use just the pads and no moisturizer, but my face just looked oily and felt very sticky. Now I think girls like a man with a nice smooth face, not one that feels dirty. I shave everyday so I expect that smooth feeling day in and day out, and that is exactly what I had before these pads. I stumbled upon this item when doing a search for a good toner and saw all the fantastic reviews so I purchased them, what a mistake. I stopped using them yesterday and my skin is back to being a little dry and I actually don't mind it. Much better than looking dirty and oily. I will say on the plus that these pads don't burn at all even when used after shaving, for those who care I shave with a DE feather blade which can be very harsh on skin, and it helps with razor burn on the neck by healing it faster. This is when the ingredient witch hazel comes into play (ingredient in the product). That's the only plus I have to mention about these pads. I really have no idea where the target market for this product is, as I can only image what it would do for someone with oily skin or normal skin (my skin is very dry). Pads cover the entire face and neck with no problems, just be sure to flip the pad over half way through so you get the most out of the pads.	-1
It's always preferable when trying a new scent to wait approximately 1/2 hour to see how your body reacts.  While I'm certain that this Juicy Couture Eau de Parfum Spray will be fine on some individuals, I found it to be too cloying and sweet for my taste.  I much prefer my signature Mitsouko by Guerlain or the very difficult to find, Kingdom by Alexander McQueen.	-1
I have a multitude of "designer deodorants" and while this has absolutely NO SCENT it caused a reaction on my skin. I've never had this issue with ANY deodorant before however I will never purchase this deodorant again.	-1
Didnt see and feel what I read in most of the reviews, I have curly hair, not very thick but freeze. Not for me	-1
I wanted to like this product. I tried it a couple times, but I just can't use it any more. It's got great ingredients and did make my skin soft and for that I give it the 2 stars. For me though, first of all, I really didn't like the scent. I'm not sure what it was about it that didn't please me, but it certainly didn't smell good to my nose. Secondly, the moisturizer felt really heavy and slithery on my skin and felt like it didn't absorb very well.  I guess that's really all I have to say. So, for the price, I would not buy this product. Read the other reviews though, this may be just personal preference.	-1
While this moisturizer has some good ingredients and an acceptable aroma, it feels sticky on the skin well after applying and doesn't really absorb as well as it should - which is saying something in my case because my dry skin tends to suck up all moisture that even comes close.  I also have sensitive skin, and it kinda burns just a little.  I really WANTED to like this product after looking at the list of organic ingredients, but I just don't.	-1
Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum is too much for my sensitive skin.  Other non-sensitive Juice products do not irritate my skin the way this does.  It is pleasant to apply, but it did leave my skin in a fussier state.  A closer peek at the ingredients revealed salicylic acid (from white willow bark), which is an ingredient that my skin tends to rebel against.	-1
I'll be honest that I selected this item from the Vine program mostly for the serum and less for the face clearing since I don't really have acne, just the occasional breakout. The problem I have is that every time I do get a blemish, the spot, even when healed takes forever to fade and I have been looking for something that fades and evens out those spots.  I decided to try the whole "system" and after the first use, I have opted not to use it again. First, the smell is unpleasant, or at least it was to me. Perhaps extended use would work wonders for the skin, but I am unable to stomach the smell so that's something. I used the cleanser, serum and moisturizer, just as indicted in the instructions. After the first and only use, my skin felt dry with an odd texture - hard to explain, not exactly smooth or silky or very sticky (just a little sticky), just weird. Then I started to itch and feel tingling. Not good tingling, more burning, rashy tingling. Nothing that I'd ever want to feel again. I did not try the peel, one whiff and I felt nauseated. I will use the bamboo washcloth again, however. It's really great.  So while this may have long-term benefits, I am unable (unwilling) to re-use this.  I urge every potential buyer to read ALL reviews before purchasing this product. Although some people used this with good results, the manufacturer does not seem like it cares or is customer friendly or even willing to help those people who had legitimate customer service issues.  I cannot recommend this product.	-1
I should have known it was a bad sign when the box came completely open and destroyed. Thankfully everything inside was still wrapped so I decided to give it a try anyway. Within a few days I saw my skin get redder and more sensitive than it ever was before. I don't know if there's something in the products I was allergic to, but I had to quit it.	-1
I asked my daughter to try this skin kit out.  She has problem skin.  She told me that she likes the cleanser which made her skin feel tighter and tingling clean, she had nothing good to say about the moisturizer. She didn't like the smell, and also thought the moisturizer was way too thick.  We don't understand why someone concerned with acne would want a moisturizer so thick that it may clog facial pores.  She saw no improvement in her skin with these products.  So no recommendation for this skin care kit.	-1
In the past, I have used Juice Beauty's moisturizer and was so pleased with it I thought ordering this acne set for my teenager would be a no-brainer. Boy, was I wrong!   First, I must address the odor issue. The face wash and acne clearing serum smelled absolutely rancid.  When we first opened the acne clearing serum tube, the content came squirting and losing out. The serum was very liquidy, like water with smelly brown grains.  It looked like  puddle water and smelled like pond scum.  I immediately checked the date on the box, but we weren't near expiration.  I don't think the serum should have had the consistency our tube had.   My son decided to try it despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.  Despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.   I would not  recommend the acne kit.  Frankly, buying good old Noxzema, Ckearisil, or Neutrogena is the better way to go	-1
Was not impressed - but would probably be a good fit for someone with more sensitive skin. I needed more than this.	-1
September Update  Ultimately I was unable to continue using ANY of the products from JB. Emailed. The company is more interested in taking your $ and refuse to refund any of my purchases - even though I can't use any of them. So not only was I brushed off but I was outright told I could not get a refund even though they push clients to use the products passed the 45 day refund period. This company does not back their product. They will encourage you to use something else on their line OR continue using the acne kit, stating on the website, it can take several weeks (i.e. well over a month) to see if the "purge" will subside. A GOOD company would refund customers who are dissatisfied and having serious reactions to their products. I will warn you now, buy it, but be aware that getting a refund will be nearly impossible if your have problems.  ******** Seems the good people at JB are too busy to address my issue with their product so I found it best to forewarn anyone thinking about trying this product of my experience thus far. I've been acne plagued for more than 2 count them 2 decades. I've tried everything with continued disappointment including anything my dermatologist recommended. I decided to get this on a whim and the first week or so it "seemed" to show improvement.  Now, many people say with a new product there may be a "purging" stage where the acne is cycling thru and eventually it'll leave you with better looking skin thereafter. So far my "purge" is the worst my acne has ever looked and is emerging in places I've never had acne. How can that be? One thing to tell me my regular acne or hidden acne will pop up faster during a purge, but explain the logic behind acne on parts of my face never seen? My face has been completely ravaged and I'm on my 2nd month.  When I posted something with JB hoping to get assistance, I got nothing, nana, zip. Seems they were just more happy to have suckered me into a 2nd month and didn't feel the need to help out someone who could potentially be a lifelong customer IF this horrible purge ever passes because I'm pretty determined. Instead, I'm left to assume it'll either get better in the next 30 days or I'll need to go to another product. If it improves I'll keep it - but as it's looking (which is pretty darn nasty at the moment) I'll likely employ their so-called return policy - again I just have to see if this purge is a myth or not. I've had similar breakouts, but nothing like this.  I've used this regime religiously - alas just getting worse for now - all over my forehead (never break out there), all over my jawline (painful, scarring red patches on both sides), all around my lips. I've pretty much had to cut out make up most days because it makes it look like scabbed, uneven pavement.  The product - ok, the facewash is good. Doesn't dry out your face the moment you towel it off. Smells kinda lemon-esk to me. Nothing to write home about - functional, more than enough to get you through several dozen washes. The serum - so far I'm not seeing any improvements related to the would-be acne fighter. A little goes a long way. The lotion is mighty sticky, weird, very oil-free - so much so it'll suck the surface of your skin dry. I find my face is oilier in the middle of the day using this regime. If it were really balancing it wouldn't be nearly like the oil slick that it is. I have to constantly blot my acne prone, combination skin with those oil-absorbing sheets. Didn't have to do that as often before.  I'm afraid by the time I finally "grow out of" my acne it'll be time for wrinkle cream. Anyway, overall the product seems fine - the only item out of the entire kit I'd repurchase at this point - considering I'm still in the dreaded purge - is the facial peel. I love the peel. I could just about eat it out of the jar. Again, I use it as recommended and it seems to help the acne (when applied at night). The morning after when I awake the acne appears diminished. Then a couple days later I have a whole new crop of white and red beauties to remind me this kit isn't working out very well. Be prepared to be snubbed by JB after they've gotten your money because that's how I feel.  I'll consider editing my review at the end of next month - I'll be officially through two whole months & we'll see where my face is then.  *****  August Update Ultimately, I gave up using this kit other than the peel and the blemish clearing stick (which you'd buy separately). Only using up what I have left of the peel as I've found one made with similar ingredients for WAY less than what the standard jar costs. And ounce for ounce the stick isn't exceptional.  The products overall, I'm sad to say, never completely eliminated my problem: high cost - no real results. Had it, obviously I would be raving about it and not complaining about the cost (when you invest in the standard bottles). When will these companies get that if something really works people will happily pay for it - so long as it's reasonable? Anyway, I gave up on the all natural toner & have moved onto trying the Clinique acne kit in hopes it may slay my acne beast. But that's a new regime for me and thus I can't say for sure how it's going as of yet.  My JB purge was so damaging that my dark marks are still healing and I took a little break in-between the kits by washing with mild facewash and spot treating. Additionally, I developed noticeable blackheads which I'd never really had a problem with before JB.  Ideally, I'd like to think this JB kit could work for someone, but not if you have sensitive + oily skin. I'm assessing my "purge" was my skin reacting poorly to the product. However, many are vague as to how to distinguish between a reaction and a so called purge - if the purge actually exists, you know. Therefore, I suggest if you are breaking out in places you typically don't you may be having a poor reaction to something in the product. If you are an oil slick 30 days into "testing" a new regime, you're likely not acclimating to it well. That was the case for me anyway.	-1

Generally speaking, I love this line but this product should not be called a scrub it. It should not even be sold. The sporadic sharp grains of almonds are very abrasive and my skin can take almost any scrub. In fact I rarely find an affective scrub. This so-called scrub however is ineffectual in every way. Baking soda delivers way more value.	-1
I needed to change my review. After a few weeks of use- I have broken out worse than anything in my life. My skin has never been in this bad of shape in my life even in my teenage years! Bioelements and I clearly do not work well. I switched back to Dermalogica and instantly cleared up. Never switching again in my life.	-1
The lipstick was broken when I got it so now I can only apply it with my finger.  Most of it was broken off in the lid.  Bummer.	-1
This product will mess up your hair as if you've been to the beach, but your hair will smell very strongly perfumed. I don't use it anymore because of overwhelming scent.	-1
made my hair soooooo dry and stiff. felt awful.	-1
I found this shampoo difficult to lather. I really had to use a lot to get even a small lather. This does not perform consistently for me and the price is too high. I have thick hair anyway, so I did not notice much of a change in the thickness/quality of my hair. I won't be buying this again.	-1
Tried this after becoming very disappointed with the AOS (art of shaving) shaving cream line. This wasn't the solution. Ingredient list has all the right stuff, but I find the lather to be extremely weak. Very very small layer of protection even when I use a generous amount of cream. Can't even use my badger brush and a bowl to bring a healthy lather, just won't work. Experimented with proper amounts of water several times to see if I could find the right consistency, but could never find it. I would amount this to being the shaving cream. I will continue my search as this product just wasn't for me. The art of shaving provides a better leather, but is very drying. This product makes canned gillette creams look like the "cream of the crop".	-1
I love most of Jack Black's products but I feel like this one is a miss for me.  They call it a lather but it hardly lathers at all.  For the price, I want superior protection which I feel it did not provide so it looks like I'm going back to gels.	-1
Was really thick like old Chapstick.  Probably won't buy anymore since you get like three sticks with the kit. Not moist	-1
you have to use a lot if you have thick hair and for the price point it's not worth it. the peppermint essential oils in this are too concentrated and will burn your eyes	-1
Wow, this bottle is SO TINY - I didn't realize how small it was going to be. I was looking for an alternative to dry shampoos that use alcohol. I tried it, not impressed. Smell is ok.	-1
Powder color is off, much lighter than expected, not the same as I have gotten before but should be. Can not compare to Bare Minerals.	-1
Made under my eyes very dry.	-1
I don't think this minimized my pores that much unfortunately.	-1
Didn't do anything for me - didn't change the appearance of my pores at all.	-1
I ordered honey bronze and got this color,called and did not receive good help. I went back to order really watching what I was doing and every time I put in honey bronze  it went back to golden glow, so I went to ebay  you should check that site.	-1
I have combination skin and a little redness/rosacea going on. The color warm sienna took care of the redness, but got very oily in the T-zone. So, I bought the Absence oil control to wear under the makeup. The Absence makes the color whiter, as it is white and doesn't control the oil enough. Absence is very hard to apply too little does nothing, too much, it looks white and adds flaking......I'm not too happy	-1
I had bought this scent in reed diffusers, and absolutely loved it. So when I saw a room spray - visions of vanilla & bourbon danced in my head. Sadly to say the scent lasts for a whole whopping minute :( What a huge waste of money.	-1
Awful color!!	-1
It's hard to give an objective review when I've only been able to use this about five times before the tip wore down rendering it unusable as I need very thin, soft strokes which a stub cannot give.  There was no sharpener in the package I received. I tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked (they only wore down the tip). The lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements (texture, color, look when applied, price/value ratio) that are a part of evaluating this pencil's effectiveness.  I've used a wide variety of eyebrow pencils over the years at a variety of price points. The best are easy to apply in that they don't seem to cake or clump and go on evenly (with a well-sharpened tip) and don't smudge; you can shape the tip as needed to give thicker or thinner lines. The consistency (a bit waxy but not too much), which you can't try before you buy, is a key factor in both application and longevity, once applied.  Other than the color itself, there's nothing that I liked about this product. Which is disappointing as this is a good brand and I've used other Longo products and been satisfied with their performance. It's especially disappointing given the price point.  Application: Not as easy as other pencils, which is due, in part, I think, to the consistency (waxy, clumpy) and the size of the tip (too small and chubby and not thin enough to my liking).  Texture: Not as smooth as other pencils I've used. Took longer to apply and had to keep smudging and fiddling with Q-tips to get a neat line. Didn't go on "evenly."  Look when applied: Seemed heavier and line was not as strong and consistent. Getting a thin line was very difficult (again, an issue of consistency and size/shape of product tip)  Color: This was a really good color for me, even though I have medium brown hair. I have found that many products labeled "blonde" are the right shade either alone or when used to lighten up a darker color.  Price/Value: Simply not there for me. I've had better application, better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper. But since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me. I have thin-ish brows and need thin, really feathery lines, which this could not deliver.	-1
I have used a lot of different brow products over time, and one thing that I have a difficult time finding is a brow product that does not settle into the skin, pores, or smear while wearing in the day.  I have used the Vincent Longo Blonde Micro Pencil for several weeks now and I have to say that it does not wear well.  The pencil goes in nicely with very fine lines and it is easy to apply and make faux hairs in the brow area.  The color is nice- very close to MAC Lingering or Tarte Taupe brow pencils in color.  The pencil itself is very thin, which means that you have to use a special sharpener.  The sharpener is not attached at all to the pencil, so if you lose it, you are out of luck.  I don't like that feature.  What I have found with this pencil is that despite it looking very close in color to the other two which I have previously mentioned, it does not wear as well.  I have done one brow with this pencil and a different one on the other.  At the end of the day, the other brand is still good, but the Vincent Longo pencil is smeary, spotty, and seems to have settled into my pores a bit too.  I do not have oily skin.  For the price, I don't think that this brow pencil works for me anyway.  Nice color, but very disappointing wear time.  I don't want to have to try that hard with any brow products. I prefer to apply and not have to think about it for the rest of the day.	-1
Feels like antiseptic lotion. Not hip on it. Won't buy again. However it's a large tube	-1
If you are looking at this product because somehow the name implies that it's 'water' and therefore better than say, something with silicone? It's not. It has silicone.  I've used a ton of primers, from cheap to pricey. This one falls somewhere towards the lower end of wear for me. I have combination skin (older skin to boot but I use peels) and this primer made my foundation patchy after a few hours. I'm currently wearing Lancme Teinte Idole 24Hr over their Lancme-branded Pro base. The Lancme foundation slid around on the Vincent Longo base. I normally get about 12 hours of uninterrupted wear out of the Lancme otherwise.  It did feel nice going on, and it smelled pleasant. But wear? Didn't do anything good for me.	-1
I have had the occasion to use several Vincent Longo products and I realize that this line of products provides a high quality product for a pretty hefty price.  In most situations I have found you get a really good product for your investment.  However, in this case, I am just not sure about this one.  SIZE Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base comes in a black tube which looks pretty nice on the product page, but in reality, when you get it, the small size is rather shocking. There is only .88 oz of product in the tube, which if you translate it, you can imagine three tubes of Jack Black lip balm and that is about the size of this product.  TEXTURE I have tried many times to see what might be different about this primer compared to many others out there.  I have to say after testing this repeatedly, I just don't see any advantage of using this primer.  The feel of this product is that you use a pearl sized drop of this product applied around your entire face and eyes.  When I do this, I feel a lot of silicone feel to it.  This leaves my face feeling like it has saran wrap on it of sorts.  It is hard to explain, but after a while of wearing this primer, I feel like my face wants to breathe and I want to remove it.  AFFECT ON MAKEUP  This primer base definitely does smooth out the skin and does allow for the foundation and other face makeup to stay on the face nicely.  It seems to make the makeup stay on well through the day and it does add to a nice appearance of the skin.  I also find when using this, that blush does not tend to change color like some other primers can do.  I still did not enjoy wearing it over time, however, so I am not sure it served that great of a purpose.  FINAL COMMENTS  For the price, I just don't see how this product is worth the money.  I have normal to dry skin and I didn't feel any particular moisturizing features from this base.  I get much nicer results when using Swanson Vitamins Hyaluronic Acid Serum which is very similar to Lorac Aquaprime which was discontinued.  I just don't like this primer and didn't feel it is worth the investment.  You get so little product for a very high price.  Using it under Vincent Longo Water Canvas Foundation does make it look very nice, however, if you have the money to invest and want to use them together.  There are other options that are more cost effective, however if you prefer a less expensive alternative base to use.	-1
Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base takes the saying "a little goes a long way" a little too seriously. This tiny tube of foundation base is not worth $45.00, not to me anyway. Yes, it's creates a nice soft feeling on your skin but it did not help my makeup stay put or minimize pores like other, less expensive bases and primers. It actually felt like glycerin which you can pick up anywhere for a fraction of this price. I didn't notice any difference in the final look with or without it. I was very disappointed and could not imagine ever purchasing or recommending Canvas Base, not when there are plenty of products available that do the job perfectly.	-1
Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base is a product that is touted to ensure that makeup goes on smoothly, will protect skin with moisture, and reduce the appearance of fine lines.  Using the product, I tried differing application methods: Over slightly moist skin Over patted dry skin  Application method: Small amount gently applied Small amount gently worked into the skin til almost absorption More generous application in problem areas  Followed by: Moisturizer No Moisturizer  Followed by: Regular foundation Oil free foundation  Followed by: Light dusting of mineral based powder  In every method: There was no pore refinement, nor reduction in the appearance of fine lines My makeup did not set in the light coverage I strive for Moisturized initially, but did not seem to be as good as my other products (tried on neck area for this assessment)  While this product did not irritate my skin, I found no benefit for this pricey offering.	-1
On the one hand, this product doesn't burn or cause skin irritation. On the other hand, it doesn't do anything at all.	-1
The exfoliating quality of Baxter of California Night Cream AHA comes from this lotion's glycolic acid base, which is a very mild alpha hydroxyl formulation.  After several weeks of use, I saw no redness as I've experienced with other exfoliants.  But neither did I see any real change in my skin.  I like the feel of it:  non-oily, dry, almost talc-y. Dense, yet easily spreadable.  And a dab covers quite a bit of territory.  But after 30 minutes, my skin feels no different than before.  Night Cream AHA is not entirely odorless for me;  it's got an elusive "nearly chemical" fragrance.  I'm grateful it's not spicy, floral, herb-like, or overly medicinal, and I'm also grateful it's not long-lasting.  My spouse said, "It feels nice, non-greasy, and unobjectionable".  But something about Baxter's Night Cream AHA is bothering my eyes, causing unusual dryness and minor stinging.  This happens even though I apply the product far, FAR from my eyes and even if I just put it on the back of my hand.  So I started looking into the list of ingredients, which I included below.  Some compounds - such as certain fatty alcohols - may be derived from animals or plants.  BOC makes no claim that the Night Cream AHA is vegan, so there is no reason to expect that it is.  Other ingredients like hydrogenated polyisobutene have used animals in testing (and yes, there were deaths).  Still others - sorbitan stearate, glyceryl stearate, and cetyl alcohol - have been considered toxic and environmentally dangerous in Canada.  Then there are the four (FOUR) parabens, i.e. preservatives, recently associated with breast tumors.  Granted, parabens have not been found to _cause_ cancer, and they can exist naturally in some foods (grapes, flaxseed) and even show up in some OTC pain relievers.  But Denmark has seen fit to ban butylparaben from certain child-oriented products.  The fact that BOC chooses to use FOUR parabens is worrisome.  This uneasy ingredient list, along with no visible results except for the dry, stinging eyes, makes me happier to just do without BOC right now.  It was a nice-to-have that was nice to try, but ultimately it might not be so nice to Earth and animals.  Humans included.  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  Ingredients  Water (Aqua), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycolic Acid, PEG-100 Stearate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Benzophenone-3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Dipalmitoyl Hydroxyproline, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Wheat Amino Acids, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Fragrance (Parfum), Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).	-1
Other reviewers commented that this product was very thick - and they did not mean that in a good way.  I'm not sure I'd call it very thick. It seemed more sticky than thick to me. Very hard to massage into the skin. Seemed almost as if the components were not well mixed. I did not like it.  I might try to add some water and/or other moisturizer and see if that improves the situation, rather than throw the tube away, but I don't think I'd recommend it to others.	-1
Smells nice but made my skin too oily...  Not sure if it was Pevonia's toner or this cream, or the combination of both, but my skin didn't like the ingredients and reacted adversely.	-1
Pevonia moisturizers are great, but the peels are not that effective.	-1
I used the 3 piece kit and did not see substantial results on my skin. I have acne prone skin.	-1
This stuff gave me a terrible rash on my chest. Definitely not for use if you have sensitive skin. I started out using it every day. Then went to once every other day. Rash didn't start to clear up until I stopped use altogether.	-1
I've bought several of the NIA skin care products; I bought this product from a medi spa where these products were really being pushed. I applied it exactly as directed and a few hours later broke out in pus-filled hives to all areas applied to...decolletage & throat,hands,forearms,neck and lower face. Now you may think...maybe it was something else that made the hives pop up? ...but the thing was you could actually see exactly where my hands & fingers had applied it to my skin and it happened 2 x's, the first time I was not sure it was this product,Sun Damage Repair Decolletage & Hands...but you could see the trail of where my hand & fingers had applied it...all red w/ small pustule-like bumps/hives...it left brown spots after healing. It left my skin damaged w/ brown spots where the pustules/hives had been...now I have to do TCA peels to remove the brown scarring I was left with. I will not use this again and I'm using up other NIA24 products and going back to exclusively to Perricone. I am ok with some of the other NIA24 products but they do seem to contain high amounts of waxy substances that leave a residue on my facial skin. Not just disappointed with this...upset!	-1
Not a huge fan.  I don't like the smell of this cream.  It is rich and works OK, but I prefer other products that I currently have/use.  This one I used on really dry skin and it kinda burned.  I will not use it again.	-1
While I was placing a few orders on Amazon my friend asked if I could order her the trial size Vichy since she doesn't have prime.long story short when I took it out of the padded envelope the top was not only cracked but also it was completely off. This wasn't sealed and most of the product was in the envelope! Threw it away and will not repurchase.	-1
Below average moisturizer! How can they get away with false advertising? If I could get my money back I would!	-1
Well it feels nice :) But I have very sensitive skin and it made me break out right away...first night. I wish I could use it...smells great, feels great...but pimples :)	-1
No hold, not happy at all with this product.	-1
I originally wrote a good review for this product as it seemed to diminish wrinkles, however be aware:  I went to my dermatologist showed her attached pic and she also had recent pics of my neck.  She said there's a chemical that decreases fatty tissues which is why it's not recommended for face.  She suggested I use remaining product for my elbows, knew, and buttocks.  I have a Long, thin neck with little fatty tissues.  I'm now paying for Fraxell to go back to where I was before Nectifirm.	-1
Its smooth and feels good and has a mild nice fragrance but it has done nothing and I'm not surprised. Nothing is going to fix creapy necks. Wishful thinking is so expensive. Things that work best for me are specific  neck exercise to create bloodflow, stay away from prolonged sunshine , watch your posture and eat healthy fats...We're all different and we all will age but let's do it slowly!	-1
I bought this at the dermatology clinic and tried it for 8 weeks ......nothing changed nothing Im 55 and my neck looks the same, very disappointing! It is good as a moisturizer and thats it.	-1
Been using 2 times per day for 2 months with no visible changes. Will try a different brand.	-1
I used 2 jars of this and did not see much of a difference.  Maybe a teeny bit but not enough to continue using.  Maybe had I discovered this years ago and incorporated it into my routine it would make a difference but I think genetics win in my case.  Product goes on smooth and has not much scent so it's nice, but just didn't seem to work for me.	-1
I saw no improvement which was a big disappointment....it is a little tacky to put on but I wish I had improvement..hope others do since I know everyone is different when it comes to topicals	-1
I was disappointed in how this cream performed based on the price I had to pay at the "Cosmetic Dermatologist's" office! It was $68 for 1.7 oz of the Revision Nectifirm cream, and unfortunately I saw NO difference in my neck what so ever!  I really, really wanted the Nectifirm to work! I'm an otherwise young looking woman, and was horrified when my neck seemed to lose the elasticity it had previously had after I lost some weight. I have a small area between my chin and neck that I've tried everything on, but I suppose when the priorities in life are taken care of, if I still have that small problem area I can have some type of skin treatment.  Anyway, my BIG complaint isn't with the cream, or the manufacturer, it's with the doctor! She sold me the cream, but didn't tell me you had to use it in a particular way! I just happened to be on YouTube one day and happened to find a Necktifirm video! They had a method for using the cream, and it was very specific. I was 1/2 way though the cream, and used the remainder the way it was prescribed in the video, but didn't feel I'd really know if I'd have had any better benefit if I'd have used the cream in the specified way the entire time.  Even though I didn't know there was a process to using the cream, I had to assume I wouldn't have seen any further improvement with the first 1/2 jar, and just chalked it up to live and learn! I've tried many creams and lotions... I have no problems with them as long as they smell good and absorb well - in other words they don't just sit on top of my skin if they're supposed to soak in with their special "nanosphooses" or "hydrofloofers". If I'm paying more than drug store price for some newly discovered chemical complex or supposed stem cell therapy, I want to "SEE" a pleasant difference, as well as feel a nice difference!  The doctor told me this is the only cream that has been FDA approved to lift and improve the skin tone of the aging neck. I don't know whether or not that's true, and I won't take her word for it, or base my review on what she's said.  I can only say that the cream had a very light pleasant scent and felt very nice, absorbing well and quickly. Based on this I would recommend the cream, but based on lifting and firming of the neck, I can't recommend it.  I will continue to look, and would appreciate hearing about anyone else's experiences with products that do work really well on the neck for lifting and tightening the skin.	-1
Broke out.	-1
I love all coola products. This however had the consistency of the correct product but felt like it had sand in it.... it felt like an exfoliating scrub. I tried to use it as long as I could but my face was raw after a few days. I will continue to buy my coola products directly from birchbox as to avoid wasting money.	-1
Active Ingredients Avobenzone (Sunscreen) 2.0% Octinoxate (Sunscreen) 2.1%  Inactive Ingredients Caprylohydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Oleosomes, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (ORGANIC Orange) Fruit Water, Cucumis Sativus (ORGANIC Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Euterpe Oleracea (ORGANIC Acai) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Glycerin (ORGANIC), Helianthus Annuus (ORGANIC Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Linum Usitatissimum (ORGANIC Linseed) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis (ORGANIC Evening Primrose) Oil, Plankton Extract, Propanediol, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Trideceth-10, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Water, Xanthan Gum.  Organic Ingredients Orange Fruit Water Acai Fruit Oil Strawberry Fruit Extract Cucumber Fruit Extract Glycerin Sunflower Seed Extract Linseed Oil Evening Primrose Oil  Zero% ZO mix with bunch of additives is hardly anything except chemicals. 97% organic with 18% ZO, the best protection which costs few times less than Coola with no chemicals. Their mix is hardly organic and one needs to ask, do you really need to put fragrance on you skin when looking for protection from the sun as well as all other chemicals Propanediol, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Trideceth-10, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Water, Xanthan Gum. The main ingredients are Avobenzone and Octinoxate, you can purchase that in mixes for tenth of the cost as Coola.  Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.  SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.  I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO. Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane.	-1
I love PCA products and have mild rosacea that worsens at times with redness on my cheeks and red bumps. I wanted this serum to work - but I used the entire bottle and saw no difference - and sometimes the serum stung a bit going on. I believe in giving all products - no matter what they are - 90 days to assess. So, I"m on my second bottle - and will determine if it's worth repurchasing. But I think my best bet is to invest in laser therapy for the redness - and no serum or cream has worked for me. The thing I do like about it - is that it gives some moisturization to my dry skin.	-1
They have a great thing going with this cleansing cream, you have to use twice or three times what they suggest.  It does not lather at all.  I will not buy it again.	-1
Too rough for my sensitive skin...	-1
The size of the brush I received was somewhere between a small and a medium sized brush - not even close to an XL.	-1
Did nothing for me. I have curly frizzy hair.  No help from this product.	-1
didnt work for me moving on from Mario Badescu tried multiple products nothing worked!	-1
Does not work as well on break-outs as thought.	-1
I've heard very good things about this brand, and was excited to try this cleanser. I'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so I keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). This cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal.  Pros: 1. Only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer 2. Rinses clean, without residue 3. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin 4. Doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean 5. Doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse  Cons: 1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the "cooling action" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the "cleansing" part. 2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes. 3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something. 4. Expensive. Considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. I've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. If I'm spending more, I'd rather invest in Algenist or La Mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).  Overall, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this cleanser.	-1
I am a cosmetic and bath junkie, but also care about what ingredients are in my products.  I was concerned that Petrolatum is the 2nd ingredient listed.  I googled Petrolatum and what I read, confirmed my fears.  I just wish they'd not use Petrolatum as the 2nd ingredient after sugar :(	-1
Don't like that Petrolatum is the 2nd ingredient.  Wish they'd use a better product as part of the base.  There are so many wonderful skin-loving, nourishing oils and butters out there, but I am just not thrilled about the Petrolatum being the main ingredient (other than sugar)	-1
I have been married for close to 24 years, and hubby has always used Edge Sensitive Gel, no matter what razor. But after my great experience with a Vichy facial serum, he figured that it was worth trying this. He used it once and tossed it. His skin was irritated, especially his neck, which was scraped and red, and his shave was not as close with the same razor.	-1
I use shaving soap and a brush/mug when I'm home.  This is a high quality, inexpensive system, but it doesn't travel well.  On the road, I generally use a can of gel, which is more expensive, messier, and slower than a brush and soap.  This stuff is more expensive than gel, doesn't lubricate as well, and is more difficult to apply because it doesn't "stick" as easily to wet skin.  I give it two stars because I'm going to use the rest of the can, but I sure won't be buying any more.	-1
Came and the bottle was smashed up and it was empty.	-1
I was soo disappointed with this OPI product. My nail polish chipped worse than if I'd not used anything at all. It didn't seem to work as a base OR top coat effectively. I was able to get a refund - thank goodness at $14 for one tiny bottle!	-1
The polish is okay but the brush separated from the cap the second time I opened it.  Now the black cap twists off and I have to use an instrument or pliers to remove the brush from the polish.	-1
This stuff is seriously awful. I was looking for a change from ORLY top to bottom because of its bluish tone and bought this. I didn't need to straighten my nails, but thought that something extra is always a plus. Now I'm ready to cry... I used it only one time and six of my nails broke. My nail polish started chipping after one day of wear. It was chipping with upper part of my nails. Now I have cracked, damaged awful nails that I haven't had in years. This product can't be called nail straightener it should be called nail killer! DON'T BUY IT!	-1
I bought this at Ulta, even though the Amazon price was much less. I can't recommend it! First of all, it's somewhat underpowered for anyone with thick hair. Second, the curl-release feature worked less than half the time and I wound up having to physically untangle and pull my hair out of the plastic bristle brush. Third, the "cap" that holds the plastic brush on the base, flew off almost right away and I had to search the bathroom for it and screw it back on. It is not an expensive product, but it's not even worth what it cost. It's a "cheap" product in a number of ways.	-1
