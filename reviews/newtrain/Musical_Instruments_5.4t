Great!	1
Does what it says!  I live the rounded edges and more streamlined apperance,  it dosnt jump out and scream look what someone stuck to this fine guiitar,  like some of the brightly colored plastic ones on the market seem to do,  this is obviously higher quality.  Well made,  a nice spring inside its practically invisible but there to slip out a pick on the fly whenever you need one!	1
It's a simple product. It holds picks...  One thing though, don't fill it up with really thin picks or it will bend them.	1
Man, this thing is easily the highest quality strap I've ever seen.  It's thick without being too heavy, and the smooth texture of the fabric ensures it will allow you to adjust your guitar hold easily without ruffin' up your shirt.  The leather ends are thick and take some effort to get them on, but now I know they won't pop off.  It's because of this strap that I now pay more attention to the Jim Dunlop brand.	1
Long, cheap and it works just like it is supposed to. Its very flexible. This is not the cable you should be using if you a gigging musician but if all you need is something for around the house and such this should do perfectly. Highly recommended it.	1
I've had these cables for around a year now and they're still working strong. These planetwaves are great for any musician that wants good cables at an affordable price. Get these and rock on !!	1
At first I really liked this cable. Coils well, doesn't tangle, solid connection. After a couple months of regular use (I play shows & rehearsals every week), it died without warning in the middle of a show. In fact, it died just after the return window closed with Amazon, so I contacted Planet Waves about their lifetime warranty. I was notified I'd have to ship it to them at my expense in order to get a replacement. Being that it would cost nearly as much to ship it as I'd paid in the first place, I decided to take the loss and move on. I've had good results using other Planet Waves products, but I won't be purchasing any more of their cables. Totally unreliable.	-1
Very well made, and very durable. You won't regret purchasing from Planet Waves.	1
The cable died on me in less than a month. Very disappointed in built quality.	-1
Works	1
There's not much to say other than it works and it is less expensive than the other ones. It is a good product!	1
Great Product.  I have about 8 of these.  Works perfectly and made with great materials.  It comes with 2 long drywall screws and 2 wall anchors that screw into the drywall.  Love it!	1
this product works just fine..spring loaded...so load the picks up...wish they would hold a couple more...but im happy...i keep in guitar case  and very handy to have...enjoy	1
I use Clayton 1.26mm picks, a heavy pick but certainly not oversized. My picks don't fit!!! If I shove them in, I can't get them out. Also, this thing is huge for the back of the neck.	-1
As with all Dunlop products this pickholder is fair priced and functional.  It does what it is intended to do, holds my picks!  It actually works well.  The picks go in and come out nicely.	1
I bought this so I can keep some extra picks handy... now if I can just decide where to adhere it, to my guitar or my music stand?  Or to the desk where I sit and play?  Maybe I should just get one for each spot and each instrument...  Yeah, I think a few of these would be nice.	1
The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument.	1
The problem with this pickholder is that the opening is a bit TOO open.  If you use any textured or raised-lettered picks, sliding one out will result in one or two more coming out with it... and not just falling out. They will EJECT out. To make my situation a little more complicated, I use the new Petrucci Dunlop Jazz III picks, which not only are a little smaller than standard picks, but have a raised logo on them that "grabs" the pick beneath it as it slides out. The older Dunlop pickholders work much better than this one.  This pickholder is sleeker looking than the old ones, but it is about a quarter inch taller. I didn't mind that so much, because I could fit a couple more picks into it (five or six 1.5 mm picks).  But it's unusable for me with the picks I play with. I'm going to give them away. Thankfully, they were cheap.	-1
Works great unless it gets twisted at which point it will rub against your neck.	1
Works great with my Acoustic!	1
Bought one and loved it so much I bought another. Can go tits high or slung low, depending on your preference. Extremely durable and Dunlop quality. Definitely a strap you can count on.	1
Strong, durable, comfortable strap.	1
Great instrument cable! Great low price too!	1
Clear amazing cable VERY UNDERRATED incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall	1
Excellent product.	1
i used the cable to rig up my wah-wah to my amp for use with either of my elec guitars (fender strat and gibson gothic) and everything worked out as planned with my planet waves instrument cable.	1
If the profile of the 90 degree plug was a little lower I'd give it five stars. As it is, it gets four.  It's a solid cord that does it's job. I haven't run it though any high powered mixers and recording gear so I can't speak to how any of the total or high end signal loss is (yes, there really is a difference between those high end cables and the rest, even if most people can't hear it). but for just plug and play? Works great.	1
I think every guitarist is in search of the perfect cable. This one is pretty close. I much prefer molded plastic ends over metal screw on ends. Any sheath that has moving parts eventually seems to fall apart. Am I right? This planet wave cable eliminates those moving parts. I'll take this classic series cable over some of the more "high end" offerings from Planet Waves and other manufacturers. A lot of those more expensive cables have bells and whistles like gold metal connectors, etc., but most of that stuff still has TOO MANY MOVING PARTS that come apart! Simple is always best.  I like 10 ft cables between my guitar and my pedal board because I don't move around much, and it keeps the clutter to a minimum. I also like the one right angle on this cable as I tend to hook my cable through my guitar strap. With the right angle, you put less tension on the cable.  One last thing I love about these cables is that they are a bit thinner than some other instrument cables. They are much easier to wrap and don't get weird bends in them because of too much girth. The cable generally seems to be shielded well enough that there isn't any problem with a thinner cable.	1
Bought two of these. Both failed at pretty much the same time, within a year. Both used in controlled conditions, on dry rehearsal rooms and stored carefully, they both actually look almost new, but don't work anymore. Save your money and look for something else.	-1
Love the holder and the picks looke great and nice  and I don't have to look around for my picks when I'm ready to play my guitar	1
Good-sized holder. I placed it between the tuners & it fits like it was made for that spot which is out of the way most of the time. Just enough tension to hold the picks & not too strong to to make it hard for me to remove them. Highly recommended.	1
Yet another awesome low cost guitar accessories from Jim Dunlop put the picks where you need them literally anywhere you need them stick it to the ceiling  if you got to	1
I have one of these for every guitar I own.  They look good, work well, and aren't too expensive.  Nice way to display your guitars, and have them ready for use.	1
It works well for my steel string and my electric but the nut on my classical does not fit between the rubber-coated supports.  I must turn the guitar and lower it from above to rest the guitar in it.  Once done, all is well.	1
Great, great sound. Our praise/worship team is very happy!! The sound clean and crisp. Everyone can hear themselves. We bought two. I think we should have bought a third one. We got it for $250...not sure if anyone is selling it for cheaper. Now matter what, we are very satisfied.!!	1
Heavy duty but supple. Very attractive. Good buy.	1
Arrived as described and looks just as great	1
What's not to like?  A sturdy, durable, comfortable strap.	1
Buen producto	1
Really stiff but gets the job done	1
What can I say?  It's a cable.  It's cheap, and it works as advertised.  Much less expensive than what they try to force on you at the local music shops.  Gold tips, yeah, right!	1
I love the fit and the sound quality. It doesn't come loose or wiggle once in place. I'll get this one again!	1
Most of my instruments have the jack on the face, rather than the edge, and most of the cables I have are straight-straight, so the cable jutted out more than I wanted it to, which also adds a bit too much tug to the joint. The bent connector is the most obvious remedy. The cable is long enough for what I need it for, and it doesn't seem to add any noise at all to the signal. The rubber on the cable feels nice as well, and the cords have a good bend to them, and resist tangling more than some cables I've used. But I also don't spend a lot of time turning around in circles to encourage it to tangle. I'm really happy with this cable, and I'd probably buy another if I did something awful to this one.	1
Second one I bought. Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. Went through two of these before I learned my lesson. Don't waste your money on this junk. I love Planet Waves stuff normally, but these are junk.	-1
Other than it being unexpectedly long, it works perfectly and gives off a clear sound when connected to many different amps.	1
It's a utilitarian item.  Guitar cables aren't very sexy.  It seems to have decent shielding.  The strain relief is good.  The plugs are a precise fit for standard 1/4" jacks.	1
A simple affordable instrument cable. I prefer cable ends that are formed (not the type which can be unscrewed), as there is less risk of breakage and noise. Cable quality is not high (for professional recorded you'll something better), but very good in general.	1
Attach one of these to your guitar with the included adhesive strip, and you'll always have a spare pick at the ready.	1
A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it. At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there, but it's never bothered me one bit. Reaching for pics is never a problem. I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics. This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal.	1
Nice little product. The adhesive isn't great, but it reattaches when it comes off so far... keeping it until it doesn't work any longer	1
it holds about 6 to 7 picks.  pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate.  would recommend.	1
I always lose my damn picks, this helps. Hopefully I don't lose this pick holder that would really suck because there is like ten in there!	1
I saw a video of this capo in action and said... wow that looks easy! Well,  I can't quite slide it up on down my Takamine Santa Fe quite as easily as the video but it's pretty close. It might just take some practice. Quality is good. One drawback is that it is not wide enough for use on my 12 string guitar.	1
I've been playing guitar for 30+ years and have tried many capos. I used this for one day and it's been collecting dust since. Although the concept seemed nice to me, using it leaves a little to be desired.  When resting the capo on the nut of the guitar and sliding it down, more times than not it will pull a string or two out of tune.  Depending on neck thickness, in my opinion it applies too much pressure, again, causing strings to go out of tune. The overhang of the capo can get in the way at times, especially at your high e.  This of course depends on your playing style.  You might also consider the springs, roller contacts, they will wear in time.  If I were to recommend a capo, I would suggest the Shubb c-1, you can adjust the pressure to be "just enough" without taking your guitar out of tune.  It's compact, very easy to use and quick to install. A huge point, it does not get in the way.  Another good one, but expensive, is the G7. It is somewhat faster to adjust, much heavier and a higher price tag.	-1
great strap. looks good and is made to last.	1
Looking back on my long musical career, I have played many instruments, but I keep coming back to my first love... the cowbell.  Oh sure, I've tried them all - from triangle to wood block but I have never felt so in tune with any other instrument than the Cowbell.  I have many different cowbells in my collection.  Most of these are for a particular mood only. If I am feeling somewhat polka, I always reach for my signature "Shmenge Brothers #6" with the zebrawood handle... for rock it is my "Gussmann Blue-Steel Screamer"... jazz see's me grab my "Trini Lopez Limmited Addition Melody Master" knock-off.  But here is the finest single cowbell I have ever played.  It has such a full & pleasant sound it seems to go with any type of music I play.  My group was shocked when I showed up to our last gig and I only brought this little beauty with me.  They protested at first and even threatened not to do the show, but their fears quickly disovled when I brought the house down with our first song of the night.  I can only close with this... Buy this Cowbell and see if I am not right!  This thing is a Godsend for any serious cowbeller out there.  You will reach new areas of playing that you did not even think were possible.	1
After five months of light home use mine quit working.  It loses connection after being plugged into the guitar for a while.  Not worth ten cents.	-1
The jacks were bad from the minute I took them out of the box.  If you move the wrong way the sounds cracks and goes out.  Not a fan, but what should I have expected for a chord that was less than 10$	-1
Thin, slick, solid, what else do you want from a cable. Stop reading reviews and buy it, its pricier in stores. Unless you have a gig tomorrow of course...	1
It is really the best pick holder i ever had. I can put 6, 7 picks on it. It says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb, I recommend.	1
Great	1
Hi I need this item for travelling and it has work very well. I am pleased I have purchased this little yet great product.	1
This is one of the swag, crappy stocking stuff gifts that you get that seems like a good idea, but sucks in reality. Just get a small glass bowl to hold your picks, this thing is dumb.	-1
This works for holding your picks but if you're like me and you carelessly grab for picks then odds are you are going to break a couple of these as I did.	1
Really nice strap, Great construction, Plenty of girth like a belt ,Well worth the coin and Man it looks killer...	1
This is a really nice strap.  It's very thick and feels like it's well made and high quality for a non-bank breaking price on a strap.  Looks cool and vintage, I am a fan of many Dunlop products and this one does not disappoint at all.	1
Very Happy!!!	1
This will fit in the palm of you hand.  I should have looked at the diminsions.  5 inches.  It didn't work too well on a gig.  Got plenty of laughs though.	-1
Somewhat of a tenor tone.  Even though the size was listed, it was smaller than I envisioned.  This turned into an advantage as my kit configuration after some hardware updates/changes allowed it to fit in just right for mounting.	1
This is well made, easy to assemble and comes with drywall screw in mollys which makes it a Snap to install, very durable and will last for years, Highly recommend these over other brands!!	1
I purchased the Planet Waves 10 Ft Instrument cable for our son to hook up his electric guitar to his amplifier. It works well...no connectivity issues whatsoever. Highly recommend.	1
cable shorted out after 1 month of light use	-1
I'm glad I spent the few extra bucks to get a quality cable. I was very pleasantly surprised by the obvious quality of this cable as soon as I touched it. It has a supple, flexible rubbery quality, unlike my last cable, which was stiff and plasticky. No static whatsoever when I plugged it in -- absolutely clean. And the right angle plug is a huge asset when your guitar's jack is in an awkward place. Goodbye, crackly plasticky old cable!	1
Have only been using this, Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable (10ft), for a month, or so.  It seems to be made very well, but time will tell.  The connection to my guitar and amp appears to be solid, and I'm satisfied.  I will report back if, and when, there is anything of notice.	1
I bought this cable to connect a Burns B-3 Theremin to an amp, and it has worked admirably in that application. I have NOT used it to plug an electric guitar into an amp, and I cannot speak to what kind of a job it would do in that situation. The jacks seem well made, and the cable itself is plenty heavy. Were I using this for a guitar, I would make certain I put some slack in the cable and then pinned the cable to the guitar with the guitar strap, taking all strain off the jack.  This is important for expensive cables, and I would think it critical for one of these less expensive models.  (They have to cut corners somewhere to deliver a cable at this price, and first on my list of suspected places would be where the cable connects to the jack. But so fay (5 months out), everything is working fine.	1
The Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable, 5 feet is a very well pro made cable that has always been exactly what I needed.	1
I've learned the hard way so many times that you get what you pay for. These cables are well worth the purchase. Planet Waves honestly never disappoints, and I can tell these are made to last (as long as you don't abuse them/wrap them correctly.	1
The cables work well and I like the rubber on the ends instead of metal because of the whammy bar on some of my guitars.	1
This pick holder is pretty awesome. It's nice to have a place for picks on the guitar. If you're anything like me I always keep a pick in the strings up by the neck of the guitar. NOT ANYMORE! They now sit in this beautiful little pick holder attached to my guitar!!!	1
I love this little item.  I was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new Fender but I love it.  No more hunting for picks anymore.  When I am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and it's always there when I pick up the guitar. Placement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar.  I placed mine where I'd never rub against it, between the amp cord inlet and a control knob.  Make sure it isn't in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it. I love this and have one coming for my acoustic too, only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar. Oh, I use medium picks and fit 7 easily into the holder and wouldn't try to squeeze another on in, but that's why you have a gig bag anyway.  This is a must have item, in my opinion.	1
I got this as a stocking stuffer for my musician husband, and he thought it was a pretty nifty idea.  Now when he plays shows or is practicing and drops a pic, he doesnt need to fiddle around to find another one.  He stuck it right to his strap.	1
This is the kind of guitar strap you are going to have for the rest of your life extremely  thick and durable made of awesome material... buy it	1
Looks good with my Carmel Gibson Les Paul.  Leather ends are stiff and I have no concerns with the guitar falling out.  Pretty cheap too.	1
This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first, it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)	1
This is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double-leather ends.  The color stands out well on the black background.  Available in various colors.	1
I wasn't expecting much from this due to the cost,but I wanted to really like it because the design is great. I put it on my LP Gothic and it's just...stiff. I have adjusted it, and the crease from where it was when it was sent has stayed. I primarily play in a seated position, and it can get in my way. Hopefully it will break in with time.	-1
The fabric is thick and appears to be durable.  the strap ends are thick enough for confident retention but not so thick that they don't fit on older plastic pegs like those in my gibson acoustic.  I would... and probably will... buy another one of these to replace some of my less comfortable straps.  There may be better straps out there but not for this price.  $10	1
The sound is great but it wasn't as large as I thought it would be. It will work for what I need it for. If you buy this, make sure first to look at the specifics of the product that it is the size you want.	1
These cables are just what I hoped they would be. They work well on my electric and my acoustic. Happy guy here Thanks	1
I've purchased many of these cables and I'll be getting more eventually. Cables, even good ones, eventually break. These are quite flexible, seem durable, and are by a brand name. If you need cables, these work great.	1
They are reasonably priced and do the job. I recommend them as a good all purpose cord. Will be buying more.	1
When I buy a new instrument, I come to amazon and get this cable, a strap, and a set of strap locks. For the price you can't beat this thing. And it's 20ft long. It's a good quality cable and the right angle end is a must for me. Every one of these cables I've received has been great quality and has a long life a head of it.	1
These are great and very useful. Described accurately in the description of the product. I intend to purchase more of these in the future.	1
I am a gtr player with more than 20 years of experience. I tried for a long time Finger-ease, Dunlop 65, Fast Fret, and Planet Waves String Cleaner. These are all good products, however Finger-ease does a better job. It really lasts longer protecting and lubricating your strings, takes care of your callouses and smells good!	1
I tried this several times on all of my guitars and it just made no difference at all in the noise. Try something else.	-1
This is exactly what I expected when I ordered it.  This will be very useful with our guitars. Thank you.	1
It holds picks. It's plastic. It works. It holds picks that say Dunlop, the Beatles, Fender, etc. i HATE WRITING SO MANY WORDS TO DESC RIBE THIS STUPID THING. bUY ONE. yOU'LL LIKE IT. Sorry, cap lock.	1
Genius concept. It works for me perfectly. I no longer lose or misplace my picks. Easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in. It'll depend on  where you decide to place this Pickholder, I placed mine right above the jack plug	1
Need moar cowbell? This gives you moar cowbell. Don't need moar cowbell? I'd maybe skip this.	1
Good quality cowbell for the money. I'm very satisfied.	1
I love dunlop straps because I'm a tall guy and they're long enough for me not to look like an electric-guitar-playing-mariachi.	1
I love this strap so far!  I really like the leather tips, and the feel of the strap. I don't really like the stiffness of the strap, but I'll learn to deal with it. It's a really solid strap. If your looking for a strap that is solid quality for a more affordable price, than this is for you.	1
I bought two of these straps from a local store for thirty bucks each about two years ago. They've been the best straps; along with the same straps without the grommets, that I've used. I figured I'd save a bit and get a couple more from Amazon. I got them fast and saved twenty bucks. They do fine with my fairly heavy Fender and St Blues guitars as well as my P bass. They are middle of the road for price and width, but give me no comfort issues at all. My second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets. Super tight and easy to lower. Raising it is a different story though. I just save the fast "lower played" songs for last. Those are the best ones anyway. Excellent strap.	1
The sound is OK, it varies according to the way it is held. The size is listed and I should have visualized it better, actually wanted a bigger one.	1
The spring is strong enough to keep the picks in place, but soft enough to release them when you need one.  The adhesive is sticky as you would expect.  It works.	1
Great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks. It does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice. It does not take up much room & it sure feels good to have extra picks close by so that you do not have to scramble to find another one.	1
Very good sound and quality.  I am not a professional guitarist, so these cables will do just fine for me.	1
It does what I need to get my bass and guitar to the amp. Probablly not much use being only five feet in length for a gig or show but since I am only rocking out in my house it's no big deal.	1
The cable is great. The thing I like most about it is it's softness - it's much softer and much more flexible than any other cable I've used. Did not notice any problems with the signal, so it does its job well enough.	1
It's a bit thinner than the average cable. Not as thick as I would like but works well and its kind of nice and slick to put away. Very smooth.	1
I got this cowbell to let a 'lucky audience' member play when our band is playing that song that makes everyone want more cowbell.  This cowbell has a nice full sound, great tone and is a must for any band that is looking for some audience participation.	1
It feels very durable, it has the perfect design and holds my guitar very tight without damaging it... It's simple, hardcore looking, cheap, heavy duty materials, I recommend it for sure !!!	1
Nice strap. Sturdy nylon. The grommets give this strap a punk look, I just started playing and still working on a "look". Leather, punk almost sleazy. But thus strap is no rag.	1
I've been using this for years. Never fails. Keeps your hand sliding through the neck like it was bathed in butter.	1
Been using this for years.  Makes strings last longer keeps them clean and smooth.	1
I like this better than FastFret... maybe because I'm lazy and its easier to spray on then wipe off, than to rub FastFret against the strings up and down along all strings, then wipe off.  It also conditions my fretboard.	1
I got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world.... after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead,,,	-1
I wanted something inexpensive and well made and decided to go with Planet Waves over the similarly priced Fender cable. I like it because the tip is one piece instead of screw on and the price was just right. When I have to replace this cable I will likely buy this same cable or something else by PW because of all the cables I have owned PW seems to withstand my abuse most effectively.	1
Dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly. Will never buy again even if only 5 bucks	-1
Planet Wave's cables have never let me down before. Great stuff that I can count on. Never leave without having at least one somewhere in my signal chain.	1
Good  cable works for me, using it in a rhythmtrak foot switch. Just the right length. May order more as extra's.	1
WOW,if you need a guitar cable this is it...it's metal on the tips and long and black in the body (like a long snake with shiny ends) no, it works just fine and just long enough for my playing...if you have a guitar and amp you will need this...even without a guitar and an amp it's still fun to have!!!<<< be warned this review may not help you...so go on to the next, if you need too>>>	1
For 6 and 12 string acoustic guitars this capo is A1. If you put it past the nut then tune the guitar in that position you will have no problems rolling it up the neck without tuning problems. Of course, if you have a cheap guitar with poor intonation the tuning will go out but that's not down to the capo. This capo WILL work with electric and classical guitars. The capo is wide enough even for these guitars.  However, this is where the problems come and why I have given the capo 4 stars. As this capo has a fixed tension it bends the thinner strings of a standard electric guitar and a nylon strung classical guitar causing multiple tuning problems. This could probably be mitigated by overstretching the springs so that the tension wasn't as hard. It could also be solved by the manufacturer putting some kind of spring tension adjustment screw somewhere.	1
Nice capo, easy to use, and seems to work pretty well. Much easier to use than trying to move a conventional capo mid-song!	1
The best capo ever, IMO. Bought one when it first came out, so I've had it a long time (20+ yrs, I reckon). Built to last forever. Great on both acoustic and electric. Perfect for praise and worship music. Stays in tune!	1
My husband thinks this is the best lubricant for his guitar. He highly recommends it and he's been playing for over 50 years.	1
I bought one to use especially for my 12 strings. I have this on all 18 of my guitars, both acoustic & electric. Does everything it says it does. Playing was always satisfying, but now, no pain! Bending & sliding is a breeze. Bought 2 more cans so I don't run out	1
Love this stuff. I use it to clean the strings on my electric. Makes them nice and slick.	1
good stuff	1
We have used this product for years, we have been very happy with its use, many, many years ago my guitar instructor recommended it, we also recommend it,	1
This pick holder functions fine, but it has too small of an outline for most of my picks. It's ok, but it only holds smaller size picks.	-1
It only holds 5 heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok.  The tapered design might be to make picks eject easier?  I never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to.  Except.  I did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars.  These are good don't get me wrong.	1
It's just unbelievable how well this device holds picks.  I mean, you just insert your guitar picks in this device and BAM - it holds them!  No further action is necessary! And when you need a pick - you just pull one out, and there it is! What will they think of next?	1
Every once in awhile, while browsing through Amazon, I come across something I don't know how I got along without!! And it really works!	1
I can't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use. I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own. And every student I've ever had, has one on their guitar as well. They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding. They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time, they can be easily removed and relocated. After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location. I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others. No matter how many picks you store, or for how long, the spring action loader never loses its resistance. I highly recommend these. I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product. If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks, this is the product for you.	1
They only hold a few of the heavier gauge picks, but they work. The only issue is they're only available as an add on feature. But that's a pretty stupid idea from Amazon.	1
It makes me look like a hardass, even thought I'm not.  Not at all.  It's cheaper than a bullet strap too.	1
I enjoy this strap very much, although it is very heavy material and needs good breaking in before it feels good. but for price its well worth it.	1
this guitars strap can work in any guitar, from a really light  guitar as a bird of prey to a  heavy Warlock NT	1
For anyone who might not know, Planet Waves is the non-String division of D'Addario. They make excellent quality everything (even though I'm a GHS string user for life endorsement). I love their auto trim tuners, and all their cables, including their very nice cable ties that simply clip onto any standard size cable and wraps with an elastic tie around and clips to itself. Easy to remove by just a twist if the cable goes bad and you want the tie for a new cable.	1
Excellent cable, light, appears to resist kinking. The right angle plug is good for my Jazz bass, which has a top-mounted jack. Good quality cable overall.	1
No problems at all with this product.  Works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from Amazon.  I would recommend this product.	1
Always high quality for a reasonable price. More durable than the cheap cables you find online and less expensive than the 'boutique' cables.. Great working-man's gear. Not so cheap that you can't rely on them, not so expensive that you can't buy a number of extras.	1
This was bought based on the advice of others. I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.  It worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. It happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. After confirming the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.  D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. In my case, I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.  Again, this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good. The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. I don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. Well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.  So the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. I figure I'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, I may get it replaced. More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.  If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, I'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. IDK how much R&D it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. That would NOT make it a deal breaker.	-1
Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord. Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord.	-1
I plugged in the amp, and I plugged in the bass, and there were no issues with the wire.  This is one of those products you don't want to overly notice, and in that it has done the job is is designed for.	1
This Greg Bennett Glider Rolling Capo works great and does ALL it says it will.  True sound and doesn't put your guitar out of tune.  This seller is great also.  Make sure you only buy a Greg Bennett one and not an imitation that has inferior materials.	1
Not recommended if you plan to use it over the nut (as I do) It knocks the tuning out too much for me to use with my students.	-1
It delivers on all but one of its promises. I would not roll it over the nut and leave it there to "store". I found that message conflicting as even the instructions say you shouldn't leave it on an instrument when not playing. You do need to take it on and off carefully because it's on these really tight springs and has some sharp edges that could possibly scratch wood. I took off one star for that. In every other way, it's awesome.	1
I purchased this pickholder for my son who has a nasty habit of leaving things in places they don't belong.  The holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find.  Best purchase I have made.	1
I mounted this on my acoustic guitar and it makes pick storage and replenishment so much easier! A must have for guitarists.	1
This is a great pick holder. I think I'm going to attach some velcro to the back to get it to stay on my strap, since the adhesive does not adhere well to a cloth strap.	1
I store my picks in there and I put it by my table. It's a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done.	1
Used this for years.  Works like it is supposed to.	1
Good product, good price.	1
i love this stuff. Strings feel softer and smell sweet.	1
Live and die by this stuff.	1
This is the best, just get it and see for yourself.	1
I used this string lube in my R&R days back in the mid sixties. I rediscovered it a few months ago. It's every bit as good as it was all those years ago but with the new coated strings I only need to spray a little on a microfiber cloth and wipe the strings down after each session.	1
NOTE: I did not purchase through this seller, but at a local store. Review is for product only.  I have been using this stuff for well over a decade. I love the way it makes the strings feel, and I hate playing without it. I also use it to polish the back of the neck of my satin finish guitars. It makes the neck and strings feel soft and smooth.  The oils in my hand also prove to be much more corrosive than most poeples, to the point that (without any products) I would have to change my strings at least once a week or else they are completely dead sounding. Finger ease helps solve this problem. I use finger ease every few days (I play a few hours a day) before I play, and I use GHS Fast Fret after every session before I put the guitar up. I personally, do not like the feel of Fast Fret vs Finger ease, so I tend to give the strings a good wipe before I start to play then reapply when I am done. If need be, I'll do a little quick spray of Finger Ease before playing (especially before a gig!).  This method of treating the strings not only keeps the guitar playing super smooth and fast, but it has extended the life of my strings at least 4 fold (I only have to change my strings every 1-2 months vs every week). Make sure you wipe the bottom of the strings as well by inserting a microfiber cloth between the strings and fret board.	1
This is a heavy duty strap. I use these on my fender guitars to make sure my guitar doesn't fall. It is a very comfy strap and prolly wouldn't break if you had a knife to it. It's the best strap money can buy.	1
It's not the most comfortable strap, but not UN-comfortable, either.  It seems secure.  And most important for me, the strap is longer than most, which was good for my SG where the strap button is all the way down near the neck joint.	1
very nice strap i love it would buy more if needed seem's strong hold's up well not much more i can say	1
I have two of these.  They hold a variety of guitars just fine.  Since the blocks are square, make sure you get them aligned with a wall or ceiling so they don't look crooked.  They seem to come from a variety of wood - mine are not a matched set even though I ordered two of the same part.  They have different wood grains.	1
The best for mounting your favorite axes! Mounting them is highly recommended but hump them at your own peril. I like being surrounded by hanging guitars since it makes them easily available to grab and play, as they deserve to be. These Wall Hangers are easily installed and inexpensive too! Get a bunch and proudly display your entire guitar family!	1
Guess anyone can get a bad cable. Just bought this and never got to use it cause anytime you moved it it lost connection. Looked like the molded ends would be good in the long run. I bought a 20' GLS audio cable that is working fine right now. My friend calls them Iron cables cause that's what they look like. It had the fabric like the old electric irons had back in the day. This cable feels cheap when you hold it. The diameter of the cable is rather small compared to some. Anyway I sent this one back in exchange for another one. Guess that will take about a month to get another bad one. 2nd one!!!! I sent the first one back cause it didn't work. Now the replacement one has stopped working. If you play for a living or in front of people you might want to buy a better cable. This one is sure to ruin your night if you don't have backup.	-1
You can't go wrong with Planet waves products they are well made at a decent price. The cable I purchased I think will serve me well for a long time.	1
I have be a musician for over 30 years... and thru that time i have purchsed ben guitar cables... Planet Waves Cables  are the best i have used ... and also the best product for the price Don't be fooled by others making claims about this or that.. about thier products You find nothing but quality from Planet waves.... Simply catch  "the Wave"  and your Music will flow effortlessly  .	1
Don't let the term "nylon" fool you. This is a really nice, thick strap. Nothing like those $5 cheap straps. A great value and it matches my guitar that has a cool retro 50's pinstripe flame paintjob.	1
Amazons desperate begging for reviews is sad to say the least. the products are good,generally what they say they are.	1
I seriously do is so small and cute and it goes on the back of my guitar and I have great access to it. Fantastic.	1
Had no issues in the 2 months. There is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your 'real' picks, which helps with its looks.	1
It's actually sleek looking and although I didn't have the nerve to actually stick this to my guitar, it's a lot easier to find this in my guitar bag or even in my room than a few stray picks here and there. It holds about 8 medium size picks for me and I'm sure I'll lose a lot less picks because of it! It's almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing..is that weird to say? Just buy it already!	1
Perfect size and does it's job. had one pick inside as a place holder. Stick tape holds it anywhere you want it. Cheap and easy.	1
Have yet to have a clear opinion of this capo. It fits well and very tight. It moves easy enough . It is very easy to install/uninstall.  The very tight fit on the neck. Have not had it long enough to see how it will last and whether or not it affects the tuning, ( so far it has not )  It's just something one has to get use to and time will tell.	1
Great concept from quick key changes.	1
It's a good product that does everything it is supposed to do. I am very happy with my purchase. However, it is a little small and would probably not fair well on an instrument with a really wide neck. I enjoy being able to glide the capo with ease, but taking it on and off is not as easy as other capos specifically because this capo clips over and around the entire neck. It is still a good product for the price.	1
Feels great on your fingers, the only downside is the residue left behind which doesn't come off regardless of whether you wipe it off or not. I would recommend applying it after you finish playing guitar, slightly wiping it, and leaving your guitar to dry.	1
Works better than described! Friction and drag are greatly reduced.	1
Great lubricant.  Hasn't gum up the guitar yet.  Also try just baby powder for your hand so that it slides easier on the back side of the neck.	1
Makes old strings sound new for a couple days, lasts a long time, I've had one can for over a hear	1
I use this on a regular bases. I find that it really helps in keeping strings in great shape for along time.  This is a must have for someone with a guitar collection and does not want to change strings all the time.	1
I almost can't play without a can handy. It's been safe for my guitar finishes and feels like silicone spray without the overbearing slippery feeling. My only critique, It may slightly dry out the rosewood fret board but, I change my strings and oil the FB often so it's of no real consequence. The product benefits outweigh the little added maintenance. I'm a casual at home player and one quick spray will last a few sessions. I spray and use pretty much right away to distribute along strings and neck. I believe the directions call to spray and dry before use which may give the spray a longer usable feel. If you have sweaty hands, spray on.	1
cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use. Still highly recommended for the money,	1
I use these cables with my POD HD 500 as direct out to my PA at home.  Didn't like the rolled up look of the stage cables.  Sounds good and out of the way.	1
These are as good as Monster (and cheaper) and better than Guitar Center's house brand. Lifetime unconditional warranty speaks for itself.	1
good brand name, its just a softer (and therefore weaker) rubber that i'd like to see. but for under fifteen bucks, this is perfect. i think i could scour the internet for days and still not find a cable this long with a right angle plug that is less than this.	1
The ends on this are molded, so there will be no repairing of them, but they also hopefully won't break.  I'm a recreational bass player, so I can't speak to its road worthiness, but I'm very satisfied.	1
I use this to kind of organize my picks. I typically have them laying around everywhere; coffee table, dinner table, desk, etc. I just have two of these floating around and that is how I access my picks. I have not attached them to anything	1
There is not much to say about this product except for it does what its intended to do which is hold picks. I use medium and heavy picks, so I think I fit about ten inside. Also comes with a sticker on the bottom so it could be stuck to your guitar, amp or whatever	1
it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks. It does exactly what it says it does. its also very cheap.	1
I have mi picks available and all in the same place with this pickholder. You can stick it to the guitar. Is light and cheap.  Go for it.	1
you can stick this in your gig bag, in your pocket or with the stick on back, always have extra picks with you. Great Idea.	1
as I said on my last Dunlop strap review I love the Dunlop Guitar straps not expensive strong and sturdy just a great product I have 4 or 5 of them. when I buy a guitar I buy a Dunlop strap and Strap locks always to protect my investment.	1
I love the  Dunlop Guitar straps not expensive strong and sturdy just a great product I have 4 or 5 of them. when I buy a guitar I buy a Dunlop strap and Strap locks always to protect my investment.	1
A very nice strap and well made. It is hard to put on at first, but better than slipping off.	1
Keeps the strings slick	1
This stuff works pretty well.  It helps my 63 year-old fingers to slide more easily on those nasty, round wound guitar strings  LOL.  When you get older, every little bit helps!	1
I am a 20 year pro player, and this is my favorite string/neck conditioner product. It dries quickly, cleans and lubes the strings well, and doesn't impact the tone at all, if anything it improves it by knocking down finger noise a little yet maintaining the high frequencies. Fast Fret is too greasy and noticeably deadens tone, Dunlop 65 is good stuff but the applicator shreds before the product is all used up and it's not good on the back of the neck. It also smells awesome.  I do not use this or any conditioner every day, but when I'm playing outdoor gigs in San Diego, in the evening the humidity changes and I get this strange stickiness on my fingers than makes it hard to play. This stuff knocks that right out. It's also great on the back of the neck, and I've never had any damage on instruments from cheap to very valuable vintage.	1
I bought this for my boyfriend who swears by it! He would buy it by the case if I let him. We reordered this product so that he would have extra on hand. Great product!	1
Went up easy - just scan for studs. I put up three - two guitars and a bass, and they work perfectly. The rubber on the forks is gentl on the finish. The forks extend out from the wall so even a fat acoustic does not touch the wall. Well done.	1
Great sound quality, meets full expectations. Cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality. It's worth spending a few extra dollars on a good quality cable rather than to buy other crappy cables.	1
Once I switched to these cables I never use anything else now. Great connection sounds good and no issues at all.	1
havent used this one yet.  i got it to run to my pedal board for those stages where the backline is not easily accessible.  seems like a well made cable and i like planet waves products in general	1
I own many guitar cables: monster and planet waves.  This one is the easiest to wrap at the end of a playing session.	1
Solid, reliable and rocks. Works as expected and should last a really really long time. Glad I bought it. Nothing else to say. Thanks.	1
Use this 10 footer from my effects components into an amp or p.a. setup. Thinner and more light weight than I expected, but sounds as good as any cable I've used. I like the right angle plug. It doesn't bend the cable at the connection so that should extend the life of the cable. Great price and quick ship. I also have the 20 footer to run from my guitar to my effects. My guitar's output comes straight out on the front, so the right angle again doesn't bend the cable and has a better feel when moving around with the guitar.	1
I've used several different kinds of guitar cables, and I've finally settled on planet waves cables. From patch cables to guitar cables, I simply trust this company. In most cases the difference between guitar cables is the same difference between an iPhone and an Android, there really isn't one - it simply comes down to user prefrence. So in that regard, I prefer planet waves cables. I snagged this cable so I had the one right angle for my pedal board and the other end for my guitar. Highly recommended!	1
I replaced my old cable and I got a pleasant surprise when I received this one.  It is much more flexible than other cables I have used.  The length is perfect for practice and exhibits very good sound pick up and delivery to my amp.	1
My son loves being able to keep his picks all together and not in the baby food jar as we once had them lol.	1
I dunno I thought I needed a pick holder, already had one but had forgotten. Not sure where I put it now, but it I am sure one day I will use it and just LOVE it for it's ergonomic beauty and vast utilitarian properties. It's greatest purpose thus far has been qualifying for Super Savings so that a $23 item could ship free as well.	1
Like all of Dunlop products, this worked great.  It's real convenient on those rare occasions when you drop a pick in the middle of a performance.  I'm a Dunlop fan.	1
Strings stay bright sounding a lot longer, great for cleaning strings, Helps with chord/ position changes, less squeak, Been using this product for years	1
helps the fingers alot	1
love this stuff, works great and easy to use.	1
Recommend it to any musician to clean your strings.	1
Very stiff and unflexible.  I bought it for the celtic knot design.  I'm replacing it because the stiffness is just too much.	-1
I play in a church band with a keyboardist who does numerous key changes.  This capo  is well worth the money if you need to change keys quickly in the middle of a song, as I do quite frequently.	1
I use capos extensively (on nearly all of my songs, and about half the covers I know) so it's critical for me to have a capo that doesn't tweak the tuning on my guitar too badly. Kyser and other spring-type capos affect my tuning too much to use outside of practicing at home, and even my Shubb (which is pretty great) requires retuning after I place it. So I finally got creative and checked this rolling capo out.  Of everything I've used, this seems to affect the guitar's tuning the least. If I capo pretty high (4th fret or above) it seems to move just a hair off, but it's something you'd need a precision tuner to even notice, and on the first few frets where I normally stay, it is nearly dead-on. It's also handy when I have two songs back-to-back that need a capo, to just slide it over to the next spot instead of removing and reapplying.  The only negative thing I can think of is that I wouldn't really recommend sliding it over the nut to play non-capoed songs... you can, but the act of rolling it all the way off the neck does usually put some strings out of tune for me. I just pop it off the guitar for those songs and put it back later, no big deal. Also, you'd have to be crazy (or just way smoother than me) to try and change it mid-song... I have to use both hands to roll it to a new position so I'd have to stop playing for a couple bars to manage that. But that's a situation I almost never run into.  To be fair, I have not tried the fabled G7th capo yet, but of the four or five varieties I have used, this one applies the most even pressure and changes the guitar's tuning the least. I use it at gigs every week as my main capo.	1
I've purchased six of these and they are great. Easy install. Instead of the supplied screws, I use 2" sheet-rock screws. Use drill with philips head screw bit and they're installed in a minute or two. You MUST hit a wall stud with the screws. I would never trust wall anchors or molly's to hold my guitar collection securely. Depending on the headstock of your guitar (especially for Telecasters)  you can bend or squeeze the the hanging forks closer together making sure your guitar is secure. You can also tilt/twist the hanger a little (one way or the other) so your guitar will hang straight up and down. I have before purchased a couple cheaper type guitar hangers (plastic) to save a couple bucks and wish I hadn't. Go with these you'll be pleased.	1
I wrote I like it as opposed to love it because they do make a few that are even better.  However that does not minimize the effectiveness of this device.  There are no flaws.  Those that are a little more costly are not better they just offer other features:  front strap, bendable hooks, nicer wood, things like that.  But if you want just the basic that is every bit as good as all the others then this is the one you want.  Holds well, easy to install even on drywall without a stud to secure the mounting.  Come with counter sinks.  Also once you screw on the hooks to the beautiful wood finished post it does not move.  It is solid, it will not swivel!!  Unless you want some special feature this is the best on the market.  I have a recording studio and this is the best way to hang guitars in the studio area.  Of course multi guitar racks are needed for general storage, Amazon has those as well.	1
First of all I liked the fact that it came coiled in a circular coil instead of the bow tie pattern that leaves bends through out the lenght of the cord.  The jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief. It sounds ok for the price.	1
This same chord was almost 30 bucks in a regular store it just had a different name on it, sounds great and you won't trip all over the place while rocking out, so get one today.	1
What can one say about a cable? They are intended to transmit electrical impulse with the least amount in interference and this one does a superb job of just that. Why I have been thinking of replacing all of my other cables with additional cables just like this one, only slightly longer or a good deal shorter depending on the intended function.	1
Very handy to have.  Could peel paper off bottom and stick to guitar (or something) to keep your picks close at hand.  I haven't done that myself as I don't want to mess up the finish of my guitar but could see it being handy. Picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed.	1
it didn't hold as many i as thought(it only holds 8)but that didn't matter,now i finaly have some where to put my picks so i don't lose them.the pick holder also has a sticky thing at the bottom so you can stick it to your guitar or somthing.	1
I like it so much that I ordered a second one. For years, I have been using the Shubb capos and I am very happy with Shubb products (and service). I find that the Glider is very handy It stays attached to the guitar so it doesnt get set down or misplaced. I find it easier to stay in tune with the Glider after repeated "capo ing" Ken [...]	1
If you like nice, slippery strings and like keeping them on your instrument longer (i.e. not changing your strings every month) then this product is for you!	1
Exactly what my hubby wanted!	1
Nothin' better.	1
When I am playing my guitar I sometimes feel that the neck gets a little sticky and I thought I'd give this a try. The Fingerease helps both playing on the fretboard and moving up and down the neck.	1
Been using it for years. Will keep using it for years.  Makes life easy on old fingertips and, along with a good wipe down after picking, extends the life of strings IMHO.	1
It's mostly an at home practice cable, so can't say how much road abuse it can take.  But fine for my purposes.	1
Great cable! very robust 1/4in jack that so far has been great! I highly recommend for the price. Rock on!	1
Great cable. I've played many gigs with it. It's pretty strong, the sound comes very clean. I would recommend it to anyone	1
This works well, and the spray is handy, but also a bit messy.  I have gone back to fast fret.	1
love this product will buy more.	1
I have been a FingerEase fan for 15 plus years. I hate to forget it or run out, keeps the neck nice and fast even on guitars with glossy necks (Les Pauls, PRS). String noise is reduced but the main benefit is the ease of playing you get when the strings are slick. String noise is reduced but the main benefit of FingerEase is keeping them clean and fast. Worlds better than Fast Fret, try Fast Fret instead...	1
great stuff	1
I bought this item as a stocking stuffer for the husband.  He typically keeps a pickholder on his pedal boards instead of having them all over or on the mic stand.  It works as expected.  I believe he put about 6-8 picks in there.	1
Good quality. It was a great price for it. A + + + + + + + + + +	1
This pick holder works for me. It holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed. It fits my Jasmine well. Buy it from GO-DPS since they have one of the best customer service and quality products!	1
Simple, but elegant in size for placement in a guitar case. This a great device to put my genuine 'Planet Waves' signature picks in. Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus'	1
what can I say,.. it's a guitar cable.  I can turn my amp up to 11 and have all the signal from guitar to amp I need. sometimes I have pedals in between to help hide me nasty strumming. 1984 strat standard, in some awful yellow colour.  I call her Blondie!	1
I bought these for spares and also use on other amps so not to have to swap back and forth. I like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std. Telecaster input jack great. The flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked. These do not tangle in use and roll up easily for storage. I have more expensive cables but rather use these.	1
Not much too it.  I like it better than throwing them in an Altoid can cause its easier to grab one from this spring loaded holder.	1
I applied this to numerous guitars and was very useful for the money. Never left a mark on the intruments when removed.	1
Purchased this on a whim as Amazon suggested it during checkout.  So the purchase wasn't to satisfy a real need of any sort - however it is useful.  No real desire to put double sided tape on any of my instruments and as a home player, no need to.  So instead it went on the underside of a music stand, where it is out of the way and still very convenient.	1
Like these things. Got this for a third guitar. I don't drop my picks, but is a handy place to store them.	1
Man, this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks! DO NOT BUY - it is a wast of money... ug!	-1
I have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body.  People watching me can't really see it, and it's right where I need it, full of picks, if I drop one.  Wonderful little invention.  Buy it, if you don't want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket.	1
does what it says but i like the dunlop string cleaner and conditioner better	1
Been using this stuff for years! Still does the job. Keeps your guitar fretboard clean and lubricated, makes the guitar play easier!	1
love this product	1
Smooth!!!!	1
GOOD SIZED CAN . SEEMS TO SMOOTH OUT THESE NEW  MATIN "SP' LIGHTS .	1
great	1
Been using this stuff as long as I can remember.	1
Seem to help	1
I love this stuff. If you slide into notes or chords on your guitar Finger Ease makes it smooth and effortless. One spray over the fretboard before a performance and I'm good for an hour. I haven't changed strings for quite some time so there must be a lube quality to it as well. A must for the electric guitar and very helpful on acoustic guitars too.	1
I've used this product for 30 years - a little greasy and very cold weather limits its effectiveness somewhat (purchased it years ago to play street dances in the fall and my fingers were sticking due to the dry air).  Otherwise helps reduce hand/string noise and does improve playability if it's not too cold.	1
I used these on phos. bronze acoustic strings and there was no difference that I or my listeners could tell. Maybe they work for different types of strings, but not for mine so for me this was a waste.	-1
Mist have for all guitarplayers	1
Husband loves it... worth great	1
Best inexpensive right angle cables out there. I use these in my lesson room at the music store that I teach at. They will last forever if you take care of them.	1
These cables lay flat and don't cause a tripping hazard like the Monster cables I have, I am very pleased	1
AWESOME.. enough said. This item rocks thus far, been using for over 2 months. Hardly any sound through the wire. No drop noise through it. Small buzz, but amp turned up. WORKS like a charm. Best investment on a good cable.	1
Re-ordered these recently.  They hold up better than the cheaper brands.  No failures yet.  No interference from computers and other equipment.  Good guitar cables for the price.	1
I've used so many guitar cables over the years that I lost count. It's hard to find a tough, low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere, but this one is the best one out there for the price paid. Its made well, with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that I love. I use it for all of my equipment connections, and it simply works with no problems and no noise that I could detect. Try it out, you'll discover the same as me and my band mate's have, that this is the best cable for the money on Amazon!	1
It's good, but I think it's a little on the weak side construction wise. It just doesn't feel like it will hold up very long if I start jumping around on stage.	1
This cable is dirt cheap, but the quality seems to be just fine.  I am using it for my primary rig setup and I can't tell the different between this and some other cables.  Recommended.	1
I was very pleased with the item as it arrived on time and was exactly what I was expecting for what I had ordered!!!!!	1
Arrived on time and exactly as described.	1
Good. It works!	1
I am very satisfied for what this thing can do so much. My son has just started to learn playing the guitar and i am happy that thing thing can make it all easier for  him. Great product.	1
Perfect addition to the apartment to showcase some of my guitars. The wood color is great and it definitely adds to the wall even without a guitar in the sling. Might want to look into buying a few extra wall anchors just in case, some metal ones since these in particular snapped in half on one of the hangers when I was trying to put it in. Oh well, cheap wall anchors but they do the trick if they work.	1
Stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time. These hangers are easy to install, just find a stud behind the sheetrock or any wood to install it on and you are in business. The stringed instrument becomes  easily accessible and safe.	1
If you're looking for the highest quality cable, this isn't it.  If you want a good quality cable at a great price, you found it.	1
As all planet waves products this one is very resistant and useful cord, lightly with 20 feets, very long... its great	1
It is cheap and it does what it is supposed to do. Nothing more, nothing less. Unless you find yourself wanting to play jump rope with it, because you could.	1
works good	1
need it for acoustic for better slidings	1
Very helpful to keep your strings clean and responsive. The strings stay smooth without residue buildup preserving their tone and life. An added benefit is that the lubricant keeps your finger callouses softer.	1
It's not "Squeek-begone" exactly - more like "Squeek-be-quiet". And apparently it "conditions" your strings, whatever that means (and you couldn't accomplish with a light wipe of WD40). Nevertheless, it does help remove any residual gunk and oxidation buildup, so that's a plus worthy of throwing in the guitar coffin.	1
This is without a doubt one of the best things you can use to give a smoother playing experience to your fingers.  It lubricates both the strings and the fingerboard and lasts for a long time between applications.  Zero impact on the tone but makes your fingers glide over the strings much more easily, which helps your technique and eliminates a lot of "string squeak" in the process.  Wonderful stuff, I literally can't think of playing without it.  5 stars and highly recommended.	1
Bought this for a friend and he loves it. This item is good to have if you are a guiter player.	1
Nothing too crazy here. It holds your picks and sticks to your guitar. So far so good. Feels pretty durable, I'm sure it will last quite a while.	1
This design is a big improvement over string swings' past designs head stock fits snugly in the well made cradle.  quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch.  I will buy more if I get another guitar.	1
I had to buy this not to display my guitar, but to have it out of my 1-year-old's reach. And... it is just perfect! It seems durable, sturdy and nice. I would definitely recommend this product. I haven't tried the more expensive products, but this surely does the job for my acoustic guitar!	1
Works perfectly, pleasant smell. 4 stars for being a spray ... it's about odds even with Fast Fret, fast fret gets dirty but the spray thingy is less convenient to apply.  I prefer fast fret on electric and this on metal (acoustic) since it reduces squeaking and strings are easier on heavy gauge fretwork and my calluses.	1
Very good!	1
Works as advertised	1
I was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is.  I really like the right angle plug for my amp, it doesn't make the wire 'stick out' like a straight plug would.  Good stuff.	1
This cable worked fine for a short while. I didn't put it through much abuse and the jack developed a break. The price was good and I have no complaints about it otherwise, but be wary of this jack design. There's no repairing it unless you buy a new jack and solder it yourself.	-1
It does what a cable does, and there isn't much more to say. Decent price and it is pretty good quality.	1
These are nice chords and they work well, but they're not as durable as Monster Cables, so I have to mark them down a bit. I've had issues with one of the two cables I bought, but this occurred after about a hundred gigs.	1
Based on the number of positive reviews, I bought the 20ft right angle version of this product to use with my Fender Jazz bass.  When I received the cable, I was a little concerned about the light gauge and feel of the cable.. but hey, it got great reviews.. so why not?  I used the cable last night and my signal faded ... repeatedly.  I wiggled the cable and got the signal back, then it happened again.. no signal.  I pulled out several of my backup cables and tried them all and had no loss of signal or cut-off.  I tried this cable again.  Same loss of signal.  I'm returning this cable, as I can't even recommend this product as a backup cable since it is unreliable.	-1
No brainer to keep some picks handy where you need them.  I stuck one on top of my amp. I may get more to stick other places too so I am not always searching.  I used to always try to keep a pick in the strings up the neck but then they fall out (or in the hole).	1
Works well.	1
I use this because chicken grease starts to smell after a while.  FE has a great scent.	1
I play hard and for what seems to be forever. No matter the brand of strings I use or the gauge my fingertips are brutalized. Recommended to me by a friend & bandmate, he had me spray some on my strings and hand. Now, I absolutely couldn't live without using this stuff. Not only does it do fingertips it makes necks so much faster. Same music, no more skinless fingertips afterward.	1
Outstanding Seller that delivers high quality items!	1
I've got this one in the living room so that my toddler grand daughter can't reach it.  I've got a Les Paul hanging from it (screwed into a wall stud) so it'll handle a heavy guitar.  This bracket has two screws and the Y hook.  I've got these with a number of different brands on them including a Martin but they are all the same, hardwood block with a threaded metal insert for the hook.  It's secure and unobtrusive.  A guitar that's hidden away in the case doesn't get used.  I need all the practice I can get.  :-)	1
I really like this cord, it rolls easy, its long, and its got a great powdery feel to the material. I suggest having multiple of these so length won't be a problem, got 6 of'em myself, all sound great, (Right angle or Straight).  Great buy, cant go wrong here.	1
I haven't measured signal throughput so I can't comment on that.  But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle.  This thing simply will not crimp, will not kink up on itself, does not get twisted and has no tension in it.  It's the easiest handling cable I've ever dealt with, a real pleasure when you've got all kinds of wires running all over.  It's like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy, and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections.  I have a 10-footer with one right-angle connection, and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a Telecaster.	1
I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive, yet lightweight, flexible, and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness, which feels nice at first and feels "more studio," but when you're actually using the cable, it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance, Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.  For just a few bucks more, I prefer Pro Co Excellines, since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler, just call Sweetwater), which feels nicer to me, but I like these just fine.	1
I don't curse, by nature.  But I'd estimate that 90% of the cursing I have done has been out of frustration at that awful noise of a guitar cable shorting. KkkkkKKKkkkkKKKKk!  No more - if you're shopping, there's no need to go on: you're here. Buy the lengths and types you need and you're set up. Lifetime warranty - that tells me a lot. And rubber coating right up to the plug. I've used these for several years now, and can't imagine a reason to switch.	1
this item is light in weight and you can stick it on the side of your guitar to hold many different picks, you will make sure to fine you picks the next time you need them	1
This is fine as a general stick-on inexpensive pick holder. It doesn't hold very many picks, but it really doesn't have to. I would give this five stars except that I really prefer the Planet Waves LED key chain/pick holder over this. It costs more but has more functional value to me. If all you need is something very simple, and you have a surface you can stick it on, then this is fine.	1
This is exactly what I was looking for to go into my case or my pocket. I will not put this on the back of my guitar but you do have the option. Perfect fit for medium picks. Ease of use, and durable. Have purchased another one! Good deal!	1
I love this stuff and have been using it for years.  It really makes my guitars more comfortable to play and keep the strings clean and gives them longer life in my opinion.	1
Great product, great service.	1
The product seems to work, I have less finger pain when playing.	1
I've been using this stuff for years. It takes away that squeak that can get annoying when you are trying to record. It makes the strings feel almost like coated strings without the tone loss of coated strings. I spray it on the strings/fretboard and the back of the neck every few days before playing so I have a smooth playing experience. It also helps keep the strings clean and alive. Love it.	1
Used this stuff for 30 yrs. on my strings / fret wood & back of neck. keeps the fret-wood from drying out too. Try it before you knock it.	1
I might have done something wrong... I read in a review that these hold six picks. It held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart... I'll just keep using my pockets.	-1
If you're always dropping picks, losing picks, breaking picks, this is perfect to have. Fits about 5-8 guitar picks or so. Stickies onto your guitar, wherever. There seems to be enough sticky-ness to move it around a few times and still have ti grip like new.	1
I like this little pick holder, it has the sticking part there with just a peel off and is easy to place on your guitar. It also does not damage the guitar if removed, the pick holder was really helpful.	1
I bought eight of these for my Instruments and couldn't be happier! They're solid, easy to install and strong! (The package gives the max load as 15 pounds)They easily take the weight of my Dean ML and Gibson Explorer. And, the arms of the yoke are slightly adjustable, out or in, (To accommodate the neck of a seven or eight string for instance) I plan on purchasing some more for my basses.	1
I like the shape of the prongs on this hanger.  I like the nice walnut finish also.  The construction is excellent for a wood type hanger.  The price is unbeatable.  I do notice that the wood version does stick out much further from wall than the metal type.  Might affect your decision when purchasing a guitar hanger.	1
I bought this for my brother who plays a  five string Fender Jass Bass.  And the 20ft length allows him more freedom to move around when he's performing.  The sound quality that this cable gives an instrument is phenominal especially for the economical price; there is less static and you can hear the higher tones without it sounding choppy or muffled.  With this patch chord, his bass sounds a lot fuller and cleaner; it's perfect for stage performances because he doesn't have to be beside the amp the whole time.  He's had this for over three months now, and used it in three concerts and once every week for Church choir practice and it still sounds perfect.  I would recomend this product believing that this is the greatest quality cable you can get for the price that it is.	1
Nice one, small, soft, cheap cable with comfortable lenght. Nothing else I can say :) Take it for cheap guitars.	1
these cables are nicely constructed. i bought them for home use only. home recording or just practicing. they seem to work well so far. i wouldnt gig with these on a regular basis, but for home use, with little abuse, they should last.	1
It's a cable. It's got two connectors. Not much to it and it does the job. The connectors are single pieces which is nice compared to some other cables such as Fender's which have a tendency to unscrew themselves over time.	1
I've been playing the guitar for over 20 years I've used all type of cables and the ones from Planet Waves gives you what they promise "very good value for money" unlike cheap cables this one gives you a clear tone without or very little static noise. I play my Epiphone Explorer GT through a Fender Mustang III I only get the static noise when using a lot of overdrive and distortion. Seems to be built with good quality only will tell if it can last.	1
Slick Teflon soothes fingers,gets rid of scratch and squealing.apply on finger tips then to strings,	1
If my band was an 80s hair band this would be our Aquanet	1
Must need for sticky fingers!!	1
Amazing for playing	1
I have been using FingerEase for a few years now and I must say that I almost couldn't live without it. It has many uses, I first purchased it many years ago on a whim, just to use it as a string lubricant hoping it would help me play faster and reduce the irritation on my fingertips when sliding my fingers on the strings. Let me tell you, it did indeed help with those problems, but it took me a little bit to discover it's most helpful use. My hands are almost always sweaty, so early on in my playing my strings never lasted very long. I would either have one break on me in a week or two, or the strings would become flat and dull sounding long before they should've. This was early on, when I didn't know much about the guitar, so I didn't realize that it was my sweaty hands causing these problems. Simply by chance I picked up some FingerEase at my local music store. Without me even noticing at first the life of my strings was at least doubled. I kept using it to reduce friction and cut down on,the sliding sound of my fingers against the strings, and slowly I started to notice my strings lasting longer. This product does a great job keeping strings clean, noise free, all while making them smoother to the touch. I tried elixer strings once or twice and I loved the way that they felt and the ease of playing with them. They are quite pricey though, and the coating never lasts long. This product will turn any strings you want into elixers, adding the same sort of coating, but without you having to worry about it coming off, because you can just give it another spray. I use Ernie Ball Cobalt strings, which sound wonderful, but I have read many,people complain that for the price they go dead fast, but I have yet to have that problem. A 4 dollar can of this lasts me nearly a year with liberal use, and makes my 10+ dollar strings last much longer. Great value for a great product A++	1
Love this stuff.	1
Great product for nylon or steel strings. I have been using Fingerease for many years and it does what it's supposed to. Also a good value, as the can lasts a long time.	1
It smells good.	1
Its solid. Has great quality. & doesn't short out on you. I had it for a few months now & not a tear anywhere in site Planet Waves printed on the cord "guaranteed for life" i think they mean it XD	1
This cable is really good for the price! i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet. Would like to purchase another one in the future. Buy it! it's worth it	1
I've purchased a few Planet Waves cables and they have all been decent quality.  I would definitely recommend this brand.  15 feet is a much better length for me because I like to move around when I practice.  I think I would've prefered a coiled cord though.	1
I received this beauty on January 5th. I can honestly say it hasn't disappointed me and I doubt it will.	1
I got this for my daughters guitar and this cable is the toughest cable for guitar I have seen/delt with. It is wonderful and especially tough for kids!! Good buy!	1
It has what you want in a cable, and not what you don't.  Not insanely priced from having pixie gold dust sprinkled over it, but quiet and supple and uses good quality plugs on both ends.  So there it is; nothing magical, just a guitar cable.	1
Don't want your guitar/bass on a stand or just laying about for others to trip over and/or sit on?  Want it to look cool up on a wall but are afraid it will come crashing down like you're at one of The Who's concerts?  Enter the String Swing.  It's affordable, it's easy to mount, looks good, and it holds your axe securely allowing visitors to gaze upon its beautiful glory.  Just make sure you mount it to something sturdy (not for use in a cardboard box home for instance).	1
ok	1
This stuff is worth its weight in gold!!! I will definitely keep this stuff in my gear bag.	1
This Guitar String Lube is incredible!	1
Been using this for many years, good stuff !	1
Great Guitar Lubricant	1
A good cable for the money. Could have better stress release, but certainly plenty good enough for normal use and a very good value.	1
Simply, these are great cables. They snap right in, carry sound well, and come with a lifetime warranty. The 15' length is just about right, and at about one dollar per foot a good value. Recommended.	1
This cable is of very poor quality.  Constant buzzing, and loss of sound depending on the angle of the cable.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats, and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality, since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.  We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.  Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.  Specs - 10', 1/4" mono (tip)	1
Great quality, I've abused this cable a lot and its held up. Plus they have a lifetime warranty. Which I don't know about since I've never had to use it, because these things last forever!	1
Been using this product for 50 years, great.	1
I like the ease of use and it works	1
Use it on all 12 of my guitars. People complaining about making your fingertips soft, if you read the instructions it helps to spray and wait a while for it to dry. If you spray it on and immediately start playing eruption yeah your fingertips will absorb the stuff in, easy fix is to wait a bit, let it dry and it works fine for me.	1
Works great, I use it all the time.	1
An excellent string cleaner/lubricant. Extends life of strings.	1
The product itself is great! It does what it advertises, but the only reason I gave it four out of five stars is because of how you apply it. Spraying it can be very messy and after applying it 5 times, I still can't apply it cleanly. I always test out products on my lower-end guitars first and the spray is hard to master. If you also spray down past the 12th fret, you're most definitely going to get some of the product on the body of the guitar and, well, it'll appear as little dots because of the spray. You'll have to clean it up with a damp cloth and that's too much work!  Although the product itself is great, it is just too messy for me. I much prefer the GHS Fast Fret.	1
As per description. Best product use for my dry neck.	1
I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did, I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick, its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement, I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on.	1
Very nice, smooth, no sharp edges, not much bigger than the picks it's holding (it holds about 10 of my favorite thin Mel Bay picks) ... the only issue is, the spring clip that pushes the picks to the top, is a little too strong, and was warping my thin picks, but I just put one very stiff pick at the bottom of the pile, and it's fine.  Addendum:  After a few years, I needed some more of these ... the new ones are exactly the same, except they've redesigned the shape of the spring, and I no longer need to protect the picks on the bottom of the pile from warping.  Addendum 2:  Lost one, gave a few away, bottom line is I needed more, so I just went to the product description and added half a dozen to my cart.  The latest batch are not the new design that I mentioned above, they are the old ones that warp my thin picks.  I won't bad mouth the vendor who sent me the old style, but I will say the new design in my previous order where "Sold by: Brook Mays" ... it matters who you order from.	1
I got this to hold some of my picks so they don't fall around everywhere when traveling. My only complaint is that these can only hold about 7 or 8, otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase.	1
EDIT 10-8-2015:  Just bought a couple more.  I think I want one on every guitar. Gone are the days of picking up a guitar and not having a pick handy!  This is my second purchase. Love the one I have been using for a couple years. Bought this for another guitar. I really like that it is very small compared to similar ones. Holds other brands too if they are similar. Good product.  Click YES below if this review is helpful.	1
I have used many of these in my studio and house. The wood part is nice because it can be painted to match the wall color if so desired. Definitely use both of the sheetrock anchors and you shouldn't have any problems. The little o-rings aid in keeping the guitar from slipping off, but I've used these without then and had no problems, never had a guitar fall. The light brown material on the "Y" part is very gripping. You just turn guitar slightly sideways and pull out.  You spent all that money on your Axe why not display it like a piece of Art!	1
Bought our 13 year old daughter a guitar for Christmas.  We have four dogs and two cats so keep it off the floor is a MUST!  Plus a room full of 13 year old girls can do just as much damage so I love this product.	1
Back when I was doing the rigging for deep purple and Ted Nugent they all used this get down mo jo juice and it works I have NEVER seen it stain anything including some good lookin chicks it works BUY-IT !! and PLAY like your on FIRE !!!	1
I've been using this stuff for about 8 years or so and I really don't play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy.	1
I've been using Finger Ease for a few years now. I play mainly acoustics with rosewood finger boards and it works well. It's not a substitute for treating the wood which should be done as part of a regular maintenance routine, but for occasion use to reduce friction, it's the right stuff. It might cause a little noise when sliding between cords when first applied, but that goes away quickly and your left with a nice feel. I don't know that it extends or shortens the life of the strings, but I change mine pretty often, and wipe them down after each use, so it's not a big deal.  I can highly recommend this product. It does what it's supposed to do, and that's make the guitar a little more enjoyable to play. If you haven't tried it, you should.	1
I play weekly so I go through a lot of this. I like the way it cuts down on finger noise and smooths out bending strings on my maple fretboard.	1
Have had no problems using this both for guitar and for an electronic drum setup.  The cable coils very well and I haven't had any noise issues whatsoever.	1
I really like PW cables, actually. Reasonably priced, coil easily, and last for years (my current set have served me well for going on three years now, with plenty of gigging and getting stepped on),	1
The Planet Waves Classic Series 10ft Instrument Cable is basic, but works great and is very flexible.  Seems sturdy enough to last a long time.	1
This is a great cable if you have a guitar or any other instrument that has a front facing input jack. The only issue I've had so far is some cutting of the signal through it one time. It hasn't occurred since, but I'm still skeptical and leery while I'm using it.	1
I was using the bigger triangle kind before. The one that's more universal. But I only use the tortex pics. So I got this. They fit perfect. And they don't move around so much like with the bigger triangle one.	1
My son, who is learning banjo, is constantly losing his picks and can never seem to find one when he needs it. This handy little holder is a great place, spring loaded, to hold one pick or enough for a pick party. Perfect for keeping the pick family together.	1
It's a good, cheap pick holder.  There's an adhesive patch if you want to stick it to something.  Holds roughly 7 picks.	1
I have been fortunate to build a small, but decent collection of acoustic and electric guitars in a room dedicated to music. All 15 of my guitars are hanging on the walls and in the 15 years I've been using String Swings I've never had a problem with them. They hold every guitar, regardless of neck shape or style. Since they swivel, my Fender necks are just as secure as my Gibson necks. The depth is adjustable, so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics. While I never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my Nitro coated guitars, I didn't want to take a chance, so I use self-adhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitar's finish. I try and screw them into studs to support the weight, and where I can't do it, I hang some of my lighter guitars, but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure... although I sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screw-in anchors; but made out of metal - just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens. I also strongly recommend (as others have done) that you run a humidifier in the room housing your guitars (40-50% humidity is perfect). I recommend the Honeywell&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Honeywell-HCM-6009-QuietCare-9-Gallon-Output-Console-Humidifier-with-Air-Washing-Technology/dp/B000G0LDRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Honeywell HCM-6009 QuietCare 9-Gallon Output Console Humidifier with Air Washing Technology</a>	1
Juist what I wanted good price and good quality. I would buy this again when I need another one Highly recommed,	1
The lubricant may work well but my bottle arrived damaged.  The product squirts out from the side into your face when you use it.  I assume I just got a defective bottle.  Hopefully, I can return it for another bottle.	-1
love this product.  makes playing so much easier on the fingers and cuts down on the squeeking when moving up and down the fretboard.  I've used this for many years and will continue to use it.  much better than other similar products on the market.	1
This stuff is great. The other guys are always coming over and grabin a shot or two cause I leave it in the pedal board. Iv'e been using this for years. I like smooth slippery strings for speed and ease. Humidity  not a problem with this stuff. .	1
I was skeptical and thought it could just be a gimmick but I got to a point that I didn't want to play anymore because it was eating up my fingers. It doesn't help that I use 12s and 13s on my guitar but I love the tone the big strings have! So, I ordered this hoping it may at least ease the pain. It's like playing on clouds! And I can slide up and down the neck without all the noise.	1
as a guitarist for 10 years... i've played just about every cable there is. I've even made my own... however nothing compares to the quality of planet waves.	1
I have both the 20 ft cable and several 6 foot cables. There is a BIG volume loss when using the 20 foot cable. I expected some loss, but this is almost to the point of being unacceptable.  If my amp is normally at 2 (out of 10), I have to crank it to 4 or 5 with this one plugged in to get the same volume.	-1
Nice cable. right angle end may not fit some guitars. Just flip it around. I got it for a guitar with jack on the front.	1
I own several of these cables in various lengths and am very pleased with the quality and performance of them. I use this particular length cable for patching various pieces of audio gear in a rehearsal space or for plugging into a direct box on stage.  The ends are solid when connected and the cable material itself is very 'slinky', i.e. not stiff or difficult to work with like some other cables tend to be.  And a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price.	1
It came in nice packaging. Cable looks great - feels of high quality. So far it still works well.  10 ft is nice for home. If you're a performer... longer is required.	1
I am pleased.  This cable works fine and is priced right.  The one right angle end piece is just what I needed to connect to the rear of my  keyboard while enabling it to be as close to the wall as possible.  Note that his is not an expensive high end cable.  My 5 star rating compares this product to other  value priced cables. That said, this cable is made well.	1
I can't remember how many years ago I started using this great stuff.  Like everything else, moderation is the key and having good clean neck and strings is where it all starts, but a quick spray and a wipedown with a lint free cloth does wonders before every time I play!	1
If you haven't used this stuff, and if you plan to play 'squeak-less' guitar, take the risk. Buy some.  You'll wonder how you ever played without it.  You might even become the next Joe Satriani!	1
It claims to stop "string talk," when you rub fingers on wound strings. It doesn't. But it does reduce it somewhat, and it also helps me keep playing even when my fingers get sore from playing too long, or playing a new song over and over.  I gather my fretting fingers together and spray a little bit of this stuff right onto my fingertips. Seems to help my callouses without messing them up, and reduces the tenderness under the callouses that comes after a lot of playing.	1
I've been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding. It provides a terrific slick feel to the fretboard and makes playing much easier and more enjoyable. Clean, no residue from repeated use, and the glide across the strings is super nice. I use it regularly on my USA Stratocaster maple neck and wouldn't leave home without it.	1
Makes the strings nice and easy to fly over. No buildup, or residue on your fingers either. I like this stuff.	1
I bought a new guitar & got it a day before my fingerease was delivered. My fingers were squeeking & sticking on the strings & back of neck, BAD!!After applying fingerease no more squeeks & much easier to move up & down the fretboard!!This stuff has been around for years. 1st time I saw it was 40 years ago. Can't argue with that track record!!If you never used it get a can, you won't regret it!!   Joe BTW: anybody that's watched Nirvana Unplugged will see how much they (& most bands) love & depend on fingerease esp on acoustic strings. Can't remember the songs they were between but they went on for quite a while. "Where's the f'in fingerease?" Lol!!	1
I used to change my strings at least every week, and they'd be all gunked up and rusted out in that time, feeling like playing on dusty old pieces of rope.  Now with a fresh string change I spray them down liberally with Finger Ease, and use it occasionally over the life of the strings to keep them going.  I can now stretch out a set of regular Ernie Ball's to about a month or so, even longer when I'm lazy.	1
I have about 6 of these now installed in my office. It takes just a few minutes to find a stud and drill the necessary holes. No complaints.	1
As good looking as it is functional. Will be buying more for other instruments. Installs easily on any kind of surface.	1
Love these. They're sturdy . Which is very important and was my biggest concern since my guitars are pretty heavy. They look so cool on the wall and everyone compliments and noticed my guitars now. Love this so much. Highly recommended	1
I've been using this product for many years. It has always worked well for me. I just spray a little on my hand and then rub the neck and strings, and I'm good to go!	1
Apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad I did. Not an everyday product - but when your strings still have their tone but have lost a bit of their glassy feel . . . start to feel scratchy, this is a quick fix until you're ready to re-string.	1
I've used this product for years and love it ,,,it was very nice to get it at such a low price !  shipment was fast and packaged very well...will order this again from KMC Music Thanks	1
I have been using GHS for a long time. Found a deal on this and thought I'd give it a try. Works about the same but does seem a little less greasy.	1
Pros: Works great, no weird noises or anything.  I try not to step on it too much and it's just in my home so no tuffness award or anything.  Cons: Do yourself a favor and get a longer one if your using for a guitar or something like that.	1
I haven't used the cable yet, but it looks new and durable. The cable appears to be structurally sound around end connections and seems to be what I expected. Can't wait for the rest of my gear to get here so I can do a sound test. Based on physical condition, I would recommend this product.	1
This cable bends with ease and feels like it will never break.  It doesn't have any stiffness to it, and it has substantial weight.  Even though a cable came with my guitar and also with my amp, I am very glad that I bought this cable.	1
Even though the picture is inaccurate, this cable is great for the price. It has one right angle, and one straight. It works prefectly with my guitar and the 20ft range is amazing. It doesnt get in my way and it has fantastic sound and construction quality. I would reccommend getting this for people wanting to use this to perform and stay within their budget. 5/5	1
I've come to the point where anytime I buy a new guitar cable it is a planet waves. They are good quality, decently priced, and I don't have to worry about them shorting out on me. Definite buy.	1
Helps speed up my playing. I wait 10 seconds before touching it and then I slide my fingers up and down the string to make sure it sets.	1
This product definitely makes guitar playing more simple by slightly lubricating the neck and fretboard of a guitar. It was a must before shows.	1
I have used this product all my life to reduce string "talk" &  fret fingering fatigue.  Doesn't seem to affect fingerboard wear & probably reduces fretboard dryness.	1
I typically use this with my acoustic gigs, due to the fact that stings can get grimy when you're playing 6 days a week and I don't really enjoy changing my strings few days. If you're playing a lot of leads (which I do when I use my looping pedal) this product will help with wear and tear on your fingers as well. I currently play on cruise ships and 4 or 5 hour nights, 6 days a week, can get to be a little tiresome.  Using this product with electric guitars tends to make the neck too slippery for my taste, but that's just my opinion.	1
I couldn't play the rapid style without it. Just great stuff.	1
Reduces string noise as promised.  Makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise.  I think they also do reduce some finger soreness as your fingers aren't as irritated from sliding on bare strings.  Makes them feel kinda like elixirs, but sounds a lot better and you still have the naked strings feel.  Also does make the neck a lot smoother.  I will be buying more for all my guitar cases.	1
With musical instruments standing about on my office floor, I determined to find a better way to keep them available, and so I decided to hang them on the walls. This hanger was very easy to install. It comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself, or through drywall and into wall studs. I used the pre-drilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily. But a word of warning: use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall. If you don't, your guitar will hang a bit cock-eyed.	1
Holds ~8-10 picks depending on thickness. I stick it on top of my amp so ive always got a pick close by.	1
Nice little device.  We'll see how long it lasts (a cheap little plastic thing really) but so far it does the job and holds about 6 or so medium picks easily without issue.  I use it with the medium dunlop picks.  Glad I got it.	1
I really like the color, as they make my LED can seem richer in color.  The only issue is any kind of liquid will smear the color.  But for the price, I won't complain much.	1
Been using this forever. It smells great, sounds weird but it does. Seems to be working as described. I am going to keep buying it	1
Been playing guitar for over 37 years and I have tried everything out there that has been available to me. Somehow, I always keep coming back to finger ease. After all these years I still tear my fingers up because of the bends and harmonix I perform. I am also a bit of an aggressive player and dig in harder than a normal player would. This stuff gives my fingers relief were no other product has.	1
I've been using Finger Ease for years and always will on my acoustic and electric guitars. It has multiple uses:  -Cleans off residual oils and buildup from your hands, extending the life and tone of your strings  -Lubricates strings and neck for faster and smoother playability, though this effect does typically wear off after an hour or so  -Works decently well as a polishing agent to rub off finger prints, etc. from the top, sides, and back, will not harm most finishes (as far as I know)  I usually just apply it before playing but using it after could definitely be beneficial as well.  I did read that the compound is conductive and should be kept off of your pickups to avoid interference. I'm not sure if this is true as I've never noticed any problem when the spray gets on my humbuckers. However, I typically try to keep it off of electronic  components in general just out of common sense.  For under ten bucks, the can will last you awhile.  Just order a few at a time and find free shipping, you'll find yourself wanting one in each guitar case all the time.	1
I have never used this on the strings or the fingerboard so I cannot comment on that. I do use this for the back of my guitars that have polished necks on them. Which I use a couple of mine for playing out. As some of you know, when you play out you tend to sweat and that makes it hard to play on a polished neck. With the Fingerease, this helps out tremendsly. Just spray some on a clean cloth and wipe on the neck, let it sit for a couple minutes and it cleans and smooths it right up without making it greasy. I usually just wipe some all my guitars before I got to play a show. It's really good for this purpose.	1
I was hoping this product would eliminate string "talking" and had mixed results.  It helped some but didn't get rid of the noise entirely.  It also makes the strings feel nice as well.  I will continue to use it.	1
I have been playing for 35 years, about 9 of them professionaly. I have also worked as a set-up man, and, made guitars both acousctics and hard body that people seem to really like. I am a graduate engineer by trade. Anyway I have used this product as well as many others and prefer it. The only down side is it is an aerosol. However it does not contain any chiorocarbons or fluorocarbons and claims not to harm stratospheric ozone. It does contain aliphatic hydrocarbons however it works great without any oiliness. In my humble opinion this is the best choice as a string lubricant.	1
I hated having to put the pick between strings.  And now that I have a ton of picks, I can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar.  Im still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish, and I don't want to ruin it.  But the instructions say it should be fine.  I think I might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well, still deciding on that.  But for the price you pay for this, it's a no brainer for any musician.	1
Great ideal but when you grab a pick you get like 3 or 4 at a time. I must have fat fingers...you may have better luck.	-1
The item came well packed and also in perfect condition. I'm very glad. Thanks.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fender-351-Premium-Celluloid-Guitar-Picks-12-Pack-Abalone-Medium/dp/B0002E2XOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fender 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks, 12 Pack, Abalone, Medium</a>	1
This Dunlop "Ergo Pickholder" is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy, especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:  + Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar + Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed + Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picks  My only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick, you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.  Recommended  CFH	1
i bought one, then i bought two more, then i bought two more.  these things are well made (in the good ol' US of A), look good, and are a deal.  none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall, which is good, right?	1
I have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars, banjos, and mandolins.  They attach to the wall with 2 screws.  Hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall.  It takes about a 1/4 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic.  The piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone/rubber which protects the instrument.  The holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have.  I have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again.  Very sturdy, well made product.	1
This is a lovely wall mount for your guitar. Comes with everything you need (except a drill or a screwdriver of course). It is pretty and very strong. I originally purchased it to hang on drywall (sheetrock) for my 5 year old's mini guitar but once I had it mounted I found that it is strong enough to hold MY ELECTRIC guitar, which is quite heavy and that is amazing to me because usually that kind of weight would pull a mount right out of the sheetrock. This is a good buy.	1
accumulates & stores & sticks to guitar - Great !! Wish I'd have bought 4 !!	1
I lose picks constantly. Years ago I resorted to placing them between the srings in the neck of the guitar when Im not playing it. That of course leads to bent picks and still, lost picks. This thing is great. I load it up with alternating  (hard and soft) picks so I can easily swap out between songs. Best $3 I've ever spent.	1
I like this product and the idea behind it but it seams that when I try to pull one pick out I get two or three coming out at the same time. It can hold 5 (at least for me). Overall, I would recommend it. I bought one for myself and one for my 7 year old's guitar.	1
nice gels that worked well in my older lights.	1
I have 4 of these and really do like them. They hold a variety of guitars securely in place (Stratocaster, Telecast, Les Paul and a custom made). Installation was simple. I have mine lined up with studs as I don't trust using only the drywall anchors. No problems with the order on Amazon. They're good quality and the price is right.	1
I take care of my guitars. The acc/electric I got used in 1985 still looks like the day I got it. The electric I got in '97, and gigged with for 2 years, still looks almost new. How? I keep them off the floor and on the wall or in the case.  This item beats the case. Find a stud, drill the starter holes, run the screws and you could hang a small child up by their belt. So it will hold any guitar you may have. If you cannot find, or use a stud, this comes with drywall inserts too. I have used both methods and the string swing works great.  I have 5 guitars and 5 string swings. I keep one stand for jam sessions and 'just in case' I find a cheap keeper of a guitar. Then I buy another string swing.	1
I had purchased one a while back for my electric and then my acoustic was always leaning against the wall so I had to get another for my acoustic. Super simple to install and very sturdy once installed.	1
Nice, holds picks better then my old one, and best of all... It comes with one free disintegrating pick! It is really awesome, all you have to do is alt-pick in 16th, and watch it dissapear before your very eyes! Lol, great product though.	1
This pick holder will hold about 3/16" worth of picks.  I think that I was able to fit 8 .50mm picks in it at once without worrying that they would fall out.  Fits very nicely on the headstock of my Takamine and does not detract from the look of the guitar.	1
This thing holds a ton of picks, it'll even hold one of the 5mm rubber picks I own! I can fit 5-6 picks in it, but since I use assorted picks (most of them thick since I play bass), you might be able to fit more in than I can. With the flexible metal strip "spring" of sorts that it uses to hold the picks in, it's fairly limited to what it can hold, I think that it could be modded and bent a bit to allow one or two more picks to be put in.  Mine came with a transparent red pick in it, but I don't know if this is an actual pick or just a piece of plastic, but it seems sturdy enough to be used as a pick. I'll use it a bit and see if it breaks with just a little bit of wear and tear, then I'll edit this review. Otherwise, this is a great pick holder! I would highly recommend it to anybody.	1
i bought this to make sure i had a pic on me while im playing instead of looking for one .....  i put it on my guitar strap and it stays!!! i thought it would fall off by ow but it has survived and i barely drop a pick but if i do i just slip down pick up another one  it holds about ten picks its cheap design..... but good for the price i payed...it won't fall apart and i need nothing fancy it serves its purpose	1
The price was so worth it! I thought it was not going to be that strong, but it is ITS PERFERCT	1
Great product; This will be my fourth purchase. They work great for electric and acoustic guitars. Make sure you read the title they also make hangers for mandolins and violins. These are much smaller.	1
This is a great all around bar.  I will probably never use my Stevens type bar again!.  The bottom is more rounded than a Stevens bar.  For me this makes the GS glide over the strings much easier and it makes it easier to get a nice gentle vibrato by rocking the top of the bar back and forth.  The edges make for great clean pull off's.  I think the tone is better on the lower strings than the Stevens bar.  This is probably because the profile of the GS is more rounded and there is less contact area.  The wooden top of the bar is larger and more contoured than the Stevens.  This makes it very easy to grip.  This can be especially important if you have any hand problems that make it difficult to grip or hold on to a steel bar with a smaller top part.  The wood feels better than cold steel in your hand too!  I would strongly recommend giving this bar a try.  Especially if you aren't too fond of the grip on a Stevens type bar or if you have hand problems.	1
Sounds great on all strings. Fit big hands very well . It is the one I grab out of 6 I have	1
When I first started playing dobro, this steel was WAY more comfortable to my hand than the Lap Dawg. It's considerably taller, and the wood both feels nice and helps me keep a decent grip on the bar. The Lap Dawg made my hand cramp initially, so the extra height really seemed to help me get used to playing a square neck.  I did eventually switch over to the Lap Dawg as my primary steel, but I've recently started switching back and forth. Some of the differences between this and the Lap Dawg (which is currently my only other steel): * This is a bit longer. * This one significantly more angled edges. That makes it hard to switch back and forth. * This is stainless steel, and seems like it might be holding up better. My Lap Dawg's got a few dings and scratches. This has some tiny scratches but nothing I can feel on the strings. * As mentioned, this one's much easier to hold onto during a long jam because the wood doesn't get slippery like an all metal steel.	1
Just what husband wanted.	1
We bought three of these and they are just great. Mounting holes are drilled right, screws pass right through and fit perfectly. Comes with big, beefy drywall anchors and feels just right. Holds the guitar out at a safe distance. Highly recommend this over the other (way cheaper looking) ones that are a few bucks less. Spend the extra few bucks on these and SMILE.	1
This easily-installed hanger is of very good quality and does the job well.  I have to note that the pictured product is a bit different than what is shipped.  (There are no "O" rings toward the end of each arm.)  The straight-forward design that arrived actually is more to my preference, so ...	1
Perfect. exactly what I needed to add to our wall collection of guitars. Shipped promply, great price, Ad yes i will be ordering a few more in the future.	1
Works great for my acoustic dreadnought. If I had any complaint it would be that there's nothing to prevent the lower part of the guitar from banging against the wall. It would be nice if they had an option for something that could hang down off the hanger - a little cushion - that would go between the wall and the guitar. No reason I can't make something like that on my own, though.  Edit - 9/24/2013 - Just got my first classical guitar and realized that the wider neck won't fit into this hanger. Nothing worth complaining about, but just something to note - if you need a hanger for a classical guitar, this isn't it.	1
I have several of these in my music studio. Very sturdy and well-designed. Easy to install. Trust only the String Swing brand.	1
I ordered this item for my Fender P-Bass. It was shipped quickly. Once installed it securely holds my bass off the floor and takes very little room compared to a traditional stand. Very satisfied with the product.	1
I like the feel and weight.  It's just right for may hand.  The wood is very smooth.  I roughed it up a little for a better grip.  The machining on the steel is very smooth.	1
Easier to control than round units.	1
Had trouble holding on to an all steel bar.  The wood handle gives a solid grip.  Well worth the price.	1
My musical tastes have gone through quite an evolution since I started playing guitar 30+ years ago. As such, I've grown more and more interested in the tones that can only be achieved through older, vintage folk type instruments. I picked an old Supro lapsteel guitar a few years ago, and up until now have only been capable of extracting the musical equivalent of a screeching cat from it.  Fast forward to my having ordered a Shubb slide. As soon as I took it out of the package, I knew that what I was holding was a game changer. The slide has amazing balance, and seems to naturally fit into your hand in a way that provides a level of control that no other slide that I've tried previously had been able to achieve.  Thus far, I've tried a spare socket, a glass bottleneck slide, a Stevens contoured slide, and a few sizes of bullet slides. The Shubb GS (Gary Swallows) slide beats them all. I'm now afforded a great deal more control, and in turn, have been able to dramatically improve my technique. Even the subtle angled ends allow you to contact only a few strings at a time, that opens up new possibilities. The stainless steel bar is a generous 3 1/16 inch from end to end. The wooden grip is contoured to allow your fingers and thumb to naturally grip the slide in a way that provides for optimal contol, and reduces slippage. The wood seems to have a very very light satin finish (if at all) and seems like it will age gracefully to an even more optimal smoothness.  When you place the slide on a table or flat surface, it natually lands in the correct playing position, which is evidence of the fact that the perfect amount of balance has gone into the design of the slide.  While at first glance, this may seem a very simple device, and may even visually seem to be only a gimmick in its appearance, don't be fooled. This is one of those rare accessories that truly has the capability of taking your playing to the next level. If you're like me, and have been frustrated with learning to play a lapsteel or dobro, give one of these slides a chance before you give up on the instrument. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!	1
We bought these when we moved into our new house & they are perfect for our guitars. We have 3 guitars hanging in the living room and these sturdy hooks are a perfect match to our decor.	1
Works Great! Its a good product, Just what i expected. I expect to buy more of these in the future. And for its price its well worth it!!!	1
I bought 4 of these, they work well and look good. They defeat gravity every day, preventing my guitars from smashing the air hockey table or my daughters parakeet.  The worst part of these hangars is the stud sensor. To be clear, a stud sensor is not included. But mine sucks. I drilled several holes in my walls that were without stud. Don't worry, the wall anchors work great. But if you want less holes in your wall, and want to find some studs, get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CH-Hanson-03040-Magnetic-Stud-Finder/dp/B000IKK0OI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CH Hanson 03040 Magnetic Stud Finder</a>! It's stud finding awesome-sauce! Well, technically it doesn't find studs, it finds the nails or screws in studs. But you get the idea...  BUY IT OR HAVE RANDOM HOLES IN YOUR WALLS!!!	1
Many reviews cover the pro's of this item, so I'll be short only to add that they are very sturdy (when install properly...suggestion:  find a wall stud and use 3" screws for heavier instruments).  Used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 Strat's.  Haven't had an issue with any in the 4-5 months we've had them up.  On the electrics, we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cable.  The hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slipping.  Wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free.	1
Sturdy and simple. Yolk width can be (safely) bent to accommodate classical guitars and yukes. Of note, yolk screws into mount and I'm concerned that it might get damaged if I over-tighten it, so the yolk ends up not always staying level...	1
Shipped in time. Just what I have expected. looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to screw it on the wall.	1
I have a parlor guitar with a small neck and this shorter length works perfectly.  I've always used Dunlop slides - the construction is flawless, they sound great, and I've never been able to break one despite many (unintentional) drops.  I even like to use this on my other guitars.  It just BARELY will span a normal fretboard, but it feels more "nimble" than a longer slide that overhangs the fretboard.  No reason to take away from 5 stars.	1
As a female guitarist it's hard to find a slide to fit my little finger that isn't too heavy...this slide a a great fit, and not heavy.  I'll buy from this company again  .  fast shipping, well packaged.	1
The slide on the package says it fits a size 7 ring. If you are a size 6 or 7 ring you may want to go the next size slide- your fingers get sweaty and swell up a little while playing and you will want a little wiggle room so you can take it off. I am about size 5 ring size and I have a little wiggle room but not much. On my mandolin it creates a smooth and almost space sounding tone compared to the sound of a metal slide- different musicians prefer different sounds and I like the glass slide better then metal. With this slide I find that (if done right) vibrato of a note is more natural sounding and softer then a metal slide- again different musicians have different likes, research the sound you like before buying a slide for first time slide buyers.	1
Love the size and sound, fits great on my pinky. I use it mainly for my dobro bottelneck blues songs.	1
I bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and I found them to be extremely simple and quick to install.  The included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue, leaving the String Swing solidly connected to the wall.  If you are hanging a lot of guitars, making two rows (one high and one low) seems to be the best option.  I spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars I put up look nice and have a good, tight spacing.  I uploaded two pictures of my wall after I had installed nine of the hangers and I couldn't be more pleased with the look... the pictures are uploaded on this product page.  I have put up the other two hangers since I uploaded the pictures, so I will have to do new pictures, but the ones that I put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these.  The easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Black-Decker-BDL100AV-All-In-One-SureGrip-Laser-Level/dp/B004SQSU6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Black & Decker BDL100AV All-In-One SureGrip Laser Level</a>&nbsp;and a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall.  I just went down the wall making dots directly on the line, drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about 20 - 30 minutes.  I think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional-looking installation.  As far as the performance of the hangers goes, what is there to say?  The included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it.  As long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly, you will be in good shape.  I DO NOT, however, recommend buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/String-Swing-Home-and-Studio-Wall-Bumper-Brown/dp/B003JFTDMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">String Swing Home and Studio Wall Bumper Brown</a>, as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately.  EDIT: I put the other hangers up now and did NOT drill pilot holes.  The anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole.  Just mark the positions, use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion, then screw them in.  It took about 1 minute to put a new hanger up, but this was partially due to the fact that I was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line.  At any rate, you do not need to drill pilot holes; just nail and go!	1
Some people are not comfortable using the drywall anchors that are included with this hanger. If the drywall anchors are installed correctly you will have no worries about it pulling out of the drywall. I have used these drywall anchors for 10 years now to hang heavy wood blinds which are raised and lowered daily without anchor failure. Concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger. The only options are the drywall anchors. They are good to go.	1
Highly recommended by this high school music teacher. Solid materials and the wood base matches well in my home. Hooks won't bend.	1
I bought this hanger for my mandy; it is going to work fine. I have three hangers, one has a flat black metal back I like better. BUT I BOUGHT THIS ON LINE TO SAVE A SMALL TRIP TO THE GUITAR STORE.  123 Music company packed this small itemm in a huge box that the US Mail would not leave in my box. So I had to get in the car and drive to the post office and stand in line. After shipping ect. I saved no money and got my ----- busted too.	1
Not a perfect fit for my finger but close enough and the weight I like. If you like something a little heavier this is a good choice.  As my Dad used to say, "let the tool do the work." So, for me a heavier slide does the work.	1
Great tone on my resonator!	1
works great	1
This is a great slide for those who like the sound glass gives AND have small/slender fingers. For a woman, I have average-to-small hands. Compared to most men, they are very tiny. Finding a slide is very hard and I had to watch some videos and search around before I got a sense of what size might fit me. All that research paid off because this slide fits- it doesn't fall down over my ring finger knuckle. It gives good tone, and it's not too heavy. Compared to my metal Dunlop 220, this is a huge improvement. I like the sound of the 220, but the fit isn't right for me at all.	1
Very happy with my purchase	1
I installed this in two minutes. I was planning on just using my twist-n-lock drywall anchors I bought at home depot to install some shelving recently but that's what it actually came with. These anchors are great. I used an 11/64 drill bit for the pilot holes. Don't use a bigger bit. It might be tempting to use a 1/4" drill bit if you're thinking of the push in type drywall anchors. That would be a mistake. These are better and screw in. I used a manual ratchet screwdriver. The anchors go flush with the wall then you screw the wood screws into the center of the screw head and through. I recently installed several shelves in two apartments (a friend saw mine and wanted some too) and these are the anchors I used. Of course a stud is better and also if your drywall is already crumbling that's no good. For a typical well maintained house or apartment though this should be fine even without a stud. I have a Schecter five string bass hanging from it and I'm confident that's not going to pull out from gravity. A heavier screw would still work and add confidence than the one packaged. One such as the screws packaged in actual twist-n-lock anchors. Looks nice. Decent price.	1
Well, what else is there to say about something that just holds on to your guitar until you are ready to use it? The construction is fairly solid and does its job well. I wouldn't recommend trying to hang a cello from it. (Not that you would, but...)	1
All was good	1
GREAT FOR FOUR STRING INSTRUMENTS..	1
Pyrex glass slide. First one I had, wasn't pyrex. Only took one drop and awwww.  So why glass? They do have metal ones.  And makes a whole different tone. Players choice really.  I haven't mastered a slide yet, just thought would be good to have in my accessory compartment of guitar case	1
great	1
I found the glass slide to be sturdy and produce some wonderful sounds. It was packaged well, and arrived on time.	1
Small diameter, but perfect if you don't want is all the way down past the big knuckle on your ring finger.  The medium fits over my whole ring finger nicely (10.5).  This one sits just right above the knuckle.  Good for multi-string use, but won't cover all 6.  Glass slides are relatively cheap, I recommend buying 3 or 4 and trying several before you settle on "your" slide.  Cheers.	1
I just finished installing 12 of these and couldn't be any happier with the product.  It is a sturdily built product with EVERYTHING you need for installation.  I didn't think this was possible, but I actually found a product MADE IN THE USA !!!  I will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows.  I did NOT have the mis-matching color issue that others commented on - all I did was contact the seller (in my case Brook Mays Music) and ask if it was at all possible for them to closely match these since all 12 are going on the same wall.  They were extrememly responsive, even sending two emails concerning my request (basically saying they would do their best - but no promises).  Well, Brook Mays came through for me & I received (very quickly I might add) 12 of these that matched perfectly !!!  I will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again.  Another great experience purchasing items through the Amazon site !!!	1
Just as advertised	1
I like the short slide. It goes well with my 3 string Cigar Box Guitar. Depending on the sound I want, I go with glass or sometimes, I use a 3/4" galvanized conduit coupling. The thin conduit coupling doesn't sustain well, but has a unique sound. This glass slide is heavy enough to give lots of sustain. I need to get a short heavy brass slide next.	1
I ordered a medium and it was a little large, so I ordered th small. Unfortunately it was too small, so I gave it to a younger guitar player with smaller hands....had Nothing to do with the quality of the slide which is nice and heavy and gives a wonder full tone.	1
Nice looking. kind of like buying a happy meal, the surprise is the seeing which one is inside. the color and style is a crap shoot. i wanted oak but got maple. might buy 5 hoping one is the color i want then return the rest. The price was great i shopped around and could not find anything cheaper. holds up well. I got all the peices and screws. does look nice. small enough the color probably won't mater.	1
The wood block provides space so your guitar is not in contact with the wall (which you don't want if it's an outside wall).  It can be attached in studs or in sheetrock with the included screws. Note: it does have a weight limit, so if you have a vintage Les Paul, keep that in mind.  The swing feature is nice if you are "hanging 'em high".  Otherwise, you probably don't need that.	1
This Guitar Hanger is good looking, well made, and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my son's acoustic guitar on the wall in his room. Our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet, and so far that seems to be the case.  The hanger was easy to install (literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall) and is easy to use (just place guitar in the padded holder by the neck).  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
These little hangers helped me get my daughter's guitars and bass off the floor in her room and out of harms way (barring an earthquake) Great Amazon Pricing!	1
This is a great guitar hanger and for nine bucks you can't beat it. Just be sure not to hang your vintage guitars over head high. Heat rises. I think the headstock should be approximately head high. Super solid build. However, I have noticed that the stained finish looks rushed in some cases. Other than that, perfect.	1
I have too many guitars and don't play them all so instead of buying an extra case or stand I figured I could use some wall decoration.  This works perfectly and is easily installed with two screws.  Definitely recommend.	1
Works for acoustic guitars that do not have strap pegs at the top of the neck. Provides plenty of stability.	1
Brilliant little add on to make your strap work with many acoustic guitars.  It is one of those simple yet brilliant ideas.  It seems to be fairly well made and should be fine for most normal standing & playing.  The buckle clicks in easily and I have no problem in unclicking to remove it.  IF you're gonna be a player who moves the guitar around a lot...channeling your "inner Johnny Cash"... you might have an issue but for the majority of players I think this would work for you.  Glad I got it.	1
Outstanding. I recommend to anyone who wants to hang their guitars on the wall and have it look nice. Very solid indeed. I mounted right into where the studs are behind the wall and its not moving. I think these are a solid enough that I won't worry that one of my expensive guitars would fall off the wall. I bought 4, now I'm buying 2 more so I can hang them all.	1
My husband got Guitar Hero for Christmas and on a whim added one of these hangers to his wish list.  One of our friends got it for us, almost as a joke-- but then we mounted it and realized how handy it was!  It works wonderfully for our little plastic guitar, saves it from getting scratched up in the closet, and looks pretty darn cool.  Highly recommended!	1
Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas, but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks, depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood, really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest, but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward.	1
If you like a heavy slide for your second or third finger, this is it. Not for the pinky. This is a meaty slide, and short. If you want a heavy slide for high action this would work.	-1
good	1
great product! love it	1
Great product for keeping the "axe" handy.  whether I'm writing or practicing a new piece it keeps my Martin Guitar from getting knocked over or from sliding from the spot that I left it resting.	1
Works well - highly recommended.	1
Great idea works well	1
On and running with it in less than a minute. Wish I had bought it a long time ago.	1
Its not quick release! You press in the side with all your might and eventually it open. I have small finger (white now) so I with difficulty got a grip and opened it. If you are a man you will have trouble opening it.  My son is 11 and it took him a long time to open it and he can open anything!	-1
Perfect function, easy to set up and to use, and cheap.  5 stars!	1
Do not care for this product	-1
I bought this because i only had one button on the bottom of my guitar and i didn't want to put on a button near the neck. This lets you attach the guitar strap easily to the neck. It is strong and flexible. The quick-release feature is perfect for people that don't want to pull the strap over their head every time you take it or put it down. It looks like it is made with high quality materials and feels durable. It is so far serving me very well and i strongly recommend this strap. It also is so incredibly cheap and is well worth the price and more.	1
For the first time I am disappointed with a product. I do not blame AMAZON. The concept is fantastic, BUT the  design is flawed in my humble opinion. The release clips on the side are TO SMALL, to smooth CANNOT GRIP THEM ENOUGH TO RELEASE. MADE TO LOOK PRETTY AND NICE. MADE FOR BIG STRONG AND BIG HANDS MY HANDS ARE SMALL I CANNOT GRIP AND HOLD AND MAKE THE RELEASE At THE SAME TIME. Being as female, I assume this design is made for males only? I have other female friends who cannot work the clips either. I ENDED UP BREAKING OFF ON OF THE CLIP END SO I COULD USE IT> NOW I CAN GRIP AND HOLD AND RELEASE WHEN NECESSARY> EXCELLENT IDEA, POOR DESIGN.	-1
A recent review said their gallon jug came and it was just a plain plastic bottle.  Maybe since then, the company got their act together because my jug had the Chauvet label and looked just like the photo.  And it seems to work great with the Chauvet fog machine I have.  I've heard from many sources to stick with the same companies fog juice if you have their fog machine.... So I did.	1
Work good	1
I love to use these on my guitar strap. I can use one strap on several guitars.	1
A must have for all guitar players.  Buy several...they're a great deal.	1
Works great on my Blueridge acoustic. Easy to attach.	1
these are just plain great and useful if you do not have a button on the upper end of the bout.	1
Very secure, just a little awkward to snap and unsnap.	1
Works as it should. Keeps you from having to unloop the headstock lanyard on most acoustic straps.	1
Great thank you!	1
I purchased this for me, but then i realized my guitar doesnt need it so I decided to give it to my uncle, no regrets. Good price and good product quality.	1
Seems okay, but the problem for me is this adds too much length to my strap.  My strap is already on the shortest setting, and I can't make it any smaller for the length of this device.  So you see it's really an issue.  If you're small like me and play small guitars and need a small strap, you should be aware of this.  BTW, I tried wrapping it around and stuff, but nothing really worked.  It was also annoying to play with it attached.  The mechanism that connects the two ends together was a bit problematic for me as well, I couldn't squeeze the two ends properly for easy attach/release (although I might have learned to do it better over time).  I ended up getting one of those leather strap buttons and it works so much better, with nothing to clunk around and possibly injure my guitar.	-1
I bought one of these for every one of my acoustics; they're fantastic.	1
I really like this product. I have it tied to a Planet Waves woven guitar strap which I rated 5 stars as well. These are the first two items I have purchased from Planet Waves and both seem to be very good quality. The strap I think is one of their least expensive and I still think it is top notch.	1
Great hi hat stand that accompanies my DW 9000 double pedal - expensive, but well worth the price considering it stands up to many years of road abuse.  Get a quick clutch from remo and you will have the best stand on the market IMO.	1
I own it, I play it, and I think it's the best hi hat stand available. It's very smooth feeling, extremely well made, very adjustable, easy to set up and break down, folds for transport, and will last a lifetime. By the way, I play it hard- stomp on it with my foot. It takes a beating from me but handles it with no problems.	1
makes easy for removal	1
Quick, speedy, nifty.  This is great.	1
Works as advertised. I have one on both of my acoustic guitars. Great product.	1
I've used two of these on my acoustics for about five years now.  Others have written about if this can be trusted to hold a guitar.  That is just silly.  Of course it could.  I demonstrated this to a friend by wrapping this on a ceiling pipe in a garage and swinging from it.  Holds 200 lbs easy.  Haven't had a problem with them scratching the guitar head.  I do let the guitar rest off the guitar strap where some will hold the guitar so the trap is taunt.  That might make a difference.  Length has been no problem either.  If it was too long I would just have it wrap an extra time.  This does allow straps that were slightly too short for me to fit effortlessly.  The quick release is nice because I can get the strap out of the way as I'm putting it into the case.  Some of my straps have metal parts that would dig into the guitar if it was just laying there.  If there ONE thing I would do to change this is to give options other than black.  White or red would be better.	1
This clip is actually pretty strong, BUT it's to long for my taste, i thought i could hide it somehow to make it look as if my leather strap was actually atached to the guitar neck but it's too long for that. The good point is that it is solid, it holds very strong, you can pull from it and it dosen't clip off.	-1
worked perfectly on my acoustic guitar	1
I love these!  They're cheap and safely turn any strap into one that can attach without a strap button.  Indispensible.  I only use them with acoustic guitars, though.  It seems like electrics might be too heavy, but I don't know that for a fact.	1
perfect easy does exaxtly what u want!!! way better than using other strap pin and waaaaaay better than tying to headstock.	1
This is a great addition to the guitar strap that I purchased.  I had issues with it fitting on a Martin neck strap, but this item solved the problem and will make use of the strap much easier.  The quick connect is a bit touchy, but not too much to overcome.  Overall, I like this and am happy to have the ability to connect it to my guitar.  It's easy on, and easy off.	1
Clasp almost impossible to open, plus it's made backward from the instructions that show the female end is on the guitar, but it won't fit because it is manufactured wrong, the short string is on the wrong clasp so instead the ugly three prong male end dangles on the guitar and bangs against left hand every time you move to an open cord.  Note that the positive Reviews are from many years ago.  I might send it back just out of spite for tricking me into buying their manufactures mistake.  D'Addario - I'll never buy anything made by you again.	-1
I own 3 of these! I've been using this excellent guitar strap accessory for 2 years and have never had an issue. It's rock solid. My strap always feels secure and the clip-in function works flawlessly. Two thumbs way up!	1
Seems more secure than a shoelace	1
Great for ukulele strap attachment!	1
Secure strap to your peghead and releases easily for storage.	1
I'm a gadget lover and this is a good one.  It makes it very easy to attach or detach your guitar strap to/from the headstock of your guitar or ukulele or other stringed instrument.  Update on 1/1/15 I liked this so well but lost one side of it, so I ordered another and it's a dud.  The clasp is impossible for me to open, and it looks different.  It has a different logo on one side of the clasp as if it were from a different manufacturer.  I'm trying to decide whether $3.95 is worth the effort of sending it back.	-1
Just look at the ball-end windings with a magnifier or loop of OTHER BRANDS of strings! The plain strings have 4-5 twists, and wound strings are also under-wound, or unevenly wound! Then look at a set of Dean Markley's! ***PLEASE SEE THE COMMENTS SECTION FOR MY UPDATED REVIEW.	-1
i thought it was something else so maybe im being a bit prejudiced but hey ummm yea it kinda sucks	-1
The product quality is great, and worth the money.  The reason I rated 2 stars is because in actual use, having a guitar strap hanging off the neck by the tuning machines is not so ideal.  The strap gets in the way of your hand when you fret on the 1st and 2nd.  I ended up having a luthier mount a button on my guitar and it works much better.  I didn't want to put a hole in the guitar but it ended up being the best choice, I just hope one day I won't regret it by having the wood split.	-1
I bought these so I could have an extra set of string as I needed them.  I went to put these on and the E string unwound!  Really?  The biggest string?  Now out of Amazon warranty, and I have to see if the manufacturer will replace or refund.  Garbage!	-1
terrrible smell kinda like a burning fire smell I really don't like it, Ive gotten froggys fog swamp juice instead and that one is a bit pricier but it smells alot better and stays alot longer and is way thicker	-1
If by high density you mean it hangs out in the air, it works great.  I bought this for a small club, specifically for low lying fog.  Turns up, no matter where I put this or what airflow is going on, it hovers around 8-10 feet and chokes the customers.  Oh well.  Good times.	-1
I was very excited to try out the Dean Markely ProMag Grand Pickup but I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. It is nearly impossible to play without getting a loud tapping sound not just when using a pick but also when finger picking. I tried moving the pickup from the bridge to the neck side of the sound hole and every point in between but I cannot find a position that this annoying  sound is not present.	-1
Dude, horrible pick up. Maybe I got a bad unit but this "Flanging" effect or whatever it is sounds horrible. If you want to record a track 500 times than go ahead, other than that, spend some more money for a better pick up	-1
Don't buy this item! Arrived broken. I was so excitied to upgrade from my single coil pickup. But this Humbucker arrived broken. I was able to glue it back together. But now it makes a lot of noise and static.  It does not work properly.  * I want a replacement or a full refund.  - So far I have not got a response from the vendor, nor amazon.com. - I am terrible disappointed with this purchase and they are not trying to fix it at all.	-1
Came with no visible physical damage. Package was obviously never opened. Dead on arrival; even tested with three different amps.	-1
In all fairness I have not returned this pickup yet but I will and I am sure they will replace it with a new one.  I have another one I ordered in the past and it is still working but need to get this one replaced.	-1
yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable.	-1
did not stay on	-1
The pick arrived in a box large enough to hold about 1000 of them...so much for "go green". Though listed as large, it was much to small. It was also split. I am just to busy to return it.	-1
You'd think mxr would make a phaser as good as its namesake ... sorry.  Obvioulsy, when they sold out to Dunlop, something didn't go right ....  THIS phase 90 is a very aggressive 4 stage phaser that adds heaps of distortion.  If that's what you're going for, then sure go ahead buy it.  But if you're looking for creamy sweeps look elsewhere, perhaps the script logo version, or a small stone, or even the BBE Soul Vibe, but this is a phase 90 in name only.  I give it two stars because someone may want this kind of sound.	-1
These picks rely on having a healthy finger nail.  Wearing one made my split nail worse.  No good for flamenco strumming as catch the strings on the down stroke.  If you damage your nails badly try Fred Kelly freedom picks.	-1
It seems to add excisive amount of gain to my guitar... Doesnt sound good. Also, the light should be brighter...	-1
this thing does distort your tone and doesn't sound good. I read reviews on here before getting it, and though there are many bad ones, many of them, lol, I went ahead. that was a mistake. it distorts, it muddies and makes your guitar sound worse. sad cause mxr have a classic delay pedal, the carbon copy, and their distortion pedals sound cool and I plan on getting the metal one, fullborne? fullbore?  anyway, thankfully I returned it asap and am now going to get the tc electronics helix, which I recommend anyone planning on getting this one do. check out vids on youtube for the tc helix, it sounds great and has total control, while this has one knob, one!!!! the helix has speed, depth, feedback and mix, which is awesome, plus you can get custom made sounds via computer somehow, which while not a selling point for me, I'd rather make my own sounds, is a cool addition. so in short STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.	-1
I'm here to comment on my brief, hands-on experience with the new Moog Theremini. It's a serious update of the 1919 instrument, with lots of features, voices based on Moog's popular iPhone app called Animoog, pitch quantization (see below) and that desirable combination of analog control over stable, digital sound. Does it work? On the plus side, it's Deco-ish pretty, very portable, has a built-in speaker and stereo delay, and a very few presets I might actually use. Most are kinda wild and space-y. But the negatives for me sharply outweigh the positives.  Chief among the cons is playability. After four or five attempts to calibrate the unit via a built-in procedure, it still made the soundfield unworkably tight, resulting in as little as 1/8" difference between neighboring pitches. Aside from the calibration setup, there is no simple dial to adjust the field range or zero beat position (lowest note drops to silence here). This is a fatal defect for me. I have a slight tremor, and while I have no problem with a standard Etherwave or a SoundsLikeBurns, this turns "The Swan" into "The Earthquake." Shame. I should have suspected this when every single video I saw, including one from Moog with accomplished thereminist Dorit Chrysler, showed more woowoo than actual playing. Every one.  One point of pride in Moog's advertising is the pitch quantization, or autotuning. Problem is that if you go to more than adjacent notes, you hear every note in between, a  kind of zipper effect. Unusable. Besides, the real joy of a theremin is in the microtonal nature, like a violin. You don't put frets on a violin and then slide across them. It's a bell that doesn't ring, a whistle that blows no good.  Moog has also released some sort of  basic, user-assembled synthesizer kit, the most basic synth I've ever seen, in the same $300 price range. It's fine for basic introduction to subtractive synthesis and experimentation, but that's about it. I fear Moog has opened a foray into the toy business; we'll have to see what's next. But alas, the 'Mini is a miss as far as I'm concerned. Perhaps the next generation will mark some improvement in basic techniques. A software update might solve some problems. I love this company. My first synth was their Sonic Six, still a great basic synth if you can find it. I've visited the factory and been charmed by the great people working there. But we can file this one under "interesting try."	-1
I have several MXR pedals. Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-"script" version reviewed here). This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (Look up "MXR Phase 90 Mods," and "Erik's Corner" will show you how.) I made the "R28," "C11," and "C12" modifications. The result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. Finally, I tried adjusting the internal trim pot. On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. No luck. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION, AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90.	-1
Okay,  Color coding is a GREAT idea.  Divas will not use the red ball windscreen.  Why?  Because, from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.  No kidding!  I have had several tell this to me and my sound tech.  So save your dough, buy any color but RED.  Diva's!!!!  What can I say?	-1
Bad material, you can find better in dollar tree.	-1
I have 3 Concertinas. One made in German and One in Italy. I got this cheep "MADE IN CHINA" 20 buttons Hohner Concertina new from a local store more than a year ago..... played for about 2 week and I had to leave it inside the clothset because it has 2 sticky button and 1 button can't even pop back. The air button sometimes didn't even work. The F reed (control by the right hand side top row 3rd button)its tune is kinda between E & F and the C reed (Right hand side top row 1st button) is C#. That's why I let it sleeping there. I'm wondering why the other "MADE IN GERMAN" is also Hohner 20 buttons (But the model is Hohner International)I've have playing it for almost 10 years and never has any problem and all the reeds are still keeping tunes. I think its the reason of MADE IN CHINA. I paid less and get less quality.	-1
ohhhhh a rag	-1
I personally have found this cloth to be much to small to seriously clean my guitars. If you are looking for a good polish cloth I would look up the Ernie Ball 4220 cloth, It's cheaper, bigger and of better quality.	-1
Attempted to put one on an SM58. As soon as I started to slide in on it split into 2 pieces. Utter junk	-1
I wasn't able to begin to get this item onto my Shure SM58 without tearing it.  Other reviewers have regarded the tight fit as a feature, but to me it it a big defect.  I take the windscreen on and off as conditions dictate, so I don't want to have a fight on my hands every time I need to make a change.  The picture shows a comparison of a Shure windscreen and this item (note the tear on the right one.	-1
very small	-1
Do NOT use these to polish your guitar. It leaves tons of small fibers all over, and is hard to clean up. A total disaster. These are good for maybe wiping up dog poop, but not cleaning anything.	-1
I wanted this product delivered for Christmas but it was out of stock. Ended up going to the local music shop where I picked up an even more impressive model for almost the same money!	-1
I have always used the Dunlop Mudslide large. I see here that Joe Perry is a little cheaper so I am trying a different one. I play cigar bix guitar and don't need long but large standard size is about $7 more than long. I hate being ripped off but I love porcelain. I reluctantly bought long so i can use it on a standard 6 string. Still the price difference makes me an unhappy customer.	-1
To hard to bend.	-1
I was unable to rate the quality of the pedal because it simply did not work at all right out of the box. Neither battery or adapter power made any difference.	-1
Might work for extremely light weight microphones, but my application involved using it with a wireless mic and it could not keep it in an upright position.  the mic kept dropping down and resulting in several complaints. Will not be buying again or recommending to anyone.	-1
Tore, just trying to get it on top of the microphone. Don't buy.	-1
Cheaply made product, mine was damaged in shipping/handling- shards of glass at damaged areas. Loose mirror pieces at top and bottom where surface is not smooth- no mirror pieces should be glued there as it doesn't stick.	-1
meh its a foam ball for mic what do you expect	-1
If I hadn't damaged the box unpacking it, I'd send it back for a refund. Flimsy, unstable, and unless you're putting something like a small Fender Blues Jr. on it, it'll fall forward on you. This is quite disappointing considering most every other On-Stage item I've purchased over the years has been pretty decent.	-1
Worked great for a month. Felt cheap when I assembled it. One of the arms warped and fell right off. Wasted $$$.  Not sure what stand to get now. Looking, not at this one.	-1
Not even close to worth it. It creates a crazy amount of buzz when used and it destroyed my favorite distortion pedal. Don't chance it, get an adapter that isn't trash quality	-1
Was missing one of the bolt things so I had to run to lowes and get a couple of bolts to put in it. Works great now.	-1
Comes from China. I'm sure it's composed of all kinds of harmful toxins. And it takes over a month to receive it. Kum Pow!	-1
The threads were bad on the gooseneck I received and I will have to return it	-1
Cheap, the end came off the first time I used it. Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for. To much hassle to return	-1
It broke on the first gig.  Very flimsy connection in the middle.  A small child could break this in half with his or her bare hands.	-1
I ordered two of these and both were defective and needed to return.  It created a hissing noise and it required the volume to be turned up more than necessary.  I compared this to an existing converter which had no problems.  Thankfully, Amazon returned these adapters with no problem and refunded me.  I will be looking for another company to purchase these adapters from.	-1
I bought this for a friend of mine along with a Boss DS-1 Distortion Guitar Pedal.  During our first time playing together, he had to switch to running the pedal on battery because using this power supply caused a significant amount of hum.  We tried reversing it in the socket hoping that was the problem and lifting the round on the pedal, but it still hummed.  Not sure what to do about it now.	-1
I got this thought I would use it untill it came and the packaging said there are chemicals in it that cause cancer ..	-1
Used to swear by these until we tried to use it with some gear that needed to pass FCC/CE RF testing. These emit a HUGE amount of RF interference, and there's no way they're FCC/CE tested or approved. Shame on Visual Sound for selling these without bothering to make sure they don't pollute your signal chain.  These supplies (we tested several) were all way over the limit by a huge amount (+35dB, which is more than 3000x the allowed amount). This causes other equipment to pick-up this interference, and any even slightly imperfect metal-to-metal contact will demodulate the noise down into the audio range. That's why people are complaining about these being noisy. They are. Wrapping the entire length of the cable around a huge RF torroidal filter doesn't get rid of the noise, that's how loud they are!  The best thing about these is they put out 1700mA of power, but there are others that beats this with 2000mA of current and don't spew the RF noise.	-1
I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)	-1
This arrived and when I tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some  oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapter.    Instead, these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip, so now I have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck AND a clip.    This is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths...	-1
This product is terrible.  It cannot hold the weight of any microphone over 1 lb, and I would question that, based on your angle of use.  It is terribly made with flimsy construction and I do not recommend its purchase.  Look for a more sturdy built construction gooseneck mic holder.  They are out there, it's just not this one.  Fortunately Amazon was great about their return policy, which I appreciate.  Thank you Amazon for at least having a positive return experience.	-1
This gooseneck is a little too easy to bend and, as a result, starts to correct itself over time. It looks nice but, unfortunately, is only useful when bent only a little.	-1
as mentioned by other reports there is a buzzing sound..as the power supply ages...about 6 months...it becomes a popping sound that gains volume until you have to throw the whole thing away...now searching for a better transformer...finding that most don't put out enough amps...may have to go back to batteries...	-1
I bought this power supply for my OCD full tone distortion Pedal. I quickly ate through a 9 volt battery and decided to get this based on the recommendation from Guitar center. I got home I I plugged in the power supply to the OCD full tone distortion pedal and instantly I heard an added annoying "hum" almost a buzz static sound coming from my tube amp. I tried moving the power supply away from everything else and no luck the "hum" or buzz sound remained. I thought the pedal cost me $127.40 and I didn't buy it to hear "hum" noise. That being said this product does not do what it is supposed to its going back to guitar center! I will buy the voodoo power supply 2 in the next few months.	-1
I purchased these with the hope they would be an improvement on the short goosenecks that came with a recent purchase of Amp-Clamps; a wonderful invention that allows proper micing of almost any guitar amp without using a stand.  Instead, these are really pathetic.  They resemble a gooseneck in appearance only.  They will not hold any shape more extreme than a useless 5 degree bend.  I find it hard to believe a human being actually was involved in quality control of this product.  Utterly worthless for the intended purpose, they will either be returned or thrown away.  I have not been impressed by anything made by On Stage but this product sets a new low.  Save yourself the grief of being suckered into purchasing these.	-1
Nice looking gooseneck, threads are clean, fits well.  However, the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic (Shure SM58) without collapsing.  Better try another brand, or spend a buck or two more to get a better product.	-1
I was completely satisfied with the adapter while it worked. I particularly liked that it didn't take up two spaces in the wall or on the surge protector. It lasted about a year. I guess it's still a bargain at $1.80 or so a month but when it went out, I really needed it not to go out.  I would say that I got maybe 100 uses out of it.	-1
Terrible Design. It kept popping out pf my microphone input. I couldn't use it and had to return it. Will never order again.	-1
Poor quality, the quality of sound significantly diminished when this adapter was used.	-1
Contains stuff known to cali to be dangerous. I'm good. Got it as part of a bundle and won't be using it.	-1
Didn't fit my yeti.	-1
Really cheap guitar, small, thin body. The sound is alright and the neck is easy to play. Needed a complete set up.	-1
I put it on the mic, but then stood about 20 feet away, because I didn't want to catch whatever it gives you, but I couldn't hear anything on the mic, so I don't use it.	-1
D'Addario strings are great...5 stars... However, I saw the price, $6.20, and I'm thinking, "why would anyone pay $6.20 for a single .09 string?"...you'd have to be insane...then, when you look below, at the first review, that reviewer states that he received a 10 pack of single .09 strings, which is certainly very reasonable and more realistic....and all the other reviewers didn't mention anything about the outrageous price or a shortage of strings, so I was led to believe that I would get 10 single strings...yet 1 single string arrived....so it was $6.20 for ONE string!  So I returned it...be careful, the price is a ripoff for one string...	-1
After close inspection and trying to keep it tuned ,noticed a hair line crack in neck, I spent good money on something that can't be used or fixed. I have been in hospital for over a month, that us why I just took it out of box . now what can I do, I am disabled an don't drive that is why i depend on Amazon to purchase what I need to survive. I am about ready to use this guitar as fire wood. Thanks for your time Tommy Mauro	-1
I was COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF by Amazon. This product is a JOKE and it makes me think Amazon is a complete waste of time. I might just part ways with my Prime membership over this one, as a matter of principle. If Amazon can prove it is not intentionally trying to trick people, it has some explaining to do.  I ordered this product because I needed a set of individual 17 gauge strings. Didn't need a full set, just a pack of 17's, which is kind of unusual I realize, but they make them. So that's what I thought I was getting. I never DREAMED I was paying $6.74 for a SINGLE .017 STRING! That is simply OUTRAGEOUS. But that's what happened.  Here is how I was tricked by Amazon:  In the same order, I first purchased a pack of individual 13's for my high E. D'Addario PL013's in a five-pack for a total of $5.30. That's right, 5.30 for FIVE strings of the same guage (013mm), from D'Addoario. Then I looked for a package of 17's to function as my B string. The first result was this product. I didn't pay close enough attention. Surprise. Lesson learned: while the 5 pack of PL013 D'addario strings cost 5.30, the PL017's that came up as the first search result were NOT a pack of 5, but a SINGLE STRING! For over six dollars. The two strings are not appreciably different, mind you, so the price difference is very misleading. The 17 is not wound, which might justify charging a little more (but not that much more). They are both single pieces of wire made from the same material and produced by the same manufacturer. The only difference between them is four one-hundredths of a millimeter.  Due to circumstances beyond my control, I needed to string my guitar too badly to wait for the time it would take to return this $6.74 piece of wire. I had to eat it. One string for the price of a whole pack. Amazon ripped me off. You'd be pretty stupid to buy this if you realized what you were doing.	-1
it is not what i  want.	-1
BUYER BEWARE!!!  If you buy this, you will get one single string for your $5 spent.  You can buy a full set of strings for less.  What I intended to buy was this product, which costs about thirty cents more and contains a quantity of five (5) .012 strings: http://www.amazon.com/DAddario-PL012-5-Guitar-Single-String/dp/B000779T1C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423695404&sr=8-1&keywords=d%27addario+.012+single  I bought this product by mistake, so my fault.  The D'addario strings themselves are excellent and I've been using them for years.  D'addario strings rate 5 stars in my book, but selling a single string for $5 is unacceptable.  I'm rating this product one star in order to get the attention of other people who might make the same mistake I did, and to re-direct them to a better product.  If you're worried about breaking your high E string, it's better to have 5 spares instead of just one, especially for the same price!	-1
pure junk!	-1
I also saw the large picture at the top of the page which plainly says 5 strings are enclosed. Be aware there is only one. I'm surprised Amazon would allow such a deceptive page.	-1
What a serious disappointment . I bought this guitar based on a few very positive YouTube reviews . I don't what guitar that those folks are talking about but it assuredly not the S34C .  Let me start by saying that the guitar looked great right out of the box . Overall the guitar has a nice satin finish . The binding is well done and both the bridge and fretboard seem to be decent quality rosewood . The tuners a sealed , turn smoothly and don't have any wobble .The nut and saddle look like some kind of synthetic bone and both look to be slotted and seated correctly . The neck is slim and feels very comfortable in your hand . The body size is a little smaller and slimmer then a standard dreadnought and sits/hangs nicely while playing either standing or sitting .  Now to the problems . The string action was crazy high right out of the box . Combine that with severe fret buzz at the first three frets makes the guitar unplayable . A closer inspection reveals that the second fret is ridiculously high and needs to be leveled and crowned . I simply can't believe that this guitar was allowed to leave the factory in the condition . I know it's only a $100 guitar but if isn't playable then the discount price doesn't matter . It would taken just a few minutes to run the thing back over to the fretting department and have them fix the bad fret instead of just sending it . Now I'm returning it and Amazon will send it back them . I hope that they fix it before selling it to someone else .  To summarize I would rather have an ugly guitar that plays well as apposed to a nice looking guitar that plays terribly . To give the benefit of the doubt it is possible that I just got a bad one . However the one I got was so bad that I opted for a refund and not replacement . I would recommend exercising caution when buying a S34C .	-1
All these mic protectors are the same. I just did not like the fact that I had to wait this long to receive it.	-1
This is the first foam ball I have purchased that actually comes with a warning that it can cause cancer.  Not sure if this applies across the board for all foam balls, but the warning scared the beejeebies out of me, so it's still in the plastic bag it came from.  I may return them.	-1
The first Ratt distortion pedal I bought in the 80s lasted to 2006. After years of shows and being taken here and there, and moved from home to home, it died after a long hard life of 20 years.  The second one broke after 4 years. Then it was misplaced until I inspected it today. I found that the power supply jack ground terminal had snapped off. The 3rd Ratt distortion pedal I purchased failed right after 2 years of very little use. The 1/4" output jack failed,  fell apart with the threaded metal tube falling off on the outside after separating from itself inside the unit.  The Ratt distortion pedal was built like a tank in the 1980s. But apparently now it is made with inferior parts in places where they need to be made the strongest. I am very disappointed in what seems to be a slide in quality regarding durability, that these pedals used to have.	-1
Gear snobs love these Rat pedals, I don't think they sound good at all.	-1
Just another over rated pedal for the gear snobs..you know they can't play right?	-1
I had high hopes for this pedal.  When it arrived I was shocked to see that it required it's own power supply.  Not good.  It would not accept the female plug that all my other pedals used.  It's power supply was male.  I am not about to buy a separate power supply.  Sorry. So I thought, I may as well check it out with a battery.  After the battery was installed I played with it for about 15 minutes. I found the pedal muddy.  When compared with an Electro Harmonix  Glove pedal that I had, the Rat sounded like crap. I really, really, really wanted this pedal to work for me.  So I am not prejudice toward it in any way.  It just doesn't get there. Save yourself some disappointment and go with another dirt pedal.  Every other dirt pedal I own, and that's about six of them, buries this thing in the, excuse the expression, DIRT!	-1
made the sound of any microphone I used sound like someone threw a blanket over the speaker...muffled and loses articulation.	-1

A strap it's a strap. No big issue. What can you be "picky" about from a guitar strap? - You can choose the material of the strap, in this case, nylon. - The thickness of the strap, in this case, 2". - The color of the strap, in this case, RED?  I bought a product named 'DiMarzio 2" Nylon ClipLock Guitar Strap Black', and it ISN'T BLACK! Is it really hard to see the difference between these two colors? I don't know if it was Sam Ash or Amazon but they're not being careful enough about the orders they receive and, unluckily for me, I live in a country with big delivery services and international currency problems, so using the limited warranty to return the product is out of the question.  Do I hate red? No. Do I hate receiving a product different than what I paid for? ...	-1
For a small cone shape Mic Not for a med or large cylinder shape mic	-1
broke after two uses.	-1
Near one of the attachment points is a low-quality screen print of the D'Addario logo, but there is no text of the D'Addario name. There is nothing about this product that confirms that it is part of the Planet Waves line of products. That's the bad news and the reason for the low mark. The good news is, the price is very reasonable. I've already applied my favorite brand (about $15) of strap locks. I would suggest that any purchaser do the same before trusting this strap with one of their precious basses.	-1
Cheap disposable junk. cable shorted out after 1 month of light use	-1
Serves it purpose, cheap materials.	-1
While it does the job, it also muffles the vocals too much and is not effective for either a stage performance or recording.  A thinner layer of foam would have worked better.	-1
Man these cables are crap... I bought 2 and they both stopped working, now I have to move the hell out of the cable to get sound at some point of the cable, I ended up buying other brand. DON'T BUY	-1
The one I received did not have the pick pocket on it so I think it may have been couterfeit. Yet the strap does not have the pick pocket, nor the typical planet waves emblem on the end, it is padded and works well.  Make sure you use Straplocks to not lose your valuable bass!	-1
Made for a thin mic.  I didn't even notice it said Euro Style, whatever that means. But the description says made for most mics.	-1
Get a Comfort Strapp instead.  You get what you pay for.	-1
Terrible Product. When I tap or lay my hands on the srrings near the PUs, it'll fall silent. Sorta acts like a Noise clamp of sorts. Has to be faulty in my opinion.  I've always gone monster cables & I'll be going back. They have never let me down. This one? First try, First letdown. Same with Mogami. leave all that $$ stuff alone & go with monster.	-1
Either the connectors are too short, or the rubber leading up to them is too thick.  It did not lock properly into any of my guitars.  In fact, it ripped the wiring off of my output jack on one of them.  Fortunately, after reading another review on here, I was able to make this a workable cable by trimming off some of the rubber leading up to the connector.  It locks in perfectly now.  But I shouldn't have to had to modify a 25 dollar cable to make it work.  That's something I would expect from a 10 dollar store brand cable.	-1
As I mentioned in another strap review I'm always on the look out for a great new comfy bass strap. This one seemed pretty good, so I ordered it. Eh...It's ok. It's comfy but nothing special. I did notice it doesn't look as it does in the pic though. Similar but doesn't have the the planet waves logo/pick holder. I paied less than $20 for this. So I'm not returning it lol. I'll most likely will keep it as a backup strap or just give it to someone who needs a decent strap. All in all...I don't really recommend  buying this. But I do recommend Mono Betty Straps :)	-1
I bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a GLS mic and it doesn't fit either.  A little too small.	-1
the plugs are a bit wide and too short to maintain a  solid "locked" connection, especially if you use two or more in adjacent jacks. I'd steer clear of these. They sit on a shelf now... too late to return.	-1
The right angle side pops out of the jack on a guitar or amplifier, making it unusable. Tested several cables in several jacks. These are defective by nature.	-1
bought 2, 1 didn't even last a week before brteaking	-1
I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken, but I didn't want any down time, so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time, and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine, I really wanted to just try out the new cord.  I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar, it falls almost immediately out of place again. So, I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed, unlike this brand new bad cable.	-1
Very disappointed in these strings. Round wound, very twangy. Had bass at luthier and he recommended them, but he said he was disappointed in this set. They look like they are wrapped with bronze, not nickel. Now I know why they were so cheap.	-1
I was buying something else on Amazon and thought I'd grab a set of new strings for my mountain dulcimer at the same time. I'd never bought official 'dulcimer' strings before and was surprised to find what those were. Maybe its just me and the way I play (40+ years), but these are very heavy (thick) strings and I kept having to retune as they kept stretching as I played (I have peg tuners and they did not wind tight). I play a lot and these were just awkward and clunky sounding. After half an hour I put my old ones back on and will keep these as an emergency backup. I only use three strings, and buy the thinnest strings I can find at a guitar store - .008s for 1st and 2nd string, and the thinnest wound string the store has for the 3rd. The wound string I just bought was 3x as thick as what I normally use, and I know it could not be tuned as high as I sometimes go with that string and still be flexible. I fret all three strings and pick, have lots of different tunings I use, and my preferred thin stings have a nice clean sound, lots of range, can bend a note. Can't say that for the new ones, but they were cheap and may serve a purpose some day. I guess the best I can say is - because of all the 'good' reviews - now I know what 'official' dulcimer strings are like, and suppose these will be fine if you like very thick strings. (You should try thin ones though!)	-1
There are issues with these cables or at least the batch that I bought to do 3 pedal boards. I spent over 200 dollars. The tip of the plug was made out of spec "to big (FAT)" and will not work in all pedals, meaning, they will not click and lock in the pedals. boss,MXR, MJM pedals to say a few they won't connect with. I've sent them to Planet Waves with the issue with the cables and I'm still waiting to see what they're going to do. There is some danger to some pedals depending on the input parts used. I'll keep you informed on what planet waves does to fix the problem. They are guarantee for life and btw they're made in china. The warrantee is in very small print and you need a magnifying glass to read it but its there. It is very good low capacitance cable like George L but the plugs like I said are out of spec. We'll see what happens. Again, The tip or ball end of the plug was made over sized and is out of spec.	-1
Meh. The feel was ok. The sound was crap. The bigsby was nice though.	-1
first the strings fell apart(the inside wire came out of the wrapping) and caused me to put a large scratch right on the body of the guitar, then the E string snapped on me. im disappointed	-1
Stick with Ernie Ball.	-1
There's a reason this is less than forty dollars. The unit I received may very well have been defective, but I didn't want to take my chances on another cheap pedal. Might as well just buy a pedal from the people who know how to make pedals (Boss) and be done with it. This unit picked up radio interference, and quite easily overloaded the signal. Not sure if that's the right way to explain it, but with too much distortion or level, it would just cut out, like it was too much. Tried on multiple amps and cables to rule out -- it was the pedal. Even with the levels on very low, it lacked any sort of body like a guitar should have. Not worth it, back it goes.	-1
Boring effect. Does not track well and is fizzy and cheap. Unless you want LoFi or NoFi you do not need this.	-1
It's going back.  Nice heavy extruded Aluminum construction -- but the design has the innards completely open to the environment.  For instance, play a bar where someone knocks over a beer on the stage; say goodbye to your volume pedal.  So it's good-bye to the pedal before that happens.	-1
The product description says this strap is "black leather". However, the tag on the strap says "ECO LEATHER". I've never heard of "eco leather" before, so I looked it up. "Eco leather" is apparently molded from mostly plastic with some vegetable fiber mixed in and sometimes some recycled real leather scrap fiber mixed in. Essentially, what you are buying is a textured plastic. It looks more like plastic than leather, though it is very soft and has a textured finish. Genuine top grain leather mandolin straps are commonly available for a slightly higher price ($23 to $25 compared to the $20 list price for this strap).  As far as this strap goes, the maximum length is 51 inches. It can be shortened by 6 inches through the slots on the main part of the strap. The main strap is 2 inches thick and very soft, so it can comfortably carry various instruments with strap buttons (not just a mandolin).  Personally, for the price, if I was looking for an old-fashioned leather and wood look to my instrument, I would pay a little more for a top grain leather strap.	-1
This thing won't stay in one place, keeps slipping along the strap, and you'll have to keep adjusting. It needs a way to temporarily lock it in one place. The padding is average. I wouldn't buy again.	-1
A big mistake;  I wiped my guitar clean of this glorified Vaseline in a micro-dispenser.  LIve and learn.  Heed this.	-1

Perhaps I didn't use enough or simply have some other issue with my bridge but have not noticed any miracle or angels singing - no ah ha moment	-1
I tried it twice and it seems to deaden my tone.  I applied it to the nut and to the bridge as per the directions.  Played through a clean setting with no pedals and my tone seems affected.  The strings didn't have the same chime as before.  Unless I'm not applying it correctly, I'm not sure I want to try it again.	-1
This pedal has huge issues... it kills your tone and your overall signal power, it's garbage!!! I'm very surprised that Ernie Ball (music gear "Professionals") makes this horrible soung pedal, seriously DON'T BUY THIS PEDAL!!!!  Edit: I did a little research and I found that this kill tone issue is not a new thing... checkout JHS volume pedal Mod  Tone kills https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vB2hWf6fBA  JHS Mod https://www.jhspedals.com/products/mod-shop/ernie-ball-volume  I encorage you do some research before buying this!!	-1
Had to wait a week for them even though they were "prime". D'Addario really drug their feet with processing for ONE pack of strings. When I finally got them they looked and felt great but the D string broke before I even started tuning it up to standard tuning. Now I have three new shiny bright strings and one dingy old one that's dead. I would rate 5 stars had it not been for the dead on arrival string snap.	-1
These are okay, but after purchasing a set of these and a set of Rotosounds for my Hagstrom, the Rotosounds sound better, have more even tension string-to-string, and better low-end response, plus they come packaged in separate envelopes which makes it easier to install without getting the strings mixed up (d'addario packs them all in one bag which they pretend has to do with being green, but it's really just to save money...the plastic doesn't break down anyway and isn't as easily recycled in most areas.	-1
Cheap, cheap, cheap.  You pay for what you get. And $20 buys you Chinese junk. Do not buy this product.	-1
This is a really basic item, but it didn't work out for me as the plugs are slightly different than the plugs on my pedals' factory adapters. I only have a few pedals (Infinity Looper, ISP Decimator, BeatBuddy, MXR 108 EQ) and their factory adapter plugs have little prongs in the center barrel that sort of clamp the center pin in the pedal. It makes for a very solid connection. The 1 Spot connectors don't have the center barrel prongs so while they fit well and work, they sometimes lose connection momentarily with the slightest vibration. Seeing as how I step on my pedals from time to time, the power connections need to be rock solid reliable, and the 1 Spot connectors are not.	-1
These are not designed to fit a 301/4 scale bass. They were short on the small diameter size by about an inch. Therefore, the strings buzzed at the first fret because the diameter was too small at the nut. Don't buy them, I wasted $16.00	-1
The headphones are really good however... if you have such weak cables that make me have to throw them out, they are less than "okay". They broke right near the headphone and I saw that they were near breaking on the other end as well.  For such expensive headphones, you would think that using a better quality cable with a cloth weave similar to a guitar patch cord would make these last much longer.  Not impressed.  Looking at another brand.  I have Sennheiser head phones that I bought in 1981 that are still going strong yet these.... are now in the garbage.	-1
I started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked, but when I tried to add a second/third stomp box, I couldn't get any guitar sound only a loud buzz. I returned this product I did further testing, I would not recommend it to anyone. With my personal experience in mind, I would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply. hope this helps	-1
If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a Guitar > Volume Pedal > Amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a POORLY engineered pedal.  It can't be "true bypass" as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward.  Anyway, the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable.  The tone becomes duller, the output drops.  I would expect that from an Asian knock-off, not from an A-list gear maker.  I might be over-stating Ernie Ball's reputation, though they make some fine guitars I gotta say, and I've used their strings for many years.  If you plan to use this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine.  This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker.  The signal processing takes place in the unit, not the pedal.  (Those units have their own tone problems but that's another review.)  It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT "true bypass" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal.  I will need to try that out, but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility.  Major FAIL on their part.  2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple "first do no harm" principle. It harms your tone.  How dumb is that?  The pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though I have my doubts about their "string" mechanism over time.  The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.  I have no recommendations for a volume pedal.  Because of the feel, and esthetics, I do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver.	-1

D'Addario XL and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad strings! I've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings. I thought I'd buy these "cheap" strings for practice, and use a higher end (NYXL) for gigs. Whoa, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether. There's a reason they're cheap, and I'm thoroughly convinced now it's because they're made of the cheapest material known to mankind. After about an hour's worth of use, these things are absolutely toneless. These XL strings, after an hour of playing, sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending, slashing, and strumming. Straight up, the XL is garbage. Period.	-1
I've played EXL110 for years and loved them, using hundreds of sets, but I think something most have changed with the production.  I've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month.  All three were on gigs and now I'm stressed a set won't even make it through a whole show.  Come on D'Addario.	-1
I got this preamp because I heard I needed a preamp as well as phantom power for an AKG studio condenser mic that I was also purchasing; and that it would also "warm up" the sound a bit. That might help for cheap mics but there was absolutely no voice quality difference with 2 mid-range mics under diff recording tests than straight to an Mbox 2 mini. As a matter of fact, I got a little extra noise. (but that is prob due to the extra cable connection) I can't say what it will do for instruments, but for voice, it is totally not necessary if you have a good mic and interface. If not, then you probably need something like this.  Things I liked: Solid metal build, 2 kinds of jacks, price. Things I hated: Gets very hot doing nothing, No on/off switch (you have to unplug it from the back each time)  Although this preamp may work just swell, those last 2 hated points were enough for me to give it 2 stars.	-1
I needed to replace poorly built, wobbly and ugly green Wilkinson tuners on my Vintage V100PGM ICON Lemon Drop Greeny guitar.  These tuners require 10mm holes in the headstock. Mine had 9mm holes. The description on Amazon didn't say that. Also, the color on these tuners are dull green and not cream like in the picture. I returned them to Amazon.	-1
Not as high quality as one our church has from 15+ years ago.  Noticeable difference in sound and ruggedness.  Still better than some of the cheaper boxes available today, though, but for high quality shoot for a Radial, Countryman or Whirlwind.	-1
I bought this as the smallest solution I could find to run keyboards into an input block that provided only XLRs.   I didn't want to have a stack of Whirlwind Directors (which I was using live, already had, and have been absolute rocks - but are big), I did not want to commit any of my new Radial DIs from my studio to this situation (I just didn't need that robust a feature set live).  For this application, a rack DI (either the quad Whirlwind rack or the Radial  solution (which I also have in my studio) was inappropriate and would've caused more trouble than the large individuals.  I really wanted the smallest DI I could find and had good luck with RAPCO in the past as a utility players.  I take care of my gear, so I figured even with modest build quality, I'd be ok. I was wrong.  (Regarding features) The live system in which I used the DBBLOX (I bought 4, one for each mono keyboard) is built around consistent balanced stage power, and everything is properly grounded, so I had no issue with the lack of a ground switch.  Monitors are handled at the console and I have no amp on stage, so, I didn't need 1/4" thrus.  My issue with the DBBLOX is that after 2 years, only 1 out of 4 are "as purchased".  3/4 have needed repair.  Two broke in the same spot (the XLR side, when unplugging/plugging a cable, broke and caused a disconnect to the transformer.  The other, the innards just became loose requiring attention to prevent further breakage/damage.  products with their components rattling around inside are, of course. a concern when you rely on them to get your instrument to the main PA. I have been able to fix them, but, it's still a bad design if 2 out of 4 have required surgery, and 1 was preventatively operated on.  Even after repair, I have taken them  out of service,  As mentioned at the top, I typically buy either proven rock solid live utility pieces or high end studio pieces, so this experiment was, I suppose, a failure,  All DBBLOX have all been replaced by the Whirlwind DI's I already had.  Even though their size still makes things cumbersome, I am confident that they will work on each gig.	-1
The absolute WORST strings Ive ever put on... JUST JUNK... Cold sticky steel feel... This probably puts DAadario on my - IT'S OVER LIST.. They've steadily been going down hill.... They changed suppliers.... there new strings pretty much suck badly....  DO NOT BUY THESE...	-1
They were dead in one hour.	-1
Ernie Ball E strings are literally the worst. Very prone to breaking even upon first time being tightened.	-1
While restringing my Fender F65 acoustic guitar, the E 6th string popped. Nearly cut me. I would like a replacement for it. I never had a problem with D'Addario strings ever.	-1
The Ernie Balls, especially these plain sets, unravel on me when you use them the first time of tuning up. It has happened to me over and over again. It is the way they are finished at the ends. This has been happening to me whether I buy them through Amazon or the Guitar Center. They start slipping and detuning and eventually pull out or break. They also break easily if they don't have the unravelling problem. This will happen one or two times a six-pack. It also happens on regular sets. I won't buy Ernie Balls anymore.	-1
Through my Ampeg bass amp, the low E string gets distorted when you push the bass control above 7, and the upper 3 strings sound kind of plain.	-1
I've used these strings for the past 2 years and they usually last for ever. I purchased 4 sets from Amazon a couple of months ago and they are faulty, the 2W snapped on 3 of the sets when fitting, not good. I'll stick to Guitar Center in the future! Awesome strings, watch were you buy them from!	-1
e string was a dud right out of the package. String are already corroding.	-1
D'Addario strings would be great if it weren't for the fact that about half of their sets of strings have a dud string in them. I've found this to be true in their violin strings, mandolin strings, banjo strings and guitar strings. The strings that don't show up dead sound amazing but there's about a 50/50 chance you'll get a set with a dud string.	-1
I am really getting disappointed with these strings I never had a problem. My Hi E strings are breaking in the middle (between tuners and nut) not at a stress or contact point and (2) strings in the last week have come unraveled down at the bridge end, one on a ES335 the other on a Telecaster with a Babicz bridge, the string doesn't even have a turn in that bridge. I regularly bend a whole step not much more. I'm going to contact the company about this and I don't think these are imitations I have checked the bar code for that. none else having this issue? I had a B string break for no reason too.	-1
Some of my strings weren't fully wrapped, which in turn ruins the playability ofba guitar. Nonetheless, I got what I paid for. Dissapointed in quality, however.	-1
Ordered from Eat My Beats, Inc. I must have a deffective set or something because I did get a refund after it. I put my bass strings on just enough to where I don't need to hold them on and my bottom string just snapped. I have never had that happen before and will not buy these gauges again from this brand.	-1
Compression/sustain wise, this unit is decent but I cannot abide the noise ... I tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor ...	-1
Too thick for drop D it is just in comfortable. Even in drop c they feel way too chunky.	-1
I've been using DR Phospher Bronze strings on my acoustic guitars for at least 10 years, and decided I'd switch it up this time and try something different. I know how to string a guitar and have done it hundreds of times, with no issues ever. This time though, while tuning the guitar after stringing it, the G string broke. Otherwise the strings sound OK, kind of flat really. But without having them all on there, and not getting a chance to settle in, it's hard to say. Maybe don't buy these. Maybe think about another brand. Like I said, I prefer the DR strings. But I don't work for them or anything, not being paid! I swear!! Um. but, yeah. Buy some other strings. These Blue Steel strings really gave me the BLUES. LOL!!	-1
When you ask people 'what are the best strings' they will always tell you to try different strings and decide for yourself. This is the first set I've tried that I'll be switching out immediately.  I played the extra lights when I first started learning and I know they are not the best sounds but I wanted to give my fingers a break since I have not been playing as much around the holidays but when someone in the house commented my guitar did not sound 'right' I knew it was even worse than I thought.  The color coding on these is also weird but that's minor since I know what size strings should go where.  I bought 3 sets in different weights so I'll try them all but I'll stick to the Martin x-lites in the future.	-1
Quite dull... No life to them.	-1
broke the b string when just moderately stretching after installing on guitar. not a big fan of the sound either. prefer D'Addario or martin.	-1
They changed the length of the string by shortening them by a fraction of an inch and they barely fit on my nut. This last set actually routed out a groove out of my nut causing my string to buzz terribly while playing. I had to buy a new nut and change the scale of my strings after 6 years of no problems. and 3 different basses.	-1
I guess the size (length) of the strings have made the strings not as bright sounding and they go dead faster. I have played on them for a couple hours for exactly 4 days and they are dead. WIth the previous D'Addarios, I could play for almost a month. straight.	-1
I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar, and will soon replace them.  On quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected, but it looks bad.  On sound, these seemed okay at first, but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and E steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck, more so than other sets I have used.  Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball.	-1
I don't get how customers accept these poorly built products. This case seems to be the only one available for the thunderbird bass. So, Epiphone has the market cornered. The body cavity of the case fits The guitar well However, the fur lining is not glued or adhered securely to the foam. String trails of glue all around the edge of the lid, loose or poorly installed Skid knobs and chunks of sawdust under the "tolex" outer covering indicate the awful construction of this case. Such a shame because the guitar was finished so well, with attention to detail. If you really like this guitar, Save the $89+ dollars and buy a SKB.	-1
I love D'Addario Pro Arte in general, but these light tension strings killed my guitar sound, and the guitar was not a lot more playable.  However, this is completely dependent on the specific guitar, so please don't let this keep you from TRYING this set.  It was worth the money just to try them out.  By far the best set for me are the regular tension ones with black nylon trebles, LOVE THEM.	-1
No thimbles on the strings. Not what I expected.	-1
Strings a picky thing for most musicians. I myself am a picky guy when it comes to my guitar strings. I wasn't a huge fan of these strings. They took a considerable more amount of time then other brands to get settled into staying in tune. I also thought that the higher strings didn't really have a nice clear tone to them they overall felt dull and flat sounding to me. If thats what you are going for these strings are for you. But in my cause I like my higher end strings to be bright and clear.	-1
sound sucks	-1
Sadly, these strings were suggested as replacements for a Yamaha Guitalele GL-1. They are not compatible. They are gauged E-e, rather than A-a, and will not fit on the bridge or nut. I am giving it two stars because I can use two of the strings to replace the middle. Overall, I am disappointed that these would be suggested, but I guess Im the big dummy that wasn't aware and didn't do my due diligence while trusted the recommendation. If anyone has replaced ALL of the stings on their GL-1, please let me know what you used. Thank you.	-1
I realized a problem with these ... and other review sites will tell you the same. They do nothing for the neck of your guitar because they seal the moist sponge on the inside of your guitar body. It is worth your while to check out a type that does not seal the sound hole, held between a couple of the strings, etc. Some have said that, because they seal the soundhole, these are better suited for a guitar you keep out of its case, but again, if your air is dry enough to need one (40 to 50% Relative Humidity is the recommended range for acoustic guitars), then your neck will still get no benefit. NOTE on the harder plastic ring that some complain about - you NEED that to be resting on the TOP of the guitar around the soundhole - it separates the softer flexible plastic from your guitar's finish - to prevent damage to your finish.	-1
OK, but a little difficult to put in the guitar.  I think other methods to humidify a guitar may be better.	-1
Seems to humidify fine, but the design could be better. I followed instructions carefully and it still scuffed up my guitar around the sound hole. Would not recommend. DO NOT USE ON A QUALITY INSTRUMENT - you'll be sorry like I am.	-1
Strings 5 and 6 (b and high e) broke as I was putting them on, not as good as the EXL 140s. unfortunately cant afford to buy a new pack to restring my PXD void 1.	-1
Bought these because they were $5 at a local retailer, compared to the other nylon sets running $12-17. Thought I would see if I could tell the difference and did not expect to.  These do stay in tune, but that's about all I can say for them. I bought them to replace a dead set of strings, but these sounded even deader right out of the package.	-1
Sound good but won't stay in tune. It's frustrating!	-1
I played these strings for like three months and still don't sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I've also been watching all his old interviews on YouTube and not once does he admit to the fact that he would have been nothing without this particular gauge of strings.  Nor does he cop to the fact that he used a plain 20 for the G string.  I am not impressed.  I will never play 13s again until I hear an official apology from his estate.  Music used to mean something, man.	-1
I put this on a guitar I have owned for 40 years. I am ready to take them off as they fail to hold their tune.  Even after continuous tuning for a month they are out after  5 minutes. Dont bother with these.	-1
After around 10 years of using these, I am finally switching to a different brand. The last 4 3set packs I have purchased came with at least 1 string deffective. Waste of time and money. Sometimes you can tell the string is deffective right away, but other times it takes a few strummings. This last one started to de-tune by itself brand new.	-1
not happy ...	-1
I bought a set of classical (nylon) guitar strings a couple of months ago. They were labeled as "student" strings. I received them promptly, and they were so good that I ordered another set over a month ago, but they never arrived. So, I can't rate them. But the service actually gets no stars. They kept my money! (1 cent!)	-1
The first two sets of strings were fine, loved them. Just opened the third pack and found they'd left out the 1st and 2nd (E & B) strings. Bought them long enough ago that I can't ask for a refund - which I wouldn't ask for since I already used two sets. But I do think they should send me my other two strings.	-1
I was not happy with the sound of these strings. The EAD steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon GBE strings sound tinny. For an extra $2 I bought the D'Addario EJ45 Pro Arte and got a much, much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old Yamaha G-60.  Spend the extra $2 its well worth it.	-1
The coating comes off where the pick hits the strings as well as the frets.  This is not worth the extra price.  I am unhappy with this particular product, but overall I really like DR strings.	-1
They're probably fine for standard 7 string tuning. However, on my Ibanez RG7 string they're incredibly loose and wobbly even when tuned down a half-step from standard. Bottom line if you're playing in anything other than standard don't even bother. Personally I don't even really like these anyway but they are not the worst strings for the price.	-1
I bought these in my ongoing search for a good coated string that would both sound good and last. I thought that these, being black, and my Strat being dark grey and black from headstock to strap button, would also look good on my guitar.  Well, one out of three. They do look good. But they don't sound good. Actually I don't know if they'll last, because I'm getting them off the guitar.  The purpose of a coated string is longer lasting good tone. Not longer lasting metal. So if a coated string starts out sounding dull and, frankly, like a worn out uncoated string, who cares if in some other sensecorrosion resistance, e.g.it lasts longer than an uncoated string? These sounded worn out when I strung them up.  The sound of these strings is utterly lacking in highs--in fact, as I was playing some bass riff on them, I suddenly understood--they sound like a guitar bass string. They have no highs at all. That nice new string sparkle is totally absent, and riffs played on the bass strings sound more like one of those old Fender six-string guitar basses.  In addition, the plain strings, G, B, and E, feel terrible. They look great--but it's like playing painted strings. (That may be literally what they are.) They feel tacky (as in grippy, not in bad taste) and bumpy--not slick and smooth like an unwound string should.	-1
I was very disappointed in this harmonica. It came in damaged and the company was not helpful at all.	-1
I ended up putting my uncoated strings back on. These will go dead just sitting on the instrument. I can boil them to bring them back to life but it is too much work.	-1
I've used several strings before, D'Addario, Martin, Ernie Ball, Elixer, GHS, etc. And these are by FAR my LEAST favorite, I despise them, they look cool but aside from they they're awful, out of the box they are as dead as a door nail, ignore the novelty of coated strings and just by some Elixir or Ernie Ball, they're much better strings than this garbage, absolutely terrible.	-1
Yeah, so after breaking 6 Ernie Ball high e strings in a row on my Parker Fly AND Parker NiteFly SA I ordered Electro Harmonix and broke that one too, then I ordered these with the reinforced ball ends- to discover that YOU GAVE ME TWO LOW E STRINGS AND NO A STRING IN THIS  PACKAGE.  Thanks, so so much for that.  So far the D'Addarios are the only strings that have not broken instantly.  You guys in the string business seriously need to get it together.  I think I'm in over one hundred bucks on stringing these two guitars and it has been some kind of surreal nightmare.	-1
Counterfeit!!!  Internal packages clearly state "Made in USA", overwrap has "Made in China" barcode sticker, and D'Addario states string code has already been registered.  Reported to D'Addario and Amazon!	-1
Questionable quality at best... or just plain junk. These are the worst I have seen in fifty years of playing. The top E was coming apart as I was putting it on, and the bottom E never got above Db before popping. It is a shame, they use to be good strings.  I just checked the D'Addario web site to make sure the strings were not counterfeit... turns out they are real... just not very good.	-1
I bought these strings to use for my 6 string to tune to drop B ..what I got was no 54 gauge string and 2 extra light strings !!! So I was disappointed ..won't buy again	-1
Counterfeit! purchased through 8th street music-lower case.	-1
Not that great.  Not very bright or full sounding.  "Normal" tension of this brand is a tad better in terms of how they feel to play but that may just be my personal taste and not the strings.  There is nothing special about these at all.  They take a long time to stretch enough that you have any tuning stability, more than Augustine or Savarez strings.  I would use these if I had no other option but otherwise I won't buy them again.	-1
they don't have a "stopper" at the end.	-1
Not the best strings.	-1
I recently purchased these strings twice within the same month. The first set's G string popped while I was tuning from Drop C to E standard as slow as possible and almost immediately after I started winding it popped. Then my high e string popped while loosening it from E Standard to Drop C. The second set I bought five days ago and when I set it up in E Standard and it played perfectly fine then I tuned it to Drop C; everything fine. Suddenly while starting to tune back to E Standard not even turning the peg a quarter of the way "snap!"  it broke. I do not recommend these strinags, particularly for their inability to be tuned back and/or forth, even slowly without breaking. For this reason I recommend Ernie Ball or Fender strings. The only positive thing I have to say about these strings is the bright, clear, soft tone along with their great ability to stay in tuning once tuned better than some brands such as Ernie Ball.	-1
Got these for my kids guitar thinking they'd be easy on his fingers.  They're too thin.  They barely register on the pickups, presumably no enough mass to get a good response.  They also go sharp way too easy if you play chords.  Switched to 9's.  These are horrible.	-1
2 strings broke while stretching them and can't get hold of D'Addario on their website!!! A little upset!!!!!!;;!;	-1
Amazing at first but after not playing for 3 weeks in my case they got rusted really bad...might go back to elixirs or other strings that won't rust as fast.	-1
Some say that this will fix all of your G String issues on a LesPaul type of guitar (I have a Gretsch Pro Jet). While this is true, it will also kill the tone of the guitar. I am not sure why, but this one string made a large impact on the tone of my guitar and I felt like I was playing a very dull guitar with almost no high end capabilities. This was a deal breaker for me since this made the guitar's high end (which is already the weak link on any LesPaul type guitars) even worse.  I would only recommend these string to someone who plays jazz and similar styles and has a tuning issue. Ohterwise I would say they take away more than they give.  In short, while it may fix the tuning issues with the G string it will also affect your tone negatively.	-1
Use to be a fan but the bottle stopped functioning a few days in making it useless	-1
really wanted to love this one. it was $180, and the look is just awesome. but, in studio and on stage, i am pretty disappointed and here is why...  other amazon reviews suggested that it is pretty good about plosives / pops, but it's really not. even in the video demonstration one of the top reviews posted here, you can hear it popping almost immediately.  as for live settings - with any sort of louder rock band - it picks up a lot of the drums, no matter where you're standing. it seems to get excited by the highs of cymbals in a way that it doesn't for just your voice. it's also not super directional, so you really have to eat it on stage.  i also don't recommend it for anyone using any vocal processing (compressor, delay) unless you are using in-ear monitors. this thing feeds back way too easily.  after giving up on it, i went for a completely uncool looking mic - the EV 967 - which has brighter highs, deeper lows, an all around more "studio" sound on stage - and seems to pick up my voice and only my voice, even when i'm right next to my drummer.  the Super Deluxe 55 seems to be much better about anti-feedback and side rejection. might be worth the extra money if the style is super important to you. but remember that while you are committing to this look, you are buying a microphone that you NEED to be RIGHT AGAINST to pick up properly, covering a huge chunk of your face in an unflattering way.  PS i kinda hate that this is labeled "The Elvis Microphone", but i guess that's what it is.	-1
Hi! I clearly remember buying a set of 10 normal light strings D'Addario (10-46). And i just received one set of strings. I mean ... apparently you made a mistake. you sent me a package of one set of strings, when in fact buy the set of 10. I really need to solve my problem because i want to keep my instrument working. I hope you can help me to give my opinion on the matter.  Thanks in advance for your attention...	-1
I wanted to like this sooo much but the awesome asthetics just don't make up for the crappy fidelity... there's one spot where you have to sing into it to get anything that sounds decent ... even then the Beta 58 blows it away... not even close	-1
What has happened to the quality of these strings?  I have been using hem for years and they have been great.  On The last set of them I had two strings snap while my guitar was sitting on it's stand and when I got the new set the 5th string was unraveling out of the package. And I can't get these suckers to stay tuned. What's up? I'm done buying this brand and will not recommend them to anyone. Now, to find better strings!	-1
4 of the strings snapped Two high E's Two B's	-1
one of the sets of strings was NOT classical, it was acoustic. (all metal strings) somebody messed up at the factory.	-1
in the old days, we used tobe able to buy all 6 NYLON clear strings.... now tis almost impossible....  with these strings on even a cheap or semi decent classic geeetar.... one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings... very nice, resonant, and clean...not shrill but what is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to be bass strings i don't know...  Again, like someone else NOTED the OBVIOUS>>>>>  sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is GIGANTIC.  This makes the move from the D to the G string too noticable  CANT THEY EVEN MAKE  6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even ? makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally...sucks bad now. ooh thanks man	-1
Foggers beware...this makes your juice smell GREAT, HOWEVER if you leave it in your systems heater, or anywhere, for a while, and you turn it back on, the Scent will BURN and make a HORRIBLE Smell that is gaurentee to make you feel weezy!!!! Definitely do not buy unless your using the entire bottle in ONE show	-1
Two strings broke before I ever got to play on them. I love D'Addario, which is why it makes me sad to only give them one star. I wouldn't be surprised to find out these are fakes, because this is not the D'Addario quality standard I know and love.	-1
I bought a set of 10 of these strings.  They sound great.  However, I keep breaking the D string at the saddle even though I file off any rough edges.  I thought it was the guitar, so I borrowed my friends guitar and put a set on that guitar.  Broke the D string within a week.  I replaced all the strings again.  Broke the D string within one day in the middle of a gig.  Very frustrating.  I'm going to switch brands.	-1
I got this in hopes it would help with the smell that is associated with Fog, it made no difference at all as I could tell.	-1
The Fog Juice Scent is a total waste of money. Fog Juice Scent when you open the tiny tiny bottle smells like water or rather nothing When you pour it in your fog machine it makes absolutely ZERO difference. I was hoping the heat from the fogger would activate the smells, but nothing. I have an Eliminator 1000 Fog Machine, it works amazing with or without the useless Fog Juice Scent I am amazed that Amazon allows this product to be sold. I don't think they have tried it out. I have smelled really good fog at nightclubs but this is not the product you seek.	-1
Was pretty fast shipping but the strings make a strange sound. When you play you can hear an extra sound that shouldn't be there.	-1
I've been using daddario for over a decade and I got really disappointed. the first set I opened was okay, but the second featured a very prolongued coating defect. I don't intend to return the whole package because I'm not living in the US now. but I definitely won't buy another.	-1
when I was young 12's were good .....at 70 not anymore	-1
I know about expansion and contraction and take good care of my little GS171 YAMAHA flamenco,(well kept humidity level room and away from sunlight too) I have been disappointed with these strings, They must have a very short shelf life compared to other brands. Over a period of three years using at least three three set boxes.. I experienced that every replacement set , one of the low silverplated strings will break /pop/snap on the guitar on it's own just sitting on the stand. I own many acoustics and electrics and playing  for decades, no set a strings break this fast.  I would not recommend these after having this problem for at least six sets of three packed strings over the past few years.	-1
Arrived quick. I was dissatisfied with guitar quality.	-1
ok	-1
I purchased this reed replacement set for my Lee Oscar D and immediately discovered that the reeds are not checked before shipping. I guess it's time to go back to playing the Hohner Special 20's. Even after cleaning and checking the edges these reeds are thin sounding and not as bright as what you would find on a brand new Lee Oscar Harmonica.	-1
i don't know if i just got a dud but, i went through 3 high e strings in 3 days. the first one snapped before it could get to e, the second one snapped while loosening the string (seriously!?). and the third one just snapped while sitting in high e.	-1
I have six guitars that I need to keep fresh strings on, and I thought I was getting a deal here, but I was extremely disappointed when these strings lost their punch almost immediately. I usually can count on D'Adario for a good, long lasting clean sound, but these guys just deadened out so quickly that I'll be going back to Ernie's from now on.	-1
Sound is great but quickly fades with corrosion.	-1
They are acceptable but too much on the bright side for me. I much prefer the exp11 strings. I will not be buying these again.	-1
nunca llegaron a mis manos	-1
poured a whole bottle in fogger, barely could smell vanilla	-1
The one I received has a PLASTIC adjustment collar, NOT die-cast or anything resembling metal . . . . so of course it strips out easily and will no longer hold height adjustments.  I have had success with other 'On Stage' products, but this is crap I would not recommend.	-1
Sounds ok, durability really sucks... Just buy when there's not Elixir or Earnie Ball available.	-1
Be careful for the quality. I get 3 packs and missing 1 string(5th)	-1
The worst, low quality strings I have ever used in over 3 decades of playing the guitar. I've used several different strings in my lifetime, from GHS Boomers to Fender Bullets, to my only true love, Ernie Ball Super Slinky's, and I have to say these are the absolute worst strings I've ever played... here is why... They NEVER stay in tune on any guitar I own (and I've tried themon several, from ESPs to Gibsons, to USA Fenders). I am CONSTANTLY tuning these POS strings. One chord after tuning and the whole guitar needs to be re-tuned. Next, they stay bright for about 2 hours. These are some of the deadest feeling/sounding strings I have ever played. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and I really do not know why so many people love these so much. I thikn it's because they are cheap and marketed well. Sadly, like I said... to me, worst string ever made. Makes sense I was buying these 10 packs for like $16.	-1
Bulky and not very flexible in use. Takes a lot of table space that is hard to come by for most musicians.	-1
I decided to get this because I have 14 guitars and buying strings can get expensive. Plus these are the strings I prefer anyways. Had high hopes for it but even looking at the picture I thought "I wonder how they get the strings to not bind up inside?". The answer? They didn't. First string I went to grab was the low E. I followed the instructions and held the rest of the strings in place while pulling and it got stuck. Pulled as hard as I could without risking damage to the string and it would only come out about 6 inches...and then it wouldn't go back in. I tried another string, same thing. I now had 2 low E strings sticking out 6 inches from the box. I had no choice but to open the box up all the way, take apart the plastic spools inside, unwind ALL of the low E strings, and then try to wrap them back up again. The result? I now have 25 brand new low E strings with finger prints all over them. Thought my problems were over once I finished with the 3 wound strings. Nope. Sure enough went to grab a G and it got stuck. Took some serious coaxing to get it out. I would rather pay the extra money for 25 individual sets of these strings than ever get this bulk box again. They didn't even wrap each bundle of strings in protective sleeves either so by the time I use the last few sets they will probably be corroded and useless. Especially the low E's thanks to my prints. Basically what I'm saying is unless you are a guitar repair tech and plan on changing 25 sets of strings in one week do NOT buy this. Waste of money.	-1
Do not buy these strings for an Extended Range Guitar.  I have a 28.625 inch scale on my Agile 8 string and the lowest string (the 74), turns into a 50 before it reaches the nut.  Ernie Ball 8 string slinkies have the exact same problem.  The only manufacturer who doesn't skimp on winding the whole string seems to be DR for their Tite Fit Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes strings.	-1
If you expect to get what you pay for, prepare to be disappointed. Sounds weak. Sounds old. Sounds worn. Sounds dull. I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster. I can afford to pay twice as much. But I am going to keep using my D'adario Strings from now on. I am so disappointed. These strings are for the "campfire guitarist" not the aggressive picking thrilling, tapping, pull offs, or sweepers. If you are a tone fanatic keep looking. If your guitar deserves the best, do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. Respect your GUITAR.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are made from China.	-1
I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret.	-1
do not buy this pack if you're expecting a 3 sets of strings. what arrived was a single set (6 strings). unfortunately I was in a position where i needed them right away and had to go ahead and slap them on the guitar.	-1
this is a first time for me I ordered two packs of these string and both of the #12 strings broke at the ball when I put them on ?	-1
I kept these on for about a week and switched to dunlop heavy core. They don't handle down tuning very well and they have a odd metal (not the music style) sound to them.	-1
I bought a set of 3 regular light gauge (.10) strings.  When I went to install the low E string, it must have been defective, because there was hardly any tension on the string I was winding when it broke just before the saddle.  I have included a picture of the break as a customer picture.  I was able to replace it with the low E string from the next set, however I'm still out a set of strings.  It isn't worth the hassle to return the pack, so I'm keeping them, but this'll probably be the last time I purchase from this brand.	-1
i love ernie ball slinkys  so i thought i would try these big mistake i changed out the john pearse 80/20 bronze strings i had on my guitar and i regret it immensely. these strings sounded pretty thin and lacked the tone i had with the afore mentioned strings. of course your guitar might sound great with them .	-1
It was not as described in the website. I used it for one day and the strings were already corroded. Don't buy it if you are looking for a corrosion resistant set.	-1
Not very impressed poorly threaded, ordered 2 one of them was not even threaded where the stand goes into the holder, got it jammed in there. Move on to something a little better this is junk.	-1
Works great. However on mine, the threads on the pipe were too deep and the pipe actually went beyond the bottom of the base when screwed in completely. It was easy enough to fix with a hacksaw, but it really shouldn't have been necessary. I'm guessing this isn't a common issue since I don't see other complaints about it.  Otherwise it's fine. There are rubber feet on the base to protect the surface it's on. It's heavy enough to feel sturdy. The stickers people complain about came off easily and completely with some water, soap, and magic eraser. It fits standard microphone threads.  Having to saw off part of it means it looses 2 stars. Otherwise it would be 4 stars	-1
D'Addario XL and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad strings! I've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings. I thought I'd buy these "cheap" strings for practice, and use a higher end (NYXL) for gigs. Whoa, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether. There's a reason they're cheap, and I'm thoroughly convinced now it's because they're made of the cheapest material known to mankind. After about an hour's worth of use, these things are absolutely toneless. These XL strings, after an hour of playing, sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending, slashing, and strumming. Straight up, the XL is garbage. Period.	-1
I've played EXL110 for years and loved them, using hundreds of sets, but I think something most have changed with the production.  I've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month.  All three were on gigs and now I'm stressed a set won't even make it through a whole show.  Come on D'Addario.	-1
Zager strings are my choice over any other I have tried.  Zager.com	-1
I've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go "flat" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster.	-1
Let me start off by saying 2 things...  One, i usually don't write negative reviews.. this one is important though because this product has taken away my favorite hobby for over a month now...  Two, that in not an amateur player and have been around guitars quite a bit in my life so I know what I'm doing with guitars...  I've played and used MANY different brands and types of strings and until now my two "go to" brands for good strings at a decent price were DR & D'Addario (Thomastic Infeld's are the best IMHO, but they fall well outside of the "decent price" genre...)  Anyway, About a month ago I needed some strings and since I had heard of the new BT sets from D'Addario I thought I'd give em' a shot....  I've regretted it ever since.... (I ordered the  EXL120BT's)  To the point.....  I install the strings, stretch them a little afterwards, tune em, clean/polish everything, spray a small coat of Fingerease and let it dry, etc...  My standard string install method I've used a 100x over or more with no problems or no noticeable issues...  Then i start to playing....  (biggest mistake I've made this year so far)....  Around 2 minutes into playing on the new strings (I use a few Gilmour solos to stretch the strings out after I install a set) I notice that my fingers on my left hand are REALLY starting to hurt, (especially my ring finger)....  When I stop and take a look at my fingers, I can see little tiny "fine hair" like metal splinters ALL OVER each finger, and a few of the larger normal sized splinters most of us have seen from time to time...  Some are really small and difficult to see without a magnifying glass, and, others are your standard metal shard, but ALL hurt like %#!$@!!!!  ESPECIALLY when you touch anything with those fingers... (You know, like a guitar fretboard for instance)  Fast forward to today....  And I SWEAR that I am not exaggerating....  I have not been able to play guitar since this happened due to the pain in my fingers, and I have pulled no less than 30 metal splinters from my middle, pointer and pinky finger on my left hand combined.... (I have finally gotten them all out as of about a week ago, which is around 3 weeks after the "incident")  As for my ring finger, the last count on it was 63 metal splinters (most being the little fine hair-like ones that are difficult to see without a good magnifying glass and get out without precision tweezers, but feel like knife wounds when you touch a hard object) that I have removed...  There are still several in this finger of the larger type and are so deep that I am unable to get to them so far..  I'm going to have to visit a doctor for these most likely...  Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another thing this company makes...  If you had gone through what I have (and still am), I can assure you that you'd be there with me...  Worst experience in my life with a product..  If I was the lawsuit type, they would have one....  (& if this doesn't end soon, they may still)  BUYER BEWARE.....  Don't say you weren't warned....	-1
CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again	-1
They are not the string of a couple years back... they changed something or cheap'in the string.... less copper maybe. I don't know but they lack volume, a little muffled.	-1
I purchased a classic microphone. From my knowledge my mic and this stand should be standard but they do not fit together. I tried my mic in a standard mic stand and it works perfect. So I guess I am going to say it is the fault of this stand.	-1
I don't know what the problem is. I just went through 2 high E strings in less than a month. I ordered this pack and gave a set to my friend. I kept 2 for my self thinking they would last me,but the high E quickly broke off...the first time could've been my fault I guess, I was trying to stretch the string out but it broke off. the second time I was just retuning. since I do do that a lot. I go from standard sometimes all the way down to B..As I was dropping the string, it just broke off. i've used nothing but Ernie Ball slinky's since I first began playing guitar and those are the strings that i've pretty much stuck to. They have never broken this quickly ever.  I don't know if it's the quality of the d'addario's or my guitar has some bridge issues.. But I have never had strings break off on me so easily...Since Amazon is only offering Slinky's as add on items I went with these even though I had never used a set ....Maybe I was wrong to try a different brand I had never used..  UPDATE: I was contacted by the company and they were able to solve my issue. I think I may have gotten some old sets,i'm not quite sure,but the year on the box was 2007,i'm not sure if that was the year the strings were made or just a random date on the box. But the company helped out and everything is good now :)	-1
I managed to get through one night at a gig with these strings. I have been playing for 50 years and have used many D'addario strings and other products. These strings will not play in tune( and yes i did the intonation)!!	-1
I am really getting disappointed with these strings I never had a problem. My Hi E strings are breaking in the middle (between tuners and nut) not at a stress or contact point and (2) strings in the last week have come unraveled down at the bridge end, one on a ES335 the other on a Telecaster with a Babicz bridge, the string doesn't even have a turn in that bridge. I regularly bend a whole step not much more. I'm going to contact the company about this and I don't think these are imitations I have checked the bar code for that. none else having this issue? I had a B string break for no reason too.	-1
Some of my strings weren't fully wrapped, which in turn ruins the playability ofba guitar. Nonetheless, I got what I paid for. Dissapointed in quality, however.	-1
My first desk mic stand, and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use. It worked once when I originally set it, then kaput. It's never worked properly since. I still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it's at the right height. I would not purchase this product again.	-1
Too thick for drop D it is just in comfortable. Even in drop c they feel way too chunky.	-1
Frankly I did not like the design of the dispenser. Prefer vacuum packed strings. I have six guitars, I change my guitar strings simultaneously each month. I think in this case comes to damaging moisture easily release them the ropes yet. Dispenser design really bad, hard to pull some strings that's not good, it hurts, buy this package by mistake, I'm sorry	-1
good value unfortunate.	-1
After putting the strings on the guitar I noticed that 3rd string had a different tint from other 5 strings. Also it's thickness was nearly identical to the second string and sound it made was somehow out of place.  Other 5 strings were in perfect condition but I ordered a set of 6 and expected to receive them all in a decent condition. I am disappointed, thus 1 star.	-1
Having used D'Addario happily (as well as other brands) over the years, I felt a bit pissed off when, several weeks after purchasing these, I opened them and saw that they had a lot of corrosion.  I like the enviromentally friendly packaging, but it may have not worked this time. Or else they may need some QC.	-1
I loved the idea of this pack immediately and purchased them. But unfortunately, G string (009) broke while tuning just after I put it on. (Bonus: It scratched my hand.)	-1
I have played on D'addario Before,  actually the first string I started out on. Super light's are ok,  but can wear out real fast,  So, It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's,  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings,  I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's,  cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.  Personally,  I don't like D'addario's at all,  I find the tone to bright.	-1
ok	-1
Strings 5 and 6 (b and high e) broke as I was putting them on, not as good as the EXL 140s. unfortunately cant afford to buy a new pack to restring my PXD void 1.	-1
I played these strings for like three months and still don't sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I've also been watching all his old interviews on YouTube and not once does he admit to the fact that he would have been nothing without this particular gauge of strings.  Nor does he cop to the fact that he used a plain 20 for the G string.  I am not impressed.  I will never play 13s again until I hear an official apology from his estate.  Music used to mean something, man.	-1
After around 10 years of using these, I am finally switching to a different brand. The last 4 3set packs I have purchased came with at least 1 string deffective. Waste of time and money. Sometimes you can tell the string is deffective right away, but other times it takes a few strummings. This last one started to de-tune by itself brand new.	-1
The grip is too tight for some harmonicas I have. Opening it up is somewhat of a chore, and I feel like it crushes the harmonica to the point of perhaps damaging it. Try something else.	-1
I studied the reviews on this rack for several months - finally did it.  BIG waste of money for me.  It might be okay for playing blues, I don't know.  But I play melody, and I found it virtually impossible to adjust it to an angle so that I could comfortably and consistently play single notes.  I also found the neck part to be really uncomfortable.  On the upside, the concern that many people have with getting the harmonica in and out of the spring proved inconsequential to me - I slipped my harps in and out with very little trouble.	-1
not happy ...	-1
If you like the sound of new strings these aren't you're best choice for your guitar	-1
The first two sets of strings were fine, loved them. Just opened the third pack and found they'd left out the 1st and 2nd (E & B) strings. Bought them long enough ago that I can't ask for a refund - which I wouldn't ask for since I already used two sets. But I do think they should send me my other two strings.	-1
They're probably fine for standard 7 string tuning. However, on my Ibanez RG7 string they're incredibly loose and wobbly even when tuned down a half-step from standard. Bottom line if you're playing in anything other than standard don't even bother. Personally I don't even really like these anyway but they are not the worst strings for the price.	-1
Yeah, so after breaking 6 Ernie Ball high e strings in a row on my Parker Fly AND Parker NiteFly SA I ordered Electro Harmonix and broke that one too, then I ordered these with the reinforced ball ends- to discover that YOU GAVE ME TWO LOW E STRINGS AND NO A STRING IN THIS  PACKAGE.  Thanks, so so much for that.  So far the D'Addarios are the only strings that have not broken instantly.  You guys in the string business seriously need to get it together.  I think I'm in over one hundred bucks on stringing these two guitars and it has been some kind of surreal nightmare.	-1
I play a Taylor 614ce and I decided to try these out and I was majorly disappointed.  They sounded very harsh in the attack, they felt sticky to the touch, and the balance was way off.  After a few hours the tone was already dying and the 4th and 3rd strings sounded like old nylon strings.  I remember why I stopped using these several years ago.  They sound as cheap as they cost.	-1
Great string! BUT.... Gave two stars since 3 strings popped within 3 weeks. I understand it's extra light gauge yet I still think it should last longer.	-1
I bought these strings to use for my 6 string to tune to drop B ..what I got was no 54 gauge string and 2 extra light strings !!! So I was disappointed ..won't buy again	-1
I bought this from guitar center. I'm glad they come in three packs because I popped #1 #3 and #6 all at the  same time I was replacing my old strings. I use to buy this brand. I wonder what had happened to quality. My Taylor deserves a lot better.	-1
Not the best strings.	-1
I recently purchased these strings twice within the same month. The first set's G string popped while I was tuning from Drop C to E standard as slow as possible and almost immediately after I started winding it popped. Then my high e string popped while loosening it from E Standard to Drop C. The second set I bought five days ago and when I set it up in E Standard and it played perfectly fine then I tuned it to Drop C; everything fine. Suddenly while starting to tune back to E Standard not even turning the peg a quarter of the way "snap!"  it broke. I do not recommend these strinags, particularly for their inability to be tuned back and/or forth, even slowly without breaking. For this reason I recommend Ernie Ball or Fender strings. The only positive thing I have to say about these strings is the bright, clear, soft tone along with their great ability to stay in tuning once tuned better than some brands such as Ernie Ball.	-1
These are horrible. I can't believe D'Addario would have these out on the market. When I played electric, I wouldn't use nothing but their strings but as far as their Acoustic ones are concerned, these are total crap.  They lose their brightness after a couple of days and they don't stay in tune very well either.  I just ordered some Martin SP's which I know from experience , are worth the price and long lasting. Stay away from these.	-1
I don't like the feel of these strings or the way my guitar sounds.  Trying something else!	-1
Got these for my kids guitar thinking they'd be easy on his fingers.  They're too thin.  They barely register on the pickups, presumably no enough mass to get a good response.  They also go sharp way too easy if you play chords.  Switched to 9's.  These are horrible.	-1
I use elixers but was looking to save some money. Well I should've just gotten the elixers. One set of elixers will last 2x longer than this entire box.	-1
2 strings broke while stretching them and can't get hold of D'Addario on their website!!! A little upset!!!!!!;;!;	-1
Amazing at first but after not playing for 3 weeks in my case they got rusted really bad...might go back to elixirs or other strings that won't rust as fast.	-1
The small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning.  I haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball end.  Luckily I bought the three pack.  But I can't recommend this product.	-1
Some say that this will fix all of your G String issues on a LesPaul type of guitar (I have a Gretsch Pro Jet). While this is true, it will also kill the tone of the guitar. I am not sure why, but this one string made a large impact on the tone of my guitar and I felt like I was playing a very dull guitar with almost no high end capabilities. This was a deal breaker for me since this made the guitar's high end (which is already the weak link on any LesPaul type guitars) even worse.  I would only recommend these string to someone who plays jazz and similar styles and has a tuning issue. Ohterwise I would say they take away more than they give.  In short, while it may fix the tuning issues with the G string it will also affect your tone negatively.	-1
Hi! I clearly remember buying a set of 10 normal light strings D'Addario (10-46). And i just received one set of strings. I mean ... apparently you made a mistake. you sent me a package of one set of strings, when in fact buy the set of 10. I really need to solve my problem because i want to keep my instrument working. I hope you can help me to give my opinion on the matter.  Thanks in advance for your attention...	-1
D'Addario,what's up? These didn't last long at all. I don't play my Martin very often,(too busy with electrics..) but these were trashed in a month. Guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now? Never purchase again.	-1
4 of the strings snapped Two high E's Two B's	-1
Was pretty fast shipping but the strings make a strange sound. When you play you can hear an extra sound that shouldn't be there.	-1
I've been using daddario for over a decade and I got really disappointed. the first set I opened was okay, but the second featured a very prolongued coating defect. I don't intend to return the whole package because I'm not living in the US now. but I definitely won't buy another.	-1
when I was young 12's were good .....at 70 not anymore	-1
ok	-1
I have used D'Addario's for years now, and this was the first set I was immediately disappointed with. They developed corrosion patches on several of the octave strings within weeks of putting them on my guitar. They do sound fantastic, feel great, good resonance, but once the corrosion starts the sound quality and feel of the strings deteriorates quickly. I will not be getting another set of these strings, and cannot recommend them.  As a baseline measurement, I have several other guitars with D'Addario strings on them and none of them, have shown such rapid corrosion.	-1
i don't know if i just got a dud but, i went through 3 high e strings in 3 days. the first one snapped before it could get to e, the second one snapped while loosening the string (seriously!?). and the third one just snapped while sitting in high e.	-1
I have six guitars that I need to keep fresh strings on, and I thought I was getting a deal here, but I was extremely disappointed when these strings lost their punch almost immediately. I usually can count on D'Adario for a good, long lasting clean sound, but these guys just deadened out so quickly that I'll be going back to Ernie's from now on.	-1
Sound is great but quickly fades with corrosion.	-1
This is nightmare! I wish I can put zero stars for this product- they sound very unpleasant below 5th fret and is squeaking like hell when move your fingers. Very disappointed.	-1
Bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand. Mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges. The strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I didn't like. Tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes. G-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\	-1
My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good. I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light. The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly. But the sound is the problem. It's terrible. They sound very muddy. Crisp tone distinction is just not there. I thought light would be the better route, but now I'm not sure. I purchased some others to try. Also, since a purchased a 3 pack. I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings.	-1
nunca llegaron a mis manos	-1
the sound of the strings is very low, without presence, with little brightness and they oxidize soon.	-1
Sounds ok, durability really sucks... Just buy when there's not Elixir or Earnie Ball available.	-1
The worst, low quality strings I have ever used in over 3 decades of playing the guitar. I've used several different strings in my lifetime, from GHS Boomers to Fender Bullets, to my only true love, Ernie Ball Super Slinky's, and I have to say these are the absolute worst strings I've ever played... here is why... They NEVER stay in tune on any guitar I own (and I've tried themon several, from ESPs to Gibsons, to USA Fenders). I am CONSTANTLY tuning these POS strings. One chord after tuning and the whole guitar needs to be re-tuned. Next, they stay bright for about 2 hours. These are some of the deadest feeling/sounding strings I have ever played. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and I really do not know why so many people love these so much. I thikn it's because they are cheap and marketed well. Sadly, like I said... to me, worst string ever made. Makes sense I was buying these 10 packs for like $16.	-1
I decided to get this because I have 14 guitars and buying strings can get expensive. Plus these are the strings I prefer anyways. Had high hopes for it but even looking at the picture I thought "I wonder how they get the strings to not bind up inside?". The answer? They didn't. First string I went to grab was the low E. I followed the instructions and held the rest of the strings in place while pulling and it got stuck. Pulled as hard as I could without risking damage to the string and it would only come out about 6 inches...and then it wouldn't go back in. I tried another string, same thing. I now had 2 low E strings sticking out 6 inches from the box. I had no choice but to open the box up all the way, take apart the plastic spools inside, unwind ALL of the low E strings, and then try to wrap them back up again. The result? I now have 25 brand new low E strings with finger prints all over them. Thought my problems were over once I finished with the 3 wound strings. Nope. Sure enough went to grab a G and it got stuck. Took some serious coaxing to get it out. I would rather pay the extra money for 25 individual sets of these strings than ever get this bulk box again. They didn't even wrap each bundle of strings in protective sleeves either so by the time I use the last few sets they will probably be corroded and useless. Especially the low E's thanks to my prints. Basically what I'm saying is unless you are a guitar repair tech and plan on changing 25 sets of strings in one week do NOT buy this. Waste of money.	-1
Do not buy these strings for an Extended Range Guitar.  I have a 28.625 inch scale on my Agile 8 string and the lowest string (the 74), turns into a 50 before it reaches the nut.  Ernie Ball 8 string slinkies have the exact same problem.  The only manufacturer who doesn't skimp on winding the whole string seems to be DR for their Tite Fit Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes strings.	-1
I kept these on for about a week and switched to dunlop heavy core. They don't handle down tuning very well and they have a odd metal (not the music style) sound to them.	-1
I bought a set of 3 regular light gauge (.10) strings.  When I went to install the low E string, it must have been defective, because there was hardly any tension on the string I was winding when it broke just before the saddle.  I have included a picture of the break as a customer picture.  I was able to replace it with the low E string from the next set, however I'm still out a set of strings.  It isn't worth the hassle to return the pack, so I'm keeping them, but this'll probably be the last time I purchase from this brand.	-1
I've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune.

Let me start off by saying 2 things...  One, i usually don't write negative reviews.. this one is important though because this product has taken away my favorite hobby for over a month now...  Two, that in not an amateur player and have been around guitars quite a bit in my life so I know what I'm doing with guitars...  I've played and used MANY different brands and types of strings and until now my two "go to" brands for good strings at a decent price were DR & D'Addario (Thomastic Infeld's are the best IMHO, but they fall well outside of the "decent price" genre...)  Anyway, About a month ago I needed some strings and since I had heard of the new BT sets from D'Addario I thought I'd give em' a shot....  I've regretted it ever since.... (I ordered the  EXL120BT's)  To the point.....  I install the strings, stretch them a little afterwards, tune em, clean/polish everything, spray a small coat of Fingerease and let it dry, etc...  My standard string install method I've used a 100x over or more with no problems or no noticeable issues...  Then i start to playing....  (biggest mistake I've made this year so far)....  Around 2 minutes into playing on the new strings (I use a few Gilmour solos to stretch the strings out after I install a set) I notice that my fingers on my left hand are REALLY starting to hurt, (especially my ring finger)....  When I stop and take a look at my fingers, I can see little tiny "fine hair" like metal splinters ALL OVER each finger, and a few of the larger normal sized splinters most of us have seen from time to time...  Some are really small and difficult to see without a magnifying glass, and, others are your standard metal shard, but ALL hurt like %#!$@!!!!  ESPECIALLY when you touch anything with those fingers... (You know, like a guitar fretboard for instance)  Fast forward to today....  And I SWEAR that I am not exaggerating....  I have not been able to play guitar since this happened due to the pain in my fingers, and I have pulled no less than 30 metal splinters from my middle, pointer and pinky finger on my left hand combined.... (I have finally gotten them all out as of about a week ago, which is around 3 weeks after the "incident")  As for my ring finger, the last count on it was 63 metal splinters (most being the little fine hair-like ones that are difficult to see without a good magnifying glass and get out without precision tweezers, but feel like knife wounds when you touch a hard object) that I have removed...  There are still several in this finger of the larger type and are so deep that I am unable to get to them so far..  I'm going to have to visit a doctor for these most likely...  Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another thing this company makes...  If you had gone through what I have (and still am), I can assure you that you'd be there with me...  Worst experience in my life with a product..  If I was the lawsuit type, they would have one....  (& if this doesn't end soon, they may still)  BUYER BEWARE.....  Don't say you weren't warned....	-1
CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again	-1
I don't know what the problem is. I just went through 2 high E strings in less than a month. I ordered this pack and gave a set to my friend. I kept 2 for my self thinking they would last me,but the high E quickly broke off...the first time could've been my fault I guess, I was trying to stretch the string out but it broke off. the second time I was just retuning. since I do do that a lot. I go from standard sometimes all the way down to B..As I was dropping the string, it just broke off. i've used nothing but Ernie Ball slinky's since I first began playing guitar and those are the strings that i've pretty much stuck to. They have never broken this quickly ever.  I don't know if it's the quality of the d'addario's or my guitar has some bridge issues.. But I have never had strings break off on me so easily...Since Amazon is only offering Slinky's as add on items I went with these even though I had never used a set ....Maybe I was wrong to try a different brand I had never used..  UPDATE: I was contacted by the company and they were able to solve my issue. I think I may have gotten some old sets,i'm not quite sure,but the year on the box was 2007,i'm not sure if that was the year the strings were made or just a random date on the box. But the company helped out and everything is good now :)	-1
I managed to get through one night at a gig with these strings. I have been playing for 50 years and have used many D'addario strings and other products. These strings will not play in tune( and yes i did the intonation)!!	-1
Frankly I did not like the design of the dispenser. Prefer vacuum packed strings. I have six guitars, I change my guitar strings simultaneously each month. I think in this case comes to damaging moisture easily release them the ropes yet. Dispenser design really bad, hard to pull some strings that's not good, it hurts, buy this package by mistake, I'm sorry	-1
After putting the strings on the guitar I noticed that 3rd string had a different tint from other 5 strings. Also it's thickness was nearly identical to the second string and sound it made was somehow out of place.  Other 5 strings were in perfect condition but I ordered a set of 6 and expected to receive them all in a decent condition. I am disappointed, thus 1 star.	-1
Having used D'Addario happily (as well as other brands) over the years, I felt a bit pissed off when, several weeks after purchasing these, I opened them and saw that they had a lot of corrosion.  I like the enviromentally friendly packaging, but it may have not worked this time. Or else they may need some QC.	-1
I have played on D'addario Before,  actually the first string I started out on. Super light's are ok,  but can wear out real fast,  So, It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's,  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings,  I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's,  cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.  Personally,  I don't like D'addario's at all,  I find the tone to bright.	-1
These pegs are very nice looking and matched the accents on my Yamaha LJ6. Problem was the tension on all strings except for the low E string pulls out. The cost to try these out were not a big deal and not worth my effort to return.	-1
Would not stay put, slip out when string tension applied. May have been my guitar, which was made for non grooved pins.  Turned around so groove facing tail and worked better but still slipped.	-1
Pretty freakin' big!	-1
This Pin could not fit my seagull, the bass string does, but it can not fit in 1st and 3 rd strings	-1
These pins are skinny, I mean ridiculously skinny. There is no way to use them on my Bedell. I do not see that these come in different shank diameters, although considering that bridge pins do come in various shank diameters it is disconcerting that this company does not care. Have read some articles on fitting, but for my guitar it just was not possible. I imagine I ma not the only one to experience this.	-1
These pop right out of the holes in my guitar's bridge (Walden CG630CE) and no amount of messing around would make them stay in place while I tightened the strings.  On the other hand, the heads of the pins are quite large, and they certainly look a odd in comparison to other pins.	-1
I decided to purchase this Mandolin in order to start learning to play.  After reading some reviews and watching videos I thought it would be worth it as a beginner mandolin; I didn't want to break the bank seeing as I wasn't sure if I'd even enjoy playing it (I currently play the ukulele and guitar).  Arrived quickly but with problems.  Upon opening the box and inspection of the instrument this is what I found: missing screws on the pick guard; the metal piece that covers the strings on the body was freely floating in the bag with the mando and scratched up the back side of the body; the strings were slightly rusty; after setting up the bridge (not too hard with youtube handy) and tuning the instrument, the bridge actually would move around.  The sound was alright, not great.  To make things worse, I requested to return the defective product through the company (or exchange, but company said must return per Amazon policy and reorder, no problem) I still haven't heard back about getting the return label.  Its been 6 days so far, and I really just want my money back.  Of course as they say "you get what you paid for."  After way more research into entry level mandolins, I think I may invest in a Kentucky km-150, even though its a little more pricey.  Would not recommend primarily due to how long its taking to return the product, and of course the defects.  Would not buy again from seller either.	-1
After all the good reviews, I went for it, but I'm not super happy I did. The bore diameter on this is way smaller than my last mouthpiece - shredded my cork and I had to install a replacement. Now that my neck is recorked, I tried it again and it's louder but considerably squankier than I'm used to. Good for marching and outdoors, perhaps, but you kind of sacrifice some nuances and quickly changing octaves...	-1
This is not a good mouthpiece. I needed a new mouthpiece and bought this for the low price buy it wasn't worth it. Squeals horrid all the time even after practicing quite a few times. My high baffle metal mouthpiece was easier to get used to.	-1
this mouthpiece is very bad quality,you cannot hold out a steady note with this and is pretty hard to play.my old one is doesn't even have a brand and is much better.all the products i bought from Rico sucks and i will not be buying from them again.fortunately i was able to get a refund.	-1

Not good	-1
I have a Stradivarius model 37. This is the poorest Val protector I have ever owned and I have been playing over 40 years. It fits loosely, it is very thin  and  the Velcro is not positioned correctly. I wish I would've never bought this. I suggest you pass on this one too. I'm going to try somewhere else to get a decent valve protector.	-1
Alright Ive used this guitar for about 3-4 weeks its extremely uncomfortable to play when sitting down so this would only be comfortable to play while standing up with a strap on bottom line is the guitar looks "cool" at first but at this price a lot of kids will be buying this guitar thus making the unique look it has not so unique so if you buying this for the looks save your money its uncomfortable as hell to play while sitting down	-1
This board is a total waste of money. It buzzes terribly, which is why I sent it back. The board itself is made of cheap fuzz and is very oddly shaped. The bag is not too bad though, but offers no protection. I ended up getting a great board used off ebay and I saved a huge amount for a waaaaay better product.	-1
The velcro surface is very cheap, the riser broke within a week of light use (the screws stripped), the power supply wouldn't work with any of my Boss pedals due to excessive humming so I still had to power them with batteries.  You might as well save your money and spend it on a better product.	-1
Okay, so I purchased this because of the great reviews. This is not a quality product.  The mouthpiece was not aligned with the holes. It only plays 1 1/2 octaves before it produces horrible harmonics and refuses to hit a correct pitch.  Overall, it is only a novelty.  It is a child's toy whistle.  Don't expect to play any serious music through it.  A plastic Chinese whistle would play as well.	-1
Very cheaply made.  Metal tube was rolled with seam on the bottom which affects holding,	-1
Connection doesnt fit neck of Alveraz acoustic guitar	-1
After less than 20 hours of gentle use, the plastic bar that attaches the strap broke - causing my bass to fall and break a tuning peg.  No abuse or aggressive play.  Cheap plastic and poor mechanical design appears to be at fault.	-1
I don't like writing bad reviews, but this one is necessary. I've been a performing musician for 40 years and never had a product fail like this one did. I loved it at first, locks on perfectly without any hassle. Last night I was playing a wedding, with a fairly lightweight bass too, and the plastic just snapped right off from the piece that's connected to the strap. The part over the strap peg stayed on the bass, that whole contraption though just broke in half. Impossible to fix. If I didn't have another strap I'd have been in trouble for the rest of the evening. Strap is only a couple of months old, and I only used it about 5 times (my other basses have straplocks on them). Irony of this whole thing is that the whole point of this strap is so that your instrument won't fall off. With this, it will fall off - and you won't even be able to put it back on again. Yes, I may have gotten one that was defective, but I don't think so. Looked fine. Plastic just snapped right in half.  [edit] After reading some of the other reviews, I want to add that there is a chance what another reviewer is true. Perhaps this isn't a legit Planet Waves product, but a fake from this particular seller. I always believed them to have a solid reputation, but the strap I had was a cheap piece of garbage.	-1
The quality of the product is actually very good, I'm giving a one star review because I ordered the strap in red and received a brown one. The price of the item didn't justify a return so I'm stuck with the brown strap.	-1
nice strap, crappy lock design.	-1
Okay, the idea is good, but the materials used are inferior. What good is a locking mechanism if the cheap plastic breaks off? The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky. Where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. The locking part is a good idea. Not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. I had an old Ernie Ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. I will use it from now on.	-1
Because of the price, I bought 4 of these straps.  2 have failed after a year.  In both cases the plastic piece that the nylon wraps around to attach to strap to the locking mechanism broke away allowing the nylon strap to fall away from the lock.  Fortunately, I do 99% of my playing sitting down so there was no guitar tragedy associated with the strap failure.  Pros - easy to use - clever concept - good price - EXCELLENT customer service from D'Addario when the first one failed.  Cons - NOT a good fit on my acoustic/electric -- works but is really tight and I'll be changing to another locking method. - Two of my guitars do not fit well in their cases with the large locking mechanism. - Locking mechanism is uncomfortable against my wrist on my travel electric.  (unique case) - Cheaply constructed...I'm a sitting player and gently place guitars in guitar stand between sessions....and it still broke. I'd hate to see how they fare under more stressful conditions.	-1
Worked only on my electrics with conventional thin strap pins. Strap material I find very scratchy, had to put a towel on my shoulder/neck.	-1
I probably didn't realize what I was purchasing.  The quick release is HUGE - it is 2 inches wide and 4 inches long!.  Also the nylon strap feels cheap.  I have a Levy's cotton strap that is much more comfortable.	-1
I was disappointed.  The cleaning cloth it comes with was like linen but shed like crazy.  I don't think I want those little pieces of lint inside my flute.  You would think it would come with a better quality of cloth since you have to clean the flute after each play.	-1
Not my type	-1
Doesn't fit my les paul and is super shirt in length	-1
This strap's mechanism is so large it can't work on the neck of either of my acoustics (Dean or the Taylor).  I can't see it working on any acoustic neck button.  Additionally, the Taylor's jack just barely fits into the hole, but cannot be locked down.  This was a total fail on acoustic guitars.	-1
Disclaimer: I don't know anything about the traditions of this insturment, but I've played them and I know what sounds good to me. Although large and well made, this guiro sounded dull and too quiet in comparison to the kids' wood guiro sold for $5 to $9. The problem is not the plastic, but the design: You hold the resonant part in your fingers and that dampens the sound. It would sound a lot better with a solid handle at one end and the other completely open, with slits down most of the length.	-1
sized for a child	-1
ITS GOOD FOR AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR BECAUSE THE FAUX LEATHER ENDS ARE SO THIN. I WONT PUT IT ON ANY OF MY BASS' I DONT THINK I COULD TAKE THE WEIGHT. SO I PUT IT ON MY ACOUSTIC GUITAR,TIED 1 END TO THE TUNING PEG AND 1 AT THE BOTTOM OF GUITAR. WORKS GREAT FOR THAT. BUT DEFFINETLY WOULD NOT HOLD WEIGHT FOR VERY LONG. JUST CHEAP,CHEAP,AND DID I SAY CHEAP MATERIAL!	-1
Bought one of these at Guitar Center and loved it. Ordered two from this Amazon merchant and got two guitar straps that smell like I they have been soaked in diesel and petroleum. I guess they came right off the boat from Malaysia or Indonesia. I tried washing them and the oil substance floated on top of the water. If you use one of them your clothes end up smelling very bad.	-1
Based upon some of the other reviews, I feel I got a different product, as it didn't fit the descriptions given by others. I ordered two of these, and both were very thin material, not sturdy at all. Second, both straps were not adjustable to 59". Both mine measured 45" from strap button hole to strap button hole, fully-extended. They are useless to me, as my guitar, a dreadnought, covers the middle of my chest when I put it on. I believe I was given a substitute product, since when I ordered these straps, the price was just $1.00, and now they're back up to $4.95 as I write this. I'm really sick of these Amazon substitutions. For what I paid, I won't bother returning them...not worth the hassle. I will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars. Very disappointed. Warning...if you see a price drop below $4.95, don't buy...it's probably not the product that's described here.	-1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fishman-V200-Professional-Violin-Pickup/dp/B0002IHFGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fishman V200 Professional Violin Pickup</a>  I am using this pickup thru a preamp, and it does sound awful, it has the potential to sound good, the problem is inconsistency; As soon as you move the PU one nanometer, the sound, tone and impedance is all different. Very hard to maintain, didn't like it's sound. sounds "piezoish" like all other piezos in the market.  Would love to hear about a PU (even bridge PU - must be feedback resistable) that has better results as far is it concerns "acoustic tone".	-1
I have a Taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. Rather than ruin the finish of the guitar I just got a different strap. Plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since I had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where I liked it to play. If the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made.	-1
I should have known from the price that this would be a stiff, uncomfortable guitar strap.  My recommendation: spend a little more and get a comfortable strap.  The Slip Off protection is a pretty good design and works fine, though I had to double the peg in one place to make room for the strap end.	-1
I'm either going to return this or sell it. I bought it for my five string, installed it as directed and found that it mutes the tone of my higher register a bit and makes it sound tinny when I'm playing acoustically with the pick up attached.	-1
I bought one of these in the beginning - just to have something - as this is better than having nothing at all - but it's certainly nothing special. The material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain, so I only used it for a very short time.  On the other hand, if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of, then you'll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point. I upgraded to a really nice 3" wide black leather Levy's guitar strap - which is five stars all the way.  If you're a newbie and don't have a strap, and are on a tight budget and need something, then this Planet waves strap will probably work for you - till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear. Just my 2 cents.	-1
You get what you pay for. I don't play heavy metal, I play alt rock. I used this for about 2 weeks, one day a week, and it has already fallen apart. The items front plastic peeling has come off. Also, it has already lost its stick. Would not refer this product to anyone.	-1
i don't write many reviews but i ordered 3 of these just to stock up on basic extra straps so im never without one on a gig.....WAY TOO LONG ! to get the guitar (strat) up to a practice (abdomen) level your almost out of room for the buckles to take any more slack. i don't know how more reviewers don't notice this but if you wear your guitar up high you'll be out of luck here....i have plenty of straps and these seem like they're made in "Tall" size....just checked back and no, they appear normal in the ads. im normal height and size, like i said all my other straps are fine. i don't like the feel of the strap being fully doubled up with slack. i would NOT recommend these if you don't wear the guitar around your knees.	-1

I clicked on a strap with the locking ends.  When I changed the color aparently it changed it to a strap without the locking ends.  Bad glitch with the system, the strap is fine for a non locking strap but that's not what I ordered.	-1
Unlike all the reviews I'm seeing and the picture of the item itself, my strap did not come with any kind of locks on it.  It's just a regular red strap with leather (or fake leather) ends to stick the strap pins into.  There's no locking mechanism to speak of.  I don't know if I was just sent the wrong item or what, but it's a Planet Waves strap, looks otherwise identical to the picture above.	-1
Reaks, and leaves black marks on your bridge!  Otherwise, does it's job as a mute.	-1
This model seemed a good idea. Being made of rubber, I thought it would fit well different bridges. The problem here is this particular one stinks so much, of chemicals, that it's impossible to be in the same room. I'm not exaggerating. After a few minutes the smell is all over the place. The seller suggested to rub it with baking soda, and leave it outside the house for a day or so. It didn't really do anything. I threw it away.	-1
Look, these products do a good job of cleaning your horn, they don't leave fiber or anything inside your horn, but the reason I say avoid these products at all cost comes with the storage of these types of devices. Unless you have an extra space to store a pad saver, a bell brush, and a neck saver don't bother getting them, otherwise they leave all that moisture you were supposed to take out of your horn and ruins your pads an encourages the growth of mold. Avoid these and get a simple silk swab with a weight attached to a string. It gets the moisture OUT.	-1
This product is not essential at all! It barely feels like its cleaning anything, and it doesnt reach all the way to the curved bottom!  I easily forget to take it out and it renders me from playing. Over all it is a big nuissense!	-1
Firstly, you need to know that this ships from China.  There's nothing wrong with that, except that it will take 2-3 weeks to arrive, so don't hold your breath...  ...until it does.  Because this thing stinks.  Literally.  It smells like it was carved of rubber from the sole of your local gas station attendant's shoe.  I should have read the other reviews before buying.  Another reason to pay attention to reviews would have been to avoid the black smudge that this POS left on the violin bridge.  Cheap rubber.  As to its effectiveness, it reduced the volume of the violin from an 11 to about an 8.  Not as much as expected.  I'm not a complainer, and I leave plenty of good reviews for worthy products.  This isn't one.  This thing is cheap in every respect of the word.  It's bad for your violin, probably bad for your health, and a waste of $5.99.	-1
I suppose it would have worked okay if I'd tried it. But when it arrived and I took it out of its plastic sleeve it stank so bad, it almost made my eyes water. The petroleum smell literally filled the practice room. I didn't get far enough to trying it out. I threw it away. It took almost two days for the smell to dissipate. I guess I'll have to stick with my non-odiferous metal mute.	-1
Doesn't do much.  Fits somewhat loosely on my fiddle, provides some small amount of  sound dampening.	-1
It did not do all that much to quite the violin.	-1
I went on a uni-vibe comparison mission. I was really excited about this pedal until I tested it. In the end, it was the second worst pedal I tested -- all based on the sound. It's a tone killer. There were some things I really like about it -- but the sound wasn't one of them. The major problem with this pedal is that it performs heavy EQ on your tone -- massively boosting bass and cutting the mid-range and highs out of your signal. This might sound cool in your bedroom, but when you put it in the mix of a band, you will likely get lost behind the kick drum and bass player, resulting in mush. I don't believe this pedal will "cut" in the mix. It seems like it was designed for the bedroom, not the stage.  I evaluated the pedal like this:  PROS - Small form factor on board, just slightly larger than a boss pedal - Standard 9V Center negative power supply, and the jack is located on the back where it doesn't conflict with patch cables. - Large easily visible control settings (this is nice.) - Can "toe tweak" the speed setting, although not as easily as some other pedals - I'd prefer the speed on the right, not left and a flat edge on the knob that I can catch with the edge of my shoe. - Quality construction - LED "on/off" indicator, and indicator is not obnoxious  CONS - Boosts bass, cuts mids and highs from your signal (major problem with this pedal) - LED indicator does not pulse the speed setting (minor issue)  SUMMARY I wanted to like this pedal at $150. But in the end, its massive EQ of my tone just makes it a preset equalizer, more than an uni-vibe, and it is set to "Mush". Also, it doesn't sound like a real uni-vibe. A real univibe doesn't modify the tone like that.  SUGGESTED REDESIGN: - Flip the location of the speed and Intensity knobs so the speed is toe tweakable with the right foot. Consider a larger knob with a flat edge for toe tweaking (see fulltone mini deja vibe), and possibly relocate the speed to lower right. This is a really nice feature. - Correct this circuit to put the treble and mids back in, and stop boosting the bass. - With these changes, this would be a great pedal. As it is, its a tone killer. The sound is the major problem here.  ----------------------------------------------------- Other pedals I tested and compared -----------------------------------------------------  Shaky Jimi Vibe -  A steal at $60 -and my number one pick based on sound and features, not price.  A great pedal, doesn't take a lot of space up, standard power supply, good visibility on control knob settings. Does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise. This is the only pedal in the uni-vibe group I tested that I can say that about and it's why it's my #1 pick. Might have slightly less intensity capability on the univibe effect as some of the others - but seems like enough to me!  Overall I LOVE this pedal at under 60 bucks. Only downsides I see are the LED does not flash the speed rate, and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to "toe tweak" with my right foot. Quality seems ok, but time will tell on durability. Some users reported issues - but at this price, you could buy two and have a backup, and you would still save $60-80 over the price of most uni-vibes.  - Fulltone Mini Deja vibe -- highest quality construction (as expected at $200). The large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking -- very useful on a vibe pedal. My complaint is that this vibe colors my tone - it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass. This probably helps the sound stand out in a mix, however, I'd rather that my vibe not provide EQ because when I switch it on or off, I don't want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back "my sound". I was able to match exactly an authentic original Uni-vibe sound with some adjusting. It seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also. I have a love-hate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it. Some days I hate it...but I like the build quality and the speed control. I originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didn't strip the treble off my tone -- until I realized the mids were boosted, the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked. Mixed bag, and at $200 shouldn't be.  - Dunlop Uni-vibe -- Cool stainless steel construction. Knobs were hard to see settings. placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best. Non standard 18V power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick. Sound was very good but did also color my EQ sound by boosting the bass, and muffling the mids and highs slightly. On the one hand, this sound matched a lot of recorded uni-vibe sounds I've heard. On the other hand, once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix. The seller had a 3 day return policy (3 days??!!) so I returned it and they lost the sale. Othewise, I would still be thinking about this one. I was on the fence about whether it was my winner. I was able to match a true uni-vibe sample, but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me. At $220 I'd have to love it to keep it. This pedal also offers the ability to add an expression pedal for about $70-80 more. I wish more others had that option.  - BBE Soul Bender - My least favorite Vibe. It had extreme muffling of mids and highs, heavy boost of bass. In a band mix, I'm pretty sure it would get totally lost. At home, might sound ok. form factor was good, controls were simple, I think it pulsed the speed. My recollection is it had an overly bright blue LED. It was the first vibe I bought, and I only compared to Fulltone and Dunlop before returning it. Had some useable sounds, but with the intensity above 50% had an annoying "womp womp womp" of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar -- a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion. With intensity below 50% it was usable...kind of. But a tone muffler. I returned this one early.  - Dunlop ROTO-Vibe : A good choice (perhaps the only choice) if you MUST have expression pedal controlled speed adjustment. Didn't color the tone - and that was a problem on most other uni-vibes tested. Limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me. Intensity range seemed less than other pedals too. Large footprint if mounted on board, but also offers the ability to take NO space on the board by not mounting it. I didn't like that when you switch the effect on, you are automatically at high speed due to the mechanical nature of the design. Some awkwardness in the placement of controls and power plug vs guitar cables when plugged in. Std power supply a plus. LED indicators good and flash the speed. Durable construction although the mechanical nature means in time something will need lubricating and you may need to replace internal gears or pots. Overpriced 1.5 to 2X in my opinion.  - Other general modulation effects. Univibes are effectively a phase effect - without the swooshy space-age edge on the sound. You can probably modify a modern phaser pedal to get the univibe sound which is like a vibrato plus analog chorus combined. A modern phaser is close, a modern flanger is much too space-age sounding. Vibrato pedals can capture the vibrato aspect of a uni-vibe and I'd recommend the behringer vibrato at $25 if you like vibrato sounds. uni-vibes are normally used for their "chorus" setting, not the vibrato setting. Didn't care for the Behringer time machine.  My gear used for testing: Fender American Deluxe stratocaster. Mesa Mini-rectifier amplifier, Mesa Rectifier 2x12 cabinet with Celestion V30's. Pedal train pedal board, voodoo labs pedal power power supplies.  A NOTE ON VENDOR SELECTION I had a very bad experience with the vendor I bought my MXR/Dunlop M68 from, and while it does not weigh at all on my review of that product, I provided a separate star rating on the vendor feedback page. I recommend if you choose to purchase that pedal (or anything else) you be careful to avoid the Amazon Marketplace vendor called MixDSPnet in San Jose, CA. In addition to charging a 15% restocking fee if you want to return the pedal (in original condition with all materials and packaging), getting them to even acknowledge the return request at all was a problem and took over a week and finally opening a claim with Amazon to get any meaningful response. Once they did communicate, they were very unprofessional. Further, when the product was shipped back signature required (as recommended by amazon), they were "not available" or refused to sign for it so after several weeks of attempting to return the product, it remains **unrefunded** despite their confirmation that I could return the item for an 85% refund. I expect I'll need to work further with Amazon in the end to get this resolved. A google earth view of their addressed explained it all. MixDSPnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex. Most Amazon marketplace sellers are just fine but this one is really not, at least when it comes to returns. Also, while they sell a few Dunlop/MXR guitar pedals, looking at their site reveals it's not their primary business - they seem to sell a bunch of other non-musical widgets. My recommendation is that you find a vendor who is in the musical instrument business and who will provide the typical no cost refunds for 30 to 45 days as most large musical instrument retailers do, should you need it. They have a few hundred positive transactions, so maybe can be OK but I can only comment on my experience and this was the worst online transaction I've ever had shopping on amazon.	-1
Not sure if I'm using it wrong but it seems pretty straight forward. Place over strings on bridge, practice with out driving those around you crazy. Yeah, not so much. When i think of the word mute I think of near silence. This thing only slightly lessened the horrible sounds you expect from a beginner fiddler. I use it anyways. Gives people the illusion that it could be worse.	-1
I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't.  Don't bother,it doesn't mute the strings at all.  One star, just for it getting here on time.	-1
The threads do not fit any of my cymbal stands which basically makes this product useless.. sorry	-1
As many low rating reviews have indicated, this mute mutes very little. It also tends to get stuck on my bridge.	-1
I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together. I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. The mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works VERY well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. Also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.  If You want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), I suggest you buy something else. This item does not work and is a total waste of money. I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Electric-Violin/dp/B000BRUW6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Electric Violin</a>&nbsp;bought here on Amazon (FYI, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! *Just make sure you buy&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Original-Peg-Drops-by-Ardsley/dp/B000F3JO7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Original Peg Drops by Ardsley</a>&nbsp;& a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Glaesel-Self-Adjusting-4-4-Violin-Bridge-Medium/dp/B0002II728/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Glaesel Self-Adjusting 4/4 Violin Bridge Medium</a>&nbsp;with it!).  I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way.	-1
My daughter has a 3/4 Glaesel Violin that is 16 years old (a gift from her cousin).  Last November we had to replace the bridge with a different brand because the local store only had a 4/4 Glaesal bridge and she had a school concert coming up.  The Mute fits just fine, but we tired and tried and could not get the the mute to work.  At best there was about a 5% reduction in volume. I doubt the fact that the replacement bridge being a different brand made any difference.	-1
Plus - inexpensive.  Con - really disappointing sound. This is a toy! - and as such produces an annoying clang when struck. I really wish there was an inexpensive triangle that produced a lovely sound. To get there is a mega bucks investment - the Sabian bronze triangle at $42.00. Other inexpensive rhythm instruments provide an equal experience. Save your money and don't buy this.	-1
This thing broke within 3 weeks. I play metalcore and it couldn't keep up. Go with Sabian instead. They are way more durable then these things.	-1
A friend of mine gave me a pair of these cymbals because he was cleaning out his house.  The sound is so bad on these things it is embarrassing.  They are definitely an entry level cymbal but they sound like two garbage can lids being smashed together.  I have played with Zildjain hi-hats my whole life and love them but you need to be willing to spend more to get a good sound.  Don't waste your money.	-1
junk..you get what you pay for, these are the bottom end, save your money..a-customs, k line..then youll have some quality cymbals.. these aren't even good enough for beginners,,waste of money	-1
Long time zildjan customer. This series cymbal is a joke to me. One of the worst sounding cymbals I've ever purchased. Very "tincan" sounding. But ya get what you pay for I guess. Too bad companies have out-sourced their great products of the past to China to save money/more profit just to sacrifice their quality. Never buying new crap like this again.	-1
Sounds tinny, going back to my 10 in splash.	-1
The ZBT cymbal I bought sounds cheap..I wouldn't bother with these..not what you would expect from Zildjian.	-1
Stay away. These trash can lids should stay only in the confines of your basement, should you buy them.	-1
If you do any live shows or recordings, STAY AWAY!!! They sound trashy and bend under heavy use. More like a trashcan lid. less like a quality product. I've used Zildjian since September 1998 and I decided to replace some broken and absent pieces from the kit. This was a mistake.	-1
The worst cymbals made. They sound like trashcan lids and bend as soon as you strike them. I'm very disappointed in Zildjian For even making them!	-1
i went through 2 in about 5 months but the 18 inch crash ride wen used as a ride cymbal has lasted me about a year and a half with only 1 small crack that hasn't grew and my hi-hats still sound that same way as when i took them out of the box same with m 16 inch zbt crash.....the only cymbal from the zbt line i hate is the 14" if u want a good cymbal for a cheap price buy the 16" the 14 " failed miserably	-1
Budget cymbals from all the big makers are generally overpriced brass clunkers, and the ZBT crash/ride is no exception. Good volume, but a nasty, clangy, dominant overtone that is characteristic of cheap, stamped cymbals. At this price, the cast bronze cymbals pouring out of China are a much better choice: some of the same dark, shimmering qualities of the cast bronze Zildjians, without the tight QC standards or hand hammering. Having said that, ZBTs came included with my kit, and have withstood a beating for almost 20 years. I can't imaging, who is cracking this cymbal. It's quite thick and flexible enough. Makes a nice trash cymbal now, with holes drilled and rivets.	-1
Did not meet my expectations. Solid stand, timely to assemble and disassemble. Although I was told it would, it does not allow the Chauvet 4 Bar to mount on top.	-1
As a professional DJ I would not recommend this light stand. It is too small & lightweight for most lights. Center screw holding light bar very basic and not durable.	-1
Bars are square and thin. Nothing like the round ones I am used to using... I don't even use it now.	-1
broke after 5 mins... Junk go american Dj light bridge!! Spend that extra money!!!	-1
really cheap plastic, cracked under the hinge just sitting there.  I don't understand why Hohner would put their name on this.	-1
I did not care for the sound of this Tamborine at all. The sound was way too much "head" compared to the amount of jangle produced by the metal parts. The tone of the head was also odd to my ears, maybe I just got a bad one but it was not a sound we could use in our recording studio. This had to go back.	-1
ok	-1
I should have listened to the nay-sayers when they wrote warnings of cheapness. This might be my first review that wasn't at least 4 stars (and I buy a lot on here)... It sounds awful on my mic (using for hip hop to add wetness to my snares. No matter how much EQ'ing it is proving difficult to mix a clunky cheap sounding tambourine. Oh well. Save your money and try something in a store. Trust me...	-1
The uke i received had a crack in the base and was a pretty terrible glue job. It doesn't stay in tune at all. Not much to say about this one. Try another brand if mine is any indication.	-1
Bought this stand to go in my mini-studio. Almost wanted to return it. It came missing one bolt, no extras. The stand is easy to set up, hence 2 stars, but HUGE. My Akai MPK49 is on it but does not fill the gap so I have to be careful and not knock it over. The legs extend WAY out from the stand are are hard to fit the keyboard on. If you have a HUGE deep keyboard this stand might work. Easy to set up if you have all the parts sent to you, but I would not buy it again. Some things are best not purchased online. The next stand I get I am going where they have my keyboard so I can check out the fit.	-1
Neat little toy for a kid to play with thinking he/she may become the next country music star. I think it was designed specifically for acoustic guitars, not electric. The (vocal instruction) CD that came with it also indicates that it was meant for country-style music and the thick Oklahoma-accented instructor did not not impress me with his musical intelligence. The product feels very cheap as well. I don't wanna tighten the screws too much in fear that the POS will break thru the plastic threading. I don't recommend this unless your kid wants to pretend and you have a Jackson you want to waste.	-1
I attached the device to my starter guitar (followed directions to the letter!) and now any notes that I try to play on the first, second, or third fret bangs out. I will be buying a new Guitar soon, and decided to try this on a cheap Guitar first so it might just be the build of the guitar itself. The device came on time has a sturdy build. I payed more than I really wanted to out of desperation..... I will try it on my new Guitar and write another review soon, but for now, 2 Stars...... Thanks Amazon for the opportunity to review...	-1
I was astonished at the poor quality of this item.  Immediately upon unwrapping the package I noticed that it has that 1980s "RONCO" appearance, complete with faded and stained box, out of date photo, and emblazoned with "As seen on TV".  Inside the package was a "songbook" which appeared to have been typed on an actual typewriter and copied on an antique Xerox machine showing which chords to strum while singing the titles, many of which were popular during the Civil War in the vein of "Hand Me Down My Walking Cane", "Ain't Gwine to Study War No More" and similar.  For a device intended for the beginner player the explanation of which paddle presses which fin and the chord it is supposed to produce is more complicated than actually learning to play!  Upon assembly I noticed first that it does not fit "any" guitar.  Mine is a standard classical guitar made by Ibanez. The strings are too far apart for the fins on this product to press them correctly.  The product is basically several plastic paddles with vertical fins below each which, when pressed, are intended to depress the guitar strings.  As they are made of hard plastic these fins easily slip right off the strings.  That's if you can manage to press them given that the product is so large that it is harder to get your fingers around it than it is to get into position on the strings themselves and given that the attachment scheme is unreliable and wobbles around on the neck.  Finally,  there are rubber lining strips which are supposed to protect the back of the neck and the face of the strings from the device itself.  These fail to stay attached to the device.  All in all this device has the look and feel of one of those disappointing things we used to buy through ads in the back of comic books (remember those X-Ray glasses?) and then weren't surprised when they arrived and we found they did not live up to the hype.  However, those items were generally priced at 50 cents, not 25.00  I requested a return for refund and the seller offered a refund but did not want the product back.	-1
Should have listened to the reviews.. Antiquated design. Serious string buzz AND dead strings... Followed instructions to a T. No better	-1
If you buy this, don't say "hey ladies, i play guitar!" You don't. You play guitar hero. If you buy this, you will be called a pussy by all who can ACTUALLY PLAY.	-1
garbage	-1
Did not get a good DVD  with it	-1
Does not work correctly.	-1
But the beginning guitarist soon discovers that E-Z Chord doesn't alleviate the inevitable sore finger tips common when learning chords.  EZ Chord, if installed properly will allow simple camp fire back up for songs but it won't take the place of hard work and a little pain in learning to play guitar properly. Buzzing and dead strings are common in early guitar play and EZ Chord will eliminate this, but the user is limited to only four major cords which can be used to play many songs included in the mimeographed song sheet that comes with the device. Nice try by the inventors of several devices like this, but its best to struggle a bit with basic chords, notes and scales.  You'll be a better musician for it.	-1
There is quite literally more plastic in a McDonalds happy meal toy. so Why on EARTH IS THIS $30???????????? Because the company is a greedy company that is trying to leech as much cash from their customers as possible. I thought I'd get this for my 2 year old but he can already bar a chord now so it is useless. do yourself a favor and just learn the friggin' guitar already. It's not that hard. Are you telling me my two year old is cooler than you???	-1
Have no idea how it sounds needed 12 volt adapter don't know where to get one	-1
Crapped out after a few usages, and noisy, noisy, noisy.  Bad Behringer.  Bad, bad, Behringer.	-1
low price... but I struggle to get battery in without it falling apart every time.  not unique to mine... the design is not good.  when you can get it to stay in one piece it does work.	-1
Vol pedal took away volume from my amp output.  I compared and tested between two amps with/out pedal engaged.  The killer roar and body I like in my chords was being held back.  My sustain fell short as result.  I had read the low scored reviews and am returning this pedal for a refund.  Keep trying Behringer, I look fwd to better quality fx at starving artist prices!	-1
I bought this pedal for my Behringer US600 pitch shifter in order to control the sweep of the octaving. Delivery was right around the time it was expected, which was nice. The problem most people are going to run into with using this pedal with the pitch shifter is neither the pitch shifter nor this control pedal come with very good instructions on how to hook one up to the other, other than jacking into output 2 on the FCV with the other jack in the ctrl port on the us600 (pitch shifter).  They don't specify that you have to use a stereo cord to make it work. Luckily I had one from an old computer sub as well as 2-3/8" to 1/4" adapters, THAT got it goin. But as I started using this pedal I noticed a couple other issues: the action in the sweep is VERY heavy on the heel, that is to say the heel on the pedal goes so damn low you could almost sprain your ankle using it. I tried to alleviate that by folding a guitar strap several times, wrapping it with duct tape, and velcroing it to the heel of the pedal to make the heel higher, the only issue with that is now the forward motion on the pedal is still very crazy.  Also ITS HUGE!!! This pedal is so much bigger than I expected that I thought it was something else entirely when I first got it; needless to say I made room on my pedal board for no reason, so it sits next to my pedal board.  If you're going to do the strap thing I described, take the rubber boot off of the FCV first. The adhesive on the velcro will not grip the rubber and I was using heavy duty velcro from home cheapo.  Also you will need to invest in a 12 volt power supply as apposed to just trying to jack into your daisy chain... Yes, this pedal is VERY friggin' special like that. I got a universal power supply for around $15 here on amazon and it works just fine.  Bottom line: This pedal ain't worth the time, effort or money required to use it. Spending the extra $80-$100 on the digitech whammy pedal is the only way to go. Behringer Dropped the ball hard on this one.	-1
Initially I was impressed with the construction of this pedal. It seems rather well built for the price.... thats where the positivity ends. I plugged it into my power supply and it didn't work so I switched to a 9 volt. I took the cover off, attached the battery and spent the next five minutes trying to put the cover back on correctly. The battery cover is a prime example of piss poor engineering IMHO. I plugged it into my rig and when I played I could not believe what I heard.... utter CRAP! Tinny, shrill, thin and above all NOISE NOISE NOISE! I guess there are some things you cannot go cheap on... I've learned my lesson here!	-1
All I gotta say about  this product is that I get a volume/tone loss when it's plugged; that is a very big problem for me. Other than that is very well built, but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me.	-1
The travel would be tolerable for a sitting position..., but I stand in front of a mic on stage.  The pedal generates  a lot of "noise" so I can't use it.  You get what you pay for.  King Vox and Dunlop High Gain, both passive, have passed the test, and I'm pretty picky!	-1
I should have returned this but didn't. It's ok at best. I feel like when I have this in my guitar rig it sucks the tone out. It doesn't seem to work with my mpk88 and I have no other uses for it. It is nice and heavy though. Maybe my issues are user error but I'll be replacing this with a better volume pedal for my guitar and a pedal dedicated to my keyboard.	-1
Behringer music items have all worked great for me in the past but this has a very small range of action so its almost "on off", more over it buzzed real bad.	-1
I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2. When I got it, I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal. As far as a CV controler? it sucks at that too! Why? it squeaks as you move it (after 5 minutes use, right out of the box). Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name (although only 'conceived' in Germany). It's a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares. I'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it. Also, you may say "who cares if it squeaks a little"? well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a 'wah' effect at low volume in the studio! Good luck if you buy it.	-1
It holds the guitar up, but the inside of the strap will rub your neck raw....do not recommend	-1
Looks nice and is well made. But it's TOO LONG for most guitar/ bass players--- unless you play with a guitar at your knees. Literally can't get this short enough to use as a bass strap.	-1
Fender monogrammed pattern stitched onto a cheapo beginner strap.  Thin, scratchy, stiff, poly material.  I have a couple of these Fender Monogrammed strats, they have leather backing.  Wanted to get another like them.  I guess they don't make them anymore.  The stock picture shows a leather backing like they are supposed to have.  But the one sent to me was certainly not leather.  Maybe this is a cheap chinese knockoff?  Who knows...  Luckily Amazon is awesome and I was able to return it for a full refund.	-1
Piece of junk.	-1
The inside stitched backing of these straps are made out of a cheap, slick material. The strap is also VERY long compared to my other guitar straps, which I didn't like.  I DID find a different strap that was very similar to this strap, but had quality materials for around $17 at my local guitar store.	-1
As other reviewers have said this is not a high quality strap.  It is lined with a cheap plastic material over a felt pad on the back of the strap.  The stitch quality of the non-machine made portions is terrible - untrimmed threads in many locations and some crooked stitching.  I was motivated by the Fender name and visual appearance which are great and associated with high quality products - this was intended for a American Stratocaster Deluxe.  I've ordered a replacement hoping for better.  We'll see in a few days whether a second strap lacks the stitching problems.  I'm suspecting I'm still going to be unhappy given the plastic strap which was not disclosed on the product description.	-1
genuine fender part that was defective. is a dual pot with center detent-- supposed to be 250k/1megk. top pot was correct (1megK) but bottom pot measured out at 2megK. It also did not Taper off but jumped almost immediately to 0K. Rather than return for refund or exchage i decided to just keep the other parts (Cap, Resist, and knob). Note-- the other Fender regular 500k pot was excellent. Have NO problems with the seller-- good to deal with!!	-1
The device works fine for reducing treble, covering the full range of a normal tone control in one half turn. But I cannot detect any effect at all when adjusting to cut the low end (the unit's only promised benefit). I watched a youtube video demo of a Strat having this control and also couldn't notice any change when trying to cut the low end. Perhaps this gadget is just a practical joke.  My unit also completely cuts off the signal when turned full clockwise. Perhaps it is defective. But it's not worth removing and returning.  Overall, this impulse buy was a total bust.	-1
Hm i guess this is why they call it a SCRATCH plate, because this thing looks like it was found at the bottom of a dumpster filled with sandpaper and nails. Ok maybe not THAT bad, but It is scratched all over the place and there's A LOT of wear around each of the drilled holes. Very poor quality control fender. My 5 year old cousin could have made a better pick guard out of a milk carton. Despite this, I'm gonna keep it since let's face it, it's gonna get scratched up anyways over time. In fact, if you're going for a relic look than this thing is perfect. I personally would expect some decent quality though from a piece of plastic i spent close to $20 on.	-1
bought for curiosity's sake. I can see why fender moved away from this scheme. adds a range of raspy sounds to an otherwise normal-ish tone control.	-1
Currently returning mine. The sound is very cloudy and not crisp at all. The RadioShack microphones I bought for 20 dollars over 5 years ago work better than this. And they have an on/off switch. Not happy!	-1
I have a Warmoth sporting a "Fender Vintage" bridge. These allegedly conform to Fender's specifications. This bridge doesn't fit. I'm thinking I *might* be able to bend it so it works, but if you want an easy to install bridge cover, this is not it.	-1
I have vintage fender custom with a authentic fender bridge. It didn't fit because e guess i don't have the VINTAGE FENDER BRIDGE. But i think it bulls*** that the product only fits certain bridges. Even the fact that mines is a vintage model guitar. Just avoid it.	-1
Useless. Will not fit my standard MIM Fender Strat. Way too big.	-1
I would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a Squier Bullet Strat, but the holes didn't line up, it didn't fit between the neck and the bridge, in fact, it was completely wrong. Nice quality though.	-1
This pickguard was used. It not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before.	-1
I'm just warning you guys, this thing smells toxic. It has that super cheap plastic strong odor. I tried airing it out in another room and it stunk up my living room. I then put it outside in the garage and it still stinks. I didn't send it back because I still want an amp cover when the amp leaves the house but be warned that if you sleep in the same house as this cover you will have two-headed babies. It also is not very thick but a cheap thin vinyl. I pretty much knew that would be the case before I bought it however. If I had to do it over again, I would buy my own material and then take it to a tailor. I am sure it won't cost much more than twenty bucks for someone to stitch you a square.	-1
Bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat. Doesn't fit perfect. Kinda bummed but oh well	-1
My biggest character flaw is thinking I'm can get something good for less money. That and I am gullible. DO NOT think you are going to get a mic that is as good as a Shure SM58 for $20. You can't. Don't believe the reviews, this mic is not in the same league as an SM58. It took me about 30 seconds after receiving the item to hook it up and realize this is not that good. I'm a slow learner, this is the third "just as good as the sm58" mic I've tried. None of them even come close. Save your money and buy the Shure, the is no substitute.	-1
worst mic ever. go with Gls es57. or a differen Pyle pro.... no joke. gave it to my kids as a toy. unable to use for recording. just awful. skip this or you'll be sorry. never worked	-1
Does not fit the strata caster pegs	-1
Stray ok but short for a full size guitar	-1
The strap you will receive will be different from what is shown in the picture. I wanted the thick-ended simple black straps and received the soft pointy ones - TWICE - after returning one strap and then purchasing another. I tipped Amazon's Customer Service on the phone about this and purchased a third set of 2 straps a few days later. Alas, although a little closer to what I needed, it was still different from what was on the picture.  For the price, I really can't complain much from that third set I got. I kept it. But Amazon really needs to pay attention to the details of what they are selling - and ship the correct item.	-1
Poorly made.  The back plate was thinner and smaller than my factory installed Squier back plate.  Flimsy.  The knobs lettering lacked the detail of my factory knobs.  Im surprised this is a genuine Fender product.  I specifically searched for Fender so I wouldnt get a cheap quality product.	-1
just right	-1
Not nearly as dark as the pictures represent. It reality it's a different shade of white.	-1
This kit seemed to have everything I was looking for, but the rear plate didn't fit my Strat - mine is inset, with a narrower profile than this one. The switch tip fell right off of my switch, so it's useless. Haven't figured out what to do with the whammy tip - it doesn't fit the 5mm bar I have. The knobs are okay, but somewhat cheap. I'm buying knurled aluminum knobs made by Ernie Ball instead. The pickup covers are the only parts I used from this kit.	-1
Product as described...  sort of.  Purchased to replace white parts for 2008 American Standard stratocaster.  The backplate did have a protective film on it, but it weighs significantly less than the original backplate which came with the guitar.  Completely different texture.  Cheaper, thinner, less dense plastic.  Selector switch has a visibly pronounced plastic seam.  The pickup covers and knobs are acceptable, but only because they aren't visible from any distance.  Fender would never use these parts on their flagship line of guitars.  I cannot comprehend why they would attach their name to such low quality replacement parts.	-1
Buttons itself are fine, however when I was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar (right above the thread). And I even pre-drill it. there is no way I can get it out :( so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it (now slightly off-center now)	-1
I've ordered two of these kits in the aged white, and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate. Literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor, accidentally stepped on them, and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale. The knobs, covers and tips are all in great shape, however.	-1
Unless you guys are receiving something I am not, how can you give this anything more than one star. My backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my Fender stratocaster. This is inexcusable. All the other Fender backplates I have have enough lip to cover the route, but not this mint green one. I simply cannot understand what Fender is thinking.  I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost.	-1
My problem I guess would be more with fender as a company. I bought this kit to put on a Fender Starcaster I just purchased and besides the knobs and trem cap nothing else even comes close to fitting. The poles on the pickups are much closer together than the holes in the covers, the toggle switch is cut much wider than the switch it came with so it falls right off, and the back plate is way smaller than the one that comes with the guitar. I just think it's really stupid the company makes an entry level strat that cannot be upgraded with simple parts. Guess that's what happens when you buy an outsourced guitar. From the sound of a few other reviews these also do not fit Squier guitars either. Even if everything did fit the parts just look like something you would get out of a cheap model car kit. You can see the notch where each part was cut from the mold. Not trying to be overly critical but I've seen higher quality molded plastic on mcdonalds toys. Guess the rest of this kit will just get thrown in the spare parts bin. Shame.	-1
I learned after ordering this mic that for some electronic reason it is not compatible with my Marshall guitar amp.  I was getting a lot of noise when the mic was plugged in, apparently because it is designed for voice over a PA system rather than an amp.  I returned it no problem and reordered a Shure SM57.	-1
Fender Genuine parts? I don't know, I guess they are made in China, really poor quality, the aged white ones of my Fender FSR Am Special Strat are much better than this black knobs, and they have some defects, probably is just bad luck, I recommend to purchase another brand, or another product presentation, this ones are uncertain quality parts.	-1
Not what we had expected. Good quality, but we need more accessories to make it really worth while.	-1
Need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) I have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently I needed and ordered some and I found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. Also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). Guess these are too cheap for Fender to have QC on.  Will try other brands next time.	-1
