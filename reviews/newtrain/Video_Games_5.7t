This is a wonderful and fast paced game. It is very difficult and almost as action packed as a Diablo game. This game takes a lot of strategy to beat and will keep you plugging away for months.	1
So far, IWD 2 is the best game out for 3rd Edition rules.  It also has some great quests and story elements as well as excellent voice acting on the part of NPC's and Player soundlists.(unlike most games these days). Some people are saying it is a hard game, but only if you let it be.  The "Favored Class" is not always a best choice for certain races.  For instance, Wild Elves are dumb as rocks and don't make good sorcerers because of thier lack of skills(arkana ect.) and thier normal human level charisma.(you can always multi-class them as rogues though)  Aasimars(if spelled right) make excellent sorcerers, however because of the 20 charisma(you can add points at higher levels). Give'em Snake's blood too.   On the Paladin of the Helm(one of my favorite classes) you can actually specialize in a wheapon like the bastard sword if you have gained four levels of Fighter.  Add to that focus on a Greatsword and sprinkle on Fiendslayer and Heritic's bane and you have a pretty powerful character who can heal and dish(more at dish) at phenominal rates.  What use is the fighter you ask, well, fighters gain feats more often(quite a bit more)than paladins and you don't have to pump points into charisma.(and they can be any alighnment) I usually have at least one fighter along with the Paladin and a Barbarian too.  For those of you who don't like Specializing Paladins, too friggen bad! That's your opinion and that's all it is.  I, for one hope the Helm rules remain. Onward The Helm!  Elven Clerics are as effective at fighting as Paladins(non Helm) but nooo! nobody is complaining about them.  That is another thing, an elevan Cleric will lesson your reload times as well, healing and dishing.  The rules are great, but you need loop-holes for creativity and that is what 3rd Ed has! Specifically, IWD2 is about goblin slaying,(my kindom for a shield dwarf!) but thier are more powerfull foes after Targos.  The sub-plotted quests are there, but not the pointless give the bag of sugar to the miller type like in Baldur's Gate and other games.  A guide can make your trip through areas much quicker if you ask for help in your arrand-boy stuff. If you want a good single player game with 3rd ED rules, this is it.  If you want to play with your next door neighbors(and across the street) this is perfect, if you want to chat about nothing with complete strangers all over the world, look elsewhere.  I rate this game and the 3RD ED rules ***** and nothing less.  3rd Edition Rules Rules! This review is for the Collector's Edition of Icewind Dale II which is escentially the same with some nice extra stuff and a CD with added gameplay elements.(The Sword of_insert your name here_ and others)	1
First, the character customization is excellent. I've created about 30 characters so far, though I'm only playing with 6 of them. The dungeons are fun. The items are awesome. The graphics are extremely good, and the music is phenomenal. The two main enemies are not cheesy; they certainly aren't up to the level of Jon Irenicus, but they don't have to be. This is hack n'slash, not "child of Bhaal's crisis". The voice acting is great. Warning: the battles get HARD around Chapter 3-4. They're tougher than any other Infinity engine game -- maybe any other CRPG, period -- nearly the whole way through, actually. But you'll get used to it. You really have to strategize, and winning is that much sweeter. Sure enemies occasionally pop up behind you, and you sometimes find yourself fighting 20 instead of 5. That's why you save. And in "real" life you wouldn't know exactly what was in that dangerous cave, no matter how much you explored it. (Would you walk around in platemail with an ambidextrous half-orc, a half-demon woman who could throw fireballs, and a moon worshiper who could RAISE THE DEAD in real life? If your answer is "yes", your life is more interesting than mine.) There are more towns than in the first Icewind Dale, but plan on spending your time fighting meanies in their horrible lairs. Your characters are as good as your imagination can make them. Balance your party carefully and you will win. If you're like me, and can't afford a new computer every year, a wonderful new game like this that doesn't need a[n expensive]video card and a gagillion MB of RAM is a godsend. If you're lucky enough to have that fancy new computer, you'll be able to run Icewind Dale II with lots of flash and dazzle. If you're not afraid of a challenge, get this game. When you win, you'll feel you've really accomplished something. Also, there are a lot of fan-created patches out there already that make the game a bit easier if you want to go that route.	1
By all rights, ICEWIND DALE II should not be nearly as addictive, as compelling, and as all-out entertaining as it is.  Consider: in an era where no game seems to have any hope of selling well unless it takes advantage of the most up-to-date 3D rendering technology, IDII employs old-fashioned handdrawn backgrounds and 2D animation.  While the market is dominated by flashy console RPGs with unsurpassed production values, IDII has nary a movie-like cutscene or in-game cinematic to be found.  And while the gaming zeitgeist is heavily slanted towards Japan, with exaggerated manga-style characters and a frenetic J-pop aesthetic, IDII soldiers on with the decades-old Dungeons & Dragons motif of dudes in fur hats and chainmail fighting monsters straight out of Tolkien. On paper, ICEWIND DALE II had no right to be so good  - but it is. The reason for this is that game has a number of secret weapons at its disposal.  First among these is BioWare's venerable Infinity Engine, which has powered game after brilliant game from BioWare and their prestigious licensee, Black Isle.  While showing its age in spots, especially in the lack of graphical flash, the engine has been polished and improved upon for over four years now (!), and in its last outing it has been honed into an almost perfectly intuitive interface for allowing players to guide their heroes through battle after battle while efficiently fielding the vast reams of statistical information that are part and parcel of anything having to do with D&D.  The interface takes up less of the game screen than ever before, and this, combined with the game's higher resolutions, allows players to see vast amounts of territory with a God's-eye-view and plan their strategies accordingly. The game features a host of new painted character portraits, all of which, with their brooding faces and evocative clothing, do a fabulous job of personalizing and humanizing the heroes you create, and most of which are simply excellent paintings in their own right.  (One quibble: it would have been nice, in the final Infinity Engine game, to have access to the by-now-vast gallery of portraits that have been created for the BALDUR'S GATE, ICEWIND DALE, and NEVERWINTER NIGHTS games - though, in truth, nothing is stopping the industrious player from importing those portraits into IDII himself.) The other major weapon in IDII's arsenal is the new and incalculably improved Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset, which is both more intuitive (having more armor gives you a bigger armor number, not a confusingly smaller one) and allows for infinitely more possibilities for character advancement: in D&D 2nd edition, the only truly significant choice you made was what class to start a character out as, and afterwards your party was more-or-less set in stone; whereas with the 3rd edition, you get so many options for skills and 'feats' (superpowers or extra abilities granted to characters) that, hypothetically, you can roll up six fighters who start out with not much in common with one another and end up with even less as they branch out into different specialties as the game progresses.  This diversity is the heart of the game's surprising replayability: it is highly unlikely, perhaps even impossible, for even the same player to generate heroes that have too much in common. Like the original ICEWIND DALE, this game is purely linear and almost strictly focused on combat, forsaking both the vast gameworld and indepth roleplaying of BALDUR'S GATE II and the intricate, puzzle-box story of PLANESCAPE TORMENT.  But ICEWIND DALE II does have a story, and it's a good one - taking you from the hoariest of cliched beginnings (monsters are menacing a town and six would-be heroes arrive Just In the Nick Of Time) to an epic and surprisingly emotional confrontation with a pair of villains who are far more interesting and complex than the usual run of mad wizards and homicidal warlords that litter the pages and screens of fantasy novels and video games.  Along the way, your characters solve old murders, bring peace to the unquiet dead, defend the defenseless, and right ancient wrongs...or not.  Whatever you do, the game shows you the consequences of your actions in ways both gratifying and surprising.  Dialogue is well-written, often sharply humorous, and occasionally even moving.  There's a lot of depth here for what many will dismiss as merely a 'hack and slash' game. Lastly, I want to give special commendation to the music, composed by Israeli musician Inon Zur.  Those who played THRONE OF BHAAL will recognize Zur's more exotic sound, which perfectly fit that game's more eastern-oriented setting, and although the soundtrack is a large departure from Jeremy Soule's more traditional Celtic-styled music from the first game, the new pieces do a superb job of getting you fired up to kill monsters.  (Although Soule's much-heralded theme music from the original game is back, though unfortunately minus the stirring horn section midway through.)	1
IceWind Dale II (IWD2), by Black Ilse Studios, is a worthy sequel to one of the best RPG games in recent memory. But while the original is a solid five stars plus, IWD2 pulls up a little short. Although for people with an imagination, it is still a very fun game -- and that's what RPG games are all about: IMAGINATION and FUN! Importantly, like the original IWD, IWD2 will enable you to effectively disconnect from the tedium and minutiae that can sometimes attend the work-a-day world, and allow you to find a place where Caesur-like, you can create a small band of mercenaries that can either 1) set right all that is wrong with the world or, 2) allow you to make your world more interesting through chaos and pandemonium. The choice is yours. Unlike the original though, the path to serious life on the razor's edge, laugh in the face of death battle, for good, neutral or evil characters, is lengthy -- realistically, almost two hours of real-time game-play. This is because IWD2 requires that you complete (sometimes onerous) tasks to level up to where you can actually be able to inflict some serious damage on the ne'er do wells within the game space. Once you get past these -- seriously unecessary -- tasks, the game takes off and the battles rage. Then again, that's why god created cheat codes -- use these effectively and this is not an issue. Net/net: 1) Serious escape value 2) Awesome ability to define character attributes and abilities 3) Programer's too prescriptive in designing the path to success 4) Highly imiginative spells, weapons and monsters/opponents 5) Give it a whirl and have some serious fun	1
On the surface, this game is basically similar to Baldur's Gate, BG II, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment: a Dungeons & Dragons game  focusing on a six-member party of adventurers.  Unlike its predecessors, it incorporates the 3rd edition D&D rules, which simplify gameplay and add some options for customizing your characters' abilities as they go up in level.  The 3rd edition rules work well here, and are an improvement over the previous games. Unfortunately, very much is wrong.  The first Icewind Dale was a simple, combat-oriented game--you just hacked your way from one obvious location to another.  This sequel has that element also, but has two glaring flaws.  First, the game is cheesy.  By this, I mean that monsters teleport to attack you from behind and the game prevents you from saving at numerous critical points--there are several multi-part battles where you can't save, and a misstep means you start the battle over from scratch. The second flaw is the focus on puzzle dungeons.  By this, I mean areas where you can't kill a monster unless you pull a series of levers in the right order and maps where going east puts you northwest of your previous location, and you can flail about endlessly unless one of your characters has an otherwise useless ability (Wilderness Lore).  Chapter 5 of the game (out of 6 chapters) is one big puzzle--and grotesquely annoying--dungeon, where you have to perform each step in a specific sequence--a sequence that is never revealed to you by the game.  (Even then, the problem is not that the puzzles are hard--they aren't--it's that they are so numerous and so ridiculous.  What kind of a ... villain would build all these puzzles in the first place?)  There are parts of this game that play more like Tomb Raider than D&D and, while I like Tomb Raider in its own genre, puzzle dungeons are more annoying than anything in a D&D game. A lesser flaw is the weakness of the story--the two enemies are simple bogeymen.  There is a part of the story which is, I guess, supposed to make you feel sorry for them, but the shades of morality here are far from grey.  The enemies simply have no personality, just lots (and lots) of spell effects they can summon instantly (bringing us back to the cheese problem). I consider myself a fairly hard-core player of D&D games on the PC.  I can't recommend this game to even players like me; for anyone just starting out in this type of game, stay far, far away.  Pick up Baldur's Gate or Baldur's Gate II if you want a pleasant introduction to D&D on the computer.	-1
Lots of people like to sing the praise of IWD2 and compare it to the BG series by the same company.  In this gamers opinion they are right, except that comparison consists mainly of what was WORST about BG.  Gone is the epic story.  Gone is the interesting interactions with NPCs in your party because the whole party is you (many enjoy this, I think it just promits the worst of hack-and-slash while destroying the fun interaction and saving the programers lots of time). What the game most has in comon with BG is the old unfortunate notion of the go fetch adventure that was BG's major shortcoming, to a large extent replaced in BG II.  What do I mean by fetch adeventure?  NPC: I need some wood, can you get it?, NPC: I can't  live without those bones, can you go find them?, NPC: Some toilet paper would really come in handy right now.  I am all out.  Be a dear and run to the store etc.  You get the idea.  The result is a game that is slow, two dimensinal, and a lot of time just walking between areas (another problem, that you cannot always walk right from one area to another and are left pacing through empty screens while your mind goes numb.) Clearly some people really love this game.  I don't get it and I am sorry that I did, buy it that is.	-1
...the old Bioware Infinity engine improves with time. The core system (graphics, animation, sounds, etc) might be 4 years old, but this game more than makes up for it. Icewind Dale 2 is a great sequel and it delivers on everything that it promised. All of the wisdom of the previous Infinity Engine D&D games has been poured into this game. In addition, there are a handful of improvements. If you can get over the outdated graphics, then this game is more than worth picking up. IWD2 uses the same real-time strategy setup as the other Infinity Engine D&D games. You have a party of up to 6 characters (unlike Neverwinter Nights), and you control them by giving them orders. Everything that you liked about the old games is still there. Great voice acting, the battle sounds (which now include taunts for a critical hit), great original music, an occasional dose of humor, cool spell effects, and lots of strategy. The Icewind Dale series is more combat-driven than Baldurs Gate and Planescape:Torment, and there is no "main character". But this game is NOT just a repeat if Icewind Dale 1. This game is better. For starters, there is MUCH more dialog and role-playing. The dialog trees are huge. NPC's react differently to you, depending upon who is talking to them. You can talk to one NPC with 3 different characters, and get 3 unique responses. An NPC might offer a quest only to a character who is of a certain class or race. Diplomacy and Bluff play a significant part in the game. The missions are more creative and interesting. The game has added a slightly new twist -- destructible objects, like barrels and doors, which makes for a few interesting problems to solve. There is one frantic scene where you have to battle across the screen quickly and stop some bad guys from demolishing a bridge (if you take too long, you fail). Some of your missions include destroying objects (a wall or a door, for instance).  In addition, IWD2 uses the 3rd Edition rules, and it is the best adaptation yet. Black Isle did a great job of incorporating the new rules and a few new races into the game, like the Aasimar and the Dark Elf. The game offers you more character variety than any D&D game to date, so it gives you the potential to replay the game (which is pretty long) a couple of times. I found this game to be somewhat harder than the other Infinity Engine games, but without getting too frustrating. If you are new to this genre, then I advise picking up Icewind Dale 1 or Baldurs Gate 2 first to get the feel of these games, because Icewind Dale 2 is VERY hard. The battles require more brainpower to get through, so the fun factor is very high. The AI has been upgraded - enemies come at you differently than they used too. Enemy spell casters are smarter and more dangerous. The goblins, orcs, and other minions come in big bunches, which gives you the feeling that you are truly taking on an army of the enemy. There isn't much to complain about in this game, except for the unfixable shortcomings of the old engine. The graphics and animation are getting very outdated, and some of the other little flaws like pathfinding are still there. The story is linear, and the game is still combat-oriented. However, you can look past those flaws to see a great game. This is the best D&D 3rd Edition game out there yet. Black Isle squeezed that old Infinity engine like an orange and got every last drop of fun that they could out of it.	1
I was somewhat pleased with Icewind Dale; due to a few issues I had with the game, I thought myself through with Black Isle Studios, but upon hearing about the release of their sequel Icewind Dale 2, and their implementing 3rd Edition D&D rules I decided to give it another shot. BIS has modified the Infinity Engine to accomodate the 3E rules, including the Half-Orc and the special new playable races, like Drow, Aasimar and the new Forgotten Realms races, like the Gold Dwarf and the Strongheart Halfling. All standard races and classes are also available including the new Barbarian and Sorcerer, with the return of the Monk (from 1st Edition). Multiclassing is now a BIG breath of fresh air, easier to handle and much more enjoyable, but you are limited in some ways, depending on which class you pick. Among the best is a Rogue/Monk (Monk of the Broken Order) multiclass; this limits your alignment choice, but offers powerful combinations in combat like the Monk's stunning attack and the Rogue's sneak attack, not to mention the additional AC bonus from a positive wisdom modifier. The interface is similar to the original game, but has been streamlined and reorganized. Veterans to previous Infinity Engine games will be at home with the familiar controls. All eleven classes are available, and character creation is faster due to the point buy method for generating ability scores; this seems to be the method of choice in 3E CRPGs for gamers who want to create their parties quickly, but I miss the dice roll method. Dice rolling is most likely less popular and tedious, hence the switch to point buy; I'd like to see a choice of methods in creating ability scores in the next one! It has a great in-game help system with info for everything from the new races and classes to the exciting new feats, skills and their prerequisites. Great for reference and new players. The character record is wonderful, your list of skills/feats, your attack modifiers, and other info at the touch of a button. A few new portraits are available, but more could have been included, and all the original character voices were included from the original IWD and Heart of Winter (plus a few new ones). Gameplay is essentially the same, especially the real-time combat; I prefer turn-based combat, but the pause function makes fighting more manageable and is an interesting change. This helps when you need to cast spells or use one of the new skills or feats from the special abilities button. Moving around seems more tricky; sometimes a character will go a different way than the party or will be stuck somewhere, but the pathfinding can be adjusted through the configuration menu in Windows. When you're not in combat, you'll be spending most of your time talking to others for quests, running errands and using your skills to gain special rewards. A bit more role-playing and strategy is involved here and the combination of all these elements is what makes IW2 fun to play. Graphics are the same as in the first IWD, pleasing to fans of the game, but some might be disappointed in the lack of more 3D and graphic improvements. Spell selection is excellent, along with an impressive bestiary. I love the ambient sounds heard in the background; it makes the world seem more alive and realistic, and the music is the best. If you were fortunate enough to get the Adventure Pack or the Collector's edition, you'll get bonus items in both standard and Heart of Fury mode, including the game's beautiful soundtrack. The rulebook is very small, unfortunately, reading these small words makes it hard on the eyes if not read in bright light. Right-clicking on the map when you click the Area Map allows you to add area notes, but this was not documented in the rulebook. The hide bonus has been excluded from the small races except the Deep Gnome. These are just minor grievances, though. Despite its slightly dated engine and minimal problems, Icewind Dale 2 is an engaging and enjoyable romp through a living, breathing world, sure to ruin your social life and guarantee bags under your eyes from lack of sleep, and is one of the best utilizations of the 3E rules I've seen in a D&D computer role-playing game.	1
Aggressive Inline for Nintendo Gamecube is a Tony Hawk/Dave Mirra clone on rollerblades. Now, just because most of the Tony Hawk clones on the game market haven't lived up to their expectations, Aggressive Inline does. The Gamecube version was released in August 2002, when the Playstation2 version was released in May 2002. This delay is for improving the software. If you place two televisions, one with a Playstation2 playing this, and a Gamecube playing it, you can notice the difference. The Gamecube supports Progressive Scan with the compatible televisions. The Gamecube has stronger hardware, allowing Z-Axis, (the producing company) to push the envolope farther. The Gamecube uses more polygons on the characters than the Playstation2 does. There is progressive mapping too. The only thing against the Gamecube version is that the Xbox also has this game. There is only 7 levels to skate in. But that's no problem, because these levels are the largest levels you will see in a while. The Xbox boasts a whole new level, unavailable on the Playstation2 and Gamecube. The Xbox also features a customizable soundtrack, because CD tracks can be burned on the hard drive. No big deal, because Aggessive Inline has a excellent soundtrack. The controls of Aggressive Inline will be a little hard if you haven't played Dave Mirra or Tony Hawk. The A Button is used for ollieing (jumping for the skating impared), B button is for grabs, X Button is for modifying, Y button is used for grinding, L and R are used for rotations, and the Z button is used for the cess slide, similar to the revert in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. The Z button is pretty far away from the R button, because I find it discomfarting to keep taking my index finger off the R trigger to press the stiff Z button. But, after a while, it becomes second nature. To conclude, Aggressive Inline is grinding it's way on to shelves August 6th, 2002, and you should pick this title right away. If you don't believe me, check the reviews!

i played this game for ps2 at my friends house and it was amazing. then i went home to look at some pics and moves of this game for gcn and they were way better than the ps2 one looks and if the gameplay is as good as the ps2 version this game will be a huge hit.	1
On the past E3, gamers played many extreme sports games including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 and Aggressive Inline. They wrote on previews and news that the best extreme sport they had played was Aggressive Inline. It is really hard for a customer to believe in this, but it is true! Personally I don't think this game could win against Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. The tricks you can do on inline-skates are very limited and very similar to the skateboard ones. I saw some few movies on this game and I didn't like it's look. But I guess you should trust on the gamers who really play it. ..Overall, I don't know if the game is good or bad, but what i do know is that it can't beat Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4!	1
If you have star wars galactic battlegrounds and are tired of the same thing you shoukd buy this pack first of all you have new reserch upgrades also new mechs and troops also 2 new civilazations galatic republic and the confederacy. some examples of some of the improvements are you can make controlable predeters (only confederacy can do this) see in episode 2 the stadium battle sequence. also you can make power droids to move where power is needed also a major imporvement is the now ship you can make at the fortresses these ship a super powerful and count as 2 persons on you soilder count they destroy every ground troop within a certian area including you own troop so be careful also they balanced the game more so certan troops are less effective then they were in the frist bounty hunters don't kill jedi as easy and air craft don't kill anti aircraft troop as easy. some down fall about this game is it still takes about 3 hr to finsh a skermish also I thought it would be more new thing than it really has but all in all its a solid expansion and it worth your money if you are a fan of the first so I give it 5 stars.	1
I'm content with this expansion pack. The republic are a fun civilization to play especially with the tech 4 upgrades. They added some great new upgrades and research for exisiting armies including power droids. The new Fortress armies caught me off guard at first because of thier sheer destructive power, but i got use to them. Enough bang for the buck to get me back into playing the game and having fun doing it. The new Star Wars locales are fun to play and entertain. After reading the instruction manual for the game and reading what's been added and changed, it made the game a lot more fun. It's a good expansion for your bucks, if your a fan of Episode 2 as well as the original Galactic Battlegrounds. Just the fact that AT-AT's can now fire at air targets as well as ground targets make it almost worth it alone. Hope to see another expansion with a lot more civilizations. Maybe for Episode 3 ??? Like Starcraft - Brood War i have yet to go back to playing the original game, this is much more fun.	1
I have many reasons to give this a good rating, because it left me with no doubt in my mind about what I thought of it. I just recently seen Episode 2, and after I saw it, I wanted a game related to it. Since all Star Wars Episode 2 games weren't due out for a few months, I settled for Galactic Battlegrounds and Clone Campaigns. I was on a macho powertrip about how cool it would be to control the Clone troopers in real-time tactics after the bad-to-the-bone performance they gave in the movie. I played it and realized that to control your team, you actually have to think as if you were one of them, you could not just run in and take out every enemy, you had to think. It gives you 14 new levels, 2 new civilazations... The Republic and the Confederacy with new upgrades and buildings. It is chock full of Episode 2 content from the Clones to appearances by Obi-Wan and Jango-Fett plus Vehicles such as the Jedi Starfighter and the Slave 1. This is one of the only expansions this side of Diablo 2 where you get the most bang for your buck.	1
Great graphics, easy to use directions and setup, lots of episodes. You can create your own storyboard and set levels of difficulity.	1
The expansion to Galactic Battlegrounds was an improvement. The gameplay, additional sounds and the new civilizations make it worth the buy. I play this game online a few hours everyday, so you could say I find it pretty addicting. It really isn't a bad game at all.	1
I thought that this was a pretty cool expansion pack for an already cool game. You get 2 more campaigns covering 14 total missions. With more units, buildings, and upgrades available, this game is getting better and better. A few of the campaigns are pretty tough, especially getting started which makes for some pretty long battles. The only real bad thing about this game and the expansion is how weak the air units are. If you have a couple of anit air turretts built, you can take out 8 or 10 air units pretty easy without losing a turrett. And for the expense of building air units, it just isn't worth it. Other than that, this is a very solid game with good graphics and some pretty awesome battles. I recommend this all RTS fans. To me, this is the best computer game based on Star Wars.	1
A team of ewoks haha. Maybe they can win by the other team being sympathetic by the ewoks throwing pebbles at them.	1
I'm gonna keep this short and to the point. Clone Campaigns is a 100% improvement over Galactic Battlegrounds. If you at all liked Battlegrounds then this is not even an option, it's a must.	1
If you like real time strategy games and you're a Star Wars fan, you've probably purchased Galactic Battlegrounds... and IF you have watched Episode II and are still hooked on it, then this is a "must have" too for you... This is an awesome expansion pack for Battlegrounds! Featuring news units from the movie (Confederate and Republican) and two new campaigns. Were you wondering what had happened after Dooku's escape from Geonosis? I strongly reccomend it for Star Wars fans, Real time players and anyone who wants to have fun without taking too long the grasp the basics...	1
After extensively spending some time with the E3 build, I have to admit that I am quite impressed. The graphical system is pretty good, especially for a handhled system. I really have a lot of respect for a near-perfect port of the Playstation original. A nice variety of WWII weapons are present, and they are fairly easy to aim and use. There are also quite a few levels that are really large in size, which is very surprising for the Game Boy Advance. Also, the game is better than Doom, as it is more realistic and the enemies are much easier to see. Unfortanutley, it is just too damn dark. The Game Boy Advance is not backlit, and this just reminds of that. It is also a port of the Playstation game. Medal of Honor: Underground lacks the polish of the original and the new additions found in the Playstation 2 game, Medal of Honor Frontline. Environments are bland, and enimies can sometimes be too tough. There is never enough ammunition, either. However, this game is eaisly the best first-person shooter to grace the Game Boy Advance. It is more realistic than Doom, longer than Ecks Versus Server, and is much easier to navigate than the bloody tradedgy that was Wolfstein 3D. This game is good stuff, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who feels like murduring some of those damn, virtual, Nazis. Damn fine. Damn, Damned, fine.	1
This game is GARBAGE. Avoid it at all cost. It's the biggest piece of @#$% I've ever had to play. and it's too bad because to the true MOH fan it would have been a nice take along but it's more of a leave behind.	-1
Medal of Honor: Underground is the eleven best (second to the worst) FPS for GBA and the ninth released for the system.  Medal of Honor: Underground looked promising for the GBA because the PS One version was so good.  When I turned on the game I thought it wasn't so bad.  Cut me some slack, I'm only reading the mission briefing!  After I was done reading, the game started.  What the heck am I looking at?  These graphics are horrible, some of the worst I've seen on GBA.  I liked how the other reviewer worded it, It was like sticking a turd in your Game Boy cartridge slot and flipping the on switch!  That's pretty much the only way I can describe how bad the graphics are!  After a while you get used to the chunky graphics and sluggish control and realize, okay, it's not that bad.  The game features a good story, neat cut-scenes and varied objectives.  This gives it more depth than the garden-variety shooter, ahem . . . Doom.  This is definitly one of the worst FPSs for the GBA.  Beware of the graphics!	-1
I'll have to agree with John Wolf, honestly. For what Destination had to work with, I think they did an admirable job with MOHU. Admittedly, for it being a Playstion game originally, MOHU was an ambitious undertaking yet Destination did fine with it...and, in my opinion, is definitely a worthy FPS worth owning for the Gameboy Advance. Sure, it may not be as polished and innovative as some other FPS for the system but it holds its' own and, for that, they should be commended. I'll admit, I'm a diehard-hardcore Medal of Honor fan myself. It wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, either. That's, probably, why so many are disappointed with the game. But, Reviewer John Wolf is right with what he said in his review. Medal of Honor:Underground isn't that bad of a game. It should be given a chance.	1
With a 32-bit processor and up to 250MB of storage space there is only so much Destination software could do with this game.  For what they did do, they did a good job of. This game is not as sophisticated as the versions for the Playstation and this is one of the reasons why many people seem disappointed with this game.  Eventually game companies may be able to fit a DVD's worth of data on a small GBA chip, but not today.  This game has impressive graphics for a portable and very realistic sounds.  It does not play well in not perfect lightening conditions, and I would not recommend you use a Game Boy external light.	1
I have gotten my hands on the beta by a fellow member of my hotline server. He gave me the first official beta of the game, and now, after writing one review, I am here to tell you about the beta. First to start out with, the graphics are outstanding. Don't expect them to be even close to Doom 3, but they are great! Very nice details, and outdoor terains look great for just the beta! The controls are great and the response is superb. The music is a bit annoying after a while (it plays techno music repeatively over and over again over the sound effects). They will probably do something about this in the real release of the game. The physics are the best part of this game, to my opinion. You never die the same way twice. It is that good! The guns have different effects in different ways. For example, the shock rifle goes for a pushing motion, thus having the victim being thrown to the floor, and then blown into bits. The lightning gun, though, goes for limb removal. If you hit the victim in the arm, he will have no more arm! You shoot him more after he's dead you will find the body parts flying everywhere, one by one. The assault rifle, riddles tiny wholes in the body, making guts and blood go everywhere. Now, remember folks, that this is 5 stars for the beta. If the beta was this enjoyable, you can expect the game to be even better on release. I can not take away credit for any of the down sides, for that is what a beta is for. The AI was acceptional, but remember that this is a beta. There is no multiplayer, so I can not give you the info on that. The other complaints I have had about this game is that the same voices are in this game. You will hear the male one, male two, (and that is it in the beta), just as they were in UT. UT's voices were great, but they need to change. UT2003 has been what I have expected. It was a great joyride to senseless violence land. It will suck precious hours away from my life like the previous version did.	1
After how well URT did a few years ago, this game has a lot to live up to. And I'm betting it does. The graphics look incredible! (By the way if you don't have a 64MB or higher video card I suggest you buy one before you buy this game because you won't be able to play it)	1
UT was probably if not THE BEST, one of the best games of the year. It had jaw-droppping graphics, superb gameplay, and excelent, diverese weapons. Unreal Tournament 2003 is going to be excelent. UT2003 is going to have BETTER graphics (and boy do I mean better), BETTER gameplay, and BETTER weapons (same weapons but some of them modified and others are totally new... They might even have grenades that you can through, unlike its predecessor). New graphics engines will come into play with UT2003. There will be a new physics engine and a new engine called Skeletal Animation, which animates every single different bone in your body, and not just the whole body itself. By that, I mean that instead of the body moving while running, the arms, legs, and whatever else needed to run will be animated. In most games, only the body is animated when running. In UT2003, we should see people's heads moving if they are looking behind their shoulders, or see their legs bend and fly before they jump. The new physics engine will be a great addition to the game. Almost like Soldier of Fortune, it has a great physics engine so that you never die the same way twice. If a rocket comes at your left leg, your leg gets blown off, and thats it. If you get shot by a plasma rifle, then you will go flying into a wall, and then fall down. If you get shot in the side by a sniper rifle, you will fall down to the side. I also have heard that if you fake your death (Please tell me alteast ONE MAJOR UT FAN KNOWS YOU CAN FAKE YOUR DEATH BY PRESSING THE <F> KEY!), you can get stepped on, and if you get stepped on enough, you will lose all of your heatlth and die, a great new feature (haha). Well, UT2003 looks like it will suck me into senceless violence land again infront of my computer, just as UT did. UT2003 is a must buy, for all computer gamers alike. Regardless if you move tanks across pixels, or if you move your troll around in dungeons, or even if you manage a family or house, UT2003 is for you!	1
The game itself is very similar to the original Unreal Tournament in gameplay, meaning it'll still have single-player, deathmatch, and team-based levels.  Many of the current weapons from the original game will also be included here.  However, the graphics of the environments, characters, and even the weapons have been remarkably improved. The environments in particular have taken a major facelift.  Indoor arenas still look cramped and mechanical as if you're in the middle of some robotic manufacturing plant.  The pipes on the walls jut out prominently and grills and steam vents are everywhere.  All in all much more detailed and realistic looking.  The outdoor environments are particularly nice with a combination of grassy and rocky hillsides, detailed trees and waterfalls.  Even running into dense brush will make blades of tall grass obscure your view.  It was interesting to see this combination of nature and machinery as players access mechanical elevator platforms at the base of a hillside.  In another level, players could blast away at each other inside and outside a snow-covered city in the middle of a blizzard.  Another level took place high up among a large forest, something you might see in Lord of the Rings or Everquest. A demo of the terrain editor showed how users can easily build terrain.  Think of an outdoor environment being a multiple of layers.  The first is solid rock, the second is the rocky surface that adds texture, and the third layer is the grassy surface.  Users can easily select a layer and simply paint the environment as they see fit. The creators have focused strongly on balancing the weapons based on feedback from the user community (of course they always say that, right?)  For instance, it'll be much more difficult to camp in a corner and snipe away as the gun now shoots a bolt of electricity, making it much easier to tell where the camper's at.  The rocket launcher seems relatively unchanged, however shooting three rockets at one time leaves some really nice trails.  The ripper disappears this time around (did anyone ever use this anyway?) and is replaced with a new gun that can power up a shield in front of the player that'll absorb damage for a brief period of time.  The way around this is to shoot something behind the player.  Instead of the flak gun spraying shrapnel, it now shoots a canister that explodes in flak (might help to get that guy with the shield on).  Another gun (the goop gun perhaps?) seemed to give off its own light which served to illuminate dark areas and was a nice lighting effect.  The drawback, of course, is it could probably give away your position too.  The minigun returns (with exploding bullets), and the shock rifle also sends out an exploding ball of energy which could prove devastating in cramped quarters, but the slow movement will probably render it ineffective in a large outdoor environment.  The Redeemer is scheduled to return, but it was still in development.  Finally, the pulse rifle shoots really nice looking streams of blue electricity at the player that's surprisingly reminiscent of the weapons in the movie Ghostbusters.  Word has it teams can also combine their energy streams for even greater impact.  Hmmm... wonder where they got that idea from? Mods and mutators will be included in this version which, unfortunately, leaves the door open for invincibility cheats and other hacks, but the developers felt the door needed to be left open for us to create our own improvements.  All in all, the gameplay remains much the same (good!) but it'll be an all new look and feel and I'm sure current UT fans will love it.	1
Great Game! I do recommend this game then Call Of Duty and Battlefield this game is definitely better then Cal Of Duty.	1
This was good fun and had some really nice mods going that never ported to UT2K. I still fire it up occasionally for the dark mods.	1
I Have broadband connection with a 1.2 AMD pc powered by  a radeon 9600 graphic card and the game sometimes lags. Others times when I enter a room a black screen shows up giving a percentage of how long it will take to enter a room and sometime its take up to 2o minutes. Thats a long time even with dsl. I am newly introduced to the series so it will take me a while to get the hang of the multiplayer experience and the game in general. Other than that the game is fun to play. I recommend your get unreal 2004, but you should have a descent computer with a powerful graphics card. oh yeah if you don't have dsl don't bother playing online.	1
This game is great man. I just got it and I'm totally hooked on it. This is the first game ever to make me uninstall Counter Strike. My hard drive is sadly only 40gb for my newest gig and I had to uninstall Counter Strike to install this game. I first tried the demo which takes only about 200mb of my hard drive and I bought the full verision which was larger and forced me to uninstall CS. I won't say much because you probably tried the demo or already played the full version before so you know that it is good. some people said get Unreal Tournament 2004 instead but this game is about the same. UT2k4 only has few more maps, more vehicles, and the new Onslught mode. If you already have UT2K3, then you can stick to it for another year. Not only that, there are many great mods and you will definitly like it. Sorry if this review was waste of your time but you should still get this game.	1
The original unreal tournament is the very definition of fun. It was interesting, and I could play the demo for hours without becoming bored. The game remained interesting with cool characters, maps, and weapons. Then they released new maps, mods(relics in particular), and assault mode. That game was a success. Unreal Tournament 2003 changes the original into a lame game. There are all new guns, and worst of all... There are uninspired new maps. The new 2-fort is a sand like level that doesn't have the same feeling. The other maps just don't have anything to be talked about. The all new guns I mentioned? Crap. They all blow except the redeemer. The new sniper rifle(lighting gun!) is retarded. The new pistol is pretty stupid. There's also a gun now which instead of doing damage, it pushes the opponent. This is rather useless in pretty much any situation. If you are on the top of a tower it is good, but that is rare. Get the original Unreal Tournament or Unreal Tournament 2004. They both rock, and this game can just be skipped.	-1
When I purchased a computer system in November 2000 to upgrade my aging PC, a game title I had in mind was Unreal Tournament (UT).  After spending just a short while with UT, I realized it was a winner.  This game defined the clich "thrill of victory and agony of defeat."  I was almost afraid to play it because I hated to lose, but was it great to win!  Playing Unreal Tournament set the stage for Unreal Tournament 2003 (UT2003), but progress does not always fulfill one's hopes. UT2003 is a good shooter.  It is a very good looking game with realistic effects like fire, swirling clouds, and rounded surfaces.  It's rendering of shiny metal objects is perhaps the best I've seen in any game.  The bots work well in single player, and the AI has been improved so much over UT that it's almost impossible to beat the bots in the tougher difficulty settings (at least I couldn't).  The sound and music are good too. The drawbacks of UT2003 include fairly high system requirements.  I could run it on my Pentium III system, but the frame rates noticeably dropped when a lot of bots were on screen.  Even on my 3 GHz Pentium IV system the game will sometimes slow down noticeably.  Also, I thought that the weapons weren't as good as in UT.  The sniper rifle, one of the best weapons I've seen in any game, was replaced by a "lightning gun."  I hate this weapon!  You've got to wait several seconds for it to recharge, and we all know what waiting results in when we are being attacked by bots or players intent on killing us. UT2003 and Unreal II, just aren't what they could be, and they are a step down from their predecessors.  I would love to see the developers of these Unreal games return to their roots.  Give us the original greats like Unreal and Unreal Tournament with updated sound and graphics, and you'll have a lot of happy players.  Epic Megagames, do you hear me?	1
Let me start this review by stating that I'm a fairly finicky gamer. I disliked Half Life: Counter Strike, immensely enjoyed the No One Lives Forever games, and was disappointed by Unreal 2 (though the game had its good merits). As much as I loved the first Unreal Tournament, after spending some quality time with UT2003, I can honestly say that this game is truly... better. Some people disliked the game because it was too demanding of their systems. This is bull. The engine is refined. A GeForce 3 Ti card on a system with no bottlenecks will run this game smoothly with moderate visual settings, but a GeForce 3 coupled with a 1Ghz proc. is expectedly slow. Why? Because as textures are bump mapped, when volumetric fog is thrown about the maps like candy, and when the poly counts are through the bloody roof, the DEVELOPER EXPECTS PEOPLE WITH DECENT SPECS TO PICK UP THE GAME. Don't cry when your ancient rig can't hang with the new big boys.  Get a 9800 Pro or something and see what you're truly missing. Although it is easy to be disappointed with UT2003 when you find your favorite sniping rifle or map has been removed or modified, most players will begin to appreciate the near perfect balancing scheme Digital Extremes put into place.  There are no overpowering weapons dominating the field.  New game modes like the insanely intense Bombing Run replace the game mode stripped from the original.  The addition of the double jump imposes players with addictive, arcade-feel action... causing firefights to last for minutes, not moments.  Realism isn't the deal here.  Fun is. In conclusion, Unreal Tournament 2003 has an insane amount of content right out of the box.  The Unreal platform is fast, beautiful, updated, hip, and stable.  If you have the paltry fee required to purchase this game, then do so.  I think you'll be happy.	1
Unreal 2003 kicks butt.  It's fun and looks fabulous and the online play is superb, however because of the framerate issue(s) I've got to knock this one back one star.  If the video on this game was as solid like the classic game or like Quake III I'd have to give this one a five star rating.	1
Epic Megagames have really jumped the boat since their heydays, but they were very lucky with Unreal and Unreal Tournament. Both were fantastic and simple games to play which hearld back to the days of DOOM. Now with Unreal Tournament 2003 you get improved graphics and lots of added features from the original game. Strange thing is though, when I started playing the game I thought I was playing the original. The graphics may look prettier but I didn't notice them, neither did I care about the new skins either, this is a shoot it if it moves type of game you don't have time to look at the pretty pictures, you've got to keep moving and that's why this game fails because basically the gameplay is the same as the first game. A huge, but expected, disappointment from this once great game developer.  Unreal Tournament 2004 is coming soon and it looks like it's jumping on the GTA bandwagon by adding vechiles for you to control. I'd say wait for that one, but if you can't wait buy the original Unreal Tournament, it's cheaper and it won't need a powerful computer, UT2003 is a joke.	-1
Unreal Tournament 2003 is not as good as the orginal UT. But it is a great game with Excellent level design, graphics, weapon balance, gameplay modes, bot AI and mutliplayer modes with great physics. Just like the first game UT2003 is one of those games that really make the wasted hours, the lost sleep and the money spent upgrading hardware. In the single player game, you can play in Tournament mode. This is a perfect introduction if you're a new player, and if you are an experienced gamer, this mode is useful as a quick tour of the game's maps. Not many changes and needs a powerhouse system but if you are a fan of Quake3 or the orginal Unreal Tournament then Unreal Tournament 2003 is definitely for you.	1
I've been a big fan of the original Unreal Tournament since I bought it, and I wanted to get this one when it came out but I knew my computer wouldn't be able to handle it. But now, i just bought myself a new computer and Unreal Tournament 2003 was the first new game I bought for it. I can run it at max everything on my system (3.0 GHz Pentium 4 Processor, 1024 mb RAM, 128 mb RADEON 9800 Pro Graphics Card) and the graphics are just stunning. The way the bodies move when you kill someone is extremely realistic. There are some Bombing Run levels where your goal is suspended above a pit with obstacles on the way down, and I often spend some time during the game just jumping into the pit to watch myself die. Very cool. The gameplay is very fast paced and intense. There's no Assault more anymore, but there is the new Bombing Run mode which is very addictive, and there are also tons more gametypes available for download. There aren't really any new weapons, but the old ones are awesome in this game, especially the flak cannon. All in all I think this game is better than the original UT. Very addictive single and multi-player experience.	1
Unreal Tournament 2003 is the sequel to a fabulous game, Unreal Tournament. Unfortunately, Unreal Tournament isn't as ground-breaking and as great as its predecessor, but it is still a good game. Epic Games/Infoframes decided to take a sports approach to the revived version of Unreal Tournament which made me skeptical about the game initially. As I predicted, this new approach was its downfall. First, let us discuss the graphics and physics. Quite frankly, they are stunning. The Unreal engine is most definitely the best graphics engine out there, and delivers the best graphics I've seen. The physics are also great. The damage modeling kits are almost perfected, as arms fly off when hit there. A blast from a flak cannon will leave just a torso, which is satisfying to blood-thirsty gamers like myself. Bodies will bounce on the ground when dead, which gives a realistic feel as opposed to the bodies being stiff as a board. The sound is one of the worst aspects of the game. Since the game is taking a sports approach, there is an in-game announcer. After the first few battles, he annoyed me so much, I was forced to off the sound, and play some of my music. Also, when a teammate tries to send you a voice message, its hard to tell who it was from. This is because of the sloppy game interface (or HUD). Nothing is labeled, and it takes a while to get used to it. The game is pretty much squad-based deathmatch, so you aren't expecting revolutionary gameplay, but after beating the single-player game in (and I'm not kidding) in just 3 hours, you are left with somewhat monotonous skirmishes/multiplayer modes. Despite its shallow gameplay and other problems, it (for some reason) is a good game, and satisfied me.	1
I bought this wondering what the hype was all about.  The weapons were all lame.  This game is nothing compared to its similar games like Counter-Strike or Quake 2. Cons: 1)Multiplayer offers tremendous lag even on a T3 line and DSL line.  I have a Pentium 4 with geforce 2 and great connection and plenty of RAM to burn.  This game was so lagged it was no fun to play.  Just like Q3 it was unplayable because it lagged so much.  It even lagged when I played single player against the computer. 2)The game has super lame weapons. 3)No thought or original game play. Pros: 1)Great graphics 2)Beautiful maps	-1
They did it again with the newest iteration of UT - Graphics are outstanding, sounds are outstanding, and overall its just fun to play (THE only game to keep me up beyond 2am playing!) Why is it so good? FPS DM/CtF type games are a proven winner, this one takes it to the next level. Speaking of levels, you'll find plenty in this one- enough to keep you busy for quite a while. Something that made the first UT so good are the people out there who write mods for the game- you will find such people for UT2K3 as well, these provide you with some very interesting changes in the game; assuring that you will not get tired of Unreal Tournament 2003 for quite a few days (months? years? milleniums?) Overall, this game was done *perfectly* in my sight- the ai and weaponrly seems balanced, there is just nothing i could think of that would make the game any better. If i could give it 6 stars I would. Enjoy Unreal Tournament 2003 - it's money you won't regret spending.	1
I like this game..I've noticed a lot of the reviewers here didn't like it but let me make a few things clear. This game's strength lies in its multiplayer, the single player couldn't hold my interst, I had the most fun playing on servers with new and unusual maps and mutators. Don't even bother with the campain unless your learning how to play, go for the instant action mode its much more fun without the pressure of having to win to advance.  Even so the instant action is more practice than anything. The graphics are amazing, if you have a relatively high end system you can run it with max everything with pretty much no slowdown.  Also for the most fun you should have a broadband connection. While this game probly isn't nearly as good a the orignal, open up a few new mods and you can have lots of fun. have a slow comp and narrowband??? Don't bother.	1
Unreal Tournament 2003 is a fast-paced FPS and is loosely a sequel to the original that belonds to the 'Break things and kill people' genre. All in all, it's a good game, but I was disappointed about a few things. For one, 'Assault' has been removed. Assault was my favorite game mode. Why they took it out, I don't know, but I hope it's put back in some form. A few of my old favorite weapons are gone. I was very disappointed that- of all things- the Defenders were removed! Even as a starting weapon, double Defenders were decent sidearms. Running around with akimbo pistols was just so cool, and the new Assault Rifle loses some of that 'coolness' factor. After all, breaking stuff and killing people- and looking cool while doing it- is one of the big factors of these games, right? I also miss the old sniper rifle. I can't get the hang of the lightning gun... maybe I just really, really stink. :) The old sniper was a lot easier to get used to, I think. Plus, it's a lot easier to snipe when your position isn't given away by a huge freakin' beam of electricity. :D (Yeah yeah, pros and cons to a weapon, I know.) Let's just say it's less newbie-friendly- this is a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. To cap off the negative points, Bombing Run- while a breath of fresh air to the category- is not quite...polished. I'm not sure what is really wrong with it- it's a creative idea, but not as well executed as it could be. Now to stop ranting. :) It's a beautiful game thats been improved in many ways, but remains true to the original with the Unreal Tournament flair. UT2k3 is just as addicting as the original. Everyone keeps complaining about the announcer, but I don't see the problem- I leave him on. So if you enjoy fast-paced action pitting a bunch of players against each other to see who can rack up the highest body count, (exhale-inhale) I would say UT2k3 is a staple in any serious gamer's collection. There are a lot of differing opinions about it- I'd say just check it out for yourself, it might be your 'thing' and it might not.	1
This game isn't as fun as good-looking, but it's still an incredible ride to play! The graphics are the center stage in this title. If you have a high-performance PC, the graphics are breathtaking! From the scenery to the smallest details, Unreal 2003 looks great! The sound is good, with the music being the best. Otherwise, the players become repetitive and the announcer is just plain annoying to hear. TURN HIM OFF!! The conrol scheme is typical, and movement is the same as most other PC first-person shooter titles out there, which is good. As for characters, the aliens are corny, the robots are too human, and the geneboosted humans you love to hate! The real surprise lies after beating the Single Player mode, and getting Malcolm, Brock, and Lauren. The fun part of the game is just killing and killing sprees! The downside is repetition. Of course, the game doesn't really get old with all the environments and characters to play as. Overall, get the game just for the beautiful graphics and levels. You'll feel like you are really travelling from planet to planet and space station to space station!	1
This is probably the best game I have played in a while. The graphics are jaw dropping and the new gameplay functions make this one of the best games out. It didn't have as many maps as the first one and the player options weren't as customizable, but I thought the bot AI is way better and so are the weapons. This is a must have for all those First-person gamers, or just anyone looking for some very fast paced combat. WARNING: If you don't have a computer that has over 1 GHz of processing power and a GeForce 2 or higher this is not for you.	1
If you liked the first UT, then you might not want to play this just yet.  Give yourself some time to forget what an awesome game the first one was.  UT2003 is not a bad game by any means, but it doesn't have the flavor that the original UT had. I think that the graphics in UT2003 are just amazing and the physics are great too.  When a person is killed there are numerous different ways that the character falls or explodes.  Also there is a good supply of various characters to choose from; my favorites being the Egyptians. I give this game four stars because they did a very good job designing it but lost the feel of the original UT.  If they didn't try to spice it up so much and have all the voices grunting or yelling, then I would have given it a five.	1
Think of Unreal Tournament 2003 as a great-graphics weapon fest. As a first person shooter it has an OK single player mission series, but the game really shines in its on line tournament play. Yes, there is a single player mode. You go around shooting things, learning about the weapons and maps. Play with the six races and various classes to learn which best appeals to you and your gameplay style. The character choices are interesting, and the sound draws you into the game. The booming wrestling-match commands give you that tournament feel. On the down side, there is a lot of cursing in the default taunts, so this is yet another reason the game isn't great for younger kids (apart from the obvious violence). The graphics and physics are truly amazing. They've gone an excellent job both with indoor and outdoor maps. Players who are used to the Doom-like graphics of some other games out there will really appreciate the attention to detail put into the development here.  The way in which your character moves, and the world through which you are moving, are both very realistic. The weapons represent a good mix of styles. Some might complain that some of the uber-weapons from previous releases are missing - but there's a reason for that, it's called gameplay balance. The weapon set you have available here helps ensure that you have to use some brains and strategy to win, not just raw button-mashing ability. Where the game really shines is multiplayer. This is what it was made for. Once you've spent enough time in single player to learn the controls, races and weapons, be sure to head on line! You can play classics like deathmatch, capture the flag, bombing run (like football) and domination (a control-area setup). Highly recommended for any on line fan of first person shooters!	1
I have played the original UT for over three years now, and you know what?  I still play it more than this new UT 2003.  Sure, the graphics are fabulous, it's fast, the sounds are great and the control is smooth.  What's wrong then?  Well, for starters, the weapons stink.  Gone is the sniper rifle, replaced by the unusable lightning gun, the mini-gun is all but useless, and the rocket/flak weapons are shadows of their former selves.  My biggest problem with this game are the levels...  The first UT had a great variety of immersive, moody levels, and no two felt alike.  All the levels in UT 2003 feel like the same "techno-grunge" industrial warehouse done with different textures.  Even the outdoor levels disappoint.  Moreover, the game modes stink: gone is fan favorite assault, replaced by the ridiculously stupid and frustrating bombing run.  Gone are other game modes: last man standing, etc.  As a result, the game feels like an updated version of Quake III, with its identical levels and lighting fast gameplay.	-1
This game is really good. I haven't played yet, though it looks quite GOOD! The game has the best mutiplayer service ever! If you like playing online(of course it's free), just go to the store and buy this game. You can't play multi? Then I don't recommend you to buy this game. The game is pretty much the same to the original so you can stick to the old one. Thanks.	1
I never played UT, so this is very new to me, but this game is a blast. I keep hearing how awesome the graphics were, and though they are very good, I think Wolfenstein & MOHAA are better. What seperates this game from them is the fast paced action. And I do mean fast. This may be the fastest paced game I have ever played. There are several cool maps, unique weapons, and tons of action. The single player mission isn't very hard. It seems to me that this was made just to teach how to play, but it was still very fun. The last match is incredibly tough. You also have instant action which places you on one of the maps against 4 or 5 computer players. It is fun, but not very hard. The hardest thing for me is figuring out the secret moves you can do after you have collected some adrenalin. I'm still having trouble with that. The multiplay is really good. I was surprised how little lag there has been. I have not had trouble getting into a game yet and it hasn't gotten so laggy that I had to find another game. There's alot of gore & bad language and the music and sound effects are very solid. You can play deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and bombing run (I don't understand that name since you are trying push some kind of ball through a portal of some sort. Kind of lame if you ask me) so there are plenty of playing options and there are already new maps coming out. If you want plenty of action to get your adrenalin pumping, this is your game.	1
At last, the speculation is over and Unreal Tournament 2003 (UT2003) has finally been released.  I've been playing this over the past week and resisted the impulse to criticise solely in the basis of it feeling different to UT or being unaccustomed to some of the developments.  I've given it a fair try-out in order to form a balanced view before reviewing so that my observations are as objective as possible.  Overall my impressions are that UT2003 is definitely a worthy successor (and dare I say improvement)to UT though with a few minor quibbles. Here's the good news: *  Bugs.  As in "where did they go?".  Amazingly I have had not even a suggestion of a problem with this release.  Well sorted software on the first release - it's an industry first!  Maybe the delays in releasing this game gave then a chance to clear up the bugs.  Well done. *  The graphics and gameplay are superb.  A definite improvement on UT.  The resolution is much sharper than UT especially in the scenery. *  The maps are really amazing.  Some of them are huge, far bigger than any in UT.  Lots of low gravity locations and outdoors too.  Some are bizarre and/or spooky and the vast majority are excellent. *  Weaponry is largely similar to UT with some improvements.  The Flak Cannon is far deadlier now and other interesting improvements have been made.  Also the Bio-sludge rifle is now a formidable weapon. *  The enemy roster is far larger and includes robotics and aliens as well as some very sinister gene-boosted humans.  Very spooky. *  All those reviews grumbling about the announcer? Ignore them; the sounds are very good and certainly don't detract from the excitement.  The taunts and noises from the far wider roster of enemies are very well sorted.  Check out the robotic taunts such as "Your programming is inferior" when you've been blown away by "Widowmaker" for the nth time. *  Lots of other good stuff; too numerous to mention everything. Taking the rough with the smooth, here's some stuff which I'm a bit wary about: *  Performance, while generally OK overall, takes a dive when too many bots are activated.  However, my worst fears on performance overall were unfounded. *  The single-player deathmatch part of the standard game is pretty limited.  There's a ladder for team deathmatch but the single-player is not well represented.  That's not a problem if you play on-line. *  The alternate fire for the rocket launcher (throw grenade) has been scrapped.  Great shame as this reduces the flexibility of the weapon. *  The game is set too fast.  This is partially user selectable so unless you want everything looking like a speeded-up cartoon change this setting so slow things down. Overall though let's be clear, this is a great game which moves forward from UT is a way which most players will appreciate. Essential.	1
I'm an old-fashioned casual gamer since the 80's.  I've always preferred passive, strategic games and simulators over the newest multiplayer shootemups.  But... I got irresistibly curious after all the hype and publicity surrounding this game.  So I downloaded the 97+MB free demo and I tell you right now, this game has made me radically change my mind about online gaming. "It's so kool!" The first thing that got me hooked to this game was the simplicity in getting started right away.  I loaded it and immediately was surrounded (and humiliated) by online assassins. It wasn't exactly the graphics that surprised me, but the playability.  The movements are smooth, easy to control, the environment is crisp and clear.  Be careful though, performance depends on factors such as system specs and connection speeds. The current MINIMUM requirements are Pentium III 500mhz.  I assume that you need to have a faster system a good video accelerator and probably (read again, probably) a high-speed Internet connection (cable, DSL) to take full advantage of this game. That's the good thing about the demo.  Although it's a huge download, it's free and you can determine how it works on your system. Initially the interface was a little complicated for me since I'm not  used to the newest 1st person games, but the designers really made a good effort to make the interface intuitive enough to make it simple and avoid frustrations. You can play deathmatches, team play, flag capture and other variations.  I prefer death matches, it makes a very entertaining and quick virtual gotcha;  you actually feel the adrenaline rush as you crouch, strafe, jump and shoot for your "life". The program has a customizable weapon priority feature where you can determine wether to arm any weapon you pick up during the game based on its priority.  If you are carrying a high-priority weapon, you will keep it armed if you pick a low priority one.  This is a nice strategic option that everyone should take a look to improve their survival rate.  You can also manually select your weapon, of course. What can I tell you about playing online, there are thousands of people playing around the clock, so it doesn't matter if you want to play at 12pm or 3am, there's always someone available to be challenged.  Or you can setup your own LAN at home and have a blast. I think my review hasn't even covered 10% of the game (I'm playing a demo) but if this just 10% or even 50%, it is definitely worth a future purchase. A definite winner.	1
Have to add more comments: I guess what is really disappointing here...is that I was hoping for something different--an improvement into the World of UT. The World of UT was awesome as most people who played it will agree( I spent nearly 3 years addicted to it)--all the way from the laugh of the RA announcer( when you ran into an oppenant from around a corner and blasted each other at close range) to the assault games( yes, I was in love with Assault, hammer jump, rocket launch, razor shots, etc.) UT was better than Quake because of it 3D environment was better...of course, they are all just a games, but there was something special about the old UT maps and the game play, that MADE you want to play it for hours...UT2k3 lost this IMHO. L8r, M...Tx  aka  WiReD ================================= Sorry, all you UT2k3 lovers, but I played UT for 2 1/2 years, and really had a lot of fun. Went on to play some MOH:AA, GR, AA:O, BF1942 so I guess I'm getting used to realer environments. Even though it's all just for fun, some of the Big Pills( adrenaline) and other powerups along with the player skins seem more like quake. I know, then don't play this game if I don't like it. Yep, I'll still play it, but I had hoped that they would've taken what they started and developed it into something unlike any other game and kept the futuristic world with the little details that take away from the realism...ditch the pills, and make the powerups like the way the powerups look in tribes...like where you connect to a power station instead of running up to some huge "Plus" symbol. UT2k3 is far advanced in graphics and game play, and I can't wait for more FPS games like BF1942 so that it's gets more realistic each year.	1
Simply put, THIS GAME IS AMAZING.  Let's face it, anything from here on out in the Unreal legacy is going to make Game of the Year.  I played this game on a 1.7ghz system, with a 64bit  Geforce card, and guess what... IT LOOKED AMAZING.  Then I played the game on my older system... Only 500mz and an old 32 bit ATI card, and guess what... IT LOOKED AMAZING!  Even still, i played it on my buddie's pentium 2. NO VIDEO CARD, and only 64 megs of ram. Guess what... LOOKED AMAZING!!   There are too many reviewers/doom-sayers out on the net, dampering the hopes of gamers by proclaiming that you'll need a super-rig and one hell of a graphics card to enjoy this game.  I am here to tell you THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL.  This game boasts the extremely low requirements of 32 megs of ram, and a 450mhz system.  Now I'll admit, with a better system, you would be able to crank the resolution and frame rate, etc... more little details.  But i'm telling you, even with a low-end system this game looks great, and is ... addictive as hell.  Get's the adrenaline and blood-lust pumping even more than its predecessor.	1
First off let me say that the first UT did not meet my expectations when compared to Quake3. The movement, even when the mouse sensitivity was maxed, was sluggish. So, I didn't get my hopes up about 2K3. Then I downloaded the demo. OMFG! This game is a blast. It actually reminds me of a suped up Quake3. The demo runs great. I've only been playing multi-player games and it's real fluid. In fact I've been neglecting Wolfenstien for the last few days playing a new multi-player mode in UT2K3 where the 2 teams need to get possession of a gold ball and score in the opposing teams goal. You can pass the ball to your team-mates and defend or take it all the way for the score. Very addictive, especially the InstaGib with low gravity. I can't wait to see what other new modes were added. Of course there's still the game show announcer voice shouting DOUBLE KILL!, MULTI-KILL! and RAMPAGE! etc. when you're in the zone. This game represents the next ring on the ladder of arcade style combat. And if this game looks and plays this great, I can't wait to see what ID has in store for us in Quake4 or Doom. Man, just when the PS2 modem comes out and I get a little more excited about the future of online console gaming, a PC game like this comes out and pulls me right back in. Pick this up. It'll be money well spent.	1
Can it really be that the replacement for the singular Unreal Tournament is about to be released?  This is great news and I am personally looking forward to locking myself away for days on end to indulge! From the sources I have seen there are valid improvements to UT but keeping the basic idea the same - so the developers have concentrated on moving the graphics forward and keeping the logic of the game the same.  This is right on the money as games need to make the most of the forward march of PC technology.  For myself I have been busily upgrading my PC in preparation with more processor, more memory and a new graphics card.  I mention this because it seems to me that the enhanced graphics are going to require a pretty much top-level PC to drive decent performance out of this game. My experience with UT shows that we should take the developers guide-lines on Hardware requirements with a big pinch of salt.  The box of my copy of UT said that it would run on a PC without a graphics card - sure, try that if you want one frame every five seconds!!  Let's get real - the higher the PC spec the better this game is going to run and I wouldn't be thinking to try this game without a fairly serious graphics card. I hope that Amazon.com will publish this review this time around (I think they censored the last one as I mentioned the PC requirement issue); even though I am urging caution on the PC requirements side I have actually rated it as a 5* release.

I love Game Boy Advance. The graphics and sound are so much better than Game Boy Color. However, I don't see much point of the Platinum edition. My brother bought this version, since it came out right around his birthday. Pros: 1) Great sound and graphics 2) Plays most Game Boy Color, Game Boy, and all Game Boy Advance games. (I tested the Game Boy and Game Boy Color) 3) If you buy the right game link cable you can connect a GBA to a GBC. 4) Small and portable; great for trips Cons: 1) Burns batteries quick 2) Not much point in getting a different color, unless you like silver. Plain looking. 3) Lack of other colors Game Boy Advances are great, I highely reccomend one. Make your decision for this color based on if it appeals to you. Unless you are a collector, I don't see much point in getting such a plain color if secretly in your mind you want another color. I honestly don't like the color of the Platinum version, however right now for a limited time it is available with a free light, which is a great deal. But, you need to make sure you copy the code for the light and put it in your cart. So, if I like it so much, why only 4 stars? Well, Nintendo doesn't make any decent rechareable battery packs for GBA, so I'm mad at them.	1
Love it	1
This game console was definitely a step up for Nintendo. The backwards compatibility allows you to play all of your older Gameboy games on an updated console. And the platinum color gives it an almost futuristic look.	1
Before I sold it for a DS.  However, I am now a game collector and I specifically asked for this color for its rarity.  I love playing this system and my favorite games are Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap and Golden Sun.	1
Cause I was lied too you can't see anything on the screen it's useless if you can't play gm's t	-1
The product was in excellent conditions. Thank you very much. Better than described. My nephew is going to play with it a  lot	1
What is the best selling and fastest selling video game machine ever?  PS2?...nope,  Xbox?...hardly, that's right it is the GAME BOY! It is so popular in fact, the Game Boy Advance has sold over 1 million units in 10 days so far during this holiday season.  All Nintendo-made products have been of high-quality and well designed. This is especially true for the GBA. The GBA has a 32-bit processor, just like the Playstation (the Game Boy Color had only an 8-bit processor). It has very good screen quality. In fact, the image resolution on the Game Boy Advance's screen is greater than that of some HDTV's. The Game Boy Advance has incredible sound and the speakers can play louder. The sound is even better with headphones. A nice added touch is the power light--It is green with new batteries, but turns red when there is 20-30% battery left and the light slowly fades out. The GBA is able to connect to the Nintendo Gamecube through a special link cable available separately.  You can also purchase an e-reader for Game Boy Advance that allows you to scan in paper cards that let you play classic NES games.  Another exciting recent development is the annoucement of an accessory that plugs into the expansion port of your Gamecube and allows you to play GBA games on your TV.  However, this product I believe won't be available until around March or so of next year. All these improvements are very helpful and amazingly have virtually no effect on the size. The GBA still fits easily in your pocket and is only about a centimeter or longer and wider than the game boy color. In addition, the GBA has two shoulder buttons on top that aid in game-play. The game paks are half the size of old game boy games but the GBA still plays all 1000+ Game Boy games already released. Due to the smaller size of the new games, the old Game Boy games stick out the top half-way, which is disappointing. It comes in the standard colors of glacier (clear purple), indigo (purple), fuschia (pink-ish red), white, and special edition platinum.  You can also buy a black verison with Super Mario Advance free here at Amazon.com (through Toys "R" Us) and I have seen a red version available at Target. I would say that the Game Boy Advance is a very well designed portable gaming system and definately well worth its newly-lowered price.	1
Fancy platinum color aside, the GBA is great diversion to kill time with, even if you are a 30-something with kids (like me). I frequently end up with 20 - 30 minutes to kill while waiting around for something or another and having this GBA around has totally taken the drag our of waiting. If you plan to use your GBA in this manner you'll want to make sure that you buy games that are good in 20 minute increments and have a way to save completed levels. You'll also want a carrying case and a light since the GBA is not back lit and lighting conditions vary so much from place to place. Buy a nintendo title as your first game like Super Mario Advance or Super Mario World.  Nintendo has defined this space and they definitely make good games to really get you hooked.	1
Yeah, I like the Platinum color best, too. But, that was the last consideration in getting Game Boy Advance. Other benefits are better battery life, wider screen, better color, better handling, etc. Not to mention that it plays all the Game Boy Color games as well. There are a lot of the Super Nintendo games coming into GBA because it basically is a simple port for the software companies. Our first GBA game was Mario Super Circuit (ala Mario Kart on Nintendo 64). I was pleasantly surprised to get all these improvements and pay less than we did for GBC.	1
At first I thought the system was horrible because the screen was too dark but when I found a good lighting device for it called Mad Catz I discovered it looks a lot better. The way you have to use the Mad Catz light is have the power off until you got the batteries in and the bottom put back if you want the brightest light. Im not as good at portable games as I am with regular systems like Game Cube but having Sonic Advance,Super Mario Deluxe and Pac Man Collection by my side a lot is very satisfying. So I recommend you get a light and learn how to use it if you really want to enjoy the GBA.	1
wonderful, artistic movements of hundreds if not thousands of battle action warriors! realistic strategy, planning in diplomacy, supply, planning ahead in combat!  the only deficiency was the user manual. too brief in detail. it takes more losing games to get to understand how to win which may have been designed that way? i sat in front of my computer for several days playing untikl i became proficient and then i started watching the fighting scenes closer! amazingly artistic and bloody, too!	1
One of my sentimental favorite strategy games is Lords of the Realm 2. Raise crops, build castles and armories, requistion armies, pay taxes, and annihilate the the baron in the next county. Like LOTR2, Legion is uncomplicated--and fun. UNLIKE Civ3, which is just way too much work and hassle (and too comlicated and time-consuming, but that's a different review), I have yet to tire of Legion. I enjoy Roman civilization, and have found Legion to be an accurate, interesting turn-based strategy game. You build armies, fight other tribes and nations and balance your economy. The troop types are very accurate (archers, Velite javelinmen, Celtic warhosts, German mercenaries, legions, praetorians, gladiators, etc.) and the opponents historically realistic. Legion doesn't have lots of layers (like Civ3 or AOK), but the layers it does have are a lot of fun. (Reading recommendation: check out Colleen McCullough's fiction series called "Masters of Rome." The first book is called 'The First Man in Rome.')	1
Legion is just another good game of strategy. Your goal is to expand your empire (whether you play with the Romans or not) at the expense of your neighbors. The game is really easy to play if you're acquainted to strategy games (such as Civilization) and not that hard if you're not. Like all strategy games you have to manage your resources wisely (wheat, iron, lumber) and deal carefully with the other tribes. The biggest con I've found so far is the impossibility of selecting difficulty levels (this has been solved in the 1.06 patch). There are other minor flaws as well, such as management of cities only (no province management?!? what about all those roads that lead to Rome? who's gonna build and look after them?).  In few words the strategy looks like: "build a powerful army and garrison it inside a city with a medium/large fort and a quartermaster built in it and nobody's gonna take it away from you (unless the AI arrives with 4 huge armies)" The overall is a fun addictive game who could get you stuck to the PC for hours...	1
Dinosaur Digs is a fine addition to this already exciting game. If you already own Zoo Tycoon then you already know how exciting the can be if you really get creative. Dinosaur Digs allows you to be more creative than ever with many new dinosaur additions including the ferocious T-Rex! I will keep this short and sweet. If you are interested in my review, I suggest you check out my review on the original Zoo Tycoon. I recommend this expansion pack to anyone who enjoys Zoo Tycoo as much as I do. Give it a shot I guarantee that it will not disappoint.	1
I just have to say that this is the best racing/jet ski game EVER. It has GREAT graphics and so many things you can choose from. You can unlock different races, wetsuits, jet-skis, and teammates. You can customize your music to suit YOUR mood. The water is realistic and the races are fun in any mode! This is a must have for ALL X-Box Owners!	1
I bought this game, thinking it would be pretty fun, good for parties.  I love water, and water parks, and hot showers, and jacoozies, and lakes, and oceans, and pools, etc...  Basicly, I love water, and I picked this game up becuase of that. I thought this would probably be a decent game...kinda fun.  I never expected it to be, tho, what it was. One of the best games I have ever played...just because of how awsome everything is.  Here's what I thought of Splashdown for the Microsoft XBOX: 1) Gameplay: It's so AWSOME!  Ok, heres what u do.  You start out with (in multiplayer), 4 characters to race as and 3 courses to race in.  THATS NO GOOD!  So you have to go through the single player campaign and unlock dozens of courses, several new characters, and well, have a blast!  In races, you do a time trial.  You try to get the best time with 3 laps around the new course your going to race in.  Whoever of the 4 racers who has the highest time goes first.  Then on down...  This is (in my opinion), a lot more fair than starting out 4th every race like most racing games.  Now you have the chance to earn a spot.  Ok, so after this, you race.  The locations you race in are BEAUTIFUL!  Fun, wavy, exciting water, blazing sunset, crowds, trees, etc...  There are jumps to go off (tons), where you try to get a ton of air.  Why?  So you can do some of the COOLEST tricks around! You can do flips, handstands, supermans (grab on to the back of your waveracer and HANG ON!!!), and dozens of other awsome tricks!  You can also, if you want, flip your waveracer.  There are over a dozen tricks to do for each character.  Cool, eh?  The more tricks you do, the faster your waveracer goes, and the bigger air you get on your jumps.  As you advance, you unlock dozens of new courses and a few new characters and colorful cotumes for them.  One course has you jumping higher and higher on man made platforms, leading to a *HUGE* jump at the top.  Anyone who can land the jump (which is probably 50-60 feet at least), most likely wins the race.  SUPER COOL!  Once you unlock everything, the multiplayer is endless.  I'll go into that later... 2) Graphics: The best part of the game!  Lucious, blue, wavy, *WILD* water that is just waiting to be blazed through!  The envirements are beautiful as well!  Trees, mountains, several paths to take leading up to EVERY jump (almost).  HUGE jumps, splashing water...it's incredible!  The water is wild, uncontrollable!  Go off a bad wave, it could flip you over.  Watch as your waveracer sinks to the water on a crash, sending the rider dozens of feet into the air...OUCH!  The splashing, the flips, the jumps, etc...  It's just so awsome!  I love playing this!  The characters look cool, the specatators look awsome.  It's all just so well done!  Graphics here...4 stars (crowds could use some work tho!) 3) Controls: AWSOME!  Pushing A lightly will glide you through turns with ease.  Pushing down ALL THE WAY will send you flying through the water...and into tons of crashes off turns if your not careful.  Steering is awsome, the tricks can be learned in minutes.  Yet the real art of racing here takes awhile to learn.  It's really quite fun, and one of the best controlling racing games I've played in a long time! *Unlockables*: There are some areas that you can go that send you FLYING through the air at hundreds of feet.  How?  If you go deep into the water in some areas, a giant squid hand will come up and grab you (thats right, a GIANT squid hand will grab you).  It will then fling you all the way across the course, depending on where your grabbed.  Sometimes your character will hit a bridge, a boat, etc...  I've even hit some of the other racers on the other end of the course.  SWEET!  Just more depth to a great game! 4) Multiplayer: Once unlocking everything, this is endless.  You can race with all the characters, in all the locations (there are 14-15 ranging from Florida, Japan, to even Australia!).  You can use different colored uniforms, and well, have a blast competing with your friend!  The graphics, characters, controls, and AWSOME crashes, this game is so much fun in every way, its a MUST BUY! Basicly, this is one of the few good water racing games you'll find on the XBOX.  The graphics are awsome, the controls are great, and the multiplayer (only 1-2 players sadly) rocks!  This is a game that is fun, graphicly and in controls, and has dozens of things to try.  When you finally get bored (if ever), there are some cheats you can look up that let you race against Army Planes, UFO's, etc...  Really cool! This is a game that is just fun!  It has great graphics, the variety of courses are so different that you'll have to learn each all over again.  So many courses, characters, game types, etc...  This game will keep you having fun (especially water fans) for many hours of gameplay to come! Thx!	1
Okay, there are plenty of games that are more exciting out there, but this is a really nice family game to have. It is good, clean, and fun. The graphics are good (but not great) and the physics are for the most part realistic and believable. The controls are easy to pick up and the tricks are fairly easy to complete. Splashdown contains a good mix of upbeat music and the gameplay should keep you occupied for a decent amount of time. Just remember, although the game is fun, don't expect a heart-pounding, adrenaline-producing experience.	1
This one was a sleeper - hadn't heard anything about it, but rented it one day. After playing it with my daughters (ages 9 and 7) for a few hours, we were all laughing together.  Even my wife (a non-gamer) got into it.  We bought it the next week. It's lots of fun to race each other or the computer.  But you can also go into "free ride" mode and just explore the different tracks.  I found it to be much more fun than other extreme sports games (like Tony Hawks 3 or 4).  It's easy to start playing it right away, has a nice training mode, fun multi-player races and a career mode that allows you to unlock more tracks and racers. The only drawback is Atari's game saving.  Everytime I put the disk in it asks me if I want to load the existing game again (and threatens to delete it if I don't allow it to load it).	1
Strangely enough, but this is actually one of if not my BEST XBOX game. This is the first sport, race game I've seen to totally fulfill the game racers dream. The engineers have somehow combined difficulty of figuring out how to race WITHOUT sacraficing top speed and awesome gameplay. Totally totally awesome. I don't know hwo they did it. To top it all off the graphics are just brilliant! I love this game so much because I truly feel like I'm in the water while racing. You can't beat awesome graphics with awesome gameplay. How can I give it anything but a 5. I would give it a 10 in a heartbeat if it were available. I rented this game and even though I've completed the career I will still purchase it because I love playing it.	1
This game is the only Jet-Ski game available for the X-Box, but there are immediate similarities drawn between this game, and the Nintendo 64 classic WaveRace. The levels are creative and fun, but it's the water graphics that really make the game shine.  Never before has a game captured water effects so flawlessly as Splashdown. The controls are at first a little odd, but after a few tuturial lessons they become easier.  After an hour of playing you'll be a master at carving a wake through the water. The gameplay is fun, but some levels can get a little frustrating.  It's a definite rental, but if you're a fan of water sports than you won't be dissapointed.  This is by far the best Jet-ski racing game available.	1
This exclusive GameCube game is the brand-new third installment in the Smugglers Run franchise. It offers the best multiplayer, featuring 4-player action, brand-new modes, new countermeasures, areas, and vehicles. The all-new area is Eastern Europe, which was designed with multiplayer in mind. It features castles, inns, farms, an abandoned industrial complex, and lush vegetation, set during the fall season. There's a new vehicle, the hoversled, which is the fastest but also weakest of the bunch. The brand-new countermeasures are the Cloaking Device, Vertical Boost, Acid Drop, and Repel Sphere in addition to the already existing Speed Boost, Smoke Screen, Oil Slick and Bomb. The extensive multiplayer modes include Loot Grab, Crooks and Smugglers, Domination, Fox and Hounds, and team Bomb Tag. The graphics are also nicely polished over the previous PS2 Smugglers Run games. Better specular lighting and reflections, higher-polygon models, smoother frame rates, better draw-distances, etc. This brand-new Smugglers Run game is certainly the best and most refined version yet!	1
You all know the story of this game. If anyone hasn't noticed with that new piece of crap "juggling" system is the cheapest piece of garbage added to the series, or love the idea of cheapsies, then BOO to you. This is the most EQUALLY BALANCED game in the series, hands down.	1
I love playing Tekken of course! The graphics on this one are amazing. I remember my brother had this game a few years back and I couldn't stop playing! Fell in love. Tekken 5 will be my next purchase, since I have Tekken Tag Tournament and this already. This is a BAADD game!	1
Loved this game it brought back memories of my childhood.	1
grand kids love tekken...	1
I bought this game yesterday and I thought it was alot of fun.  I played it all night.  What u do is u have to pick up all these different things and take them to a certain base.  But police are after u and there r other players trying to get your loot sometimes.  U just ram right into them and u get ur loot back.  And there is also a joyriding thing on it where u can just drive around all u want and explore the territory, similar to Midnight club except ur not in a city.  bottom line, A.	1
Not much more to say except that this game wasn't worth the ten dollars I spent on it when I purchased it used.  Though there is somewhat of a story line, the game is boring.  It's one of those that you wished you had borrowed first before you purchased it. I think the only thing that this game would be useful for is to use the disc as a coaster on an end table. Bottom line:  F	-1
Out of all the smuggler's run games, this one is the best.  I just picked it up and am very satisfied with it.	1
I considered ordering this game because of some of the initial "fun" reviews that came out.  I'm glad I rented it first!  Although the concept of the game is good, the actual gameplay isn't all that great.  It gets boring pretty quickly.  I found myself really desiring some "real" weapons during multi-player mode.  I then started to think that maybe I should start employing strategy... only to find out there isn't much to employ. Summary: Graphics are OK, gameplay is OK, Fun level is short-lived. Rent it once or twice for a change of pace, but spend your real money on something else.	-1
Smuggler's Run is a fun game forpeople who love the thrill of off-road chases. But after a while,it get's tedious. All in all, it'sstill a fun game.	1
This game is great, and it has been a while since I have played this game so I am not sure if the load time for the character selection screen is supposed to be as long as it is. This is really the only concern with this game other than that I have no complaints, it plays just like new.	1
It seems to me like this game was half done and I don't see it as that bad. Its too dark as to gloom on a cloudy day,if that makes sense. I do like Violet!! He's so hip and cool lol. He needs to make a return.	1
Awesome love it Very good service! THANK YOU	1
Good, but Tekken 5 and 6 are better. Enviromental fights are unecessary, and clunky. Otherwise, this game is good.	1
Excellent	1
Great game	1
Good soundtrack, had variety, one of the tekkens with an actual plot(3 4 and 5 were slightly plot heavy) this period in time tekken was great, had that underground dark atmosphere than when 6 came(best combat)but 6 was brighter in comparison regarding tone and storytelling, which in 6 was ridiculous.	1
If you like street fighter and virtua fighter, this game is perfect. Also good for 2 players. Pretty good graphics.	1
Plan to be ordering again as soon as I can.  Thank you for the solid case.  Couldn't ask for more.	1
This is a game that all of the people in my family, who like karate, play. There are a lot of characters and different things from the other games. My family is a fan of the Tekken series and have several of the other games. We enjoy them all and are really happy with this version!	1
all video games purchased at this time have been great.  The are in good condition and all have been playable.  The grand children have been able to play them and enjoy them.  There is nothing more that I can say about this video game as I personally do not play games.	1
TEKKEN LIVES Play through a great story mode as the story continues with Jin Kazama in his quest to get rid of the Devil Gene in his blood as well as his family the Mishama's	1
I've been a fan of Tekken, and I've played from tekken 1 - tekken 5. I'm omre of a calssic gamer, so don't judge me. Here I am, in 2011 righting a post on 2001 games. But whatever, here's the review.  SO, this game has amazing graphics. Compared to other tekkens, due to this is made in 01, this game's graphic rocks. Controls respond pretty well, and Jin's new fighting style.... is still pretty good... There is 20 characters to choose from, and there's 10 default characters.  ~Game Modes~ Tekken Force (Beat up robot-looking dudes) Practice (Practice your moves) Time Attack Arcade (arcade version) Story Mode (Unlocks other characters and  tells you one's story) Survival (Fight as many people as you can til' you get KOed.)  ~*Characters*~ Jin Kazama-Epic karate dude Kazuya Mishima-Demonic Karate dude, Jin's dad Heihachi Mishima-Other karate dude, kazuya's dad, jin's grandfather  Hwoarang-Korean Tai-Kwon-Doe dude Christine Monterio-Female version of Eddy Nina Williams-Assassin, Bone techniques Steve Fox-British Boxer Julia-MMA lady Yoshimitsu-Robot Samurai Violet-Random person Paul Phoenix-Powerful dude, pro hair Marshall Law-Bruce Lee wanna-be, epic Kuma-BEAR >:D Xiaoyu-junior high, chinese girl Lei-Chinese dude, jackie chan? Bryan- creepy dude, but good.. i guess King-Leopard/masked pro wrestler Craig Marduk-Big dude, (no-one-uses-him) character  Combat-Robot dude Miharu-Xiaoyu's fighting style, but different person  - a noob	1
This game has gotten mixed reviews due to a lack of an interesting story-line. I couldn't disagree more. Ever since I was young, I have been in love with the Tekken series. Brings back a lot of good memories. I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun. Though the graphics aren't as top notch at games these days are, but it's still an entertaining game to play. If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games, this is a must own. This game was a big improvement from the blocky charachters and the story-line is great. Get this before it's too late. It will be gone before you know it.	1
I only bought this because my previous Tekken 4 game was stolen :( . But for a good price of $4.00 and $3.99 s&h, i could not turn this item down	1
The fourth installment of the Tekken series is finally here! This game continues the Tekken series in perfection! This game has amazing three-demensional graphics, fast and very good game-play, and overall, can keep you amused for months!  This game is the best fighting game I have ever played in my life (yes, I think it even surpasses it's sequel, Tekken 5 in gameplay)! The game has amazing techniques for each character, making it a real challange to successfully master one character's set of moves! The game also has cooperative button combinations, meaning that the attacks and/or series of attacks actually work when you press the buttons (unlike some games I have played)! Another good thing about this game is that you cannot beat it with the old "button-mashing", but to beat it, you will need true skills and potential.  The game also has very good stories! Every single character's story is very fun, and also is very detailed, showing every small thing in their story! The character's stories are long, fun, and amusing! When you beat the story, it shows an epilogue in high-quality three demensional graphics, and also, when you beat a character's story, you unlock some of the hidden characters!  Apart from having good game-play and good story mode, the game has awesome tracks played while you are fighting! All the tracks are very good, but my personal favorite is the one in the Mishima Dojo (which is in the Final Stage)! Not only will you be amused while playing this game, but your ears will also be having the time of their lives!  This game has so many good features, graphics, and music, but the only problem in the game in my opinion is the lack of characters.  There are only about twenty characters in this game if not less.  If it wasn't for this little problem, the game would be the perfect Tekken game, easily surpassing Tekken 5, and many other fighting games I have played.  This "lack of characters" problem is fulfilled in the sequel to this game, Tekken 5, but Tekken 5 isn't as "original" and "Tekkenish" as this game is.  But don't let this little problem stop you from buying this game, for it is still an amazing game despite this problem.  Well recommended!  Rating? 9.7/10  A last word: Buy this game instead of Tekken 5.  Tekken 5 is currently $50.00, while this one is only $20.00, and apart from it being less money, it is a much better game in my opinion. Enjoy!	1
This game is one I played twice in the arcade, as the title might give you a hint about. And both times, after a lot of effort and never giving up, I won the game. And I was champion. This game is both fun and cool, the graphics, sound effects, music, and impacts of hits couldn't get a whole lot better, and many of the very best characters are starring in this game. Here is how I rank them----!!  1. King-My # 1 favorite Tekken fighter. He is part jaguar, part man  and all big strong wrestler. He can do all sorts of damaging moves, and both the times I won this game, it was playing as him.  2. Yoshimitsu-A real cool ninja robot. The shine of his glowing sword is outmatched only by the coolness of his getup and the way he can give new meaning to the word "ninja." He rocks like drums.  3. Nina Williams-She, as in all other Tekken games, is a ruthless and sneaky villain of a woman who is both beautiful and skilled. She also knows how to be dastardly. She is one cool little b!#ch!  4. Jin Kazama-I can barely describe how intense and awesome this guy is. He is just about the best karate fighter even created, and he can kick nearly every butt he faces. He's really cool looking, too!  5. Paul Phoenix-Well, he's a judo fighter! I love his hairstyle, and there are very few Tekken fighters who are as good as him!  6. Bryan Fury-One of my favorite villains of all time. He is a well trained kickboxer, and nothing says dark and mean like his look. Gold-green skin, grey hair, and lots of silver scars.  7. Heihachi Mishima-The final boss in this game. He is a terrfic and challenging opponent and is also one of the top bad guys!  8. Hwoarang-Where to start? He's skilled in nearly every form of combat, he has some cool orange hair, and his getup is slick as can be. Also he seems to create explosions.  9. Craig Marduk-He is cool, don't get me wrong. He is big, strong and powerful, and can really give you a big struggle. That is, unless you play as King. Then you can kick the s--t out of him.  10. Marshall Law-The Bruce Lee of Tekken. He is not only a great fighter, he is also one of my favorites and I love him! He is an expert at martial arts, and his shirtless body shows huge muscle.  11. Kazuya Mishima-A minion of Heihachi. He is both nasty and vicious. In other words, he is a very well done evil villain.  12. Lei Wulong-He wears a neat outfit, and he has more skills than you can shake a fist at! Also has very dark black hair.  13. Julia Chang-She is both attractive and a butt kicker. She is a Native American naturalist who is a challenge to the majority of her opponents.  14. Steve Fox-This guy is a fabulous boxer. He is very powerful and fast, and his boxing moves were so sharp that he'd provide a challenge to someone as skilled as Muhammad Ali.  15. Christie Monterio-God, I love this woman. She is the last one in the "one of my favorites" category. She is beautiful and se*y, she has moves which make her a real butt kicker, and she has a very touching storyline in Tekken 5, the game right after this.  16. Lee Chaolan-Hey, this guy is pretty good! He has his way of fighting well, and he has a pretty snazzy look! He not so bad!  17. Panda-Well, she is cute. And plump. And funny. And she is a pretty damn good fighter, especially for the animal that she is and has the name of. In other words, she's pretty good, like Lee.  18. Kuma-He, too, is pretty good. He's VERY strong, and can give even King a run for his money. He is a grizzly bear, but is the best fighter of all grizzly bears, just like Panda is of pandas.  19. Ling Xiaoyu-I will say this much-she is sorta cute. And she's got her moves. Like the 3 above, she is, as I say, pretty good.  20. Violet-He's the last of the "pretty good" fighters. His big purple outfit is distracting, and he can fight good. Not as good as the fighters above, though. But he is still a decent warrior.  21. Combot-I HATE COMBOT! HE ABSOLUTELY SUCKS! Of all fighters I faced in Tekken 4 or any Tekken game for that matter, he was the easiest to defeat. He looks stupid, he acts dumb, and if you put all the Tekken games together, there are very few fighters more pathetic than this loser. Whatever, at least he's this game's only loser.  All in all, this is an A+++++ game. I love it to pieces, and if you have a Playstation 2, then I highly suggest and recommend you get this game. Oh, and Tekken is my second favorite beat-em up game of all time topped only by Mortal Kombat. And Street Fighter is in definite third place next to these two. Anyway, you have seen my review. Buy this well worth your money video game now.	1
Despite what people say about ths video game, Tekken IV is probably one of the better fighting games out there. It sticks realism and actual fighting technquies without falling into the all out and full-blown fantasy like other fighters such as Soul Calibur(?) and Mortal Kombat do (Which isn't a bad thing but sometimes its best just to stick to reality). Since I've never played the previous three Tekken Games and I have only read backgrounds and summaries for them I can only give you a review on what I know so far.  The Graphics in this game is some of the best I've seen, I was blown away the first couple of times when playing this game. The CGI-3D graphics had a glossy look to them and I was almost convinced that it looked totally life-like, but flaws in the graphics kept me from that edge. Its a lot better than what Namco usually has in this particular department. The body models for the characters range from different sizes (naturally), and the faical features for each is mind-boggling. The stages in this video game aren't specatular, far from it, but they have a realistic feel to it, espically the enviroments with water.  My favorite Stage is the Arena; the roar of the crowd and the rock music playing the background really gets me going. There are several fighting modes: Practice, Arcade, Survival, Vs and Time attack, Story-mode, Training and as you know and two unlockable ones in which you unlock by playing the Steve-Fox story-mode and the all-new Tekken Force mode.  The story modes for most of the characters are full of details and are intruiging with their own CGI cut scenes. However, by the worst story-mode (SPOILER) has to be Lei Wulong's; the plot wasn't bad but afterwards you get nothing but Lei saying "Freeze!" or grunting when he's chasing after Nina Williams: Stupido. But all in all this game is pretty solid the fighting is smooth and never feels clunky and the animations for the characters are great as well. One last note, the voice acting for the characters is Okay at best. A majorty of the voice telents (mainly for, Xiao, Jin,  Kazuya, his father, Julia, Nina Williams, and Yoshimitsu) do a great job for their characters, but then there are some voice talents that really don't fit the character and really have no talent when it comes to this profession. The voice actors for Marshal Law and Howrang(?) are laugable and not believable. The music has been said to be horrible, I think it goes quite will with the game and its stages, although it does have its annoying points but its far from horrible. Lastly, Tekken IV is a solid game worth buying and worth adding to your Tekken or fighting collection. --- [a 5 out of 5]	1
This is my first Tekken game. I think that this part 4 has fantastic graphics, but I am unable to truly enjoy the game because the power-bars are so weak.  I am able to kill an opponent with about 9 solid kicks. This makes each round seem waaaaaay too short. There is no way to increase the power-bar in the options menu, so that your opponent can take more damage.  I also have Virtual Fighter Evolution. In VFE, you are able to increase the power-bars from 100% to 400%. This allows each round to be longer, and more importantly = more challenging !!  The second fault is that not everything in the environment is breakable. There are a lot of glass windows in the environment, but they are NOT designed to be breakable. Only about 30% of the environmental objects are breakable. I wished that everything was breakable.	-1
A game that wait long in Playstation 2 2 years ago since PS2 release at the end of October 2000.  I played it and it was great all the way.  Kazuya and Jin are hot.  I like it.  This game is absoultely recommended.	1
Paul, Law, Bryon, Panda, King, Lee, they're back in the classic fighter that's as easy to play as it is hard to completely master. Not the difficulty and memerization of MK, but more solid punch/kick combos that are fun to utilize. Fairly good graphics. Fast, satisfying action that brings back the arcade memories in a good way.  Plus, it's got new characters that I don't remember from the older Tekkens, like Christie (nice outfit, by the way) and Steve (he's unstoppable if you know what you're doing  - ultra hard AI doesn't stand a chance when I got Steve). The big flaw is that Heichie or whatever that older guy's name is wears what is essentially a diaper at the final stage. For God's sakes, I don't want to see some forty-something fool jumping around when only a thin band of cloth clothes him. Give that outfit to one of the female fighters, instead. Wouldn't that make for an interesting final stage?  Classic arcade fun. You can't go wrong here. I have merely tapped into the "next gen" console game library, so my only recommendations would be MK Deception if you like this. (Anyone out there reading this with a more extensive recommendation opinion, please write a review for shoppers like me and offer some other similar titles).  Note: Rated Teen for violence, and, in my opinion, also for those sensitive to gay costume designs (look at Violet and Marduk or whatever his name is - green tights?) No blood really, just energy flashes when struck.  Peace out.	1
This is a solid fighting game. It has the classic Tekken fighting engine which is what sets it apart from many other fighters. It has a great soundtrack as all of the other Tekken games do. Very nice fighting arenas, though I wish there was more. Plenty of game modes to keep one busy for awhile. Nice unlockables. Great game. But not a total gem, which would be a 5.	1
This is an excellent addition to tekken series !!  It is a "new" tekken ( unlike tekken tag, which is just all the characters from 1,2 and 3 with a tag option and no story.)  Tekken 4 has awesome new characters along with all the best of the classic characters.  The graphics rule and the moves are so awesome.  You will love this game.  It is way ABOVE average ( like other reviews may say.)  I think it is the best in the series.  Tekken is the one fighting series that does not dissapoint their fans.	1
I know where mine is.  Here. I got this game for Christmas, and I couldn't have been more impressed.  There are a few more new characters, including a Vale Tudo fighter and another Capoeira artists.  Some moves have been changed, many for the better.  There is a new Training mode that is available.  One is timed as he or she completes a series of 20 attacks against a still opponent;  AND TEKKEN FORCE IS BACK!!!  The control setup for tekken force is a little confusing at times when the camera begins to change angles, but once Tekken Force is played for a while, this isn't much of an issue.  Thumbs up!!  Namco has done us well.	1
Compared to both Virtua Fighter 4s, you would definitely want this fighting game. Here are the reasons why. ~ Graphics- Pushes FAR past all other fighting games except for the Soul Caliburs!  -10/10 ~Fast gameplay; if you hit the ground, you can instantly get back up, without having to wait on the ground.  -10/10 ~It has many many MANY battle fields.  -10/10 ~The storyline is excellent; feauturing one main character returning from Tekken 2.  -10/10 ~Some of the musics are pretty good, others okay, but overall, they aren't that good.  -03/10 ~You start out with 10 characters, and about ten more to unlock. That is about average.  -08/10 ~Only 6 new characters! 4 of them are just new characters with the same moves as old characters!  -02/10 ~There's a new version of the mode not featured in any other fighting game series; the Tekken Force.  -10/10 ~Doesn't take too much up on your memory card; only about 70 Kilobytes.  -09/10 Overall, I'd say, if you want a fighting game better than Virtua Fighter 4 and Evolution, Bloody Roar 3, all Mortal Combats and all Dead or Alives, you should definitely get this fighting game. Right now, it is rated the second best fighting game for Playstation 2; Soul Calibur II is obviously in first place. But trust me, if you are a VF fan, but you didn't like VFE, get your hands on this game.	1
I give this three stars because it is a good game, but just a little better then Tekken Tag.  The characters' polygons is almost the same as it predecessor only the environment has a considerable upgrade.  It feels a lot smoother then T3 and TTT.  TTT gave us all the characters and now we have to go back down to 19 or 20?  There is no Tekken Bowl or Volleyball, which girls would actually like to play.  Good thing I only pay $20 for this.  Hopeful, Namco does something more excitement in the next one or this franchise may become a Street Fighter.	-1
I've been following Tekken since the first, so for all you new Tekken gamers out there, I'll give you some history.  In Tekken 1, Kazuya throws his father, Heihachi off a cliff in the aftermath of the tournament.  In Tekken 2, Heihachi reappears and throws Kazuya, who sold his soul to the devil, into a volcano.  Tekken 3 and Tag aren't really important to the story so I'll skip them.  In Tekken 4, Heihachi finds out that a cryogenics corperation has brought Kazuya back to life.  He launches a raid on the company's headquarters and one of his soldiers finds Kazuya there.  Heihachi then launches the King of Iron Fist 4 to lure Kazuya into his grasp. Tekken 4, without a doubt, is the most detailed Tekken yet.  At the beginning of story mode, the character's story is told along with stunning character art.  It even tells the side characters' stories(a first for the series).  Tekken force mode has been majorly upgraded since Tekken 3 and makes an excellent addition to the game.  (I wish it had ball mode though.  That was fun as hell.) Anyway, the endings are much more intricate as well.  They usually consist of more story and character art, then a cut scene.  The only exception is Christie, who is just a cut scene.  Some of the endings intertwine and expand on eachother, like "ending triangles," if you will.  These include [Heihachi, Kazuya, and Jin] and [Lei, Steve, and Nina].  And one more thing, TEKKEN FINALLY HAS INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS!!!  It's just about the last fighter not to and it really adds to the game.  This game was great, but if your not interested in the story and just want it for 2p mode, get Tag instead.  The fighting lasts longer and it has way more characters.	1
I love tekken. My favorite fighting game of all time. I started in the beggining, and can say that Tekken Tag is the best one. This game is good, but it is hard to follow up an act like Tekken Tag. There aren't alot of characters. I love the ones there, but they could of added more. Replay value? Once you beat it with everyone there isn't much left to do, except tekken force. Tekken force is NOT new. Tekken 3 had tekken force. This one however has better terrains. It isn't too hard, but it is rather fun compared to 1 on 1. I found that the length made it less enjoyable, I want to play the last level over and over, but instead I have to replay the first ones which take forever. Time attack, survivor, team battle, they the usual. New characters rock. Marduk is like jack replacement, I enjoy fighting him. Christie is, I guess they thought instead of having Eddie, they could make him more popular with a girl. This does make the game better in arcade though. Alot of guys, instead of using Eddie 24/7, have now decided to use other characters. Steve is probably the best thing about the game. Hes a boxer, and because of this, he has no kicks. He however, can dodge, which is the coolest and most fun thing in the game. You can duck all kinds of ways, spin around, sway, and you can combine them to have your character spaz out. The great thing is, you can actually dodge most attacks. Parrying is also pretty fun. I still love counter attacks, and this game made my love of Tekken rise slightly. Most players are turned off by Steve because he has no kicks. It is really fun playing against humans. Some of those kids at the arcade freak out and tell you to stop moving and such. Steve is really great once you learn the techniques. Almost forgot, sidestepping is much easier. Press up or down to sidestep. You can still jump and crouch, but with tekken 4, I have learned they are not needed really.	1
We are still playing with the same people that we had in Tekken 3...ummm..why?. Shouldn't we now have new players to keep the game fresh?. Anyways, thats the only bad thing i have with the game..other than that..its killer graphics are amazing.	1
Tekken 4 may not be the most groundbreaking fighting game on the market (or the long running series for that matter), but it succeeds where most other fighting games fail.  When all the fighters are finally unlocked, there is a nice selection of diverse fighters; each of whom move very fluidly and each fighting style is diverse enough yet simple to learn: one of the many qualities that has always been a staple of the Tekken series.  As I said before, the graphics are very nice and the fighters well animated, and the 3-D backgrounds are nicely designed as well.  The rendered animation sequences (another staple of the series) are nicely done as well for the most part, but they are too short and the voice acting that goes with it isn't anything to write home about.  The newly designed Tekken Force mode is a step above Tekken 3's version, and is a blast to play.  Tekken 4's only real flaw is that there is nothing here that is revolutionary or groundbreaking, and while that really isn't much of a flaw as a whole, it is something that is expected of the series for something new and great to come along.  All in all, Namco has crafted another more than solid fighting game, and it is a worthy addition to any PS2 fighting fan's library.	1
Tekken 4 can't top TTT, but it is a solid fighter and another sequel to my favorite fighting game series. The few new characters add new moves to the series, and their involvment in the tournament branches new storylines. Jin Kazama looks by far the coolest since his last appearance in TTT. The fighting system introduced walls to the game, no more free roaming. All in all, a very good game.	1
This is a 2d fighter that feels 3d because of the amazing enviornment interactions.  A must have for any fighting fan.  My only complaint is the absence of Tag battles.  But it dosen't matter that much.  It's the most advanced figher you can currently buy so go ahead and get it.	1
although the graphics have improved,(and it is still better then Vurtua fighter) it lacks the graetness of its origonal conterparts.  but i would still buy it.	1
There is nothing special about Tekken 4.  Sure, the graphics are nice and there's some new stuff, but seriously, nothing about this game is impressive.  The character selection includes 3 new guys who are NOT all that wonderful, a couple of guys from Tekken 2, and the rest are all fresh from Tekken 3.  Everyone got a few new moves (most of which are pretty cool) and new outfits, but I would say that is not enough to warrant a purchase.  Story mode livens things up with drawn story scenes and CG scenes for each character.  Tekken Force mode is simply annoying, nothing more.  Beat the $h! t out of a bunch of mindless fools who come running at you... beat up some more guys, and so on and so on.  The new sidestepping, wall obstacles, positions changins stuff is also rather irritating; the computer knows how to do this far too well  and when it uses it, the match is all but lost.  I've always enjoyed Tekken, but a better fighting-control-sceme-thingie and more and better new stuff would've made this worthwhile.  This is a rental at best.	-1
Like many Tekken fans I was a bit disappointed that there were only a limited amount of characters you could pick on Tekken 4, that said, this game is pretty decent. The old characters look a whole lot better especially Paul Phoenix with his hair down looks more intimidating. King seems to have better moves but Law looks constipated and stiff in his fighting stance. The new characters one in particular, I forgot her name but she's HOT. Though I'd recommend Tekken Tag, this wasn't a terrible game, it just could've been a little better.	1
The latest addition to the Tekken series brings an updated version of the fighting game. All the standard fare is available as the prior four games (Tekken, 2, 3, and Tag) - including the extremely irritating Tekken Force mini-game. The graphics have been revisited, and some interactivity has been added...the game (graphics and interativity-wise) seems to be trying for the DoA title, but falls short. However, the updating has not come at the expense of the Tekken feel - still the best controls of all the fighting genre (in my opinion). Still solid, but could have been more...so 4 stars I give it. :)	1
This game has exellent graphics and such and such, but there's not a whole lot to do though Pros: Some of the best graphics i've ever seene same ol' controlls, great gameplay Tekken force is back with a diffrent name beautiful backrounds Very detailed There's enough modes to last Theater mode has improved Great voice acting U can beat someone up on the wall, and kill em' must I say anything about the girls Storymode is a new feature, well not that new Cons: No tag mode When something breaks, it looks fake Less selectable characters for tag Few new cahracters Not much to unlock It seems as though nothins new, makin it only look like a beter Takken 3 No new modes like Tekken Ball or bowl Overcomplicated story who the hell's the winner And it's a bit slower than Tekken 3 and Tag Overall:It's as not as good as Tekken Tag, but it's still a great game.  Vurtua Fighter 4 and Tekken 4 are the best fighting games of this year	1
I've always been a big fan of the Tekken series, even TTT, which seemed to be universally ridiculed when it launced with the PS2 a few years ago. To say that T4 was "highly anticipated" is an understatement. It the granddaddy of PS2 fighters, and in the past the series has always offered something new and different. Not this time. If you've play T3 on PS1, then you'll be familiar with pretty much everything in offered here. Tekken's control system is firmly established now and while both satisfying and easy to use, it lacks the sense of complete control that Sega 's VF4 provides. While playing through the single player game, it soon feels more like a rhythmic button-masher session than a orchestrated fight. With each new game in the series, the back story has gotten more and more complicated (and I've played em all a billion times, so beileve me I know) so much so that in T4 the intricate web of tales hardly explains why all these fighters are beating each other up, and has no relavance whatsoever. If your a longtime fan (like me) though, some of it is mildly intresting, and in many cases the story provides a sense of closure for long-standing characters in the series. You'll get the most fun, like with any fighting game playing against a friend (and if you don't have those, there's always T4's Force mode, and I truly do feel sorry for you). The character selection offers a broad range of fighting styles and the walled arenas provide some intreting possibilities for completely one -sided matches. That said, it's a good fighting game but in the end it's just T3 with new 3D backgrounds, characters and environments and that's about it. VF4 blew the pants off this one. Maybe next time Namco.	1
i rented this game a couple days after it came out. i love tekken tag tourn. my fav character is eddy and i can play that for hours. but this, tekken 4, is a big dissapointment. the game is made to work faster the ttt(tekken tag tourn.), the graphics are worse than ttt: the scenery is a hell of alot better but the charecter visuals are so much worse that ttt. the gameplay doesnt seem to be the same. i played it for aboout 15 min and feel like i wanna take it back already. LISTEN TO ME, DO NOT BUY THIS, RENT IT FIRST, AND IF U LIKE IT THEN DO WAHT EVER. the new gameplays included in tekken 4 are tekken story and tekken force. i have no idea why they made tekken story mode, cause its EXACTLY the same as the reg game, with one small difference, they show 2d pictures and have a lame reason for why they join the tournement. tekken force is pethitic, it is alot better in tekken 3. in this one in tekken 3, it is viewed from behind the guys u have, at his back. it is so hard to control the guys, as well it is the lamest excuse for excitment on the market.	-1
I first happened upon the Tekken series with Tekken 2 on the original PlayStation, and - despite my familiarity with fighting games - enjoyed it, in large part because I was able to have some measure of success with the game almost immediately.  I never tried Tekken 3, but Tekken Tag Tournament was the same - with the added bonus of Tekken Bowl :-) Tekken 4 continues this line of ease of playability, even for those like myself who are not hardcore enthusiasts of martial arts games.  In fact, I specialize in racing and driving games, which require far less coordination and memorization and quick on-the-fly button combinations.  Still, while Tekken 4 slightly raises the bar in terms of ease of playability, it is still possible for a newcomer to the series to have some success almost from the beginning. To that end, Tekken 4 is VERY different from Virtua Fighter 4.  Remembering watching a former girlfriend repeatedly demolish all comers with the arcade version of Virtua Fighter 2, I bought Virtua Fighter 4 on release... and was floored at just how difficult it was.  Even with Pai (reportedly the easiest character to use in Virtua Fighter 4), that game is certainly NOT for us casual players of martial arts games, even though it is superior to the Tekken series in terms of graphics and fluidity of movement (and a true training mode).  Tekken 4 is more like the Dead or Alive series, but with less flesh and extremely little breast-bouncing (although there is some of both in Tekken 4). One of the fun quests of Tekken 4 is unlocking all the characters.  For experts of martial arts games (and the Tekken series in general), this will certainly not require a lot of time; for us casual players, however, this is a fun process which could take up to a week.  Once characters are unlocked, the next quest is defeating Story Mode with each character to unlock the ending movies, which are all definitely interesting... and some completely hilarious :-) While Tekken 4 does not have an equivalent to Tekken Bowl (from Tekken Tag Tournament), Tekken Force is a novel addition to the series, in which the player must infiltrate a military compound using only martial arts techniques; this is certainly inspired at least in part by the opening movie for the game.  The standard Arcade Mode and Time Trial Mode are included, along with a customizable Practice Mode.  However, Training Mode consists of simply inputting the displayed button combinations as quickly as possible, a downfall of the game compared to the in-depth Training Mode of Virtua Fighter 4.  That said, Virtua Fighter 4 would be at least worth a rental for novice players of martial arts games to gain at least the basics of playing fighting games - in much the same way as completing the License Tests in any game of the Gran Turismo series will generally help with virtually ALL games in the racing/driving genre. Perhaps the best thing about Tekken 4 is the detail afforded to the sound engineering.  The ambient sounds are all spot-on for each fighting locale, and the characters' voices even change appropriately.  For example, the Mall, Laboratory, and Parking Area fighting venues all feature prominent echoes, yet the echoes are distinctly different in each venue.  The sound of water in the Mall, Jungle, and Beach venues distinctly different as well, and the volume of the water sounds also fluctuates depending on where the characters are located within each locale. Overall, Tekken 4 is definitely a good game, even for novices in the martial arts genre of gaming.  For those who take their time in unlocking the various elements of the game, Tekken 4 will definitely have a lengthy replay life.	1
So what's different about Tekken 4 compared to Tekken 3 and Tag-Tournament? Well, the most obvious difference is the addition of walled in arenas. No longer do you have to fight on those weird looking infinite arenas. Now you can pummel your opponent up against walls, phone booths, trees, and many other obstacles. Also new to Tekken 4 is the position change technique. This is a new move that every fighter can perform that allows you to push your opponent where you want them (this can come in handy when being cornered up against a wall). New characters that make their debut in Tekken 4 are Craig Marduk (a huge Vale Tudo fighter that has a much better variety of throws and powerful attacks than Jack ever had), Steve Fox (a boxer who uses mainly punches but possesses incredible speed), and Christie Monterio (a female Eddy Gordo replacement). Most of the older characters have only a few new attacks, but Jin has been changed almost completely. He now uses a form of traditional karate...but don't worry, he's just as fast and powerful as before. The graphics are now more crisp and defined than ever. Few objects in the backround show any signs of blurriness at all. The music of Tekken 4 isn't very memorable, but at least it fits the mood for each stage. Unfortunately, the Tekken Force mode is a fun distraction, but it becomes boring after 10 or 15 minutes of pummeling of waves of cookie cutter goons. The older characters could have used a little more revamping, and I would have liked to see at least 1 or 2 more entirely new characters...but I believe Tekken 4 packs enough new features to satisfy fans of the series. Definitely buy it if fighters are your genre.	1
From my many hours and dollars worth of arcade experience I can safely say that Tekken 4 is a very satisfying game with great improvements over previous installments. The fighting system allows for individual players to adopt their own strategies and learn to best use each player to be effective in those strategies (I.E. Defensive v. Aggressive style players, etc.). I can't help but compare this game to Virtua Fighter 4, which I still consider to be the definitive fighting game so far. Tekken has a diverse range of characters, true, but they can all be used similarly. When I say this, I mean that a player needs only learn to use moves and combos to effectively hammer away an opponents defenses and win matches. There is less strategy than brute force, and this is in some ways a very admirable thing. However, the game lacks the solid fighting system and overall grace that VF4 reigns in. I once read a review that stated that Tekken was to hip-hop as Virtua Fighter is to Ballet. That's the best comparison between the two I've seen. I think this game is definetely worthy of a place in the library of any fighting game afficionado simply because it embraces a certain brutal aspect of the fighting genre.	1
To understand DGMNW3, you have to understand the review... First off, the game has many battle tactics, you get 3 DIGIMON to work with, choose and then go out and run around... Battle includes 1-on-1 battles, level up first, then go in for the kill! Train at the gym, Leomon stands in-front, then level up ablilities. Fighting can use "DIGI-Volving" but definitely uses attacks... Then there's card battle... Choose cards and use them to your liking! Once done, you'll fully get the game... Get it if you like RPG's or if your a huge DIGIMON fan... Personally, I thought I'd lose all interest in DIGIMON, I actually think Guilmon Kicks!	1
Tekken 4 is almost here. Some people will say it is the same old Tekken, just a prettier Tekken 3. This is simply not the case. Tekken 4 has evolved more than any Tekken to date. Perhaps only us Tekken veterans will notice, but the fact remains, Tekken 4 brings some major changes and enhancements over previous games in the series. Tekken 4 is the result of a lot of years of tweaking into something quite polished.  First, the visuals.  Tekken 4 looks extremely good. If you played PS2's VF4, you'd notice the rough visuals as far as textures and jaggies.  Tekken4's visuals puts PS2's VF4 to shame with no jaggies of shimmering and detailed textures with very expansive backgrounds.  The characters aren't quite as detailed as VF4 but the animation seems a bit better.  Easily the best looking fighter on the PS2. Tekken 4 is also the first progressive scan compatible game for PS2.  Lets hope this trend continues.  There is also an option to flick on/off the flicker filter of the game.  Put it on and the game has no jaggies or shimmering and everything has a smooth look.  Turn it off& everything will be really sharp but there will be some shimmer.  Either way, the game is beautiful if not a little barren in a couple stages.  But the reflections and water in the mall arena, from the glass in the windows, or the floor, or the gold lining in the shops, I've been heartily impressed.  The smoothness and detail of the statues, its surprising how much it imitates the real sculpture's attention to human skin.  The little details like the hatch being open to airplane, or "Geken" playing at the movie theater in Shinjuku...the game just looks amazingly clear and sharp.   O.k, the gameplay; Christie is a great improvement over the odiously cheap Eddy, and the game benefits greatly from a much improved attention to balance.  Ling Xiaoyu has been improved into one of my favorite fighters now, I was surprised how much I had in learning her.  Meanwhile, Steve Fox is a bright edition to the line-up, his evasion moves and inability to kick bring back memories of playing Street Fighter Turbo...and I think he's managed to be a very interesting and fresh character.  Hwoarang is definitely my favorite of the bunch, though, great design, excellent attention to his moves, it feels like he was drafted from Soul Calibur into Tekken!  While, yes, the game still has repeat characters, that's a Namco fighter for you.  Plus, the different heights, 3D movement, breakable elements, wall hits and position/turn-partner moves really do add a lot to the gameplay and has evolved the Tekken series immensely.  Its really advanced over what I was used too and the character line-up may be the best yet.  (It just needs Kunimitsu!)  I've had a lot of fun playing through Story Mode and Tekken Force through the past two weeks and I think I'm going to end liking this one as much as Tekken 2, which was something of a favorite back in the PSX era.  Too bad there's no Kunimitsu though and Marduk needs to crawl back into the womb of whatever cockroach conceived him.  The endings, despite their acting and the narrator sounding like gentle psychiatrist, rock in a way Tekken endings haven't for quite a while now.  I'll often just watch them a few times over, I especially like Law and Xiaoyu's endings.  Also, Steve's ending was kind of Shokku!  I didn't expect that, but I guess should have.  Its cool, because the Tekken storyline is actually pretty noteable compared to the weak stuff you see in most fighters, the characters and story are what attracted me to the series in the first place.  Of course, Tekken still isn't as deep a game as VF, but with 4 it finally has the goods to be comparable.  Oh and the music!  Currently, as I type the Airport music is stuck in my head.  The ending song is also top rate, as is the impossibly cool edition of the Tekken 2 remixes.  Namco Sound Team are very talented with electronica/techno/whatever Americans call it, I like their Pac Man club remixes, they're hilarious!  Another cool thing about PS2's Tekken 4 is that Namco also included some Tekken 1 and Tekken 2 music for nostalgia's sake.  Lei's, Jack's, Heihachi's, Kazuya's, Nina's, Paul's, and Law's TK2 BGMs are all in there.  Then there's a bunch of tracks from TK1, probably more than what's there from TK2.  The 'statue' stage plays a number of Tekken 2 arcade music (not arranged).  The ones I've heard so far are Lei's, Jack-2's (I think) and the sub-boss music. The training mode is actually pretty good. I like how you can record moves, there are some recommended combos to show beginners possible linking techniques, and the playback demonstration is there (though not in training, wonder why).  For some reason, I've gotten madly addicted to getting as fast a time as I can going through the 20 moves on training mode, its just gets me in zen mode.  So far, my fastest time is 28 seconds with Steve Fox. All in all, Tekken 4 sports enough gameplay improvments and additions that the series desperately needed and has come together wonderfully. If you're a Tekken fan, you'll need this game.	1
What's hot: -The graphics -The new looks(Arenas and menus) -Better controls -The new fighters(Steve Fox and Craig Marduk) -Cool story and plot organization What's not: -Not enough new characters -Some things are just so redundant such as the extras What's strange: -Don't you wish this was like Soul Calibur? -Why must they edit the characters(maybe not Jin, but people such as Bryan)? -Ever wish there was a tag team mode? Overall: I think this is a cool game altogether.  What really brings it down is it's redundancy with extras.  If this had some really new stuff and not just the walls and telephone booths, I would give this a 5.	1
i don't know about tekken 4, but tekken 1, 2, 3 and tag are the best games ive ever played. They keep u playing for hours after hours days after days. I was the one of the first people to buy tekken tag and im gonna be one of the first ones to buy tekken 4. The graphics are amazing and the storyline is alright. A MUST BUy!	1
Reviewed By Robert Marney. Yes, the game looks great, in every sense. Yes, it's got "new" features like walls, useful sidesteps, and Just Frame moves (moves that require precise timing instead of complicated commands), but then again, these were all in VF3 more than five years ago. There are new characters, and some completely revamped old ones, which is good to see, and there's the usual plethora of fun extra modes, like Tekken Force. Unfortunately, a fighting game is all about combat, and this is where Tekken 4 falls short. The CPU is even stupider than it was in previous Tekken games (the game can be beaten using only Heihachi's b+2 backfist and 1,2 jabs). Against humans, the lack of character balance is very apparent: Jin and Steve dominate all others to the point of absurdity, and some characters on the low end like King and Kuma have no chance against any of the top 5, even with Kuma's 75% damage two-hit combo. If you're not interested in playing Tekken 4 seriously and just want to have some fun, this game is great. If you want to put some serious time and effort into a fighting game, though, there are much better options on the PS2.	-1
Classic game  and very good to me.	1
loved it	1
Pretty much as I was expecting. There were scratches on the disc, but the only thing they seem to have affected up is the opening cutscene that appears before the menu, & the manual was a bit faded, but still colorful & in otherwise decent condition. It's pretty difficult to tell whether the scratches are that damaging since RPG style games are so long, but I'm counting it as a lucky find so far.  I used to have this one years back, but never once beat it in all the years I owned it. Glad to have it back in my collection.	1
Great game	1
We boguht it for my Son's Bithday  but some one stold it so got to replace it  He really loves this game	1
this game was awesome when i was a kid and i still find the concept fun. it is a rare and valuable video game as well and well worth buying it.  the only problem was this seller i used gave me an acceptable disk when he claimed it was good condition. i cant watch the opening scene without the game freezing. shame. i hope as i get farther more things don't go bad.	1
Great game very hard to find worth its weight in gold in my opinion. Game is an Rpg style game where your character fight 1v1 with enemies etc. This game has some new digimon, most of the ones from the tv shows Seasons 1-3, I have not finished the game yet but I like they story and it is a lot of fun. If your a Digimon fan I am sure you will like this game	1
Of all the odd games I've played that I still enjoy today (I've got a good handful of unknowns on my list of favorites), Digimon World 3 is still one of the more intriguing ones.  Digimon will always and forevermore be remembered as a poor ripoff of Pokemon, which is a real shame, given the original incarnate of Digimon was a Tamagotchi (virtual pet) that could battle. To my knowledge, it actually began even before Pokemon. The first Digimon World is much closer to this original concept than any other path Digimon ever took (the second is trash. Don't even touch it).  What makes the third installment so good is the number of interesting things it includes. For one, its a 2D RPG with 3D battles. 2D console games period became a rarity once 3D became the norm. (I'm very interested in the new Mega Man 9 on XBox Live for this reason, which is an entirely new game the runs on the original Nintendo engine, with old-school graphics galore and pure retro!) The 3D battles are probably the weakest point of the game because of the visuals more than the actual fighting system.  The story is very well conceived. It's no Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger, nor is it very open-ended like Morrowind or Oblivion, but it's still very solid with some interesting twists along the way. The boss battles are, surprisingly, difficult, a rarity among RPGs these days, I've found (save for MMOs. NEVER try taking on Pandemonium Warden or Absolute Virtue if you play Final Fantasy XI). There's not so much true need for grinding unless you want a specific digimon, but you will still find a challenge in the game.  Digivolutions are strange and branch off as you level them up. You're given your main digimon form that always levels up. You are also allowed three slots for possible digivolutions, save for its normal evolutions, which come standard. As you use them, the digivolutions you have equipped grow in level (faster than your main form, you'll find) and learn both new moves and even more new digimon forms. Mapping it out in full takes lots of time and is much more tedious than Pokemon catching ever was or will be.  The sound is decent at best. I've definitely heard better, but at the very least, it works. Again, this isn't Final Fantasy we're talking about here.  The card battles (possibly influenced by the inclusion of card games in FFVIII and IX, as well as the actual Digi Card Battle game. The cards in this game actually borrow their images from the latter) are quick, easy and relatively painless. They're a great way to pass the time and can really become quite addicting.  At some point, though, the whole "Digi-whatever" cheese factor is just gonna get to you. Even a couple of the main ideas (how the final boss comes to be, the whole virtual reality concept, etc.) really seem to stretch certain "real life" possibilities, but this is normal of a Digimon game. The difference here, though, is that the Digimon world is a man-made game vs. a sort of alternate reality.  Even with that in mind, though, the game REALLY stands strong in my memory. A lot of places stock it used for cheap (Gamestop, when they were cleaning out their PS1 inventory, had it for $10) and its worth the price.  If you can find it and you like RPGs, get it. It's a bit more on the casual end, (it's no Phantasy Star II by any stretch) but it works and plays well.  ****4 stars****	1
The only problem I have had with this game is the fact that I am apparently too dimwitted to solve the case in time!! It's been challenging,but that's okay with me. As for the performance of the game itself? I am running Windows XP,on a 1.8 P4,w/256 RAM. The game installed quickly,and has run flawlessly. So..if you don't have hardware problems,and are a fan of L&O,and love to figure out "who done its,"this is the game for you.	1
I've never revised a review before, but I felt I had to this time.  First off, do not think that the requirement listed on the package are all that's required for an enjoyable gaming experience here.  If you do not have one of the newer video cards, don't even bother.  Based on the requirements listed on the box, I should have been able to play this game without a problem.  But after dealing with a spinning screen, a game that paused for long stretches of time, and even a screen that went white, I called tech support only to find out (after buying the game) that I needed a newer video card if I really wanted to play.  Even after downloading and installing a few drivers provided by Legacy Interactive, I couldn't get it to run as it was supposed to. Then there is the trial section.  At least during the investigative half, you can pause the game or walk away from it for a while, and you have plenty of opportunities to save your game.  Save BEFORE you go to trial, and if you think you're going to be distracted DON'T go to trial.  Save your game, go live your life and come back to it later.  Because once you're in trial phase, you can't save or quit the game until that phase of the trial is over.  And again, if you don't have a newer video card, you'll be frustrated when you do get to trial because the 3D animation be jerky and will skip to such a degree that you will inevitably miss some of the testimony of the defense witnesses and some of the defense attorney's questions.  (And you can't object to what you don't hear.  Not effectively anyway.) I played through to the end of the trial phase, and all the way to the verdict just once, because I wanted finish at least one game.  And I then uninstalled the game and got rid of it.  If I want the "Law and Order experience" I'll catch the show itself on television.	-1
I gave four stars because I want them to continue to make these types of games and without the bugs it is a fun game. I only play and buy adventure and mystery games. The second one didn't have any bugs for me and they made a few improvements, for example they got rid of the time limit and added checkmarks to the notepads. If you have Javaw.exe error or Can't Start? Try This. After applying the necessary patches for the 2-CD or 3-CD: I have the 3 cd version and would get the javaw.exe error and application has to close message, so I couldn't even start the game (played it before but didn't finish, but didn't have that problem the first time.) Solution=You have to always start the game with the first disc after quitting game. open cd disc drive on my computer or windows explorer open disc one open install folder open lawandorder (the application) then wait and opening will start	1
The game itself is great, graphics, sounds, and concept is just like the TV show.  The major issue I have with it is the fact that it constanly locks up.  I'm running a PIII 733, 512mb Ram, 32 mb Video Card, 16 mb Sound card, and don't have such problems with other games which require a higher minimum system requirement.  Due to these technical issues I've encountered with the game, I have not been able to complete it.  It becomes extremely fustrating, especially if you've got something and getting hotter and closer to cracking the case.  If it wasn't for all this lock up, the game would be great.  The game is worth 1 star, even if there was an option for no stars, it still is worth 1 the 1 star I gave it.	-1
I love this game. It has a few bugs, but that just means you should save a lot. But that's good for any game. This game makes you really think. It can be very hard to figure out just what you need because there are a lot of false clues lying over the place. The next installment of L&O is going to be even better because they have elimanated the time limits. That means you can investigate to your heart's content without worry that you'll be pulled off the case. And you'll be able to redo interviews with people. For instance, in this game if you don't ask the maintenance worker to move his cart, you can't move forward in the game because under his cart is something you need to identify the victim. But in L&O 2 you can just redo that conversation without having to either start over or begin from a save point. I can't wait for the new game. It looks to be better than the first which is awesome in itself.	1
This computer game is based on the popular TV series. The gameplay does a good job of having you feel like you're in an exciting episode of the show. The characters and voices are right from the TV show, so you really feel like you're part of the action. You head out to the crime scene - a woman was killed while jogging in Central Park. You search the scene for evidence, and then start talking to various suspects. You can choose your strengths, so you can know which questions not to ask, or you can get help finding evidence by having them highlighted. You have your crime lab and research lab examine evidence, and your surveillance team watches the people. As you find more clues, you track down more people to talk to. Get enough evidence, and you can request a search warrant, and eventually accuse someone of the crime. That's when things get turned over to the lawyers. Now you try to prosecute this criminal, calling witnesses, discussing evidence, objecting to bad questioning. If you do a good enough job, you can nail the perpetrator! The game definitely draws you along, You eagerly await the results of the tests you request, and wonder what the people you are talking to are hiding. You have an inkling of what you are looking for, and dig around until you track it down. On the downside, the game is extremely single-threaded. The only way you can talk to person X is to investigate item Y - but you have no idea that it's item Y you need to submit out of the 50+ items you find at the scene. You can't carry them all, and you get scolded for picking up each item or submitting too many to evaluate. Where in a normal crime scene you'd figure the crew would gather up all evidence and sift it for you, here you get deducted moments for each "thing" on the ground (you don't know what it is until you pick it up) you even look at! So it almost forces you to play each half of the game many times - a few times to figure out what all the items *are* and which are important, and then a last time to actually just touch the items you now know "by osmosis" are important to your case. The same is true during questioning of various people - questions that seem to be quite related end up causing the person not to answer questions that you actually need. They randomly decide at a point not to talk to you further - even if you have more questions for them. For example, a cleaner has his cart parked on a key point of evidence. But ask him the wrong questions and you cannot ask him to move his cart, even though he's still standing right there! Finally, even though I use my system for many, many games of all types, this one crashed on me very frequently. It just meant even more frequent saves and restores, beyond what the gameplay already forced on you through its single-mindedness. Recommended to a fan of the show, and a great concept. Hopefully future releases will address some of these issues and give the game more open gameplay, as in real world detecting.	1
A lot of people are talking about DTR as though it was a Max Payne clone. Aside from the issue of "bullet-time", or the slow-motion diving-while-shooting, DTR and Max share virtually nothing in common. Ok, so both are stories about ex-cops out for revenge, but that's where the similarities end. Dead to Rights has a lot more built-in diversity in gameplay than Max Payne does. The character can fight unarmed, have his sidekick dog attack enemies, disarm enemies and steal their guns, and hide against walls and kill people stealthily. That's not to mention the plethora of minigames, which take most of their gameplay from the venerable Track and Field series of button-mashing to some specified parameters. DTR doesn't have half the atmosphere that Max Payne does, and that's largely due to the art direction and cinematography, rather than anything else. A lot of the cutscenes are done in-engine, and while DTR's not ugly, it's not pretty, either. Visually, it's about half-way between Halo and a Dreamcast game. The most important thing to consider, however, when trying to decide whether to purchase DTR, is that it's staggeringly difficult. The biggest problem with DTR is that the difficulty comes not from a legitimate, skill-based challenge, but from a lousy camera, and poor auto-targetting. At times, you will dive at a person with a shotgun, who is standing not far in front of you. You might be armed with a shotgun as well, so range would be an important consideration, since you'll do more damage to something closer to you. But rather than targetting the guy in front of you, where one hit would kill him, you end up targetting someone off-camera, to your left, who's behind a truck. Of course, after flying through the air like an idiot, you land at this guy's feet, where he kills you with one close-range shotgun blast. The problem with DTR is that it's so full of potential, and so full of neat ideas, and they're mired in this half-baked mess, where you can't DO any of the things that you *want* to do. It's a neat game, on paper - full of potential, full of excellent ideas. But as it stands, it's frustrating not because of a legitimate challenge, but because every couple of minutes, you'll be killed by something you couldn't possibly avoid.	-1
Hardest game I ever beat hands down!!! I still have nightmares about how much I HATE this game. The second I beat it I took the game out, slammed it into it's cover (of which I had thrown across the room several times along with the pile of controllers) and traded it in. Don't know why I stuck with it till the end. Just didn't want the game to beat me I guess. To this day have not been half as angry as when I played this god forsaken game. Hate hate hate HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
This Has to be the worst Max Payne Rip-off in History. Poor Graphics, Linear Story, & a Cheese-ball Character. Plus, The auto aim is annoying. There isn't anything awesome you're missing if you skip this game.	-1
I 1st purchased this game because a friend told me it was good. This game is packed with action great game play and good graphics. I played this 1 until I finished it. I will now purchase part 2.	1
You play as a cop in this game. You can rob a car just like in Grand theft auto. The worst problem of this game is the graphic. It does not have many details. The car you're driving look almost the same as others on the street. They are all black or dark brown! Id rather play Maxpayne 2 or Burnout 3	-1
Dead to Rights is about a cop named Jack Slate that is in somewhat similiar situation as Max Payne (except he has a dog). The gameplay is different from Max Payne and the game overall has alot of pluses and minuses. PLUS: The disarms are great, it can always get you out of a tough situation, also the dog attack is an automatic killer you also get their weapon. The bullet time is done nicely (nothing to add more than its bullet time). The different choice of arsenals are great. The AI are also very intelligent and has great AIM which makes this game a bit challenging at times. MINUS: Some graphics and cutscenes are just flat out horrible. Like the cars, and the cutscenes when they talk and their mouth doesnt move(Mind speaking?). Camera: you constantly have to find yourself switching to the default cameral because you are getting killed because you went around the corner... Stupid Submissions: some of the submissions are okay, like picking a lock and disarming the bomb, but the weight lifting and the punching bags and those type just test how long can your thumb last without getting tired or hurt. Storyline: very similiar to Max Payne. A framed cop going after corrupted people with alot of power in their hand who hires people to kill you, and you find a mysterious girl who helps you named Eve but never gets to completely to know her (reminds you of Mona Sax???) and how you look for revenge. Overall: Overall, i thought this game was great with some errors that could be ignored and overcame. It just takes alot of patience because some missions in this game just seem impossible until you find out your suppose to leave instead of keep fighting (OOOOOO!!!!) but the difficulty of the game is very high with very intelligent AI. Gameplay: 8.5 Graphics: 7.5 Storyline: 8.5 Sound: 8.0 Replay Value: 8.5 *if you want to see the amazing disarming moves. OveralL: 8.2	1
I totally hated the camera angles of this game, they were awful. There really is not much of a strategy to follow to beat Dead To Rights. Just a lot of button mashing and ducking. This seemed more like a typical FPS. The story was pretty stupid and while I applaud the efforts of adding stuff like arm wrestling, lock picking, being a stripper, etc. to spice the game, it just made the game not only brainless but cheesy. I was expecting better.	-1
Luckily, this game is found to be the most masterful for those who are new to mastering video games at this rating. Finally, it provides a variety of skills to pass the entire thriller. Unfortunately, most of the M-rated games are callous, sometimes take a very, very, very long time to master each one, involve much of the perplexities and acquire so much energy. As a result, this is a very important recommendation regarding the issue of the adult video gaming and for individuals who plan to master the fighting, action, horror and other types of video games in their future lives. Thank for your time and patience!	1
This game has a great concept but the game play and controls really stink!  It's a 3rd person perspective shooter game with very poor camera views.  Most of the time you won't even know where the enemy is firing at you from.  To make things worse, the right thumbstick, which is used to control the camera view, is backwards, pressing right makes the camera go left and vise versa.  The graphics are definitely PS2 graphics, this game shouldn't have been released for the Xbox.  Overall, if you're looking for a great shooting/adventure game, I'd recommend Splinter Cell.	-1
Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Overall: 7.5/10 I'd like to start off by saying that the "Failed" screen of the game (equivalent to Game Over) simply isn't pretty enough for the amount of times you're going to see it. If you can overlook the several flaws it presents you'll be rewarded with the best action\shooting game since perhaps Max Payne. Graphics: 8/10 The graphics of the game aren't all that special, the nicest thing that I have nothiced was perhaps the shading on the characters throughout the game. The game's graphics' value is diminished by some low-level models such as the cars on the streets or even some of the buildings themselves which are paved with mostly average textures. If bump-mapping would have been used this game could have really have had impressive looks even on the not so well designed levels. Sound: 7/10 Truly and honestly the sound of this game is one of the draw backs, not for the actual sound effects themselves but for the somewhat annoying music. As far as the voice acting goes, it's obvious that they tried to maintain the melodramatic Max Payne feel to it with not as great success, for at times the voice seems to lack a sense of feeling, or seems downright out of place or badly timed. Gameplay: 8/10 By far this is where the game truly shines. The game's gameplay is very similar to that of Max Payne, but it has an extra Kung-Fu twist to it. Both of the games feature a slow-mo mode however Dead to Rights also features some really awsome disarms and human shield abilities. Despite the entertaining Max Payne style fighting\shooting system DtR suffers from some major camera issues, you can only pivot the angle around the character (left or right) but not up or down, and often (especially when in halls or other small spaces) the camera become a real nuisance making enemies able to kill you with ease, thus having to restart the phase all over again. And although that may not sound like a big deal it is. The game's difficulty is simply too high, and there is no difficulty level selection. This may (and will) frustrate many gamers and turn some away completely from the game especially the average gamer. But some of the hardcore gamers may welcome the challenge. In the short time I have been playing the game I have seen the "Failed" screen about 20-35 times thus from that you could deduct an idea of how difficult the game is (or not...). Pros and Cons +Lengthy game +Feels very similar to Max Payne +Control scheme seems to work out nicely +Great gameplay +Cool intro movie -Too friggin hard -Bothersome camera angles -Average sound and graphics -Max Payne clone Final Words: In the end despite of all of Dead to Right's flaws I'd say that the game is worth of every (or almost) attention,  I'm not telling you that it's a must have but that you might want to rent it or borrow it from a friend. But I can guarantee that almost everyone who plays this game will get frustrated more that once or twice. Overall: 7.5 Letter grade: D   --Akira	1
If you're looking for immersive gameplay, good story and graphics...then don't buy this game.  At first I thought this would be a Max Payne knock-off, which would be fine because that was a great game.  Unfortunately this game can't even be put into the same category. First off, the graphics are just ok.  There's nothing wrong with them, but I'm playing on an X Box here.  The graphics should be great.  I would even have to say the the graphics on Max Payne for the PS2 are better.  The introduction was interesting and visually very good.  It's too bad that this doesn't carry on into the rest of the game. The storyline is moderately cheesy.  If I'm playing a Mature rated game (which this is) then I'd prefer to have a story made for adults.  Often I would find myself thrown into a situation where I just had to kill everyone in sight.  Once that was done, more bad guys appear and then a few more after that.  All the while I'm not even sure why I'm there in the first place. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the controls on this game.  I agree with everything said.  It didn't take very long to learn all the controls at all.  Rather the controls make this game much more difficult than it has to be and sometimes just make no sense. On the outside this game appears as though it would be very good.  And I suppose that it had the potential to be very good.  It's too bad that so many things were overlooked and made this into a fairly bad game.	-1
I rented Dead to Rights, and I have been impressed with the overall gameplay. The controls are comfortable, and you will pick up the basic moves/commands in a relatively short amount of time. Yes, you will even learn to work with the camera setting which is a bit awkward at first. This game can be both addicting and frustrating, but you will find yourself trying (and trying again...) until you accomplish your mission. Some of the challenges are a bit much (lifting weights, arm wrestling, etc.); however, the game did manage to keep me interested throughout the process. The only complaint that I have is that the game basically directs you/controls you too much. There is not a great deal of room for free-play or exploring outside the boundaries of the game. Because of this "limitation," I would strongly encourage you to enjoy this game as a rental before you decide to make a purchase.	1
Extra Extra Corey Hart breaks out and becomes a cop with his sunglasses at night..,., So the folks at Namco played Max Payne and thought, we can do better, so here it is!  I rented this at block buster and played it for about 4.2 minutes.  The controls are too complicated for a shooter.  I found myself once again putting in Halo to cleanse myself of that garbage.  It makes sense that nobody has rated this game because it is so bad it doesn't merit a review.  Why am I doing this you ask only to say I now have a stack of games but only Halo is worth the replay.	-1
Today is the 4th day I've had this game on rental from Blockbuster, and no doubt about it, it's way too frustrating to be fun.  The graphics is good, the storyline stupid but tolerable, and lurking somewhere you can sense a fun factor, but the difficulty and insanely unpredictable controls make this game sadistically unpleasant to play.  A total letdown. Another thing that pisses me off is, this is a time exclusive title for the Xbox.  While it's nice to have an Xbox-only game even if just for a few months, this game is so poorly programmed that I'm thinking we Xbox fans are being used as guinea pigs.  If the PS2 version plays better than this one, I'll never buy another Namco game again.	-1
If Dead to Rights was a movie, you can bet your lucky stars that Mission: Impossible and the other big action movie rejects would be shuffling along the sidewalk in their bathrobe. Namco's latest bullet riddled action title is one of the most cinematic, action packed over-the-top action games I've ever played. The entire game's adrenaline barometer is clicking at full tilt and doesn't dare slow down to lose that eccentric sensation of pulse inducing gun fights that make us feel like Bruce Willis in Die Hard; and its that quality that makes Dead to Rights a worthwhile game, flaws and all.  Yes, Jack Slate (The main hero/good cop/framed man) is a [copy] of Remedy's Max Payne, he plays more like a reject from the drawing board of Bruce Willis wannabe's. Yes, his one liners are cheesy and he fires them off like there's no tomorrow, not to mention his bullet-time/slow motion dive looks odd. Okay, okay yeah, Jack Slate is a complete retard, but when you shrug off that silly smirk off your face, you'll find yourself clenching your burly Xbox controller and indulged in a piece of action gaming bliss. Dead to Rights takes place in a fictional setting "Grant City", Jack Slate is a wise-ass officer who's father is killed (Of course) and he in turn is framed for murder and gets caught up in a dangerous web of corrupt cops, city officials and more gun fights that Clint Eastwood's even seen. Yeah, the story's not going to win any awards, nor was it meant to, thankfully Namco shifts it focus off the story and more onto the game rather than the heavily story driven roots of ones such as its inspiration Max Payne.  Now that the small talk is out of the way, let's talk action. Dead to Rights best feature is the never-before seen action elements that have been perfectly implemented into the gameplay. Jack can disarm foes barehanded, grab enemies and use them as human bullet shields, use his dog to attack enemies and fight hand to hand if things come to worse (which they will). Now before you criticize, believe me these are not some of the useless features in games, all of these elements give players strategy that seriously helps pull you out of dire straights.  Dead to Rights also is littered with mini-games. Surprisingly many of them are fun and add great depth to the action feel, especially when you're disarming bombs and one false move will blow you to smithereens. Others range from arm wrestling, to weight lifting, resisting torture, picking locks and  But where there's the good, there's always the bad lurking off in the corners somewhere; and I say this loud and clear: Dead to Rights is the most challenging, most difficult and sometimes cheapest game I've played all year. It's nearly impossible to play without getting pissed off and it nearly kills the fun factor too. Only play this if you're comfortable blowing your top often as well as dying often because you'll be doing a hell of a lot of it here. Without difficulty settings that are sorely needed in a game like this, you'll be dying many times even on the second and third levels. The biggest problem is hand to hand combat, the fighting system may seem cool at first, but surprisingly every part that I got angry at was a fighting part. I had no trouble overcoming the imposing odds in gun fights, but in hand to hand you're only given one defensive option to work with, and that's block, only thing is, the block doesn't work. Most annoying is the fact that your enemies swarm you relentlessly and their hits do about half the damage of yours. A few bosses can even kill you in mere seconds, one example was a convict in prison eight punches from him will kill you where as it will take nearly fifty to bring him down (He also has two invulnerable sidekicks constantly attacking you to just to make things more cheap.)  Don't expect this game to go easy on you even in the beginning, Dead to Rights won't spare anyone, not to mention some of the hardest boss fights ever, and I mean damn hard. This is another game that a difficulty setting could have promised this game the same stature of Max Payne, but alas laziness must have taken over, if there was a wake-up call to add difficulty settings, this is it. Yet even with its high frustration level however Dead to Rights is a hard as nails, action filled package just bursting at the seems with style and flair, so I am giving it thumbs up.	1
What's hot: -The action is so darn insane -The thought of minigames and how fun they are -Insane gameplay What's not: -Gameplay gets confusing sometimes -Graphics could use some work What's strange: -Why must it get so frustratingly hard everytime you progress? The awards for: Best minigame-Dance and Distract(The one w/ the stripper) Best move-The Human Shield Best supporting character-Shadow(the dog) The overall: If you liked Max Payne, you haven't seen anything yet.  Once you play Dead to Rights, your life will be changed forever.	1
I think this game game is really good the control can be hard to remeber but I just got my xbox so Im still getting the feel for the controler the only think I don't like about this game is the camra and the targeting system other than that a really cool spin on max payne type of gameplay	1
Dead To Rights seemed like an exciting title in the weeks ensuing its initial release - but after (thankfully) renting this title I found it to be a pleasant experience on the eyes, but nothing else.  The graphics are sharp and detailed, but the gameplay and camera angles leave a lot to be desired.  Not only that, the amount of ammunition it takes to put down a run-of-the-mill peon is near improbable.....two to three shots up close with a shotgun?!  I don't think so. The camera angles are atrocious!  When you have to fight several enemies you have to maneuver your character all around the room (basically running around) to find other guys to battle.  And when you fight them you sometimes cannot even see them until they are in the midst of throwing a blow...that's not cool. Usage of slow motion (a-la Max Payne, a superior title to this one) is helpful and pretty darn cool - you can throw explosive canisters and shoot them, causing an explosion around your enemies, plus you can avoid other bullets that way, as well.  Max Payne seems to be much better at this, though. To sum it up, don't buy this title - ever!  If you are looking for a vigilante cop style game, stick with Max Payne.  It does everything Dead To Rights does and more, just with better success.  DTR was obviously rushed out of development, or it would not have been so terrible.  Rent it first - you might like it.  I'm leaning toward a majority of dislikes, though.  Happy gaming!	-1
To start off I think this is a great fighting game period. This is to say I like it far better than virtua fighter 4(the only other fighting game I have for PS2).  Its shocking how in depth the fighting system is for all the UFC fighters and for the eight or so different kinds of career fighters you can create(you can very the martial art between levels making the possibilities endless.) The graphics are definitely high-end(even for a next-gen system), and the load times are reasonably short. The fighting itself is extremely fluid and very fun.  ITs best to save often in career mode because once in a rare while the game freezes(at least mine ... Long time fans will be dissapointed at the abscence of tank abbott, royce gracie, and ken shamrock -- but all in all it offers tens and possibly hundreds of hours of ankle locking fun(especially if you and your buddys create characters loosely based on yourselves excepy ya know tough too :-) ) grade: A -cj	1
Personally, I found this game good enough to buy -- 4 stars may not be maximum but it's no gas bomb either. However, I felt there could have been more: more stages, more options, and more teams. It's possible that SEGA is holding out for a sequil. Next time, I think the sound options should be put in three categories: music, sound FX, AND announcer (he's so annoying). That being said, SEGA did a tremendous job in applying the physics and making a simple yet effective control scheme. Additionally there a circles indicating where the ball will land, so you don't have to rely on shadows or blind luck like previous volleyball games such as the unofficial Venice Beach game for the NES back in the days of 8 bits. Actually it wasn't so bad, but that's besides the point. Even as a hater of sports games, I highly recommend this game to anyone (female or male) who likes intense, hard-hitting action four-player action with with an all-female cast. Some women may be offended by the skimpiness of the uniforms, but that's a small price to pay. Finally there is a women's sports game that does the gender justice.  Note: This is an ARCADE-style video game, not just because it debuted in the arcades, but because it's very "basic" like most arcade games are. I don't know personally, I've been told though, that there are many more rules to real volleyball than in this particular game.	1
I got Beach Spikers after hearing mixed reviews about it, not sure if I'd love it or hate it. But anyways, I got it, and it's a very nice game. Here's my ratings for each major thing: Graphics- The graphics are very detailed. The player models are very well done, and the minute details, like footprints in the sand, are nice effects. 8.6/10 Play Control- There are four buttons on the GameCube for a reason, and Beach Spikers doesn't take advantage of that, but the control is still fairly easy to pick up and understand. 7.9/10 Game Design- How many volleyball games are out there? Not many, and this one's chock full of stuff, like a Career Mode and a handful of minigames. 8.2/10 Satisfaction- When you're playing the game, you're usually having fun, even when you're losing. That alone is worth a rent. 8.1/10 Sound- The sound effects are kinda nice, but an announcer could've added something. 7/10 Overall- Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, making this a noteworthy game to at least rent.	1
Ever since Sega abandoned console manufacturing, they became one of the most hotly pursued game developers.  When Nintendo unveiled its Gamecube console, everyone could tell these two would be a match made in heaven.  Sega often adopts the same brightly colored, highly playable titles as Nintendo, so it was only a matter of time before Sega masterpieces showed up on the Gamecube.  First came Super Monkey Ball, then Soccer Slam.  And the latest is Beach Spikers, which is hands-down the best vollyball game ever released on consoles. The first thing that grabs you are the graphics.  The female players are rendered beautifully, with amazingly lifelike animation, smooth joints, and facial expressions.  No emphasis on sexiness here - just toned atheletes hungry for victory.  The game runs at a perfectly smooth framerate, never slowing down even in multiplayer.  The stadiums are awesome to behold:  crowds are fully animated, and each stadium features a certain sponsor, ranging from Pringles to Holiday Inn.  There's even a court with a gigantic inflatable Sonic the Hedgehog in the background.  The sand is wonderfully crafted, being displaced and formed by the players as the match progresses.  It's one of the most realistic, stunning sports titles ever made. Anyone familiar with Sega's Dreamcast Virtua Tennis titles will quickly adopt to Beach Spikers' gameplay.  Use the analog stick to move your player and aim your shots, A sets/spikes, B low sets/feints (a "baby" shot designed to go over blockers at the net), and A+B (or X or Y) unleashes a power smash.  The same buttons are used for varying serves.  It's simple to pick up, but takes a while to master completely - just like Virtua Tennis.  Beach Spikers has the same kind of pick-up-&-play charm as Virtua Tennis, Soccer Slam, and Hot Shots Golf:  even non-fans will become scoring threats the moment they pick up the controller.  To be frank, if you're a fan of these games, Beach Spikers is a MUST. There are several different modes as well.  Arcade is, obviously, a perfect conversion of the arcade game.  Choose a team of two girls from various countries and compete in a four-stage tournament.  You're allowed to continue should you lose.  Each game runs till 15 points (you must win by two), but starts with each team at 10 to allow for quicker games.  However, this feature is adjustable in the Options menu, so you can start at zero and play till 30 if you choose.  Vs. Mode allows up to four players at once to play a single match, or one of three interesting mini-games:  an odd race to catch flags on the far side of the court, a tense game where the ball is a bomb and a timer counts down (you don't wanna be caught with the bomb when the time hits zero!!), or a scoring competition, much like Free Kick in soccer.  The mini-games are nice, but the normal head-to-head four-player match is where it's at.  Beach Spiker with four players is one of the best multiplayer parties you can have. There is also a World Tour mode, which fans of Virtua Tennis will be familiar with, but there are some fantastic differences.  You choose a player and a partner, using literally hundreds of hair/facial/costume/sunglasses styles.  You are in control of your player constantly, but the computer controls your partner.  Your partner starts off...well, let's just say she doesn't really know what's going on.  During World Tour matches (there are seven multi-stage tournaments in all), you are given the opportunity to grade your partner's performance.  You can choose to Praise, Encourage, Chastise, or Do Nothing.  If you make the correct choice based on how your partner plays (you'll be using Chastise A LOT in the early going).  These exchanges, which happen at courtside, are great fun to watch.  Your player will jump up and yell at the partner, or give her a hand, and the partner will respond accordingly.  Make the right choice, and your Teamwork meter will rise.  Make the wrong choice (i.e. Chastise when your partner is doing well) and your partner will actually yell BACK.  It's similar to the AI mode of Virtua Fighter 4 (developed by the same division of Sega, AM2), and creates a wonderful connection between you and your players.  After World Tour matches, win or lose, you are awarded points which you can then use to upgrade your partner, RPG style.  It's a fantastic mode that is even better than Tennis 2K2's because there's no repetitious Training to be had.  Just hit the courts and train that partner! Beach Spikers is a gorgeous, easy to play, hard to master creation that excels in almost all capacities.  The only blemishes on this otherwise perfect game are the slightly annoying and repetitious announcer (you'll get sick of hearing FANTAAASTIC very quickly...and there's no way to turn him off), the sometimes hyperactive camera, and the unmemorable soundtrack.  Still, these are small, easily ignorable details that do not at all detract from one of the top single- and multi-player gaming experiences the Gamecube has to offer.  Nintendo and Sega are a match made in heaven.  You want to ogle artificial females, wait for DOA Xtreme.  You want a brilliantly executed game that will stay high on your replay list for months to come, Beach Spikers is where it's at.	1
Alas, the gaming world has left this sport reasonably unexplored, but... this is the realization of the sport.  From very simple controls, to a challenging game with many teams to choose from, and by the way, an extensive create a player mode, much like the Sega Sports Tennis Series.  Participate in numerous tournaments around the world with real sponsors, and have a good time.   I'll be honest, I don't like to lose, and I lost the first 4 games  I played.  It's not as easy as anyone thinks.  It's certainly worth the money though.  If you buy this game for the girls, then well, that's what adult stores are for.  If you want volleyball, the way the original Superspike V Ball wasy for Nintendo, then I would go out and get this one quick.	1
The only good thing about this game is the characters, who are teams of babes in bikini. Sounds good huh? NOT!!! This game is about volleyball, problably the worst sport in the world. The graphics look great, but it doesn't bring much attention to me. If you want a horrible but babe game buy it!	-1
Hands-down, the most annoying game I have ever played. Graphics look like a Playstation clone, controls are all but impossible (especially the camera), and even the storyline isn't very interesting. Targeting bad guys was difficult and fighting seemed like random luck more than skill. I was hoping during the tutorial that the game would get more interesting, but it's basically run, shoot (or punch), duck and wait for the next cut scene to see what next seemingly repetitive ten guys you'll have to runaround for 10 minutes trying to take out one at a time. I gave the game away after three days. Please don't waste your [$$] like I did.	-1
I recently rented this game and I must say It is one of the best games of The year. The game plays out good and no matter what happens you want to keep playing. I did however not like the minigames. +-Storyline Gun Fights Hand To Hand Fights Stages - Bullet Time Minigames	1
This game is the top of the line. Yes it does get a little TOO HARD SOMETIMES, but its a fun game that is definitely worth buying because it takes more than the 5 blockbuster days to beat it and it is fun to play again after you beat it every now-and-then. Some people say its not as good as MAX PAYNE but it is. Not only do you walk around shooting people, you get to play mini-games like disarming bombs, playing as a stripper, shooting from a helicopter, picking locks, hotwiring vehicles, etc. And when you do walk around shooting people you can take them HOSTAGES and excute them when you are done. If you have the money to rent this game for 1 month then maybe you should do it, but in my book this game is a MUST BUY!!	1
Dead to Rights is probably the only game to ever make me feel like I was part of an action movie, Max Payne had its moments, but you never fought 15 guys at once in MP, in DTR it is more than often than not the standard.  For instance, when you have to bust out of the massage parlor with Eve, and take down guys while finding cover behind cars, and popping up and capping guys its truly exhilarating and you feel as though you've overcome some overwhelming odds.  Good stuff.  Now to the bad, the whole hand to hand fighting engine is absolutely awful, it is a diversion and an absolutely unneeded one, the gun parts stand up on their own without this arbitrary annoyance.  The fighting interludes had me yelling expletives in no time, an example of the completely ludicrous challenge they present is the boss battle with Tattoo, he has two henchmen.  But you can't kill them, they beat the <...> out of you, and all you can do is hit them a few times to knock them over.  Thats just awful, I threw the controller for the first time since I was like 10 years old.  That said, the gun battles are hard, but not controller fury inducing, you feel as though you can actually beat them with a little practice, so its not a lost cause.  The fighting parts just <...>  The graphics aren't bad, and Namco was obviously going for a more arcade feel rather than the world of grit and grime of Max Payne.  The story is pretty standard, although it has its intriguing moments.  There are a bunch of mini-games and diverse missions, and they are all fun, except for the punching ones mentioned earlier.  Last thing, this game is staggeringly violent.  This is the only game where I can take a human shield, then gun down 3 guys and then put the shield on his knees, and blow his head off with a shotgun, its horribly offensive, but cool nonetheless.  So if you're not offended by the utterly gratuitous violence, then give this game a shot, it deserves it.	1
This game has many things going for it, but I am not going to itemize those things.  The reason I rated this game 2 stars (and subsequently cancelled my pre-order) - was solely because of the RIGHT THUMBSTICK.  It infuriates me to no end that I must press (the RIGHT THUMBSTICK) RIGHT to look LEFT and vice versa.  It boggles my mind that there is no menu option to reverse the polarity.  Prisoner of War - has the same exact flaw.  Let me be as clear as I can (in the hopes that video game programmers are reading).  All players want the most "intuitive and flexible" controls possible - so that they can become effecient at killing bad guys.  Pressing RIGHT to look LEFT will NEVER EVER EVER be intuitive for me.  Please AGREE with this comment so that we send a BIG message to the video game makers.  HALO's controls are perfect - don't reinvent the wheel!	-1
AFTER READING MANY REVIEWS MYSELF I WAS KIND OF CROSSED UP WHEN I FIRST PLAYED DEAD TO RIGHTS.LET ME TELL YOU THIS GAME ROCKS YOU TO THE NEXT LEVEL IN GAMING ITS VIRTUAL REALITY AT ITS BEST THERES TIMES IN THE GAME WHEN I WAS LIKE MAN I CANT BELEIVE IT LETS YOU DO THIS.LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SAID THIS GAME IS TO HARD AND VERY FRUSTRATING IM SORRY I DIDNT FIND THAT TO BE TRUE COMPLETELY YES  YOU WILL NOT FLY THRU THE FIRST 10 CHAPTERS BUT THATS WHY ITS CALLED A GAME .THE  WAY IT LETS YOU SHOOT IS THE BEST PART ITS VERY FUN TO AIM AND SHOOT ALSO USING SOMEONE AS A HUMAN SHIELD MAN THATS THE COOLEST.ALSO THE GRAPHICS LIKE EVERYONE IS CONCERNED ARE GREATAND THE OPTIONS ARE GERAT YOU CAN REALLY PLAY THE WAY U WANT TO AND BEST OF ALL IF U GET STUCK ON A CHAPTER AND JUST HATE IT AND WANNA MOVE ON U CAN JUST GO TO THE MENU AND SELECT CHAPTERS AND GO WHERE U WANT ALL IN ALL THIS IS A GREAT GAME WHAT I REALLY WAS EXPECTING WAS FOR IT TO LIVE UP TO ALL THE HYPE THAT HAS BEEN BUILT UP.SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A NEW GAME TO JUMP INTO WITH A CHALLENGE AND GREAT SHOOTING I MEAN THE BEST SHOOTING GAME AROUND THIS IS YHE GAME   ****** EXCELLENT	1
This game can almost be described as a Max Payne clone.  It does some things better than Max Payne, and some things worse.  The slow motions stuff was WAY better in Max Payne, as was the overall atmosphere.  DTR adds some great stuff though, disarms are really fun to do. Some parts of the game feel overwhelming and almost too difficult, this detracts from the fun factor.  The graphics are good, better than MP, but not quite what an XBox game should look like. Maybe you'll like this, I did.  If you like Max Payne, or any 3rd person shooters, rent this guy.	1
This is a not as good version of Max Payne with some ninja twists thrown in.  It's story line is ok, based on a good cop who gets a "raw deal", kind of like in Max Payne, but the game play is inferior to Max Payne. 1. The shooting action is not too bad, though could be a little more interactive and realistic, and some of the music did not fit the scenes.  (A hip hop song during an intense shoot out, for example) 2. A personal bias, but I hate the ninja, kung fu sequences.  Like in much of the game, you play from a third person's perspective, where you really don't feal like the guy you are playing.  Some of the sequences are hard to do because of awkward angles.  And though I thought it was kind of funny, one goofy scene was after an intense ninja fight where you have to take out 18 bad guys at once in a prison block, you end the difficult sequence by fighting it out with a last prisoner in an arm wrestling match. 3. Some very difficult sequences where you are tested on how fast and accurately you can push your x-box control buttons, doing things such as lifting weights.  It was not only very challenging, but possibly impossible for some people to enjoy this game or continue it unless they are very good with their hand-eye coordination and have no hand or wrist ailments. 4. I thought the attack dog idea was a good one.  Very inventive. Over all a good game, though I am glad I rented it first.  I would not pay 50 dollars for it.  Save your money for Max Payne or Halo.	1
This game wouldn't be the same if it had been done any other way. As a golf game, it is challenging and fun, with a number of interesting holes and challenges (the mini-games which help you improve the skills of your golfer). As an adult, this game also provides a second component of fun humor and the ability to beat the snot out of your caddie to improve your character's mood. Perhaps the only downside of the game is the few animations and catch phrases for each player. (Of course you'll notice this too, since you'll be playing this game a lot!) But, to it's credit, the announcer has quite a few catchy sayings, some of which might follow you out on the course, if you're a real golfer -they're that much fun to say. If you really want your games to make a statement, this golf game says "Hey, I'm fun and I'm an excellent golf game too!" So try it. You'll be glad you did.	1
This game is incredible.  I bought it first for the novelty, I keep playing it because of the entertainment value. This game combines the game play of Golden Tee with the graphics of the best console games you've ever played all wrapped up in an adult-humor package. I recommend it to anyone 18 and over.	1
Outlaw Golf is fun and funny. Excellent Character and Environment design. Bad:Extremely difficult to hit a straight drive using the toggle buttons.	1
This is a horrible game.  It has rather amusing characters but that's about it.  Controlling the game is terrible especially the putting, which is almost impossible.  Being able to fight with your caddy is amusing as well, but this game is not worth owning.	-1
Outlaw Golf provides the perfect mix of golf and hilarity.  As many others have pointed out, the controls are excellent.  The characters are awesome.....everything from a wannabe rapper to a stripper to a dominatrix!  Especially interesting is the composure aspect of the game.  The better you play, the easier it gets.  The worse you play, the harder it gets.  But not to worry....they provide the perfect way out of that vicious cycle, and this is one of the best things about the game and which sets it apart from other golf games.....beating the snot out of your caddy!!!  And the better job you do of cracking your caddy's skull, the better you'll play.  Pure genius!  I hope they come out with an Outlaw Golf 2!	1
The actual golf in this game is entertaining, and it's challenging enough, after the first course. The characters and dialogue are amusing, and the play-by play still makes me laugh out loud now and again. The graphics are great (as usual for the Xbox), and the sounds are good, too, with a few exceptions. There are 4 practice-type mini-games, each with 3 or 4 levels of difficulty, and winning them allows you to improve your golfer.  Certainly a very cool feature. There are also many multiplayer options, including the very cool "My one and only" game, in which each player gets to pick one club to play the entire course with (plus a putter). My only complaints about this game are as follows: 1) No statistical tracking or records.  Many of you may know the arcade game "Golden Tee", which tracks stats such as Longest Drive, Longest Putt, Most Birdies, Most Eagles, Most Greens Hit, et cetera.  This is a feature that is sorely lacking in this game.  I'm not greedy, I don't need career stats for every player and such, but course records would add a lot of enjoyment for both the single and multiplayer modes. 2)  Only 3 courses.  In this day and age?  Surely they could have fit a minimum of 5 courses...even if they sprinkled in a few 9-hole courses on top of the 3 they have, it would expand the usuable lifespan of this game dramatically. Overall, I definitely recommend this game to golf lovers.  Don't be put off by the rowdy name -- it's all window dressing around a very solid golf sim.	1
if your like me seeing the title of this game makes you leary about buying it.  It doesnt sound like a good true to golf game. but let me tell you I could not have been more wrong I recieved the game as a gift so I didn't have to make the decision and I am glad someone else did it for me.  The game is very real to golf and humorous at the same time.  Why get a cookie cutter golf game like Tiger Woods or others when you can do a lot more than just play golf?  With lots of games and multiplayer modes this is a winning game	1
Outlaw golf is one of the best golf titles I have played on any system.  A quick list of the pros and cons. Pros: - You can unlock different characters and build up their attributes and club/ball selection. This is a good feature that I haven't seen on any other golf games. - Your players composure affects how forgiving the games controls are, if you shank one then your composure drops, a good shot will bring your composure slightly back up. - Did I mention the golf engine is incredible?  Well, it is.  Graphically, this game is top notch and the Xbox has the hardware to support it with only the occasional, baaaaaarely noticeable drop in frame rate. Cons: -  The jokes just aren't as funny as they try to be, and it gets a little old after a while -  The composure settings aren't all that accurate.  Example, any time you end up in the rough, your composure drops.  Well, most golfers I know aren't going to be too bummed if they are in the rough 12 yds from the hole after their 2nd shot on a par 5.  This can be pretty annoying sometimes. -  There needs to be more than 3 courses. -  My biggest gripe by far, the game is too easy.  While I struggle to break par on games like Links and Tiger Woods golf, I can consistently shoot 10-15 under par on this game.  Golf is supposed to be a CHALLENGE!  Sorry, anyway, is a good game.  I would recommend it despite its flaws.	1
It is really hard to describe a game like Outlaw Golf. At times it can be funny and great, yet then again in other situations it can be dumb and boring. In my opinion, Outlaw Golf isn't a good solid game.  My advice is that you shouldn't waste [price] of your money to get a game like this. PROS + Funny Jokes, Characters, Features -Some of the jokes in this game are great. Beating up your caddie when your [upset] (when your composure is low), is a terrfic feature which def. added to the positive side of this game. + Easy Controls -The first time you play it, I can almost bet that you will have the controls down in a matter of minutes. + Multiplayer -The multiplayer for this game is good. What I truly like about it is that you don't have to have 4 controllers to play against 4 people. All you need is one controller which allows  all the players to use. Also, another good aspect about multiplayer is that it offers different types of golf modes to play. CONS - Funny Jokes, Characters, Features -Although I said these catergories were good in the game, there also bad. Alot of the jokes get old very fast after you have played it a couple of times. This, I think, will leave gamers bored and even to the point where the don't want to play it anymore. - Only Three Courses -This has to be the most biggest thing wrong about the game, THERE ARE ONLY THREE COURSES TO PLAY! I mean come on, three courses for a [price] game, thats really pretty bad. After continuously playing each course... over and over again, it gets so stupid, boring, and pointless.  Although in the end, it may look like the PROs in this game out-do the CONs, that is def. not true. My advice is to save your money and wait for some better games to come out on XBOX. Believe me... you'll be glad you did.	-1
Golfing games have won their place in the sports genre of the gaming world. However, few gamers would agree that a typical golf game could steal their attention away from an action, adventure or First-person shooter. Until a few years ago, the closest that came to the gaming world as an appealing golf game was Mario Golf for the N64. But, this was during the systems descension from the console wars. This sets the stage for Outlaw Golf, one of the opening salvos for the Xbox in their extreme sports genre. Outlaw Golf is a solid golf game in which you play through 9 or 18 hole games choosing characters you wouldn't normally have on a golf course. The controls of the game were excellent allowing very good use of the Xbox controller and the control scheme is simple enough where almost anyone could pick it up and be decent enough within a few minutes. The sound was good as were the noises and comments the characters made which were rather amusing at times. But, this game could get rather old after awhile if you don't take to it immediately and therefore, the replay value suffers a bit. But, I enjoyed the game and can recommend it to any gamer. So rent it and if you feel so inclined, pick it up and play a few rounds of golf every once in awhile.	1
Forget the side shows here, this game is incredible.  I am more addicted to this then any game so far, and I own 15 games. It is so realistic, my handicap for this is the same as I have for real golf.  The simulation to real golf is simply amazing.  I am not that much into the commentary, so I through on a music cd and turn down the volume, and just play great sim golf. You must get this, if you ever liked Tiger, this is far better.	1
Before I give you my opinion on Outlaw Golf, I want to tell you about this game's offensive content, because there's a lot of it. This game contains strong language, coarse sexual dialogue and content, and bloodless, but still brutal, violence. It's single-handedly takes video game content to the next level. The next level is showing how games can be as, or almost as bad as, R rated films. This game may have a Teen rating (ages 13 and up), but don't be fooled. There are so many reasons why this game should have gotten a Mature (ages 17 and up) rating. The ESRB certainly didn't do their job when they rated this game. Despite being extremely lowbrow, though, Outlaw Golf is the best golf game I've played since Mario Golf (N64). The graphics shine brightly with well-detailed characters and courses, and the game moves at a good framerate. On the sound front, this game sizzles with authentic golf sounds, fitting music and hilarious voicework. The controls score high points with a nice analog swinging function and useful camera angles. Putting is presented in an innovative way here: you first aim your shot, and then press X and see a line of where the ball will go when you hit it with the specified amount of power. You want to aim so the line goes into the cup, but there's a catch: you can only see the path the ball will go three times for each putt, making you have to aim properly. Much like Mario Golf, this game is made for non golfers in mind, but is also fun for golf fans. The humor may be lowbrow, but it adds a new touch to games like this, and the nifty composure system works well. For example, if you make a good shot, your composure will go up, and you will do better playing, but if you make a bad shot, your composure will decrease and you'll do worse playing. To refill your meter, you must make good shots or use beating tokens. What are beating tokens, you ask? You earn these by making Birdies or multiple Pars. You can use these to beat up your caddie in a brutal fashion. Think fights on The Jerry Springer Show, and you've got the right idea (complete with the audience chanting "Fight!"). If you beat your caddie up well enough, you will fill up your composure meter. You have to press the A button at the right time to execute the beating, making skill involved. These fights are violent, but really funny and enjoyable. All in all, Outlaw Golf is a great golf game, and a great first showing (for me, at least) for developer Hypnotix. Even if you don't like golf, buy this game, as long as you're of the age (I'd recommend ages 17 and up or mature 16 year olds). FYI: Many people have complained that the game crashes with first generation Xbox systems, or the game just crashes, but I had no problems with the game. And for all you parents out there, don't let your kids anywhere near this game. Let them get Mario Golf instead.	1
Words cannot describe how enjoyable this game is but...I'll give it a shot. Usually I'm a walking, talking advertisement for Blockbuster. A majority of games out there are all hype and lack any sort of long-term playability (new word...don't try to look it up), thus require rental prior to ownership. Vivendi Universal has created a game that needs no trial period. Save your rental money for Hunter the Reckoning and just buy Outlaw Golf. First of all, throughout my gaming history I've had a tendency to toss instruction booklets (turns out you have to equip the abilities to use them in Final Fantay IX) and skip past any sort of intro scences. With Outlaw Golf my "instruction booklet tossing" streak remains intact but I have yet to skip past anything in the game. I would strongly suggest that you don't either. The tutorials, the intros, the hole flybys are all hilarious. Each character gives you a rundown on the holes and the tutorials are definitely helpful. The graphics and gameplay are both outstanding. And, much like golf in reality, the game can become extremely frustrating...but not in the sense that the game is going to be punted from a very tall building...more in the sense that you're going to work harder and get better. A couple of quick tips: 1. If you have a shot that requires you to hit at something like 22%, it is easier to let the meter run all the way up and then time your swing as it's coming back down then to try to get it right at 22% on the way up and then swing. 2. Listen to the flyby commentary...it's hilarious (did I already mention that?) 3. Go to the driving range to improve your skills (it's the last golf ball icon on the tournament select screen). That's problaby mentioned in the instruction booklet so it took me a week or so of playing to figure it out. 4. Beat the hell out of your caddy to start any tournaments. Not only is it pretty funny, it improves your gameplay immediately. One final note: I've always been a fan of golf games...Hot Shots Golf, Tiger Woods Somethingorother, PGA Tour on the PC. So this game is a "must buy" if you fall into that category. If not, go rent it, see what you think, and then buy it.	1
If there is anyone looking for a golf sim that does not take itself too seriously, then this is the game for you. As the first golf game of any kind for XBOX, the gang at Hypnotix have set the bar oh so high. Once you get past the novelty of the characters- with their sycophantic caddies in tow- and the low brow humor that runs throughout, you will find yourself playing quite a nice little golf sim. The ambitious and well-done Composure Response System (CRS) takes the simulation part farther than any of the true golf sims. While I am only vaguely familiar with the "Hot Shots" franchise on the PS2, I can confidently say it doesn't touch this. Here is a breakdown of the main components (1 Awful to 10 Great)... Gameplay (8.5): The game play is almost perfect. It uses the standard "stick" mechanism of today's sim swings. Pull down on the right analog stick and push up, but you had better do it straight. The wind, club selection, and your player's composure are also factored in nicely- and realistically. Finally, what better way to restore your composure after several bad shots than to beat the living daylights out of your caddy? You have to earn it though. You must acquire Beating Tokens to do so, and you can get these by doing good things such as shooting a birdie. Graphics (9.5): This team really tried to tap into the incredible power of the XBOX. Vertex shading and other tools are used to render a spectacular looking environment on all 3 courses. Top-notch. Replay (9.0): There is so much to unlock that you could easily not be finished before the sequel comes out. There are so many different types of games to win in Tourney mode, and when you do, you unlock goodies such as new equipment, new games, and (finally) new characters. The multiplayer mode is also excellent with even more diversity in gameplay modes, including Casino, Time Attack, and My One and Only added to the standard fare of Stroke, Match, and Skins. The only thing lacking here is multiplayer Tourney. And don't forget the training course. Here you can complete tasks to upgrade the golfer's skills. This game is the perfect sim/arcade hybrid. I had been waiting patiently for EA to release the Tiger Woods franchise on XBOX, but I wait no more. I have my golf game and it is a good one because it takes the positives from EA's Tiger and blends in some well thought-out fun. Sure, it does have a somewhat steep learning curve (I won't reveal too much here), but it is well worth it once you pick up on the nuances. The only real complaint I have is that it does not track user stats such as Driving Accuracy, Greens in Regulation, etc.  A small blemish indeed. For anyone who doesn't take their golf sims too seriously, this game is definitely for you.	1
This game is great and fun. Don't listen to Gamespots review of 7.1....I agree on the control scheme being a little (make that alot) frustrating at times but it makes the game more challenging....The announcers are annoying but funny and beating your caddie is always fun! I recommend this game to anyone!	1
Plain and simple, Outlaw Gold is a lot of fun.  For a game that features strippers, malpractice-suit laided doctors, dominatrix, bikers, etc. instead of Arnold Palmer or Tiger Woods, it actually a rather good golf game in it's own right. How good?  I think that the game play could sell the game if real golfers were used. The game is rather realistic; both in terms of game physics and players psyche.  What I mean by the latter is that if you score a 10 on a par three, getting under par on the next hole is a lot harder than if you''d made par on that par three.  In essence, the ease of play is granted to those who are playing well.  One of the great things about this game is that you can beat up you caddy to get back that karma. I only gave this game 4 out of 5 stars because at times the graphics look like a PS2 game; which isn't bad if you were playing this game ON a PS2, but I have come to expect a bit more from Xbox games.	1
Great product!	1
I played this on PS2 and I really enjoyed it, if you are a Dino nerd or Jurassic Park nerd this is the game to get. It has a great selection of Dinos that you can let roam free or enclose for entertainment. Also has missions to provide a little challenge for the outgoing. Nothing is better than building a Jurassic Park of your own. Now you can say "Welcome to Jurassic Park"	1
Very fun Sim game, probably not for hardcore Sim players, but good for many hours of relaxing fun...even when you let the dinosaus eat the tourists.  I think it has a huge amount of replayability, no park is probably gonna be the same.	1
This game pretty much came out after the Jurassic Park boom had passed.  Added to the fact that there were previous Jurassic Park games that were not as good probably caused many people to overlook this game.  Had this game come out at the peak of the movies and before other Jurassic Park games it would have been a huge hit.  Easily the best Jurassic Park game that nobody played.  Actually many never even heard of the game because it came out late in the Jurassic Park boom and subsequently not a lot of money was spent on publicity.	1
Operation Genesis is a great park building that rivals Zoo Tycoon. The game play is practaclly the same, but you are on a tropical island and have to create, feed, and display dinos. You also have to make sure your tourists are entertained. You can build burger stands, restrooms, and gift shops. Security is also a major importance. You can build ranger stations and machine gun turrents. (Please don't kill visitors) One of the downsides in the game is the weather. Sometimes thunderstorms and heatwaves hit your park, making visitors unhappy. And sometimes, you park is mauled by tornados. This destroys buildings, kills dinosaurs and visitors, and just is terrible to the player. :-( So, expect for a few bugs, Operation Genesis is a game that every dino nerd should have.	1
I've played Jurassic Park Operation Genesis where you have to build a 5-star dinosaur park & grow dinosaurs.  The PS version only allows you to unlock 3 sites to dig but the PC version allows 4 or 5.  I like creating but the game can be annoying with all the emails coming through every 5 seconds to report a problem.  I tried turning down the sound so I couldn't hear the urgent messages but if you turn down the sound, something bad could be happening in your park (like a T-Rex becomng enraged & breaking the fence to have your visitors for a mid-morning snack).  You need to send your rangers over (or you can fly the copter yourself) to sedate the dinosaur.  What a theme park - all your canivores are drugged up most of the time.  I don't like fences.  Put up Avoidance Beams which emits an electrical sound that repels dinosaurs but found out these beams run on batteries that have to charge so when they are off & charging, that's when the dinosaurs get through.  Twice I was fired for poor management.  Ingen doesn't like it when you run the park into the ground (lost track of how much money I was spending) and they don't like it when your visitors are being killed by Tornadoes (supposed to build Visitor Shelters to protect your visitors) or dinosaurs eating them (supposed to build fences to protect the visitors-but a high security fence makes it hard to view the dinosaurs).  Hey you can't please everybody.  Fun game and great learning tool also.  Teaches about the different dinosaurs of each period which could spark a child's curiousity to find out further information about dinosaurs.  No bones about it - Jurassic Park Operation Genesis is a great game.	1
Although I typically only play games such as Warcraft III, Splinter Cell, Freedom Force, and Neverwinter Nights, I was nicely surprised at the overall quality of this title. While it only takes a few hours to achieve the five-star park rating to 'win' (although you can choose to continue), it's a whole lotta fun getting there.  Primarily due to an almost incessant amount of in-game 'emails' (although the idea works nicely), you'll constantly be checking on your genetics lab, your fossil dig sites, your park research, your beloved dinosaurs, park management, and deciding what to build/create next that you'll rarely have time to actually enjoy the park you're creating!  The game includes excellent training exercises (plus it practically holds your hand the entire game, anyway) and a few superfluous yet well-done missions - added, I'm sure, to make this game seem longer. Although it has a few quirks (as most games do), its inspired gameplay and notable graphics make this a short, sweet, and fairly polished title that deserves more recognition from the mainstream game press than it's getting.	1
I Love JPark and I Love this Game Everyone who likes JPark this is a must Have!!!	1
I have the Demo and it allows you to play a few games... That's the only drawback with the demo. I had a riot playing it! I'll have to buy it when I can afford it. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Jurassic Park movies. I didn't care for the construction part of the game, where you build the nurseries and so on... Boring... But shooting the dinosaurs was pretty cool. I'd recommend it.	1
Operation Genesis is an economic sim where you create your own dinosaur park, but a few real-time elements breathe some new life into the genre.  Think of it as a game of Theme Park, where the main attractions can kill you. You start off the game on your own custom island, researching DNA, building exhibits, and of course constructing huge fences to keep the dinosaurs contained.  As your research progresses, you are able to create bigger and badder dinosaurs that generate additional customer interest.  Of course this raises the danger level as well.  To provide research material, you hire teams of archaeologists to dig up bones and amber.  As more material is collected and researched, the DNA of each dinosaur becomes more complete and the dinosaurs live longer as a result. I think the developers struck a nice balance of keeping the money management focused mainly on dinosaur research and less on the park itself so it doesn't turn into yet another economic sim.  You do have to monitor some areas like food and park cleanliness, but that's about it.  The majority of money is spent developing dinosaurs and their needs.  For instance, the dinosaurs need to be vaccinated to prevent a number of diseases that can afflict the animals.  Once the vaccines are developed, you need to build a helicopter station so they can be shot with the vaccine (or shot period if they go nuts and start attacking everything.)  You can't spend the entire time focused only on the dinosaurs, though.  You also need to spend time researching new and better exhibits, such as balloon rides, viewing towers, and the ever-popular jungle safari tours in the woefully inadequate Nissan pickups, so the customers can see the dinosaurs better and improve your park rating. As the research improves and new technologies are developed, you get an email telling you everything, and I mean everything that happens.  This starts to get a little annoying after a while as many of the "common sense" decisions could be delegated.  It would have been nice to be able to adjust the settings so certain decisions, like reviving a sick dinosaur or selling fully researched DNA material, could be made automatically.  Every so often, a little real-time gameplay comes into action.  For instance, a dinosaur might trash one of the pickups, leaving the survivors stranded and it's up to you to fly a helicopter overhead and rescue them before they get trampled on or eaten.  Or, if you like, you can jump on one of the balloons or pickups to take some pictures of the dinosaurs.  If your photography skills are good enough, they might get published and you'll make a little extra cash as a result. One of the best features of the game is simply watching the behavior of the dinosaurs as they interact with one another.  Certain dinosaurs tend to get along, others don't.  As you introduce new and different dinosaurs, the dynamics of the park change.  When my park started off with all herbivores, they would wander all over the place.  Once I introduced some carnivores, especially my bad-boy T-Rex, they tended to become much more territorial.  Plus my normally docile triceritops would start freaking out and trash any nearby pickups, much to the chagrin of the customers.  Other dinosaurs would get so stressed, they'd simply keel over and die.  Some of the behaviors are a little buggy, they like pushing each other around while they're sleeping, for instance.  But for the most part they do seem to have individual personality and it adds a lot to the game. There are some minor gripes, such as being forced to used certain functions with a keyboard even though the entire game could have been mouse driven.  My main gripe, though, is that it's a little too easy.  I'm no expert in these types of games, but even in my first game, I easily created a money making machine with every exhibit and every dinosaur researched in spite of numerous mistakes that I wouldn't make my second time around.  There's really not much involved in keeping the park maintained or the customers happy.  It didn't seem like it made much difference to the customers whether I had a few or a lot of dinosaurs.  In fact, it seems like the less dinosaurs you have, the easier it is to play.  Having said that, I was feeling pretty smug about my park when a huge twister ripped through destroying everything in its path.  I was having so much fun watching the devastation that I forgot to declare a state of emergency.  Let's just say that the few customers that lived probably won't return anytime soon. So should you buy it?  If you're looking for a complex economic sim, you'll probably be happier with Sim City 4.  It's also graphics-intensive, so it'll struggle on standard video cards, but anyone with a Geforce or Radeon will be able to play it.  Aside from that, you really do get the "virtual" thrill of building and managing your very own dinosaur park.  Hope the review helped.	1
this is an AWESOME GAME!, i can't begin to explain how wonderful this game is. i had the namco version of tennis called SmashCourt Pro Tennis, it was a solid game, but to compare the two is something different. Sega is in a class all by themselves. they have the greatest sports games!, Well EAgames is pretty darn close. i was in EB about two days ago and this little kid was playing the game off the demo machine and i did a double take, i said darn that game is tight! so i watched the kid play and i said this game has awesome sound, graphics(for PS2),camera angles, and facial detail of the players. most of all this game had the Williams sisters in it, which SCPT didn't have, plus they only had one camera angle. so after work i went home to get SmashCourt and trade it in for Sega's action. i'll never regret it. sorry Namco, it is time to hang up SmashCourt because Sega Sports Tennis has no competition! so go out today and BUY, not rent, or borrow from a friend, but BUY SST, ya won't regret it one bit!	1
Sega turned another one of its great Dreamcast sports games into an even better PS2 game. This game is pretty much the same as the Dreamacst version, but still a whole lot of fun. This game has not only 8 men but also has 8 women players. The players include Patrick Rafter, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Tommy Haas, Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles. The gameplay is amazing. There are 3 buttons you use. One is for a lob shot, one is for a smash shot and the other is just a regular old shot. You really only need to use two buttons (the joystick and the A button). The graphics are way better than 2000's Virtua Tennis (for the Dreamcast) and are even better than most of the other 2K2 games. Each player resembles it's real-life counterpart very well and any tennis fan can pick them out. The graphics are so realistic that their clothes and shoes look exactly like what they do in real-life. The courts are also very realistic and their are more than a dozen more different courts. There are 3 modes: World Tour, Exhibition and Tournament. In World Tour you pick a player and participate in a variety of singles and doubles matches as well as many fun bonus games like in Virtua Tennis. You earn money when you win or do good in the bonuses to use to buy more equipment or courts. In Exhibition you just pick two players and serve away in just one match. In tournament mode you pick one player and face off against the rest of the men or women and player in a series of games until you either win the championship or lose. Some more cool things are that you can actually understand the PA announcer and when you hit a ball into the net the ball boys run out and retrieve the balls. Also when you hit a ball out of the court near the wall the people standing there will avoid the balls by moving out of the way instead of standing like statues. Also the players are every detailed. Monica Seles grunts when she hits the ball and after you win your player has a big smile and after you lose they look very mad and disappointed and are ready to throw their rackets. The only things missing are some of the players like Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Martina Hingis and Jennifer Capriti. This game is a must-have for any owner of a PS2 who is a tennis fan. Gameplay: 5/5 Graphics 5/5 Controls: 4/5 Overall: 5/5	1
Gameplay: 5/5 Graphics 4/5 Controls: 4/5 Sound: 3/5 Overall: 4/5 It sums up to be pretty good but it does have some flaws.	1
The much anticipated World Series BB2K3 is a phenomenal effort from Sega, and does not disappoint.  The game delivers on all levels: >> Superb graphics:  This game is rich in texture and the graphics are deep.  There are hundreds of never seen before action sequences, highlights, play-making shots, slow-mo, instant replay, batting stances, authentic pitching motions, etc., you name it, Sega's done it. >>  Realistic playability:  On the "All-Star" mode, the game provides a solid challenge.  There'll be close games, occasional blow-outs, hot streaks, cold streaks, etc., just like a season should be. >>  Miscellaneous:  Other options include -- Extensive franchise mode to test your managerial aptitude; Legend Mode where you can play with the likes of Cobb, Mays and DiMaggio; Create-a-Player mode (where you can choose gloves, shoes, sleeves, bat color, stance, power, speed, etc.);  Season, Playoff, Quick Start modes;  Home Run Derby ---- basically, there's enough exciting options for hours and hours of competitive fun. A must have for the baseball season ahead.  A leap beyond WSBB2K and 2K1, and an eternity from half-inspired games such as All Star BB and Triple Play. Now get to it.	1
I should preface my remarks by saying that I haven't played any of the other modern baseball video games and so can offer little in the form of comparison.  However, standing on its own merits, WSB is an excellent game.  The franchise mode is everything it has been hyped up to be and it sets the standards for sports franchise gaming on the Xbox.  Gameplay itself is slick and accurate, with a huge range of options to create an ideal gaming environment.  You can make the game incredibly easy or incredibly difficult, making this the perfect "father-son" game.  Dad can play with a slower pitch speed and really enjoy all the nuts and bolts of the franchise mode while the kid, with the reflexes of a eleven year old, can play with blink of the eye pitching speeds.  The baseball is balanced and realisitc, with scores and the sort of plays you would see in a real, major league game.  Pitching and hitting are both a ton of fun and the pitches really act the way they should.  Curve balls curve, change ups look like fastballs until they suddenly droop out slowly at the end, sliders will flare out and then break sharply over the plate, and so on.  If you have a good eye, you can spot pitches as they come out and hit accordingly, but better pitchers have better stuff that is harder to read just like better batters have larger hitting cursors and can drive the ball farther. My criticisms of the game are minor, but enough to keep it from earning five stars.  The baseball AI is occasionally questionable.  Baserunners will make some of the most idiotic mistakes sometimes, manufacturing double plays that never should have happened.  Also, against the computer, stealing a base is nigh to impossible, even with speedsters like Ichiro, and walks are not nearly as big a part of this game as they are in real life.  Finally, it can be hard on the eyes to read over your stats sometimes as the folks at SEGA have decided to put colored stats up against similarly colored backdrops, causing them to meld together on poorer quality TVs.  Straight black numbers against a white background would have been much easier to read. However, please don't view the above list as a serious set of detractions.  The game as a whole is enormously fun and dangerously addictive with tremendous replay value.  The franchise mode is truly something special and if you like baseball, you'll love this game.	1
To begin, i'm gunna start with graphics.  The Graphics are steller, but the stadiums sometimes lack a little. But Not alot.  The Animations are dead on.  The players are the best lookin players yet.  The only thing i don't like is when you hit a homerun and you whatch the ball go into the stands or acroos the fence, the ball seems to just disapear.  Now with xbox's power, they coulda helped that.  but besides that the game looks good.   The sound is great,  commentary is dead on, in game sounds are dead on and sound lifelike.  No problems here.  The gameplay is one of the best things in this game.  It acts like the real game.  Wheather your hitting the ball or playing in the outfield, its great, and always challanging.   The last thing i'm going to talk about is the setup, WSB offers alot of types of games to play, whether its season or franchise or th home run derby.  There all great, the best is the franchise.    So much to do hear and its all so real, but the problem here is the fact that each year the schedule never changes(NEVER)and even though thats not a big problem, it can get annoying.  But the rest of the franchise is the best of the best.    The home run derby, may be my least fave thing to do on hear.  It seems to easy and not realistic.  Home runs will always range from 480ft-505ft and never below that.  And hittign a homer is easer, the only way not to hit a homer is if it went foul.   The Exhibition is great and the season is great.  The statistics and as in deph as you can get.  There great for the people who love to keep track of stats and people who want to start, and even for those who don't like keeping track.   So in conclusion i gave this game 4*'s because of the minor problems, so overall this game is the best baseball game out there today...	1
This game brings home the best a baseball game can have.  From the realistic graphics to physics that are more real then I ever expected. I love NFL Fever, and never expected to be drawn into a baseball game like I am to NFL Fever.  I was shocked, especially from the standpoint that typically sport sims, err on side of offense, and scores are usually pretty unrealistic. This game has a balance that bring baseball to your home.  Of course, one more cheer for the graphics.  Love that Sega! I guess I have to go with NHL 2K3 this year instead of NHL 2003 by EA	1
Sega has all of sudden freed it's creative prowess by the release of it's finest chapter of WS BB, and honestly, next to High Heat, which wasn't even on Xbox, Xbox fans were given a royal kick in the rear with the low quality releases of TP and ASB. This game is very realistic, and while it may come a little easy to hit homers, this game is recognized for the ultra realistic movements of the players that match their real life counterparts from swings to clutch throws and hits to the flawless lifelike player models to where you can tell who the player is. Xbox Baseball fans would be punishing theirselves if they didn't buy this right away, and if you have common sense, you'll buy it too.	1
I have try every baseball game on every system there is.  Believe me this is the very best!!!.  Now I am happy that I brought the XBOX.  The graphics is excellent the game play is awesome. I don't think they could get any better.  But don't tell them that. EA Sports should retire. SEGA you are the best. WORLD SERIES IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOY GRAPHICS AND GAMEPLAY. Let me rate this game a 10.	1
Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers won't be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right.	1
The Good: Great graphics, amazing dialog, story, and style, and humor, great level design and stealth game play, cool weapons and gadgets, upgrading your abilities actually helps, Cate Archer is a major hottie  The Bad: Multiplayer is just ok, should have also been on the Xbox  NOLF2 is a very under appreciated game, and that's why no one knows about it. It was critically acclaimed and wasn't in sales. This is due to the fact that the main protagonist is a female. NOLF2 was the best FPS of it's time and is even better than some are today. The game has great humor, voice acting, dialog, and game play ideas. The story is about Cate Archer who is trying to stop the evil H.A.R.M organization from finishing Project: Omega. No one knows what it is but it has to be stopped. In the mean time Russia and the US are starting a new war. While the story is great with lot's of humor such as in India you're on the back of a tricycle with your gun while you stop a midget French mime on a unicycle...yeah you heard me!  The game is also serious at the same time and Monolith pulled this off perfectly. The stealth in the game is also just right in difficulty and isn't unforgiving like Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid. The game is like a 70s James Bond really and it pulls the feel off perfectly. The weapons in the game are pretty cool like a mascara stun gun, keychain flashlight, a mirror decoder, a hairspray welder etc. You also have a crossbow that can have different ammo types and even a utility launcher to disable cameras and short circuit Super Solider Robots.  The game never gets repetitive or old since you switch from stealth to fire fights often. While you can pick up intelligence in the game from drawers, letter lying around etc to gain points to upgrade your abilities. The online multiplayer is also fun but nothing too special. You HAVE to play NOLF2 because you're missing out on one of the best FPSs of all time.	1
along with the original, this is one of the best games ever designed awesome gameplay, graphics, and AI. highly recommended!!!!	1
If you've never played NOLF II, you should stop reading this review and buy yourself a copy. One of the funniest and fun games ever created, it redefined what a FPS could be by delving into spy movie cliches with a reckless abandon, but not at the expense of great gameplay.  I remember reading reviews of this game when it was first released saying it was the best FPS ever made at the time, and I've got to say, it has aged very, very well. While the graphics don't have the creamy polished look of new generation games, the controls, gameplay, humor, characters, and replay value set this one apart. Even the multiplayer cooperative missions were ahead of their time.  Spy genre games have always been tops on my list, and this game is tip-top of them. Kate Archer might be the best female characters in gaming history, (in close competition with April Ryan from THE LONGEST JOURNEY, Alex Vance of HALF LIFE, and Zelda).  It is utterly ridiculous that Sierra has not made another NOLF game. Kate deserves another go-around with all the technological glory of modern generation games.	1
There's nothing more fun than blowin' away the baddies.  Unless you're in a goofy, off-the-wall shooter like "No One Lives Forever 2"!  This is one of my all time favorites and most deseverdly so!  Why you ask?  That's a good question, so allow me to break it down for you:  PROS:  1.  Action:  Tons of bullet blasting mayhem on 40 levels!  The AI improves as you go farther into the game.  Them baddies can dodge I tells yah! 2.  Design:  Aside from the level designs the costumes and backgrounds are terrific.  There's a lot of talent involved in designing tunnels, bases, rooms and characters.  Great to look at! 3.  Artillery:  Great selection of machine guns and the various types of ammunition for those, handguns and shotguns.  Not to mention grenades and some really WEIRD objects that are too bizarre to explain... 4.  Humor:  Very, very funny stuff!  A terrific assortment of puns, British witt and Monty Python-esque silliness!  Great dialogue and plot! 5:  Saving:  There's automatic saves and then there's your own at any time and anywhere! 6.  Music:  Groovy and exciting tunes through out. 7.  Voice Acting:  Top notch acting with great directing. 8:  Online Gaming:  Crazy.  Fun.  Dig it! CONS: 1.  Switching of weapons:  It takes too long sometimes to be able to fire when switching between artillery.  Usually, it's when a weapon that needs to be cocked that this will be an issue. 2.  A-to-B-to-C gameplay:  Pick "A" up to open "B" with, etc.  It gets a bit repetitive but not so much that you'll get annoyed. 3.  Stealth:  It's a great concept but for some reason it's not logically implemented here.  When you hide in a shadow a "hide bar" pops up and it takes "time" to become unseen.  I'm not sure why the designer thought this was a good idea considering shadows don't take 5 seconds to fall upon someone.  Kinda dumb. 4.  Ranking.  I'm not sure what you have to do to rank well but I picked up just about everything I could and had a decent shooting ratio but my rank level never increased.  I didn't care really, but best not to even have this system included.  --  It's a terrific game that is clever, exciting and fun to play.  Highly recommend picking it up!  PS:  Make sure to download and install all the updates to 1.3.  There's an update feature installed along with the game so make sure to use it.  PSPS:  Amazon has XP listed as the only operating system;  this is incorrect.  W98, 2000 and ME are usuable operating system to play this.	1
No One Lives Forever 2 is a very fun game that largely carries on in the tradition of the first, but can't recapture its spirit. The first game, which was as close to a female Austin Powers flick as legally possible, sparkled with 60's era James Bond superspy culture. Largely unrealistic in its over the top plot and villainous characters, it still drew the player into its day-glo trippy world with fantastic physics, consistently stunning graphics and level design, and sympathetic protagonists brought to life with (mostly) sharp and humorous dialogue.  The sequel trades in the psychadelic backdrops for a more serious, relatively colorless atmosphere. While perhaps more realistic, it's nevertheless not as fun as the first. It never approaches the level of tedium, but there was nothing in NOLF 2 that really compelled me to continue exploring through the next level as in the first game. Except my completist ego of course.  Another mistake I believe was made in excluding the training sessions back at headquarters. These introduced the exotic and often silly superspy weapons, and also built depth into the original game's atmosphere. I missed those interludes in the sequel. I was also disappointed with 2's restrictive pre-mission weapon selection. NOLF's ability to choose inventory between levels gave me a greater feeling of control over my methods of conquest. Not to mention the sequel is a bit shorter, which just adds to the shallow feeling.  I also fear the developers tried to lean too hard on the "stealth" mechanic, which doesnt really work any better in the sequel than the original. Too many sequences in NOLF2 are frustrating trial-and-failure excercises, due to inconsistent enemy awareness. Perhaps the worst error was the inclusion of infinite enemy respawn points at certain areas of the game. It's simply a cheap, illogical, and frustrating tactic to extend difficulty without having to work too hard at gameplay balance.  In its own right, NOLF2 is a very good first person shooter. But comparisons to the first are inevitable, and in their attempt to differentiate the sequel from the original, the developers may have learned the hard way that the only direction away from the fantastic No One Lives Forever was down.	1
NOLF2 has some bugs still.  However it is tons of fun.  The Good:  It is well-written and the voice acting is stellar.  Graphics are great.  The Bad:  The game play is a bit repetitive at times.  Also, it does happen to freeze up occasionally.  I had to check with a walkthrough several times, only to find that I missed welding a small hinge or lock.  Also, I am not sure how much fun this would be to play again... replay value is important in a game.  Don't cheat with this game... there is one spot (on a level in India) that if you do cheat, you won't be able to finish the level.  I know because I learned this the hard way. (OK, I admit it... I like to cheat when playing off line).  So, I am giving this 4 stars due to replay value and bugs.  If you are willing to put up with these two issues, it is well worth the time and investment.  I would like to see another adventure with Cate in it.	1
Cate Archer returns in a game that's bigger, more advanced, and yet somehow less fulfilling.  The original NOLF was so funny because it ran in it's own universe, the sequel is very much aware of it's sixties references and pokes fun at itself at the gamer's expense.  Lots of memoes/conversations pointing out the impractiality of how a secret criminal organization would work, a bad guy who returns in the form of his empty house, and so on.  My worst peeve was the spawning bad guys, which wasn't good if you're stuck in the map and running low on ammo.  Some originality saves it, such as a ninja sword fight in the middle of a tornado, and the settings in Japan and India.  The mimes, however, were a missed opportunity.  Overall I still liked the game, and the improved game engine made  a somewhat more immersive environment, but it lacked the charm and originality of the original.	1
This game includes a graphic, which is perfect and also the controls are quite good. The maincharacter is that sexy Cate Archer. Her height is 5'8(1m 73). The multiplayer-mode is forgetable, because there's no deathmatch and one can't choose f. E.: Armstrong or Cate and that's really bad. Armstrong is also my favourite during the Singleplayer-mode. I love such shooting-games, like NOLF 2. Love for Cate Archer!!!	1
Cate Archer is back in this much anticipated sequel.  She's gotten a graphic face-lift and boy is she beautiful!  This time she's after more evil henchmen.  As in the last game you'll be able to drive select vehicles and the story is equally as compelling.  The graphics are great, Cate never looked better and the environments are way more detailed than the first installment.  However, you will find this game to be much shorter than the original.  That's no reason to avoid it though, as I'm sure you'll know from playing the first game, you just can't get enough of Cate and the wacky humor of No One Lives Forever.  Underneath the pretty exterior is a killer FPS with unique weapons and hot action.  Buy this game before it's out of print.  It's a classic.  And don't forget to get the first game as well.	1
the first one was more action based,rpg and here it becomes more of a shooter game.	1
This is a pretty good sequel to the first No One Lives Forever, though it lacks the cohesiveness of the first and just isn't as funny and original. Plus, some of the levels are overly long and the skill system is a little strange and annoying. Still, it's a great game [even if I can't get it to run on my latest system.]	1
This game is pure action. You will need to follow the "Intelligence" tips and shooting with accuracy. No puzzles, but if you love to be a spy, this is your game.  You can select three resolutions, according your video card. The game runs OK in a ATI Radeon 7500, and you can play a super spy, hard, normal or easy mode game.  About mature content, don't worry, it's only about blood and some realistics murders.	1
Nicely Done Litech! I thought for a brief moment, the $10 I was thinking on buying birth control with was wasted, but thanfully I was mistaken! After a slow start, the story gets interesting. This is one Game where even if you play it in cheat mode, it won't help you much. Which I got frustrated with at the beginning, but then, actually let me play the game for longer! From Graphics to Sound, this game has it all. Value for Price? - you CANNOT go wrong!  I hope the put out a Part 3 to this series! For those of you who spent $50 on Doom 3, hows your computer holding up stoopid!?	1
Whoever said sequels are bad, this one proves them wrong.  No One Lives Forever 2 is a brand new game in itself, not just a sequel. New game engine, new characters, missions and weapons.  It even contains rpg elements. Players obtain points by completing mission objectives and discovering secret documents. In turn, these points can be used to improve certain aspects of the game's character such as strength, weapon proficiency, etc.  Very cool game but multiplayer is a bit on the childish and boring side.	1
Humor, memorable characters, and unique weapons all make this game stand out from the crowd. Plus it still has great graphics and sound by today's standards. If you like FPS and want a little break from the usual dark games in the genre, then what are you doing reading this? BUY THE GAME!	1
After playing the first two missions of No One Lives Forever 2 (NOLF2), I thought I'd found what I previously thought did not exist: namely, a flawless game.  Everything seemed perfect, but alas, nothing is perfect in this world especially when it comes to computer games. Don't get me wrong; I find a lot to like in this game, not the least of which are the graphics.  My PC features a 128 MB Radeon 9800 Pro graphics card, so I was able to turn up the graphics options.  I believe NOLF2 may have the best looking rendering of people of any game I've played, and the AI is above average too.  There's a lot of detail in the visuals in this game, and almost everything looks clear which is a real plus considering that many of the newer games often look indistinct especially when they try to render tree leaves. Getting back to the first level or two--not only did the levels look good, but the gameplay, AI, and everything else worked really well.  You can even ride a snowmobile which I did even when it wasn't necessary.  These levels showed off the graphics of NOLF2 (see above), and I was impressed with a waterfall on the first level and explosions on the next level or two. But it didn't take much longer to see some flaws in this game.  Since it's a spy game, you naturally need to do a lot of snooping.  What I didn't like about the searching is that you need to point your cross hair all over the place to find text that tells you that you need to press the use key to do something like activate a switch.  It's very easy to miss these text prompts, and I spent a lot of time wandering a level or even going back and forth between levels only to realize that I'd missed a prompt when I was very near it a half-hour earlier!  Very frustrating. Another problem with the game is the stealth missions.  Most of the time NOLF2 is rather forgiving in that you can blast your way through trouble if you are spotted, but on at least one level you must either go back to the beginning of the level if you are seen or load your last save.  It must have taken me the better part of an hour and numerous reloads until I finally found the room I needed to search for without getting caught.  Nevertheless, the stealth missions in this game are better than what you find in most games, and you learn tricks to get through them.  Just be prepared to get frustrated until you learn the best stealth techniques. Although No One Lives Forever 2 is a good game, it's not the flawless game I thought it might be.  Those first two missions were a tease, I suppose.  So if anybody finds a perfect game, preferably a shooter, then please let me know! Pros: Great graphics Virtually perfect at the beginning Cons: Frustrating searches due to a text-prompt interface Less than perfect as one progresses through the game	1
What a wonderful time I had with this game. It was captivating while still being laugh out loud funny. Anyone who thinks they've seen it all will have to admit to being amazed and delighted by the scret of the Mime King. That one still gets me going...as does the ensuing chase. Sometimes all the reviews are true and in this case, they are.	1
I know there are a lot of NOLF fans out there but I didn't play NOLF 1, so I had no extreme expectations of this game. My computer is waaay beyond the recommended configuration, yet load times are about 20-30 seconds (which is unacceptable). I admit, graphics and sound are excellent but that's about it: the story is barely ok (with stupid story elements which are sometimes referred as "funny" - I think they sucked at best, some of them are downright offending (I'm not Russian but I know quite a few, I felt offended because of the idiotic jokes)). Missions are sooo boring, it's unbelievable (most missions are like "kill everyone, get key, open door"). Some levels are very tough and the randomly respawning enemies really pissed me off. One *VERY* frustrating thing was that this game is the only one to date (and to my knowledge) that crashes Windows XP so that you have to reboot it. Just this alone should mean the end of Sierra. If you're a hardcore NOLF fan, you might like this thing but I give 1 star out of 5, only for the nice graphics. I'll probably never buy a Sierra product again and certainly hope that they go out of business.	-1
Buy it ! You will not be disappointed.	1
Looks and plays better than the first NOLF.  The Jupiter engine is quite a step above the Lithtech engine. I have very few complaints about this one.  The sense of humor isn't quite what it was in the first NOLF (but as with the first NOLF, long as you weren't trigger happy, you'll be listening in on some very funny dialog between various bad guys).  It took a little getting used to the different voice actors (was it that hard to get the original voice actors to reprise their roles?).  Another technical flaw that I couldn't understand was the reloading sequences of the guns.  Reloading a totally empty gun doesn't require the pulling back of a cocking handle (this was correctly done in the first NOLF however).  Although you can improve Cate's reloading time (part of the skill based sytem, which is something I like in the game), the only way you can avoid pulling a cocking handle is when a round is already in the chamber!  If that's what the prgrammers intended, they made another mistake of undercounting the total number of bullets loaded in the gun by one (this is an unfortunately universal mistake in games).	1
No One Lives Forever 2 (NOLF2) is the sequel to the award-winning No One Lives Forever (how appropriate.) The original NOLF was named Game of the Year by many publications, and for good reason. The sequel brings back some of your old enemies, and is full of snappy British humor, good gameplay, and a fantastic story. NOLF2's graphics are amazing. Environments come to life with real-life physics. The Ohio level is amazing. A twister is barreling through a trailer park, and the grass blows in the wind, trailers flip over, and nothing feels scripted. The sound is just as good. There are excellent sound effects, and the voice acting is fantastic. The soundtrack can get a little old, but changes with each environment. The gameplay is very good. It combines espionage type gameplay (like Splinter Cell) and harcore action (like Soldier of Fortune). It's definitely a hybrid between those two genres. The storyline is fantastic. I don't want to give anything away, but take my word for it. Basically Cate Archer, the star of the game, is returning to defeat the H.A.R.M organization. There are a few extremely bizzare tech issues. My system is a top-of-the-line PC, and I experienced a few random crashes. There were a few odd missions, and the mossion designed seemed....off, but it wasn't enough to drop it to 4 stars. Overall, I recommend this game to any FPS fan, as well as any fan of a good PC game.	1
This is much better than NOLF, I have played this game and defeated it about 5 times, this is a very enjoyable game.  I highly recommend it.	1
First off the screenshots don't give this games graphics justice turn the stuff up to max and its absolutely beatiful.  Next is the gameplay.  While a few things were unnecisary (common skill points?? this is a fps not an rpg, althought i will admit it gives the game a slight flavor, but it isn't neccesary) the rest of the gameplay is great, great AI great weapon diversity.  excellent intergration of the player into the envirements, lots of secrets and a darn hilarous storyline. This is a great game, althought just a tad on the short side its well worth the price of admission. IF you like fps's this is a great addition to your collection.	1
I loved every second of this game. The graphics are unprecedented in 1st person type games. This game rocks and there's even a lead in to a 3rd game!! I can't wait!  I didn't know if a sequal could live up to the first game, but not only did it live up to it, it's bigger and better. It may seem short when you see that there are 15 missions, but there are at least 3-4 parts to each mission so actually it is nearly twice as long as the first game contrary to what one reviewer already said. I highly reccomend this game. It's well worth the full price.	1
This is my all time favorite game.  Very inventive settings and situations.  I loved being swept away in the house during the tornado and the bumbling fool enemies.  I had to upgrade my video card to play this game, but it was worth it.  I hope to see a third installment.	1
I liked the first NOLF so I bought this sequel. This game is a lot of fun to play, the graphics are very well rendered and the humorous storyline held my interest. I especially liked using the crossbow, impaling many a foe against a wall! I also loved the fact that you can ride vehicles in this game, its alot of fun "thumping" guards with a snowmobile. Some of the game levels are too difficult at times, "find this paper, get this switch"; prompting me to resort to cheat codes in order to move things along. Be warned: using certain cheats at certain times will lock you out of game's storyline; preventing you from picking up a necessary item that triggers a new plot sequence. I learned this the hard way, when I had to repeat an entire mission over because I couldn't pick up a briefcase full of supplies.  Other than that one problem I have had a good time playing NOLF2, my computer seems to like the game two since it runs just fine without any patches installed. Buy it.	1
If you had the opportunity to play the original No One Lives Forever, and you're thinking of purchasing the sequel, chances are you liked the original:  A fun, campy, action-packed spoof of 1960's spy movies (James Bond in particular) and television shows. NOLF2 delivers another dose of the same in this first person shooter.  The graphics are well-done with Lithtech's Jupiter engine.  The levels are varied (the tricycle chase and the house-in-a-tornado battle were both different and hilarious), the conversations between the bad guys are as much the silly fun they were in the original and the action is well-paced.  A new skills-based "lite" system adds interest to the game.  Cate Archer, the character you play, is able to be made into a sneaky, silent spy or a full-bore gun goddess.  Your choice! The Artificial Intelligence is some of the most interesting that I've seen.  The baddies don't just go off on timed pathfinding.  They are programmed to be object based.  In other words, they do something different all the time, based on objects in a room.  And when there are many different objects in the room (cigarettes, chairs, desks, coffee cups, etc.) it can trigger a different action each time you load the game--extending its replayability. So, with so much right, why only 4 stars?  On its own, it's a brilliant game.  However, compared to the original NOLF, it is missing something.  It's taken me a long time to pinpoint what that is, but I believe it lacks the same soul as its predecessor.  The cut scenes have been trimmed CONSIDERABLY, which has led to less character development than the original had.  The game is also shorter.  Plus, some of the stealth aspects were still less feasible because there is a place early in the game where the baddies respawn.  It tends to push you from loitering in one place for too long, but that is an irritating way to move the game along. Overall, I got the feeling that the developers did an excellent job listening to complaints about the original and addressing them.  However, I believe they overcorrected in their solutions.  Still, the game stands on its own.  I have no doubt a third installment will be coming.  My hope is that the end result will include the better storytelling aspects from the first, meshed with the improved design of the second.	1
No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way continues the story of British agent Cate Archer, and her quest to save mankind. She's like a female Austin Powers, set in the 60s but a bit more witty and intelligent. Cate Archer isn't Rambo. Her missions aren't about shooting everyone in sight. Instead, you lurk in the shadows, use your ultra-cool weapons like the Angry Kitty, and distract your enemies by throwing coins or hitting wind chimes. The levels are very well done. The graphics are great and quite realistic, making you really feel like you're in different areas of the world in the 60s. The computer characters chat with each other and the ambient noise fits in well. The music is great! There are all sorts of types of missions, with a wide selection of weapons to find and funny scenes to keep you entertained. The game really pulls you along and the ride is quite enjoyable. The characters are very well done and seem quite real. Add on to all of this a quite-fun on line game experience and you can easily play this for months. Highly recommended for any spy-game-fan!	1
Yet another groundbreaker when it comes to gameplay and graphics. The whole singleplayer experience is superb and enjoyable. My only wish was that the singleplayer module would have been as long as NOLF1's. NOLF2 comes in at about half the total length of the first one. However, the graphics are great and there is a new DeathMatch patch available. The deathmatch mode is arguably the funnest there is todate. 'nothin like the total online bliss of seeing your opponents walk straight into your beartrap, or get mauled by the AngryKitty ;)	1
Having never played the first installment, I can't vouch for NOLF2's faithfulness as a sequel. Apparently some fans of the first NOLF were a bit disappointed. Regardless, I am now officially hooked on Cate Archer. "A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way" beautifully captures all the feel, textures, and sounds of 60's spy flicks with an absolutely delightful sense of humor. Yes, this is basically another first-person shooter with an entrance and exit to each level, fairly linear missions, and several "bosses" to defeat, but enough was going on in between to keep me very interested. I found the levels and missions were also varied enough between stealth, shoot-em-up, investigation, riding on a snowmobile, and downgright silliness, to keep things from getting dull. The graphics are gorgeous and show excellent use of the lithtec jupiter engine. All the locales from snowy Siberia to the caves of HARM's secret underground headquarters (complete with artificial lava) are very well done. I especially enjoyed the retro 60's look in HARM's undersea lab and UNITY's headquarters. The sounds and music are also outstanding. One level has Cate doing some investigating in a trailer park in Ohio - with a full blown tornado in the background. While inside, the sounds of the wind battering and rattling the house are quite unnerving. Once outside, total chaos reigns with sounds of debris striking off of and embedding itself in various surfaces while the wind roars in the background and trailers roll over. The music is top-notch and perfectly matches each locale and the 60's theme. The music also changes appropriately depending on the action. As far as weapons go, you always start each mission with just a small array, but every level has plenty of weapons to find with a little looking. As is the case with the game in general, weapons range from the typical shoot-em-up ak47's and tommy guns, to spy gadgets like tranquilizer darts and stun guns, to the plain absurd like laughing gas grenades, explosive mechanical kitties, and my favorite hands-down - the banana! It's really the characters, though, that made the game for me. The voice acting is movie quality and all of the NPC's are done very well. And, unlike the Austin Powers series, there is no shameless mugging or gross humor here, which implies that the creators of this game know what real humor is - namely grabbibg a tommy-gun and hopping on the back of a kiddie tricycle being peddaled by your burly Scottish sidekick (kilt and all) in pursuit of a 3 foot mime/arch-criminal on a unicycle through the back streets of an Indian city. System specs: P4 1.9ghz, 512mb rambus, TI4600 Geforce4 128mb, Soundblaster live X-gamer. Performance was flawless.	1
Nolf 2 is one of the funniest and original games I've played this year. There is truly laugh out loud parts that make it extremely enjoyable. The tricycle and unicycle race comes to mind. I had very little technical trouble. I do have a 2 gig machine with pentium 4 and geforce4 ti4600. I probably don't have to say this but the graphics were awesome. Everything from the water and lava to the storms and tornados. Awesome. As mentioned by another reviewer, there are quite a few gadgets which I hardly ever used. I did go out of my way to try them all once anyway. Overall a very fun and visually pleasing game. One of the top action games of the year. Highly recommended.	1
Superspy Cate Archer is back, but since I've never played the first NOLF, this has no signifigance for me. The reason I bought it is because I liked the idea of a female spy, and because I'd read nothing but great reviews in gaming magazines. Plus, I had played a teaser demo of the Ohio level, and I thought that any game that has you chasing ninjas during a tornado is worth owning. The graphics are great, as are the cut-scenes and all of the evil characters that are running around. (I was hiding behind a building and I overheard two unsuspecting ninjas talking about poisoning their husbands!) Overall, the game is worth the money. The only complaint that I have is the loading between levels seems to take for-ev-er, which gets annoying when you keep on dying and you want to load your last saved game. But other than that, I'm having a great time sneaking up on the enemies, using crucial weapons, such as banana peels and killer kitty robots. This is a must-have for any first-person-shooter fan.	1
I didn't think NOLF 2 would be so good, but it is awesome. Much better engine, great multiplayer, and more. And Cate is back, tautin' enemies, bein' her normal super spy self, you even get to find super ninja assasins with swords!!! It's so fun!!! It requires pretty heavy systems though, not as heavy as ut2003. And the gameplay is great, much better lightning quality and texture/environment detail plus shadow quality, better sound effects, music effects, only by alittle.  Very Realistic Shadows, though I think they need to work on casting the shadows on to the models. Besides that, it's great!!  Awesome!! On my computer, as I believe it's an P4 1.7ghz, 256 mb ram, GeForce 2 mx,  WinXP, and more, It ran pretty fast and pretty slow. Yet the graphics are incredible, and so is the AI. Much better more realistic ingame cinematics, it requires an Pentium III 500mhz, 128mb of ram, 1.4 GB of HARD DRIVE SPACE, DirectX 8.1, 32MB 3-D Graphics Accelerator modern completeley compatible and supporting DirectX8.1 with Hardware T & L, it also requires an Windows Compatible 16-Bit DirectX compatible and certified sound card, 56kModem connection, and the OS is Windows 98/98SE/ME/2000 with latest service pack/XP.  They recommed P3 1ghz, 64 MB vid card same, same sound card just with EAX 2.0 support, 1.67 GB of Hard Drive space, cable connection, And that's all I remember. And the water is much better.  All I can say is this may end up being the 2002 action game of the year!!! I recommend this for any action/adventure gamer that meets or exceeds the minimum system requirements of NOLF2!!:)  I recommend GeForce 3, but GeForce 1 is required....	1
I like this game no matter what the people at the forum say. It is being critizied because it is shorter than the original, but that seems to be the norm now. I think it improves on the original in almost every way: graphics, AI, stealth sequences, action sequences, and skill points. It just isn't as revolutionary as the original, so it doesn't get 5 stars. It also has a few other problems that keep it from getting 5 stars: 1. there are some parts where going in guns blazing is your only option, this wouldn't be such a problem if you didn't have skill points. But it is really hard to take on a hoard of ninjas when you have put all your skill points into stealth, it also seems that you HAVE to put some points in your armor skill and health skill to even beat the game. 2. The siberia mission: it wasn't bad, it just wasn't excellent, it got better as you get to the end of it 3. respawning guards, this doesn't seem much of a big deal to me as it did to the people in the forum. The only time this got annoying was in the siberia mission, The other times it wasn't that big a deal. 4. multiplay, I love co-op but they should have included more missions Things that make this the one of best action games of the year: 1.the action sequences are some of the best of the year, just as gripping as the original nolf 2.the ending level is extraordinary, enough said 3. the music is excellent 4.the cutscenes are the best in-game engine cutscenes of the year 5. the jupiter engine is best use of the lithtech engine ever, looking better than the quake 3 engine 6. the replay value of this one make this just as long as the original 7. stealth sequences are also very fun, the AI is DEVIOUS That is all I can say without taking up the maximum of 1000 words I enjoyed this game because I didn't expect it to be exactly like the original.  If you were a fan of the original and live by it, you may not like this game. I enjoyed it totally though.	1
Cate Archer is back in a huge way!!!! NOLF2 is absolutely AMAZING!!! The graphics are absolutely incredible, even the actual game, not just the cut scenes. The storyline is once again very in depth as well as comical. I will make this short and sweet. With a new barage of weapons and gadgets to tinker around with. NOLF2 will most definately rank up to Game of the Year again. I am not exagerating. It really is that good. I have ALL of the new FPS(First Person Shooters) and this is by far my favorite. Don't get me wrong, I mean games like SOF2 are great, but most FPS are pretty close to the same story. NOLF2 not only keeps you interested with the unique arsenal of weaponry and gadgets, but the storyline is still "Austin Powers" like, with machine gunning. This is a must buy for any serious FPS gamer!!!! I have a 1.3GH P4 with 768MB RAM, and GeForce4 128MB TI4600 which most likely has a lot to do with how well my particular game performs. However, the requirements are nowhere near that, which means that almost anyone with a decent system should easily get good results with NOLF2. BUY IT!!!!!! IT IS SOOOOO WORTH IT!!!!	1
Chess is my favorite game. On chessmaster 9000 I've learned how to become a stronger player..I recommend this game to others.	1
It's a great game with a lot of options. Obviously you can play against bots, force bots to play each other, etc. However, you may not realize just how many tutorials there are (lots), or that you can create your own opening books in order to practice/memorize some of your favorite openings and/or games. There's a lot to this product, despite its age, and I recommend it.	1
The product features explain pretty well what this game covers and has going for it. I only have to add that it is extremely easy to set up, and has enough depth for most players. The graphics are pretty good for a chess game and the various boards and opponents types/levels (with included opponent profiles to find one best suited to your own game play) really add to the enjoyment. This is a great, inexpensive chess game and is good for beginner and more advanced players alike.	1
When you install this game, make sure you check on line for the fix files to fix many of the numerous bugs.  After running the fix I have not had problems.  Other reviews note the need for the CD to run the program.  My expeience is I can run it without the CD, but it does have a timing feature that requires you to start the program with the disk every 15 or so uses.  It seems to me a reasonable compromise and I don;t really find it all that annoying.  Piracy is real and you can't blame a company for wanting to protect their product as long as the inconvenience is minimal.  I don't find it all that annoying myself.  The features are good for all but the highest level training.  As a casual player, you have more than enough tools to learn the game and improve.  The tutorials are excellent.  The database is decent.  It could use a little better organization and streamlining on the menus.  I am able to access and run all features.  The playing engine uses every available process available so don't plan to multitask while playing a game or analyzing a position here.  It just won't work.  It does this, no doubt, to generate the strongest analysis possible.  It's ironic that this element is aimed more to the advanced player than to the casual player or intermediate player for whom the rest is targeted.  F0r high level play, there are better options.  For 95% of people just looking for a good game and some training to finally beat dad, this will do just fine!	1
It becomes clear that a system, a habit or a routine is in place when critiques of the perennial Chessmaster always begin with a few diatribes. How do we justify the purchase of a fully priced Chessmaster this year compared to the previous edition? Then the reviewers turn towards the product feature sheet. What's added? Is the artificial intelligence improved? Is it noticeable? I think the artificial intelligence has progressed so much that a good majority of Chessmaster players can't tell the difference. The final question always boils down to: Whether it warrants purchasing. I don't think any other game has caused critics to ask this question so much that game reviewers themselves are turning into cynical Wall Street analysts. Where are the profits? What's your guidance? Do you have positive cash flow? How can you justify your share value?  Humor aside, Chessmaster has actually gotten friendlier with the years to come. Nowadays, you can find a simple game of chess, even multiplayer chess on casual gaming sites. Yahoo and MSN, for example, feature parlor activities for new players. I know at least a few non-gaming peers who take part in these and think it's a way to cool off from a day's work. So why in the world would these people buy Chessmaster? So they can be beaten in a few more million ways? Yes, but Chessmaster 9000 also features a bundle of high points to turn any casual player of chess into a pro.  Still, it can be intimidating. Chessmaster has a refined kids-look now to cater to the young ones. You get to play with players of your own age (if you were 8 or 10 years old) and the layout becomes a lot simpler. For example, you won't be bogged down with the A3 to A2 type of speak. There are also tutorials and quizzes to guide you through the game. These are lengthy in nature. I believe one of the tutorials to explain and test you on forming forks and defenses ran at least 170 dialogue pages (not actual pages but still) which are fully narrated. The tutorials usually explain what the objective of the particular lesson is and then follows it up by guiding you through a few set matches. After that, they'll give you traps and puzzles from which you are to make the correct move. It's good for a refresher but most tutorials, even for simple things like capturing pawns en passant, run at least twenty dialogue pages. So if you are prepared to go by the book, you're going to commit some time to it.  The most productive way of learning, I found out, was just playing the game itself. You can select from a variety of players and as you play more games, you'll find out your true rating compared to the professionals. Chessmaster will also pitch similarly classed players against you but I found at every level, they were pretty smart; not prone to make any overtly stupid moves. The piece de resistance of this part is the fact that you can take back your moves anytime you want. Chessmaster won't punish you for it. And, the game has aids to show a lot of things to help you develop your game. You can have pieces that are threatened turn slightly transparent. A blunder monitor lets you know if you're about to expose your defense. It doesn't work constantly, per se. I've had it not warn me about some very bad moves but it keeps you on your toes. There's also a coach that'll constantly give predictions and analyze a defined number of moves ahead (by default it's ten) for you, so you can benefit from the artificial intelligence. But these aids are all in chess notation, so if you're not comfortable reading letters and numbers, you might want to try the analysis function which takes a few seconds timeout to churn out an end-game strategy for you. I'm not about to judge whether these strategies beat real computers like Deep Blue (in fact, they rarely work out the way the computer thinks it will) but I imagine it's doing something good if it chews up about 50% of my CPU time while I idle.  Chessmaster includes a comprehensive glossary of opening moves and defenses you can pull, organized by name. Savvy players can even search its libraries by moves. The best resource by far for learning is the classical library of chess matches included. It also happens to be the strength of this game, in my humble opinion. A number of brilliant matches from the 19th century up until last year are recorded here. Each game begins with a little blurb on how the match was setup and what its significance was to the world of chess. Chessmaster 9000 not only replays these classics but also offers analysis at crucial junctions. What if Kasparov did this instead of that against Deep Blue? How did Kramnik beat Kasparov to dethrone one of greatest chess players of our time? You can see it all play out and I only wished the chess mentor could offer such advice at critical junctures in my own games but that may be asking for too much.  Finally, Chessmaster 9000 plays its multiplayer over ubi.com, which supervises all the ranked and tournament games. You can also play directly over TCP/IP or LAN. Chessmaster's engine lets you save your moves at any time, even dump your game to ASCII boards, so it's great for people who need material to try to improve their game. But for novices, you might be better sticking with the parlor players unless you really want to improve your chess game.	1
Look out folks, despite there being no warning on "some of" the boxes (according to UbiSoft tech support), UbiSoft has brilliantly decided to prevent installation from a CDRW drive.  I have a Dell Inspiron 8500 that came standard with a Samsung CDRW/DVD drive, and I am unable to install.  Called tech support, and before I even got going, he knew exactly what I was talking about, and claimed there is no workaround for it.  I will simply have to return the game (even though I can't now that it's open) to the retailer and will not be able to play it until I buy a CD or DVD drive with no write/rewrite capacity just for this game. I don't know what genius at UbiSoft came up with this as a notion to prevent piracy, but I've got news for them, you're only hurting potential customers.  Blocking CDRW use on the disc itself isn't going to slow down some game cracker.  It's only going screw me up. So since there's no warning about this "feature" on Amazon, and as there's no warning about it on the box itself that I just today received from Amazon, I thought I'd come on here and let people know, lest they waste the purchase price as I did. These days, almost all laptops come standard with CDRW/DVD drives, why UbiSoft chose to cut off an entire slice of the market is beyond me.  Apparently this "feature" is now on all of their PC games.  So look out. I'm sure were I able to play it, it would deserve more than a single star.  But because I can't, and because I feel UbiSoft effectively duped me into buying by 'forgetting' the warning, I can't give it higher than that.  I'm not slamming the game itself, but rather their policy.	-1
Don't know how to play chess?  Wish you could play better?  Looking for an all-inclusive tutorial program, plenty of classic and well-annotated games, a monster chess engine, and hundreds of chess puzzles that will make you a better player?  This game is for you.  Looking for a perfect chess program with robust programming, good graphics and sound, and easy of use?  That chess program hasn't been written.  Hopefully we'll see that in Chessmaster 10K. The Chessmaster series is far and away the best chess software out there for people who are serious about learning chess.  A lot of work went in to preparing this program to be just that.  Unfortunatley not a lot of work went into the interface, which is horrible.  The graphics could have been improved with minimal effort - the 3D boards are so horrendous they might as well not have been included.  It is difficult to navigate from one section to another.  The online feature is particularly poorly designed and basically useless - but there are so many free online services that I consider that irrelevant. Despite its flaws, this game is still the game to buy.  If you are a novice and think playing this game's tutorials will make you a master - think again - but plenty of games against Chessmaster's excellent "personalities" of all levels will prepare you for serious play and certainly make you a better chess player.  Chess players seeking to hone their skills will find this program incredibly useful, since the mentoring aspect and advanced strategy sections are complete and easy to understand. This is definitely a program to own if you are interested in chess.  Those seriously concerned with sound and graphics may want to hold off until the next version, but if you intend to start playing chess now, click and buy this software now.  At less than $40, it is an amazing value compared to expensive chess books.	1
If you've never been exposed to Chessmaster before, you need to.  With a multitude of opponents with varying degrees of abilities, you will always be able to play a game against someone comparable to yourself.  The courses are very useful, not only for those who are just learning to play, but also for those who have been playing for years and are wanting to improve their game.  On the other hand, if you already own Chessmaster 8000, there is no compelling argument to upgrade to 9000.  There are some lessons that have been added, and new boards and sets, but otherwise there really have not been any serious changes.	1
Well I'm glad this program supports XP. I had to make sure before I bought it. I'm glad I did get it. From what I see so far this is a real winner of a chess program. There are a lot customizations that can be made to tailor the program to your skill level and there are many tutorials and sample games provided.	1
this game looks like the best motocross freestyle game ever made the graphics are amazing and its all freestyle thats awsome this looks like a game that every gcn owner should have.	1
woow that price is so high can you bring it back down to 75 please i beg you i really need theses games~!	1
This is a must have for any die hard Spyro fan! It will cure your case of nostalgia all in one product. I love this collectors edition because it comes with all three of the original Spyro games, and even though I am not a fan of the first one, it's still a must have for any collector. The games provide many hours of fun depending on how experienced you are and can easily be some of the best PS1 games ever made. This product is good for any age!	1
The first three spyro games are in the same category as movies like The Godfather or albums like The Dark Side of The Moon. You absolutely HAVE to play them, there's EVERY reason to play them, and you MUST play them. To this day, I consider them to be the epitome of the platformer game. Even games like Rayman 2 or Crash Bandicoot are extremely pale in comparison the the Spyro games. Over a course of three games, Spyro traverses the most beautifully diverse and vibrantly colorful realms practically bursting with hidden magic and wonder. Icy cliffs, scorching deserts, medieval castles, dank swamps, sky cities, hot volcanoes, deep oceans, sunny Greek city squares, foreboding metropolises, Arabian castles, bug infested farms, wet springs, the list goes on. the first three Spyros will offer you not hours, not days, not weeks- but a lifetime of joyous memories. There's no reason to explain why to get it, just get it!	1
On my original Playstation I bought all of these games sepreatly when they first came out, and absoulutley loved them! And now all 3 games in the series are together in a ... collecters pack, so this reveiw is for all 3 of the games, so here it goes! Just let me start out by saying these are the most fun and challenging platforming games I own, and that includes all the Crash Bandicoots. The graphics are great and there is just so much to do in them all it will blow your head off! These games are all about Spyro, a young curious dragon who always keeps away evil out of the Dragon Worlds. There are so many types of worlds, inclucing arabian, ice, dessert, robot, farms, dinosaur worlds, space, mountains, underwater and many more, all with great colors and suprises around you all the time. The games also have great instramental musical scores like those of Rayman, and are full of magic and numerous enemies all that fun and challenging to beat. The characters, ( which are all whimsical and creative,) of these worlds ask you for your help, and in return give you many prizes and clues to aid. Combined in the series, you collect many items to help you with your quests, including tailismans, orbs, and my favorite, gems, which are your currency and are scattered all around in the relams' towers, cliffs, sea-sides and just plain everywhere! Spyro also makes many friends, and has many abilites including gliding, flying, head-bashing, swimming, breathing fire and ice, charging, super-charging and fluttering. The Spyro games are also quite simple, but may take a few extra hours to unlock everything and beat all of the speedway records, so you truly never get tired of them! After the first in the series, Spyro, the others to follow just got more beautiful and imaginitive in all aspects and way to enjoy them. For any fantasy and adventure liking video game player, the Spyro series have everything your looking for. There's no way to go wrong with a dragon!	1
its a good modern combat flight Sim. not many play Online but with the mission editor and built in missions this Sim will entertain for years.	1
Lock On: Modern Air Combat (LOMAC) is easily the worst combat sim made in the past 10 years, with awful controls, bad graphics and a rushed release it is the absolute epitome of lazy game design on a budget. You're much better off buy Wings Over Europe or any other Thirdwire sim as they have a better modding community and a very good mission designer/campaign system.	-1
Without the proper video card the graphics on this game DO NOT work.  Everything is blacked out where there should be graphics.  The system requirements don't tell you that you need a high end graphics card for this game to work.  I contacted Ubi software.  They told me in an email that I should use a GForce FX graphics card.  At other websites they suggested a GForce 6600 graphics card with at least 256MB of memory.  These cards range from $100 to $150.  If you don't have the proper card DO NOT buy this game.	-1
Well I was reluctant to pick this up. A friend advised me that it didn't run on his top of the line PC. He said that it was fine until clouds and weather affects were added and then trouble occured. Anyway eventually I found it in a discount bin and decided to pick it up. It runs brilliantly on my machine, absolutely flawlessly. My box 2.8Ghz, 1Gig Dual Channel Ram, ATI 9600 Extreme.  I was so impressed I went and bought myself a set of X45 Saitek HOTAS gear. How much fun is this. Blowing away bandits in an F15 without ever having to touch the keyboard. The sound is only in stereo unfortunately so I can mix up my EAX settings to run it on 4 speakers but a 5.1 setup would have been nice. The graphics put MSFS2004 to shame. It took me a week or so before I was comfortable flying the Eagle and there are more planes to go. The game has a great level of depth and I printed off the Flaming Cliffs manual which helped some too (all 262 pages). Campaign builder takes a little time to figure out - like the whole thing really, but this isn't a console game this is a complex piece of software. Saying all of this the game isn't for everyone, it takes time, patience and an attention to detail to get the most out of it. I spent a week or so readjusting settings till I was happy. Neverthless this has helped my love and interest of flying and quite frankly this piece of software is a hobby for me rather than a game.	1
I bought this game about a year ago, and had a really difficult time mastering the learning curve. Since the documentation was so sparse, I mostly laid off trying to master the avionics and just flew it like a dogfighter, flying Sues, MiGs and 15s in "guns only fights, and then just marveling at how beautiful the game was. Mastering navigation and landing was itself a challenge, but I just loved staring out from the cockpit during a descent and feeling very much like I was in a real cockpit in air....the illusion and immersiveness was that real.  Eventually I moved onto other games, but I never removed this game from my hard drive. It felt like a keeper. Now a year later, I've patched it, put some of the add-ons in, and I'm still learning new stuff! I've finally mastered the Su-27 BVR mode and CAC mode. I've also learned how to effectively use EOS and have successfully won missions with it. This is one of those games that you have let grow on you.....at this point I have virtually no doubt that LOMAC is going to be the Falcon4 of the next 5 years. It is going to be slowly patched and modified while hardware grows around it.  I am running an Athlon 2600, with 1GB of PC3200 RAM, and a Radeon 9700 on Windows 2000 SP4. There are a few graphics options I have to turn down, but the game is extremely stable (0 crashes) and gives me playable framerates about 90% of the time at a resolution of 1024x768. Overall the game is very scalable and needs to be tweaked to get the happy medium between performance and eye candy depending on the capabilities of your machine.  I literally can't wait for my next upgrade, and wonder how great this game will look and fly with a fast 64-bit CPU and a next gen video card.  This is a great simulation, and one which will reward you with priceless satisfaction if you are willing to invest the time and effort in learning its intricacies.	1
If you are not technically minded, don't buy this game.  If you don't know the difference between a directX 9 card and a directX 9 compliant card (one works with DirectX 9 but does some of it in software and is useless for many modern games), don't bother.  If you have a computer that is not correctly configured, don't even think about it.  If you expect to run the game and play well within an hour, stop reading now. Now for the rest of us, the ones who are sick of console games and know how to build their own machines so that they run well, irrespective of the age of the components.  The ones who are prepared to sit down and actually learn how to use a program, and know that a third party manual is the only way to even begin to do justice to this simulation (it is *not* a game)...  This one is for you. Runs well on my 9500 pro (heavily overclocked, with an artic cooler mod), XP2000+ processer and 1Gb RAM and with all of the simulation settings set to high except water quality and view distance (set to low and medium respectively) - as per the manual recomendations (hint for all the folks with low frame rates!).  Mine is not a high end machine, but I took pains to work out what the most stable drivers were for everything before installing this game (catalyst 3.7 for the video, plus latest VIA sound drivers for my onboard audio), because I knew it would be a demanding game... not on hardware, but on software configuration.  Mid range hardware seems okay on all the latest games, but it is drivers and general software config that causes problems, ddespite what some of the other reviewers seem to think. Know what?  It worked first time, and it worked well.  I'm enjoying going through the LOMAC manual (the one published by Digital Aspirin), learning how to play this beast, and when you get into the zone it is absolutely great. For example, in one mission, I am tasked with shooting down a valuable and well protected AWACs plane that is patrolling off the coast.  It is protected by a pair of F4s and there is a patroling squad of F16s nearby.... all of which totally outclasses and outguns my pair of MiGs.  So its a case of tactical flight - flying undetected with stealth (passive non-emitting sensor modes), and a BVR attack on the AWACS from behind, placing the F4s in a position where they are furthest away from my escape vector when I de-cloak and initiate the attack.  Following my stike on the AWACS, I head for the deck running, using the mountains as cover and using the low level air density to significantly cut missile range (yes, it even models that!).  A long chase follows, with the two F4's and my wingman buying it in a short but fast dogfight, when the F4s elect to cut their altitude for speed and catch up.  But I make it home, low level all the way to avoid lock-ons by the F16s, who were following at high altitude taking BVR pot-shots. Exhilarated is the only word I can use when I made it to my side's air defences, and watched the F16s turn and sulk back home...  Mission Accomplished! Now that's gameplay.  S	1
I've been messing around with flight sims since the days of the Compuserve Falcon Challenge Ladder and flying against aces like Victor "Duke" Z.  When Falcon 4.0 came out, I was really impressed, followed by really depressed when Microprose/Hasbro raped and abandoned it. The out-of-the box experience will depend on how much effort you put into reading the manual, and setting up the game based on the abilities of your machine.  If you're in a hurry and just want to blow stuff up, you might be a little disappointed. The graphics are nice, but not much better than IL-2 Sturmovik. The learning curve is there, but you have to remember what this sim is and what it isn't.  It's not Crimson Skies. All-in-all, I'd have to say this is a very good sim with a lot of potential, but not as great as all the hype made it out to be a year ago.	1
Well, the game was just released. This is a 5 star Sim, but there are lots of bugs right now. On a very positive note, their web based support group is excellent. What is really cool is if you are not the type to have 4 weeks to get the sim 300 keys down, you can "dumb it up" a bit. still real tough, but plays a bit more arcade like for those in the Novalogic F-22 Lighnight 3 arcade gamer, but with far superior graphics and real avionics even when "dumbed up".  Support these guys, they are very talented.  Look for a patch shortly. When it comes out, this will rate 6 stars. It is for the die hard sim fan that has been waiting so long for a great sim, and an arcade type, that wants to push it a little more past the days of Novalogic F-16 MRF, Mig29, and F22 Arcade style.  It will still be tough, but not nearly as bad as it could be.  It is a step up. If you flew the Novalogic series, itn't it time to step up a bit?  For value... as you get better, you can turn off some of the auto-mode and it is like a new game, without having to spend a dime more. If you look at the support site right now, give it is BRAND new (like 1 week), there will be bugs in such complex software. Watch the site for the patch announcements then buy away. It will be a LOOONG time before anything this good comes again!	1
So, my appreciation of the Wipeout Series actually began with the two PSP titles (Pulse and Pure), which are great games.  I understand that the PS2 Fusion was a significant departure in the series from the previous Wipeout games.  However, I have never played those games and can only judge it as a stand alone game or in comparison with the PSP sequels; in either measurement, I really enjoy this game.  The controls aren't as seamless and the gameplay is not as smooth as the PSP versions, but the graphics are comparable (though, on the smaller screen, the PSP games look relatively much better).  Wipeout Fusion is a really fun hovercraft racer that combines strategic use of weapons with racing-oriented considerations.  My one criticism would be that this iteration in the franchise relies too heavily on weaponry (even more so, arguably, than the two PSP games), making it play sometimes like a souped-up, more mature version of a kart racing game (which isn't necessarily bad - just realize this is not a pure racing game).  However, my reservations about this game are few; while fans of the original games may be disenchanted by  Fusion, I think it's a fun and perfectly serviceable weapons-based racer for the PS2.	1
Wipeout Fusion has been hailed as the game that killed the Wipeout franchise.  Before Fusion, Wipeout 3 killed the Wipeout franchise.  Before 3, there was criticism by the hardcore race gamers of Wipeout XL.  If you play each game in order, you see that the series has evolved from a slick, mean physics simulation to an arcade game.  For that reason, and not having the Design Republic's neo-deco billboards floating around the tracks, this game got flushed by the fans.  Too bad.  Fusion is loaded with beautiful tracks, with corkscrews, loop-de-loops, jumps, high-dives, you name it.  Basically all the best parts of a rollercoaster, only armed with weapons. In league mode, you can make modifications to your vehicle's stats with your winnings- a nice touch if you're fond of a certain craft. And mercifully, the learning curve is more gentle.  You won't get to the fourth track and find back to back right angle turns waiting for you.  Part of the joy of a racing videogame for me is a believable feeling of speed.. I like a straightaway or a sheer corkscrew drop at 500 mph now and again.  This game delivers.  At the end of the day it's great entertainment for under 10$.	1
While I won't say this the best Wipeout game ever made I will say it's very, VERY close to being the one. This game will definitely have you on the edge of your seat. For those of you not familiar with the franchise I'll just say a few things. GET FAMILAR! The Wipeout game series is all about high octane arcade racing. You are behind the controls of an anti-gravity rocket speeding across various tracks all the while not only trying to outrun your opponents but also outgun them. Weapons are added to the gameplay to help slow down your opponents or knock them out of the race (and get you out in turn). Put all this together and you have the best sci-fi racing franchise ever.  Now to what makes Wipeout Fusion different from the others. First off it's on the PS2 and with that comes greatly improved graphics and processor power to make the vehicles go fast. Really fast. While the previous games had great graphics and you indeed went really fast the PS2 puts a little edge on all that.  There are a ton of courses compared to the others. While many of the courses are the same track in reverse or with a few detoured changes it's enough to make the difference. A new feature on Fusion is the ability to tweak your vehicle. Make it stronger, faster, more maneuverable. And with those changes the ship actually starts to look different. Nice touch.  Wipeout has always been known for killer electronic dance music soundtracks and this is no exception. You get some nice mixes of songs from Orbital, Future Sound of London, Luke Slater, Plump DJ's and more. You get a ton of them too. Something like 16-18 songs, which is a lot more than any previous game. The music isn't as eclectic as Wipeout 2, but fits perfectly for a driving game (probably my fave Wipeout soundtrack aside from Wipeout 3).  There are some differences I noticed in gameplay. You take damage a little more than normal now. Little scrapes on the sides of the road cause damage when before not so much. There is no instant replay like on Wipeout 3, which is a shame considering the sweet graphics. The AI is a bit deeper on this one, with actual personalities coming from the opposing drivers. You get to know their names and they easily enough become your nemesis when they keep you from winning.  It's not the best Wipeout game you can have. It could have been if they made some adjustments (like instant replay) and took a few more of the best the other games had. As it is you should definitely pick it up. Especially at the prices you can get for it now. If you like arcade racing of any kind you will love Wipeout 3	1
Pretty good game.  It's a futuristic racer that is recieving acclaimed reviews.  It was pretty cool when I played it so I can see why it got the reviews that it did.  Good job BAM!	1
I go back to the original Wipeout in the tall box for the (now called) PSOne and have always loved this series.  This latest installment does not disappoint.  Highly recommended for any racing game fan. PROS *  Very different handling characteristics for each ship - you'll have to alter your driving style when you switch teams *  Upgradeability of each ship, although this gets rather easy once you've got at least one super-ship in the stable *  Beautiful graphic design of ships, courses, menus, etc. *  Different modes of play (career/league, mission/challenges, etc.) plus plenty of courses plus different vehicles equals  limitless gameplay CONS *  Occasional graphic flaws (clipping, going off-course) lead to head-scratching moments *  Some individual challenges are extremely challenging to the point of frustration	1
The fourth coming of Wipeout. Is it all we hoped for? Well, that depends. The gameplay has been signifigantly altered. The ships are now easier to control, feeling less "floaty". Enemies are now much closer together, and attack mercilessly. And if you don't get a shield recharge pretty often, you're probably going to go up in flames. Technically, Wipeout Fusion is somewhat of a mixed bag. The graphics are nice, but not great. The frame rate is usually steady, but not rock solid. The sound is sweet, and the music easy on the ears. The controls aren't too bad either. But the presentation, that's another story. This game features some of the worst load and save times I have ever seen on the playstation 2. Every time you enter a race, you wait. Every time you save, you wait. After a while it gets annoying. And the menu music is absolutely terrible. In short, this game is good, but not great. And the reason why is simple. This game was sloppily made. Despite al the delays in development, this game was realeased in what I would call an unfinished state. Is it worth playing? Oh yes. Worth buying? Almost definitely if you're a fan of racing games. It's just not the greatest racing game ever made. And that I can live with.	1
The 4th episode in the Wipeout Saga, Fusion was originally set as a launch title for the PS2. During its 2 years of delays, other games tried to tap the formula(Extreme G Racing , Kinetica , Star Wars Racers Revenge) to mixed results. Now the game that started it all is back, and Im happy to say , mostly lives up to its reputation.   The first thing is the control. There was nothing better than making that perfect lap in Wipeout Xl or Wipeout 3 , the control of those games was dead on. Fusion has a different feel, ships feel more 'on rails' than previous games, almost making it harder if your used to the physics of the older games. But a little time with it, and I was screaming around the tracks like the old days, and as you progress and the better ships and higher speed modes come, the control is fine.   There are a few graphic problems, which is why I didn't give it perfect marks. There are polygon pop up's , and when the action gets heavy, the framerate slows down, making it difficult to steer. Those problems aside, the graphics are great, crisp track designs, and little touches on weapons are spectacular. Dust kicks up when your off track and on the ground(although its a nod to pod-racing that should have been left out of Wipeout) and the ship designs themselves are high polygon and very cool.   The soundtrack features great tracks by the likes of Orbital, Timo Maas, Luke Slater, Hybrid and more. A much more breakbeat feel this time, but the tracks are fitting and sound great.   All in all, its not perfect, But the best thing out on PS2 of this type. With tons of stuff to unlock, and awesome 2 player weapons, youll be playing this a while. :)	1
Well i'd like to start off by saying i'm not some 7 year old person here to write about how I think Mario will be fun. I am a 12 year old who has every nintendo system and every Mario game released in North America. So I know what games are the best and what to expect from games in the future, and I think this new Mario game is going to be great. It seems like gadgets are common in Mario's recent games. Luigi has the poultergeist 3000 and mario has what appears to be a tank of water on his back in this adventure. I don't know much about the game, yet I can tell you what I do know. The graphics are bright and colorful. The framerate is smooth. The plot is that Mario and Peach went on vacation to a town on the beach. There someone disguised as Mario wrote Graffiti all over town. The townspeople are enraged at Mario. So Mario's mission is to clear his name by capturing the villain all the while avoiding the angry townspeople. I'm sorry if my review seems short but remember the game is still four months away and facts are scarce.	1
this game has a lot to do. with an expansive story mode full of puzzles, minigames , bosses, and pokemon type battles that help you collect more charabombs it is well worth the money. There is also a multiplayer mode that is pretty fun...it give you a lot of options to tool around with also. the reson I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the multiplayer wasn't as fun as the one in bomberman 64, but thats my opinion. If you liked the 64 games (except for hero which I thought was horrible) than you'll love this game, but if you are really really low on cash just wait and get eternal darkness cause that game is going to be amazing...oh yeah this is about bomberman...Go Bomberman!!!!	1
Bomberman has become a classic action game. And now the classic is reborn on the Gamecube. Using the Gamecube's graphics capabilities to the limit, Bomber Generation uses the "toon-shading" function. This function makes gamers think that they are controling a cartoon Bomberman in a colorful environment. Many might think that Bomberman Generation is childish. They are very wrong!! The game is simple to control, but hard to master. Each level keeps getting more difficult every time you proceed. There are 5 massive worlds to explore and 18 areas in each one. Not to mention huge bosses, secret mini-games, and an awesome multiplayer. Check the complete list of features below: - Bomberman reborn on the Gamecube. - Uses the "toon-shading" function to give it a cartoon look. - Uses the Gamecube's maximum power. - Explore 5 massive worlds with 18 areas each one. - Fight huge bosses. - Use bombs to attack your enemies, break trees, or even to find secrets. - Various bomb-types including the Hurricanebombs and the aquabombs. - Awesome multiplayer including 5 modes of play. - Up to 4 players can participate. - Play tons of mini-games and solve many puzzles in the adventure. - Uses a 360 degree camera for your viewing pleasure (pick your favorite angle). - Muliplayer is based on old-shcool arcade. - New multiplayer modes include Paint Mode and Coin Mode (and the classic battle mode). Overall, a must buy to any gamer looking for a real action game. ANY PERSON WILL FIND THE CONTROLS EASY TO USE!... Simple but challenging!	1
As a budget priced title (now), I think the game is great for multiplayer for casual gamers or non-hard-core gamers.  I find it highly replayable and find myself playing multiplayer with a casual gamer frequently.  It is easy for casual gamers to pick up and plenty of strategy for other gamers on the mulitiplayer.  It is very basic, the way you can play tetris over and over.  I like the short games and tournaments.  The computer AI is decent and can be adjusted to easy/normal/hard.  The single player was very bizaar.  Not familiar with bomberman single player, it started out looking and playing like a game for 2-year olds, but was actually quite challenging later that probably would be very tough for casual gamers.  The voice acting was so oddly paced and the animations & graphics were so odd, I was just intrigued.  It was fun to play through once as a suprise on top of the multiplayer, which is all I bought it for.	1
It would have gotten only 1.5 stars had it not been for multiplayer. Basically, the story mode sucks. All the levels have the same design even though they are set up differently and have some different puzzles. I don't really get the pokemon inspired buddies that help you. And water bombs aren't all that good.  Here's where multiplayer comes in. It looks very cartoonish, which is good. The converyer belt, pipe level, basketball court, and meadows are great designs and well-executed. I like how you can turn the revnge on or off. And I also like the little soccer part that determines what the winner for a power-up.	1
B.G. is the latest Bomberman gamefor the Gamecube. The graphics aredone quite nicely. The stages get harder as you progress through the game. I was surprised how the bosses get harder to beat in the latter stages of the game. The best thing about this game is the multi-player mode. You and up to 4 buddies can get together and have endless fun. This is a great party game for all ages.	1
The Bomberman series has long been famous for its mastery of the multiplayer genre.  Yet again, the little pom-pom headed one returns with a series of multiplayer games that will keep gamers of all ages lining up to bomb the stuffing out of each other.  Dodge Mode sharpens your defensive techniques, as you do your best to punch, kick and dodge various kinds of bombs (including those pesky bouncing mobile ones) that fall from the sky, whereas the many incarnations of Standard Mode allow you to nuke your neighbor with warp platforms, hidden tubes, momentum arrows to go with the wealth of powerups Bomberman fans have come to expect.  Those would be enough to keep most fans busy and entertained, but Generation keeps the action fast and furious with other wholly different adventures such as Coin Battle, Reversi, and an explosive take on the arcade classic Whack-A-Mole game, just to name a few.  All in all, a gamer could completely ignore the deep and engaging one-player adventure (which has its own entertaining complexities and cartoonish charm nonetheless,) and find hours and hours of fun with a few friends in the multiplayer mode that has come to define the Bomberman name.  A worthwhile purchase for any gamer with infinite replay value.	1
This is the first bomberman game ive played and its pretty cool.  I just don't understand why bomberman sounds like a girl.  He looks like a tough guy and talks like a little girl, oh well.  Its not a game I would buy.  Maybe ill just rent it till i beat it.  Rent this game first.  If you like it and want to buy it go ahead.	1
I play bomberman online for dreamcast and I was alot fun .This vesion should alot of fun too	1
very fun and vthe grapics are awsome its worth the money u should buy this when ever u can get a game its gona blow you away	1
works fine	1
Yes it's a Mario Games however impressive looking it is it cannot get past it's shortfalls. first off the controls are ass especially if your trying to am at something. Second the camera angles are just atrocious they move and do weird things that you keep scratching your head going wtf did it do that???? that simply makes you more and more frustrated playing this game. I see the potential they were going for in this game but unfortunately it just didn't live up to it. However you can totally see where they got splatoon from.	-1
Came with a few scratches but overall playable and a great game	1
Why are all Mario games so nostalgic? Is it the music? The bright graphics? I will never know but this is a great addition to my classic game collection. It will never be better than Super Mario 64, but it's really fun. I think this game is ideally for 10-12 year olds.	1
It's one of the best Mario games out there, get this game now! Seriously, I still haven't found a better Mario game out there, Galaxy comes close but, I still feel that Sunshine here is the best!	1
Great Mario game.	1
Game works great, no problems at all. It feels great to relive my childhood with this game. I purchased my copy from Auction hunters Treasure chest.	1
Good music, fun game.	1
I remember buying two Super Mario Sunshine discs on purpose. One for me, and one for a friend. I got mine, but the other disc was never received. That's too bad I guess.	1
If Milius had created the screen version of 'Conan the Barbarian' using Disney-style animation instead of live action, I would have expected the result to look something like this. Don't let the harmless-cartoon appearance fool you though; this is an incredibly violent game full of animated bludgeonings, dismemberments, and impalements. Get it for yourself, but don't let your kids near it. The visuals in this game are a joy to behold. During level load-times, different 2D sketches are either displayed or drawn in while you are waiting. When the sketch solidifies into the game environment you'll be knocked flat by how good the 3D version (that you play in) looks... The designers poured a lot of hard work into the art and it really shows. The levels are all very different from each other (temple ruins, Atlantis?, dungeons) and populated by different enemies, but each is beautifully drawn and animated. The difficulty of the missions ramps up slowly and there are training opportunities between the missions so you can learn new moves and new weapons. The first few missions emphasize stealth; the later ones center on battles against large numbers of opponents. Puzzles are very, very simple so as not to distract you from the main task of killing lots and lots of enemies. Usually, all you must do is fight your way through to a switch that opens the exit for the next part of the level. No block puzzles, no Rube Goldberg contraptions, just big, barbarian-friendly levers to pull. If you're a fan of the MGS style of stealth missions, there's a nice stone age twist to the whole radar thing that lets you know where your enemies are (and where they're looking). In Mark of Kri, your companion is a bird who acts as a second set of eyes. At different places in the game, you can send him forward to a vantage point and see the world from his eys. This lets you get the drop on baddies who may be hanging out just around the bend or patrolling the walls overhead. As a game device, this feature is very well done. The combat system for this game has gotten a lot of press and it's fairly simple, and enjoyable, to use. The right stick is used to assign button presses to nearby enemies and pushing the appropriate button uncorks a weapon strike against that enemy. By leaving some of the buttons unassigned (i.e. targeting only 1 or 2 enemies), you can use them to modify the main strike to deliver more damaging combo attacks. The bigger weapons have larger targeting cones so you can group 2 or even 3 enemies to the same button. Terrain makes a difference as hitting stones or walls on a swing will interrupt your combos and hitting a tree or post can result in your weapon being stuck for a few seconds! This helps to keep the combat from devolving into pure button-mashing as you have to keep maneuvering to better positions or switch to a weapon better suited to confined spaces. The final battles pit you against a dozen or so opponents at once and by then you'll have the hang of one vs. many fighting so that you can sit back and enjoy watching body parts fly as you wade into the crowds with your battle axe. Did I mention this was a really, really violent game? OK. The big downer. The game is very, very short. The timestamp on my completed game reads a little over 8 hours. I haven't completed all the mini-games or unlocked all the artwork/costumes/movies, but it only took 2 days to finish the main story. On the other hand, Mark of Kri is at a lower price point than the typical PS2 game, so it's balanced out somewhat by that. Bottom line: Too short, but very, very satisfying to play and full of creative, well-executed ideas and artwork. It definitely deserves a spot on your shelf.	1
thanks	1
Yet another crazy Mario adventure definitely fun and very much worth playing just like all the others has its difficult parts but is fun the whole way through.	1
game works great!	1
The fighting gameplay is very innovative and revolutionary. It's hard to describe but you'll see how unique this game is in terms of action. It's also fun using the different weapons, especially the huge axe.	1
Any hack and slash stealth game is awesome. As long as there are health restore cheat, or infinite hp cheat.	1
How this masterpiece slipped past me is nothing short of mind-boggling.  Being that I'm Samoan, I appreciated the fact that this game starred a Samoan protagonist; which is a rarity. Anyway, Mark of Kri is a hack and slash/stealth hybrid and semi-platformer which features brutal combat along the lines of Conan or God of War. Onto the review-  Graphics-  The graphics are some of the best on PS2; and could easily pass as a Gamecube title. (though to be fair, Gamecube games look much better than this game) Mark of Kri looks like a Disney movie with all the extra frames of animation and the art style. There's even a cool transition between in-game concept sketches and the actual in-game graphics in which every level transforms from a sketch to the actual character. This is something that hasn't been utilized in gaming much. The frame rate is smooth, the colors are vibrant and the backgrounds range from a jungle atmosphere to candle lit temples with giant Dharma statues or perhaps a waterfall with lush vegetation surrounding it. There are occasional graphical problems along the lines of screen tearing or some flat textures that look washed out, but this doesn't occur often. All in all, the graphics were great.  Sound-  Mark of Kri doesn't feature much music; but does feature lots of environmental sound effects and dialogue. The voice acting is excellent. The environmental effects range from birds chirping or water rushing. Perhaps even insects buzzing. The music which pops up ever so often really gives you the Polynesian vibe with drumming, deep bells and a few other instruments. But nothing major. The music is actually very short and is delivered in spurts.  Gameplay-  Mark of Kri gives you control of Samoan protagonist, Rau. The game features storytelling in the manner of "past tense" which is told by perhaps Rau's pupil. Anyway, your job is to rid villages of thieves/bandits/baddies. Mark of Kri features a deep and robust fighting system that is quite different in comparison to many games. The game's engine features parrying, countering, stealth attacks, instant kills and such. The combat is satisfying and brutal. You're able to decapitate heads, stab an enemy through his neck, chest, face, stomach/pelvic area and there's even blood. Whether you're parrying, countering or using combos, the fighting system is commendable. One thing that I wasn't crazy about was the absence or the right analog stick camera control. This is because the right analog stick is used to highlight your enemies during battles and a button prompt will show over their heads so that you're able to attack everyone no matter how near or far they are. The feature's intuitive but presents problems with seeing everything around you. Thankfully, L1 is a first person camera view in which you're able to look around every where. You're also given control of a bird that helps you in every level by scouting out viewpoints or perhaps retrieving an item or activating a switch.  Being that I won't spoil the story in any game. I'd highly recommend buying this game. It's cheap, has good graphics, a deep combat system and is a PS2 exclusive. This is perhaps one of Sony's best on the PS2. And although it pales in comparison to God of War or perhaps games like Genji, it still ranks alongside them.	1
Thank You. I received the game today, I was supprised at how quickly it got here. It was in great shape, thank you again I look foward to playing it	1
An ancient evil stirs; an impatient adventurer sets out from an insular village that has no other warriors (at least none that ever appear or help you) but is mysteriously well-equipped for training them. The story is the best part about this game after the graphics, but there's nothing here you haven't seen better before. Most of it is forgettable, but acceptable to get you from point A to point B provided the gameplay or graphics don't put you off. Story: 6/10  The game went with a relatively painted sort of cell-shaded style, watching the scenes "written into being" as the game's equivalent of cinematics is mildly interesting but loses interest. Some people will automatically dislike the apparently cutesy graphics, others will be off-put by the limb-hewing and spurting blood. I didn't think they worked well together, but look up gameplay videos on Youtube to decide for yourself, this is one case where what you see is what you'll get and you may either like or dislike it. Graphics: 6/10  There are some cries of anger, pain, and ambient noises that all seemed fitting. There weren't spectacular effects or voicing (more than a few of the lines are corny), but I thought that it fit the general tone and theme. Sound: 7/10  The background music is rather bland, not especially annoying but a pale shadow of what video game music can be. Music: 5/10  Gameplay is where this game really falls apart. Moving and trying to get the camera to cooperate was clunky and uncooperative. The combat felt rather awkward and unpolished, I had the distinct impression that it was rushed because there was a variety of "combo attacks", but none of them were really more effective than mashing the attack buttons and if you're fighting multiple opponents most moves won't be available anyway. Lack of effective smart targeting or good lock-on didn't help, and if you'd been mashing away at one enemy and they fell Rau was liable to continue hacking in that direction while three more soldiers bear down on him from other directions. I believe one word describes every stage of this game, including combat and "platforming": clunky. Gameplay: 3/10  There are little rewards and minor easter eggs you can unlock by accomplishing sub-missions within areas, such as utilizing certain combos, but none of them really helped gameplay and nothing felt worth the time and hassle of going back. Replayability: 1/10  For all of the "our game is unique" hoopla, I wish they would've spent some more time refining the play and areas. It looks like a cartoon, spurts blood like a survival horror, and will probably annoy you like a screaming baby. It definitely doesn't flow or captivate. Definitely rent before you buy, and if you can't try it first I would recommend seeking other games first, there's nothing here that isn't done better elsewhere. Overall: 4/10	-1
(enter review here)	1
This game gets a definite thumbs-up from me. It is equally well crafted in its gameplay, graphics/sound, and atmosphere. The story is not bad for a non-rpg, though you won't get a whole lot of character development.  You are Rau, a young warrior trained to fulfill a prophecy and protect the land from a vile clan that wishes to unleash powerful dark magic. Through your quests, you develop your skills, expand your weaponry, and uncover the plot to bring about your own downfall.  The graphics are GORGEOUS! The environments you play through range from tropical jungles to ancient cities in winter. The art direction here is primo. It all seems to have influences from the barbarian fantasy genre with ancient south american/ polynesian motifs mixed in. Very cool.  Play control was excellent. The game uses a unique targeting system that allows you to quickly shift your focus during combat and even allows multi-targeting  for some of Rau's wider ranging attacks. Stealth kills are also an option, allowing you to thin out the herds of enemies before they catch on to your presence. The ability to send out your bird helper is a nice touch, allowing you to plot your strategy and find a way to take out as many baddies without getting overwhelmed.  It definitely pays to learn the different melee combos and know which weapon's are most suited for a certain situations. Once you get skilled in combat, it feels good to mop the floor with a group of enemies that used to give you trouble. This game is definitely not a typical button-masher. In fact that's a good way to a quick death. So if you like combat games that require a little more thought in combat then this is a good choice.  The story is a simple one and does not involve a great deal of dialogue. In fact I don't think the main character gets any at all, which is odd considering the story mostly revolves around him. But the characters you do meet are interesting enough. Rau's trainer could have used a different voice over though. I've heard the voice before somewhere (you'll know what I'm talking about when you hear it). It reminds me of one of those 7-foot tall smoker's voices that shout out deals in a sinister tone on national car commercials. "Get great deals on 2006 SUVs with no money down." Kinda took me out of the element when I heard him during training sessions.  Overall, I highly recommend the game. If you want a better than average combat/action game, you'll find that this is one of the better games in the genre.	1
This mark of kri game is fun but only like three levels long! This has plenty of blood, gore, and violance for me but it is just too short for me. The good thing is though I only bought it for two bucks at game stop!! So overall this game is fun but too short!	-1
ok, i played rise of the kasai(sequal) before i played this game so thats why im tired with it. Theres only so much fun u can have with this game. In rise of kasai at first i was like this game is great, this is cool. The characters are cool but I got bored. Why did I get bored? Its a simple clunky hack n' slash game with an ability to stealth around but why? This is supposed to be one of the best underrated games?? pleeeaaaase	-1
I knew when I got this game that it was unique and that it was going to be good. After playing through the whole game I can honestly say that not only were my expectations met they were exceeded. Mark of Kri gives a fantastic combination of keen graphics, compelling story, and an innovative combat system that rivals that of the coveted Lord of the Rings games (Two Towers, etc). I'm not kidding here. I played both Kri and Two towers. If I had to pick which combat system was best Kri wins hands down.  Other reviewers have better elaborated on the combat system so all I'm going to say is the way they lay it out for you to be able to attack multiple opponents and make combo moves is seamless. On top of straight up combat you also get to do some pretty gruesome stealth kills and distance attacks with a bow. Did I mention gruesome? This game is brutal. It doesn't take long before you are decapitating enemies and before the game is done you will be hacking off limbs like there is no tomorrow. So parents keep that in mind if your 8 year old wants to play it.  I really like the graphics on this game. The characters look like what you would expect to see in a Disney cartoon or game. Except one, which is a bartender that reminded me more of a Muppet than Disney. The character you play is just plain cool looking and a total bad-to-the-bone type without all the stereotypes you come to expect from a character like that. But anyway you have these Disney, styled characters going nuts with all this violence. The irony doesn't escape me, but that's not why I like it. The artwork is stylish and just plain good.  The gameplay on the first few levels is kinda like training. First you just fight with your sword on the first level. Then you train on stealth attacks on the next. Then you train on ranged attacks after that. Basically your known skills and weaponry go up as you keep moving forward. Eventually you end up becoming this almost unstoppable killing machine taking down dozens of opponents. Oh yeah... and the ending is just plain cool (which makes me happy since many games tend fizzle out on the conclusion).  If you like action games this is a good one. If you like having tactics in your combat then you will like Kri even more. If you like all that and intuitive gameplay, stylized graphics, and decent game story then Mark of Kri meets ALL of your needs.	1
You're a warrior, a rookie at best...  Now trained in the arts of combat, you itch to kill and use what you've learned in the field.  You're a bit naive and dull witted, however you're kind and willing to help anyone that's in need.  Over the game is fun and interesting, especially the tied in of the story line (told through the point of Kuzo).  However the fighting can become repetitive over time.  Through stealth, and will power, you're to stop an evil madman and bring peace to the world.  Not to mention rescuing your sister.	1
Most people have never heard of this game....pity, because the perfect and very original action/stealth package it offers makes many more popular games pale in comparison.  In each level, the main character is given a new weapon or skill.  By the end of the game, you will have access to 3 VERY different weapons, very sweet stealth moves, your bird (who provides different vantage points to decide how to approach a situation), and your bow.  The rare detail here is that these are all VERY well-implemented, giving you choices on how you want to approach the level.  The combat is very addictive- you can map certain enemies to the four buttons on the controller by sweeping the right analog stick.  That, combined with a handy block button provide for some very strategic combat.  Or, you can take on one enemy at a time with some truly brutal combos.  The brutality, both in combat and in stealth kills, is truly something to watch- your character looks like he walked out a Disney movie, but his moves DEFINITELY betray this notion.  The art actually was provided by former Disney animators, so the game looks very good.  Just watch one of the load scenes morph into actual gameplay- you won't believe your eyes!  Meanwhile, the story, though short, is told by a very talented voice actor and entertaining cut-scenes.  Once you finish the game, it offers plenty of replay value- there are extra arenas and goals to get through, and you can unlock extra costumes for Rau (which actually look very cool, I might add).  Anyway, this is one of my absolute favorites, and I can't wait for the sequel!	1
The game is a classic, played multiple times over, never gets stale	1
Very fun and challenging. One of the hardest Mario games I have ever played.  I found myself getting very annoyed and irritated with this game and it sucks how about 30-40 stars are from blue coins. I was expecting more levels, but overall it's Mario and still mostly fun. I highly recommend!	1
I HATE THIS GAME IT WAS FUN TILL THE LATER UNPLAYABLE LEVELS OPENED UP. WAY TO SCREW THIS GAME NINTENDO DO YOU EVEN PLAY TEST YOUR GAMES? CAUSE THE LEVELS I GOT STUCK ON WERE NOT FUN. THEY WERE NOT FUN IV BEEN STUCK ON THE STAND BIRD WHO TURNS SIDEWAYS, SENDING MARIO TO HES DOOM. THIS STUID BIRD MADE ME RAGE 2ND ARE THE COURSES WITH NO FLOOD EXTREMELY TEDIOUS & EXTREMLY STUPID 3RD THE FIRE PAINT & CHAIN CHOMPS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT SCREW THIS GAME	-1
This game was requested by my daughter.  She loves anything Mario brother's.  It's the first games she played as a young girl and won't ever give up her Mario brothers even tho' she has lots of games without them.  She likes to go back and play them again and again.  They are fun games that provide lots of group play and interaction with others.  Can't beat that with a stick!	1
In search of good game hunting, I've found the Mark of Kri. This game has an excellent tutor system through out the game makes much easier to play the game. You move like a ninja but you fight like a warrior. You seek and hide but you chop and slash. It's got all the great things you like in any great sword using action games except no jumping, no puzzles, too much health and too easy. You can hold block button entire time and you won't even get scratch unless an enemy is firing an arrow at you. This game would have been 5 stars if it had more manuvering capabilies and controlls... Although it was a short and easy game, the Mark of Kri was brilliant.	1
BUY THIS GAME. You will love this fame. It's a little misleading. At first it has this Disney-style. All cut scene are tradition drawings. The game play goes against all Disney when you thrust your sword into the bad guys, or chop their heads off. There is so much blood and the main character is so violent that seriously all other bad guys start to run away in fear. The only draw back is this game is terribly short, and makes you play the game twice, which is not a bad thing. This game utilizes the second analog controler(finally put to some use) and allows you to mark up to six bad guys for a bloodfest.	1
*illustrative story* You slide slowly along a crevassed wall, muffled sword bumping gently against your side.  The dulled clang of armored feet rings falsely in your ears, an obvious trick of echo that could lead to a mistake your training would never allow.  Your exhilaration rises with the jangled din, an opportunity you will not allow to pass.  At the critical moment, you spring around the corner, grab your unsuspecting victim--muting his tell-tale screams with your swathed hand--pin him against the rough wall, and swiftly stab your sword into his caved throat, silencing all struggles. He slumps to the floor, a sightless, disgarded husk.*/illustrative story* And this only describes the heart-racing feeling one should feel when performing a stealth kill!  Imagine what an all-out brawl would inspire...this game, a work of deadly beauty, gaming bliss.  I could describe the game mechanics in detail, but the synopsis already here does this well-enough.  So I decided, "why not try to describe to people actually playing the game feels like?"  Though I slightly exaggerated my description (in-game sound does not work in so sophisticated a way, but one can certainly imagine), I sincerely felt this way when playing.  This game allows one to enter the body of a true brawler, one very capable and quite impressive to play. The gameplay never became boring because the player has numerous weapons at her or his disposal and areas to explore.  In this respect, I felt the game's short length actually worked to its advantage:  how can one become tired of an excellent game that only lasts about 8-10 hours?  The developers included much without having to resort to game-lengthing repetition.  Though I desired more, this left me craving and only feeling residual sweetness...nothing marred my experience.  This says something strong, I believe. Considering this game's reasonable price, I highly recommend all who read this purchase it.  I found it for $30, and never once regretted my buy.	1
Hundreds of years ago, mysterious forces created a spell with the power to open a passage between the world of darkness and our world. No one was able to fight against its terrible power before it could be invoked, the spell was stolen and smashed into six parts. A millennium later and the spell had become just another tale among many told around campfires. But then one day the six parts of the spell came back to the light, giving agents of evil a chance to recreate the world to their desire. The main character, whom you play as in the game is named Rau. Rau is a young warrior: muscle-bound and armed to the teeth, he's in training to face his destiny and hopefully save his people from this evil curse. As Rau you must venture out and defeat evil where you can find it, using steel, skills and stealth in Sony's latest action adventure game. Mark of Kri has a unique combat system, specially designed to take on surrounding enemies all at once. The way this works is fairly simple and easy to pick up. Rau has a spinning arrow that helps him to locate and mark enemies around him (time slows to allow this though). Once marked, each enemy has a controller symbol above them. Rau can then hit the button to his the desired target, and this in turn allows Rau to attack any of his enemies in any direction. Reasons for buying it: -Unique battle system -Varied weapons -Stealth and vicious action -Great storyline, brilliantly illustrated -Secondary character to add original tactical element. Reasons to leave on shelf: -Rau is a little slow at running (!!!) (you must be thinking surely there are more reasons, but no!) Overall Verdict: -8.9/10 (89%) A great action adventure wrapped within a superb story. The battle option and cheats will occupy you for six months onwards.	1
OHH SHIP!! this is a good game.this game is has one of the best stor lines i've ever seen in a game.it has allthe aspects of a grate game, and losts of gore to go with it. this game dus not hold back when it comes to violenc. i meen this guy is smashing peopls heads ,cuting heads off,etc.. this is a grate game for the teen and older but not for the little kid. that is way it is rated "M". one prblem i have is the targeting , you have to target some one if you want to hit him/her, rather then just attacking them. in some cases this is good but it gets old after a wile. I reomend renting it, But if you don't like renting game go bay this one. That all for me.	1
I've been playing this game like it's going out of style. Most of my friends were surprised. "What, the one with the water jet pack?" Absolutely.  This game offers puzzles similar to Mario 64/Galaxy. It is essentially a sandbox style game with innovative environment/gadget changes. The thing I love about the Mario series and Nintendo in general is the fun. It can be frustrating at times, but it is always fun.	1
Mario's trip to del fino island was a vacation to remember through the ages! I wish they would've made a direct sequel to this amazing game.	1
Bought this for my boyfriend, and he just loves it.  Very good price, too.	1
You should emulate this, though.	1
Takes about 10 tries until we can get it to play!  Seller did tell me to return for refund, which i totally forgot, so that wad my fault!  So A+ to seller ,but negative to the game we received!	-1
I've played this game so many times I've lost count, it's one of my top favorite games. I love the bright colors & gameplay, it's such a fun game. ^^	1
WHEN I FIRST PLAYED THIS GAME , I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS OKAY. BUT AFTER PLAYING IT A BIT MORE , I REALIZED HOW GOOD IT REALLY IS. HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE A BARBARIAN GAME , THAT LETS YOU ANNIHILATE YOUR ENEMIES IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS . IT'S GREAT WHEN YOU CAN DISARM YOUR ENEMY AND GET TO USE THEIR WEAPONS AGAINST THEM . OR TAKE OUT ARCHERS WITH YOUR BOW AND ARROW , OR EVEN BETTER- SNEAK UP ON THEM AND KILL THEM BY SNAPPING A NECK ,  BEHEADING THEM WITH YOUR SWORD , OR SMASHING THEIR SKULLS INTO A WALL !!MY ONLY COMPLAINTS ARE THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY SAVE SCROLLS IN THE LEVELS , WHICH WOULD BE GOOD SINCE THEY ARE LONG LEVELS.OR THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY HEALTH POWERUPS EITHER. BUT BEYOND THAT , THE GAME IS ORIGINAL AND LOTS OF FUN!SO IF YOU WANNA PLAY A NEAT GAME THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE '' CONAN '' THAN THIS IS IT ! GET IT NOW AND ENJOY ! BUT GET THE GUIDE , AS IT HELPS A LOT...	1
I'm an older game-player so it takes me a bit longer to finish games...I just don't have the free time I used to. Now having finished THE MARK OF KRI, I'm dropping my rating down to 4, from 5. The game is a lot of fun...lots of action, no stupid puzzles, lots of blood and gore and slo mo. The fighting system is also really creative. SPOILER: The ending of this game is REALLY anti-climactic, however. Your little sister is kidnapped, there's an evil menance collecting the Marks, and there's this tease of a waitress who always gets in your way in the tavern....well, the rescue is COMPLETELY uneventful, there's no special boss fight with the bad guy (and there SHOULD BE, since he shoots lightning out of his hands when you're killing his undead henchmen), and there's no mention of the destroyed tavern, the people who were in it, or that waitress who kept rubbing against you. The lose ends should really have been tied together better, to give the game a sense of completion. There should have been a difficult boss fight at the end. There should have been a cinematic showing Rau and his little sister going back to town, with the waitress waiting for him. And all those Marks should have played a bigger role. Heck, I only collected 5 of the 6 and still managed to finish the game...they almost seemed irrelevant. It's not a bad game. It's a great game with a bad ending.	1
Eleven hours and forty-three minutes is how long it took me to beat this game. And I enjoyed every bit of time it took me to do so. Almost 12 hours doesn't sound like much, but in my old age (31), I am realizing I like the games that can be completed without devoting my life to finishing it. This game has everything that makes a good action/adventure game - incredible graphics, good control, fantastic hand-drawn artwork, imaginative environments, befitting music to set the mood, etc...  A new feature to the action/adventure genre is the addition of the bird, Kuzo. The bird's ability to fly ahead of you and scout out the lay of the land is very cool and works very well. This game has many moments of full-on combat with numerous enemies, as well as times when it can be played with Tenchu-like stealth missions. I enjoyed this game very much and will look forward to the continuing adventures of Rau and Kuzo.	1
Cartoony look, terrible control, shocking violence, repetitive gameplay.  The cutscenes are hand drawn still pictures.  The main character -Rau- is difficult to move about and he gets stuck on everything.  Collision detection is terrible.  And as for the "innovative" fight controls, it amounts to little more than button mashing. Halfway through the second "mission" -walk along and kill everyone you come across- your sword begins to get stuck in something every time you swing it.  Frustrating, dull, and stupid.  I quit.	-1
One of the BEST gamecube games to hit the stores. If you like Mario and a free running world games you'll love this game! A must buy!	1
I got this game a couple of days ago. I am amazed by the graphics. They look like Ico but smoother and better all around. The story is really good for a game of this type, or for a game of any type. The narrorator seems like he actually cares and is really into the story (he is the person the the main character, rau, is now training). There are many ways for u to get the jo  done, there are about 7 or 8 different stealth kills i think. And there are many combos that you can learn, and some that you can find on your own. One unique thing about this game is that you can make your bird go up to a perch and look at what the enemies are doing to get an advantage. The bad guys don't suspect anything because its just a bird. You have many option of which to attack. One complaint of mine is that it takes too long to switch between your weapons. There is concept art between load times, and they are fun to look at and you may not be done by the time that it is done loading. An example of the detail in this game is the feathers (i think thats wat they are) on Rau's pants will flow in the wind or when he runs and walks. They made it possible to do so many things and made graphics so good that you will want to finish this game for sure. This is truly how the PS2 was meant yo be used. This is one of the sleeper hits of the year, err, at least it seems like it, it might become more popular.	1
I bought this game because it sounded interesting. When I got it and first started playing it I thought it was going to be like Half-Life. Another adventure type game that was out of its time (Half Life was good when it first came out. But it doesn't compare to Deus Ex). Nevertheless, after about 30 minutes playing the game I was shocked that it was a very complex fighting game! You really need to "learn some skills" to get good at this game. It's not a first-person slasher where you just go around hacking people up. If you tried that you'd get hacked up yourself in no time. No, you need to learn how to *master* your sword fighting skills, stealth mode, and bow. When I looked at the box I thought it was a Japanese samurai type game. It's not. Think Mongolian. Think Huns. 400 AD - 1400 AD time frame. Rau, your character, has the body of a barbarian, but the skills of a Hun/Mongolian swords man. He has bow skills too and is no way just a big muscle-bound guy. You also have a black crow that you have trained to help you during your jobs. You can make the crow fly to predetermined perches so that you can get a birds-eye view of what's around the bend. You can also have your crow fetch items for you that are out of your reach. I've only played this game for about 3-4 hours so far and I can tell you this. It's not going to be easy. You have missions. And each one gets harder and harder. Since you need skills to master the sword, you better have strong hands since this game requires that you are constantly pressing the button to fight off your would be attackers. There is a nice feature that lets you attack multiple foes at once. You can take on three enemies at one time! It's quite a nice setup how easy it is once you master the controls. But that doesn't mean that the mission will be easy to finish. If anyone remembers Deus Ex; just like that game, you could play it using different methods. One, you play it head-on (fight everyone). Or two, you can be a sneaky (stealth type mode). You can use your sneak attack, or you can use your  bow from afar. It's your choice. The AI seems very smart too.  The enemies aren't dumb. Once they see you they will look for you. But, some times they might just hear you and think it was  just an animal or something. Then, they go about their business. And sometimes if they hear you (but don't come after you) they will just keep waiting for you until you come around the corner (Basically, they know you are hiding. But they won't come and get you. They just wait for you.). Right now, I'm only using the sword and bow. But it looks like there are 5 weapons. But, it's NOT about the weapons that makes this game good (Quake or Unreal). It's the mastering of the weapons that makes the game! There are some nice side games (Arena style) where you can hone your skills for prizes. There's also a tutorial that you can play that is called "training." In the Arena practice you can take on 15 guys at the same time. Once you get good at that you'd be surprise how much that helps you during real combat. But, remember. That doesn't mean that you can just start hacking away. Sometimes it's better to just sneak around a corner and grab someone and take them out silently (if your in that mode). So, if you liked Oni (from Bungie) and Deus Ex. You should like this game. They should have called this game The Mongolian Warrior. P.S. The Sage is a funny old bag!	1
This game is a visual masterpiece.  I love the opening movie and the deep story, the visuals are "drawn" on the screen as you watch a scenario setting up the tone of the level/game.  A dark and deadly spell that was seperated into six portions, given to six families for safekeeping has been found once again by the demons of legend. You must battle your way through legions of bandits and other nasties to find the truth about the happenings in your world.  To aide you on your quest is your faithful and intelligent spirit companion, Kuzo.  Use his bird-sight to help you look ahead and spy on enemies.  Infiltrate their ranks with stealth or brute force. Either way, Rau is a massive warrior and a force to be reckoned with. With many objectives to complete and items to find, this game is deep and involved.  You can unlock extra outfits, arenas and cheats as you progress through the game. While the unique targeting and battle system may take some time to get used to, the game provides an excellent training module designed to help you familiarize yourself with the controls and basics of combat. The load times between levels can get irritating, but the lush artwork and compelling story quickly make up for any grumblings and misgivings that one may have.  A popular magazine rated this game as "flawed" and a "nice try, but falls short."  I am happy that I disregarded this advice and purchased this well-done piece of software.  Blurring the line between animated movies and video games, The Mark of Kri does an excellent job on both ends. The gameplay is fluid and easily mastered, and the addition of the new battle system and the "bird-sight" only assist in pulling you further and further into the game.  While it looks like a kiddie cartoon, this one is aimed at mature audiences, the combat and blood and gore aren't meant for children.  It isn't over-the-top, but it does definatley show that current trend in video games: adult audiences. As the gamers of the world get older, and the hardware becomes more powerful and advanced, so do the games.  This is one game that manages to keep pace and stay with the flow.  With its rich and involving storyline, vivid graphical presentation and ease of control, The Mark of Kri has secured itself a place in many a gamers library.	1
My copy of MARK OF KRI arrived Monday morning, and geek that I am, I've played through the first two levels...this game is a lot of fun. First off, it looks great. Great art direction and pretty good character animation (though the lead character runs a little on the slow side). The Disney-esque stills are also quite nice and add to the production value. Game play is easy to pick up and pretty original. I like the ability to fight multiple foes in a bloody battle and, on the fly, to change your opponents. Fighting 4, 5, or 6 opponents can be pretty nerve-wracking. Battles can get bloody...it'd make Conan proud. Swinging that big sword and seeing heads fly is pretty satisfying...almost as rewarding as plunging it into your victim's writhing body. Nice! Overall, I think MARK OF KRI holds a lot of potential. I had to force myself to stop playing because I need to get some work done...but so far in the first two levels,  I was met with a lot of action. Sneaking around to grab your enemies from behind makes it even more fun. But the biggest relief was that, aside from a few levers I had to pull, there were no stupid puzzle or crates that needed moving/destroying. This game's got a really nice barbarian feel, and I found myself already wanting to see the movie. They gotta make a movie. ;)	1
This is the sleeper that made it through the cracks of the video game industry and came out on top.  This game offers so much and puts out much more. Animation/Graphics:::  Think Jak and Daxter animation and flow, think Onimisha action (but with it's own unique fighting system), think Metal Gear Solid 2 stealth; mix those games triple the fun factor and you have Mark of Kri.  The look of the game reminds me of Mulan and the Emperor's New Groove, but with a more mature presentation.  It seems to have become that American animation is best familiarized with Disney or Don Bluth animation.  Just as Japan has their animation style, it seems we do as well.  The difference is that most Japanese animation is pretty violent (okay, sometimes they can be very violent).  So, think of this as our American version of that.  It's American style animation (i.e. Disney style) that is violent. Rau (the main character) can kill/battle his enemies many different ways.  For instance, you can sneak up behind an enemy and either break his neck, cut his head off, use your sword to staple him to the wall, cut him from bottom up, on and on).  Rau has so much animation to him. Control/movement of characters:::  The controls and fighting sytle may seem difficult at first, but once you do it a couple of times it becomes cake (training is recommended at the beginning and when you get a new weapon).  The fighting system is unique as in I have never seen this way used before in a game.  You use your right analog stick to target an enemy or enemies.  Then a button icon appears above their heads (square, X or circle).  When attacking you can press the button that corrisponds to the enemy you want to hit with the selected icon over their head.  There is a lot more to it, but like I said, once you get it, it is actually easy. The sound::: the sound fits the game well Fun factor::: I can't stess the fun factor of this game.  I didn't think anything of this game when I first saw a preview, but after reading a few reviews and seeing how everyone rated this game high (check on gamezone.com).  I was convinced there must be something to this game.  You have a number of attacks, a number of weapons, you have your faithful sidekick Kuzo (a bird that can be used to seek out enemies, help out puzzles, help with ladders and switches....like Beastmaster.  You can see through the eyes of Kuzo whenever you want). In closing, I am not good at writing reviews in text.  I can sit there and tell you all about it in person, better than my review.  What it comes down to, is that I highly recommend this game. I am a 20-something long time console video gamer.  I own and highly recommend the other following games for the PS2 ((also gives you an idea of what type of games I go for))::: Grand Theft Auto 3 Medal Of Honor: Frontline Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty MLB Slugfest 2003 Red Faction Spider-Man Dynasty Warrior 3 SSX Tricky Max Payne Jak And Daxter NCAA College Football Frequency and now::: Mark of Kri ... go and buy it	1
The Mark of Kri is not a game for kids. Its lush animation, and soft, almost painterly graphics may at first appear to be geared towards a younger audience, but the first time the main character, a barbarian named Rau, cuts an enemy's arm off, then turns around and cleaves a foe in two, it becomes obvious that the style is no indication of the target age. That said, The Mark of Kri is a beautiful game, whose presentation is second to none. The innovative combat system allows for both interesting one-on-one battles, and more chaotic multi-person battles. Essentially, using the right analog stick to target an enemy will cause an icon corresponding to one of the PS2 controller's buttons to appear over an enemy's head. Until you either "stop focus", or kill the enemy, hitting that button will target that enemy. If fewer than three enemies are targetted (the triangle button serves a different purpose, as do the shoulder buttons), the unused buttons become attack modifiers, allowing you to do different combo attacks, providing some much-needed variety. The game isn't strictly about combat, however. Rau is able to sneak about, and kill his enemies stealthily, and he is able to snipe enemies using a bow he is given. The variety in combat techniques gives the player a number of ways to approach problems in the game, giving it a bit of nonlinearity that's not standard in an action game of this sort. Rau's "sprit guide", a bird named Kuzo, provides yet another gameplay element. Rau can see through Kuzo's eyes, and as such, can send the bird ahead of him, so he can plan how to best attack the enemies that lie in wait. The Mark of Kri is an interesting, varied action game. It's not tremendously long, but doesn't lose your interest, with lots of options to unlock, and a good amount of replay value. The graphics and animation are reminiscent of a Disney film, the feel of the movie, and the narrator, are very Conan-esque, and the abundance of gore, as a result of the excellent and innovative combat engine provide a game that, at first blush, may look like an overly violent kid's game, but in execution, is a wonderfully differently stylized game, made for adults. Great stuff.	1
I just picked up my copy of THE MARK OF KRI today and at first I have to say I was disappointed in some ways.  I just wasn't grasping the gameplay mechanics.  About two hours later I thought to myself "give it another chance...". So I poped it back in and prepared for another round of fighting.  This time I turned up the brightness on my television and that made it a lot easier to see. Well two hours later I was still playing.  I figured it out within a half hour.  And once I found out how fun it was to play I was hooked.  There is zero frustration to me.  I die a few times but I keep going.  It is so much fun to slash these Disney-like characters. BUT it isn't perfect.  They are some SMALL glitches in the graphics.  Sometimes the gameplay causes you to get hit but several enemies at once.  The AI is fairly challenging and doing stealth attacks will become second-nature to you within an hour.  And the death animations are sick in a good way.  The sound is fairly good along with the grpahics but the best part is its like a violent Disney cartoon with voices to match that format. But as in any video game the bottom line is in the value.  Is THE MARK OF KRI worth getting?  Yes it is.  The attacks will get teadious and using your bird Kuzo will eventually become a little tiresome.  In the long run though you will get hooked on this game.  Its worthy of some of the attention its been getting because its something new. I won't bore you with the story details except saying you control a huge swordsman named Rau and his bird Kuzo.  And you will be happy to know that you can unlock a few items such as new costumes for Rau by beatting levels.  And there are only four weapons to chose from not including your fists. Heres a rundown of the weapons: FISTS: Only good for sneek attacks and disarming enemies but the only thing is if you use disarm to much in a battle your enemies will become wary of it. BROAD SWORD: Your main weapon in the game but its length causes you to get hit more then if you use the.... TAIAHA which is a long spear or the BATTLE AXE. When it all comes down to it playing games are all about having fun and this game is fun so I recomend it to any PS2 owners who don't mind a little blood and gore.	1
This game is the closest game to tribal Tenchu that I've seen.  The graphics are excellent, and the character modeling is spectacular, even the bird Kuzo.  This game is very much melee-oriented; however, stealth is involved somewhat.  Unlike other games, such as Metal Gear Solid 2, there are limited save points; however, you can choose when to save once you collect these save points ("save" scrolls).  The controls admittedly are not the best, but you can adjust after an hour or so.  Unlike Tenchu, however, you have a bird Kuzo to scout out the situation before you choose to attack.  For example, you can choose to stealthily attack some and blatantly attack others.  The focusing feature of Rau when he attacks is very innovative, and you can adjust to fight different characters simultaneously.  The environments in this game resemble Metal Gear Solid, in that you do have limited space to move, but you can move freely.  My favorite things about the game are several.  First, the use of Kuzo as your eyes in the sky is cool.  You can examine enemy movements from a distance.  Next, the stealth animations are absolutely brutal.  They make Tenchu look like child's play.  For example, in a double stealth skill, he breaks the neck of one enemy and beheads the other LITERALLY.  Even worse, in a single enemy stealth kill, Rau picks up the enemy and swings the enemy's head into the wall 3 times (!), smashing his head and neck with blood spewing everywhere.  Tenchu never got this brutal; and Metal Gear Solid 2 never saw blood spatter like this.  Lastly, the plotline via Disney characters and sketches makes this game incredible, and at this price of [$$], it is definitely worth it. Sony made a valuable and unforgettable game.  This game surpasses Tenchu (presently), Spiderman: The Movie and Batman: Vengeance in its gameplay, concept and stealth and the respective stealth animations. One note: When you buy this game, this game has a Mature rating for a reason.  Rau is absolutely and assuredly brutal and unforgiving, and blood will spill -- everywhere.  Although the characters are very cartoonish, resembling Disney characters, the incredible brutality of Rau ups the rating into Mature. This game for all action/adventure fans, especially Metal Gear Solid or Tenchu fans.	1
A classic must have.	1
I love this game! Mario Sun Shine is such great game!	1
An under-rated and excellent platformer game. Super Mario Sunshine provides a breath of fresh air by mixing the classic Mario play style and adding the new element of water spraying to make an interesting platform. Good story, excellent gameplay. music, and graphics for the time. It's a must have for anyone who wants a completely different Mario experience.	1
nice Game	1
Excellent. Thank you very much.	1
Great Product	1
Cool	1
Great Game, hours of fun!	1
excelent	1
The game is everything I remember as a child, it's just such a great working and quality game!	1
I don't like this game because there is a hard level in it.  There is a hard level in Ricco Harbor and if you get a weak time you lose and have to start over.  This is a suggestion for people who hate super mario sunshine: super mario Galaxy is a better game.	-1
Fantastic game	1
excellent product. exactly as advertised and arrived very promptly	1
little pricey but it works great	1
All time great!	1
FUN	1
great game a little weird compared 2 other mario games but its still fun	1
Great game	1
Fun game but lacks the variety in level design SM64 had.  All levels are south pacific themed so no cold cold, lava or snow worlds to explore like in SM64..  The levels are large and this time you have a water jet pack to help navigate areas otherwise inaccessible.  It's a fun game but not on the same level as its groundbreaking predecessor.	1
This is a good product, I like it	1
This is one of the best mario games of all time and not just because of the nostalgia	1
awesome. Love it.	1
The game of Super Mario Sunshine is a good game i used to own it but at the moment I try to buy it  and end up getting a bad copy from the seller but the game it self Damn good game, Good Game	1
Super Mario Sunshine After Super Mario 64 set the bar for one of Marios greatest game in order to keep up with Sonys Playstation Segas Sega Dreamcast a sequel to Super Mario 64 had been in the works for several years; the cancelled games Super Mario 64 2 and Super Mario128 were some ideas Nintendo had for a direct sequel Super Mario 64 2 was said to be developed on the Nintendo 64DD, but ended up being canceled. For those who don't know The Nintendo 64DD was a disk system attachment for the N64 like the Sega CD for the Sega Genesis. The first games to be released for the new system would be SimCity 64, Mario Artist, Pokmon(Pocket Monsters) and Mother 3. There were only very limited quantities of the 64DD were made available through stores. As a result, the 64DD was only supported by Nintendo for a short period of time and only ten games were released for it. Most 64DD games were either cancelled entirely, released as normal Nintendo 64 games as cartridge-based storage sizes had increased, or eventually ported to the next-generation Nintendo GameCube console. Super Mario Sunshine has some good things but with all that said lets begin this review  Story/Plot: Mario sets out for Isle Delfino for a vacation with Princess Peach, and her long-time steward Toadsworth. Upon a rough plane landing at the island's airstrip, they find that the once-pristine island has been polluted and plastered with graffiti. As a result of this pollution, sun-shaped objects called "Shine Sprites", the island's sources of power, have disappeared, and the island is covered in a perpetual shadow. The culprit seen spreading the graffiti is disguised as Mario, who is named "Shadow Mario". To help with cleaning the airstrip, Mario finds FLUDD, a powerful water cannon which is toted like a backpack and is also created by Professor E. Gadd. Mario is promptly arrested after the player defeats a slime-covered Piranha Plant at the airstrip which makes the hole in the runway disappear and recovers a Shine Sprite, falsely accused of vandalizing the island. He is put on trial, however it turns out to be a mere kangaroo court where the judge immediately finds Mario guilty and orders him to clean up the graffiti and recover the Shine Sprites. Until then, he is forbidden from leaving the island until he does so. The next day, Mario begins his adventure to find a way to clear his name and locate the real criminal, while restoring tranquility and order to Isle Delfino. After defeating another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rising a disappeared statue out of the ground, they see Shadow Mario on top of the statue for the first time who jumps off the statue, grabs Peach, and runs off with her. Mario chases him and takes him down and he creates a graffiti portal on the restored statue and escapes through it. Mario follows him through the portal that leads to Bianco Hills, one of the other areas of Isle Delfino where he defeats another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rises a disappeared cliff, some trees, and a section of a wall out of the ground and recovers another Shine Sprite. After defeating two more slime-covered Piranha Plants and restoring the disappeared boathouse and lighthouse that unlock portals from Delfino Plaza to two of Isle Delfino's other locations, Mario follows Shadow Mario, who has kidnapped Princess Peach, and has escaped on a Bowser-designed boat to Pinna Park, an amusement park located just off the coast of Isle Delfino's "tail". There, Mario defeats a huge Bowser robot being controlled by Shadow Mario which is called Mecha Bowser by firing water rockets at it on the roller coaster. It is then revealed that Shadow Mario's real identity is Bowser Jr., the youngest son of Bowser. Bowser Jr having been told by Bowser that Peach is his mother. (Mario: Peach how could you? Peach: But I don't even reme. Mario: no physically how could you?  )  Bowser Jr wields a magic brush that creates graffiti and is also created by E. Gadd. Bowser Jr turns the remains of Mecha Bowser into a hot air balloon and escapes again with Princess Peach. When learning the truth, Peach is visually upset for a second. He is last seen heading for Corona Mountain, a volcano where Bowser is holding a family vacation of his own. After Mario continues to clean Isle Delfino, retrieving Shine Sprites, and defeats Bowser Jr., still disguised as Shadow Mario, at least once in all of the areas of the island, a flood falls upon Delfino Plaza, opening up a cave that leads into Corona Mountain that Shadow Mario disappears into. Mario enters the volcano, defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by flipping over the hot tub they are in and rescues the Princess. Mario and the Princess fall from the sky with Bowser and Bowser Jr. While the others are plummeting down, Princess Peach floats down to safety using her parasol. Princess Peach lands on an island beside Delfino Plaza on her feet, but on the same island, Mario gets his head stuck in the sand, but gets out. However, FLUDD becomes damaged during the battle with Bowser, supposedly beyond repair. The Shine Gate's power is restored and the Toads repair FLUDD shortly afterward and Mario, Peach and the others resume their vacation, while Bowser admits to his son that Peach was not really his mother.  Okay I have minor problems with this 1. When Bowser Jr was about to take Peach to Corona Mountain why she did just jump off when she had the chance. 2. Why was Mario arrested for a crime he didn't commit? Lastly the benefits if you didn't get 120 shine sprites Incomplete ending After the credits, if the player has collected less than all 120 shine sprites, a picture shows Il Piantissimo, a sprinter that Mario raced during the game, finding the brush that Bowser Jr. used to vandalize Isle Delfino. Completed ending however, if the player has collected all 120 shine sprites, a picture of the entire cast with the words "Have a relaxing vacation" is displayed instead. So we get a freaking post card. Not as impressive as getting the 120 power stars in Super mario 64.  Gameplay: Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Like Super Mario 64 obtaining Stars, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites. In this game, Mario is joined by a robotic backpack named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away slime and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Spray and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Spray nozzle lets Mario squirt a stream of water which he can use to clean slime, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. Meanwhile, the Hover nozzle lets Mario hover in the air for a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps and spray things below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can substituted with the Hover nozzle; the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles uses water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit it asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot, and use its tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which can change its color. Yoshi will disappear if it runs out of juice, which can be replenished by eating more fruit, or falls into deep water.  Story 4.5/5 Gameplay 4.5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9/10 = A-	1
Those are the words of my son and I have to agree.  I wish this was available on a newer platform.	1
I did not realize you could play Nintendo Gamecube games on the Wii. This was one that my son wanted....hard to find at the used video game stores.  I have to say that Graphics are pretty decent for a game that came out a long time ago.  Remember you need a memory card to save.....game is great!!!	1
I love the GameCube, from looks and design alone, it's one of the best game systems ever. This game was the best game on it, for me by far, and is still held among my favorites of all time. It can be easy enough to finish a mission in less than a minute. It can be hard enough to make you yell at the TV. And everything in between. But no matter what, it's always fun! It is a true nostalgic experience. I truly feel that this game holds a very innocent part of my life. P.S. Nearly half of the 1 star reviews are about how their order was scratched or late, ect. and should not reflect on the buyers decision.	1
Though used, this product works wonderfully. It was everything I was intending. Anybody looking to purchase Player's Choice games, this is one to get.	1
har-har, Mario has never been better, travel through holograph doors to different parts of the beach for challenging mini-adventures that test your skill and strategy in this 3D paradise under attack!  i get stumped by video games quite easily, but i only have to use cheats/solution guides every 4th or 5th mini-adventure here, fantastic !!  still looks good !!	1
Awesome game for the game cube. Decent shipping time. Worked perfectly, and highly recommended to anyone who loves the mario games.	1
Awesome game. I love this game it's absolutely fun I let one of my friends borrow my original copy i had and he returned it all scratched up. So i got rid of that that copy and went on Amazon and got a new one because i liked this game that much.	1
If you love mario you will probably like this game. The storyline isn't your standard Mario storyline, it's a bit quirky and unique but that in itself makes it a good game to play.  Everyone has their own interests but if you like Mario this is a good one to play.	1
Super Mario Sunshine is now considered the weak point of all the big name Mario titles, and for good reason- it's really lousy in several key areas.  Almost all of them in fact.  For those of you that grew up with the 2D Mario games, this game will feel lifeless and dramatically different in comparison.  For those of you who approached Mario with the Galaxy series... you'll have the same reaction.  The lowest point of the Mario series is Super Mario Sunshine, unquestionably.  Let's name all the problems-  The entire theme of the game, with the exception of a few platform-dominated missions underground along with a ghost house maze area, is based around the beach.  The ONE environment that feels totally out of place for a Mario game (the beach) and Nintendo actually thought it would be a good idea to roll with it.  REALLY disappointing.  I'm totally used to the Mushroom Kingdom by this point and expected as such.  I'm pretty sure most Mario fans feel the same way.  Incredibly disappointing that Nintendo abandoned the Mushroom Kingdom for something so generic.  Nintendo should have executed a beach theme only occasionally like how it's properly done in Yoshi's Island and Super Mario Galaxy, and then added more diverse locations for the other 90% of the game because the way it stands now, the beach is seriously overkill.  Not to mention all the yucky beach music that makes me sick after a while.  Variety is a key component of the Mario series.  It's pretty sad that the underground platform jumping missions are the high point of the game because jumping on platforms is normally a chore in 3D Mario, having to line up and carefully execute well-timed jumps.  It's awful.  Platform jumping was awful in Super Mario 64 but at least the environments in that game are a tad nicer/more diverse than the overdone beach theme here.  Eventually you arrive to platforms that either disappear or square shaped cube-like rotating platforms that are unique the first time you deal with these, but ultimately adds more to the frustration factor instead of actually being fun or adding anything to the replayability.  The only time these platform missions become somewhat entertaining is when you have to collect 8 red coins with a timer requiring the player to move swiftly.  These are challenging and fun.  Mario has a spray nozzle and a rocket nozzle.  The spray nozzle is a horrible idea because the object is to fill up with water at every available opportunity and spray most of the bosses until they die, which is clearly NOT what makes many of the other games in the Mario series so incredibly fun to play.  Absolutely no way.  Basically you spray bosses until they die while dodging attacks.  Sometimes this is hard when the surrounding danger gets intense, but most of the time it's painfully easy.  The rocket nozzle is slightly improved however, because this allows you to launch into the sky really high and reach the platforms that would otherwise be impossible to reach.  My least favorite part of the game is a 5-way tie.  1- the lifeless, empty and boring levels with hardly any enemies or exciting powerups anywhere.  Trees, beaches, water, tightropes, platforms, rinse and repeat.  For 10-20 hours.  God...  2- the "collect 100 coins to get a shine" missions (the shines are the same thing as the stars found in SM64 and the Galaxy series by the way).  Several of these missions, namely that one God awful watermelon-pushing stage, takes FOREVER to obtain 100 stars.  If thoroughly exploring lifeless environments is supposed to qualify as fun and the reason many Mario fans make such a big deal about open world exploration, count me out.  Collecting these stars means Nintendo is FORCING me to explore these generic and boring environments.  Nooo way.  3- having to go back to the *same exact stages over and over again* to search for/obtain MORE shines.  Where's the darn level variety?!?!?  Maintaining a beach theme is bad enough, but at least make each stage *different* for crying out loud.  Come on Nintendo, Super Mario Sunshine isn't progress- it's a kick in the rear-end.  4- collecting over 200 boring blue coins, many of which can be found by spraying water on these X's located on walls that you will often stumble upon.  The reward for collecting so many of these bland blue coins isn't exciting for the player in the end so expect the highest level of disappointment imaginable.  Collecting blue coins ends up being a needless chore not only because the reward is underwhelming, but because the concept itself is unexceptional.  No real desire or motivation to obtain them.  5- the overworld I guess you can say, where you spend a good chunk of your time throughout the "adventure", is nothing but generic buildings disguised as MORE generic platform jumping with ugly characters everywhere.  How horrendous.  Oh and the storyline?  Mario goes to jail?  Give me a break.  Never *ever* attempt to implement storyline bits in a Mario platformer.  The "princess is kidnapped/kill Bowser" storyline is pretty weak admittedly, but honestly that's *all* we need.  Don't even think about making a story anymore elaborate than that or it will fail, which is why Super Mario Sunshine's story fails so miserably.  I highly recommend skipping this game.	-1
his game is classic awesome. It is easy if you get the 60 basic stars but if you try getting all get ready to start cussing up a storm!!! it gets difficult but still fun!! it has yoshi delfino isle and princess peach!! (no luigi sadly) some other bad characters make an appearance but do not want to spoil it. Such a great game!!! BUY IT!!! plus you can play it on the wii (not Wii u don't ruin your wii u putting this disc in LOL) enjoy	1
This game is load-tastic (aka you spend more time waiting for it to load then you do playing the game.)  But other than that it is o.k. with little gimme's and modes to keep the people into it.  I think it is a pretty good game, but obviously (especially as I said with the loads) there are flaws.  I would rent it first, then if you like it, buy it.	1
The only real negative buzz I heard about this game prior to release was that there were way too many loads and that you would spend more time waiting for screens to load than playing them.  This is somewhat accurate.  Perhaps this is why it came out with a [relatively low] price tag, but negative buzz has not stopped publishers and retailers from charging [more money] before.  Whatever the reason, I am glad that it did.  This is a gaming value that I have not seen in many years.  The ONLY reason I bought it instead of renting it was because of its reasonable price.  The graphics are good, the physics engine excellent, and it is the best damage and collision modeling I have ever seen.  We XBOXers complain when games, such as Halo for example, allow 4 players but do not allow you to add in sims as well.  This game does allow that, but it may be the main reason it takes so much load time.  It would not be so bad if it did not take a long time to load after EVERY game or level.  If you do not complete the objective or just want to replay the same level for fun... you guessed it- another long load time.  It is annoying and a big reason why this reviewer will not give it higher than a 4.  However, once it loads, it is tremendous crash 'em up fun.  There are many different types of gameplay such as Last Man Standing, Hunter, Free for All, etc.  There are stunt venues, race arenas and even high-speed fun in a parking garage.  If you like driving games and you like smashing into other cars and taking some serious lumps yourself, then this game is for you- especially at [the price].	1
Super Mario Sunshine is a really fun Mario game. This game is great. The controls are simply perfect and you have full control over Mario. FLUDD is a blast to use, and sometimes you even need to use Yoshi. This game is really cute and is filled with fun and sometimes challenging levels.	1
I bought this as  a gift along with a Gamecube controller and a memory card to use on a Wii. The graphic look great on the big screen using the Wii. It is really addicting.	1
I have to say, there was a time when I would have only given this game a two star rating. I always thought there should be more classic enemies here and some of the levels were frustrating at best. But after finding a good price on a used copy I decided to give Mario Sunshine another go, and I'm glad I did. I don't know if my admittidly limited gaming skills have gone up a notch or what, but I finaly beat this thing. (As in defeated the last boss, not collected all the shines.) Mario's new moves are simple to learn and quickly become second nature. The new scenery is actually a breath of fresh air after playing both Mario Galaxies back to back, (both amazing games by the way) and as far as the lack of goombas and troopas, I get it now. This is a distant island, far separated from the Mushroom Kingdom and its occupants. And the game itself looks great, despite being over a decade old. Also consider all the new elements added to the Mario Mythos in this game. Bowser Jr. comes to mind. Petey Pirahna. Toadsworth. It's not perfect, however. I've never liked that you have to beat (never mind reach!) all the Shadow Mario levels to reach the final boss. Mario 64 & Galaxy are more forgiving, letting you progress with enough stars. Bowsers voice is almost unforgivable. And where is Luigi? After the events of Luigi's Mansion, it's the younger Mario Bro who needs a vacation! Still, the gameplay itself excuses these flaws. If it's been a while since your last trip to Isle Delphino, I recomend booking a flight soon. Your second visit may come as a pleasant surprise.	1
I've had a GameCube ever since I was a little kid (now in college), and Super Mario Sunshine was one of the first games I ever bought.  After years of playing it, it's still one of my all-time favorite games.  The gameplay is very good, the graphics are quite good for its time, and the fun factor is definitely there.  If you like Mario, action and adventure games, and a decent storyline, I can't imagine you'd be anything but happy with this game.  There's also numerous guides and walkthroughs available if you ever get stuck or want to learn more about certain areas.  I'd recommend this game to everyone, because whether you're young or old, you'll love it.	1
I remember my first play through this game, it never gets old. A really light hearted change to the usual premise if platform games. A definite must have. Shipping came 3 days EARLY!	1
I was very, very happy to be able to purchase this game for the game cube, Nintendo game player.  It was new as stated which is why I was happy to spend a little extra money for the game.  Thank you so much.	1
I LOVE MARIO  haha ppl this game is very funn teachs kids graffiti is bad as welll. should give it a try :)	1
I don't know how they do it, but they can make 50 Mario games and keep 'em all interesting.  Classic Mario gameplay with plenty of "New" stuff to be interesting.	1
This is a cool game with a lot of adventures and levels to choose from. highly recomend it to everyone!	1
I got this game when I was a kid and I loved it too death. The number one reason why because it was DIFFERENT than other Mario games.   Mario, Princess Peach and Toadsworth decide to go on a vacation in Isle Delfino. When they get to the airport they see a horrible ugly creature that looks like it's made out of goo. Toadsworth ask Mario to look around for assistance and that's when Mario encounters FLUDD (Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device), he helps Mario defeat the monster and when police arrive they arrest Mario. He's being accuse of dirtying the whole isle with paint graffiti and creating monsters tht have been wreaking havoc in their home. So as punishment Mario has to clean the whole isle. After Mario defeats another monster that appeared at the town square, the real criminal appears and he looks exactly like Mario (unless Mario was painted in a transparent blue color). The criminal kidnaps Peach and Mario follows him. Then we find out the one personating as Mario is Bowser's son Bowser Jr. The boy says his father has told him stories about how much Mario is a bad man and has kidnapped Junior's mother Peach away from him. So after Junior takes Peach away, it's up to Mario to fix Junior's mess and save Peach.   The game was really fun, especially the bosses. There were always creative ways to use FLUDD to destroy enemies and such. I wish I could play this game again.	1
This game is awesome. In my opinion, it is the greatest video game in history. It is nice and challenging, and the levels are very fun. The addition of F.L.U.D.D makes it even more unique and fun. I highly reccomend this game to anyone.	1
"Super Mario Sunshine" is a fun game with some things that make it a big different from typical "Mario" games.  But, first, the story.  In this game, Mario and Princess Peach go to the sunny Isle Delfino for a vacation, but there's trouble.  A mysterious man that looks like Mario is making messes all over the island in the form of graffiti and this weird goo.  And the Shine Sprites are missing.  Mario is blamed for the trouble, due to being mistaken for the strange man, and is told the clean up the island.  (And you guessed it.  Peach is kidnapped again at some point.)  Luckily, Mario has FLUDD.  This device can spray water, and so is great for cleaning up the island.  And not only that, but FLUDD has a hover nozzle, too, that helps Mario jump a lot better.  There are two other nozzles that you can get later, as well, though one of them doesn't usually seem to be very useful.  I absolutely love FLUDD.  I love the hover nozzle, which lets you control your jumps much better.  I've never been good at jumping with Mario, and FLUDD makes it so much easier and helps me to enjoy the game more.  It's nice not dying as much anymore because of slightly bad timing in jumps.  The game is also quite fun, with a nice variety of things to do.  Each world has a good amount of Shine Sprites that you can get.  Eight are in different episodes.  Two are secret.  One is from 100 coins.  You get the Shine Sprites by doing different things, like collecting red coins, defeating bosses, climbing places.  Yoshi shows up a few times to help you in the game, as well.  Plus, the central location of Delfino Plaza has a good amount of Shine Sprites to find, as well.  And if you prefer to do a bit more traditional platforming, there are these levels where you must cross all these platforms without FLUDD, which can be quite difficult.  The game is actually quite challenging, which is usually nice, except when it's a bit too hard and frustrating, but nothing in the game is impossible if you try enough times.  Something worth mentioning is that, as you likely can guess, all the levels in this game are island-themed.  A harbor.  A sandy beach.  An amusement park by the sea.  So there isn't as much variety in this game's levels as other "Mario" games, but at the same time, I really like the island levels.  It's pleasant.  It's like I get the vacation that Mario and Peach planned on.  The game also has very nice graphics and nice island-themed music.  So overall, this game is a lot of fun, and I definitely recommend it.  It's different from other "Mario" games because of the goo cleaning and FLUDD and the purely island-themed levels, and I think they're nice changes.  And the game is a challenge, too, and will keep you busy for a while, which I also like.  The only problem I have is that I wasn't a fan of the story that much, but stories never have been that great in "Mario" games.  The important thing is that this game is fun, and it certainly is.	1
This is a really fun and classic game that I love and enjoy very much I bought this game at a used store for $9.00. It was dirt cheap and this game is getting harder to find as with other titles including Zelda games for Gamecube I love this system a lot. This game is really cool and it has awesome graphics and is one of the #1 games I absolutely recommend. I've played a good share of Mario games and they are sweet this one is another one of those awesome games I really love.	1
Most of Mario's games follow the same pattern. Bowser kidnaps poor Princess Peach, and then you collect stars until you've got enough to get to the final level. It's not I don't like that formula, but Mario Sunshine put such a unique twist on it. The game opens with Mario, Peach, and a bunch of Toads flying to a tropical island. A tour guide video comes on and IN FULL VOICEOVER says "Welcome to the sun drenched tropical paradise of Isle Delfino! We are pleased to welcome you to our beautiful home!" Once Mario lands it turns out that Bowser's son put on a Mario disquise and covered the island in pollution. The real Mario gets thrown in jail and is tasked with cleaning up the island. I liked the intro way better then "Dear Mario, I baked a cake for you". The gameplay was just as different as the opening. It still had the open world style that Mario 64 had, but it was often more focused. Normally you spray all of the gunk in your path with your handy dandy water hose, but a lot of the levels also had more puzzle elements. To knock over the giant Wiggler caterpillar you had to spray these weeds that shot a patch of land into the sky. Some levels had a platforming area where you had to just get to the end of the level. Super Mario Sunshine has a ton of variety with a beautiful beach theme. It was a nice change of pace. If you want an innovative Mario 64 sequel though, get Super Mario Galaxy. Super Mario Sunshine is a completely different idea, but it is a very fun game.	1
During the early '70s, Bruce Lee was known as one of the greatest action heroes in history and the master of Jeet Kune Do. The violence that Lee displays in his movies are so extreme, so grosteque, that even todays action heroes wouldn't even dare to perform that kind of stuff. Even if someone tries to emulate his violence, it wouldn't be as good looking as Bruce Lee's original violent performances. Even if he died a tragic death in '73, his memories are still alive today. You'll see a whole lot of people with Bruce Lee T-Shirts, cartoon characters trying to be like Bruce Lee, remastered DVDs of Bruce Lee classics, and even some video game characters in a fighting game acting, fighting, and sounding like Bruce Lee. Now it's time to remember Bruce Lee in another way...put him a next-gen video game console with the greatest 3D graphics processor of all time, the XBox ! Enter Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon, the first Bruce Lee title to feature 3D technology and real time combat. And it's the most anticipated action game among an audience of young Bruce Lee fans. Now to describe the game. The graphics are perfect, powered with the XBox's ultimate 3D processor. The 3D models look very superb with no graphical flaws ! The lighting effects, including the flaming fist mode, looks absolutely jaw dropping. And as for the stages, they're huge and good looking ! There are not much flaws on these stages, except for the fact that there's a whole lot of fog and tons of it. But still, this is a graphical powerhouse overall, and the cutscenes rock ! The audio is okay...I guess. The voice actor who did Bruce Lee didn't do that much of bad job. They almost sound identical, but he really needs to work on it more, including that yell that Bruce Lee does (you know...WAAAAATAAAAAHHHH !!!). And some of the other voice actors are rather laughable, but on the plus side, it almost sounds like they're featured in a Kung-Fu movie. So that seems fair ! The music sounds perfectly fit with the traditional Chinese Kung-Fu tunes. And the sound effects are blazing with realistic hitting and grunting. If you listen carefully, it sounds very identical to that of one of the sound effects featured in one of his films. And as for the gameplay, it rocks ! The controls really hit the spot with slick movement and fast control response. The in-game combat will seem a bit clunky to some newcomers, but after playing this a couple of times, you'll really get used to it. And the coolest thing about the gameplay is, when you kill the last enemy, you get a slow motion of your enemy falling down after one fatal blow and you get to use Nunchakus on certain stages. My favorite part of the game ! The only thing that bothers me about the gameplay is the unforgivable camera angles. It keeps on moving everytime you're done duking it out with the last batch of thugs or if you're fighting with one enemy. But still, even with those flaws, I really loved playing this game. Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon is one of my favorite XBox titles among everything else. Many people may not enjoy it, but anyone who still enjoys watching Bruce Lee's films and still looks up to him, will definently like this game ! If you want to see Bruce Lee alive and kicking it...literaly, Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon is the title that Bruce Lee fans should never miss !	1
I can't believe they want $120 for this game but my daughter wanted it since we searched for new Mario games months ago.. I haven't played this game yet but she said it's great	1
Nothing screams "Fun!" like a good 3D Mario game. After Super Mario 64 blew everybody away in 1996, the only direction Nintendo could go for Mario is up. Super Mario Sunshine is proof - Literally, since it was the follow-up to 64. Is it as amazing? Probably not, but I would be lying if I didn't say this is one of the best Gamecube platformers (if not one of the best Mario games) ever!  Super Mario Sunshine basically did what Mario 64 did and boosted everything up in scale. The levels are extremely well-crafted and fun to play around in, the graphics are incredibly colorful and fresh, and the soundtrack is a whole new selection of memorable Mario music! Even better, we now have new toys to play with in the gameplay department - Not only is Yoshi back (albeit with a downgrade), but you also get a FRICKIN' WATER PACK! This thing's name is F.L.U.D.D., and it drastically changes the way you play Sunshine for the better.  You'll be squirting water to wash away graffiti M's, stunning enemies or attacking them, against bosses, wash out goo, etc. It doesn't sound too fun at first, but the result is truly satisfying, especially when you get to run around and shoot, as well as go into second-person view to shoot more precisely on certain occasions. The control is remarkably fluid, as Mario feels as acrobatic as ever. He can even use F.L.U.D.D. to hover in the air with water, leading to fun platforming moments by itself.  When I say the levels are fun and well-crafted, I mean they are FUN AND WELL-CRAFTED. Every bit of these worlds contains memorable set pieces, so you can't get lost, and there's always something unique in various portions! Plus, the places themselves are brand-new to the Mario universe - You'll be fighting ghosts in a hotel, collecting Red Coins at an amusement park, and even ride squids at a harbor!  Pretty much the only thing I have my concerns with is Bowser. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I'm gonna let you off with a warning - Fighting Bowser is not nearly as grand as in any other fight in a previous Mario game. It's rather disappointing, considering how everything else in the game is so great, but it doesn't diminish the fact that this game is an overall everlasting Gamecube treat! If you're a Mario fan, you can't live without this game.	1
This game is extremely disappointing.  I figured the 3D mario games would be good, since he's their flagship character.  This game is terrible compared to 3d platforming excellence like Jak & Daxter or Sly Cooper.  Considering how much precision the game requires, the lack of practical precision the game gives you in the controls is infuriating (more on that later).  The camera is awful, constantly having to be managed by you to get anywhere, and it DOES NOT SEE THROUGH WALLS.  I cannot believe how pissed the camera made me, giving me a fullscreen of wall during times requiring precision.  Oh, and the "B" button is both the talk and dive button, so if you were trying to talk to someone, but the talk context icon didn't pop-up quick enough, prepare to enjoy flinging yourself off cliffs.  Mario also does not respond well to surfaces he can wall jump or slide on;  If you hit the wall too smoothly for example, he won't wall-slide down it, he'll simply fall straight down as if there's no wall at all.  If you are falling downwards, it's extremely difficult to fall only a little bit forward, you often wind up overshooting your mark because the controls don't allow for fine movement unless you move the joystick at .1 mm at a time.  When you are dealing with disappering blocks, you don't have time for that kind of fine movement, but anything more than that ultrafine joystick movement sends mario running too far.  The game also almost never tells you what you are supposed to do next, nor does it give any hints.  I've had to consult a FAQ many times simply because I didn't understand what I had to do next in a mission, or even where I had to go to get to the next "world".  The most important jump in the game, the 180 degree high jump, also does not reliably work.  If you are moving in one direction, your jump height is actually kind of small.  In order to get decent air, you have to move in one direction for a half second, and then do a 180 and move the other direction and press jump.  Problem is, this jump does not reliably happen.  It works most of the time, but again it is extremely frustrating when it doesn't work at key moments, and you wind up doing a crappy normal jump instead.  Another, more minor quibble is that there is no option to invert/un-invert the camera y-axis or x-axis.  Nintendo chose to make the camera inverted, and you're stuck with it.  I got used to it after 2 hours, but man was it annoying.  How hard is it to program camera inversion???  This game has disgusted me so much that I've lost any interest in picking up the Mario Galaxy games, since they are 3D mario platformers as well.  I'm not going anywhere near this 3D mario garbage again.	-1
When I first saw the screenshots of this Mario, I freaked out thinking "What the crap is Nintendo thinking? Mario with a hydro jet-pack?! Getouttahere!" But, since I'm a huge Nintendo addict and buy everything Mario (besides the Super Mario Bros. live action movie), I ended up reserving it for a cool Nintendo PC disc with a bunch of awesome Mario things and getting the game. I was really stoked the more I read about this game. When I actually started playing the game, I discovered it was a nice add-on to the Mario series... but I'd still prefer the classic jumping plumber over a weird water pack that helps you fly/rocket/etc.  The story is a bit different from the other Mario adventures. You are going on vacation and a graffiti punk begins to tag the resort with groovy colors. You're adventure takes you on a rid... a rid of washing paint of everything in sight! Now, I bet you're thinking "What in the..." but it's a fun, great Mario game. Still, I feel for you. The premier of a Gamecube Super Mario game should have been Mario in Mushroom Kingdom jumping on Goombas, using Yoshi to eat things, running from football turtles, and beating up on some Koopa kids. But, not here, although `someone' does make an appearance for you to beat the mess out of.  Graphically, this is a good looking game. Mario looks like he should in the 3D world with loads of polygons, loads of animations, and his classic red/blue apparel. Every other character you encounter looks really good too. The basic bosses are well done and that's where the classic Mario shows in the game. For instance, in one area, you fight a giant parana plant, who is really well done (really, really well done). The maps are really well thought out and look amazing. There's an instance where you have to battle on a roller coaster. The game never lags so everything on this ride of how the visuals showcase are in full proportion and really fast.  The game supports Dolby Digital surround sound. Mario + Surround = Awesomeness!! There's a few scenes where they actually did some good voice acting, staring Princess Peach, Toad, and Mario. I really have no complaint about the music at all. As for controls, this game is easy. The only time the game gets hard is the time they take the jet-pack off and you have to navigate some weird jumping puzzles. The reason it's hard is because you're used to the relaxing jet-pack and loose your ability to jump around. Intentional? I don't really know but those puzzles are really dang hard. Camera is the same. The camera is almost perfect in most areas (although some levels the camera is the thing that kills you).  There is some replay value to the game since you get to unlock an alternative costume, a more beach styled costume, to play through the second time. The game is well done so you may want to run through it again, just not right after you finish it.  Overall, I say get this game. It's probably $20 right now and well worth the money. I have never really disliked the game itself, just the fact that Nintendo hasn't released a classic Mario game for the Gamecube. The game though is well done and very fun. Also, in today's high-def age, the game still fairs well overall in the graphics/sounds category. Just don't expect the grass to move.	1
My nephew loves this game. He's 16. Other reviews just insult Bruce Lee and that makes me feel bad. Those people that insulted Bruce Lee and his family are mindless. He is a great person. When I heard about his death I just felt shocked. I went to his funeral in Hong Kong before they took him to Seattle. He died of a thin vessel in his brain. His friend suggested a pill. He went to the hospital. His blood vessel started leaking when he took a nap. Then, he died. I'll start talking about the game. Whenever my nephew comes home from school, he plays this game for hours. He always says, "Go Bruce Lee!" and "Beat em' up Bruce!" And I, well, I play it myself too. It is fun though. If you think this is boring, go to YouTube and type in Bruce Lee: Quest of the dragon.	1
I cannot understand how any other reviewers on Amazon could give this game any better than 1 star. You see, I used to be of the mind that every video game, no matter how bad, had at least one redeeming quality. Sure, Tenchu was slow and poorly animated, but it had neat backgrounds and was it occasionally (unintentionally) hilarious. And on I Ninja, the "beat the clock" missions sucked, but the "kill everyone" missions more than made up for it. Then I played this game. There was nothing redeeming about it. Nothing.  In fact, the only good thing about the game, an unlockable mode in which you fight solely against the game's bosses, mysterious disappeared shortly after I found it. The only other good thing about this game was the off button. (This was, of course, voted one of the top 3 worst games of all time on...some show.)  But what was bad about the game? Well, your enemies suck. They range from brainless idiots to masters of the martial arts. And sometimes, they change from one to the other on a whim. They all look the same. All the ninjas have the same outfit; it just changes color (blue for boys, red for girls). And there is the witty banter they assault you with, which ranges from, "Let's teach him a lesson," to "I think I'm in love."  Bruce himself is pretty messed up. When he's fighting, he sounds like a chicken. When he's not, he sounds nothing like Bruce Lee. He also has the extremely useless and life threatening ability to lock on to a specific enemy from a horde of many. This allows him to block that specific enemy, while all the rest of them sneak up behind him and kick his butt. Hard. By the way, the block button was X. X is not a block button. X is an attack button. They couldn't even get that right.  I guess in an effort to show how much Bruce Lee looks like himself, the design team inflated his head a bit to make it stand out. That was kind of silly, but then again, so was the fact that Bruce changes his outfit every chance he gets. And not just from level to level. I mean when he starts chasing a ninja chick through pouring rain, he is wearing a Chinese style coat. But when he catches her he's shirtless. Then, the coat's back on. Where did he stick it, down his pants?  I've got to admit, I never liked Bruce Lee. I thought Enter the Dragon was boring. So I hoped that this video game would allow me to look at Bruce with a whole new light. It did. I am now even less in Bruce Lee's corner.	-1
Wowza! This Is One Of The Best Mario Games Of Them All! As Far As The Setting, Music And Overall Strategy Goes, This Game Is More Like Super Mario Bros Then Mario Party. By That I Mean That Sunshine Is A More "Grown Up" Mario Game Then The "Kiddie" Mario Party Games. Oh And Did A Say How Hard It Is???? This Is Way To Hard For Most Kids Under 10. Im 14 And I Have No Idea How To Get To The Next Level Sometimes, Even My 35 Year Old Sister Cant Beat It. And We've Been Playing It For A Few Years Now! Its Simple At First, But It Gets Difficult Fast. But Never Mind That. This Is Still A Great Game Overall. It Even Looks Realistic. Good CGI. Its A "Deep" Game Too. Lots Of Exploring. You Have To Check Every Little Nook And Cranny For Very Cleverly Hidden Things. Very Fun Tho. 4 Stars Easy.	1
Man! I love this game so much! when i finally got this game it was as awesome as ever! hard to play still but i got more better at it over time.  very tropical feel to it.	1
Super Mario Sunshine is a black sheep, an odd duck, a quirky gemstome. SMS is one of those games that takes an incredibly successful formula from Super Mario 64 and makes just enough weird tweaks that it feels like a game that is amazing, but in an odd place placed next to its predecessor and successor in 3-D Mario lore.  The story is the first strange difference. No longer is Peach the helpless damsel in distress that spurns Mario's quest. Sure, she gets kidnapped a few times throughout. However, this game is about Mario's vacation ruined by an evil doppelganger who has become a vandalizing, littering fiend on Isle Delfino. When Mario arrives, he embarks on a subsequent adventure to clear his name while restoring sunshine to his tropical island vacation destination. Sounds bizarre, doesn't it? Yeah, it is, but for some reason it works! I enjoyed it quite a bit and some familiar elements do come into play, but even those are employed in unexpected ways. It made the story aspect of the game a little more interesting than the run-of-the mill Bowser-kidnapping-Peach Mario story we're all used to (not-really-a-spoiler-but-kind-of: it does go in that general direction eventually). Granted, story is not the most prominent theme in any Mario game, obviously. However, this one is compelling enough, and pretty clever.  Because of the tropical vacation premise, Mario's adventure is entirely confined to Isle Delfino itself. OUT are the magical portal paintings of various settings, like in Mario 64. IN are very diversified levels, but all of which sport some sort of Tropical Island motif. Again, this is NOT a bad thing, and I have tremendous nostalgia for all of the levels of Super Mario Sunshine! From a family vacation theme-park,  to a bustling and charming seaside port, to a magical cove filled with native citizens with seashells for clothes and massive shells for homes, plus MANY more, EVERY level is incredibly unique, memorable, and FUN! Even after all these years, I still goosh over the ridiculously killer level design and unique challenges to get the sunshine.  The gameplay is another thing Sunshine does different. Sure, the super intuitive, responsive acrobatic controls are all still in Mario's repertoire; but there is a huge wrinkle in the gameplay in the form of the FLUDD canon, a backpack water pump that Mario uses to clean the goop and grafiti that "Shadow Mario" left in his mischievous wake. The FLUDD's mechanics are easy to grasp and it is a BLAST to use! It is always surprising and awesome, how the FLUDD comes into play when solving the game's numerous puzzles, boss fights, and anything else you can think of! The Starshine bits to collect all have unique challenges that are always fun, and quite varied. This game really does build on the brilliant ideas first created in Mario 64, and later continued in Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2. Even Yoshi makes an appearance or two, but he is the only thing not implemented very well.  The graphics are all amazing, in that immediately distinguishable, stylized Mario sort of way. The different levels are all unique and colorful, and the animations are great! The sound effects are top notch and, as in any Mario game, the music is catchy, memorable, and excellent. I have no complaints in these regards.  Super Mario Sunshine is a special game I hold near and dear to my heart. Many people dissed it when it first came out, but I gave it a fair shot, and was NOT disappointed. Even all these years after, Sunshine is a game that captures the heart of the 12-year-old that played it way back when, and the heart of the 20-year-old gamer who loves great games, period. Even now, I would recommend buying this fantastic 3-D Mario black sheep, and enjoy it even amongst the current generation bests. It does so many things differently than you'd expect from Mario, but it does them as masterfully as any mainstay element of the classic Mario games, and feels just as special as a result. Buy it, play it, LOVE IT!	1
Through the generosity and thoughtfulness of a cousin, my son was given said cousin's Nintendo GameCube and a large collection of games (nothing better than free :).  My son was ecstatic and has been playing them (when he is allowed) for the last 4 months.  He has been asking for a Wii for the last 2 years, but as Santa has fallen on tough times in those last 2 years, he has not received one (I've heard through the grapevine that Santa is bringing him a Wii, albeit a used one from Gamestop, for Christmas this year. Santa couldn't pass up the $99 price and 1 year replacement guarantee on it. :)  The GameCube has served as a terrific substitute, and Super Mario Sunshine has been the latest obsession for the last 2 weeks.  His cousin gave him several other Mario Bros. games, but he says Sunshine "is probably his favorite."  Luckily, he will still be able to enjoy it, as well as the other GameCube games even when Santa brings the Wii.  The GameCube will go in his bedroom, and the Wii will be downstairs in the living room (after all, I will want to use it too since I plan on getting the Wii Fit, as well as playing the Wii Sports games).  Since GameCube games can be played on the Wii, my son will have his choice (as long as I don't want to watch something on TV) of where he can play.	1
Even though I've had Mario Galaxy for a while now, I have held off on playing it because I had yet to play Super Mario Sunshine. Of course, the stories in either are not connected in anyway, but it was a matter of principle. I wanted to make note of how much Nintendo had advanced the Mario formula and I had always heard that Sunshine was a worthy Mario entry.  I'm pleased to write that what I heard was true. Though it seemed Sunshine was overlooked due to the new water pack element, it still deserves to be played by any Mario fan. If you are looking for a fun and challenging experience, Mario Sunshine is the game for you.  The story is interesting enough to keep you playing. Mario, Peach and some Toads go off to a tropical island for a relaxing vacation. Of course, this is interrupted when Mario get's arrested and has to do community service for vandalizing property. Or so it seems. It turns out to be an impostor who is obsessed with framing Mario. I won't spoil any other details, but this is the first traditional Mario game that tried to have a story, at least.  The basis of the game is to clean up polluted areas with the water pack you are given. Upon successful cleaning, you receive a star sprite which is needed to restore the light to the island. The water pack is fun to use and it adds to the jumping gameplay. You can use to to hover across long gaps, or, if you find the right nozzle, you can rocket jump into the sky. There is also a jet nozzle for racing across the water and your standard nozzle allows you to spray objects with a stream of water. The water pack does a great job of complimenting the otherwise solid gameplay.  The challenge comes in trying to collect all 120 star sprites. Of course, you can complete the game with around 75, I believe. But getting those 75 was is no walk in the park. There are certain levels that will really test your platform jumping skills and patience. I was close to breaking a controller in frustration at a few of these, but as they have become rather expensive over the years, I just chose to punch a pillow instead. As a fair warning, the levels I'm referring to are the ones in which you temporarily lose your water pack. These levels will strike a cord with NES Mario fans as the difficult resembles those days. Even the music is a nod to Mario's beginnings. Good luck with those!  Overall, Sunshine is a another great entry into the long running Mario franchise. It has a lot of stars to collect, challenging segments and most of all, it's just fun to spend time with the world's most famous plumber.	1
This game is to my 6 year old nephew what the original Mario was to me. Magical, amazing, breathtaking and worth every dollar.  This game is an instant classic, I can see him when he's my age and thinking back on his first video games. This one will always bring a smile to his face.  I got this through a secondary seller through amazon known as Penny Pinchers. I give them 5 out of 5 stars on their service because it was fast and the disc was in great condition. The packaging however had me cracking up. They had the game in a zip lock baggy with two sections of blue moon beer crate cardboard secured around it with tape. Also the mailing envelope was super strong and I doubt a rocket launcher could put a dent in the thing. I managed to save around 5-7 dollars by buying from amazon instead of buying this from a nearby gamestop.  Next on the list is, Mario Kart Double Dash. Now only if it didn't cost $100+ dollars on amazon... (whats up with that?)	1
Super Mario 64 was one of the best 3D Platformers ever made so Super Mario Sunshine has high expectations. But does it fulfill them. Yes and no. Let's start off with the story.  Mario goes on vacation and decides to go to a tropical island called Isle Delfino. But before he gets there an imposter named Shadow Mario has been spoiling the island which makes the Shine Sprites flee the island leaving the island's residents in darkness. So now Mario has to clean up the island to restore his reputation.  The game play is well done. Your goal is to collect 120 Shine Sprites in different areas on the island but there are only nine areas on the island to go to which is a little disappointing. I love getting to go to tons of different worlds which I had the pleasure to do in Super Mario 64. Also Through almost the entire game you can never take off your FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device) device. I'm not saying its bad I just think it would be nice to take a break from it once in a while. The levels can be a blast, there's a nice variety of Shine Sprites to get. For some you need to climb up windmills, surf on Bloopers, collect coins (ten blue coins give you a Shine Sprite) and well... I could go on and on and on.  The graphics are wonderful and are a big improvement over Super Mario 64's. The water looks terrific and I love being on Sirena Beach with the beautiful sunset.  The controls work almost flawlessly and there very easy to learn and hard to forget.  I have another complaint though. I HATE how lifeless the cut scenes are. Mario's face is blank all the time and it takes away from the story. And lots of them are impossible to skip. I mean the end of Mario 64 was so much fun watching and that's on an older console. Also the music isn't nearly as good as Super Mario 64 or any of the other Super Mario adventure games which is really disappointing.  This game is challenging and has great replay value and if you want to get all 120 Shine Sprites you'll probably want a Guide to help you. Overall this game is major fun but just not as high caliber as Super Mario 64 but I definitely recommend it.	1
There are so many things about this game that make it stupid.  Luckily, I only rented it (and returned it the same night *lol*).  I feel sorry for anyone who had to buy it.  This has got to be the most disapointing game ever for the mighty XBOX.  Here's why: 1. The gameplay: it's just uninteresting!  You walk around as Bruce Lee from a side view, A SIDE VIEW.  You kill people with 2 lame moves (punch and kick) and collect the coins that come after they die.  It's so lame and dull, it's LAUGHABLE!  It's way to easy, and beating up the people is so dull.  2 lame moves, and all the bad guys look the same.  You advance and keep collecting coins.  An ametuer gamer could beat this in 1 night!... 2. The graphics = horrible!  Oh my goodness, Bruce Lee looks like a girl in tights (which is such an insult to his memory) and all the villains look exactly the same (red ninjas).  Oh, and the coins that you get our the size of Bruce's head.  The 2 lame moves don't even look real either.  I played this game ad beat 3 levels in 10 minutes.  I basily fell asleep in my chair.  When I woke up, I returned it immediatly! 3. The reputation it tried to take.  I mean, come on: Bruce Lee.  What kind of people created this game; to insult his memory; this game is HORRIBLE!  On the cover, it even went as far as to say it was BETTER than DOA3!  I own DOA3, and it is a hundred million times better than this junk. I hope I've proved to you why u shouldn't buy this game.  It is so... easy to beat and so boring at that.  I'd rather watch grass grow.  There are so many better games to buy for it's price:... If it was about 5 bucks, I might counsider buying it.  But for everything else I can get for that price, I guess I'll have to pass...*lol*	-1
This game has bad everything.  Bad setup (aka you can beat bosses with your eyes closed.)  Bad graphics.  Bad Consistancy (With gameplay and graphics.)  All of that together = a game that is not worth buying.  I am very disapointing, thinking this would actually be good and it amuses me to think I once thought it would be good.	-1
Grafix, on the x-box, mediocre. Story, bland and pointless. Controlls, slow and difficult. Action and play, abysmal terrible boring. Challenge level, not possible without cheating. Results: Shame on whoever disgraced Bruce Lee with this stinker of the year!	-1
See I'm gonna be honest, the controls were not too bad. But the main thing about it is the gameplay/story line. There is not much of a sensible story to the game and you have to BUY MOVES which is really stupid/unreasonable. Also you just keep fighting about 4 chinese guys every 20 feet and then have ONE guy thats suppose to be the boss that looks just like the rest (of the other people) they got different clothes/looks and all that but they all look just like everyday human beeings you see on the street, so it's kinda repetitive. If you LOVE BRUCE LEE this game is worth renting but don't buy plus the levels are not all that interactive!	-1
This game was perfect in every way! while playing the game I was stunned at how well they portyaed Bruce Lee(with the voice, the screaming while he fights, etc).  The fighting was sometimes extremely hard to very easy.  For example you could be kicking @ss and then all of a sudden 8 more bad guys would jump in and then you would be on the ground getting your @ss kicked!!  Everything from the bosses, the talking, scenery, difficulty, fighting, moves,etc is perfect and it would take me a very long time to write it all down.  Even if you still don't want to buy this game, then rent it youll be very glad you did!!	1
This game is a failure on every level.  From the very begginning cinematic sequences you can tell how little of the Xbox's capacity is being used.  The cinematics are worse than some I have seen on the original playstation. And the gameplay?  Ouch!  This game needed a few more months in development to work the bugs out.  Supposedly you can go through and earn new kung fu moves but who cares as you will have to perform them through bad graphics and severe drops in framerate any time there are more than 4 characters on the screen.  Think back to the old 8 bit nintendo games and you will get the idea.  I rented this game, fortunately, because I am a huge fan of Bruce Lee, and I really wanted to like it, but alas, IT Stinks!!! Those who have compared this game to Final Fight should write a letter of apology to the good folks at Capcom.  Final Fight is a much better game despite being 10 yrs older and having a fraction of the system resources available that QOD has.  At least Final Fight had a multiplayer mode and smooth graphics. Do not waste your money on this game!	-1
Super mario sunshine is very enteresting but when u beat it it is not as fun. Yes u can go back and replay the missions but it is not as fun. The purpose of this game is to clear all of the goo off the island and then beat the boss of each level and the more levels u beat the brighter the sky gets. as soon as u beat it the sky is the brightest it gets. This game is very fun but the replay value is not very good. It is not multiplayer either. The controls r good but the water is sometimes hard to use. I like super mario 64 better because it has more places to go to and more things to do after u beat it but these two games r very similar becides the water squirter. The graphics r very good for an old gc game. There is no blockiness it is all curved. Anyway this to me was like the next super mario 64 but for the gc and super mario 64 was my favorite game.	1
super mario sunshine is a classic the best of the best great great game buy it if your a mario fan you won't be sorry	1
This is one of the best mario games i have ever played. The graphics are amazing, the levels are long, and the game its self is long. This game is also diffrent from the regular marios, in this game instead of getting mushrooms and other things like that you have waterguns, It might sound wierd but trust me its very fun. If you are a mario fan or if your just looking to buy a mario game defenatly check this one out.	1
I'm glad to see that people have still been reviewing this game recently.  I'm always a system behind, but I always buy Nintendo.  I just bought a gamecube and this game.  Let me tell you this.  Super Mario Sunshine is one of the most frustrating creations I've ever been invited to partake in.  At times it seems like the game was designed to make me break my controller and buy a new one.  If I hadn't grown up on Mario, and if this were the first video game I'd ever played, I would never want to play another one for the rest of my life.  I concur with everything the other reviewers have said about the controls and the camera.  You're constantly fighting the buttons to get where you already know you need to be.  It's sometimes tedious, often mind numbingly repetitive, and almost always keeping your blood at a steady boil.  That may very well be the genius in the game.  You CAN NOT put this thing down.  It's brilliant, funny, creative, and fun.  It's also evil, sadistic, and more than willing to make you spend 3 hours on a level that will take you 3 minutes to complete in the long run.  I don't know how a game for children ended up this difficult, but I begrudgingly give it 4 stars.  It's completely brilliant, and it's also the most frustrating game I've ever played in my life.  What can ya do?	1
I do not understand anyone who would rate this game badly.  This game enthralled me for hours.  It was so much fun, that I have played it through two times.  The graphics are not as good as Galaxy, of course, but I thought that from the neat worlds down to the music was fantastic.  Some of the stars were difficult and frustrating, but I think they were better planned out than the simpler ones found in Galaxy, though Galaxy did have a few hard ones to.  This game took me longer than Galaxy, about the same amount of time it took me to beat Mario 64.  Galaxy was good, Mario 64 was better, Sunshine was the best.  (Don't get me wrong, Galaxy was a lot of fun, but not tops on my list.)  It was a lot of fun defending a hotel from a manta ray attack and running along the rooftops of Delfino Plaza, I highly recommend this game.	1
"Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon" is a horrific game, that is even worse than many old 2D street fighting games like the "Bare Knuckle" series. There is probably only handful of combos you can pull off, and they all [stink]. Also, the voice acting and overall audio in the game is terrible; for example, one of the mini-bosses that one will encounter in the game, will say: "You are dead" in such a monotone manner that you probably will die in your seat from disgust. Taunting like that happens throughout the whole game, which is possible to beat in as little as 5 short hours. Additionally, the game's visuals are horrible too, even though there are some Xbox-specific graphical features, the game runs extremely choppy. The biggest problem is the loading time, which adds up to the choppiness and makes it even worse. First, when the level is picked, it will take like a minute or even more to load. Then, there will be loads after every time the player advances to a new scene in the same level. And finally, there will be yet another load when the player quits to the main menu. Thank God, that I did not buy this game. I hope nobody else does so either. All I can say, if you don't believe me on how bad it is, rent it, and I am sure you will understand and bring it back on the very next day...	-1
THE BEST GAME OF 2002 AND I GOT REVIEW 629.  THIS GAME IS AWSOME I STILL LOVE IT AFTER I HAD IT FOR 4 YEARS.  IT IS ALSO THE BEST GAME FOR THE GAMECUBE BESIDES SUPER SMASH BROS.MELEE. THIS GAME IS THE DEBUT OF BOWSER JR. AND F.L.O.O.D. .  F.L.O.O.D. IS A WATER THING BEHIND MARIOS BACK THAT SPRAYS WATER IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO CLEAN UP DEFLINO PLAZA BECAUSE THE CLONE MARIO [WHICH IS BOWSER JR.] MESSES IT WITH SLIME AND YOU HAVE TO VS. SLIME MONSTERS	1
This game has been picked on for so long that I just HAD to step in and defend it! This was the first big Mario adventure since Super Mario 64, and I thought that it delivered everything that it should have and more! I had such a wonderful time playing this game. Spraying the jetpack, riding Yoshi, collecting coins and shine sprites etc. And that cool, tropical music...ahh! Everyone keeps saying that this wasn't as good as Super Mario 64, but I thought it was way better! Super Mario 64 didn't even have Yoshi, except as a brief cameo appearence on top of Peach's castle. No, Yoshi isn't the only reason I think Sunshine is better than Mario 64, it's just ONE of the reasons. Spraying all the goo off of thing's with the FLUDD jetpack is much funner than it sounds! And this game also gave Mario's arch enemy Bowser a voice for the first time ever! And Peach? What can I say, she's as cute as alway's. I guess that's why Bowser keeps kidnapping her again and again! ^,^  The bottom line is, don't let anyone tell you that this game sucks, because it's totally awesome! If you missed out on this game, then you missed out on a HUGE moment in the Super Mario Series! It will alway's remain a classic.	1
When the first Mario game came out for the NES, your goal was to rescue the princess from bowser--an evil, fire-breathing turtle/dragon boss.  A little more than a decade later, and Mario is running around watering plants and hosing off sidewalks.  What the heck happened?  In all seriousness, this game is extremely disappointing.  The graphics in this game are almost no improvement over its N64 predecessor, and the controls are sloppier and more frustrating (the water pump controls are very awkward and take a lot of getting used to.)  On top of that, the camera behavior has become even more irritating than before.  It's not uncommon for the camera to swing around behind a wall and make it difficult to see what the heck you're doing.  You'll find yourself adjusting the camera very often, which isn't exactly my idea of fun.  The overall look and feel of the game is strange.  Many of the levels look basically the same, the enemies lack creativity, and the music is just bad.  On the plus side, the game does have its moments.  Some of the bosses are fun... that's pretty much it.  If you are a big fan of the Mario games, I'd get this just because it's cheap and is a good back-up game for when you get tired of the really good ones (like Super Smash Bros. Melee.)  However, if you're expecting this to be a step above and beyond Super Mario 64, you're in for a disappointment.	-1
I remember reading about this game that was in progress when Mario 64 was released and sure enough this game was it. I think that at times this game can be very fun..ONCE YOU START PROGRESSING. It can be very rough at times. YES! I admit using my handy dandy game guide to get me through but even with a game guide you still get so confused. It gets confusing when certain cut scences that were suppose to happening after a certain amount of stars happens later on in the game or you just so happen to run in section were something takes place. I can not stress enough how the graphics in this game are so prestine and real I love it! I think once I get use to everything will I understand more but I will rate this game 4 stars.	1
when i got his game, i was simply disapoited.this doesn't seem like one of those memorable mario games that you could pick up,play, and have a good time.for those you that are expecting super mario 64, don't get it. I'm not putting it down, I mean it's a great game, but, it doesn't have the mario feel.	1
Super Mario Sunshine was one of the launch titles originally included with the Nintendo Gamecube, and represents the hallmark name in the Nintendo lineup.  Mario is back armed with "FLUDD," a backpack device that spews water to knock out enemies, help Mario hover, rocket you around the screen, or even propel you sky high.  It's a versatile tool that's lots of fun to play around with.  The graphics (particularly the water effects) in this game are outstanding.  Water ripples as it should, splashes just right, and never ceases to amaze.  The colors are vibrant and exciting, and there is no lack of eye candy in the game.  By the same token, sound is good.  Voice acting is hardly standard in Mario games, but you get several scenes of it here.  The rest of the talking is gobbledy-gook accompanied by on screen text, but it is still well presented.  Music is atmospheric and hardly epic, but it serves the purpose.  Game play is also diversified from other offerings with a full arsenal of moves at Mario's disposal.  He can bound off walls, balance on a tightrope, and climb cages (in addition to the aforementioned FLUDD moves).  It's fun just to run and jump around levels with Mario trying out moves.  So why knock the game down?  Well, to start with, the camera.  As you run up against walls and obsticles, the camera all too often gets trapped behind a wall, or cannot rotate where you want because of something in the way.  So it becomes a chore at times to get your view pointed where you want.  Also, there is a high frustration factor here.  I appreciate difficulty, but when a 20 minute trek inching your way to the top of a structure is nullified by a slight misstep that finds you back at the bottom of the level, it goes from hard to just annoying.  Finally, I found there to be a slight lack of variety in levels.  Although the levels are beautiful as I said, there are not many, and you simply play them 8-10 times over with only slight variations for different challenges.  All in all, this is still a good game, and I recommend it for a GameCube collection.  If nothing else, it's Mario for crying out loud!  But it is not a game without flaws, and you should take note of them so you know what you're getting into!  At the current price ($20), it's worth it, though.	1
In Super Mario Sunshine, Mario is impersonated by a fiendish fellow wielding a paintbrush that spreads obnoxious goo all over the beautiful island.  Mario is charged with cleaning it up, figuring out who the culprit is, and restoring the island's "shine sprites," which have disappeared.  Of course, there is also some Princess-saving involved.  The object of this game is collect "shines" by completing various tasks, or finding where they're hidden. There are lots and lots of secrets to discover and gadgets to use, which goes a long way toward keeping one entertained.  The game is quite pretty, the environments are detailed and rich, and the maps are large and satisfying.  The amount of freedom allowed the player in this game is fantastic. Each section of the map has several "episodes" which you can revisit to find more treats and secrets.  There are a few temporary limitations that keep you from jumping ahead of what you're capable of, but by in large, you've got the freedom to go wherever you choose.  This game comes highly recommended.	1
After escaping from the clutches of 'King Boo' in LUIGI'S MANSION, Mario decides to treat himself to relaxing vacation on the beautiful 'Isle Delfino'. However, when he arrives, he is blamed for coating this rich land scape in a thick, greay sludge.  Fortunately, he finds a talking machine called FLUDD to help him clean this once gorgous island.  As in the timeless classic SUPER MARIO 64, you have to unlock a number of 'alternate worlds' to beat the game. You can spend hours exploring the lush enviorments of each world, which are full of rollercoasters, tightropes, trampolines, and giant coral reefs. Mario's moves are almost unlimited: he can swim, surf, ride Yoshi (YEAH!), fight enimies (they range from mechanical Bowseres to giant squids), climb trees...and thats hardly a start. The first few levels are a little boring (they involve cleaning polloution...UGH) but the game's true charms do not become apparent until a bit later. Be patient with it, and you will be rewarded.  Overall, SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE is a gem of a game that would make an excellent addition to all GC libraries. ENJOY THE RIDE!!	1
This game has beautiful colors, and the story, is great, and is very fun.  But, it's very hard!!! You have to find 120 shine sprites to finish the game, and to find them is not an easy task!! You have to find every world, and to pass it, it gets your nerves cuz, every time u lose u start all over again!!	1
I have had time to sit down with the game and focus on playing it.  I do really enjoy playing the Game. You can still get very frusterated with the game, and some things in the Game are hard to do; and hard to get. It is challenging. But I have gotton better at the game; and now I can quickly get many Shine Sprites. (It does take a while to get used to it) And it is a Mario game; which is a HUGE plus. Mario games always did (and this one is and has never been no exception) take you out of the real world and immerse you in the land of Mario. I'm not far enough yet to have all the games features like yoshi's and stuff; but I will continue to play it, even if do get frusterated at times. It also took me a while to get into this game; but it has grown on me quite a bit.  Not a bad game actually; and it is worth the money.. just don't make the mistake I did by giving up on it so early on; it grows on you and becomes easier, but it is still very challenging and sometimes frusterating. At least it is not a game you can whip through in a week. I would love to rate this game with 5 starts just for it being a Mario game, that is fun and interactive.. but I do need to take in account all my feelings about the game. So overall a strong 4.	1
I got a Gamecube about 3 months ago and I bought a lot of games to play I was so excited and this game was the first I picked out to play. I've been playing this game ever since I got it. It is so much fun but alittle hard. It does have a good storyline (strange) but good. It is very difficult to find all the shine sprites and sometimes when you do find them it's hard to figure out how to get them. There is alot of gameplay in this game. I had to get the official strategy's guide for this game though. But this game is awesome when you finally get past certain parts of the game. I'm still working on it when I have time. It would be great for kids as well but adults might have to help them out abit. Depending on there age. This game is one of the best mario games to play. Go buy it it's fun. If you like a challange you'll get one in this game!!!!!!!!!!	1
I absolutely love this game! The fact that you have the option of rocketing around with a water pack completely stuns me. The graphics aren't top notch, but WHO CARES?! The story line is great, but for some of the puzzles, you require a strategy guide. Mario's main goal in the game is to clean up the terribly large graffiti mess left by Shadow Mario. Play through the game as Mario meets new friends, solves puzzles, and returns the Shine Sprites to their rightful place at the Shine Gate!	1
Yes it is for kids .. and adults.  THis is a great game for everyone.  There is tons of fun and colorful action.  The best part is it is always creative.  Other companies learning to make a platformer play this game and take notes.  Your games do not have the creative juices flowing through it nearly as much as the big Plumber.  Bottom Line:  Is it fun?  One of the most fun titles on the gamecube.  Will I keep it?  Until I beat it.  Is it for kids?  You bet.	1
wen ifirst bought this game i wasn't evpecting much from it, but when i got home and played it it was awsome and i loved it some of the levels are quite challenging but i love mario and yoshi so umm... yea there awsome and this game seriously kicks some a$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
This game is great and highly recomend it and is a must for collectors.  Little ones will love and enjoy this game, yet memory card is a must.	1
Super Mario Sunshine is not your avarage Bowser steals peach stroy again this time its evil mario dude filles streets with slimy multi-colored goo that he spills all around the city, gets blamed on you must collect shines to clean city and save the day.  It is a great stroy mode game. It is not that challenging of a game but who the hell cares it has some of the best graphics Gamecube has to offer. With tons of bosses you have to fight. To all the shines you have to get Mario sunshine shines its way barley to 5 stars. It is one of the best mario games on Gamecube	1
Those who have played games for a few years now may have realized one thing - games are getting easier. And its not simply due to maturity and being better at finding patterns in games, games are truly getting easier. I don't think that is a good thing to do to games. Infact, the more frusterated I get over a game, the better I feel the game is. Of course there is a limit - too difficult and noone will complete it, but too easy and games get finished in under a week.  This game is fun, don't get me wrong. But those who have played older versons of Mario will realize this is far too easy and short and does not make a good addition to the Super Mario Legacy. if you haven't played this - Play it! But, If you want difficulty or you want to feel more accomplished when you finish a level - go back to perhaps Super Mario64.	-1
I loved the fact they brought out a new Mario game and this time with Yoshi but I must admit I thought Mario could have had a few more moves instead of Jump - Long Jump - Water Spout. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are fantastic and the game is really fun, but a few more moves would have made this game great. The plot is interesting too.	1
This is a fun game. I enjoy going to all the different levels and SPRAYING PEOPLE!!!!!!!!! WOOOO!!!!!!!! This is a fun game.	1
i don't like this game.cleaning up the island is so dumb!  pianta village is too hard!  yoshi melts too much!>:(  also,saving peach gets boring after the millionth time you do it!!!!(she has to get bodyguards...)  don't buy!!  Starfishie"Star"^_~	-1
When Mario arrives on tropical Isle Delfino, the once-pristine island is polluted and plastered with graffiti. Even worse, he's being blamed for the mess! Now instead of enjoying a relaxing vacation, Mario  has to clean up the place and track down the real culprit. I really ike it!	1
Well, what can I say about this game?! It reminds me of Mario 64, but this time around, Mario is running around with a water cannon. It really enjoyed the game when I first bought it, but it does get a little dry after a few hours. I never finished the game because I'm not to much into the Mario adventure games. The graphics are great, and the controls are tight. If you're into this type of genre, then this game will fit you well.	1
this game is a lot of fun either riding on bloopers or chasing shadow mario or finding all 120 shine sprites its extremely fun.  the graphics are really cartoony but pretty good.  in the game you find 8 different places where you must beat there ten missions.youll also have a new freind. He stays on your back and you can you can shoot all the graffiti off the walls and you can hover or boost straight up in the air.yoshis also a load of fun to ride. you can go around for an hour eating bird or disturbing the people by squrting them or bouncing on there heads.overall the game is extremely fun with lots of twists to the mario world.	1
This game has about the same controls as like in mario 64 but this time...Mario''s walking on suuunnnshhhiiinneeee oooooOOOooooo with this new invention he uses to clean an island.	1
This is a favorite game for me to play!  I play sometimes and man I spray the water so good and fast!  Man it all gets the dirt off and they are happy in the towns.  I play one time on the boats, and the man yells you get off! and stop spraying me no more! that man is my favorite part.  My worst favorite part is with Shadow Mario!  You know that he is hard to chase!  tony	1
I just brought this game the other night finally and its a real cool fun game but i do got ways to go of beating it lol  Anyway mario makes his return along with princess peach yoshi and mushroom dudes and lugi is absent from the game ' once mario arrives ' the Delfino police arrest him claming he polluted the island ' now mario must find out who the impostor is  Now this is what i can say is the best mario game along with mario all stars ' Super Mario Sunshine features the adventure field which is Delfino Plaza ; graphics are very colorful and tropical like which makes the game real fun ' but their can be some times when it gets difficult like the mini game levels that are in the game ' they are a real pain and annyoing ' but practice makes perfect  Anyway Buy This Game you won't regret it :)	1
If you like bright, colorful graphics and a story line with a sunny disposition then this is the game for you! Mario makes his return to the Nintendo console in this cheery game which pits Mario against an enemy who looks an awful like Mario himself!  Mario and the Princess are only looking for a little rest and relaxation (and a lot of food in Mario's case), when suddenly after they land on Island Delfino Mario is arrested and put in jail for apparently defiling the beautiful island paradise. But lo and behold Mario hasn't done anything wrong! What's a hero to do? Well, go out and clean up the mess while trying to figure out who has framed him!  The gameplay takes Mario to many different areas of the island all with their own difficulties and obstacles. Mario's goal throughout the game is to find the sunshine sprites which have scattered due to the uncleanliness of the island.  This game provides quite a few hours of fun and enjoyment although there were times when the game ceased to hold my attention due to what I felt were repeats of challenges for Mario. Overall however, a great game and essential one for your Gamecube collection.	1
Many people expected too much from this game. I didn't. I got just what I wanted, and then some.  I can't wait for Mario 128. Graphics-5/5 great graphics and water effects. Play control-4/5 Perhaps the only semi-weak point, at first the control is a bit loose.  But by Gelato Beach, you should have a good feeling for it. Game Design-5/5 120 shines is a lot, and Im still working on it!  The cinema scenes are worthy of getting popcorn and a front row seat for. Satisfaction-6/5, I don't know the amount of replay value it offers, since I haven't got all 120 shines, but it does have a second ending, and just spraying stuff with water is a blast.  Yoshi adds another point. Sound- 5/5, catchy music that plays in your head for a while, and the sound effects are realistic. The Good- HUGE world of play, YOSHI! YOSHI! YOSHI! (holds up yoshi banner) The Bad- play control is rough for rookies at first. The Ugly- Has Mario gained weight?	1
Super Mario Sunshine isn't as good as the other Mario games but it's still packed with loads of fun, puzzles and "other stuff" to have you playing for hours and hours.  The one thing I like about this game is that it's somewhat similar to the others as there are different worlds to go to.  The other good thing is that it's not SIMPLE to beat.  Some of the worlds and/or places are a challenge, if you don't cheat (by guide or internet), this game may have you frustrated for a bit...maybe that's because I never listen to anyone, I just push the A button real quick so I don't have to sit there and talk to them (no patience).  But I suggest that's the better thing to do unless you are COMPLETELY stuck that you're losing your mind.  Mario has his E.Gadd (water pumper) which is actually a pretty nifty gadget.  I love how you can float upwards and zoom across the water.  Yoshi is back as well and a fun part of the game.  The worst parts of Yoshi are he needs a certain fruit to open his shell and secondly, he can't go into the water or he'll disappear into thin air.  This game is fun.  If you don't like fun, puzzling games then this isn't for you but if you loved the other Mario games, I recommend you buy it.  It's worth the price for you can replay it as much as you want (similar to the works of Super Mario 64) and the graphics are good.  The sunglasses are kind'a cool too.  Nice control and wonderful game play.	1
Mario is back with Peach and an entourage of toads including Toadsworth have come to Isle Delfino to relax and unwind. At least, that's their plan...but when they arrive, they find things have gone horribly wrong.   According to the island inhabitants,the person responsible for the mess has a round nose,a thick mustache, and a cap...what?But...that sounds like Mario!?The islanders are saying that Mario's mess has polluted the island and caused their energy source the Shine Sprites, to vanish.   Now the falsely accused Mario has promised to clean up the island,but...how?Never fear! Fludd,the latest invention from Gadd Science, Inc.,can help Mario tidy up the island, and to take on bad guys. That's what the game is mostly about. So if you buy this game I know you'll like it.	1
. STORY - 3/5 This is your typical Bowser-kidnaps-Peach episode, but with a twist. You will be introduced to Shadow Mario, FLUDD, and later Bowser Jr. ("FLUDD" is a water gun-backpack combo which Mario uses frequently throught the levels to clean up the mess left by his imposter, Shadow Mario.) Super Mario Sunshine is one of the wackiest Mario games yet. REPLAY VALUE - 5/5 There's a lot to do in this game, and once you've done everything, you're ready to do it all over again. DIFFICULTY - 4/5 Some of the levels are considerably easy, but others are so hard they're just frustrating. An example of this is a level where there are a bunch of platforms too far apart for Mario to jump across. So he has to have these fat guys THROW him from platform to platform. The only real challenge here is making sure you're lined up PERFECTLY with the fat guys so you won't get thrown in the wrong direction. Miscalculate just slightly, and you will fall to your doom. GRAPHICS - 5/5 The graphics are great, especially the water. Not many games can compare graphically to this one. SOUND - 5/5 This game has the original Mario music in it. All the music, new or old, is enjoyable. There are a few vocals, but for some reason you have to turn up the volume to hear them. CONTROLS - 2/5 Mario can preform many different moves, but there is a downside. Several of the button combos for these moves are very similar, and often I would find myself doing a Spin Attack when I was really trying to do a Side Somersault. The jump moves drive me insane! Also, on a few levels the controls seem purposely screwed-up just to make the level difficult. And that's even more frusterating! TOTAL - 24/30 Pretty good. I did enjoy this game admist its flaws. I recommend it to anyone over 8, for frustration purposes.	1
Okey, this game is great, but since when does Shigeru Miyamoto-san (no I'm not trying to act like I know japanese, but Mr. Miyamoto disserves to be treated with respect) not direct Mario Game, MARIO WAS HIS IDEA. That's why this got 4 stars instead of 5. Now, onto the game. Graphics 9/10 Great graphics, fantastic water effects, When Mario steps in goo (you'll find out about that when you play, I make it a point not to give away the stroy, just to review it.) the goo will stay on you, untill you get wet or shake it off of course. You'll also leave footprints, and when you slide in it, the goo will cover any part of your body that touches it, it's funny seeing mario with green and yellow stuff all over his face. Sound 8/10 Fantastic, the opening scene has full voice acting, a first for mario games, a very tropicle soundtrack. You can even hear the wave hitting the beach. Just Amazing How Far Technolegy has brought us since the little beeps of the first mario game. Replay Value 10/10 There are 120 shine sprites to collect. And in order to get them all you must but 24 of them by finding 240 blue coins(10 blue coins each) No easy task, this will take months to acomplish even for veteran gamers. Mainly because there are ONLY 240 blue coins in the whole game, some are easy to find others just to hard. I suggest buying a Player's Guide, Which I am Usually Against Doing Overall 9/10 Great Game. Graet Graphis. Great Sound. Great Replay Value. But One Of My Favorite Things Is the return of Yoshi. And Mario's shirt is short-sleeved. For 20 years he's worn that old longsleeved shirt (most people don't know that his overalls used to be red with a blue shirt).Also, when you get 30 stars, you can go to this guy on the beach (he's also in most of the levels) And, he'll give you sunglasses. Most of all they darken the screen somewhat (which is good this game is way to bright) Ounce you beat the last boss (my lips are sealed) You can go to him for a hawaiin t-shirt (it's not really hawaiin, more like delfinoin because it has shine sprites not flowers). BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!	1
Mario has, since the days of the N64, taken a nosedive in regards to general game quality, and Super Mario Sunshine is perhaps the best example of this.  Though the graphics and sound are far superior to the ones seen in the old days (despite the strange shading,) the game itself has suffered. First off, the game is marginally insulting if taken allegorically.  The people of Isle Delphino seem like nothing more than a spoof on Americans.  Loud, annoying, overweight, coming in a variety of "strange" colors and completely unable to solve their own problems.  Just the kind of things a Japanese man would mock about America, especially since Isle Delphino bears a more than passing resemblance to Hawaii. But more importantly, the game's summary reads like your laundry list of afternoon chores.  Mario's gameplay used to revolve around "Get the Fireball Power, Kill the Bad Guy, Invade the Castle, Save the Princess, etc..."  Now, it's "Water the Plant, Save the Animal, Clean the Wall, etc..." This is, by and large, a problem that ALL recent Nintendo games (except Metroid Prime, of course,) have suffered from.  Doing simple and bland chores is not an appropriate substitute for actual adventure, and Shigeru Miyamoto; the "father" of Mario, aught to be ashamed of himself for falling so far.	-1
this game is harder than the one for nintendo 64 100 times more difficult i cant play it too frustrating too hard too many puzzles brain draining every time you play don't get this game until your very sure that you are patient and able enough to play this game	1
ok, i haven't beat it yet but it is way better than luigis mansion. reasons y r because luigis mansion was the easiest game ever. i beat it in a month. this game is more challenging. smss has better gameplay,graphics,storyline,(u can use yoshi instead of a boo finder) what im trying to say is this game is a great game so buy it	1
It is just so hard to come by with any other video game icon other than Mario these days. Still, it has been a long voyage that really never seems to end, although it has lasted only 20 years and thensome. From his beginnings with Donkey Kong, and all the way to the spin-offs that don't have anything to do with anything outside of action. Still, every which way Nintendo has gone with another conjured Mario game, it just keeps getting better and better. Still, it was a very big surprise not to release a Mario game as the debut of Nintendo's Gamecube, a similiar move just like the old days of video games in the 1980's. Still, there always can be more than meets the eye with Mario. Super Mario Sunshine, is a whole bit similar than Super Mario 64 back in 1996. Unlike the previous game, Mario is a little bit complicated to control, but it has a lot of the same effects and moves that Mario had before, except the twists with the Fludd waterpack. The game is around Mario being accused of destroying the landscape around Delfino Plaza, and all the other sevral worlds. It really isn't Mario, it is a shadow demon, who looks like Mario. The game evoloves around much fewer worlds as the successor, to Super Mario 64. It is worth the challenge, but does fall back a little bit as being as strong, and challenging. The game does also feature some other feels, including cleaning, and shooting critters and other things with the water cannon. The game does take a whole lot of time to get used to, especially when it comes to trying to make all those camera angles accurate, which also hurts in the forward motion. However, the graphics and the feel of the game is much the same and a little bolder than Mario 64. The game does feature new challenges, but can be a little bit compliacted at first, including a pachinko machine mini-game, and extreme bosses including Petey Piranha and the infamous King Boo, from Luigi's Mansion. Although many people may not enjoy this game as much as Super Mario 64, it is a lot more challenging than meets the eye, and could've had a few more worlds to arrange around it. Arguably, Super Mario Sunshine has a whole lot more to offer, but a little bit easier move would be to offer more worlds around. If you have the Gamecube, this has to be one of the few must-haves for the system. Try it, and be a plumber-mania buff like Mario.	1
No one messes with Mario's vacation! Super Mario Sunshine for Nintendo GameCube is Mario's biggest, most amazing adventure ever. This is the only Super Mario game for GameCube, and it the best game for Nintendo GameCube.	1
If you played Super Mario Sunshine's popular predecessor, Super Mario 64, then you already have a good idea what Super Mario Sunshine is like.  It follows the same formula as Mario 64, only the castle is now replaced by an island resort. As you collect several stars and uncover secrets, more portals and worlds open up for you to explore. The new island theme is probably due to the fact that some of the Gamecube's new graphics can best be shown off in this type of environment.  Impressive "shiny water" and advanced shading are everywhere and even the bad guys are liquid-shaped gooey messes which also show-off the Gamecube's graphics.  Although the game goes to extremes sometimes with the aforementioned example, it still doesn't lose that old fashioned Mario gameplay that has made so many of the titles in this classic series a joy to play.  I only have two small complaints about the game. One is that I still occasionally have problems with the 3-D engine, especially when trying to find things above Mario or when objects block my line of sight. I also thought there was too much dialogue in Super Mario Sunshine.  Now, heavy reading in a game is never a bad thing and many of my favorite games are rich in-depth RPG's but sometimes it doesn't belong in certain games, and Mario is one of those titles because the game is about fun gameplay action rather than text heavy dialogue.  It doesn't take away from the game but I thought Mario 64 had a better balance. I probably enjoyed Super Mario 64 more than Super Mario Sunshine but I would still recommend Mario's newest adventure to anyone that owns a Gamecube.  It's a nice addition to one of the best gaming series on any console.	1
it is a great game but it doesnt match mario 64. its a good game but its not that easy not that hard. its a pretty fun game though like don't think it sucks it is a good game like you know id buy it, but only because its like $30. if it was 50 darra i don't think so. but its a good game. i don't think its bad cause its like the other mario's. save the princess save the princess save her mario save her crap.	1
After 6 years since the hit Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine is unveiled by Nintendo.  I for one was anxiously awaiting this game more than any other.  It is probably because I have loved every Mario game ever, well except Mario 2, but that is another story.  While Super Mario Sunshine contains all of the things that make a platform game great, it is just a tad disappointing as a Mario game.  Don't get me wrong the game is a good one, however, there are just a few things that make it slide from being worthy to Super Mario 64. The graphics are what you would expect from a Gamecube game.  They are all very beautiful and detailed, and a big improvement from the 64 version.  The water effects are amazing, especially in the Hotel level.  Seeing the sunset on the water is truly exceptional.  On the point of character design, Mario has never looked better.  The habitants of Isle Delfino are nice too, but they all look the same with the exception of color.  The only disappointment would be the enemies.  Most of them are just rip offs of the originals, and they don't even look that great.  The good, however, totally overcome the bad in this department. Sound/Music is up next and this is the part of the game that unfortunately fails the most.  The music for each level is just a tad too mellow for my tastes.  It does have a hawaiian ring to it though, so if you prefer jazzy tunes then don't let this disappoint you.  A remix of the classic Mario theme does appear in the game though, so there is some ups in that department.  The voice acting though is incredibly dull.  Peach sounds like a total ditz, the Chancellor has had a bit too much caffeine, and Mario is confined to the usual grunts and yells.  So, basically while the music and sound is lackluster, it is something that can be overlooked. The gameplay is what you would expect from a next gen Mario game.  Nintendo decided to go with the collect-a-thon style gameplay with this one as well.  You go through a total of 6 unique worlds each with their own objectives.  Passing these objectives will earn you a "shine", similar to Super Mario 64's "stars."  There are 120 in all but only around 75 are needed to get to the final boss.  The main new thing in this game is the use of a water pack called "FLUUD."  With it you can spray gunk to uncover items, attack enemies, boost high in the air, or glide across the water.  Along with this Mario has retained his old moves such as side flip, the double and triple jumps, and more. There is also the addition of "Challenge Levels" which will bring back some great platforming memories.  Though challenging and sometimes frustrating (i.e. throwing the controller against the wall) these levels give some spice to the game. All in all, while this game has its frustrating moments, and even sometimes repetitive ones.  It is still a great platform game that is essential to any Gamecube owners library.  Some will love this game just for the fact that it is Mario, while others will find this game to more of a gimmick than anything.  I, however, looked past the minor problems and really enjoyed the game.  If you are a fan of platform games in general, a Mario fanatic, or just want to sit down and enjoy a challenging game, Super Mario Sunshine will not disappoint.	1
In all honesty, this game is better than just four, but not quite 5 stars. The Gamecube lacked a real Mario game for some time, and then finally Sunshine showed up. First of all, this game is so much better looking than its predecessor Mario 64. It is also so much smoother, and seems more entertaining as well. While the story (which I will not discuss) was a little weak and strange, the game is very clever and fun. As far as weapons, the FLUDD wins high marks for originality. It is easy to use and also fun. It's also more than a means of "doing in" enemies. It doubles as a method to get to areas it would be impossible to get to otherwise. The graphics, like most every Gamecube game I have, are fabulous. The large amounts of water in the game are really detailed and very beautiful. The only problem as far as graphics is the "slow-downs" when you fight Bowser at the end of the game. Otherwise, everything is smooth and a real pleasure to look at. Music and sound effects are very good too. The music really does capture the atmosphere of the levels they are in. Sunshine, like all the Mario games I can think of, uses the tried and true "Bowser kidnaps Toadstool" story, but it plays a little twist on it. This twist is interesting, a little disturbing, and not really necessary. It really could have had a better story, but the one it has works pretty good. In closing, if you like Mario games this is your only choice as far as a Mario platform game goes. But it's a very good only choice. It's got all kinds of fun stuff to do, and most people should really enjoy their time playing this game. I know I did.	1
Link's new cel-shaded PaRappa-paper appearance; Metroid reinvented as an FPS; Mario's latest stint as an Earth-cleansing Greenpeace spokesman; the mere fact that Pikmin even exists-many gamers have taken these as sure signs that Shigeru Miyamoto's sanity meter has finally hit rock bottom. Here's hoping the entire video game industry contracts a crippling case of mad cow disease. In Super Mario Sunshine, paradise turns into a public relations nightmare when a beloved Italian is falsely accused of dirtying up an island resort with ugly magic gloop, chasing away the island's magical Shine Sprites and making things dark and dirty for vacationers everywhere. Now, in order to make reparations, he has to clean up the island using his patented F.L.U.D.D. water cannon and enter a variety of surreal island sub-worlds to explore, jump, dive, race, hover, and squirt his way to the missing Shines. If Mario Sunshine seems a lot like Mario 64 with a water cannon, that's not too far from the truth. Yes, the Shines are the equivalent of Mario 64's Stars. And yes, Delfino Plaza, much like Mario 64's castle, acts as a "hub" that connects the sub-worlds together. The levels are even structured in the same episodic fashion-one level contains eight "episodes" or missions-though the objectives are often less vague (thanks to a quick pre-mission "fly-through"), the changes to the level in between each visit are much more visible, and it's much harder to "accidentally" stumble upon a Shine you weren't supposed to just yet. Levels are crafted with endless care, and each stage is its own preposterous superplayground-and a single level is packed with more gameplay variety than the entire length of your standard Mario-free 3D platform adventure. The "challenge types" are easily categorized, and you'll quickly recognize a pattern for the episodes in each sub-world: Fight a boss; collect eight red coins; explore a complex maze; win a race; fight the boss again in weirder circumstances; find a hidden cave that leads to a trippy obstacle course; chase down Shadow Mario; etc. But even though you may be collecting eight red coins for the eighth red time, you're never doing it quite the same way-and unthinkably clever level layouts mean things rarely get tedious or annoying. Rest assured, Mario's new ability to squirt water isn't merely a gimmick so Nintendo can say, "Look, it's different"-here, it's as natural and integral a part of Mario's move list as his wall jump, butt stomp, or just good ol' fashioned ability to walk forward. There's hardly a moment when you aren't hovering or squirting or executing some sort of hover/squirt combo maneuver, be it to hose down an enemy, land a tricky jump, water a plant in the hopes of revealing some sort of pleasant surprise, or just giddily annoy the endlessly agreeable citizens of Delfino. The GameCube controller seems specifically designed for the task-double jumps, triple jumps, wall jumps, and backflips are executed with supernatural ease; narrow pathways are navigated effortlessly; and the analog shoulder button makes water cannon control a brainless affair. This is one of the tightest-controlling games you'll ever play. Mario Sunshine's graphics are best described as larger-than-life and absolutely alive. The smooth animation constantly delights, and a curious peek in the distance reveals an entire world of bulbous happy things hopping and bopping and glooping about. The sheer sense of scale is astonishing-sometimes you can see entire levels looming way out in the distance-and often leaves you with the overwhelmed, overjoyed feeling that there may, in fact, just be too many things to do in this damn game. The effects are glorious-the water (squirted or swum-through) is gorgeous, and the mirror effects are mind-bogglingly cool. The voice-acting in cut-scenes is weirdly understated and a bit rushed, but the garbled villager-speak is great, and the music is classic Mario. The one shortfall is the close-up graphical detail, where the primitive textures stand in sharp contrast to the rest of the game's polished glory. In summary: Yes, it's much bigger than Luigi's Mansion; yes, it's very, very much like Mario 64; no, you don't spend the whole game scrubbing dirt off walls as some sort of interactive environmental message; and yes-oh, hell yes-Mario Sunshine is exactly the brilliant, enormous, endlessly fun GameCube purchase-justifying Miyamoto supergame you were hoping it would be. Shine on, you crazy designer.	1
This was a cute game...very cute.  The graphics were better than many of the other Mario games.  I have never seen a plot like that.  It's a challenge too.  I still haven't gotten to the end of the game, and I've owned it for awhile.  If you get ONE game this year, get this game.  It's very fun.  I really liked how it was different from any other Mario game.	1
I've been a Mario fan since 1989 and i've played many great Mario games. I do have to say, this game is one of the best Mario games i have played as of now. The graphics and great, the gameplay is great as usual, and the music was very kool. I had previously said this game was hard, but as i replayed it over and over, i realized that it was simple. I give Nintendo alot of credit for developing this game. This is a must-have for any owner of a GCN. Whoever doesn't own this game doesn't deserve to be called a gamer.	1
Super mario is know for it's long legacy in nintendo. From the NES all the way to the gamecube it has chaged the way we look at video games. Super mario sunshine is no exception. The greatest things about this game is it's graphics, it's gameplay and it's story. The graphics in this game are one of the best I have seen in a long time. It has vibrant colors such as pink, purple and orange(the colors of Yoshi). Everything is taken into consideration for the gaphics. The graphics are so detailed you can see a shoadow on every creature or inhabitant on isle Delfino. Another good thing about the game is it's story. Unlike Mario 64 it has a working story-line which this: When Mario arrives on Isle Delfino, the once pristine island has been pollutted with graffiti. Even worse Mario has been blamed for the mess!!! Now Mario has to clean up and hunt down the real culpret. Personally I like the addition of Mario's water pack(FLUUD). The bad things about this game are it's levels(not enough)and it's difficulty(too easy). Overall this game is not for everyone but it is very fun to play.	1
Mario is always gonna be good. I liked this game, Its fun but let me list the pros and cons. Pros: good graphics and control. The water effects rock. enemys cool, good storyline. Xtras good. cons:camera needs work, some stuff is dumb. At parts its hard but thats ok. If your a mario fan this game is pretty good. (-:	1
Okay when I first heard about Super Mario Sunshine in August I thought it was going to better than it really is. I guess its just wishful thinking but this could be considered a tasty appetizer to Super Mario 128 if that game isn't just a rumor.   Dont get me wrong though the game is only slightly disappointing. There are numerous things to do in this game and they are quite addictive. The graphics could have been a lot better I mean except for the secret courses I like the graphics in Super Mario 64 better. Also the musical score in Sunshine isn't bad but it really doesnt match the excellent melodies 64 had.   The battles,races,and other things are very fun. Still it could have been done better/   We should cut Super Mario a little slack because if the rumor of a Super Mario 128 turns out to be true then we can consider Super Mario Sunshine as a tasty little appetizer for Super Mario 128 which if it turns out to be a true game could be the best damn Mario game since Super Mario Allstar's version of Super Mario Bros 3. Hopefully it will be an improvement from not just Sunshine but the classic Super Mario 64 as well.	1
This Mario game is beyond my expectation. After purchasing Luigi's Mansion, I was disapointed by how short the game as well as other things. THIS GAME IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THAT! This is a very well thought out game that has a ton of replay value and it takes a very long time before you are able to collect all the possible 120 shines! The only thing I really dislike about this game is that it is for one player only!!! They should have made a multie player with Luigi! Overall a great game to rent of buy if you are that diehard Mario or Miyamoto fan!!!	1
I think I'll make this short and sweet. This game is very, very fun, but a bit too short. Cleaning up also tends to get a bit boring. But they do bring back the old, jumpy, springy, bouncy moves and jumps. I also wish that the Yoshi's were more involved in the game. Overall, I'd say you might want to rent it first.	1
This obviously isn't going to get "Best Mario Ever" quotes from people, but it is a very good game. I don't understand why so many people I know around real life and from the internet hate this game so much. It retains the great Nintendo gameplay, and level designs. For some reason Mario seems to be losing some popularity; bashes towards a Mario game used to be so few and far between! :( Gameplay: 9.5/10 The level design is pure genuis as usual, and near-flawless control. Has Nintendo ever made a game with bad control? I haven't seen one and I doubt I ever will. One of my favorite levels had you climb up metal chain-link like walls, walk on very small pipes really high up in the air, and many other great platforming elements. Fighting enemies, while standing on a skinny pipe way up in the air is cool in my book! That level is just one of the many examples of great level design, that we've all come to expect and love from Nintendo. I took off a point for the poor FMVs, pretty much no story value, and the vacation theme isn't very good in my opinion. Many people complain about the camera, because they can't control it; it's all manually controlled, with the L Button serving kind of like in the Zelda games, where it positions the camera right behind the character. I had ZERO problems with it through out the game, but many people don't like it; I guess it's just a matter of personal preference, eh? Either way, the camera shouldn't be bad enough to make the game un-playable. The game is very lenghy though. It takes around 25 hours to just do the basic levels; finding all 120 shines(about 80 are required to finish the game), all of the red and blue coins(and believe me, there's a lot of them!), and the optional levels add a bunch of extra hours, which are played through without your water pack;(it's good to play some good old classic Mario, even if it is just for a short level) The game at 100% should take just under 40 hours, or possibly more. Graphics: 7.5/10 The graphics are in one word, decent. You get some cool water effects, and some pretty good draw distance. The art and textures on the other hand borderline on bad. I don't play games for eye-candy though, I'll take great gameplay over great graphics anyday, and that's what Mario offers. Sound: 6.5/10 I don't know about the music. It has some good tunes to go along with it, but then there are a few decent, and bad ones thrown into the mix. It gets the job done. The thing that brings the score down a little more are the voice-overs; listening to the intro made my ears bleed. ;) Overall(not an average): 9.2/10 or 5 Stars My scores aren't an average.(although sometimes my scores are the same as the average) I take into effect that the Gameplay is most important in Mario's case; the game shines brightly there, and I also take into effect that the Sound, and Graphics shouldn't take away from the score too much because those aren't the reasons we play games; they are just bonus features. The gameplay is so good and fun in this game, that it over-shadows the bad parts and really makes it overall an exellent game. Mario fans, platformer fans, or if you're just a fan of fun games, then go with Super Mario Sunshine!	1
Super Mario Sunshine is a great game with hours and hours of game play. The graphics are great. The story line is that Mario has to go around cleaning up the island to get sun sprites to save the island from darkness.  Each location is a rich 3D world that allows a lot of freestyle play to explore the level with lots of hidden areas to find. The game makes full use of the controller with all the buttons and control pads having a function. One thing to mention since there are many hours of game play it's practically a necessity to get a memory card for your saved games.	1
Didgu know, this is the reason why I got my name.  Other than that, Mario has been around 4 over 22 years, and he has never dissapointed me in a series realese, and this is his latest.  After 6 long years after the revolotionary Mario 64, Mario is back, and this game in my opionion lives up to the hype.  And why is gamespot calling this the most dissapointin game of the year?  As far as I'm conserned, this is one of the best game of the year.  It may not be Mario 64, but this has evrey right to be call one of the best mario games ever.  I rented it, and ended up buyin it the next day.  If u have a cube, it be a shame if u didn't have this in ur collection.	1
Mario is back and makes his debut on the gamecube.  Mario's on vacation while an imposter messes with the pollution of Isle Delfino.  Mario is blamed for the mess and he has to clean it up.	1
Alright, so it is a mildly "kiddish" installment into the Super Mario Bros line, but before you judge it, give it a shot. Mario Sunshine is very influenced by the current "cartoon-like" video game craze that has proven very successful in Japan (I.E. Pokemon). It is extremely consuming once you get the hang of it! It can be simple at times and challenging at others. This game will keep you thinking your way through a semi-rpg envoirnment, in which you are provided a water-blasting backpack to clean up the mysterious sludge which Mario is falsely accused of spreading around the tropical Isle Delfino... oh yeah, you also have to save the Princess (But what else is new?). The only true drawback to this game is the poor control layout; they'll frustrate until you have them down. All in all, Mario Sunshine is far superior to Luigi's Mansion and I consider it to be the first true (as in traditional) Mario adventure game to come to the Gamecube.	1
This is my first GameCube game and it's pleased me a great deal. There hasn't been a good Mario title since the Super Nintendo days. Sunshine has revived the series and has brought a whole new level of enjoyment to fans. The style of animation and great level design is the true star of this game. Everything, even the dirt, it beautiful. You'll feel like you're playing a hand drawn animated movie. Two big down sides to this game are the controls and poor camera movements. The control can be very frustrating. Mario doesn't always shoot when you want him to shoot and he doesn't always jump where you want him to jump. They are bearable but they could have been better. The camera is just terrible. You have to fight with it all the time. Not only do you have to control Mario but you have to move the camera yourself also. This can be very difficult during battles or tough situations. While this is an extremely delightful game, it's still not perfect. So out of a perfect 5 I give it: Graphics: 5.0 Sound: 5.0 Control: 4.0 Fun Factor: 5.0	1
Despite owning all three current consoles, and warming up slowly to XBox the Nintendo GameCube dominates my living room. Nintendo's lunchbox sized console already has a whopping twelve games in my collection (PS 2 has 8, and XBox has 4 in contrast.) GameCube also has far more games that I'm looking forward to than the other two consoles. The only real problem that Nintendo has is its lack of advertising, and its reputation for kiddy oriented games... like Mario Sunshine.  The storyline of Mario Sunshine (and title) seem as though it was intended for a four year old, but then you get into the game play which is definitely too challenging for a younger player. Mario Sunshine is the most difficult Mario game to come out in a very long time, and that makes it great! Sadly this challenging little masterpiece has a couple of problems with it. Fist of all, all of the levels are tropical themed, we don't have the multi-world set up past Marios have had, no hot lava levels, no ice worlds, etc. I also miss the Mario Karate of Mario 64, and I miss it badly. The game is a blast, and no GameCube owner should be without it, whether a kid or an adult, because both younger players and adults will appreciate it, perhaps for different reasons. Little kids may actually enjoy the story elements, while adults will appreciate this masterpiece of a challenging platformer. I still like Mario 64 better though. Hopefully the next Mario game will have the Mario Karate, and Luigi... split screen two player mode, etc.	1
This game is great. It's better than Mario64 because of the graphics, added features and adventures (like blue coins), new characters, new moves, and a better plot (although Peach does end up being kidnapped AGAIN!). The one problem is that it follows the same format as Mario64, and the last boss is incredibly easy, in my opinion. This game is a necessity for all Mario lovers.	1
This is a fun challenge, but this game has waaaaay more cons than pros. but i like it anyway [i don't know why]. Nintendo could've made this game the "best game ever" but they really FORGOT SOME MAJOR THINGS THAT MADE MARIO GAMES GREAT. this is a long list so ill break it down 1. powerups- where the heck did these go? you cant have mario without powerups....we need mario shooting fireballs and flying with his cape on, and racoon mario....i could go on and on about this...the only "powerup" in this game that mario has [if you consider it a powerup] is the FLUDD...i think nintendo needs to read their history books.... 2.bowser- ok....where is bowser??? mario is supposed to defeat BOWSER!!! not some blue clone thing of himself...c'mon mario64 even had bowser in it....i know most of you will agree with me on this...mario is suppossed to defeat bowser! 3. koopa kids- where are the koopa kids? did they die or what? they dissapeared after super mario world...they couldve made this really good IF THEY AT LEAST HAD THE KOOPA KIDS IN THIS.. 4. way toooooo similar too...mario64. they just made it tropical and replaced stars with shine sprites.......which brings up the subject of.. 5.shine sprites-ok...wheres the stars? mario gets stars NOT STUPID SHINE SPRITES!!!!! overall this is a good game [but i don't know why i like it cuz of all the obvious faults]	1
Okay this game is pretty much nothing like Super Mario 64 but the gameplay is equally as good. The music in Super Mario Sunshine isn't as impressive and snazzy as the music in Super Mario 64 but Sunshine is still lots of fun to play. Like Mario 64 all the missions run in kind of a pattern. In this one its usually fight the first boss, collect red coins,fight the boss in a harder setting, run after Shadow Mario. Instead of Bowser appearing as the bad guy more than once(he is in this game but at the very end) you are sent to chase Shadow Mario which is lots of fun. The graphics are glorius,the missions often very clever and my favorite challenges of all are the secret hidden levels. This is slightly dissapointing and I mean very slightly because the only gripe I have is that the music isn't as good as Mario 64 the rest is all equal. This is a game of high excellence. You shouldnt give up on it and you especially shouldnt write a review on it until you're finished beating it. In my opinion this is fun to the nth degree.	1
I love every mario game. And this one is good. This is one of my favorite games for gamecube. And i played it for hours. This game is a must buy.	1
I am a big Nintendo fan! I have almost every Nintendo system/game player out there except Super Nintendo. But my favorite game would be the Mario Games. They are so fun, comical and great to play. When I finally got a gamecube, I was so happy to see that a Mario game was being released. I begged my dad to take us to blockbuster and rent some games and when he did, I was pleased of what I saw. Let me take you through my eyes: Mario, Peach, and her minions (Toads) go to a sunny tropical island to relax, but find out the island has been vandalized by a villan who is suposedley HIM! To regain the island peoples trust and also to discover what is going on, he and a water cannon named Fludd, are going to clean up the island. As you do, you need to collect Shines that the imposter has stolen, to return the island back to its sunny form. I made it up to the amusement park level, and found out the imposter's real identity. It took me as a real suprise...but it was interesting. Since I only got so far, I can only say it's a real treat and a great game to play if you like Mario64. (He still does the little Here we goooooooooo! only he says "Shineeeeeeeeeeeeeeee". I hope to see a Mario game that is a two player that you can play his brother at the same time....but it depends... I would advise you to rent or buy this game, because in the end even if you don't rent it, I am positive you will not be displeased!	1
As of late, Nintendo has been producing some pretty fine games for their Gamecube (Resident Evil, Eternal Darkness etc...) and this may top them all. It takes me back to the days of Mario 64 with the view and moves that Mario can perform, and even though the story may be a little stupid and childish, it's still the same old Mario and the game base is the same as it always has been. After all, gameplay is really what matters in the end. P.S.: XBox and Playstation 2 owners need to stop hating on the GC and it's games by giving them bad reviews without even playing them just because they're jealous that the certain game only came out for GC and not the console they own	1
I've played this game for hours (demos, rentals, friend's houses, etc..) and I must say that it is addicting.  From collecting shines to hovering above the rest of the world, it's hard to find a glitch in Nintendo's latest installment of Mario.  Here what I thought of Super Mario Sunshine for the Nintendo Gamecube: 1. The graphics: Beatutiful!!!  Perhaps the best to be shown on Gamecube yet, SMS looks awsome!  From the shimmering water to the sandy beaches, this game really packs in the feeling of a vacation in the bahamas.  Mario looks as good as ever, everything is sharp and convincing.  The civilians and people looks about as good as it can get, and the water; my goodness it's incredible!  And with the whole point of it being really dark (and shadowy) toward the beggining of the game with no shines to 100 later on, it really goes from dark, cloudy, and gray to sunny, warm, and humid.  The graphics bring this game alive, and deliver what past Mario games couldn't: real worlds! 2. The gameplay: wonderful! It's just fun!  It really is like Mario 64 in dozens of ways.  As with 64, you collect as many stars as u can to beat the game.  Only this time they look like mini suns, and are called "Shines."  To get shines u must complete various tasks, whether it be cleaning up grafity to defeating a boss.  You'll need every skill in the book to collect these shines.  To go with that a ton of patience.  This game just goes on and on, and every minute that goes by just keeps getting funner!  By far the funnest of the series, Mario brings that innocent sense of fun that has been missed recently with games like HALO, GTA3, Max Payne, and other shooters.  Mario is back and bettter than ever, now armed with a super-fun hose type thing (don't know what it is) and all of Mario's old moves (super slam, jump, slide, glide, etc...) 3. The overall depth and reaplay value: tons!  I'm not sure how many shines there are, at least a hundred.  And each shine (whether buying it or winning it) feels like a major accomplshment.  Fun to just fool around after beating (which could take weeks, even months) this game does not disapoint.  It's long, fast, fun, and easy to control.  I could play this for hours, and feel tempted to buy a Gamecube just for Mario. Overall, I'd just like to say how much fun this is, and how good the graphics are.  The new hose thing is a blast, whether it be shooting or hovering, it's safe to say this ladies and gentlemen: Mario is back, fun, and new.  A bit of new spice to the old winning formula, Super Mario Sunshine is worth your fifty bucks, and will go down (i think) as one of the classic Nintendo games of all time.  Why Nintendo will never die, Mario.  Hope this helped, thx!	1
i personally think this game is better than super smash bros. melee. i love is game. don't get me wrong i like melee, but i think that i am more partial to this because it is more of an adventure game, were as melee is is a combo of fighting and adverture. at any rate, this game has a good plot and you really don't get tired of playing it. i was frustrated sometimes w/ melee because i would be fighting and would get to the magic hand and it would always beat me. sunshine is original and is meant for the young and old alike, and in gamimg i consider myself older (23 years old). most of the NGC title are meant for the younger generation, but i must say that this game appealed to me because i am such a HUGE mario bros. fan. lastly, i want to say to everyone you have to buy this game it is soooo fun, i has a higher replay value that melee (to me). i just got mario party 4 and I HOPE that it is just as fun as this game is. the lady in circuit city said if you like sunshine than you'll like MP4. thanks	1
What do I love about SMS... almost everything. The classic Mario 64 gameplay makes a triumphant return, if you played it, you'll automatically feel right at home with Mario Sunshine. And the waterpack is a fantastic addition. There's so much that it adds to the gameplay mechanics that it's just PLAIN NOT FUNNY. The controls are tight; some of the tightest ever. What else do I love... the graphics. Everything is detailed (except for Isle Delfino's inhabitants), and everything is affected by the heat... you can see objects in the distance blurred by the heat. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING reflects in the water, from coins, to the sky, including clouds, to mountains, and Mario himself. Nothing is left out. I also love it's challenge. It's a little easy at first, but some objectives are very challenging... sometimes too challenging. Oh, and the camera isn't nearly as bad as everyone is saying it is. Trust me. What don't I love about SMS... Well, there's not too many levels... 7 or 8. But there's still 120 shines to collect. But after a while you get sick of the levels you're playing in, and when you do beat the game after getting 60 shines or so, you probably won't have the incentive to get the other 60 shines. And if you do, there's not much of a reward. I wish something could've been done about that. But other than that, SMS is a great game, and you're doing a disservice to yourself by not playing it.	1
The fact that this game is a Mario title should be enough to make you buy it, but this game really is good.  Super Mario Sunshine graphicly is superior to any other gam on the Games Cube, the palyability is imense and its Mario!!! This games is similar to the last except, you don't collect stars, you collect, Sprites.  Yoshi is back, and there is also the addition of new characters and new moves.  Buy this game and you won't be dissapointed.	1
I want to say this game rocks. I was left frustrated when I finished the last Mario four times in a row, and when I had to wait six years to finally see a new installment of the happy little Italian plumber. I was expecting something great, and let me tell you that you CAN get your hopes up extremely high. Shigyeru Myamoto and his team of crowd pleaser did a great job. My hopes about this game were by far overwhelmed. The good thing is this game is long. Very long. Unless you know everything by heart there is no way you will finish it in less than thirty hours, accounting for the fact that you want to get all the shines. And there is 120 of them soooo...heheheh! The graphics are excellent, the water effects are the best i've ever seen(maybe along with the water effets in STARFOX Adventures) The sounds are great, although it is pretty hard to hear the characters talk during the cutscenes because the music is very loud (yes, they have actual voices now! Alas, Mario is the only one who does not. Although was given profusion of woohoo's, yehaa's and yahh's for this game by the great Charles Martinet.) The controls are tight, so very tight, like any Mario game, and you can expect finding the trademark moves, like the triple jump, super jump, plus some new ones (about 30), provided by the water nuzzles you get. The only glitch I see in this game are the difficulty at times, where you wish your controller was made of concrete when you throw it at the wall in sheer frustration because you lost 20 lives trying to reach that one platform. And believe, me, it as happened to me and I'am not exagerating. Also, when will anyone figure how to make a platformer with good camera movement. There is always that one platfom you miss because of the lousy camera angle. (sometimes it even comes to having a building between you and the Marioman, where Mario becomes a shadow you see through solid concrete. That was what I liked about Luigi's Mansion. Objects would get transparent.) Other that that I have 51 shines right now, and have not yet resorted to using a guide, but I'm this close. Overall, I give this game 11/10. If you love Mario, and all related to it, get this game as soon as possible. Otherwise, get it anyways.	1
Do not be dismayed by the seemingly 'hippie'-like environmentally sound premise of the new Mario installment -- the only tree-hugging in this game occurs when you scale one of the many towering trees to better view the breathtaking landscape before you.  Mario Sunshine's gaming environment can accurately be described in one word: staggering.  From neck-straining roller coasters that would shame Six Flags, to underwater oceanic worlds worthy of a Discovery channel special, Mario's new adventure is a orgiastic feast for the eyes at every turn. His adventure is no less satisfying.  His new ability, the water jet-pack/nozzle gizmo, at first made me skeptical of the game, but upon picking up the FLUDD, one realizes the infinite range of motion and dimension it adds to the game.  Mario can suddenly hover, attack in 360 degrees, backflip with a powerful frontal attack, and not to mention... annoy his friends by gratuitously squirting them in the face.  He'll need all of those strategies and more as he faces his largest set of challenges yet: From battling gigantic elastic squid, to exterminating dozens of ghastly ghosts on a haunted beach, to hunting down your own shadowy clone (or so it would seem...), Mario faces task after task of the weirdest of the weird.  And even after he's beaten the game, that represents just about half of the goals to be reached in the game, with tons of hidden missions and extra-difficult bonus missions.  The replay value here is unmatched by any previous Mario game. And, old-schoolers need not fear, there's plenty in this game for you as well.  For any fans of the older platform-based puzzles that defined very early Mario's and even the last installment for the N64, you will be amazed and alternately befuddled by the "secret" missions embedded in your quest.  Complete with 3-D rotating, bouncing and our old favorite VANISHING blocks, Mario will often find himself stripped of his new FLUDD device, facing infinitely complex platform puzzles to navigate with just his jumping abilities (which of course include wall-kicks, backflips, twirls and triple jumps).  These unexpected throwbacks with their new amazingly difficult incarnations will leave you constantly changing your camera angle as you fight to balance yourself on a rotating beam or hang on just long enough to the dissolving blocks to see your goal narrowly escape you. With so much to do and such a brilliantly constructed world to view it in, Mario Sunshine provides endless hours of fun and amazement for any video gamer.  Without a doubt, if you own a GameCube, you MUST own this game.	1
I rented Super Mario Sunshine instead of buying it, and I'm glad. (It's always a good idea to rent a game first... The graphics are gorgeous, and the sound is good too (I don't usually pay that much attention to sound in games, so I can't really evaluate it). This is probably one of those "love it or hate it" games. I found the premise -- Mario is falsely accused of splattering a resort town with paint, and is sentenced to community service cleaning up the mess -- cute but not compelling. The camera drove me crazy. Yes, it's (usually) 360 degrees, but it's also almost always pointed the wrong way. I liked it better when a game's camera would automatically point in a logical direction, even if that meant I couldn't control the camera. Lots of people love this game. If you want a traditional "kill monsters and pick up trinkets" platform game in a 3-D environment, you'll love it too...	-1
I could tell this would be a cool game.  Its really not much like super mario 64.  The water squirter mario has is cool.  You can spray things with it.  You can use it to hover.  Of course you do learn some knew things in the game.  I just rented this and its looking great.  I think lots of people would enjoy this game.	1
It is a lot of fun to play but without the book (or help from some internet sites) Forget about finishing it. The addition of a shooting weapon has really changed Mario it was much more simple when he "just ran and Jumped". (I do wish that they would have added some flying though).	1
Yet another great installment into the mario series. Here's an over view: Graphics 8/10: Smooth and sweet fits this mario game just fine, though I think they could of put a little more detail in. Controls 7.5/10: Easy to learn but not too easy to master. Now here's the only real complaint I have with this game, the camera,  it sometimes ends up where you don't want it to, sometimes causing you your life. You have to operate it manually, so it can be a pain. Gameplay/Fun Factor 9.5/10: Just great mario fun.  Not too chalenging ( Those people who said it was too hard to be fun must stink at video games). Storyline 5/10: Mario takes a vacation, so your thinking "WoW! it's not that same old save Princess Peach story." But Nintendo could help themselves, Peach does get kidnapped a few times. Overall 9.5/10: Great game definetly worth the 50 you have to pay for these things.	1
I wanted to give this game higher stars...I really did.  I have always liked Mario games and this one has some great graphics and some really innovative and fun levels.  So why the mediocre score...the difficulty level.  I don't know what game these other people were playing to say this game is easy!?  Sure some levels are, but the difficulty of some of the non-Fludd using jump-crazy levels is enough to make one go insane.  It is difficulty at the point where the fun level is gone and your Gamecube is in serious danger of getting destroyed.  It doesn't help that Mario's jumping and the camera are chaotic at best.  Maybe if you have all day to sit around and play games this would be an easy game, but weekend warriors beware...you are in for some serious frustration if you buy this game.  I have given up any hope of ever completing it...especially since the five mile long laundry list of stuff you have to do to beat it will have gotten boring long after better games like Metroid or Starfox have come out.	1
Clear and simple, any kid who tries to play Mario for a while will become engrossed in it and like it.  Mario once again delivers a very good platforming experience with a few new advances. First of all, the water pack.  With the FLUDD added to the game, all new moves such as the rocket or hover nozzle allow for dynamically different gameplay than Mario 64.  For those still looking for the vintage Mario moves such as the patented triple jump and other such moves, many of them have been included.  You can still do the smash thing from mid-air, as well as a few others, although a good deal of  your time will be dealing with the FLUDD. For those from an older generation, many of the original Mario's moves have been added once again.  You can ride Yoshi once again, as well as the way that Mario could climb on fences.  As for the game's difficulty, yes, a child could beat Mario at a young age, but it would be very unlikely that they would finish everything.  The addition of blue coins to collect to buy shines(like the stars from M64) add much more depth to the game.  This as well as a few levels without the pack and other challenging levels make sure the entire game is not as much of a breeze as Luigi's Mansion was.  Although these events are not required to beat the game, they are fun. As for gripes I have about the game?  They are few and far between.  I would have liked to see more control while swimming, although the current control sufficed fairly well.  This and a few of the tried-and-true enemies such as goombas and koopas, but the new enemies are interesting as well.  Although the graphics aren't perfect, many of the water effects as well as some of the nicer textures do well. Overall I'd recommend this game to all ages, as it is very fun and not something that you'd be likely to put down unless you were dying of starvation.  It's that good.	1
SUper Mario Sunshine has to be the most anticipated game for Gamecube., and it delivers.  The story goes like this.  After escaping King Boo mario goes on a vacation on the beautiful island of Isle Delfino.  But when the plane almost crah lands into "icky paint like goop" there is something to feel suspicious.  In the background they saw a silhouette(however you spell that) of Mario.  Mario then finds a FLUDD(the water pack.  Mario gets arrested because the islanders think that he's to blame for polluting there island.  They go to court and the judge tells Mario that he can't go back home until he cleans u-p the island.  The polluting sludges up then shine gate, the shine gate is where all the shines gather.  Shines give power and light to Isle Delfino.  Thus begins Super Mario Sunshine, my favorite Mario game ever...   Mario Sunshines gameplay is complex and challenging.  little kids couldn't beat this game with ease because even to an experienced gamer this game is extremely challenging.  There are, well I think there are 10 levels(I haven't unlocked all of them.  There are I think 110 shine sprites, and with in  a level there are 8 episodes.  Each episode has a different challenge to get a different shine sprite.  There are Yoshis also so saddle up.  To get a shine sprite you need to complete a different task with in an episode with in a level.  The challenges can be simple and easy, or complex and difficult.  The bosses are really fun to batle, some easy and some hard  There are also new enemies and new allies including the electric koopas mud monsters etc. and for the allies Nokis and Piantas.   The controlls of the game are really good.  Here are the controlls for Mario...  A is to jump. A and L is the ground pound.  To spin jump you must run in tight circles the press the a button.  To squirt press R to switch nozzles press the X button and to view through Marios eyes in 360 degrees(or the Mario cam) press the Y button.  Press the B button to talk to the islanders.  When you get Yoshi and when you are on his back  here are the controlls... A jump, B eat/talk and all the reest that Mario has.  Overall the controlls are really really good in my opinion...   The graphics are very well done.  They might not be the greatest in the world but they are great.  It's so collerful and beautiful.  Awesome textures although I hate when you go to close to something you can see right through...  BOY DO I HATE THAT.  But oh well...   Mario Sunshine is definetly worth all of that hype.  Beautiful Graphics, awesome controll and gameplay, Miyamato I thank you for such a great job on such an awesome series........... SUPER  MARIO!!!!!!	1
I think that  mario 64 was better, still this one is very good. Much, Much better than Lugis Mansion! The only part of the game that is very bad is the camera... terrible! But the rest is just fun. Buy it, rent it, anything... it is fun! I won't gve 5 star because the camera. Proximo q venha!!	1
In my opinion, while Super Mario 64 is still a fine game, I just can't compare it to this game.  Sunshine is extremely fun, right from the first shine to the last. Graphics:  MUCH better than I expected!  Very attractive, although it may be a little grainy at close view. Rating: 9/10 Sound:  Great themes, amusing voices and great general sound effects. Rating: 10/10 Gameplay: Amazing!  This is the part of the game that struck me as near impossible to beat.  The gameplay is more fun, interesting and inspired than the 64 game.  10/10 is an understatment... Rating: 10/10 Lasting Value:  120 shines, 240 blue coins, a compliment of levels, bosses, and 'special stages' that take on more old style Mario tricks.  Unfortunatly, it doesn't take all that long to get most of the shines and beat the game. Rating: 8/10 Overall: 5/5 stars (9.5/10 review)	1
Wow, after getting this game when it came out and playing it for two weeks, I am still amazed by it. Nintendo has once again delivered a huge hit that will be enjoyed by fans for a long time. Let's get to the basics. Story- What's this? The princess being saved ISN'T the main part of the story? Well, she does get kidnapped a few times(I guess it was unavoidable...) but the game offers a fresh plot. Mario tries to have a relaxing vacation, but before he even arrives, Shadow Mario, his archenemy, as been wreaking havoc on Isle Delfino, where Mario plans to relax. Unfortunately, the town artist's drawing of Shadow Mario is in black and white, so all the people think Mario is guilty. His punishment is to clean up the town, and with that, his good name. Graphics- While not the best on the GameCube, these are very nice graphics that remind me of the days of Super Mario 64 on the N64. There are some nice touches, too, that add to the gameplay, such as enemies exploding or Piantas(residents of the island) celebrating when you free them from Shadow Mario's paint. Very few, if any, graphical flaws make this one beautiful game to look at. 9/10 Control- The controls are very easy to learn and very hard to forget. Once you get down jumping much of the controls are already learned, and the rest of them are really simple, too. The one bad part is the camera, which you have to manually control, making it difficult in some areas, but that's not too much of a problem in most cases. 9/10 Gameplay- Finding all 120 Shine Sprites or those few coins, whatever your task may be, Super Mario Sunshine is a blast to play. You could be surfing on Bloopers or hanging from fences, even riding a roller coaster while destroying a mechanical Bowser(did it come back from Paper Mario?) and all the while you'll be having fun, which is what the game is all about. 10/10 Satisfaction- This game is definitely worth the money for it. Best of all, all of these intricate worlds and characters only take up 7 blocks of memory on your memory card, making it very easy to save. You will not regret purchasing this game, in fact, I've even seen some people get GameCubes simply to own this game. 9.5/10 Sound- The familiar sounds and grunts, along with some cutscenes with full voice features of Mario, the Princess, and any other characters around at the time. The music isn't obtrusive and is familiar of a Mario game. 8.75/10 Overall- This is what Luigi's Mansion was shooting for. They got everything right that was wrong before. The one thing that may discourage players is the aforementioned camera, but in the long run, the tasks are fun enough that even if the camera causes you to fall, you'll just want to climb back up again. Super Mario Sunshine, while reminiscient of the Super Mario 64 game, is a whole new adventure that's loads of fun to play and well worth the time to complete it. Have fun(which you will with this game) and happy gaming. 9.75/10	1
First of all, the graphics.  It is simply astounding.  I always thought Nintendo did "water" better than anyone (i.e. WaveRace 64).  And this is a good thing considering that the setting is a tropical isle.  There is a stage, where you swim in the coral reef, fishing for coins.  Being an avid snorkeler, I was awestruck by the fact that I felt like I was swimming in the ocean while sitting on my couch.  Of course, there will be distractors, who simply cannot get over the cartoon-like graphical nature of the game.  But this is more of a matter of taste.  You need to take it for what is instead of wanting 3-D rendered polygon environment and characters. Having said all this, I still think that Super Mario 64 is a better game.  I have read that the worlds in Sunshine is much bigger than those in 64 but I somehow never got that feeling.  They are about the same and there is less worlds in Sunshine not to mention the lack of variety.  For instance, Mario 64 had 12 different worlds (ice, water, desert, lava, sky, etc.) In Sunshine, all the worlds, more or less, are somewhat similar.  With the introduction of the water pack, you can do so much more with Mario in Sunshine, but I would have preferred the variety in the worlds over controls. All the complaints about the camera-work is valid.  You do have to micromanage to get the best view constantly.  I often found Mario hidden behind buildings and it got frustrating at times.  But it is a small price to pay for such an enjoyable game.  Finally, I also didn't like the fact that for every world, you had to play a specific episode to get a specific sunshine (the main thing you collect through out this game).  I found this a little bit restrictive and less challenging since you pretty much know what you need to do for each episode.  In 64, you were basically thrown in a world and you had to go find the 6 stars hidden throughout the world.  But again, this is only a minor pet-peeve. Over-all, this is the best game for the Gamecube so far (until Zelda comes out).	1
Mario's Back For the Cube!!!! The Story starts out with Mario, Princess Peach and her butler, Toadsworth, on their way to the interestingly-shaped Tropical Paradise of Isle Delfino for a well-deserved vacation. However, all is not well, there is a Mario look-alike (or Shadow Mario if you will...) running amock and polluting the island with some strange kind of paint-like goop coming from what appears to be a big paintbrush in his hand. After the plane lands on Delfino Airstrip, Mario finds the only thing that can help him in his quest to rid the island of this problem, F.L.U.D.D (Flash Liquidiser Ultra Dousing Device), which was created by Gadd Science Inc. (Professor E. Gadd). After cleaning up the airstrip, two Pianta (Natives) officers arrest Mario and sentence him to clean up the whole island! He soon finds out that the Island's main source of power, the Shine Sprites have all dissappeared and he must find them all and return the island to it's former beauty... It won't be an easy task, but nothing worthwhile ever is!! Overall, this is an awesome game. I rented it and I already beat the final boss. Since it's a Mario Game, you already know it's gonna be a sloberknocker. The gameplay is pretty much like Super Mario 64. The moves are exactly the same, you collect coins, and instead of collecting 120 power stars, you collect these things called Shine Sprites. (You'll find out what they are soon enough...) Even if you never played Super Mario 64, no need to worry, you'll be doing backflips and wall kicks in no time at all. Super Mario Sunshine is Mario's first Gamecube release that he can call his own. The graphics are phenominal, gameplay rules, however, there is only one flaw, the final boss battle was too easy. (I won't spill the info on who you fight and when...) Even though it won't change the face of gaming like Mario 64 did, it is a good game to have.  If I was to rate this game on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 9. If the final boss was a little more challenging, it would've been perfect. Enough conversation, GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!	1
Super Mario Sunshine was the most anticipated game of Summer 2002. There is a good reason for this. It's Mario! Super Mario Sunshine is a excellent third person adventure game. It is not for all, just for some who are intrested in the wacky kind of gameplay. Mario goes to Isle Delfino for a vacation. An imposter Mario paints the island with graffiti. When people recognize Mario as the criminal, he is sentenced to cleaning the island, and cannot leave until it is cleansed of the filth. Mario is only given the FLUDD, a water cannon that shoots out water. Mario learns that the source of energy on Isle Delfino are these Shine Sprites. This game is very difficult, and builds on what Super Mario 64 made 6 years ago. This is the most unique Super Mario game released in his 20 year life span. The game has difficult controls, but grow on you. A Button is used to jump, B button is the Action button, Y is used for first person shooting of the water cannon, and X button is used for switching for water shooter, to hovering. In Super Mario Sunshine, shines are the equivilant of Super Mario 64's stars. You need to collect 120 shines throughout Isle Delfino. To every great game, they're always some flaws. Super Mario Sunshine is one of those games. There are only 8 worlds. The one that gets me so mad that I stop playing sometimes is the damn camera. If you have played Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, you know what I'm talking about. The camera is made for you to use, and not for the game to control itself. You have to use the L Button and C stick to control the camera. There are some levels that it gets so out of control, I feel like calling Nintendo's number and complain to stop production of Super Mario Sunshine, and do not put out another copy until they fix the camera. They is one level called Gelato Beach. You have to collect 8 red coins to beat the level. You have to climb a fence that you can punch to get to the other side of it, a la Super Mario World from Super Nintendo and Gameboy Advance. The camera gets stuck behind the fence, and you see water running down the wall, and the camera is trying to get behind Mario, and when you try to jump, the camera keeps moving to get behind Mario, and it makes it impossible to complete your tasks. After attempting to jump off a wall 10 to 20 times, it gets very frustrating. Sometimes, the camera gets in the way, that when you are behind a wall, the camera tries to get behind Mario, and the camera goes through the wall, and you can't see. Super Mario Sunshine is what I said before, for some, not for all. ...	1
there have actually been times when the thought of a new mario game has made me yawn.  zippedy-do-da, it's a new mario game, methinks!  he's been given more jobs than the mob, and has appeared and in more games than mega man and lara croft together.  so i ask myself, "what is there to get excited about?"   and i don't know why, because every time that mario finds himself in the brouhaha that is his virtual life, i find myself enjoying every minute of it!  the graphics are good, but aren't the best you'll see these days, and the story is ho-hum, but these things are expected for mario...as is exceptional gameplay.   besides the beginning of the game, you'll have a choice to embark on many different adventures in the order you see fit.  along these adventures, mario will collect "shines", which brighten the island, and be able to open other locations on the island.  the play control feels a lot like super mario 64, which is a good thing since super mario 64 was the epitome of what a good 3-d game should be, but it doesn't play exactly like it's daddy.  right away mario gains a talking waterhose(surprise) that adds a whole new factor in how objectives are met.   one very pleasing surprise was the difficulty...some things are easy, and others are incredibly hard.  the learning curve is pretty good, depending on what order you do everything in, so this game has something for everyone.  the end duel wasn't as challenging as i would have liked, but the road to perdition getting there more than makes up for it!  getting all the shines is the equivalent of fighting off muggers - you're beat up and weary, but stand proudly...and have the proof to back it up!   yes, this game is very challenging at times, but there is something for everyone to enjoy in mario's vacation hijinks.  besides some comic mischief and animated violence(saturday morning style), mom and pop can relax and the older crowd is sure to love yet another mario game...a very good thing!	1
This game is good for the most part.  Massive 3-D levels with various tasks to complete in each level.  Mario can spray enemies with his spray gun and he can also float using his super hover nossel.  My only complaint would be minor control issues and quirky views.	1
This is the one game that proves you can make a dumb story line, strange concept, and annoying bunch of character and still manage to make it fun enough for people to play.  SMS isn't a bad game.  It borrows some elements from Mario 64 for a new adventure.  But I wish there weren't all those dumb green blob dudes that you would have to talk to.  This is a fun game though, but not for everyone.  So rent it 1st.	1
Mario, such a popular name in the world of gaming, and he doesn't disappoint in his games, never has probably never will, and this game doesn't disappoint either.  If you like Mario 64 you'll love this definate purchase for any 'cube owner.  Now, graphics run at a steady 30FPS (Frames Per Second), which isn't bad, and should have been at 60, but it isn't what the critics wanted, trust me this game does not look like Mario 64 like some of the fanboys have been saying, it runs smooth and is pretty to look at.  Yes, Nintendo could have done better as far as texture surfaces go, they do become a bit pixel like, but I don't complain about it, I'm enjoying every second of this game, and I don't want to stop until I have every single Shine.  Gameplay, 5 stars, good solid and fun.  Controls, well I will say since I haven't played Mario 64 in a while I was out of practice and fell to my death a few times, but with a little time I was up to par and figured my way around everything.  The device on his back, FLUDD, really threw me for a loop at first, I found myself shooting the opposite ways of enemies and got frustrating, but soon I got the hang of it.  All in all, soild game and Mr. Miyamoto doesn't disappoint with his masterpiece, can't wait for the next one, keep up the fantastic work Nintendo!	1
For Mario fans out there, the wait is over.  Super Mario Sunshine gives the system and fans out there what they wanted, Mario for the GameCube.  The game play is exactly the same as Super Mario World 64 and the plot is very similar, requiring you to gather shines instead of stars.  Unless I'm mistaken the game to me appears too short, which is why it only gets 4 stars.  I've had it for less than a week and I'm already fighting the boss.  Either I'm extremely good or the game is short, however, the game is totally worth the buy and has lots of replay.  Although you don't need to collect all the shines to get to the boss, trying to get them all can be fun and frustrating all in one.  Overall this game is great and should be on everyone's must get list.	1
For the first time a videogame has left me with nothing to complain about. The control is perfect and the new water cannon just serves to add to Mario's incredable collection of previous moves. The graphics are positively beautiful and are loaded with little touches here and there to add to the beauty. One such detail is since it's so warm in the game when you're outside and look in the distance it ripples with that heat wave effect just as it would in real life. If you already own a Gamecube buy this game you won't regret it! If you don't, buy one and this game, you won't regret it either (especially later when more Nintendo Gems like this one start hitting the shelves).	1
SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE IS A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF MARIO ADVENTURE. DESPITE WHAT SOME HAVE SAID ABOUT IT BEING TO CLOSE TO MARIO 64. SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE STANDS ON IT'S OWN TWO FEET AS BEING TRULY UNIQUE AND DECIDABLY HAVING IT'S OWN ORIGINALITY THAT PEEKS THROUGH FAMILIAR TERRITORY. WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME MY EYES AND EARS WERE PLEASED. THE GRAPHICS AND SOUND ARE PERFECTION. AND SO FAR THE STORY IS INTERESTING. OF COURSE THE GAMEPLAY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR OVER ALL. VERY EASY TO CONTROL, USER FRIENDLY. YOU DO ALL THE THINGS YOU LOVE TO DO IN A 3D MARIO ADVENTURE. RUN, JUMP, SWIM, FLIP, PICK UP ITEMS, HOVER AND MORE. IF YOU WERE AMONGST THOSE THAT DIDN'T CLICK WITH LUIGI'S MANSION, THIS IS THE GAME YOU WANTED. SCORES: GAMEPLAY(5.0)GRAPHICS(5.0)SOUND(5.0)REPLAY(5.0)STORY(5.0)OVER ALL(5.0)	1
because this game has one thing about it that i hate, and that it the annoying banging and clanking of the MECHS as they walk around. other than this it is a really cool game. i must admit i was a little skeptical at first but i said "oh what the heck" so i bought it today at GameStop and don't regret it. the gameplay is pretty cool, the best thing is that the A.I. MECHS will assist you if you are in trouble (great feature), this gives the game mega points. i will admit that if you play against the A.I(computer) you will pay the price. they are pretty powerful until you get right up on them. also the missions are pretty easy so this makes the game less stressful. overall, i like this game a lot because it is different. i bought Gun Metal(3.75/5) for XBOX and it has nothing on AC3. so my advice is that if you are a MECH fanatic you need to buy it.	1
I bought this game today. I've been playing it for about 2 and a half hours. It is a truly great game. However it is NOT better than Super Mario 64, but i really didn't expect it to be. It is a lot different. I'm sure you know all about the water cannon. There is a story line to this game, but it would of been just as good without it. It has bright colors just like other mario games. There are classic characters. This is the first time that mario is not rescuing peach. The boss battles are one of the strongest points to this game. You can now talk to the people in town and in other places. There are a ton of mini games to get blue coins and shines with (the replacement of stars.) That is about all I can tell you at this point, but it is a must buy.	1
This game has next to no flaws in it. The first flaw I found is the controls are a little bit too complicated for a Mario game (ie: <,>, A to do a spuer jump and rotate Joystick and press A for tornado jump). The other minor flaw is that the camera angle often shifts at the worst times making you send Mario in the wrong direction (very, very annoying). Other wise the game is great. The Plot? Mario travels to the tropical Isle Delfino in search of a long awated vacation. When he arrives, he finds someone who looks exactly like Mario has been spreading sludge and grafiti all over the tropical paradise. The local police mistakeingly arrest Mario. Now, in order to clear his name and be freed from prison, Mario must clean up the mess and catch the Mario imposter. The graphics are beautiful in this game and there are no skips in framerate. The camera angle is fully movable by the player (although it will automatically move itself to how it thinks you want it.... annoying) and the controls are smooth. Despite the somewhat complicated controls, you will grow used to them after about 15-30 min of gameplay. The game isn't a short one (by short I mean I didn't complete it in 2-3 hours) and the gameply becomes addicting. Want a more specific description? Remember Super Mario 64? The controls, gameplay, almost everything was based off what they did in that game only it has been improved to GC standards. If you liked Super Mario 64, you will love this game.	1
MARIO, is BACK in full flow.  The new adventure is something fantastic.  Big worlds, and all kinds of fun, hidden objectives.  Mario took a six year vacation, and now, the day of release, he's back in a game which, takes a little getting used too.  The water pack, I've got to admit is a new type of concept and carried out extremely well.  the camera is a little lost, but then again...  IT'S A MARIO GAME FOLKS.  AND THE BEST ONE AT THAT!	1
Disney may make a bad Mickey Mouse cartoon, Warner Bros. may drop the ball on Bugs, and Sega certainly punted with Sonic Adventure 2; but Nintendo cuts no corners when it comes to Mario adventurres. Super Mario Sunshine is not just a Mario game--al a Mario Golf, Mario Tennis, Paper Mario, Mario Party--it is a Mario adventure--the first new Mario adventure in seven years. Other games may be made by outside teams and released with minimal fanfare, but Nintendo makes Mario adventures in house and releases them in big ways. As the heir to Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine has a lot to live up to. It almost succeeds. In Super Mario Sunshine, Mario travels around a tropical island challenging sludge monsters and cleaning grafitti with a high-tech pressure washer/jetpack that he wears on his back. The idea of Mario using such an instrument takes some getting used to, but it's well-executed in the game and works. In fact, almost everything in this game is done to perfection. The storyline, Mario on vacation getting blamed for pollution and grafitti while an oily imitator kidnaps Princess Peach, also works. Even FLUDD, the pressure washer/jetpack device, proves fun. To this point, Nintendo must be congratulated. Super Mario Sunshine combines keeps the precision jumping, the exploration, and the collecting elements in tact while adding an entirely new style of gaming. But this is also where Super Mario Sunshine runs into a little trouble. The game is hard. Really hard. We're not talking Super Mario Bros 2 (Doki Doki Panic) "where do I find the hidden door" hard. We're not talking Super Mario Bros. 3 "...! He never flies quite far enough" hard. We're talking hard. Beating this kind of game brings its own badge of honor. But something that does not bring honor is 3D camera problems--and Super Mario Sunshine has significant camera placement problems. The camera is always getting stuck behind walls and cliffs. You can control it manually; but with games this hard, you probably want to concentrate on playing, not photography. Nintendo and everybody else in video games should be strapped to a chair and forced to play the first half of Jak and Daxter. Say what you like about the game's derrivitive format, Naughty Dog's intelligent camera was brilliant. And Super Mario Sunshine--this game has a solid concept and Nintendo has done a great job of polishing the final product. This is not a game for kids or newbies, but it's a very solid game.	1
MArio is back in the latest gamecube adventure.  You all probably know about the story.  But a part of the story tat you don't know about is that the pollution is causing monsters to form.  The game is not a other MArio 64 clone.  You use a water pump to kill enemies.  Just because it's 3d doesn't mean it's the same.  It's even funner than MArio 64.  I'm even more excited about this than Zelda (GC).   I'm also sick of these people who have never played it give it one star.  One of them said that it was the same as mario 64.  But if you have ever plaed it then you will tell it's kind of familiar but  also alot different.  If you have a Gc and you don't wanna get GC, why did you get GC?	1
Mario has been a classic and famous character since the begining of Nintendo Corp. I have played all games of him since the launch of the NES and I simply love him (his games). Finally the Gamecube version will arrive, and its looking good. Check all of its features below: - It is the first Mario game in which you won't have to save the Princess. - It takes place on a tropical island, far from the mushroom kingdom. - Mario decides to take a well deserve vacation after being held as a painting in Luigi's Mansion. But unfortunately, his vacation will turn out to be a new adventure for him to kick some butt. - Mario uses an H2o machine on his back to spray water, throw bubbles, use water pression to float in the sky like a jet-pack, and much more. - For the first time, Mario will be able to do his famous tornado (seen in Super Smash Bros. Melee) - Also for the first time, Bowser won't bother you!... maybe (believe it or not, there is a possiblity for a Bowser appearance. Can it be true?) - Collect Sunshine coins - Triple jump, jump, swim, bounce of walls, butt-stomp enemies, and more. - NO KOOPAS ARE SHOWN IN THE GAME!!!!!! (I am just clearing something that another reviewer wrote) - Solve lots of puzzles. Overall the title seems worth it. If you put me to choose between this game and Star Fox Adventures, I would prefer Star Fox for just a bit, but come on, pre-order them both. Pre-order it NOW!!... or wait for Fox Mcloud to hit the cube!	1
I have always loved Mario games, right back to the arcade games of the 1980's. I got hold of a demo copy of "Super Mario Sunshine", and got some extensive play out of it. Judging from most of the reviews here, I may be the first one. Overall, it is quite good. The graphics are amazing, and the controls are very responsive. People who liked Super Mario 64 will find a lot of familiar territory, with enchanced graphics, but the same 3D environments. What I loved was the fluid animation, which makes it the most life-like Mario to date. As you would expect, the game is very colorful and cute in some areas. All the Mario characters you know and love are here: Mario, Luigi, Koopas, annd those Bob-ombs. Super Mario Sunshine showcases the best of the Gamecube, from it's graphics, music, and control. From what I have played, it is an amazing game, and one that should be the standard for every Gamecube. No doubt, it is the one game that GC owners have been waiting for forever.	1
Super Mario Sunshine is a EXCELLENT game to play on the Nintendo GameCube game console because if have GREAT GRAPHICS on this game made by: Nintendo of American I give it 5 Stars "Highly Recommended" This game REALLY WORTH IT TO BUY AND PLAY on your Nintendo GameCube Nintendo of American makes great games (Keep the great job up)	1
Mario finally returns to the world he once ruled in Super Mario Sunshine. This is the unofficial sequel from his last outing by himself since 1996! Mario Party, Mario Golf, and Mario Tennis do not count. The graphics put the Cube's graphic processor to the maxinum. The contraption on his back is a water gun which squirts out water(duh)to take out paint and a bunch of other stuff. Shigeru Miyamoto(creator of Mario)says the plot is about Mario and Princess Peach travel to an exotic island where Mario is falsely accused of painting grafitti on walls and our hero must wash the paint off the walls and find out who did this horrible crime... He can do double jumps and triple jumps off walls like a hot tamale. Looks Luigi will be put back into the shadows after Mario's brand new adventure comes out.	1
A good game, great graphics and control, still love my PS2, the manual is detailed on it's instructions so it's good to read it	1
For those of us who do not get into the techno jargon and play games for their entertainment value this game is endless funnnnn. I have been playing it off and on for almost 10 years and there are always new ways to try things and new combinations of tactics and weopons kinda like Sonic Drive in's they have 180,999 (estimated) drink combinations. This game has about that many tactical and weapons combinations. You can build an AC that is like and impregnable mountain or one that is light as a feather and can fly almost indefinately and avoid most things thrown at it with its quickness. This game is fun and the possibilities are built in you don't have to just beat up all the bad guys and say "was that it"? "is that it"? That is a slap in the face to people who work hours and hours creating all those possibilities and options that are built in to this game. Great Job	1
The game ain't to bad, yet.  I only put in 4-5 hours.  The game plays a little slow.  I can't under stand why they don't let you use the right analog stick for looking around.  The mission are pretty esay in the beginning, but quickly pick up.  The learning curve is average.  That means "good".  I'm still waiting to see some all out, guns a blazen', war.  Oh well.  The bottom line, a good rental.  Indifferent on the purchase.  Hope it helps.	1
This game is GREAT. If you like games that last long and never lose their playability. Then buy this game. Great plot and deep involvment. An AC is a giant mech that has various parts for each body part. Head, arms, core(body), generator, radiator, FCS, Legs, Booster, Back unit left, extension, inside, back unit right, back unit left and back unit right. And there are lots of parts for each category. You can have your own customized Armored Core. Basically when you start out, you need to gather lots of credits so you can buy better stuff. Then there is an arena, you fight other AC's. Missions that affect the course of the game. And extra arena (2v2). Plus you can have a 2v2 if u have 2 tv's 2 ps2's 2 copies of AC3 and a link cable. Which is realllllly fun. So, don't look at anymore games. Buy this one! And hope Silent Line (Sequel to AC3) comes out soon. More parts missions and etc. We need this game to get online too. It would be the best experience of anything. It already is in Japan. JUST BUY THIS!	1
This game is one of the better games for the ps2. The game is long, by my standards fun and filled with great missions. There are lots of ways to look at this game. First is to look at it as a shooting game, now lets face it, even the guys who think there to good for the shoot em up games like a little bang in a game. Second is as a RPG (Role Playing Game) that's right RPG, the fact is that you are playing the role of a mercenary working for companies to complete missions so in that since it is an RPG. Last is a strategy game, this game is big on customized AC's so the need for some strategic since is key to being victorious. However even though I said that this game can really make things blowup, which it can, it does not mean that it is all shooting. If you are one of the gamers that enjoys nothing but games that are nothing but shooting and blood then this is NOT the game for you.   I will quickly give an overall rating (1-20) of the game. Graphics  19 Not as smooth as it could be but still great Game play  18 Story  14 Music  15 Kind of Corny the mood do not match the music Sound  16 the constant clang of the AC is very annoying Comp. AI  20 The COMPS are much better than you would expect Versus  19 this versus mode can handle 2-4 players Violence  12 (Not included in AVERAGE) they are robots General Play 19 All in all very well done Average  18 This game goes above and beyond most other game of the same style. This game is a exhalent buy for anyone who likes and clean fun game. PS. If this game appeals to you then you will also like Mobile Suit Gundam "Federation VS Zeon" -Nathan (>'.'<)	1
good game	1
I picked up this game about 2 weeks ago at a local game store as a spur of the moment type of thing. What really captured me to buy it was the title and because it said on the back of the case that it was a Sci-Fi Action/Survival Horror game. And I'm a huge fan of the Survival Horror genre. Now, I must say that this game isn't really survival horror unless you count some of the suspenseful creepy music and the very few times the monsters actually do jump out at you. It's more on the Sci-Fi Action side which was fine, but I expected more of a Survival Horror feel to it since it's dealing with creepy aliens. Storyline-wise, it's really great. A cast of very likeable characters, complete with really good voice acting from Lance Henriksen, Clancy Brown and others, all fighting against aliens that are trying to merge every race within themselves to become one. The graphics are good, not bad for it's time. The controls are decent although a little stiff, and the playable character moves kind of clunky. Depending on your preference, the aiming mechanics can be a bad or good thing, because it's set to auto-lock on, which makes it extremely easy to kill enemies instead of trying to manually get a precisive aim on them. But to me, that was a bad thing because there really wasn't much of challenge to that, But for some sections of the levels, as many enemies that pop out at you at once, I'm sure it was a smart decision on the developer's part. Sure, some of enemies become more difficult to kill mid-way during the game, but that shouldn't be a problem if you're stocked up on ammo and health. You can literally find health and ammo pick-ups around nearly every corner of the level. One feature I enjoyed was the ability to upgrade your weapons throughout the game. It's basically just uprgrades that make your weapons deal more damage and fire more then 1 shot at a time. The whole game reminded me of a combination of Dead Space, Aliens (movie), and Mass Effect. Overall, the game is really good, but the gameplay does get repetitive and the variety in aliens are lacking, unless you count the boss battles. If you're into Sci-Fi Action games, and want a game to suit your inner Space Marine needs, I would definetly suggest this game. If you're looking for Survival Horror, don't expect much from this game.	1
Listen I don't buy things unless I am 100% satisfied with them and if I'm not I send them back. With that said when I bought this game I couldn't put it down, I'd dream about it. The level design for a PS2 game were flawless.  This is a true survivor game in ever sense of the word. You start off in your chambers really unaware of what's going on when you realize your ship has been attacked by aliens and you are the only one left on the ship. The story is great! I'd recommend it again and again, but my biggest recommendation would be for it to come out in HD on PS3!!!	1
PEOPLE ARE NUTS THIS GAME SUCKED!!! WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!  THE GRAPHICS WERE TERRIBLE, THE CHARCTERS INTERACTION IS BEYOND STUPID! AND THE CHARCTERS THEM SELF ARE JUST PURE JUNK!  THIS WAS BY FAR THE CRAPPIEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!! AND I PLAY A LOT OF GAMES.  SORRY PEOPLE BUT THIS IS JUST SPACE JUNK! NO GEM'S HERE JUST BARGAIN BARN TRASH!  (PASS IT BY)!!! AND RUN LIKE HELL!!!!	-1
This is one of those games that won't stick with you after you've played it, but it's a decent game that has its moments.	1
Finally, a shooter game with a Good story line. I hadn't seen one since Half Life that impressed me until now. To start out with, the graphics in this game are second to none, as well as the voice acting. This game plays out like a good movie, with wonderful background music and a few rock songs in the right places to boot. It'll make you -want- to finish the game and see what happens next. You might even shed a tear or two, I did. The controls are wonderful and add to the enjoyment of the game. The auto-aim helps a lot as well to make the frustration level of RLH go way down, unlike most shooter games. It does get more difficult towards the end, with Aliens you Can't auto-aim at, but over all they did a really great job at keeping this game fun. If you're looking for a good shooter but want to feel like you know the characters your fighting for, this is the game for you.	1
I love Disney games and the like because they appeal to both boys and girls. This game is not too difficult to play. The game lets you know what buttons to push to jump, and do "voodoo" without stopping the game to find the instruction booklet. It's all right on the screen. I had a problem saving my game though, as there aren't many times that you can save your place. Maybe I'm wrong, since the game is fairly new and I may not of discovered everything yet. I liked the movie clips that played throughout. Gives me something to watch till the movie comes out in Dec. Overall, it's fun play.	1
This would be a five star game if it were not for the difficulty of the three different levels the games allows you to play in.  I have owned the game for two weeks and have mastered "Walk-On".  This is the lowest level of difficulty. I was playing Alabama and beating everyone by 28-50 points a game; with over 500 yards of total offense. So I bumped it up to "Starter", the middle setting.  I now lose EVERY GAME by at least 28 points.  Regardless of what play I call, the game calls the play that will beat it.  I think that the programmers should have placed the levels a little closer together.  I would hate to see how bad I would get beaten on "All-American" level.	1
This game is a bit more complex than EA's outstanding title this year--neither one offers Xbox Live support, so they should add it on next year. However, EA's gameplay feels more true and entertaining (for me)--getting started with 2K3 was a bear! But I'm starting to get the hang of it now...just be perpared to practtice ALOT.	1
The game cheats!!!  When you keep burning the computer he just starts making your recievers drop balls.  That is about the lamest thing I have ever seen.  The developers just failed to make a good enough AI to stop your offense to the game just cheats, this is stupid, unrealistic, and completely unnerving.  And what is up with his 3rd down percentage?  Give me a break, I cannot tell how hard it is to stop the computer on 3rd down, it is almost impossible.  I have played a lot of football games in my life and I found NONE to be so unrealistic and infuriating as this one. I really liked the 2k2 version but this game is a piece of junk.	-1
This is some great X-Box football. It looks and plays better than anything else on the market, as this game is truly a marvel in every way. The gameplay is excellent, and it gives you full control. This is easily the best college football game available.	1
I always felt that Yu-Gi-Oh! (specifically the Duel Monsters card game) never translated well to video game format, but Dungeon Dice Monsters was the exception. Because it was played totally differently from the regular card game, it actually worked a lot better as a video game than it did as a tabletop game, and as such I regard this game to be one of the better Yu-Gi-Oh! video games available.  Yu-Gi-Oh! video games never had particularly strong plots- and this one is no exception- but the gameplay is fun enough that it's worth playing through at least once. If you enjoy the format of the dice game, you'll get a decent amount of enjoyment out of this title. Snag it at a cool used price and I'd say it's worth a look.	1
Yu-Gi-Oh: Dungeon Dice Monsters is the 2nd YuGiOh game for the GameBoy Advance(GBA). It is different than the regular YuGiOh card games, but its still fun. In Dice Monsters, you battle various opponents in tournaments and free duels using dice. Dice can be monsters or items. 15 dice are used for each battle. The rules are pretty simple to learn. You choose 3 dice and roll them. If 2 or 3 of them match up with the same number of summon stars, you summon a monter and "dimension"(place) it on the field. Each dice has 6 sides, so even if you don't summon, you can still get attack crests or other ones to use later on. Each monster is a certain type, and has 1 type that its strong against and 1 type its weak against. Very simple to remember, since there is only a few types of monsters in the game. Your goal is to attack the "Die Master" of your opponent, and kill its 3 heart points. To do this, you must summon monsters and build a path to it. There is over 100 dice in the game, and about 100 opponents in all in the game! Opponents are fought in tournaments first, then once you beat them, they are in free duel. In free duel, you can battle them as much as you want. Each win, earns you 1 dice. You can buy or sell dice from Grandpa at the shop at anytime. Once you beat more tournaments, you will unlock more dice to buy at the shop, and even more tournaments will appear. Alot of replay in the game, very fun for YuGiOh fans and non-YuGiOh fans also. Simple rules and pretty fast most of the time. Only downfall is some duels can last a while, the dice rolls are random and it sometimes can take a while to summon the right monsters.	1
This game was my first game for Game Boy Advance and I was very impressed. This game is fun and addicting. But, I can't find a way to pause and the battle things take too long. I also have two words of advice. Number one is turn off the music. It's very irritating and catchy. I played the game for 5 seconds and I had the tune stuck in my head for about 6 hours. Number two is first to read the manual. The game can be very frustrating and complicated.	1
To be truthful the Mega Man X series has started to become disappointing.  Now capcom is giving us a new Mega Man series... but without Mega Man! How could this possibly work? By putting in one of the most loved characters from the Mega Man X series of course! For those who don't know (and I certainly hope you do know this!), Zero was first introduced in the very first Mega Man X way back in 1993.  He has since become one of the most beloved characters in video games and now he gets a game all to himself. Mega Man Zero takes place in the same world as Mega Man X only years into the future where X and Zero are reveered as legends.  But years have passed and Zero seems out of comission.  He's later found by Ciel, who makes him operational again.  Now questions arise such as where X might be.  Not only that but X is presumed to be evil and up to no good. Now Zero is going to find out. Mega Man Zero doesn't present any different gameplay for the Mega Man veteran.  Its the same 2-D sidescrolling that Mega Man fans have grown up with.  But this is NOT an easy game.  Mega Man Zero is perhaps one of the hardest GBA games I've ever played... and I'm a Mega Man veteran.  You select a level to go to just like past MM games.  You battle through each level mauling through enemies until you get to the boss. The game is a little different than other Mega Man games, however. For example, Zero ONLY gets a Z-Sabre and his arm cannon.  He doesn't get abilities from bosses like Mega Man did.  But his weapons do level up.  For example his arm cannon (called a Z-Buster) begins with only firing one shot at a time.  As his weapon levels up he'll be able to fire four shots and even charge up.  He also gets different kinds of weapons such as the triple rod or a shield boomerang. Mega Man Zero also throws in a few other twist.  The game now has "Cyber Elfs" which are given to you by defeating certain enemies or you have to find them.  There are over 70 Cyber Elves in the game and they give Zero remarkable abilities.  Some restore his health... others slow down enemies.  The creators also made it so that once you use the Elf, it's gone.  This teaches you to use strategy. That's not all the gameplay offers.  The game also throws in some twist with the levels. Not everyone is "go for the goal".  Some levels require you to beat it in a certain time, or reach certain objectives.  You may also find a wounded ally and have to help him by taking him back to the beginning of a level once you beat the boss.  So the game certainly isn't boring. Mega Man Zero also looks and sounds BRILLIANT!  A GRAND looking game, no doubt.  For the GBA these graphics are top notch and the music definitely reminds some of Mega Man X.  The games looks smooth and just wait 'til you see the detail on the bosses.  The game just looks incredible! The game does have its drawbacks however.  The biggest problem is of course that its too hard for younger gamers.  This game is NO cakewalk as it will take you the better half of the day to master it.  The other problem is that its too short.  The game can be completed in a day if you really work at it. My last gripe is the control scheme.  It takes time to get used to the controls for this game considering a HUGE emphasis is put on the shoulder buttons.  It takes a moment to get used to (especially if you're playing on your SP since those shoulder buttons are small). Mega Man Zero is an incredible game to behold.  Any fan of the Mega Man X series should pick this up and give it a try, this is a GBA game to own! The Good +Amazing Graphics +Great Sound +Zero gets his own game now! +Improved gameplay +Classic Mega Man gaming! The Bad -HARD Game.  Newcomers will have LOTS of trouble -Too Short -Control Scheme takes time to get used to	1
Please take note about some people saying the game is hard. It doesn't necessarily mean it will be hard for you. If you're use to megaman, than getting use to zero would be simple. The game, in my opinion, was fun, challenging at the early stages until I upgraded and become too powerful for my own good, and simple and easy to understand. Finding the elfs is fun and simple, the game play is fun and simple, simple as that. That is why this game is so effective and successful in my opinion of "great games". If you're tired of tedious item finding and objective completions, than this game would help. Releave your stress and have fun, thats what games are for, not to frustrate you more. This game can be more difficult if you don't use the elfs, it is possible to win but to many, its hard. Play this game well, because part 2 adds slight frustrations, you'll see. And once again, don't play a game that frustrates you and makes you want to bash your system. Play a game that is challenging, but simple, clear, and fun. Thats what games are for. Enjoy your day and I hope this helps.	1
Mega Man Zero is the third Mega Man game released for the Game Boy Advance, and like the other two, it's a departure from the roots of the series--only less so. The previously released Mega Man Battle Network games are role-playing games rather than the sorts of platform shooting games that Capcom's famous blue hero is best known for. Meanwhile, this latest game doesn't even feature Mega Man at all. However, Mega Man Zero is a platformer through and through, and fans of the series will be instantly at ease with the game and its new features. And they're likely to be struck not just by Mega Man Zero's great graphics and design, but also by its challenge. Mega Man Zero takes place far in the future of the Mega Man X storyline, when characters Zero and X have come to be known as legendary reploids. X is nowhere to be seen and is believed to have turned evil and to be up to all sorts of evil affairs. Zero, on the other hand, is found abandoned and nonoperational in a mine by a young scientist named Ciel, who awakens the famous reploid in an attempt to save the world from all its problems. From here, you take control of Zero to protect Ciel in the initial stage of the game. The game follows the traditional formula of nearly every Mega Man game that has come before it. From the beginning, you'll have the usual mega buster cannon to shoot foes as well as your z-saber as your primary weapons. Later in the game you'll also wield new weapons, such as the triple rod and the shield boomerang. What sets Mega Man Zero apart from previous Mega Man games is that now you can level up your weapons simply by using them during the game. For instance, the mega buster starts out being able to shoot only in three-shot bursts, but after a few levels, you'll be able to shoot four shots at a time, as well as charge up your weapon for a more devastating blast. While the weapons are easy enough to get a handle on, the controls require a bit more practice. You press the A button to jump, press the B button to attack with your primary weapon, press and hold the right shoulder button and B to use the secondary weapon, and press the L button to dash. Because Mega Man games, this one included, tend to always require a firm grasp of just about every move at your disposal, getting used to the control scheme is a little problematic at first, particularly the secondary-weapon command. As you fight your way through the game, you'll find a brand-new addition to the series in the form of the "cyber elf" system. Throughout each and every level, Zero will find these cyber elves by eliminating enemies, or he'll find them tucked away in hidden areas. Upon successfully besting the level and returning to base, you can then take a look at what your newly found cyber elf can do for you. There are more than 70 different elves to collect and bring to life, each with different abilities, such as slowing down enemies, damaging boss characters, and refilling Zero's health. To make matters a little more interesting, after you put an elf to use, it disappears. This requires you to think carefully about using some of the more powerful ones that you'll come across. Longtime fans of Mega Man games are undoubtedly familiar with the method of picking which level to proceed to next by selecting its boss character from a central screen. Mega Man Zero adjusts this system by putting you back at base in between missions, where you can move around and speak to other members of the resistance, select a new mission, or save your game by speaking to Ciel. The actual levels in the game are a little different from the typical side-scrolling or vertical-scrolling Mega Man level, although they're still rooted in that style. In one case, you make your way through a level like you normally would, fighting a boss at the end, but afterward you have to escort an injured ally back to the beginning of the level. Other levels are timed, and some are slower paced. No matter how you look at it, there is a great deal of variety to the missions in the game. Mega Man Zero also happens to be one of the most difficult games to come around for the system in a while. It's so hard, in fact, that those unfamiliar with the series may find themselves completely unable to get very far in the game at all. Mega Man Zero requires you to be on your toes at all times and, most importantly, to be able to recognize patterns in enemy movement easily and use them to your advantage. In addition to the sheer difficulty of the game, Zero also has only one life at a time, so if you die during a level, you'll be forced to use a continue. Fortunately, extra continues can be stockpiled by killing various enemies. However, extra time spent in a level will lower your rating for that level, so you'll have to put on a real show to get the highest score. The game is surely difficult, but nevertheless, it's still one of the better platformers yet to grace the small screen. The Mega Man series once was known for its beautiful 2D graphics, and this game is a reminder of why. Zero is very detailed and fluidly animated, and every one of his moves is hand-drawn to perfection. The game's levels and enemies are also quite detailed, especially the huge boss characters, which can sometimes take up half of the screen and have multiple death animations depending on the weapon you use to defeat them. In a day and age when 2D bitmapped graphics have all but become a lost art, this game shows that drawing every detail by hand still pays off. Simply put, this is one of the best-looking Game Boy Advance games out there. In addition to having beautiful graphics, the game also sounds great. The musical accompaniment hearkens back to the days of the SNES, when the Mega Man X games were popular. Anyone who has played a modern Mega Man game before will fall in love with the new songs in Mega Man Zero. Overall, Mega Man Zero is an impressive action game that definitely isn't for everyone. Younger or more casual players may find the game way too hard and may be better off with something less difficult. However, fans of the series or experienced gamers should not hesitate to pick this one up. While the Game Boy Advance still doesn't have a traditional Mega Man game starring Mega Man himself, Mega Man Zero will definitely provide you with more than enough challenge to keep you busy until then.	1
Megaman Zero is a weird type of megaman game. see it has some odd parts like you don't start out with the Z-Saber instead you must find it. You also start out with a buster like the X-buster but it looks like a gun. Zero dousn't even look like Zero and yet they still say it is. Zero does not have a buster like X even in X5 when Zero gets an arm cannon it still doesn't look like that.but overall its a hard megaman game. The bosses have lost of life and you don't have much so that makes it hard. but the bosses stratagies suck even I could beet the final bosses first form in one try annd he had a lot of life. but overall this is one of the most challenging games ever a defenent must buy. But I give it 4 stars because of its odd grafics.	1
Yu-gi-oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters is a AWESOME game to play on the Nintendo GameCube I give it 5 Stars "Highly Recommended" really TOTALLY WORTH it to buy & play this game on your Nintendo Advance game system	1
this game has some downs like graphics how long and the complication every thing else is good	1
When I first tryed this game I was expecting it to be alot better, but i still found it pretty good. The graphics are very good. The few reasons why one star is that Personaaly i don't like the story. And the other reason is that you die pretty easily unles you have things called cyber elves to get it higher.  ...	1
I've been a fan of the Mega Man series since the first. I've played and replayed them with much love for each one. However, I must admit I missed a few after the X series debut. So, when I heard Zero was the sequel to X6, I figured now was a great time to get back into the game. With the recent success of Metroid Fusion, I knew the GBA was up to the challenge hardware wise for a SNES quality game. All that remained to see was if the game itself was on par or just another sequel. Zero brings many welcomed changes, as well as a few unwelcomed ones. First off, you now play as the incredible Zero. While Mega surely has a place in the hall of fame for nearly every long term gamer, Zero is one amazing character. The way he moves, dashes, jumps, and slices enemies in half with his saber is incredible and a lot of fun. The elves system looks questionable at first, but as you play you'll realize just how handy the little guys are. Another change I love is all of Zero's weapons are limitless. Mega had some incredible powers, but what good were they when you couldn't use them? However, one thing that bugs me is the way the powers are dealt. You gain ability from mere usage, and many of the game's big upgrades (health, speed, damage, defense) are dealt through the fairies. This means so long as you go through an old level stomping down low life enemies, you'll quickly gain too much strength and like many RPGs, have too much power. I much prefer finding abilities as the missions progress, which rewards exploration over repeat killing of enemies. At the very least, low level enemies should have stopped giving skill increases and crystals rather quickly to force the player to move on. Even so, it doesn't hurt the game all that badly. Bosses will still be tough, levels will still be hard. It's not the end of the world, it's just annoying that a good idea could have been done better. Moving on though, the graphics are every bit as good as you'd expect. They look SNES quality, and are filled with detail. Zero moves smoothly, and the enemies destroy better than ever. It's very satisfying to literally chop them in half with the Z-Saber. Mega Man Zero has one of the better stories that I can remember. They all had their stories... but Zero actually makes you a bigger part of it. There's characters to talk to, choices to make, etc. The story is actually quite good and should be enough to satisfy. You're not going to be on the edge of your seat, but it'll at least let you know why you're where you are and what you're fighting for. That's all I ask. Overall Zero seems to be a long game, filled with plenty of action and some good storylines to boot. The sound is good, the graphics are great, and Zero makes for a refreshingly fun main character. If you're a Mega Man fan, you should definitely check this one out. Even if the recent games have turned you off from the sheer number of sequels, you might find this one a much needed breath of fresh air. The Mega Man series still lives, and it's going strong. - Rirath_com	1
Mega Man Zero is, simply put, one of the best Mega Man games to come out in years.  With a fresh, new look, fun gameplay, and extremely crisp animation, I'm anxiously hoping they will make a sequel! Mega Man Zero takes place in the year 22XX, presumably within a century after the X series ended.  It stars Zero, an android, who was Mega Man X's comrade in arms back then.  Zero was reactivated by a human scientist, named Ciel, who needed his legendary powers to defeat a new threat.  That threat comes in the form of Neo Arcadia, an oppressive government regime that has ordered the destruction of all Reploids, worker androids based X and Zero.  The identity of the mysterious leader of Neo Arcadia provides a very surprising and fascinating plot twist for those who have followed the X series. The gameplay is fast and furious.  If you ever played as Zero in the X games, you'll have a general idea of what to except.  Zero is equipped with a gun and a sword to begin with, although you will find the latter far more useful.  Eventually two other weapons can be earned and each of them can be joined with the Elemental powers won by defeating the bosses.  The game controls perfectly and Zero's animations are incredibly smooth, even when compared to the PSX games.  They really nailed the graphics in this game.  The music and sound is less memorable. The game is hampered by a couple negative points worthy of mention. First, the game presents you with the Cyber Elf system.  Through this system, you can upgrade Zero, give him energy tanks, and in general make the game a lot easier.  The problem with this system is that to use Cyber Elves, you not only have to find them in the levels, but also gather up enough energy for them to reach their full potential.  With some taking upwards of 1200 points, you'll find yourself standing in the Underground Lab stage hitting those spider robots for hours.  This is just bad design.  If a player wants the item granted by the Cyber Elf, it is already at their option to use it or not.  If they want to use it, don't put this artifical hurdle in their way.  If they want an item bad enough, they are going to sit there and gather the energy to do it, so why not just let them have it? The second point is the difficulty.  The game has a slightly wacky difficulty level in that it is harder in the beginning than it is towards the end.  That's because when you use the aforementioned Cyber Elf system, you will gain items that make things a lot easier.  Until then, the first two or three bosses are going to be very difficult.  Indeed, the whole concept of giving Zero one life to get through a level and limited continues is just harsh and will easily frustrate the casual gamer.  In the future, Capcom should bring back the original lives and unlimited continues premise.  At least, after you beat it, you can start over again with all of your weapons and upgrades.  The bosses, once you have the means of defeating them, are a joy to fight again, mostly because they are so original in both design and attack strategy. Even with these problems, Mega Man Zero is still an awesome game.  Capcom really outdid themselves with this one, creating a game that easily rivals the past two Playstation Mega Man titles.  If you are looking for a fine Game Boy Advance game you won't defeat in a couple hours, try this one.  I would recommend this to side-scroller fans and especially those who are looking for another game like it after having beaten Metroid Fusion for the fourth time.	1
Mega man Zero is by far the hardest game ever i have played. The game consists of the normal sidescrolling charicteristic that almost all megaman games have had, but adds a whole new twist. you fight AS zero, (the red guy with the sword), and have to defeat megaman, who is destroying all your fellow repliods.   Why is this so diffucult you ask? well besides the confusing part with the cyber-elves (little elves you collect, and use for an effect), the bosses are more difficult, the enemies are fast, and an hour and a half of frustration and soda can lead you to the fruit of your labor, the defeat of level one.   The hardest part of thwe whole game are the bosses. Finding a pattern and escape from all thier attacks isone thing, but actually being able to execute it is another. in this game, there is no such thing as luck	1
Megaman Zero is probably the best games of it's kind. The graphics are outstanding showing the potential of the GBA. Unlike the traditional mega man games the main character cannot obsorb the enemies fire Power making the game alot harder, but you do get cyber elf that bust up your power and help you in tight situations. This game also has and RPG feeling on it. Zero is able to develop and grow in levels,learning new moves, and combos with the weapons. Now the first time you play the game, the bosses seem hard. That will easy go away once you find the patterns and elements that work against them. Over all it's the Best Mega man game out there. It's a must buy.	1
Let me just start off by saying that I have never played a better Game Boy game, nor a better Mega Man game. The introduction of a REALLY powerful sword into a sidescrolling shooter is so out of place is to be AMAZINGLY fun. The satisfaction of jumping over a slow-moving energy shot and coming down and slicing the enemy in half all in the same fluid move is not to be ignored. However, game companies and designers seem to have lost sight of the reason people play videogames: to have fun. Of course, a game that lets you win too easily is no fun, but a game as aggravatingly difficult as Mega Man Zero should be banned. This is the one that will have you flinging your GBA out the window, ladies and gentleman. Let me give you an example: I'm a slightly above average Mega Man gamer, so after taking a few lives to strategise against a boss, I restart the game, and take him on. With only 2 ticks left on my health meter, I decide that I WILL NOT LOOSE, and that I'm going to play the rest of the battle perfectly. I do, and I beat the boss. Then the game says "Oh, you had a brilliant victory and you're almost dead... well now you need to escape from tons of falling stone THROUGH A LOCKED DOOR." What the ... do you think I am, the next Houdinni?? MEGA MAN DOES NOT WALK THROUGH WALLS. In addition to which, one of the first and foremost rules of VideoGame developement is: ONCE YOU BEAT THE BOSS THE LEVEL IS OVER. In a game as frustratingly hard as this, if the level isn't over, a health refill is in order. BTW, for MMX vets, there are no SubTanks in this game. In the end, get the game, but only if you have enough money to replace your GBA Unit when you toss it on the ground and jump on it till it's dust.	-1
THE GOOD: Use zero in a new and inovative levels. Zero has been given a great new look that makes him look younger and more like an anime character, infact everyone you meet gives you that anime feel. Respect...Get a high rank and your fellow resitance members will give you respect and praise you, even enemies will back down, do bad and well.....Lets just say you won't get the respect zero deserves. Intorduction of cyber elves (there kind of like net navis from megaman battle net work)they kind of work like hearts (those things that increased your life) but they have many uses and some can even be leveled up. Great battle effects when you beat an enemy with the saber you will more then likely see that enemy be sliced in two. A great story line will help explain the megaman saga. And lastly think the bosses from the past megaman games were to easy well even the most basic bosses will have more than one life bar (it's not to hard for us veteren megaman players but it will give rookies a run for their money). THE BAD: The game is pretty short ( beat the game in under 5 hours but I've been playing megaman games for a long time and I didn't get every cyber fairy so I guess that could extend game time alot). Only 2 different weapons (sword and gun) but you have 3 different elemental properties to amp up the sword (fire, ice, electric). SUMMARY: Another great addition to the megaman series and in my opinion better than the megaman battle network series. I hope capcom continues to put this anime flare in their megaman and hopefully zero games.	1
i have been a Madden fan since the 16-bit days, but must say that this years Sega game beats it in most ways. contrary to some beliefs, i think 2K3 is a more accurate simulation of the nfl than even Madden's is. and above that, it is simply more fun to play. it's a harder game to master than Madden's is, but when you do master it, it is definitely worth it. only reason i haven't mentioned NFL Fever, is because it is much too easy to score. it's more of an arcade game than a simulation game like the previous two. so if you want the BEST nfl experience for the BEST system, get NFL 2K3 on the XBOX!!	1
I'm not a big football buff or video-game football buff.  But we wanted a game we could play with friends and could play online. This was just the ticket.  It's a great football game for those who might want to play football, but who don't know all the plays and formations.  In fact, it can keep me entertained alone for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon.  With friends or online it is even better. The others may be more realistic, have better plays or in other ways be better for the avid sports buff.  Bit ff you want a football game that's fun, graphically pretty, challenging, can be played online and is fun alone - this is it.	1
One of the most anticipated NFL games of this year has finally come, so after hearing the huge buzz for this game I decided to buy it ... and it was worth the wait!  With the addition of the ESPN license it made the game that much better! This game doesn't take that much getting used to because the controls are so good that every button is in the right place. The menus are one of the best looking and are easy to use because of the ESPN license. The franchise mode is the deepest ever. I can't describe it with words. Just play it and you'll know that the gameplay is outstanding! NFL 2K3 has the best commentary of any sports game. The commentators' lines are barely ever repetitive. The crowd sounds realistic, especially when they chant a player's name. The commentators sound like your watching a live ESPN television show. Also, the grunts of the players sound so realistic that when they get hit, it sounds like he really got hit unlike other games where it sounds a computer's engine is busted.  The graphics in this game are wicked! The faces actually look like their real-life counterpart. The stadiums are beautifully modeled that you might confuse the video game one to a picture of the real-life stadium. You have to see it to believe it! Oh, and the animations for this game are phenomenal! You can tell that Visual Concepts really worked hard to make this game the prettiest ever! This game is the most fun I have had playing a football game because it feels like your playing a game on ESPN, and then seeing it on SportsCenter for the weekly wrap-up. Also the game is Xbox Live compatible, so you'll be playing this game till NFL 2K6! This is the best sport game ever, and I am a basketball fan and was thinking I would just buy this game and wait until NBA 2K3, but I'll be playing this game long after NBA 2K3 comes out. Go pick up this game - it's worth the money. You won't be disappointed.	1
I started out as a fan of the 2k series back on the Dreamcast.  NFL2k was the biggest factor in my decision to pre-order a Dreamcast.  I stayed faithful to the series up until the release of the X-box and decided to give Fever a chance.  I was happy with it, and felt it was the graphical superior of the three football games that launched with the X-box.  Then the second-generation games arrived and I decided to go back to the 2k series, and boy am I glad I did.  NFL 2k3 is the greatest football game to date.  Nothing even comes close to the depth and quality this game possesses.  I rented the big three, Madden, Fever and 2k3 before making my decision.  NFL 2k3 surpasses the competition in almost every aspect.  If you are looking for a deep accurate realistic football game go with NFL 2k3.  The graphics are unreal, the sound and commentary is outstanding, and the depth of the franchise mode is beyond fulfilling.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you have any interest in playing Football on your X-box.	1
Graphics - Incredible Sound - Awesome Announcers - not too annoying. I have the PC version of Madden 2003.  NFL 2k3 rivals the graphics on that game.  The sound on NFL 2k3is far better. The motion could be improved on NFL 2k3.  Occasionally the characters appear to be ice skating across the turf. Further, when on defense, you can run straight through your teammates.  This is just weird.  This is the primary reason I could not give this game a 5. Madden, on the other hand, does a good job of making each player a solid object on the field. Yet madden doesn't seem to provide the variety of animation the NFL 2k3 game provides. With NFL 2k3, on rookie level, you can find bread and butter plays each team can run successfully almost every down.  As you increase the skill level, you almost take the running game out of the mix altogether.  This is the secondary reason I could not give this game a 5. This is definitely a fun game, but if Madden 2003 for xbox is anything like madden 2003 for PC, I suggest you buy Madden 2003.	1
and you all thought Madden was the game 2 get this year due to the deep plays and franchise mode. You thought Fever was the game to get because of the online play. Well, let me tell u something, This game is the #($^ when it comes to football games. Im getting NHL 2K3 when it comes out thanks to this	1
Ok, this is my favorite football series out therer, i own everyone of them from 2k to 2k3, and 2k3 is of course the best.  i will start wit the graphics, the graphics are all around the best of al the football games out there.  The bodies look so much more realistic then earlier football games, and the animations are great,  but te thing that makes the graphics even better are the stadium, WOW, i have been to 10 of the pro stadiums and they look so real, from cheap seats to expensive seats, to the skyboxes and even the construction(lambuea) its a so real.  The sidline deptail like the coaches and the camera crew, all there they didn't leave out a thing, the coaches are nicely done, specialy the expressions. Now onto to the sound. The commentary is all areound good, it can get a bit repetative, especcially in the weekly wrapups, but in-game commentary is probalbly the best out there right now.  The gameplay, o boy the gameplay, the gameplay is so real its scary. from the passing game to the running game, it replicates real forrtball to a point, the best aspect in the game i think.  Now onto presentaions, the presentaion has changed a whole lot, it now replicates and sounds like ESPN, and it couldn't be any better, ESPN was the best idea yet. and the franchise, the franchise is the most in depth franchise i have ever saw, it is so much better than ealier games. and its so much better that madden.  overall this is the best pro ftball game out there, the best ftball game out there rihgt up there along with ncaa 2003...   ((El DiAbLo))	1
This is a good game but it is last in the compition, but it seems like it improves wondefully every year so expect something good in 2003.  Until then, we wait.	1
In past years the 2k series from Sega has dragged a little behind Madden. This year, Madden has fallen. NFL2k3 is the most complete, realistic, and just plain fun football game you can buy. It's head-and-shoulders above Fever 2003, and a significant improvement over Madden 2003. Everything Madden does, NFL2k3 goes one step further. If you love football, NFL2k3 is your game, period. If you doubt, go to any game review web page and read the reviews on both games. I have yet to see Madden outscore NFL2k3.	1
Wow, what a game.  The theme is just stupid cool.  The soundtrack is pleasing.  The gameplay....insanely difficult!  Real tough!  When I went through this game all the way it was on SNES....it took me 4 months on easy!  I had to leave my SNES on for the whole 4 months.  I wish I would have had this gameboy version that lets you save:(  If you like a challenge, this is truely the game for you.	1
What happened? Why is this game so hard? If you can past even the first level, you're gonna have sore thumbs. The Genesis version was actually FUN, this is not. You gotta be some kind of Super Ghouls 'N' Ghosts supreme hardcore gamer to even beat this game. Matter of fact, has anyone even beat this game yet?...	-1
One of my favorite arcade game back in 80s was Ghost and Goblin, the very first installment of the series.  I still remember pouring in countless coins to play that well-made game...  And believe it or not, I'm playing this third installment on GameBoyAdvance..  I have nothing to complain here. Super Ghouls N Ghosts is the remake of Super Nintendo Version of Ghost and Goblin series, where they implemented this infamous double jump.  This game is about timing, your ability to deal with the situation quickly, jumping with your instinct.. And this this double jump, it added much more possibilities, much more moves you can pull out in the game.  They transported this sequel faithfully from Super Nintendo and I had to finish it in couple days.  I had to finish it in couple days because not only I was in for nostalgic mood but also severely addicted to it.  I've been playing games for latest systems yet finding myself putting down controller so easily due to games' lack of genuine game play.. yet this game is so addictive that I had to finish it in couple days..  It really shows what genuine 'gameplay' of a game can pull out time after time. You play this game and you tell me-  Beautifully drawn graphic, more-than-perfect-atmosphere-creating music, intuitive, intuitive control, and challenging game play which still shines after all these years. I happened to have compilation disc for import Sega Saturn, which contains original Ghost N Goblin, Ghost N Goblin 2, and this SNES version.  And trust me, being able to play this third installment before bed time, during break, while walking, it's just priceless- They have included the original version with rearranged version.  Original version does faithfully play like original version. Moreover, rearranged version included this never-been-played-before levels, which is partially from previous Ghost N Goblin series.  That's right, they've included more stages from other installment. I have no choice but to give 5 Stars for Super Ghouls N Ghosts because I'm truly grateful for being able to play this very game on GBA.  Of course, this game does provide you with challenging gameplay because that's the trade mark for Ghost N Goblin series.  I wouldn't want this game to be finished in one sitting and never play it again- I rather play them again and again to finish it and trust me, it's gonna take awhile to figure out the rearranged mode to play those 'new' stages.  Man, I'm in for real treat these days, Super Mario(Yoshi's Island), new Castlevania, and Super Ghouls N Ghosts-  Somebody pinch me! Enjoy it. PS: I love this kind of game; where you make mistake, then you are over. Not that you have health point to be depleted, but every move, every decision to either jump, crouch, move, or attack has to be decided quickly or otherwise you are a dead man.  Man, I wish Capcom would bring out first two series in one gamepack eventually if that's possible-  Either this or that, I welcome the idea of bringing over those classics, just bring'em in!	1
I have played many ps 2 games and this is bad. I can't use the analog stick to move. I have to use the pad. When I use the game pad.. I still can't move in the direction I want to go. Up is not up, more like moving back wards. There is no option to change to the controller stick. Yea, the graphics are great but that is all I will say for this game. I will return back to game stop. I would rate this video game a big 0 if I could. And I love fighting games.	-1
condition of the game is not as they said the condition i'd say the game is in is ok its in between poor and good there are a lot of scratches 3 of them are pretty deep looking and a lot of minor scratches but game somewhat works it does freeze from time to time but for the most part it works ok	-1
Stupid overhyped garbage Confusing plot Confusing story Inviting disney universe & characters into another world Makes no sense at all Confusing series. With games jumping from console to handeld & back to console Messing up the story if you don't play in order Epic fail Confusing & too many factions The heartless The nobodies The guys in the cloaks Who is good? Who is evil? No one knows Why all the keys & the key knights Why the gummi ship? Why the big stupid monstrous bosses?	-1
Like everyone here, I purchased this game because I love the Terminator franchise. Well, I learned my lesson. This game is, without a doubt, the worst 3rd person shooter ever created. The "follow you" camera is so bad that you will find it frustrating just to walk down a straight hallway. In fact, it's so bad that the programmers put in a first person mode (just pull the left trigger) to try and make up for it. They didn't spend enough time on that tho, because you can't move in 1st person mode. -So don't believe the hype they have about being able to switch modes. Worse though (and completely unforgivable) is the save game feature. While in the game, you restart at various "checkpoints" within a level. However, if you save the same and turn off your X-box for the night, you'll find yourself at the beginning of the level. Ugh. Your game isn't good enough to keep us up all night Infogrames! Put some effort into the work you do! And finally, a person rant: who makes shooter games without multiplayer anymore?!? On the plus side, the game makes awesome use of the Terminator world, as you're trying to get to the point where the Terminators go back to kill Sarah Connor. And the unlocking of secrets and the ability to use bonus points to unlock additional technology is awesome. But, if you really want to give this game a try, rent it. You'll be happy to have saved [money] that you can use to go out Saturday night after you've finished the game in your first half of the day.	-1
I rented it last night, and it bites.  The graphics are horrible, and so is the voice acting.  The game isn't even that fun.	-1
Okay, I have to admit, I went into this game with high expectations, leaving me a long way to fall with disappointment, BUT YOU WILL AGREE, this game is BAD.  The concept is cool, you are an American POW in WWII, and you try to escape from your POW camp...cool.  The idea is pulled of poorly however. You start out in a small camp, which actually acts as your game training ground.  You are given tasks from fellow prisoners, all of which lead up to your eventual escape.  "Grab the key, steal the crowbar, steal this," ect.  The first camp lasts awhile and after escaping you are re-captured and put into a new=harder camp.  This will go on and on. The controls are poor, your guy keeps running when you don't want him to, you end up getting shot anf have to start the mission over again.  Gameplay is boring, go here, do this, come back, go out again.  I am a fan of Metal Gear, with all of the sneaking and stuff, but there is no action in this game!  Get spotted, and you are shot down, and NO...you cannot break any necks here.  The voice acting is horrible, with your captors with horrible and cheesy German accents. Be smart, stay away from this, maybe Dead to Rights will be good.  If you need an espionage game, go with Metal Gear.	-1
O.K. When someone gives a game only 1 star - they can sometimes have an agenda.  My only agenda is to inform gamers how dissapointed I was at this game and let the gamer make-up his or her own mind.  I was very excited when I brought POW home and placed the disc in my XBOX.  The intro scene was well done and signalled that CODEMASTERS were capable programmers.  Then I played the game.  The graphics are seriously below par for an XBOX title.  The poor quality of graphics made it impossible for me to forget that I was staring at my 35" SONY instead of having the impression I was back in 1942 in a German POW camp.  If I thought the graphics bad - imagine how I felt when I played the game.  The gameplay is absolutely awful.  MOVEMENT - think Halo for the LEFT THUMBSTICK (which is cool.)  However, for whatever reason, the RIGHT THUMBSTICK only allows you to look left or right - not up or down.  HOWEVER...the values are reversed - to LOOK LEFT requires that you PUSH RIGHT - and vice versa.  I know what your thinking because I thought the same thing - there has to be a menu that allows you to change the polarity of the RIGHT THUMBSTICK - NOPE!  With Halo I was effeciently killing bad guys in no time.  With POW I was taking my frustration out on the innocent XBOX controller within 10 minutes.  Oh, and it only gets worse.  To climb over 1 wall/fence requires you to stand facing the fence.  Then, press the LEFT THUMBSTICK forward and press the A button to jump and grasp the ledge (if a wall) or grab hold of the fence.  Next, press the LEFT THUMSTICK forward once more to climb to the top of the wall or as many times as needed to climb over the fence.  Next, the camera angle automatically swivles 180 degrees - to the other side of the wall/fence.  Now, you must press the LEFT THUMSTICK down once to grasp the ledge and again to drop to the other side.  You cannot imagine how clumbsy this feels.  In the early levels - when guards are not overly aggressive/smart - you can ignore this clumbsy requirement - but later you'll be quite frustrated.  If you press and hold the LEFT TRIGGER you are in FIRST PERSON VIEW ONLY MODE - meaning you can look side-to-side and up-and-down using the RIGHT THUMBSTICK - think Halo's RIGHT THUMBSTICK but without the ability to move when the LEFT TRIGGER is depressed.  Now, you've finally scaled a wall and you stealthily enter a building looking for currency and useful items.  Well, when inside buildings your point-of-view becomes fixed (from inexplicably some of the worst vantage places - without any room-level zooming capability) - and your RIGHT THUMBSTICK becomes useless - until you enter the previously mentioned FIRST PERSON VIEW ONLY MODE by pressing the LEFT TRIGGER.  Useful items/loot twinkle and all you have to do is walk next to the item for it to be placed in your inventory.  However, your instincts will be urging you to perform a thorough search of the room - open a few drawers - well they must not have had drawers in WWII because all you can do is walk around a static room.  So you do just that - but due diligence requires that you walk a few inches enter the FIRST PERSON VIEW ONLY MODE look around for goodies and then walk another few inches enter the FIRST PERSON VIEW ONLY MODE...etc.  You quickly discover that the only loot in the room is what twinkled upon entering - this must mean that Germans don't hide things - interesting?  The inventory management subsystem was poorly conceived.  Anything you cannot fit in your pockets is carried for all to see in your hands.  There are hiding places you can find scattered thoughout the camps and you have a personal footlocker in your barracks.  It took me forever just to figure out how to examine/use inventory items.  Game Saving - you must be in your barracks and next to your bed in order to save your game.  The game designers felt that one of the driving forces behind a prisoner of war game had to be the daily routine that a prisoner was forced to adhere by.  So they devised a lame gimmick - a timepiece - that helps you plan mischeif around static morning and evening roll calls.  So you are allowed to go exploring as long as you do not get caught in a guards vision-cone while in an illegal area as long as you get back to morning/evening roll call.  From the moment I began playing this game I was extremely dissapointed.  After playing for a day - I knew I was going to get rid of the game quickly before word got out.  The graphics are boring.  The character controls are the worst in XBOX history - why do I have to press right to look left - (that infuriates me)?  The idea of being a prisoner of war trying to escape is golden (and I hope someone pulls it off), but this implementation is shameful.  CODEMASTERS quality assurance team should be fired.	-1
I like the idea of a video game based on the movie "The Thing" by John Carpenter, and I was excited to see how they would play on the fear the players had toward eachother- "Is he the Thing? Is She??"  As it turned out the game play was extremely slow moving, and at first the controls and interface were difficult master.  The graphics are a bit dated, and if you walk close to wall, you may get a piece of the other room on screen.  In addition, it really didn't follow the movie at all.  It seemed closer to a sci fi shooter like Cold Fear or Extermination, rather than the mind games I assumed it would contain.	-1
Ok, first of all I never finished the game, but that is because it is so frustrating and boring to the point where you can't possibly finish it without having dreadful thoughts of putting a gun in your mouth. Actually, the thoughts I had of putting a gun in my mouth were much more entertaining than this piece of shiz. I mean seriously, at least if I put a gun in my mouth I get to have complete control of the gun and where the bullet ends up. The latter statement brings me to my main point, and that point being, if I can't control the aiming process of my gun then what am I actually doing? Why do the gaming companies feel like they have to cater to people by implementing a lock on aiming system rather than a manual one. It completely takes the fun out of the entire experience. Whats truly amazing about this game is the fact that even with automatic aim implemented it's still a freaking hard game! So lets backtrack, the game is boring, frustrating, and flat out stupid!	-1
I loved the film. If your a true horror fan you'll know the orignal thing was made in the 50's. As a kid I truly loved it. It was the first time I seen a horror film where it was impossible (almost impossible) to kill the monster. I believe they killed the thing with electrcity in the first one. The John Carpenter remake was awesome, much better then the first original. The game has good graphics & real language, meaning a lot of 4 letter words. If you know anything about the military you know cursing is part of it. Try boot camp..:) But the 4 letter words were really forced. The NPC's just said them for the heck of it. I thought this game would have alot gore & Disturbing images.. It had a few but not impressivly gorey. Most is not realistic looking. Looks more like red paint drippings etc.. The game play is ok. The fear/trust factor is nice but annoying. The AI troops are pretty stupid. I asked my medic to fix & power box & he said he couldn't cause he was blocked. There was another way to get to the power box. Even when I showed him the way he resorted to his pre programed instinks & went toward the path that was blocked. I had to use a gernade to blow up the remaining boxes so he could repair it. The guns & other items you have in the game are nice. I wish they had a more diverse collection of weapons though. They have 4 distint types of grenades. I wish they had more distint firearms. The most frustating part of the game is your freeze meter. If your body tempture gets too low you die.. You must constanty go back & forth into building to rejuvinate yourself.. This gets repetitive fast & is very tedious & boring. I found this game to be unsuspenseful in most accounts. The game does a good job of picking up the pace the middle parts & will keep your interest during the more tame beginning of the game. Not knowing who is infected is pretty cool, but lacks in suspense too, cause you know your NPC teammates are going to be infected. Thats a no brainer. There really aren't any suprises. Only a few minor ohh's & Ahh's.. If you have a weekend to kick back & relax, rent it.. Just don't expect it to be a great horror survival experience..	-1
But this game is terrible.  The story line is good, but the controls for this game are unbelievably bad.  Perhaps the most frustrating are the camera angles throughout this game!  I've never dealt with such terrible vantage points and adds to the frustration of the graphics.  The puzzles are difficult and tedious and nothing really good comes out of them.  I might just get rid of this one and try for KH 2.  I heard they improved the gameplay because this game is just terrible.  Overall if you like tedious challenges with little reward then you will enjoy this game.  It was a waste of my time!	-1
I'm gonna get right to the point with this one.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK!  The plot is horrible, the gameplay is immensely dull and the graphics are 2nd rate at best.  This game makes a mockery of th John Carpenter classic.  You will be ready to hurl your controller through the TV after you try to kill a larger alien with fire (which is the ONLY way to kill them) and run out of fuel and die a horrible grisly demise or light a fuel barrl on fire and die a horrible grisly demise 100... times in a row.  Just don't even bother with this pathetic excuse for a game.	-1
i don't have a lot to say except that the game is frustrating and dark. i know this is not helpful but i just wanted to express myself.	-1
People say this is one of the best games on the PS2, and an instant classic. I decided to give it a shot, and I am honestly disappointed in this game. I do not enjoy the characters, especially the protagonist Sora, and the cameos of all the disney characters is very out of place to me. The story is just uninteresting to me as well, and I simply find myself not caring about the story at all, though that might just be me. I got bored quick and it became a chore to finish this game, which for an RPG-like game is very strange for me.	-1
I guess the game is not bad but our daughter got so caught up in it we had to hide it and only allow her to play it for an hour. She got too caught up in the game and would get angry.	-1
At first I didn't want to get it cuz I figured it would be dumb with all the Disney characters in a Squaresoft (Final Fantasy) type game.  I was right!  Not only that, but the game is too hard to figure out.  I'm stuck somewhere I can't get out of... some kind of jungle.  I've gone everywhere I can think of.  The game isn't that fun to play anyway, and the graphics aren't that great for a PS2 game.  The only thing I liked is you get to meet all the characters from the Final Fantasies up to that point, though some looked pretty bad.  They also seemed to transfer the bright blue eyes of the main character to Final Fantasy: Crisis Core for the PSP.  Now that game is at least entertaining.	-1
I love the Terminator movies, but I gotta be honest with you,not this game .... Here's why:  1)Obnoxious camera, in conjunction with the terrible movement controls. I OFTEN found myself getting lost/disorientated/stuck.  2)Not enough outdoor levels. Instead, you run around bases, hotels, parking lots, asylums, etc. You end up feeling very claustrophobic by the 3rd level or so.  3)Speaking of which, there are only 10 levels.  4)There are three characters to play as, but it's not like you get to pick one of the three characters before entering the next level. One mission you may be Kyle Reese, the next you might be some gun-toting female.  (5) If there is one enemy that you will learn to hate REAL fast, it's those annoying flying saucers that knock you on your back when they attack. And then you get up, and unless you destroy it "muy pronto" you're going to get knocked down AGAIN.  (6)I've only seen/fought one T-800 in the game. But you have your Pulsed Plasma Rifle in the 40 Watt range, right? Remember how easily the Resistance killed T-800's in the future scene in Terminator 2? No such thing here. You pump umpteen thousand rounds into this T-800 and he finally softens up. Then you pump another umpteen thousand rounds into him only to saw him in half. But that upper half is still alive, so, Plasma Rifle in hand, you pump another umpteen thousand rounds into him. Goodness, you'd think you were shooting a wimpy .22 or something. It was after that battle that I said, "Forget it, this game isn't worth my time."  (7) You don't get to ride around in vehicles. (But Keep in mind that I stopped at level 7 of 10, so I'm not sure about 8,9, or 10, but I doubt it.)  (8) Easy mode is too hard.  (9) No BIG battles, like the one at the start of T2. Instead, you're reduced to "going-it-alone" missions with occasional run-ins with stupid allies.  (10) And worst of all, this game just simply isn't fun. It's frustrating. Believe me, I tried to like it, but it never happened. You can spend your money on something better than this (like the Terminator films on DVD special editions if you don't have them already).  Here are a couple Terminator game alternatives you might want to consider: Skynet, Terminator 2029,(these latter two were made by Bethesda for the PC, if I remember correctly),various Terminator games for the Gameboy, NES, SNES, and Arcade.  The only good parts about this game are the FMV's, but I'd rather watch the movies than this piece of garbage any day.	-1
Okay, I'm a minority in this, but I hated this game.  But before I rant and rave, the good parts. The controls were good, the graphics were nice and tidy, and the music was SO good.  But the bad... Oh the bad. Quickly I found myself confused as to where to go. I could not work the "Gummy Ship" or travel to other levels easily. I was so confused... And the story itself is not appealing to me. I like Disney Films, or some of them anyway, but mixing Disney and Final Fantasy was DUMb-UH. It was like shoving two puzzle sets together and trying to make a picture with the mess... and you can't do that. Square peg doesn't go into triangle hole! And I hear that the sequels are doubly confusing!  It was unpleasant for me. For others it may be a nostalgic joy ride with two great casts, Final Fantasy and Disney characters going side-by-side. I wanted to see the Winnie the Poo level and the Nightmare Before Christmas level, bud saddly I could not get it to work right, no matter who I talked to, what I did, how far I leveled up, or anything.	-1
Terminator: Dawn of Fate is a pretty fair game- but it tries so hard to be a good game, but hardware and perhaps even legal considerations just kept getting in the way. Dawn of Fate tells the story of the events leading up to Kyle Resse's eventful trip back to the past to save Sarah Connor and destroy the CSM-101 Terminator sent to kill her and prevent John Connor from being born. The game is built around the standard premise of killing terminators, collecting technology for upgrades and of course, the survival of all mankind against the evil and monolithic, Skynet. You get to meet General Connor, Justin Perry and Catherine Luna- friends and comrades of Kyle's and you switch characters between missions. It's odd that they managed to capture the look of post Judgment Day Earth, the battlefields and ruined cities perfectly. Everything Skynet had- all the vehicles- the H/K tanks and aerial units are all there in gleaming chrome, but that's all they captured. The sounds are all wrong. The brilliant purple plasma guns sound like typical game fair and don't have their deep, resonant stutter from the movies. Even the H/Ks don't sound quite right. It's like whichever studio owns the copyright approved using the appearance of everything, but said they couldn't use the sound effects. Either than or the developers decided to do their own. Bad mistake. Another flaw is that the Tech/Com soldiers and their weapons aren't really representative of the movies, either. All I can say about the character models is BAD. Kyle Reese looks like Christopher Walken did as the Hessian in Sleepy Hollow, stupid hair and all. Justin Perry looks like he was carved out of stone and I won't go into how unfeminine Luna looks. Connor is probably the best rendered of the lot. Mission play is broken up into 3rd person play, starting with protecting Connor from an terminator infiltration attack, destroying Tech/Com's computers and blowing up an H/K tank that has rolled into the top floor of the resistance's hideout. In that mission you have to protect a demolitions expert as he plants explosive charges in the massive hotel base, is a royal pain, because he does nothing to defend himself. Instead, he stands there passively getting blasted by terminators while you rush around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to kill them before they grease him. Later missions involve a secondary story that the programmers must have felt was pretty clever. They're wrong. As well you must prevent Skynet from steeling all the platinum from a Federal Reserve bank. Apparently Skynet has just perfected the CSM-101 series infiltrators, but they have also been capturing normal humans and modifying them cybernetic mind control devices. One of these, Alexander Stone, blames Kyle for the death of his brother Gabriel and so has turned traitor, joining forces with Skynet in order to seek revenge. It is he the player must track down because he has stolen Connor's battle plans for an assault against Skynet's main base at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. But while you get the plans back, you can never actually kill Stone. I'm not entirely sure why Skynet would create these hybrids- dressed as they are in black and red leather with cybernetic implants visible on them, it's not like they can blend in like the infiltrator terminators do. Finally it's the main assault on Cheyenne Mountain and you fight your way into the very core of the enemy's main base- blowing up everything in site. The hardest part being the attack on the central computer AI- the heart of Skynet which is apparently SO powerful that it is capable of mind control, a process that takes a few minutes while you work feverishly to cut off the computer's power source before it melts your guy's brain, thus ending the game. So it's a pretty standard story line, except for the silliness of the hybrid part. There are plenty of weapons- grenades, rockets, plasma guns, machine guns, EMP weapons that stun robots for a few seconds- pretty basic stuff. The game offers a first person view, but as with any first-person console game, control is terrible and you're better off not using it except to look around at the scenery. One interesting function is Adrenaline- a function that makes you shoot faster and more accurately which enables you to take down baddies quicker than usual. It doesn't last long so it's best used wisely. Another problem is the Dino Crisis effect- opening doors just to get to another small area to open another door in order to get to another small area and, you guessed it, open another door. It gets old very fast. While there are good concepts here, some nice graphics, the game almost seems crippled in places. Heck, you can't even walk off a ledge and kill yourself because the game won't allow it. But for the most part it seems to be a half-baked attempt to tell the same story that Bethesda Software did a decade ago with `Terminator: 2029', a somewhat more entertaining game, if graphically inferior. Dawn of Fate manages to tell a fair story with repetitive game play- go there, do that, kill this- if you've played Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you'll know what to expect. I'd be interested to see the Xbox version just to check if it at least has better graphics.	-1
This is rediculessy hard. I can only see a video wisard beating this game. I bought it for 20 dollars at gamestop what a rip off	-1
This game was really not that great,I played it thinking that I would love it,but whenever I started playing it,I didn't like it,you can't move you screen which is a HUGE handicap,the gummi ships are bad because you have to put them together piece by piece which takes time and sometimes it won't let you do it. The game is also very hard,I love anything that has to do with Kingdom Hearts but this was a letdown.	-1
My 14-year-old daughter played this game for two hours, shuddered, groaned, erased the file from her memory card, put the disk away in its box with the air of a night nurse cleaning up after an unfortunate accident, and washed her hands up to the elbow.  It's sad to see Disney trying to inculcate good buying habits (buys Disney, get it?) in the very young, and comical to see a kid raise her eyebrow, frown, and grok the entire situation in a sudden furious flash.  Sorry, but Disney's "crown jewels" can't compete with Final Fantasy XII (or even X).  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Valley of the Winds?  And Square Enix should be ashamed of themselves for soiling their own brand.	-1
This game has a lot of potential, but very little skill is required for the majority. The activities necessary to get from point to point aren't so much challenging as they are tedious. For instance, during the vine swinging area you may get right to the end, swing to the next vine, hit it directly, but you will fall and have to start all over again. There are numerous parts of the game where the main objective is getting from point A to point B by jumping from tree tops or vines or pillars, but a few jumps will always be irritatingly right out of your reach, causing you to start from the very beginning every single time. It's not as much fun as it is time consuming as this jumping areas of the game are frequent. I purchased this game believing it was going to be like a fun form of Final Fantasy. It's not. This game isn't childish because it has Disney characters in it; it's childish because the tasks are boring and repetitive.	-1
I really wanted to like this game. And after reading most of the favorable reviews here, I thought why not? I like Disney... I like RPG's (Role Playing Games)...so I'll give it a try.  The graphics are nice with little difference between game play and cut scenes and the storyline seems really involved. However, the problem I had was with the game's camera.  I know this is a problem with most 3-D/free roaming games and it's no exception here. The camera wants to constantly shift to give you a better view of the character you're playing, which is great if you're watching a movie, but not so good if you're playing a game. And yes, you can control the camera by pressing the R2 and L2 buttons at the same time, which repositions the camera behind the character, but as soon as you move, the camera swings again, giving you a different perspective.  With all the swinging involved, I got motion sickness after about an hour of game play. I know that game designers want to wow us with all of the camera angles etc., and how they can blur the lines between watching a movie and playing a game, but watching the character you're controlling run towards the camera, when you really need to see where you're going, is not helpful.  Another thing I don't like is that the camera is really closeup and you can't really see the environment clearly unless you switch to the first person/character view, which allows you to see through the character's eyes, but that slows down game play.  If I had known about the camera problems I would have passed on this game. I know that most people aren't bothered by this, but for me, I can't get into the game with the camera going to and fro all the time, making me nauseous.	-1
Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion.	-1
I tried so hard to get into this game.  I love RPGs and especially the Final Fantasy series, along with dungeon crawlers (such as Dark Cloud and Zelda).  This game bored me so incredibly with its easy button pressing and redundant music whenever I was walking or fighting (the cutscene music is excellent).  The gameplay is seriously lacking in the FF strategy and Zelda variety, being a simplified version of a dungeon crawler.  This is not for RPG veterans.  It will offer them no challenge and just put them to sleep.  I recommend this to the younger gamers who have not played any (or many) RPGs.  If you are not a part of this crowd, steer clear.	-1
This game has a great idea behind it. Putting characters from two beloved franchises (Final Fantasy and Disney) into a brand-new storyline with a few new, original characters is a stroke of genius, and it works well. The environments are colorful and perfectly capture the fantasy vibe; the original PSone models of old FF characters are brought to the next-gen world with great graphics and superb voice-acting. The story itself is also interesting. So I happily leapt into this game, really excited about the whole thing.  Then, something terrible happened: gameplay. Sora (the main character) moves so clunkily and imprecisely that both combat and exploration are a chore. If battles were turn-based in classic Square fashion, this would be easier to deal with, but they're not. They're done in real-time, meaning that you are never given a rest from the painful controls. No matter how fast I tapped the buttons or moved the control stick, Sora's attacks were always several steps behind my commands. And when I was platforming in the "exploration" segments, his pitiful jumps and tendency to keep moving once I released the analog stick was continually frustrating.  All this wouldn't be so bad if the game was forgiving enough to accomodate the interface, but that isn't the case. Indeed, the difficulty is actually harder than many games I've played with better control schemes. Enemies are whip-quick and surround you in a flash; platforms are tiny and widely spaced; and replenishing items are always in short supply.  Another complaint I have is that the puzzles don't make sense. Unlike better RPGs (Paper Mario 2, for example), where you can analyze the area and figure out what you're supposed to do, Kingdom Hearts gives you no clues. I would have been stumped within minutes if I didn't have the strategy guide to back me up. Like everything else in the game, the puzzles must be done perfectly, with no mistakes, or you have to start over. Seeing as you don't know if something is a mistake or not until you do it, this gets very tedious and frustrating.  Overall, playing this game felt like trying to dismantle a ticking time bomb with no tools, where touching one wire could mean death: stressful, confusing, and definitely not fun. And after a while, it doesn't even matter that the bomb is decorated with beloved characters and bright colors.	-1
it's not really action rpg...this is more of a platform game which is why i hate it! you have to do alot of stupid jumps that are not easy to do because the platforms are ridiculously far apart. don't buy this game! frustrating, not fun at all! worst game ever!	-1
Oh boy squaresoft is on a role. They have been dishin out some sh*tty a*s games lately but this has to be the biggest piece of sh*t squaresoft has dispensed out of their behind. So lets take a look at the title first...A little fruity I know. Ok ok lets take it from the basics. I bought the game a year after it came out....Due to the huge hype about. You know all these little nerds sayin "Man Kingdom Hearts is awesome!!" or "Man I couldn't take a crap without Kingdom Hearts". Personally I dispiesed the game but you know what peer pressure does to you. Living here in Japan squaresoft was hailed as the greatest RPG maker ever which I can understand i.e. Mystic Quest (Personal Fav) Nevertheless with a name like Kingdom Hearts...Makes you question the game. Know in this day in age when to people use the word kingdom? I've never even heard the word empire used unless people were punning at the united states government. Anyways Kingdom makes you think of faries and nonsense...hence disney and their perverted godness. Hearts makes you think of a smelly old love story..Or a great classic card game!! So if the name doesnt drive you away lets see what does.  Upon further dissection the game is simply compiled of a gay character who looks like a cheaply made version of all the Final Fantasy characters. Now for a lot of you readers maybe I should have told you this before but if you don't like Final Fantasy you might...I mean you won't like this game at all. The truth of the matter is, that this game is a fantasy of its own. A bunch of fantasy looking characters hanging out with the queers of Disney. How fun!! So the theme of the game is to search for your gay lover....Actually I never took the time to understand the point of the game though I believe it had to do with searching. Nevertheless the gay characters will pretty much make you want to go and buy Soul Reaver its that bad!! Squaresoft has outdone itself this time. Teaming up with disney must have been a sign of Squaresoft reaching rock bottom. Their time on deathrow was almost up but with Disney on their back nothing is to fear. So they made up some lame queerish characters and made a bad story and whipped it all together...hence "Kindom Hearts" How sad. When I remembered great classical games they took time and dedication...This game took a whole bunch of as*holes and just glued them together. The game is retarded as hell and I know for a fact that a 5 year old could throw up a better game then this.  For your own saftey I would stay away from this game. Its cheap graphics, gameplay, music, characters....there are just so many aspects of this game that suck its so hard for me to tell you. But seriously if your that bored to buy this game sure do it. But you'll have 50X more fun buy breaking it with a hammer:)	-1
After having experienced some nasty behavior from UBI before, I decided to download the free trial from their website before actually purchasing the full version of this game. I'm glad I did. The graphics are old, my computer and drivers are not, and even as a trial this game was a disapointment.  Once the avatar was created, the progression was boring.  I felt like I was playing the original PS version of Diablo all over again. No thanks - I've moved beyond that stage. The premise - the political manouvers that are possible with on-line play, and the interaction of the characters, is fantastic.  The reality just isn't.	-1
As a fan of Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) I have seen and played countless incarnations of the same basic premise.  They all share a lack of story, and boil down to mindless monster bashing for levels and loot. However, Shadowbane was different, at least in the beginning.  At first glance, Shadowbane offers players a wealth of opportunities.  Join or create a guild, and then build a city of your own.  No longer are players forced to use computer controlled cities as rallying points.  Shadowbane allows anyone and everyone to easily create their own city.  However, this great feature is also its curse. Shadowbane is at heart a Player Killers dream.  For those who don't know, a Player Killer(PKer) is someone who spends their time searching out and killing other players, instead of monsters and NPCs.  Those grand cities that you can create, can also be destroyed by other cities and guilds.  PKers tend to group together for protection, and spend time hunting down unsuspecting individuals who only wish to be left alone to build their characters and cities in peace. Shadowbane not only allows such activity, it promotes it.  It does this by unceremoniously dumping low level characters onto the mainland(populated by the afore mentioned PKers) as soon as they reach a certain level.  New players can band together, but will still easily be crushed by one or two higher levels ones that wait outside the 3 safe cities. Having played through the beta, and a couple months worth of the release, I have seen very little of this change.  Shadowbane's concept begins as great, but ends up failing in the end as everyone resorts to mindless leveling for loot and experience.  Its purpose is slightly different from all the others though.  Instead of leveling just to be able to take on bigger and better monsters, you are leveling to take on bigger and better players. In the end, Shadowbane falls short of its goal of revolutionizing MMORPGs, and ends up where they all do after a month or two.  It sits on a shelf collecting dust, and is quickly replaced by newer versions of the same premise.  Hindsight being 20/20, I would have not wasted my time with Shadowbane, and I highly suggest you don't either.	-1
Now I do enjoy the gameplay and such of this game, but I do not like the fact that the makers of this game, UBI Soft, just want money. They give extra content to players that pay (and play) more. There are three special races restricted only to players that pay a years worth of monthly subscriptions for this game. Not only that but those 3 races are some of the coolest races in the game and players that aren't sure if they want to play for an entire year and order only a one month subscription CAN'T PLAY THESE RACES which makes me furious. The three races are the Minotaur, Aracoix, and the Centaur. Now the Minotaur is right on the box so it's a shame that players who actually want to just try out the game won't get to play them. Centaurs are half man half horse which is awesome. Aracoix is the most amazing thing ever, they are bird-like creatures that can actually fly! And UBI Soft is only letting the players that order a one year subscription for this game play these races. So if you are positive that you are going to play (and pay) for an entire year and don't mind if UBI Soft spoils the players that pay more and give them free stuff. I am totally 100% against this and if you, like me and many other players, don't feel that it's fair to give the players extra content which leads to more fun because they pay you more than the average player, THEN STAY AWAY!	-1
When I first reviewed this game, I had only put in about 12 hours into the game, and felt that, even though it had some problems, it wasn't an awful game.  After beating it, I now realize it's quite possibly the worst Squaresoft game ever made.  I realize the company I'm putting it in (Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?)  Here why: Upon further game play I came to realize that: 1. This game took itself WAY WAY WAY too seriously.  It's Squaresoft and Disney.  Pick your poison, but don't chose both.  Disney is about morality and making the right choice, Square usually philosophizes about some greater meaning to life.  Put the two together and you see my point.  You start preaching religiosoty, or so it seemed.  For a game that was about 75% Disney, this game should have been on the lighter side, more so for Square to show off its sense of humor, which I've yet to see.  Sadly, it's REALLY hard to take Donald and Goofy seriously as people fighting to save the universe.  I'd have had more fun laughing through the game than being iritated at the pathetic attempts at comic relief for what was really a darn good story. 2.  It was Maddeningly Reptitive: This game was a hack and smash game the whole way.  Truly sad showing of gameplay from Square.  Despite the obvious camera problems, this game offered no true strategy, except start hitting X and heal yourself.  All the bonus attacks are nice, but it's essentially the same food, different wrapper.  Magic?  Magic is so unbelieveably worthless it's amazing why they even put it in the game.  Regualar cast spells are useless, save for Aero and Cure.  Call spells, which initially look nice with Simba, go for silly when we see Bambi prancing around.  Even to satisfy Disney fans with the token appearances of Dumbo and Mushu from Mulan (what, Quasimodo from Hunchback was unavailable???), they could have done it better.  As such, using the call spells, while looking pretty, are essentially useless as well. Abysmal Difficulty setting: I played my first time through on Normal (instead of expert), and was not surprised to see my first few foes fall like dominoes.  When I lost about 6 straight times to Cerberus (the 2nd boss), I wondered if this game knew what it was doing.  Sadly, it never learned.  The boss battles varied greatly from insanly easy, to insanly hard, though none of those hard fights came when they should have.  The optional bosses, and the coliseum bosses (Sephiroth especially), were amazingly hard, yet the end boss and the 7 or so previous fights to get to him are so worthless, you almost never have to heal.  Ursula, a mandatory boss, was by far and away the hardest (mandatory boss, Sephiroth is the toughest in the game), and she's only the 6th boss!  Games are supposed to get harder, not easier.  It makes for a very unsatisfying climax. KH had Massive Plot Holes: This game is as confusing as they come, which is pretty hard considering the story is so rudimentary that a 5 year old should be able to understand.  However; aside from an ending which makes NO sense at ALL, the final boss is never explained.  He just shows up, says, "I'm the bad dude, come fight me" and off you go.  I had no real desire to beat him, other than to just see how it ended, which as I said, was poorly.  Also, there seems to be a council of bad guys in the beginning, plotting to destroy our adventurers.  Sadly though, they conspire for a grand total of one level!  You never see them together again!  Jafar runs off, Hades runs off, Captain Hook, Oogie boogie, the whole lot.  Opec has better organizational skills.  Why come together at all? Lastly, It suffered from sidequest"itis": As with many games now, people apparently have too short attention spans to finish a game clear through without some sort of side quest to help us keep our minds fresh.  I can deal with one or two, even a few tied into the plot if they make sense, but KH went overboard.  I'll ignore the Gummi ship for now, because it was less of a quest and more of a "worst idea for an in-game "game" ever"  No, amazingly, these other quests were actually more compelling than the game itself, which isn't good.  I was more concerned with beating sephiroth after I realized how easy the final boss was, and the rest of the coliseum games and synthesizer items, than I was with really finishing the game.  I could have finished in 25 hours, but I spent an extra 10 trying to beat those extras.  When I did beat the game, it was more out of "well, it's due back tomorrow, so I guess I need to beat it," than a "OMG, I HAVE to see what's next!!" I can't really say much more.  This is everything a Squaresoft game should NOT be.  I don't know if one can blame the Disney colaboration, though they can be blamed for a ton.  No, truly, this is just a bad game.  It looks good, and sounds good, but anyone who knows square that after about 5 hours you know something isn't right, and about 5 more later, you'll realize just how bad Kingdom Hearts is.	-1
My neghibor is in 6th grade and he beat it in one night.  Does this tell you anything?	-1
I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and I pretty much have ever game with Star Wars in the title.  After Rouge Squadron II on the GameCube, I couldn't wait for The Clone Wars, which can roughly be described as Rougue Squadron on the ground.  While the graphics are amazing, the game play that has made so many Star Wars games fun to play was lacking in this game in my opinion.  The single player missions are fun, and the difficulty on Jedi Knight is extremely tough.  I just didn't get into the game.  I did not like the ground based fighting game and only found fun flying.  The times when you are a Jedi are laughable.  If one has played Jedi Knight II, on PC, they will understand what I mean.  The multiplayer is absolutely horrible.  I played it with 3 of my friends and after 10 minutes, we played something else, due to the lack of entertainment and fun.  If you are a hardcore Star Wars fan, you'll probably like it, if you are a gamer looking for a challenge with great multiplayer capabilties, get Time Splitters 2, and pass on this game.	-1
If you're by any means a seroius gamer, this is definitely a big waste of your time. I'm not quite sure whether it's rated "M" or "T", but it's a silly game, based on characters from other games and the whole thing doesn't make much sense.	-1
First of all,I didn't even want to rent this game cause I thought it looked stupid and insulted everything that was great about final fantasy. I SHOULD have listened to my first instincts,but instead I gave into to so many whining squaresoft "fans" who said that this really is a great game,you just have to get past the fact that there's disney. HA! I'd like to know how that is possible when everywhere you turn,disney is screamed in your face;the shield has a mickey mouse emblem on it,the sword has a mickey mouse emblem on it,everything has a mickey mouse emblem on it! What really bothered me the most about this game was all the subliminal messages in it. For example one of the final fantasy characters in the final fantasy world says"Our world is just one tiny peice that is part of something much greater!"OH!I see,so final fantasy is just something insignificant and what's sooo much greater is disney! This also leads me to ask that if each individual disney story/movie had it's own world,then why couldn't they have done the same for each individual installment of final fantasy?Every final fantasy fan knows that the diffrent stories in the series where always on an epic level,so why does disney treat the final fantasy anthology so unimportantly?By just mixing all the final fantasy characters from diffrent games into one world to call it's own was a slap in squaresoft's face. And just look how they depicted poor cid from ff7!They gave him blonde hair(he's older and has grey hair)plus they got rid of his cigarette and put a twig in his mouth....grrrr! Of course I suppose disney was the right partner to choose for this project since squaresoft seems only to want to make interactive movies instead of games. By this,I mean the same problem with kingdom hearts was what I saw in final fantasy X; play a little bit then watch a cinema(which you can't skip over either),play a little bit more then watch another cinema! This replays itself over and over and gets extremely annoying. Graphics seem to be more important than gameplay. Lastly kingdom hearts is not a true rpg to which it passes itself over as on the box. It isn't a true rpg in the sense that there is no turn based battle system;it's an action rpg with free moving enemies and heroes. This tied in with the locking system makes it much more like zelda:ocarina of time than any of the final fantasy series. Why squaresoft chose to do this is a mystery to me since the game is supposed to tie in with final fantasy. My only guess is that it was probabaly disney's idea,since they see fit to march right in and change every aspect about anything with THIS world! The saying for kingdom hearts is "You'll never know who you'll run into next."I think the saying for disney should be "You never know what we'll take over next!" I'd rather eat a bucket full of broken glass than play this disney comercial!!	-1
The truth is plane and simple, it's not the best game but it is an addictive game. I was desappointed to see no real battle animation, but it does have a feel to the original trading card game. It does get boring, doing the samethings over and over again, but for a kid i guess it's an ok game. There are better games out there such as Metroid Fusion and Megaman Zero, but eternal soul is not half bad give it a try.	-1
This expansion mostly adds features that should have been included in the first release. Every decent strategy game out there ships with multiplayer...you shouldn't charge more later for what should be included. A scenario editor also comes standard in many games these days. It can't be difficult to ship a scenario editor with the game. A few more civilizations? Wow. Great. Woohoo. Not worth the price. If this had the kind of innovative content that Fantastic Worlds had when it was released as an expansion to Civ2, I'd look foreward to it. Unfortunately, it looks to be simply what's required to finish an incomplete game.	-1
I felt ripped-off. I love Civ III, but this add-on is total trash. Nothing to it. It is only good for their pocket books, I was very let down that this trash was put on the market. It is not worth even a dime!!! Wyatt Kaldenberg	-1
Well I must say I was expecting much more. I was never a very hard core civ fan, but do enjoy playing from time to time, so I decided I might as well check out the expansion pack. But after reading the manual and playing for a few hours I began to think, "I just wasted 30 bucks". Generally the problem was, it just didn't add enough, sure it has plenty of new civilizations, but what I really wanted was lots of new wonders and units. Instead it only had the new special civ units, one normal new unit, and one new wonder, with a few extra small gameplay features thrown in such as the ability to move units in a stack. However I still was not satisfied with judging my buy as a failure so I decide to try out the main focus of the expansion pack, online play. I entered to find only about 10 games, all of which were in progress except for one. I joined and it turned out to be one of those game types were everyone finishes turns at different times. I was quite unhappy with the way it turned out, everyone just rushing to finish their turns. After words I tried a normal turn based game, which took about 8 hours until I decided to quit. Overall, the problem was, I just don't think civ 3 was meant to be online, and they just didn't add enough other features to make it interesting enough.	-1
Am I the only one that thought that Civ3 outright sucked?  Civilization and Civ2 were Earth-shattering for me.  Then "Call to Power1 & 2" became favorites.  Civ3 just seemed like a huge step backwards.  Anyway, along comes Medievil: Total War.  MTW is actually two games in one.  It is a military/dictatorship strategy game on the one hand.  Expect intuitive city management and troop creation menus.  However, it is also an awesome combat engine.  You can lead your troops DURING a battle.  You can decide if it makes more since to have your longbowman fight melee style or leave that to your spearmen (which I strongly suggest).  Everything about MTW is polished and intuitive.  Comparing MTW to Civ3 would be like comparing Halo (the coolest game ever for those of you that haven't played Halo - drop what you are doing and get it) to Quake1 - they are both "first person shooters" but Halo has taken it to a whole new galaxy.  Do not waste your hard earned money on Civ3.  MTW is an intuitive addictive strategy game that won't let you go.	-1
Civilization was one of the computer games which gave me my enthusiasm for gaming way back in computer gaming's Bronze Age. Civilization 2 was unquestionably an enormous leap forward with the core design of the original game. I also very much loved Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri: in some ways, it is my favorite of the three games, and I still play it quite often. So of course I bought Civilization 3 the moment it was available. Oddly, I stopped playing it after two months. I told myself that it was because I was busy, or distracted by other games, or by events in my life. In preparation for the release of Play the World, I decided to start playing Civ 3 again. The first problem with Play the World, unfortunately, is Civilization 3 itself. It's just not a very good game. It has some good ideas--the effect of culture, for example--which are mostly badly implemented and lead to extremely frustrating or annoying gameplay. Does anyone enjoy conquering an enemy city, moving troops back out of the city, having it revert to its original holder no matter what you do, reconquering it, and so on until the city is reduced to size 1? The paradoxical effect of culture, designed to allow for peaceful absorption of other civilizations, is that it often leads to a much more genocidal approach to military conquest. There's a lot like that in Civ3: design elements that may be interesting ideas (or not) but that don't work well at all as implemented. Now I foolishly ventured into getting Play the World just to see whether that made a difference. I'm not sure whether multiplayer would make the game better because multiplayer in Play the World doesn't work unless you're on a LAN. Thank God I bought it from a store where I could return it. I'm disappointed because the one thing I have looked for from Firaxis is a certain degree of professional reliability. Play the World is in terms of basic bugginess and functionality one of the worst major releases in the past year.	-1
this game is horrrrrrrrrrrrrrible. I have tried the demo and it is way to slow, basically just a complete copy of mech warrior. They shouldn't bother with this game, they should just stick to mech warrior. Trust me	-1
Wasn't as good graphics as I thought.	-1
My 10 year old must have thought this was something different.  He has not played with it much and said he does not like it. He has several other star wars games, not sure why, but this does not interest him.	-1
I really wanted to like this game, as this franchise is one that talks me back to my PC gaming roots. But I just cant get into the overall animation style for this game and how kiddy orientated the game is, I like more maturity from my MMOs and this one was way too childish for me and the raiding is just plane lame in this game	-1
It seems to me, with very rare exception, that for the last ten years, 80% of the Star Wars games that are released are all (basically) clones of the old 'Rebel Assault' PC title.  Dress them all up anyway you want, but when all's said and done, you're really playing the same game. You will have several different vehicles to pilot as well as being on foot, but the whole game's plot is essentially the same: finish the level as fast as you can without getting killed ... that's it.  There's not a lot of strategy involved past that, that's about it.  Frustrating part is, they could have stuck to the mold and still added a little variety.  For example, how about letting us pilot one of those AT-ATs for a little while? The one thing that I had hoped may be a saving grace would be the animated cut-scenes between levels, but even they were a little sub-par.  Aside from the animation being (at best) average, there were too few of them.  Even the ending animation scene was only about a minute or two!  I finished the game and that's all I'm rewarded with? I'll also answer the question that I know at least a few of you have.  No ... this game will not lend any hints to what may be ahead in the new Episode III and does nothing to advance the plot of the prequel trilogy.  They may have been able to sell a few more titles if this game was a little more tied to the plot of the movies.  The recently released 'Enter the Matrix' game as a terrific example to what I'm talking about.  On a side note, it was nice though to see an old character from the comic books named Ulric Qel-Droma make an appearance. So, as been stated before, if you liked Rebel Assault (I or II), Starfighter, Bounty Hunter, and Jedi Starfighter ... etc etc ... then this is probably going to be right up your alley.  One the other hand, if (like me) you're getting a little burned-out on this style of play, this isn't going to do ANYTHING for you.	-1
I give this one star simply not because the game isn't good but the DVD is outdated you would be better off just buying it from Blizzards site online and downloading it as the DVD itself here will be worthless considering that pretty much all the content of World of Warcraft has been upgraded since Cataclysm.  Why they have not pulled these disks and come out with a new boxed product say called World of Warcraft: The Shattering which contains most of the data needed for patch 4.03a so that it would actually be useful for those who either have slow downloads or like me have now have to deal with the stupid download cap that many ISPs are now putting on subscribers.  The game itself is great and the CD key that comes with it will give you the full game (and burning crusade too!) but this product as a boxed product is out of date.  also if you are not sure about getting the game you can go on world of war-crafts website and play the game AS LONG AS YOU WANT FREE up until level 20 now!  which is pretty sweet.  Its a great game but just keep in mind this disk is out of date and aside for the key itself is pretty much useless.	-1
There is a monthly charge to play online and game does not play offline was disappointed with the game not what I wanted at all.	-1
World of WarCraft, should have been named world of WarCrap. This game is nothing but a rip off on every level. It's way over priced. It can't handle the population that it gets. It want let you play without going on line. That is the major problem right there. Any game that want let you play without joining and paying 280 a year is nothing but a rip off. I'm also told that there is a suprise in this world. Well they mentioned it on BB theory the other night. OMG. Get a life folks. NOTHING BUT A RIP OFF. STAY AWAY.	-1
But, this game is an absolute waste of time, in all senses of the word.  It is not fun, it is not addictive, the only thing it manages to do is simulate work while you're supposed to be enjoying your leisure time.  I completely regret making this purchase, and have canceled my account a LONG.. LONG.. LONG time ago.  Countless players tried to dissuade me from doing so while I was still playing - just wait until 60, just wait until 70, just wait until 80.. That's all that this game seems to be - a waiting game. Watching a bar roll across the screen as you dispatch a monster arbitrarily over and over again, then finish the quest that asked you to kill ten of that monster, only to get a tiny bit of vendor trash from it, sell it, buy better gear, get a skill, move onto the next area.  From Level One, the amount of time it takes to kill a single monster, stays consistent throughout the entire game. You basically just use more skills and smash more buttons while doing so - some players in the game equated this to 'skill', rather then sitting there and watching the equivalent of an interactive 'press the button now!' TV programme.  Playstyles between classes seem to be a 'color filter' over the same rigorous process. Instead of dispatching the ten Ettins you needed with a sword, you can use daggers, claws, arrows, or magic. The difference is essentially null.  Please, heed the advice of an old gaming enthusiast. Save your life, don't even start playing this game. Find something more valuable to do with your time. Read a book, write some fiction, read some philosophy - go to college, it'll do you some good. Just DON'T PLAY THIS GAME.	-1
Interesting game at certain levels.  At low levels this game can be very fun.  lots of people and easier leveling make it very entertaining.  And then it stops... there is a pretty large gap in people and grouping from the low levels about 30ish until your level 70.  The game has become a solo grind until you get 70 because a majority of the game content is written for level 70 or is so outdated that its not useful or even possible to get people to explore the content on most occasions.  Once a character reaches level 70 it is pretty much a requirement for a person to devote themselves to either pvp which then is mostly a solo act again unless you happen to find an active pvp guild which can be very challenging and on a whole is a very limited experience. pvp requires that you grind for the gear that make a character able to compete with other characters.  very little of the pvp system relies on a players skill.  The other major option is to engage in PVE which the player can experiance a wide range of content.  this can be a very interesting way to explore wow though once again very quickly it becomes a limited venue do to the social demands of guilding and gear that are required to continue to explore the content.  Months can be spent to gain a new item that is only marginally better than a previous one and one that could be replaced in days if a player was willing to devote their free time and suffer the whims of a higher ranked guild.  All for all.. if your a new player expect at least a couple of months of solo grinding to get your character to a point that you will be even socially eligible to be able to enjoy the majority of the content of the game.  If your willing to do that the game can be very fun.	-1
Sadly, even though the game itself is great, if you're going into it with an idea that you'll be entering a different fantasy world be warned - it's exactly like real life, only more so in many respects. Both myself and my fiancee experienced almost nonstop incidents of harassment, sexual harassment, foul language, blatant racism, psychotics who've made the game their only interest in life (and believe the game belongs only to them, and you HAVE to play their way or they'll dog your every step and insult you constantly), on and on and on. The Blizzard game managers exercise almost no control over the situation, and do pretty much nothing to help players having these problems. Usually the only solution they offer is to recommend changing realms (for a $25 fee per character, gee thanks), change your character's name to chase the harassers away (for just a $10 fee per character - what a bargain!) or for you to put offending players on 'ignore'. But we found all realms equally bad, and after 'ignoring' up to 100 players per day for almost 6 months we just got fed up and realized there were better and more productive ways to spend our lives. If you're a parent thinking about exposing your children to this world, I strongly urge you to pass it by unless you want your kids to learn how to be abusive and foul mouthed.	-1
I think it's important to be properly acquainted with a game before it is reviewed, but in order to rate it it's necessary to be acquainted with the competition without having been stuck with the product for years developing a bias. Incessantly, World of Warcraft is reviewed, ranked, and revered as having 'charm' and 'fun' that its competitors cannot touch, and that the competitors are only mere clones. But in truth, World of Warcraft is a clone of many MMORPGs that came before it, and other recent games such as Guild Wars and especially Lord of the Rings Online do indeed have charm, beauty, and a level of detail that World of Warcraft cannot even come close to.  There are a few reasons why everyone and his brother, dog, and fish all play World of Warcraft: the game has a name that was already world famous for gameplay (Warcraft, which was a Real-Time Strategy game), the graphics are very, VERY low-end but with enough color and cartoony charm to appeal to an unusually wide range of ages of players, and as such the game targets the broadest common denominator.  That said, World of Warcraft is NOT the game for you if you're looking to push a new 512MB VRAM GeForce 7/8 series video card to its limits. There's nothing graphically spectacular here. Apparently, that's not the point of WoW.  It would seem that WoW is about peer pressure and hanging out with friends and being "cool" and developing biases about a now-archaic game to pre-judge all other viable games, no matter their merit, as "clones". Certainly, WoW has made itself a legend in gaming history. And newer games (such as LOTRO) do indeed reproduce a lot of trivial elements that are seen in WoW. But it's far too easy to forget that WoW itself was a rip-off of 3D MMORPG legends before its own time, including Asheron's Call and EverQuest. In fact, most of the gameplay elements in LOTRO were taken from Turbine's own original legacy Asheron's Call, not WoW. Only a few trivial touches seen in WoW were cloned, all other "cloned" elements derived from other sources.  The gameplay in WoW is decent, but the mechanics can be annoying. WoW has every bit as many grinding as the worst grinding moments of every ther MMORPG out there. The level of sophistication of the initial quests are rediculous: Kill 12 [breed of monster]s. No not those identical twin monsters directly adjacent to them. And wait your turn--everyone else is doing the same thing.  Getting lost in WoW is as boring as in any MMORPG. Given the outdated graphics and obsolete AI, you may find yourself severely uninspired to keep moving. Combat situations in WoW are unoriginal, and actually quite flawed. I don't know about what the other races are like or if you can turn it off, but every time I try to use a skill and don't have enough energy, my character shouts, "I don't have enough energy!" That is extremely annoying to me. I could tolerate a short and simple musical note or something, and would prefer nothing to happen at all. Equally annoying is the fact that visual feedback for this is isolated from the skills toolbar other than the fact that the skills are simply disabled / dimmed; one must monitor the Energy bar at the top of the screen. Most MMORPGs have this wrong; in Guild Wars, I rearranged my user interface so that the "mana" / "magic" (blue bar, whatever it's called) is directly adjacent to the skills bar. If WoW supports UI rearrangements, this would be necessary to me. I haven't checked yet.  I mentioned that the graphics are low-end. This is true; they do push systems of 2004 or so, but this is 2007. To make up for this, theming is very heavy--buildings are lopsided, players are shaped with exaggerated features, and colors are painfully solid (solid green flora, solid blue sky, solid gray brick buildings, etc.) If you dig that or don't care, great. I for one prefer to sink in my chair and inhale the beauty of Lord of the Rings Online, with the incredibly detailed sky, the flock of birds in the sky, the rainbow, the very organic-feeling grass, the beautiful moon, and so on. If I'm going to stare at a character's butt all day, I also prefer to stare at my quaint Hobbit in LOTRO or my beautiful character in Guild Wars over WoW's low-polygon cartoony ogre thug or lopsided human.  I don't doubt that those who have played WoW for a long time are thoroughly enjoying themselves. My frustration is with the fact that most WoW players are first-time players of MMORPGs--a fact proven by numbers alone--and they have no idea of how unfairly prejudiced they are about the game that introduced them to the genre when they judge other very fine games. *Of course* they will look down on them. It doesn't matter that they supercede many or all elements of what makes WoW great (other than sheer quantity of players). People will always be biased for what they have been playing for a long time.  My review of WoW, then, concludes with this: WoW is popular because of viral marketing, not because it's a spectacular game. Is it a good game? Sure. Does it stack up to other MMORPGs? Well, if you forget numbers for a moment, WoW stands on its own but it really does not overcome them all. Do I think it's worthy of 5 stars? Absolutely not, I reserve that for Lord of the Rings Online. 4 stars? No, I was annoyed and frustrated when I tried WoW.  So if your friends or family are playing WoW and they're trying to get you to join them, by all means, sign up and join the party. But if you're on your own and you have a good gaming PC and you just want to enjoy an MMORPG experience, WoW is nothing to be ashamed of, but I would recommend that you consider the alternatives--especially those alternatives that most of the MMORPG newbies (i.e. the bulk of WoW veterans) dismiss as "cheap clones". You might find as I have that the dismissal is with little merit, and that they aren't cheaply implemented at all but very well made iterations of a MMORPG genre that has a decades-old legacy.	-1
I picked this game up a few months back. I got it because I just got through with Mass Effect and loved that game. Well the folks who did Mass Effect for the most part also had a hand in making this Star Wars game, Knights of the Old Republic.  I'll make this short, because I think some people need to know just how flipping boring this game is. The dialogue is okay. You have to read it, and there is no actual speach. I can live with that, especially since this game did come out a few years back.  However, the action sequences are left the game found wanting. You press a button, and watch your characters do all the work. "Wow. That's it?!" Is what I thought to myself. I'm not much of an RPG guy, but when I hear the words "ACTION" and "FUN TO PLAY" associated with it, I tend to think their might be some challenging action scenes to go along with a game with story line. You know, something like Deus Ex, or Mass Effect. Heck, even the Final Fantasy guys get it right year after year. I say all of that, so I don't get people flaming me saying I just don't like RPGs. I do like RPGs, just the good ones.  I felt like I was being spoon fed everything to continue on with the game. It wasn't challenging at all. I had to quit after playing this game for about an hour. I kept telling myself it will get better, and it never did.  Sorry folks, but Star Wars games like the X-Wing/Tie Fighter series, Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, and even the Rebel Assault games were better than this crap.  You want a good RPG from Bioware? Play Mass Effect. You want a good RPG period? Play Lost Odyssey, or Diablo, or Titan's Quest, or the Elder Scrolls series, or the Fallout series, or Final Fantasy. Just not this game.	-1
Freezes constantly!  The cut scenes have not worked yet, and the game will stop in the middle of loading.  It skips during action sequences.  The level maps themselves are the "go here - do this" type with no room for original thought or puzzle solving of any kind.  The characters were interesting at time, but the plot kept jumping in the way.  I'd be in the middle of going somewhere on a level and I'd be prompted to talk to one of the other characters.  I found this game frustrating and monotonous.  Morrowind is far superior in ever respect.  Maybe my expectations are too high.  Maybe I bought a defective copy.  What ever the reason, I'm annoyed that I paid as much for this game as I did.	-1
This game, which I think is much like Diablo 2 (same general shutff), is addicting to no end.  You WILL be playing this game all the time, and you will feel like crap when you are not.  It is the same thing as tobacco withdrawl, expect virtual.  Most of the people who play (yes, most) are jerks who care only about gold and items and raids.  It is like a second life which gains importance over your first.  It also is not cheap to play this game... $15 a month which is $180 a year, which means some people have already payed $375 to play this game for 2 years.  Due credit is given to the developers however, because they created a immersive, enormous world plus a GOLDMINE!  Use your discresion when considering this purchase.	-1
Though I like this game a lot I found that it is much better on the computer. Because of the keyboard the computer version has more freedom and doesn't have to fit all the controls on a xbox controller. So if you have a computer and xbox and want this game go for the pc version.	-1
Please don't discount me as a random detractor or as a noob.  I have plenty of end game experience on my 60 and my friends on theirs, and we share an opinion that this game is, in fact, fairly pointless and poorly done.  Although it is fun for a while, you get dragged in and then when you reach 60 you suddenly have no options for how to advance.  You can either become a mindless part of a guild in which you go on incredibly restrictive several hour raids in boring zones, or whither.  Most experienced mmo players would ask what the alternative is, or disagree because they think there are other options within this game.  The alternative is devising small raiding (20 person max) for the good gear so that players are part of a real group and also to put in more balanced content for crafting and pvp.  Thank heaven for Lord of the Rings Online; wait for that, don't play this trash.	-1
The idea is cool.  The game is well thought-out.  I stopped playing because I was doing the same thing over and over again...just got boring.  The game is addictive...but just wasn't for me.	-1
Hmmm where to start. Well I played for almost a year trying to find that 'interesting or rewarding part', it apparently doesn't exist. After level 5 (of 60, it takes about 4 months of playing daily to reach 60) the game-play becomes mundane, generally you get abilities that are damage or recovery from damage and the attention of the enemy monsters and kill things, thats it... There is no way to lose level or stay dead other than game bugs (there are plenty of those). Essentially if you played up to level 5 you've encountered everything it has to offer, later levels just mean more buttons and slightly different textures. Oh and the characters and geometry appears to be designed by an anti-social teenager, like the ones the draw pictures of distorted muscle men with giant shoulders... Interestingly enough that's the target market and the main player profile. You will encounter quests that tell you to murder people, commit genocide, and of course steal from your victims, with lots of racist and factionalism dialog! Essentially this is a game that can only be described as 'for sociopaths' and the mundane. The actual game mechanics are built to make sure more sophisticated and intelligent gamers have no advantage, and the reward system is based on time spent playing rather than accomplishment or skill. there are hours of filler in order to extend playtime ( in order to extend your subscription ) rather than compelling content. Fillers include time penalties, effects that make you wait until they expire, absurdly long and very slow travel, very low loot drops for items required for quests, extremely long and boring battles, and of course lots of server downtime. In the end I only feel that this game was a complete scam, a waste of my time and money, I feel ripped off and I will under no circumstance buy a game from blizzard or anyone that has worked for them.	-1
As my topic suggests, World of Warcraft does a lot of damage to the Warcraft Universe. Fans of the RTS games, who have followed the arcing storyline will be disappointed with this mess of a game.  In an attempt to "dumb" this MMO enough for the masses to understand it, they pretty much destroyed the Warcraft Universe with some of the most mundane storylines I've seen in a game. I sometimes shudder to think this might be the end all of the Warcraft series, and can't for the life of me, picture what Warcraft 4 (the RTS) will have as it's story, since WoW has pretty much destroyed the foundation previously laid by the other games.  The game mechanics are simple, at best. A new player gets to "create" their avatar (I use the word create loosely, as the customization provided by this game is laughable at best). After that, you start in the "newbie" area, where you will have to complete the usual mindless quests, i.e., go kill a certain amount of monsters and get a certain amount of items.  Leveling is boring and easy for the first ten levels. At level 10, you are given "talent points" so that you can invest them in 3 trees of development. This is probably the only redeeming part of character development, because it does allow for more character differentiation. It is not enough, however, to save this mediocre game.  Leveling constitutes completing a series of mind-numbing quests, which most likely, you'll rarely read, except to find out where to go and what you need to get. Any story "told" through the quest text is sleep-inducing anyhow.  After you finally reach level 60 (if you are able to stand the boredom and repetitiveness) you can look forward to "end-game" content. This of course, requires you to actually belong to a decent guild. Odds are, however, that you'll be in one of the crappy guilds who get eaten alive in the harder game instances.  In a nut-shell, after 60, you can look forward to either not being able to do the end-game instances or doing them over and over again, in order to get phat lootz, purplz, etc. Getting a full set of epic gear will take you a long time, so expect to do BWL at least a full year before you are able to get 8/8 of any of the epic armor sets. Yay, I hope you look forward to mindless repetition of these instances, over, and over again.	-1
I'm sorry to say this, but this game is pathetic, and the level of fame that developer BioWare has gained over it really saddens me. Now, I'll admit that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan (read: I saw one movie when I was eight), but I am a huge RPG fan, and this game plummets far below my expectations. I will describe my experience with the game, and hopefully you will choose to pass it by and skip the agony I went through.  At the start of the game, I was asked to choose my character's appearance, skill point allocation, and basic moveset. Sounds fun and cool, right? That's what I thought, too. Until I realized that every character model was blocky and pseudo-realistic (you know, that weird, pale, supposed-to-look-human-but-really-doesn't look), the skill-point system was convoluted and confusing to anyone who isn't a hardcore Dungeons and Dragons player, and choosing my moves was so difficult and frustrating that in the end, I didn't even know which ones I had. Creating the character took an hour, and I didn't feel at all satisfied after I finished.  Once I started the actual game, things only got worse. I headed to my first battle, expecting a standard turn-based system at the least, and an innovative action/RPG blend at the most. I got neither. Instead, I was greeted a bizarre mess. In fact, this combat system was so strange and awkward that I don't think I could even describe it. All I know is that, first off, my character was somehow moving on its own, and second, the commands I entered didn't seem to effect what happened onscreen at all.  After making my way through several battles, by way of random button mashing and liberal use of medpacks (that was the easiest way to do it, and seemed to have the same result as trying to concentrate and strategize), I met my first party member. What happened after that just plain scared me. First, the voiceovers made me want to both laugh and scream. Secondly, while the horrendous voice is grating your ears, you have to look at a disturbing close-up of the character's face as he's talking. And finally, THE FACE DOESN'T CHANGE. His expression stayed exactly the same throughout the entire conversation, and this happened with every single other character I talked to. Freaky.  The final part of the game that I played through was the first city. It was big, with lots of people walking around, going about their lives. This would be cool, if I had known where to go in this massive maze. But did I? Nope. Although my horribly-voiced partner apparently knew the city well, I recieved no guidance from him. Instead, he followed me around, giving me no hints but the instruction to "find Bastilla". By the way, I knew nothing about what Bastilla looked like or where she might be.  After twenty minutes of running around in the maze, talking to random, badly-voiced people, most of whom had mean things to say, I gave up. Maybe people who like Star Wars and D&D will appreciate this, but I just can't. BioWare, quit pretending you're the next great RPG maker and go back to putting your characters in MTV music videos.	-1
The only reason I bought this game is because it had this so called "game of the year" thingy. You can't even attack, whats up with that. I'm a big boy, I can fight for myself I don't need the Xbox doing it for me. After an hour all I got done was making my stupid charater then I found out that you can't attack. Practicly the whole game is talking, talking, talking It's like The Social gathering game gone wrong. Do yourslef a favor and don't buy it. Its a total waste. Da** u Lucas arts.	-1
I was told by some friends how great this game is and I bought it and played and for awhile I though it was good. Then after the second day I got tired of it. Now I never want to play this game again, worse I can't return the game. I am going to cancel my subscription in the next two days or so before they send me my first monthly bill. Really disappointing. I went back to playing Battlefield 2/Special Forces I will stick with that game until they come out with something better. Best part is that game is free to play online unlike this game. Get it and you will enjoy it.	-1
I agree with the two of the previous reviewers. One gave it 5 stars because he's only about to reach lv22. The other gave similar comments as my title. They are both right but you really need to have reached lv60 and gone through some of the 40 man raid instances to see the complete picture.  If you are looking for a fun game to play for about 2-3 months, this may be the perfect game for you. However, if you are looking  for an online game that can be played for 1-2 years, this is not the one unless you have a lot of free time like 40 hours a week.  Although they claim to have 5 million subscribers, I am sure many of the accounts are already inactive or will be inactive soon.  That is said. From Lv1 to Lv60, I really had a lot of fun playing this game. Some of the quests are repetitive and boring, but you can choose to skip most of them. Most of the 5 men instances are very fun and unique compare to their peers. It is also relatively easy to get 5 people together to run an instance.  You will be leveling up at a reasonable pace and enjoying all the fun part of the game, new cool weapons, new monsters to fight, and many interesting new moves to kill the monsters or your pvp opponents. However, once you hit level 60, you only have 4 5-men instances and 1 10 men instance that you can farm over and over again to get your "class-specific" gears and some other cool gadgets. Once you've been through all of them several times, you will want to experience the "40 men raid instances" just out of curiousity. That's when you need a guild because those instances not only take a long time, but also require a specific game plan for each boss in them. If you play a hybrid class such as paladin,  shamen, druid, you are forced to be doing healing all the time. Sounds boring?  But raiding those instances is pretty much the only way to get better gears so that you can be better equipped to raid another, more difficult raid instance that they keep adding. In addition to that, you have to invest a huge amount of time every week if you want to get those "better gears", otherwise they will be given to the "raiders" who are able to commit longer hours. This makes it really difficult to people who have jobs and families to take care of. If playing a game becomes a burden that's heavier than a full-time job, why do you want to keep playing? Blizzard is adding new PvP rewards that are comparable to the gears from raid instances soon. However, you still have to invest similar amount of time every week in order to get those--you have to be top 3 ranked Pvper to get them.  Overall, this game does give you a lot of fun for a while. However the fun really lasts much shorter than what you get from another Blizzard product---Diablo 2.	-1
This game starts with the premise that the casual gamer can advance relatively easily and in a fun, meaningful way. You can, even as a casual gamer, reach the current level cap of 60 (Will be 70 when the expansion comes out later this year). The quests are fun and grouping is fun. The scenery is wonderful and the animations are quite good as well.  All of that changes at level 60.  Thanks to the game designers Jeff Kaplan and Alex Asfrasiabi, 2 ex-EQ1 hardcore guild raiders, this game shifts into overdrive at level 60. These two 16hr/day EQ1 idiots have managed to turn this game into a HUGE timesink raidfest at level 60. To put it mildly: If you don't have a hardcore raiding guild and aren't willing to put in anywhere from 4-6 hours nightly EVERY night, you'll be sitting around the capitol cities with your fingers up your rear doing absolutely NOTHING. Let me state that again: If you don't have 30-60 hours per week at level 60 to put into this game, you will be running the same low level instanced dungeons over and over...and over..and over..and over..and over..and over..and over again.  They keep adding content but for whom? You guessed it: The hardcore elite. There is a ton of content that you, if you are a casual gamer, will never see. Nice of them to introduce new dungeons, bosses, loot etc that 80%+ of the playerbase won't see, eh?  Thanks Jeff! Thanks Alex ASSfrasiabi!	-1
It's a solid, full experience, but the fact that you're not taking any active role in the fights detracts from what otherwise is a fully realized world. Those looking for a Star Wars RPG will love this, as I'm sure many RPG lovers will. But after playing such Star Wars games as Jedi Academy, Bounty Hunter and Jedi Outcast, I was disappointed, that you couldn't just run in and start attacking foes with either a lightsaber or take aim and fire your choice of weapon. Rather, you can only target, and WATCH as your character slowly exchanges fire with enemies who don't move even an inch in any direction as you fire, duck, he fires, you fire, he fires, you fire, etc. etc. I've never been much of an RPG fan nor a fan of the Final Fantasy series which seems like the Holy Grail of RPGs, so perhaps that's why, the battle scenes disappoint me. Not a game worth buying for anything more than half of the original retail price.	-1
I bought this game thinking that I could play it on my own.  Nope.  Once you pay the fourty bucks for it, then you get the privilege of paying a monthly fee to play because it is only an on-line game.  Nothing mentioned in the Amazon ad about that.  I returned the game, and Amazon was very fair regarding a refund.  I think that all on line games are basically a rip off since it forces you to have to play to get your money's worth, which never happens because you always have to pay more!  Sorry, I am not into dealing with that since I have a life.	-1
Do not buy this. SOE shut down the servers years ago.	-1
These items should be pulled from amazon.  after September 15th, 2011 all new star wars galaxies account codes are no longer able to be used.  The game is shutting down on the 15th of December and new players are no longer allowed to enter the game.  If you buy this you will not be able to have access to what you paid for so unless you just want the box then you should not buy this.  Repeat: No one who buys a new cd key for Star Wars Galaxies will be able to enter the game and any account who has not been active as of September 15th 2011 will NOT be able to reactivate and enter the game.  Please be aware.	-1
On June 24, Sony and Lucas Arts announced that the game would be shut down as of DEC 15, 2011.  If you buy this game, you will not get value for your money	-1
I'm fairly a newbie to Role Playing Games (RPG) and to gaming in general. I heard a lot about world of warcraft (WOW) before trying it out.  I only tried it because I got a free trial from gamespy website. I took one look at it and was completely turned off by the cartoonish graphics and the fact that everybody in the game looked like monsters. I was starting to turn away from RPGs in general but I read some good reviews on Amazon about Guild Wars (GW) and decided to try it out to see if there was anything to it.  Guild Wars blew me completely away. It rocks! I am totally addicted to it now. GW has extremely beautiful, realistic graphics. I mean exquisite! And the only monsters you see in it are the ones you have to fight. I know I end up writing a review for Guild Wars but I can't help it.  WOW probably is a good game but I will never play it because I can't deal with the cartoon graphics and all the people looking like monsters. Moreover, $15 DOLLARS A MONTH! Get outta here. Not me. Guild Wars is much, much better------and it's free to play.	-1
Buying Star Wars Galaxies: $20  Installing and patching the game: 2 hours  Realizing that the manual you read during that time along with the strategy guide that you picked up talk about an entirely different SWG than the one you are playing and are thus useless?  Priceless.  There are some games that are fun and rewarding to play.  For everything else - there's Sony.  Sony Online Entertainment has turned this game into a severely bugged shadow of it's former self.  A new first-person-combat system similar to planetside was shoved into the game, breaking the previous systems and returning the game to an Alpha-state.  If you're fine paying $15 per month for what is essentially an alpha-test on servers which are devoid of all but 10 - 15 players at a time, by all means; pick this up.  If you value the money you work for and would like to play what this game is trying to be - spend your money on Battlefront 2 instead.  If you want a decent MMORPG, I suggest anything not marketed by Sony Online Entertainment.  Worst customer service ever.	-1
This game used to be cool, and one of the Best MMO's out there.  However, in the past few months, Sony Online Entertainment has completely scraped the original game coding and rewritten it from scratch.  There used to be 30+ professions to play, and players used to be able to mix them and be hybrids.  Now there are only 9 professions, and players are stuck in their jobs... You wanna be a Smuggler, great your a smuggler, only there is no smuggling existent in the game... and you can't play your favorite Stars Wars musical instrument anymore in the Cantina's... as a side job.  The Combat System in the game has been overhauled at least twice in the last few months, the original system completely scraped and re-coded from scratch.  All these changes to the game are forced upon the players by SOE, and the players have to download them from SOE's servers to make sure their installed version is up to date with SOE's version.  Some of the downloads take hours, some even days for Dial Up users.  I have to burn all the downloaded updates into a CD or DVD for a friend of mine, and mail them to her because she gets them quicker that way.. because her Dial Up takes 36+ hours to download the biggest updates, and she can only let the download run for a few hours a day.  The game, at the present time... November 21st, 2005... the Game sucks.  SOE keeps promising changes to make things better, but they're either not coming fast enough for the players... or they just never come out with the cxhange at all... Smuggler's have been waiting 2 years now for the "promised" ability to be able to Smuggle in the game... Players are cancelling their accounts left and right.  SOE, on the day of their latest, and largest recode of the game... two weeks ago, Fired their Community Correspondent (Tiggs, a very popular person with the players) who is their voice between us the Players.. and them... because they didn't like what she was telling them what we were saying about the changes.  The game is supposed to be set in the timeperiod between the first two, Original Movies... Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back...  Yet LucasArts is producing the Expansions for this game and they keep pushing in Episode II and III content... instead of content designed for the correct time line.  Not only that, the new Clone Wars Content... is far better then the current timeline content... which supposed to be 20 years more advanced.  Jedi's... You wanna play a Jedi... this should be called, Star Wars: KOTOR Online.  The Jedi Population is out of control and it was SOE's biggest mistake to allow players to become Jedi's...  They should have left that as a rarity in the game, only had a few NPC Jedi's like Luke Skywalker in the game, as novelties for offering special Quests...  But no... they wanted to let players be Jedi's as a selling point.  How many Jedi did you see charging across the Hoth Battle Field with Luke, to take down the Imperial Walkers?  In Star Wars: Galaxies... there will be several hundred of them out there on Hoth... if SOE and LucasArts ever gets around to adding Hoth.  They're too busy adding Episode II and III content like the planets Kashyyyk and Mustafar... speaking of which, if you're a Jedi then you can go to Mustafar and help save Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost; whose "lost his way" ... how lame is that?  Now, they can't remove the Jedi from the game like they should.. because they hyped up being Jedi so much that "everyone and their mother" has one, or has played one... and would cry, bitch and comlain if SOE removed them.  SOE is "claiming" all these changes are making the game feel more "Star Wars" like... however within the last two weeks they have destroyed the in-game player economy, destroyed the orininal 30 Player Professions and redesigned 9 new ones... removed the ability to play a Hybrid Profession.. and turned the game into a massive online FPS that seems like it is based off of the KOTOR Timeline, instead of the Timeline it is supposed to be based off of... and ruined the combat system.  Do not buy this game.  If you want to play a Star Wars game, go play one of the Console Games like Star Wars: KOTOR series... or the new BattleFront series.  At present, this is probably one of the worst Star Wars Games ever made now.  It is all thanks to mismanagement and bad design ideas at SOE and  LucasArts... who both seem to think they can use this game to completely rewrite all of Star Wars history.  Maybe, someday in the future they'll get smart and fix this game... but for now... George Lucas ought to be ashamed of this game, it is an embarrassement to the Star Wars Universe.	-1
I have played Star Wars: Galaxies for 782 days according to the /getvet command. I have purchased all of the expansions out to date. I was considering creating a second account. As of 11-17-05 my account is cancelled. The New Game, also known as the Starter Kit, is the third version of SWG and it is riddled with bugs and incomplete. It is a far inferior product to its previous versions as well. The NG was released after being kept secret for an unknown period of time and allowing players only a two week notice of it being published. Even less time was devoted to it being tested by sources outside of SOE. Trials of Obi Wan and the NG were released in such a manner as to call into question SOE's and LA's ethics. As represented by the employees who post to the forums SOE and LA are uncarring, glib, and/or vastly out of touch with the player community.  Most of these are not new complaints. However, with the release of the NG these problems have escalted to such a degree that the game is no longer playable. While some are content to merely switch games I am not. Simply changing the direction of the flow of money to SOE and LA will not get their attention. I am boycotting all products created by Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts. I encourage others to do the same.  I do not think my actions alone with effect SOE or LA one iota. In fact, I doubt anything will change their policies. The fan base for Star Wars and other properties is sufficiently numerous to mitigate any discontent portion. While some have predicted that the NG will cause the collapse of SWG I believe otherwise. It will lose many current players but those will be replaced by SOE's and LA's new target market. SOE and LA will later use the negative comments and future subscriptions numbers to prove that they were right all along and to dismiss anyone who opposes them as being knee jerk reactionaries who are against change just because they don't like change. Because most likely the next expansion will also bring a new version of SWG as SOE and LA attempt to copy whichever game is doing better then.	-1
Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided  *Sigh* Where to begin...  This game could be better named: "Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base".  Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one (I've canceled my account and will NEVER do business with SOE again!).  *Wave Hand* "This is not the game you are looking for... Move along!"  PLEASE, READ ON...  In the beginning... This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the "Star Wars" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any "Smuggler" in the game for their opinion.  They strung us along and led us to believe that the "fixes" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an "Expansion Pack" to sell us! And then once again "promised us" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, "just hang on, this game is going to be great!" They promised us that they were going to do this "Combat Upgrade" and do it right, and it "wouldn't be released until it's ready!"  We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figured out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...  Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited "CU" would be coming out along with the "Rage of the Wookiees" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the "CU" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...  They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could "streamline" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!  The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?  The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or "EverStar Galaxies QuestWars" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. I'm sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detail.  As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.  This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.  Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying. People are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!  SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.  You have been warned!	-1
I loved this game. When I first played it as a demo a year ago I immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game. I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.  I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called "Combat Upgrade" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.  So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003. It breaks my heart that I have lost so many friends and a great experience, but this game is truly forsaken. It is not the same game anymore, it is completely different. If you want Star Wars, take it from me: this is no longer it, and is not worthy of anyone's hard-earned cash.	-1
In 1977 I was four years old.  My mom says she took me to see the first Star Wars in the theater but I don't remember it.  I DO remember ESB and ROTJ.  And I certainly remember growing up in that time where THE toys to have were Star Wars related.  My point?  I grew up waiting for a game like SWG.  When it came out in 2003 I was ecstatic and I've been playing it ever since.  Sure, there were always problems with it, but what MMO pleases everyone all the time?  Yet I stuck with it through some very rough spots because I had faith that no matter how bad it got it would always get better.  After all, who could screw up Star Wars?  Well, now I have the answer to that question.  SOE can, apparently.  I played EQ and watched as it devolved into a game for uberleet lewt wh*res, so perhaps I should've seen this coming.  I'm torn whether I'm to blame for my naivete or SOE is for their abominable handling of the Star Wars license.  In the end it doesn't matter.  Because the bottom line is that SOE has absolutely crushed its playerbase with the recent "Combat Upgrade".  It used to be that the game economy was player based.  No longer.  Crafters can barely step outside their houses lest they get one-shot killed by a creature that resembles a bunny.  Insert Monty Python joke here, if you please.  It used to be that combatants had some solo content and wouldn't have to spend hours finding and maintaining groups.  No longer.  Soloing in the game is frustrating at best, impossible at worst.  It used to be that the vast majority of equipment worth having was made by player crafters.  And while that may still be true, with every patch and "upgrade" it becomes less true as SOE desperately courts those for whom loot is the only thing in the game worth pursuing.  It used to be that patches and upgrades for SWG, while never bug free, at least were given a reasonable amount of time in the Test Center for beta testing.  No longer.  The CU was released with almost no substantive beta testing.  What little beta testing DID exist made utterly no difference, as the feedback from beta testers was completely ignored.  I could go on, but what's the point, really?  The bottom line is that SWG, as it exists now, is a terrible, terrible game.  Buyer beware.  Buyer be-VERY-ware.  I am a longtime gamer and you can trust me when I tell you that your hard-earned money is best spent outside of SOE's coffers.	-1
Did I miss something? I'm at a complete loss as to how this game has been receiving such rave reviews.  I agree with the other reviewer: the "game" consists of walking ten feet, meeting an NPC, then interviewing them with what seems like an endless (and mostly pointless) conversation.  Then you walk another ten feet, meet another character, and start all over again. Occasionally, you run into someone you have to attack, but the combat is so boring that it makes watching a bunch of senior citizens playing golf look like extreme sports. Simply hit "yes" when asked if you want to attack, and then just sit and watch, and hope your complete lack of participation somehow affects the outcome.  So join the excitement of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Talk! Then, talk some more! Then, fight by pressing "X" (once). Then, talk yet again! Don't just do something, stand there!	-1
I bought this game for 49.99 and took it back the next day because I found it to be painfully boring and virtually unplayable online.  I then decided to give it another chance and bought it used for 17.99.  Nothing has changed. I should have saved my 18 bucks. First off I would like to say that the graphics in this game are excellent, but that is where the good ends.  If you have this game on PC, then don't waste your money on this.  It is virtually the exact same game, with more cumbersome controls.  Nothing compares to a keyboard and mouse and this couldn't be more true for this game.  The pace and speed of this game is not suited for anything other than a keyboard/mouse combo.  It seems Atari rushed this game out without taking the controls into consideration. Now for the XBOX Live portion, which is probally the reason most people bought this game.  First of all, finding a game on the servers can be a bit of a chore.  When you do actually select a game to play, you have to cross your fingers to hope that the game will actually let you in.  More often than not, you will be booted from the server before you actually join the game!  Expect to try at least 10 times before actually getting in a game. When you FINALLY get in a game, besides the lag in 80% of the games, you will almost immediately see that the game is nothing more than pure "chaos" as reviewer "ultimatexhammer" so acurately put it.  This game requires NO skill.  Just get a rocket launcher and fire away at random targets.  Sometimes you'll hit your enemy most of the times you won't.  And don't even think about stopping to actually aim at an enemy; chances are you'll be dead before you even get to shoot.  The weapons in this game are cool and all (minus the sniper rifle replacement), however you rarely have enough time to select them and use them correctly due to the cumbersome controls and the fact that this game is pure luck for the most part.  You get the occasional gamer that performs extremely well online, but for the most part this game is nothing but running around and shooting at anything that moves hoping that someone does not shoot you in the back for the 100000th time.  And if this wasn't bad enough, some custom levels actually have enhanced laser cannons that kill you in one shot no matter where it hits you. If you thought you died fast in normal games, imagine dying as soon as you spawn over and over and over again.  No fun at all. The other games on UC, like bombing run and capture the flag would be fun because in theory they require strategy.  But again this game is too chaotic and random for any strategy to ever be a factor in these games either. To bluntly put it, this game is boring. If no skill, random dying and ultimate chaos is your cup of tea, then you will feel right at home with UC.  Otherwise stay clear of this game.  It wasn't worth 49.99 and it is not worth 17.99 either.	-1
This game is really fun, for about the first 30 minutes.  You quickly come to the realization that once you've played the four or five available games you've basically seen it all.  Sure you can choose different characters and different weapons, and different teamates, but it doesn't really change anything.  As a rental game Unreal Championship is worth a weekend rental, but if you buy it you will be stuck thinking about what else you could have done with that $$.	-1
I have been playing this game for half a year now, and even though I have had fun, I am beggining to question the point of 15 dollars a month.  There are tons of problems with the game that haven't been fixed or are being created. For one, Ironforge is basically unraidable, because the lag is unbearable. Noone wants to raid Ironforge because you can't even move without waiting. Another thing, killing lowbies doesn't give dishonorable kill points. Quite a few times I have seen level 60 alliance players kill a bunch of level 20's at the Morshan Rampart(a place where people can PvP in a specific zone, but as soon as you leave that zone there might be some level 60's waiting to murder you). Blizzard still hasn't fixed the guards yet, so many players stand the chance of being murdered upon exiting the Warsong Gulch.  Even worse, there aren't that many items. After playing so long, you soon start to see the same models in the same armor every day. Everyone looks the same practically, and most higher level players have practically the same armor sets now. I have seen so many people with the Dreadmist Rainment that it is laughable. If you use two-handed swords, I bet you probably have a Destiny.  Worse yet, the community is filled with younger kids who still don't know how to play at level 60. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a level 60 warrior pull 50 monsters and yell at the group when he dies. There are so many little kids. The new thing seems to be farming kills in the Warsong Gulch. What many of these kids don't realize is the fact that after you kill someone a few times in one day, you don't get any more honor from them. So in essence, they are wasting their own time trying to farm kills.  This game is not worth 15 dollars a month. People bash Everquest, but if you pay 10 dollars a month you get EQ and any other SOE game that is online for that same 10 dollars. This game's flaws could be overlooked, but the pricing is just too steep.	-1
First the good.  The game is quite pretty, and contains a great amount of character an personality.  Unlike others, I kind of like the cartoony look.  I like the different styles and voices and environments of the different races.  Bottom line is, the graphics and sound people who worked on this game did a top notch job.  That's about the only thing that went right though.  The game starts out fun enough.  The interface and playing is easy and  intuitive, so its not hard to play the game and feel like you're doing a good job.  The game gets repetative really fast, but if you're playing an MMO that's (so far) unavoidable.  Instead of grinding on a bunch of creatures for just xp, 90% of the game is sending you on quests that say "go kill 30 of crfeature X"; aka grinding with a purpose...sort of.  After a while the game's flaws start to become more apparent.  There are LARGE balance issues between the classes.  The professions are bugged so sometimes you can't advance in them any further, and even if you could, they're by and large useless by the end of the game (engineering being the exception, and cooking if you're a hunter).  There's still an inordinate amount of bugs that really hamper gameplay (for instance, if a mage gets hit when using his ice block talent, he will be disconnected from the server).  On top of it all, the servers are still unstable.  It might be forgiveable if this was still release, but I'm writing this review after the game has been out for 7 months.  Blizzard has taken little to no steps to fix any of the problems with the game, instead doing nothing for long periods of time, and then introducing new features which either exacerbate old problems or create entirely new ones.  The developement team makes no direct contact with the community, but instead uses a group of community managers who are just glorified forum moderators.  I've been a big fan of every blizzard game so far except diablo 2 (it was terrible until the 1.1 patch they released 3(?) years later), so this was a huge letdown.  The game's got potential (like I said, lots of character), but I've spent $70 worth of monthy fees waiting for them to fix the game, and I don't recomend anyone else paying a monthly fee waiting for them to finish developing the game.  If diablo 2 was any indication, hold off on this game for another 3 years and (if it's still around) it will probably be a decent game by then.	-1
This game had little to offer in the First-person shooter (FPS) genre. The graphics are pretty mediocre and the AI is nothing fancy. The single player mode lacks any sort of story or development. The different game modes, while generally fun, are nothing new. The controls are pretty good, but the action moves a little unrealisticlly (no pun intended). Weapons don't require reloading, so the action seems a bit over-exagerated. I haven't played this game on x-box live, so I'm passing no judgment in that respect. But as a FPS, this game suceeds in breaking no new ground. Nor does it really push the limits of x-box's potential.	-1
The game was playable before the combat Revamp. No, things weren't perfect. I played for 2 years, and personally discovered every inconvienient bug in the game, from having my money dissappear, to being killed repeatedly because I couldn't fight back. But now, I am ready to give up. The customer support has gone from bad to either nonexistant, or blatantly antagonistic, and 9/10 the professions in the game no longer work at all. the other 1/10 work partially. And forget it if you try and make a new character. It is impossible to level. This from a guy that went from novice to master rifleman in 5 days in the old system without working hard.	-1
As an experienced gamer and sometime online gamer, I have to say I was blown away the first couple of times I played WOW.  The graphics are super, the world is populated by interesting and often funny characters (Love the Dwarves), and Blizzard's support of user-created interfaces such as Cosmos is admirable.  With that said, I have to say I was also blown away by how awful the support is for this game.  After several months of playing, I'm cancelling my subscription.  I'll be doing that as soon as I can log on to the WOW site which has not been up the last 3 times I have tried.......  Blizzard requires elaborate firewall settings to download updates (They have been frequent) and has yet to address the frequent and irritating lag issues on some servers; not to mention the frequent and equally irritating crashes resulting in extended periods of not being able to access the game - something you are paying for....  Recently, 45 days after sending an e-mail to customer support (After being asked to do so) regarding a server latency issue, I received a response asking for more information.  Incredible! I had since started characters on another server and not experienced the same issue so I know the server was to blame....  The game was not ready to launch and Blizzard was not prepared for the massive response to the launch.  The myriad of "game of the year" designations are not deserved.  Those that enjoy paying to be a playtester should love WOW.  If you rather enjoy playing games to escape a bit and enjoy yourself, look elsewhere - at least for the time being.	-1
When the game came out things worked pretty well.  The glowing reviews were well deserved.  But with each passing day since, the bugs and stability have gotten worse.  It has now gotten to the point that the servers go down everyday.  And each time the servers go down the length of time they are down gets longer. Most of the time the servers are down for a few minutes to a couple of hours. Today it is now approaching 12 hours downtime and that is for nearly half the servers and the most popular ones.  It wouldn't be that bad if the downtimes were when most people were not playing.  But the downtimes almost always occur in the evening at the peak player times.    There are many bugs that many players know about and go unfixed.  It has become the old doctor joke.  You know, the patient says "Doctor, it hurts every time I do this" and the doctor says "Don't do that".  That is how many players play the game, there are many things we are supposed to be able to do but when we do it the game locks up or crashes, among other things. So we avoid doing certain things. Again, with each passing day more and more bugs appear.    The PVP(player versus player) system in the game is probably the worst and most pointless of any online only game in existence. This can be especially frustrating for players trying to level on a PVP server. There is supposed to be a system that punishes players from killing other players of a significantly lower level.  This is called "ganking". After the first couple of areas on a PVP server you enter areas that are PVP enabled, meaning the other faction can attack you.  Unless you have very high level players with you, you will be "ganked" and many times.  Which makes it very hard to level and complete missions in these areas.  After about level 15 you enter the PVP enabled areas.  When you do PVP with players of nearly equal level there is no reward for winning or punishment for losing.  You also do not gain any experience.  It is pointless. The community has been screaming to Blizzard to give PVP meaning. Blizzard was supposed to have a meaningful PVP system in place when the game was released and have promised this ever since the game came out.  But, again, with each passing day, we are told something is coming soon.  We are still waiting.    All things considered, with the server instability, the bugs and the meaningless PVP system I would suggest waiting to buy the game at this time.  I would wait about 3 to 6 months, check the latest reviews(make sure you read the date the reviews were submitted, don't be fooled by reviews that were written when the game first came out) to see if things have improved.  (Edited August 13, 2006)  As you can see the original review was written over a year ago.  What has happened since then?  If I didn't know better, it almost appears that Blizzard had my concerns at the top of the list for things to address.  The game works almost flawlessly, with only the occasional down time, lags and bugs.  But honestly what MMO doesn't have these problems?  WOW now works as good or better than any MMO.  Some people now say the PVP is the best part of the game and it is something that everyone should give a try, especially the PVP haters, you may be surprised how much you like it.  Kudos to Blizzard for doing it right!	-1
I loved this game, i looked forward to playing it anytime i could, but now after the update it realy sucks..it has NOTHING to do with the movies.  After the Combat upgrade the game went down hill, they added alot of silly things from the EverQuest 2 game that does NOT make any sence at all in starwars..and its far 2 buggy.  I will give them a little tiem to fix it and take it away ( and I guess they will not cause they are so smart ) bah!  Help Lucas where are you?!  Starwars was a more serious game, playd by both young AND old..noe people are leaving in hordes..50 % of the Chimaera server left cause of the Combat upgrade..old players..are getting rare in soem places...they go to Guild wars or WoW..  So overall play for my part is runined in this game, and I do not see if a layal fan don't even like it ( yes i like fanatasy, but this in SWG now is just silly )anyothers will think its a crap game.  Please Lucas! take charge! let us have back the star wars as in the movies, we don't want Star Quest ( as starwars now looks like everQuest..which sux and is silly )  so save yer money buy World of warcraft or Guildwars!   :(	-1
This game [is bad]. It is the worst game I have ever played. the point of the game is to shoot the choppy aliens with your green glowing balls before they shoot you with their red glowing balls of DEATH! Its a game that people should be executed over making. (or selling? :) )  So please for your sake DON'T BUY THIS GAME IT [IS BAD]!!!! Rent it first so you can agree with me.	-1
OK... MIB is a very good concept for movies and games, but this title isn't the best (FOR FAR), but isn't the worst... an for my point of view this is the Pros and Cons Pros 1-Real Challenging game... when you sit in front your TV... you must do 2 things.... first, quit like a looser... or move fast ant try to end the level... 'cause theres no way that you can save your progress during the level. 2- Graphics... could be better. 3-Bosses, I already finished 4 levels and the bosses are not so difficult... but reach them is the pain in the ... Cons... 1- The music... oooouuuuchhhh!!![...], some times you will think on turn off the volume. 2- The caracters... where is Tommy Lee and Will Smith... 3- The Voices...same thing 4- Keep the upgrades on your weapons... is real difficult... when you reach their maximun power is very easy to kill a dozen of aliens... but each time that you get shoot, you loose your upgrades... 5- The SAVE thing... why you cant save your progress during the level? So please save yourself [...]... and rent it. OR IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT::: I SELL MINE just [...]...:-)	-1
The game had great potential. They started to make some nice changes to the game mechanics and content that started to really improve things. Then came the Combat Upgrade. That is marketing speak for total game revamp. The gameplay has completely changed. Now the non-combat players cannot do business because they cannot get the items they need to craft without hiring player body guards. This is just unforgivable. They went from a Star Wars game to a EverQuest game with laser guns and glowing baseball bats.  Players wanted tweaks not a complete overhaul. Save your money or play something like World of Warcraft. Customer service is the worst I have ever seen, and I have played and tested around six other online RPGs.	-1
No use buying it now, Sony killed the game off with the Combat Upgrade. It was so much better before, but these clowns have taken a great game and just hacked it all apart.	-1
Before anyone votes me "not helpful" bc they disagree with my review for whatever reason, let me say that I've been a diehard Blizzard fan since 1993 when Warcraft 1 started me down the computer path.  So if there is bias here, it is in their favor.  So on to the review.  This game is the best I think I have ever played.  It is ... well massive, the graphics are great, there are hundreds of quests for each race/class combo (so some Tuaren/Elf/whatever, some warrior/priest/whatever), and the professions add a new dimension to the game.  I think I had more fun mining and blacksmithing then questing for awhile.  There is a profanity filter (on by default, easy to turn off), and auction house to sell things to others ... the list of amazing accomplishments goes on for miles.  But then you try to play.  Blizzard just posted news regarding a hardware "upgrade" that coincided with enough lag, disconnections, and game simply crashing to desktop (how server hardware accomplished that I don't know but it started happening at the same time - I changed nothing) to make the game simply unplayable.  The server my main character is on had an 858-person queue last night (45+ minute wait), so I went to the server with my alternate character.  Lockups, server rollbacks that make you redo portions of the game, disconnections, lag.  Combine massive queues with game crashes and you get to sit there staring at your monitor trying not to scream.  Tonight I was simply greeted with the "Authenticating" message for many long minutes before giving up (usually takes 5 seconds tops), and this is far from the first time.  Before you think, "wow, what a winer. This will all be over in a week or so", just keep in mind that Blizzard opened up service to South Korea yesterday.  South Korea = tens of thousands of power gamers.  So yes, the game is incredible in many ways, including how much fun it is.  But it is a SUBSCRIPTION-based game.  That means you pay to play online.  Online games aren't much fun when you can't log in.  Take my advice and WAIT.  This game is only getting better and since you get a month free service and then pay (about 13 clams/month), you don't want to be sitting here paying for nothing like me.  Now I think I'm going to go play Warcraft 2 for awhile.	-1
I have been playing MMOG since 97 - UOL , EQ , AC , AC 2 , DAoC , AO , SWG , WWIIOL , EQ2 , NWN ... you name it .  Besides every off line RPG there ever was - from Ultima 2 to Morrowind  I knew already before buying WoW that I would not like this game but have wanted to make the experience anyway .  The game box wandered to the garbage bin as expected yesterday after 1 month of playing .  The griefs are so many that I will only take the most importants .  1)  The biggest grief is that the game is too easy .  There is no challenge , I can solo whatever I want .  Dying is not a problem (Ah ? Wasn't this thing supposed to be an RPG ?) , levelling is not a problem , winning any fight is not a problem , being stupid is not a problem , being asocial is not a problem .  Nothing is a problem .  Ok I have nothing against games being designed for very young kids , but I happen to not to be one .  I want my RPGs challenging , leveling difficult without being unfeasible , a minimum of thinking required , I am not afraid of failing from time to time .  WoW is failing here - it treats the players like somebody mentally handicapped , unable to face a challenge , unable to support the least frustration .  Yet it's because the things are sometimes difficult that overcoming them creates a very strong feeling of happiness .  Of course the DOSE of difficulty is important - 100 % leads to discouragement but 0 % is ridiculous .  2)  Low life duration .  I suppose that in some 6 months , everybody will have done about everything in this game .  What then ?  Garbage bin ? Then I won 5 months .  3)  No cooperation .  Playing this game or playing a single player off line game is about the same .  WoW somehow missed the M from Multiplayer part .  Well , yes there is still this (stupid) PvP part that I guess could be called Multiplayer .  But then there are better games if it was PvP I was interested in .  4)  Really s...y , ugly graphics and colors .  It is surely a matter of taste but there is a part of immersion and credibility involved with playing RPGs .  Nobody can get an immersion feeling with a world that looks like a cartoon with colors that come from some bad LSD trip .  Not to speak about credibility .  So has WoW no merits ?  No there is at least one .  WoW is to MMORPG what Harry Potter is to fantasy litterature .  Harry Potter is a (very) bad litterature in general and subpar fantasy at best .  However it's easy to read and a good introduction for kids who without that would probably finish like most people by reading 1 or 2 books a year .  So there is a hope that beginning by the easy part , they would come to appreciate later some more difficult reading .  Same with WoW .  It's the best way to get introduced in an easy way to RPGs and MMOG for those who are little if at all familiar with it .  Once they ate this huge sugar cake , they might begin to appreciate some more subtle meals later .	-1
Been playing the game since Beta adn though there have been other problems, when they ignored their entire playerbase to push a complete rewrite of the game to EQ standards they ruined it.  If you want to Play Starwars then I reccomend Knights of the Old republic or Battlegrounds.  If you want to play EQ/WOW with Starwarsy Characters then guess you will want to buy it.	-1
I wish this game was good, I've owned it for a long time, this is the first 1 I've given a game. Some people say this game is great, and, I don't really want to be rude, but they were either high or freshly released from the looney bin, or it could have been the first MMO they played, I have to be honest, I liked this game when I first played it, it was the first MMO I played, but after playing GOOD games like WoW or CoH or Ragnarok (yes Ragnarok is better) I was disgusted at the game, it should not have been made. I have to admit that it could have been more, but it isn't what it should have been, buy WoW or CoH... or Ragnarok, just DON'T play this game...	-1
This game sucks.  You kill and kill and kill and kill and you never go anywhere.  The player economy is a good idea but damn if its not hard to find people to buy really good stuff from.  The quests never produce decent items and its STILL got too many bugs.  As Akbar said, "It's a trap!"	-1
My wife and I bought this and dove into the Star Wars universe full of hope and expectation. After all, what can possibly be lacking in anything with the Star Wars name? Oh boy. Let me be a little technical first before giving my gut feelings... The INTERFACE was good at first glance. Not great, just good. It could have been far better. Some controls can be re-written, some can't and some re-written controls interfere with others when they aren't supposed to. For instance, chatting was a chore if you attempt to rekey anything on the keyboard. You don't want to be involved in a CHORE when you're fighting, talking and trying to stay alive. The PvP is jacked all to heck and back with just a couple of classes being way over-strengthed with "uber-rock-your-world-pwn" abilities and or equipment. There is no reason at all to engage in PvP unless you just want to hear the other guy scream obscenities at you. Plus, the game is overrun with pets. Don't bother picking a mano-a-mano fight - those don't exist. You have your pets do all the fighting. The WORLD is limited. A handful of planets with an area mapped out on each. Plenty of room to run around, but not much out there. Most of your time will be spent in cities getting killed over and over in spaceport. The GAMEPLAY is somewhat like AO. Players can take missions for money, exp and faction points. Unfortunately, the missions send you out to only 2 different types of mission points: either a metal outhouse with 3 guys around it, or a smoking pile of poop with several animals around it. The SWG game was bought from UO as the defunct UO2 system, so I understand, which is why the game is based on animals and skins and bones and gut puddings... The CRAFTING is at first impressive. At first. Both I and my wife took up crafting when we saw PvP was so pointless that we had nothing left to do. Diablo2 made my wrist ache sometimes, but no game like SWG has ever jacked my wrist all to heck. You WANT carpal tunnel? Play this game as a crafter. And I macroed as much as I could. The BUGS in this game have yet to be fixed... whole classes broken, whole faction perks broken, nerfs to anything that gets whined about on the official boards... what's the worst you can imagine? SWG has it. If you like the rebels, join this game. Rebels rule every single world in the SWG and walk the planets fully declared. The Empire has absolutely ZERO ballz in this universe. The Emporer is wetting his robe. Okay, my gut feelings... this game has been taken over by the Pokemon players. You want to PvP? Make sure you have some handy Poke-pets to whip out of your datapad and say "a". That's the game. There are hardly any droids to speak of and this is supposed to be Star Wars? This game is a joke. I watched Star Wars in its theater debut in the 70s. This game bears NO resemblance. Background effects of TIE engine whines don't count when the whole game is based on Pokemon. But hey, that's the majority of the audience... kids that grew up with Pokemon and liked it. SWG is Pokemon in Space and it won't ever change.	-1
So what does Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) bring to the table that a gamer who spent time with Everquest, Asheron's Call, Ultima Online and other classic MMORPG titles has never seen before?  Well, it does have some fairly organized non-combat gameplay mechanics including a built-in computerized buying and selling system that acts like EBAY for custom crafters. I also got a kick out of the ability to purchase harvesters which dig up incredible amounts of resources on all planets while your character levels up somewhere else.  I enjoyed tinkering around with some of SWG's non-combat options but that was really the only thing I found to do in the game.  At the time I played, there wasn't a single Jedi in the game but I hear that people are finally discovering (after almost a year of play!) how to become one.  I also hear that in the future, the game might add space combat and land vehicles which were a critical omission from the original game which leads me to my number one complaint, how can you create an MMORPG about Star Wars and leave out space?  That's like creating a Dungeons & Dragons MMORPG and leaving out magic. I'd like to spend more time telling you some of the pros and cons of this game but it bored me to death after two weeks of play.  And this is coming from someone that spent months on previous MMORPG classics. It doesn't offer the MMORPG gamer anything they haven't seen before and it probably has one of the most boring hack and slash leveling systems of all the MMORPG titles.  SWG still has a strong fan base and I'd recommend that Star Wars fans, diehard MMORPG fans (you know who you are), and MMORPG newbies give it the old college try but everyone else should save their money.  This game might be fantastic after three or four expansions which you know are coming considering it has the same developer that worked on Everquest, but it doesn't bring anything new to the quickly diminishing MMORPG genre which is imploding from its own repetitiveness.	-1
I had high hopes for this game.  I finally had broadband in my area, and what better way to test it than with online gaming, right?  The game in its current state can be summed up in one word: Boring. Run (or jog) for minutes at a time, look for needles in haystacks, kill vermin, and hope nobody kills you.  That's about it.  Sound adventurous?  No space travel.  No piloting of any craft.  You might get to ride a dewback, if you're lucky. I wish I could find someone to give my copy.  To get my money's worth I've given it a dual-purpose:  Door stop and paper weight. LucasArts and SOE really missed the mark with this one.	-1
For a substantial monetary output you get very little. The game requires a very high end machine to play on a minimum level. Everyone is a Rebel for the most part. Destroying the feel of the movies and the books. Pets dominate and vehicles we put in rushed and wrong recently. It is a game for online game folks and not for star wars fans. One observation: People play this game very seriously, if you're not that serious, other players will make the game less fun for you. Deliberately. I've played with a good group of folks, but they seem to be the exception to the rule.  I see folks ridicule others, especially kids, rather then help. Generally very poor development and support from SOE, mimicking their other game Planetside. I expect players to drop from SWG soon in the way droves left Planetside (requiring servers to be merged and other problems). If you are a die hard fan, or a kid whose parents are paying for everything - Go for it. Otherwise you will get little bang for your buck, other then some nice sounds (hence the second star) on a high end machine. On a mid-end machine you will not even get that from what I hear.  Just frustrations and a lot attempts to tweak your system to get it to work. If you are a parent, this game is a money trap. If you are a player, you're going to be dissapointed and wish you had spent the money for your three months trying to get into the game... on two other games (Jedi academy and Knight of the old republic some to mind)	-1
I had high expectations for Star Wars Galaxies, and who didn't?  It promised to be the revolution in MMORPGs.  But revolution it's not.  After the first 5 minutes of Galaxies, I knew I was in for a big nasty surprise.  First off, no one is in charactor, absolutely no one.  And if you want to talk to someone, you better type "WAIT!" as quick as you possibly can, because people move far too fast to talk to them as they go by.  Another problem out of the many Galaxies has, are the missions.  I mean...when I saw the caption "and now for the greatest Star Wars Saga ever told"  I figured I was in for an adventure.  What I was really in for, was farm labor...thats right, you find yourself working as a Rat Hitman half the time.  Normally the missions break down like, someone has a farm, and they need you to kill this nest of critters to save their crops. There are good things about this game, don't get me wrong.  In my travels, I saw alot of things that impressed me, for instance the cantinas and such.  However, I saw nothing that warrants a 50 dollar purchase.  I'm sure there are people with good arguments as to why this is a good game, however to me, I found it to be dull, poorly made, and glitchy. The point here is, this game is just not finished, there really isn't any other way to put it kindly.  They needed to release something, and it was released to early, with far too many cut corners.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but diehard fans of the series. PROS: Nice graphics Huge areas Factions lots of skills and weapons CONS: Glitches Lag Too many patches no one ic.	-1
I should make one thing clear before I kick off this review: I do not like MMORPGs.  I have never played a MMORPG that I liked, however I always go into these games with an open mind, so understand that this is not MMORPG bias i'm basing this review on. It had to happen sooner or later: Star Wars as a MMORPG.  I was very hyped up and very interested in this game for about 5 or 6 months.  Since I harbor such a strong dislike for Ever Quests, I dismissed this game initially as EQ in Space, but as I read on about all the features Star Wars would have, I was generally intrigued.  I bought the game on launch day, and the disappointment began.  The launch day problems were rampant, which is to be expected of course, since so many people were trying to get in that the servers were overloaded.  I was able to finally register and log in about a day after I got the game. Character Creation was decent...you can edit alot about the character, from body type to facial construction.  You choose from a few base classes, and then go on from there to expand the class and branch off into a more advanced class, such as Bounty Hunter or Weaponsmith or Commando.  What is good about this is that you can take a little bit from every class and mix and match it to design your very own unqiue character.  However, level progression is very slow, and it becomes necessary to teach your skills to others in order to progress.  Interesting concept, if a little flawed. There are no Jedi's running around yet, simply becuse the method of becoming a Jedi is a 'secret' which players have since discovered, but it is still difficult to do.  Thankfully this limits the Jedi population and keeps balance. As for the game itself, it just wasn't really that interesting.  The world is huge, but devoid of life.  Lots of quests require you to hump your way all the way across the planet for pathetic rewards and little experience points.  Other quests require you to destroy objects, like dirt mounds or junk piles, which creatures spawn out of.  What's bad is that these quests cannot possibly be undertaken alone, since attacking one of these mounds causes a tremendous group of creatures to gang up on you and tear you to pieces, and if you do manage to fend them off, there are other creatures healing the object, making your effort useless.  There are some quests unique to sides, if you join the Imperials or Rebels, which is a decent change, but its still the same: Find and Kill soandso, bring this item here, etc. etc. Items in the game are all made by players, which is utterly ridiculous.  There are no shops in the game at all, except for one Bazaar that holds player auctions.  Since everyone is making the same stuff, the same items appear over and over.  There are no unique items anywhere.  One of the problems with this is that making weapons and armor is a career for some players.  Funny, but that sounds like nothing more than a job to me.  I'll go to my real job if I want to be productive, thanks.  I'm sure many other players will begin to realize that too, and the items in the game will start becoming scarce. The game is just very monotonous, but I should expect no less from the makers of EQ.  Sure, its fun for the first few hours, when you're exploring and getting familiar with everything, but the experience degenerates quickly.  When I got this game, I was hoping to be surrounded by Star Wars nerds role-playing their characters...but I forgot that Role-Playing is not allowed in MMORPGS.  Try role-playing your character for one minute around other players and watch your text screen fill up with people screaming 'St0p r0lE PlAyinG j00 n00b!' and garbage like that.  Hence, the 'Wow, i'm in Star Wars' feeling wears off extraordinarily quick. The realization that this is just another online game and the fact that no one cares that its Star Wars becomes evident quickly, when you see players running around with names like 'Potthead Smokey' or 'Do0bi3 Sm0k3r' or 'L000k3 Skyywaalk3rrr123441' (all of which were names I actually saw).  Its the idiots like that which completely take away from the game experience.  You can barely understand what anyone is saying, because everyone talks in '1337 speech' or whatever the popular term for it is among the little kids.  Overall, I found the rampant childish behavior and boring, pointless gameplay to be a huge turn off.  I was off the game 3 days after getting it.  I really, really wanted to like this game, but in the end the boring gameplay just got on my nerves, and the immature players didn't particularly help much either.  This game was clearly just very over-hyped, and I was extraordinarily disappointed.  Luckily I didn't get slapped with the rather high (over $15) monthly fee since I was off the game in 3 days. If you want a great Star Wars Role Playing game, then I suggest checking out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic for XBox, or waiting for it to come to the PC.  Its a much better game, and well worth the money.  Since Galaxies doesn't really seem to qualify as a role-playing game, you're better off saving all the money you would waste on the hefty monthly fee.  A nice try, but i'm not impressed at all.  Just another run-of-the-mill Massive Online Game ruined by childish players and boring gameplay.	-1
You pay out the yeng yang for this game and then after you get it loaded, you discover that to get on-line to play you have to pay a monthly server fee!  I guess that will teach me to read the fine print...drat it, I totally missed that!!!  I suggest the game be cheaper to afford the monthly fees, or ix-nay the monthly server fees!  If you're not willing to fork out $65-$100 for a game, don't make the mistake that I did.	-1
I wrote a review when I first bought this game. I gave it 5 stars because of all the inovative ideas put into the game. I also raved about its excellent surrounding environment in the different planets you can chose to play in. I now take back what I have said with Part 2 of my SWG review. After noticing the fact that I used to play an hour a day, I was still just a novice pistoleer. Why is this? Because you have to play a LOT to become anywhere good in the game. A huge flaw in this game is that it takes no skill at all whatsoever. The entire game is based off of the amount of time clocked into your life to play. Your grandmother could play this game the rest of her life, knowing NOTHING about video games, and still do very well. Once past the steep learning curve in the game, all that stands in your way is time itself. If you have the time, then go ahead, no-lifer, play, play, play, and play, until you become a master marksman, or medic, or whatever. This isn't the worst problem though. The game is extremely repetative. Sure, going out with 15 people in Lok killing space bunnies with many different types of players is fun at first. Then you start to realize taht you can only make money by doing pointless missions and crafting weapons/armor for bigger and more extreme players. Alright, that isn't so much fun. Then we have the skill system. Possibly the only good part about the game, the skill system is a great way to mix skills to have more unique characters. Ok, you can be a master medic and a master pistoleer and a somewhat good creature handler, but what's after that? I don't know, absolutely nothing. Once you max out your skill points, the only thing else to do is to give up skills and start new ones (or if you are THAT good of a character, redo your skills again). Great, I am paying 15 dollars of my hard-earned money every month to learn max out about 12 different professions... Fun... And about that 15 dollars a month. Even within 2 months of release, servers are frequently down getting updated. Those 15 dollars are not going to the right places. When I had technical problems with the game, the SOE reps on the phone were not only giving me a big headache, but were so unprofessional that they were wasting my time, thus the 15 dollar phonecall to California that day. Atleast use that money to get better reps and to get people that actually know how to make good patches for the game. Then I might have considered keeping my account. Earlier I discussed repetativeness. Did I mention that there isn't one single vehicle that you are able to freely drive in this game? Sure, take a shuttle port to different cities, or a starport to different planets. GOOD LUCK walking 10,000 meters away from town for an 800 credit mission. Doing so will require you to use auto-run, thank god that was implemented. (For any players reading this review, it is the numlock key). I was able to watch the first quarter of The Screensavers on Tech TV and still have a few minutes before I got to my destination. The best players will be the ones with nothing else better to do than sit around holding the forward key, or watching your stupid character traverse across the world. Fun fun fun. All of this for a rediculous price of 15 dollars a month. I can easily have more fun playing Disney's new ToonTown MMORPG, which costs 4 bucks a month. Yay. I can even include a subscription to planetside - a critically acclaimed MMORPG - to still have a lower cost than ONE account to SWG. And I would probably have more fun playing these games as well. To conclude, the game was fun while it lasted. Now I am selling my perfectly conditioned game back to the store for 1/4 of the original price and moarning over the loss of 30 dollars, which I could have spent in much better ways. This is the last of my money Sony Online Entertainment is getting from me.	-1
This review will be short and sweet: save your money. Here's why... As with the (disappointing) post-Verant International expansions to Sony's popular "EverQuest" franchise, "Star Wars: Galaxies" is very short on content, but very high on greed-driven programming choices. For one thing, forget about making multiple characters on the same account... a courtesy which nearly every previous "MMORPG game" ever created has featured. In "Star Wars: Galaxies," you are forcibly limited to *one* and "only one* character per paid account, period. If you play for 3 months, and discover that you hate that character, you must start all over again from scratch (and will have wasted your previous subscription fees, naturally). Unlike every other game which has preceded it, "Galaxies" does not allow you to try out different characters simultaneously until you settle upon the one which you like best. The only possible reason for such an imposed limitation is a simple one: GREED. Sony wants your subscription fees, and this is an obvious ploy to milk as much money from their subscribers as possible. I could accept this a bit better if the game content warranted it, but it does not (the game world is entirely too small and bland overall). Additionally, when greed such as this so rudely limits the gameplay options, combined with the typically poor to nonexistant customer support (already made famous by Sony's infamous "EverQuest" experience)... well, such lack of concern for the gamer *frequently* becomes invasive to the gameplay experience itself. And that's simply not very much fun, unless you enjoy roleplaying a sucker lining the pockets of grinning Japanese businessmen... um, no thanks. "Star Wars: Galaxies" has (thus far) managed to disappoint nearly everyone who has courageously given it a try. Unless you are SERIOUSLY hung up on the "Star Wars" films, and simply can *not live* unless you get to be a Han Solo clone in an extremely limited gameplay world, I would recommend passing on this one. Save your money for a more promising game (such as the upcoming "Worlds of Warcraft" for example). Another big thumbs down. EDITING ADDITION: Back when I wrote this review in August, I was still waiting for Sony to patch and fix the immense number of bugs in SWG. I assumed (based upon Sony's infamous prior history of exploiting their customers and forcing us all to PAY to be Sony's beta testers) that SOE would eventually make the necessary repairs that this game required. After all, the game had only been released fairly recently when I wrote this review. Well, here I am still waiting for those fixes, and it is now October of 2003. Have they finally properly patched and fixed the unbelievable plethora of bugs in Star Wars Galaxies..? They have not. What's worse... when you complain to them, they become condescending towards you, their paying customer, and attempt to make you feel as if you "simply do not get it." Oh, I get it alright: SWG, just like most other Sony games, is simply a "get-rich-quick-before-they-catch-on-to-us-and-cancel" scheme. The various patches applied to this game have made the problems worse, not better. Classes have been nerfed to the point of being nearly un-playable, no one wants to play medics because they are generally unrewarding, hospital-type areas where players MUST go to heal up after battles are overcrowded due to lack of services, and generally, everything in this game seems geared toward making you wait days or weeks before you enjoy even a tiny amount of meaningful "progress." Days or weeks that you continue to pay for, whilst getting little to no satisfaction from either the game itself, or Sony's nearly non-existant customer support. My advice..? I hate to say it, but at this point I favour a MASSIVE and TOTAL BOYCOTT of ALL products from Sony Online Entertainment. Since greed is apparently the sole motivation they have behind their various decisions and practises... then fine: hit them where they apparently live. Hit them in their wallets. I just did... I cancelled every subscription I had to ALL the Sony Online Entertainment games I had been playing, including EverQuest (after nearly 4 years)... another game SOE has managed to nearly destroy after buying the franchise from Verant International.	-1
This game is just plain dumb. There are way too many glitches with animations and character movements. I find myself walking right through some objects. Don't buy it now, wait until some of these horrible bugs are cleared up. Wait until the Jedi fiasco is figured out, too.	-1
You thought this would be better than everquest, playing a wookie on different planets, tons of nerding for sure. Unfortunately it is nothing BUT everquest. Sure it is addicting but the design is fundamentally weak and the graphics are brilliant but only because it is funded well. It's pretty much mmorpg back to the basics, don't get this game whatever you do	-1
Galaxies is not worth buying at this time. The problem with the game is not the bugs. It's not the graphics. It's not the interface. It's that there is not enough to do. There's a limited amount of professions available, and to keep yourself interested, you have to be a hybrid of professions. Being an entertainer just isn't fun. Being a marksman or a brawler isn't either. It seems that you have to be a combination of a classes to stay entertained, and then it becomes a hassle trying to earn money or find people who can train you so that you can spend even more time hunting repetitive enemies, dancing in a catina, or scrounging for resources. I can't immerse myself in this game. Some people can. Some people are entertained just by chatting in the catina or chilling out with friends while picking off some enemies. I wasn't. There is no direction in this game. While some people might enjoy this, there still is no feeling of a goal, no feeling of accomplishment in anything that you do. You can join the imperial or rebel forces and do missions for them, but that feels isolated and insignificant. The whole world feels lifeless at the moment. In other online RPGs, there's always something to strive for, even if it's just leveling up to get that next item or skill. In Galaxies, there is no leveling, and there's nothing else that can compete with that feeling of accomplishment (however slight) that is present in combat oriented RPGs. Simply put, this game is not fun. (For me, obviously). Give it a try if you want, just be cautious and know what you're 50 dollars is getting you.	-1
The bottom line here: I've been playing this game for just over three weeks here, and it's the buggiest piece of computer software I've used in probably ten years. It's fun when it works. But almost every system in the game is, somehow, broken. Missions don't work (in several ways). XP awards don't work (once again, in several ways). Badges, a feature mentioned in the manual, don't seem to exist. Items disappear from inventory and from bank accounts. Player corpses disappear. Monsters and players suffer frequent rubberbanding. Framerates in the cities can be horrendously low (think 1 frame per several seconds). Frequent crashes to desktop. Frequent "Connection to SWG Lost" messages. And it's actually getting _more_ difficult to connect to the game in the first place. *sigh* Don't make the mistake I did and pay to beta-test this game. Wait a few months. When they've had time to finish it, I think it'll be great. Until then, it's just frustrating, frustrating, frustrating.	-1
You are paying for a product that is incomplete.  The only thing Star Wars about this game is the name of the planets.  I have been playing the *game* since launch and have yet to see any intresting depth or dynamic.  It tries to force players to roleplay and communicate by having insane amounts of downtown.  Normally though most people just go AFK during that downtime hoping someone will heal them.  The only intresting thing in the game is the crafting system but teh player driven economy means you will be spending all your time getting your own resources as there is no commodity market. The game does have promise, but I have played enough MMOs to know that 80% of the promises that companies make is a lie.  Look at Anarchy Online, Everquest, and so on... They keep stringing you along, getting that monthly fee while they finsih the game as you test it for them.  Maybe in a year with something other than boring missions and inane level grind SWG might be fun to play and hang out in... as for now, steer clear.	-1
Ummm... no thanks. I don't care HOW pretty it is, I, as well as just about every EQ player I know (and I know many of them) all agree: The timesinks stop at EQ1. There will be no starting over for any reason. We've all invested too much time on EQ1 to just drop it and move forward, especially with Sony's infamously horrific customer service. I am a paying beta tester for Everquest (in my opinion that game still hasn't left beta, and since I pay to play it, well, that makes me a paid beta tester doesn't it hehe). I will not pay Sony for the privaledge of testing their new game. IF Sony was smart, they would make Everquest II a complete rewrite of EQ1 with this fabled new engine of theirs and allow people to import the characters into it that they have worked so incredibly hard on. EQ2 is going to be a total loser, mark my words--regardless of it's prettiness or features. It will be another Anarchy Online, UO2 (ummm WHAT UO2? heh), Dark Ages of Camelot, etc. It simply will never reach critical mass because EQ1 players will NOT switch in droves like they are hoping. Sony is crazy to make EQ2 incompatible with EQ1. Not smart at all. It truly seems that the "soul" of Verant has left the building, in a big way, since their acquisition.	-1
I played this game already and can say that it doesn't live up to the hype.  Don't expect anything new, or anything that even meets the new standards of gaming.  This game is like every other game on the market but dressed up as Star Wars for marketing purposes.  It's really boring, the textures aren't impressive at all and the characters are shallow.  Playing this game is comparable to being beaten by an old lady.	-1
When EQ2 came out I screamed horray!!!! But as I played it I felt let down, betrayed, scammed, etc. I switch over to WOW and I am having a good time, but graphics are toonish though.  Do not waste your money!	-1
Given all the hype around this game, I had expected something phenomenal. The reality is that this is a VERY high-priced, but hom-hum, and 2nd rate effort by Sony.  Other reviewers have pretty effectively (and appropriately) flamed this title, so I'll make it quick...  Pros...  1) Excellent graphics, but nothing you haven't seen before  2) Simple UI; average gamer can be up and running in minutes  3) Huge gamespace with rich and varied character types  Cons...  1) Resource requirements are extreme (I have a system that runs Doom 3 well, but it gets severely bogged down on EQ2)  2) Lack of system availability (several hours a day, even worse on weekends) is maddening, especially given the hefty monthly recurring charge of $14.95  3) To get a character to a level where you can actually have fun requires the completion of literally dozens of stupid, poorly thought out tasks/quests (others have likened it to delivering pizzas -- IMHO, that's a pretty accurate assessment)  4) Neverending barrage of sales messages from Sony trying to get users to buy into other options, but at $14.95 month for access, I would think Sony would be embarrassed to try to get users to pay any more for this lame title -- for any game this sad, improvements/enhancements should be free  Net/net: many other options out are out there for on-line gamers that are much more fun at a lower cost.  My recommendation is to save your money and steer clear EQ2.	-1
Everquest2 is a visually appealing game, however, looks cannot carry a game. Everquest2 suffers from horrible zone mangement. When moving within the city and in between towns, you have a 30-40 second zone transition phase. While this may seem like not a big deal at first, when you are running around doing quests you spend most of your time zoning. Its a very poor experience.  The quest system is also poorly done. The quest rewards are terrible, and keeping track of what you have to do, and where you have to go should really be overhauled. EQ2 includes a quest "wizard" that lets you select a quest, and it will show you your progress, however; there is no intuitiveness to it at all. You can have 40 quests at one time, and quest management is time consuming, and typically poor reward for the effort. On average you get 30cp (copper) per quest completed. That doesn't buy hardly anything in the game, and the inordinate amount of time it takes running around like an idiot just doesn't make it worth it.  The map system is also poorly done, there is automapping of dungeons, and outside the city zones, you have to explore every edge to see anything, and there is no notation of where you are; it shows your dot, but not the name of the region. HOrrible management.  Adventuring isn't actually all that bad. A unique system of combo techniques, and focus on team environments make adventuring enjoyable, and ultimately what drew me to purchase the game, but everything else just makes the game too poor to suffer through.  Some folks might like EQ2, its not a horrible game, but it isn't revolutionary, or show any real innovation. Overloaded zones (they spawn new zones on servers when it gets overloaded, so you can have 2 instances of Anatonica -- thats just not something you should see from an established MMO gaming company), inventory, quests, just make this game more work to play than enjoy.	-1
The most tedious, time consuming mess I've ever played.  EverCrack fans will love it.  I hate it.  The bad:  Huge zone load times, same poor net code as EQ1, terrible graphics, boring quests, spelling errors, bad NPC acting. The game frustrates and is tedious.  Your forced to use online resources to locate things.  The good:  Really great animations.  Nice interface.  Great sound.  Neat spell effects.  Recommendation:  Game is not for everyone, definitely not for me.  If you have huge holes in your social life, might as well fill it with EQ2 - that's what they made this game for.	-1
The general consensus amongst the MMORPG community would seem to be this: EverQuest II is yet another example of Sony's fanatical obsession with eye candy over content.  There's little to no "meat" here... in fact, Sony's own online websites can't seem to provide any sort of storyline behind EverQuest II, other than it being set 400 years or so from the time of the original EverQuest, the moon of Luclin blew up, and now the entire huge, sprawling world of Norrath has been reduced to two measly starting cities, on one continent...  ...sounds pretty cheesy to me. Wanna see another red flag..? The sheer size of the installation of this game positively SCREAMS that it's loaded with resource-sucking bells and whistles, which Sony is well-known for focusing on when their overall storyline and content are weak.  Most veteran EverQuest players have watched Sony Online Entertainment completely RUIN the original EverQuest, ever since late 2002 when Sony bought out Verant (the originators of that once-classic MMORPG game). Given what we've all seen from SOE over the past few years (the destruction of EverQuest, the absurdly pointless Star Wars Galaxies, horrible customer service, and insultingly shameless greed), I see absoultely no reason whatsoever to believe that EverQuest II will be anything short of an overpriced, inane memory hog of a "game" that will ultimately leave the player feeling unsatisfied and cheated.  ...	-1
like so many other people, i fell in love with everquest when it came out.  it was the first game to approach a complete virtual world in 3D with tens of thousands of other people interacting with each other in a fantasy setting.  however, i know that the great things about EQ, the real spark, came from the initial developers, all of whom have since left to join various other companies because of Sony.  In my 5 years playing EQ, i have only seen Sony make bad decision after bad decision, release 5 ( or is it now 7 .. 8??!!) money grubbing expansions and consistantly ignore their absurdly loyal customer base.  MMGs, even more than other games, require companies that pay attention and value their customer base, and also PLAY and LOVE these games themselves.  I can tell you without a doubt in my mind that EQII is going to be a disaster for Sony, and I hope it drives them into the ground.  Buy World of Warcraft instead.	-1
***Spoilers alert***  In one of those rare instances where you play someone other than a Jedi in a Star Wars game, Bounty Hunter provided a very interesting and highly entertaining thrill-ride through the underbowels of Star Wars planets.  Such levels as Coruscant take you from the roof tops of some of the middle-level buildings, to the lower levels where shady nightclubs and such are.  Other levels take you to very interesting and highly lavishly built levels which provide a complex and interesting backstory as to how and why Count Dooku (pretending to be Syfo-Dias) chose Jango Fett to be the clone prototype for the Republic's clone army.  The gameplay is solid, and Jango is very powerful, and not invincible.  His weapons are easy to figure out, and fun to use, and his jetpack is very useful in almost any situation.  You have the ability to lock on to opponents with your guns, though this does not guarantee that all shots will hit, it certainly makes it easier when shooting and attempting to evade a flurry of blaster bolts hurled at you, and you not being a Jedi deflecting them with a lightsaber.  Unfortunately for a well crafted game, its biggest and ultimately fatal flaw is that it has absolutely no replayability.  It has a relatively short campaign of some 12 missions or so, and that is it.  There is no multiplayer, either online or with other controllers, there are no additions to the campaign or non-storyline battles you can do.  There is only the campaign, and once that is over, you are essentially done with the entire game.  Perhaps waiting a year would make it worth playing again, but otherwise this is not a game you should buy expecting too much.	-1
The first time I heard of this game I thought it was a must have. I thought it would be awesome to play as my favorite star wars character.  In fact, once I got a Gamecube, it was the first game I got. Here are the pros and cons of Star Wars: Bounty Hunter.  pros:  1-You get to play as the most feared Bounty Hunter in the galaxy.  2-You have all the weapons Jango has in the movies.  3-It has a good plot.  cons:  1-Levels are way to long and hard. Sometimes you don't even know what the heck you have to do to advance.  2-Graphics could use a little bit more work.  3-It's only one player. This game would be awesome if you could play cooperative.  I would suggest renting this game before actually buying it, to see if you like it or not.	-1
Really, be honest. This has got to be the WORST LucasArts game out there, besides the fact that they all are really horrible. The game has no real objective, besides get the bounty on an alien, while shooting five hundred others that look exactly alike. The gameplay is like a broken record. 1st, you scan an alien. 2nd you capture him dead or alive. 3rd repeat the process for 18 levels, while being blasted by dozens of other aliens that don't die until they have about fifty red hot laser beams in them. I really fooled myself buying this without renting it first...I wasted --- dollars on a game that isn't worth two. The long and the short of it? Do not buy this game, unless you like to be driven to the nearest padded room in a white coat...	-1
Bounty Hunter is a mediocre, glitchy shoot-em-up with one of the worst set of controls I've ever encountered on the GCN. I rented it for a weekend, and all I can say is that I'm glad I didn't waste my money. Word of warning to GCN owners: there is a cinematics glitch in this game. Three times I played through to the end of the second level, and two of those three times it froze up during the end-of-level cinematic. A friend also experienced this! Yet another reason why ports are a waste of money. The graphics are about what I'd expect from a multi-platform port, i.e. nothing special. Once I've played games like Resident Evil and Pikmin, I have to judge every GCN game to their standard of graphics, and BOUNTY HUNTER doesn't match; it looks like a very pretty PS2 game, at best, and the greatest thing that can be said is that it keeps the flavor of the STAR WARS universe well. The story is generic, though apparently at higher levels it ties into ATTACK OF THE CLONES. The levels weren't well designed. And character control is obnoxious--in order to complete all the tasks on a level, you must scan the bad guys for bounties, but getting your scanner on and working takes several seconds (it isn't a one-button task), and getting your guns back out takes several more, and by that time you're dead!	-1
I couldn't use it on my system	-1
old game. boring	-1
I tried reinstalling this some 10 years later to see how many people still play it and the sound for the guns didn't work with windows 7. I've uninstalled this and said its really time to move on.  Though if EA would remake this series I would buy that.	-1
In beta this game was great because it had PvP in it, but when there were a few weeks left of beta, they took out PvP. Yes the PvP system was super buggy in beta but instead of trying to fix it they became lazy and just took it out which was a very bad mistake. No PvP means a boring game once you reach the highest level cause there really is nothing left to do other than kill monsters, trade, and talk to other players which easily gets boring. If you have love for PvP like me then get Asheron's Call 2 or Dark Age of Camelot though those games aren't futuristic like this one, they have extremely good PvP. If you only want to play futuristic MMORPGs then wait for Star Wars Galaxies to come out. It's funny if how they just left PvP in this game then I would have rated it 5 stars, sadly they [messed] up because of their laziness. This is all I had to say.	-1
I beta tested, I played, I tested some more, spoke out on the message boards along with 100's of others saying it was not ready. Then to keep my FF account bought the game. They tweaked, messed with and took away, yet I stayed. Now months down the line I have not played in weeks and it does nothing more then add to the endless amount of [junk] that comes out of EA as of late. The idea to the game, the thought of the game and what the game is are very different. If you enjoy grouping, if you like to be FORCED into having to play with others then you have yourself something you might get into. Solo play is really not what this game is about, so it does take away from the "RPG" side of it. The lag is VERY bad. I ran off cable and DSL, both systems with different rates of speed still can not handle the lag that the servers are under. Persona and ship creation are good, but the bugs, the camping and the other mindless problems with this game, which should have been released months later then what it was put this game into the discount bin. Don't pay to play this junk. Other games are comming out that will hopefully add to what this game SHOULD have been. Check out E&B message boards, look for yourself at what people talk about before you buy this.	-1
this game is terrible. if your going to play this game you NEED to have a VERY powerful computer with incredibly fast internet. because there is no single player. or at least you don't want to play it because it is about as entertaining as CSPAN. the bots are worse than any game ive ever seen even the old 8 bit games has FAR better bots that could actually do damage to you. you can literally walk behind a bot forever and they will not see you. you can stand in a room of them and they will not even moove.but yet you can get sniped all the way across the map by a RPG or pistol by a bot. the multiplay is also very bad. the servers are run by 43 year old unemployed loosers that try to make themselves feel better about themselves by banning everyone who won't sercumb to their insults. BTW you cannot get unbanned and there are only about 3 servers that have more than 5 people playing in them. for the sake of money and having a JOB do not get this game. get a NES and have a game that will be WAAYYY better thatll last 30+ years.	-1
I have owned this game for a few years and thought i would pop it in and try it recently. I remember why i shelved it now. It is a waste of time. The graphics are ok for the age of the game and the general idea behind the game is decent. But the game fails to deliver.  Some things i see wrong with it and it is really a combination of  these that makes the single player boring:  1)aircraft are difficult to control and more effort than they are worth without a joystick.  2)Maps are unbalanced. Playing strictly as one side, they are either to easy or to hard. Some maps are hard to beat even on the easiest setting. And some  you don't even need to play to win even on the hardest setting.  3) Ticket point bleeding ( you can reduce your opponents tickets by holding so many control points without ever killing them) is stupid. What really does it for me is the stupid AI. IF you had a decent AI, it wouldnt be as bad.  4A) AI is terrible and unbalanced. Your side is stupid. Sometimes they stand around, they use bazookas on infantry, they can barely take a control point without your help and it takes them forever to it. Their accuracy is terrible. And one enemy will keep 1/2 dozen or more busy for over a minute. They are basically cannon fodder that steals all your vehicles and gets them blown up. Increasing cpu time to AI solves the problem to a degree but it also makes the enemy AI a lot more difficult so  it is still unbalanced.  4B) The enemy AIs are expert snipers.... with any weapon. I have been perched on a large hill sniping and got hit  from sniping distances with just about every enemy weapon but grenades. Even the enemy planes can pick me off on the first pass with guns. The enemy AI is amazingly accurate even at distance. They are also crafty.  They always know where you are and can always get behind you or sneak pass you and come up from behind and shoot you. They are much better organized and work together to take all the control points. IE: all of your own AI will run to the same control point where they will spend anywhere from a minute to several trying to take it. The enemy AI will  head to different control points in small groups and capture several in quick succession. They will also grenade  your armor in a group and take it out quickly. Whereas your own AI will not do this or manages to get killed before they even get close.  5)Scenerios play out to fast. Because of the constant ticket loss( bleeding) from one side or the other that almost always occurs games are short. You may only spend 25-50% of your time fighting. The rest of the time is spent getting to where the fight is and waiting on respawns. It doesnt really let you have a big effect on the outcome of the game. The biggest effect on the game is holding the right amount of control points to cause bleeding( or stop your own). You will spend alot of time running around trying to do this. And as soon as you leave the control point  It will be taken over by the enemy again. Which makes this a completely pointless task.  It would be much better without ticket bleeding. Then it would be based solely on kills to win( winning by attrition)  6) A combo of the above really kills the game. And really lowers the replay value. You will probably find single player to be more annoying than fun.  7) Bonus: EA even fails at cheats. The godmode cheat for this game reduces your tickets to about 1/4 of  your normal starting tickets.  Since your almost guaranteed to bleed tickets within the first 2-3 minutes it makes for a very short game. It is sad when they even make god mode boring. I always use cheats after i get bored with the normal game  to add some extra spice. EA really failed with this games cheat codes.  NOTE: Later Battlefield titles such as Vietnam had improved game mechanics. And some of the problems here don't exist in the later titles. I suggest skipping this title and moving to a later title if you really want to try the battlefield series.	-1
I haven't played this game but I've read the reviews from other gamers and I feel that this game is just a ploy to get the space war fans first before Star Wars Galaxies comes out, which from the reviews looks to be incredible and will definatly lay this game to waste.  SWG took the cake at the game show 1st place. I think anyone concidering buying this game should think twice and read the reviews for Star Wars Galaxies and compare them to this game reviews and see for yourself.  Save your pennies... its only around the corner.	-1
Battlefield 1942: Single player: * No gore. A disturbing trend in WW2 games: bloodless war. I guess we can't make our kids think war is cool and send them off to Iraq if we let them see war as hell. * Horrible enemy AI. Either the bots can't see you and you can shoot them in the back as they run past you, or they see you from so far away that they appear to be only a few pixels high right as they snipe your head off. It seems that the bots have a higher desire to get to the machine gun emplacements than to shoot a potential enemy. If you stand near some machine guns, bots will run past you to get to the guns, and then you can pop them in the head. * Horrible ally AI. They refuse to push forward. You end up doing all the work with moving your team towards the next control point, which means you get to die over and over from lack of support from your teammates. It also means you need to have a large number of bots set up to keep your control points defended. * No "reload" feedback. There is absolutely no feedback to tell you that you're out of ammo. No click. No nothing. Your weapon just doesn't fire. You also don't automatically reload when you're out, which might be slightly more realistic, but certainly doesn't increase the fun factor. You must keep your eye on the ammo counter at all times. * You can pick up different kits, but you can't pick up additional ammo for your current weapon. You have to get to an ammo box. * Domination type games only: The only type of game you can play is domination, where there are "control points" that each team must control to gain (or in this case, lose) points. There is no deathmatch, capture the flag, rabbit, assault, or any of the other game types that can be found in other multiplayer FPSs. * Battlefields only. There is no clearing buildings in BF1942. You will be fighting on an open battlefield in the outdoors. There are some simple buildings in Berlin and Stalingrad, but the AI refuses to use them. The enemy will always be outdoors. * Poor hit detection. I've fired several rounds into an enemy with a sniper rifle and I KNOW I've hit them, but hits aren't registered. Other times, it takes two shots to kill them, or one head shot. * Impossible to fly planes. Perhaps this is an acquired skill, but I can't get the planes to do anything for me. I end up flying off the map or crashing; I can't get anywhere near a target. The AI seems to use them well enough though. * Some boats seem to be impossible to exit if you're on them by yourself. Frustrating. * Disappointing Omaha Beach map. Not even close. After a while, you get used to these problems, and the game can be fun with the correct difficulty settings for your battles. It takes a lot of experimentation, but it really gets fun after you figure out how to set up the battle properly for the given map (and you don't expect much from the AI). The graphics are usually excellent, with some minor glitches here and there. * Multiplayer: Every time I try to play a multiplayer game I get an error message about receiving bad data. I can not join any internet servers. I suspect this is because I have the brand new 1.5 version and most other people haven't upgraded yet. I have yet to try BF1942 at the LAN. Overall. 2.5 stars. It's fun, but only after experiencing much frustration and disbelief at some of the poor choice in game design that were made. Requires you to learn how to set up the battle parameters correctly to extract enjoyment out of it.	-1
I played the demo before the game released and the framerate .... on my GeForce2. Then I finally picked it up because of all the hype and it still ..... UT2003, RTCW and Enemy Territory run super smooth on my system with the res to 1024x768. And from what I've seen they're more fun. And how can you have a WWII FPS with no blood? I don't know how this POS got game of the year. It's not all that. Pick up Wolfenstein or download enemy territory for the best WWII sim experience.	-1
The game designers did a good job creating a fun game, but a HUGE number of technical issues make this game overly fustrating.   My BIGGEST gripe is the copy protection.  In a BRILLIANT move that transfers the burden of piracy from the software company to the end user, EA uses a network key in addition to needing the original CD.  I can't tell you how infuriating it is to try to jump into a game only to be kicked off by the message "CD KEY IN USE".  Some pirate out there gets to play while I, who paid for the game, suffer the consequences.  Brilliant EA- just simply brilliant.   BF1942 (currently version 1.31) is full of bugs.  It will play for about 5 minutes and crash on me two or three times, with no error message, before I can get through a whole game.  One of the included maps crashes on me constantly- I have never been able to complete it.  EA tech support is not much help either.  They suggest running BF1942 from a clean boot without running anything else before.  This does help.  If I run another game, McAfee, Outlook, or Internet Explorer, before BF1942, BF1942 will crash constantly until I reboot.   The menu system is horrid.  The server browser has very little filtering, no favorites, and is locked to 640x480.  Some of the in-game player-player options are even worse.  If you want to add a player to your buddy list, you have to open a text console, type game.listPlayers, scroll to find the player ID number that matches your friend's name, then type game.addPlayerToBuddyList #.  Then, the the server loads a new map, you have to do the whole thing over again.  The voting interface is the same way.   When everything is working perfectly, it is a fun game, but you'll need a beefy CPU, GF4 or newer gfx card, broadband, and find a server with pleanty of bandwidth (It's fairly common to see players jumping around from lag).  BF is definately a resource hog.	-1
This game, is great. Probably the best game to ever hit the shelves, BUT, hope you have a killer PC with lots of RAM, good graphics card and memory. This game will be very jerky and laggy even on low settings. Everything else on it is good, the weapons and the vechiles are amazing. Just hope you have a VERY good pc.	-1
I was really looking forward to buying and playing Battlefield 1942.  I had heard so much hype about it.  You know what?  You need a super computer to play this game.  Now don't tell me to go buy a newer computer because I already have a new computer.  I have a Dell 1.7GHz with 256MB RAM and a 32MB Nvidia Geforce 4 Graphics Card.  No matter what setting I put this game on, this game lags and movement of everything is very slow. I ended up taking the game back to the store and putting in a preorder for the expansion pack to Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, which comes out next month. I never had any trouble at all with Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and it ran as smooth as silk on my computer.  Electronic Arts (EA) has published both Battlefield 1942 and Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and I can't believe they would let Battlefield 1942 be published with all of the bugs in it.  This game needs alot of work and alot of patches to be able to work right.  I'm very disappointed that EA released this game so early with so many bugs.	-1
The game is OK. Now your thinking i'm a retard since I gave it 2 and said it was OK. It is OK and the reason I gave it 2 was because it was slow with choppy graphics. Fun:B- Graphics: D+ Excitement: B Landscape: C Overall: D  I don't recomend it	-1
Duke Nukem Manhattan project is a 3D sidescroller and is the fourth Duke Nukem game. You as Duke Nukem must save the planet from the mutants and their cybrog leader. I played the game in the OpenGL video mode and it runs great, Direct3D is also available. It is the best looking sidescroller i have ever played, The graphics and sound are great. The single player is quite dissappointing, The game is not very long and it is mostly shoot everything that moves and the puzzles are just find the key card. There is nothing new between the levels and it is not a hard game, besides the boss in the seventh episode the rest of the game was easy. Duke Nukem Manhattan project is disappointing.	-1
So this is what we get after all these years of waiting? An updated version of Duke Nukem 2?   This game looks great, it has the same Duke Nukem attitude, but its watered down somewhat. The biggest problem with Manhattan Project is it's 3rd person side-scrolling view, just a terrible, backwards idea. It would have been really cool if this game used Raven's GHOUL II engine, as it stands you need a magnifying glass to see all the action in this game. The save game feature needs some work too, why do programmers want to restrict where and when I can save my game?? That is very annoying. And if you think you get a lot of weapons to play with, think again. Plus the strippers in the game don't strip like in the previous Duke Nukems, what a rip-off!!	-1
Seems they've fooled a few folks, but not me. They slap the name Duke Nukem on an old Mario Bros engine and expect it to hold it's own in the wake of games like SOF2, MoHAA, RTCW and GTA3!  Installed & tried the game, deleted from my HD, resealed the box and promptly returned it for a full cash refund- What a waste of time and effort- Weak pizza!	-1
This is the most dissapointing PC game I have bought in quite a while. I enjoyed the earlier Duke titles and thought they were great FPS games. The Manhatten Project retains some of the feel of the previous Duke games but is not up to par with its ancestors.  The biggest complaint I have is with the user interface.  It is nearly impossible to control the on-screen character with either keyboard commands or the joystick.  Also, the horizontal only movement and the third person perspective does not work well with a shoot-em-up such as this.  I like the graphics and the game concept but control is of paramount importance in a shooter and this game just does not have it.	-1
I'll be brief since this game is NOT worth wasting much time on. Short Version: If you have ever played any other football game on any other platform this one will probably disappoint. This is the worst football game ever (on any platform, going back to 1981) This is the worst XBOX game that I've seen. Graphics = D worst of any XBOX football game, even last years madden for the PC was much better.  Truely disappointing.  For example the goal posts don't look like poles, but a stack of poorly aligned Lego blocks (very bad jaggies) Sound = C+ so-so.  Nothing special, nothing horrible.  Very few choices and very redundent after 5 mins. Features = F Missing even simple things.  You can not review your roster, or set your starters.  There is no coach-mode, only arcade play.  Doesn't even pretend to be a sim. Supposedly you can import players from this game into Madden 2003, but what would be the point when the players in this game do not have any names?  And don't seem to be based on actual players? Gameplay = F VERY VERY VERY BAD.  Play last years NFL Fever 2002 for an example of how an arcade football game should play, or last years Madden 2002 for the PC for an example of how a strategy football game should play (or if you want, try an oldie called Front Page Sports FootBall Pro for even a better example of a strategy football sim).	-1
Don't believe me?  Take a stroll over to the NCAA 2003 message board at EA Sports' website and examine the multiple discussions over the XBox version both freezing and resulting in "disc dirty/damaged" errors during saving/loading. Coulda been a great game.  If not for a little thing called "quality control."	-1
I've always enjoyed Tomb Raider games. But I bought this game, and it did not work on my computer. My computer didn't match the maximum requirements (which they don't show you until AFTER you open the box), but it did match the minimum requirements. I didn't buy this from amazon.com, but I bought it from a different store. They had this stupid policy that you can't get a full refund if you opened it. How the heck are you supposed to know that it doesn't work, if you can't open it?!  Anyway, after a while, I got a PS2. So I decided to try it on PS2. It worked, but it's not that fun. It's almost impossible to control Laura. There are certain points in the game that you have to be at an exact angle to jump onto a ledge, and you can spend like a half hour trying to jump onto the stupid ledge. It's also not that fun because one of the "cool new features" is that she can only hold on for a certain amount of time. If you want to stay on a ledge for longer, you need to break a window, or kick a door down. Then she looses her strength again.	-1
I must admit, this is my first exposure to the Tomb Raider franchise. I know it is very popular and I was looking forward to it. Quite frankly, if things have been THIS bad all along, I'm not sure where the popularity comes from.  The scenery and graphics are pretty, and the camera GENERALLY does what it's supposed to. But the controls are absolutely terrible. There is no strafe (move left - move right) function; you can only turn and move either forward or backward, and there is no free-look. The mouse is practically useless. The control lag is UNBEARABLE. If you bring the character to a stop, it takes 2-3 seconds before you can get her moving again. Turning goes EVER so slowly. Jumping and maneuvering is SO bad that it's much more difficult just to get the character to move about than it is to play the game itself. Frustration ought to be in the task at hand IN THE GAME - not getting the controls to do what you want.  Even accounting for the fact that this game is 3 years old, compared to other games of THAT time, this game does not measure up in any way.  I realize that third-person games are difficult to do well, but this game is just plain bad. There are far too many games available - then and now, 1st and 3rd person, and of all different types - that combine great balance and control with great environments. As an avid gamer, I must strongly suggest against this game; don't waste your time or your money. Buy a pizza and get far more enjoyment out of it.  However, to be fair, I can't speak for the folks who are immersed in the Tomb Raider franchise. They may be inclined to look more forgivingly upon the atrociously bad controls and glitches in this game.	-1
Once again I have been duped into buying a game based upon the advice of so-called consumer reviews only to discover that the game fails to live up to the hyperbole. Lets be brutally honest, Praetorians is a game which is marketed to appeal to the Medieval Total war fans but delivers a product more akin to Age of Empires. If you are about seven years old and/or have a basically juvenile sense of wonder then surely this game was tailor made for you. With the exception of the even more awful Platoon PC game this has to rate as my biggest gaming disappointment to date. The pundits for this mediocre yawner glory over the fact that the game has no resource management thus freeing you up to do lots of scrapping. This is basically true but on the down side the maps are so badly designed that manouvering units in anything other than a gaggle is practically impossible. Units will often blunder into one another and become entangled, this is not conducive to a happy gaming experience and the battle has not even been joined yet. But this is pretty much the essence of the game. It (bottlenecked maps)force you into waging war between individual units rather than the grand battles of the ancient kingdoms which were set piece affairs on open ground. Units are created in villages/towns which sounds fine but once again we are dealing with an abstract depiction - a few huts and structures surrounded by a simplified pallisade and peopled by a few sprites which bustle about to simulate an occupation of sorts. Oh did I mention that this village/town is just slightly larger than a unit of infantry? Must have slipped every reviewer's mind I guess. Even creating units is a puzzlement. Just create a barracks and then instruct your leaders to train this or that and voila there they are-a couple of minutes later. Although some units require that your leader sacrifice honour points to create-Oh did I forget to mention that, must have slipped my mind....Honour is won in the slaying of enemies. In short there is an artificiality pervading the game which rather than enhancing gameplay reduces it to a farce. The Ai prefers to operate with a mob mentality - so much easier than trying to reproduce the model of efficiency and co-ordination which was the Roman Legionary system. Unlike the Total War series which relies upon maps with realistic terrain, Praetorians has opted for an even more simplified version of Age of Empires (the original one at that). Even the camera view is severely limiting because you can only see in line of sight which is not very far in this abstract representation of the real world. The map is revealed - not blacked out- thank heaven for small mercies. Pulling the camera back to take in anything more than a top down view of a small area is impossible-pretty much like playing the game. This even extends to the lack of ability to angle the camera - something I haven't seen in a game like this since I don't know when. PC gamers deserve so much more than a retro update on a much worn out formula given the relative expense of a new purchase - $40 or more for most, including this one. In mere value for the dollar I would be hard pressed to say that at half the price I paid for it ($20) that it is a worthwhile purchase. I could go on but just move along folks - nothing to see here....	-1
My Tomb Raider game is filled with bugs! Within 10 minutes of downloading it, I had to restart my computer 3 times! When the game does show up, I get a blank screen. I can hear the sounds and all but there are no pictures! Whatever I do I cannot get it to work. I've tried so many websites for help! I've waited a year for this and now I wish I didn't get it. Maybe it's just my game? But other people have been having the same problems too. Well, at least the box is cool. |=(	-1
This review is mostly for those of you (like me) that don't have a gamepad for your computer. Using the keyboard for this game is just plain awful. I rated this a 2 because the graphics are solid, the sound effects are good, the music is rockin, and the tutorials that help you learn the game from intercepting passes to kicking are great. But the gameplaying is not. Trying to use a keyboard for this game is not a good idea. You can reconfigure the keys, but there are so many different buttons to use that I can not come up with a good solution other than to buy a gravis gamepad. The other thing that is annoying was that on defense, even if I am playing with 8 guys in coverage, the other team always seems to have a wide open receiver. I have never had a wide open reciever yet even when I have 5 guys in pattern and they are playing a run defense. Every receiver seems to be double covered no matter which one I throw too. And there never seems to be running room either. It might just be the control issue which hopefully will be taken care of when my Gravispad comes. If so, I will write another review then. But for right now, I am not impressed with the gameplay.	-1
I love military shooter games.  I have all the Ghost Recon's that are available on the PS2 and I have finished them all with minimal frustration.  SOCOM has the same kind of formula with a squad based tactical shooter.  You're in control of two teams of two SEALs going after terrorists in different environments:  open ocean, snowy mountains, jungles, deserts, and caves.  It all sounds great, but I can't find that much enjoyment out of this game.  I had heard good things about this series so when I found a used copy for a good price I picked it up.  It took a while to get used to the weird controls by hitting up on the d-pad to get into night vision mode.  And switching to grenades in the middle of battle is clunky as well.  I always got a bit too into it and ending up switching my primary weapon to 'nades instead of switching back to my assualt rifle and ending up dying.  I had to give up using anything but the preset weapons in the missions.  The frustrations go on ... your lovely AI teammates will be facing you when a terrorist comes behind them they do nothing and you get shot at.  As soon as you shoot they stand up and get shot in the face, or do nothing and watch you die.  So much for the SEAL code.  Another big frustration is you can't shoot enemies when they are next to a wall for cover, but they can sure hit you if you're doing the same thing.  If you go prone your cross-hairs will be dead on with a terrorist's head for the kill but your rifle is stuck pointing up.  All that does it get you killed.  There are 12 levels in the game and when you find the way to beat each one you can do it in about 10 mins or less no problem.  Finding the best way to complete the missions is another story.  One time you're perfect and you team is still at full health and you get to the last part of the mission and die.  You start over knowing exactly what to do and where to send you team.  Then you team will screw it up and get you, or themselves shot.  Very inconsistant game and it drives me nuts. I realize its a tactical and strategic shooter, but its also a game.  The right idea was there, but just can't handle the frustrations with it.  Maybe this isn't the type of shooter I should be playing.  I enjoy the Ghost Recons, Killzone, Project: Snowblind, Cold Winter, Medal of Honor series, and Area 51.  SOCOM just annoys me.  You might enjoy this game, and if you do thats great.  If you're like me and get frustrated by repeating levels over and over and over then find some other series to try out.  Hopefully the later games in the series fix some of these issues, but I seriously doubt I will ever find out for myself.	-1
i'm a big fan of military and FPS (well this one is 3rd person, anyway) games. this is the worst squad game i've ever played. your teammates do not react as a real human would: they stand and try to shoot ennemies in plain sight, a group of ennemies appear and your teammates do not even go to find a spot to hide, way too many bugs, your teammates shoot but they do not dudge ennemies bullets (what is that wall next to u for?!). an enemy throws a grenade and your teammate do not even jump out from the area or throw back the grenade to the enemy, etc. they might walk like commandos/spec ops, shoot precisely like commandos/spec ops, but they do not respond at all like commandos/spec ops: i approach an entrance and these guys do not even get to hide on both side before the entrance nor a guy is watching my back. i go inside a building, these guys do not even follow me in line. u call that teamwork? this game is only good in multiplayer. not even worth a star. not even worth to buy. go for Star Wars Republic commando. now that's what i call a squad that respond according to the situation with real military procedures.	-1
Multi platform games [arent' good] and this is just another example of the same thing for the last 5 years of madden.  Graphics are ok but not breathtaking.  It seems the only thing that sells this game anymore is the name personally I think everyone should take a stand and quit buying this cookie cutter game.  Let someone else show what they can do for a while like sega.	-1
First of all, Blitz 20-03 is a really awesome game...for about an hour.  Blitz is an Arcade game, so there is crazy things (late hits, no penalty, 30 yard for 1st down) going all over the place.  It sounds really good, but after a while, things get really old, and you will get bored of it really fast!  The graphics stayed true to the arcade, and control's perfect.  There is no depth to this game, so i suggest try either NFL 2k3, or Madden 2k3.  Only get Blitz 20-03 if you haven't gotten tired of previous Blitz's.	-1
I have had this game for a couple years,it's fun to play,I have always been interested in submarines. My only complaint is I am unable to save my game progress,I always have to start from the beginning,once I got to a poiny where there was some type pf fortress with some huge cannon,and could progress no farther.  There is absolutely no support for this game,so if you have problems like unable to save games,you can do what I did,uninstall the game and toss it in the garbage,thats where my Steel Tide ended up after 2 years.  All that effort wasted gets old after a while.	-1
EVEN ON EASY THIS GAME IS WAY TOO HARD! Every pass I throw gets intercepted, and every rushing play becomes a loss.  This game is a reason to get anger management classes!  I have never played a more frustrating game in my life.  Plus, Midway treats football like a pro-wrestling match.  It is extremely annoying to have that factored in to an already horrible game.  If you want a good football game, get Madden 2003.  This game is just horrible.	-1
I played NFL 2K2 before but I gave Madden a chance with the 2003 rosters. Madden has more features like old school teams, practice, drills, card trades, etc but if you just want to play with your buddies on or offline nothing beats the tackles and hustles of Sega NFL 2K series. The tackling is hard in Madden, there's no slamming or effect on the tackle. It's plain. I still can't figure out the audible. In Sega NFL 2K, you just press a button to call an audible and a list of optional plays will be displayed for you to choose. In Madden, nothing appears I guess you are expected to know the sequence of play from the controller buttons. This is the last time I'm buying Madden.	-1
didnt work	-1
Does not work in windows 98.  Get black screen.  Have to do hard reboot.  Tried proactively configuring ZoneAlarm to allow internet access, but that did not help.  Remove Infogrames from list of acceptable software distributors.  I mean, if their software does not work in windows 98, then what kind of quality control do they have? Obviously none at all.	-1
Can't get this program to work with Windows XP at all. Screen goes black and locks up the computer. Atari does not offer any kind of patch to fix their program, but suggests you open Windows Task Manager and start shutting down all the background program on your computer to eliminate conflicts. Sorry, but I'm not shutting down my anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall programs to play a stupid video game!	-1
After many re-installations, I have given up on this game.  It keeps crashing my six-month old computer running XP.  After I installed a new hard drive after my old one got corrupted due to a virus, I reinstalled Scrabble to see if it would work again.  The game loaded up okay, but when I went to play it against Maven the computer player, the game was on auto-pilot!  I had no control over what words I could make on my turn -- the computer program was doing everything!!  Obviously, there are some serious bugs in this game.  I am very disappointed that once again I blew $20 on a game I cannot play.  There are no patches on the company's website, either.	-1
I love the Sly Cooper Series, but I must say, this is my least favorite. The graphics are poor and getting keys get boring after a while. The most fun part is the driving games with the Cooper Getaway Van. Can't wait for Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time!	-1
Sly Cooper & the Thievious Raccoonus is a dumb game. The grafics are like a cartoon which is kind of cool but after a while it gets annoying. The game is hard too. I couldn't get past the 3 level. Dont get the game.	-1
I spent about 10 minutes playing this game before I realized what a bad game it is. I love the cell shading, and I wish PS2 would have more games, better games that is, with art like this one. However, I found this game to be far too simplistic to be enjoyable. You don't get a health meter. AT ALL! If you touch ANYTHING you're not supposed to (for me, it was a plant) you die instantly and are sent back to the beginning. If you fall into the water you die instantly. If you die three times you start all over, like you did in old Nintendo games.  True, I didn't get past the first level so I don't know if this situation improves at all, but for a game to have that kind of set up in the first place is pointless. Hasn't gaming come far enough in the past 20 years that have rendered the concept of "how many lives I do I have left?" totally useless? My suggestion: Rent it and see for yourself.	-1
In my opinion, Sly Cooper is the best platform next to Mario but don't get too excited because it's still a platform.  Sly Cooper looks great and makes good use of the cel shaded graphics.  That's probably the best part of the game.  The game can be more looked at as a platform on a rail or a combination of 2D and 3D.  If you have played Crash Bandicoot, you get the idea.  In fact, Sly Cooper probably uses an upgraded version of the crash Bandicoot engine.  The gameplay has a lot of new additions but for anyone who has played Crash Bandicoot the gameplay will seem very familiar at some points. The game has five different worlds, each is introduced as an entirely 3D environment, but that's just deceiving. Your real goal is to find the doors in which you will enter a mission and be forced to complete a linear 2D/3D railed obstacle course.  It's a little more creative than Crash Bandicoot where you literally where in a portal room and each of the missions had a door with a label on it.  The Objective of each world is to gather all the keys that lay in that world.  You collect the keys by passing the linear obstacle courses obviously.  Once you have collected all the keys of that world, you can now use them to gain access to the boss of that world.  Then you beat the boss and move on the next world.  Think Crash Bandicoot again, only you actually see yourself inside of a van, and you see your progress on a map in a cartoon like cut scene, this indicates your in the process of traveling to the new world.  In Crash Bandicoot, the portal room just moved up to a new floor with all new missions again. The game has awesome graphics, and very good dialog.  The cut scenes are literally cartoon quality.  At times, you will feel like your actually playing a cartoon.  The game has a story line, it's a rather weak one, but I thought it was surprisenly mature.  The story starts off by Sly Cooper giving you a history briefing about how his whole family was killed by some thugs the night his families jewel, "The Thievious Raccoonus" was stolen.  Since then, he's been on a mission to get it back.  I don't remember the last time anyone was killed in the story line of a Mario game.	-1
I have this game and only beat Castlevania 2.  It is not worth playing because there is nothing to unlock.  So don't buy it unless you like bad unmodern graphics.	-1
To start it off, don't buy it, heck, don't even rent it. The graphics are horrible for what a Gamecube can crank out. And all of these different grooves to fight in, whats with that? Also, the gameplay gets really repedative. All of the characters look [strange] and there moves stink! If I could I would give it a negative 5 stars. If you want a good game get Def Jam Vendetta, it even has 4 player action. But, don't waste your money on this load of [fluff].	-1
In this day and age I assumed all vidio games, exspecially a game like jeopardy or wheel of fortune would have online multiplayer capabilities so you could play with friends online.  I was wrong.. that would have made this game a 5 star to me. ...	-1
Hitman seemed like it was going to be lots of fun until It took me 6 hours out of one day just to try to attempt to beat the first mission. I got it this morning and will be trading it in tomorrow. Just for the record I still have not assassinated the Don in the first mission. This game will frustrate you to the point of migraine and that's not something I'd like to endure in my leisure time. I thought video games were supposed to be fun with a bit of a challenge, not this one though, this is all challenge no fun. Dont But it unless you want a headache.	-1
When Need for Speed Hot Persuit 2 failed to deliver, I turned toward the X-Box Sega GT 2002. After 2 straight hours of playing this game in the store I was hooked.  However, when I bought the X-Box and came home with the game, I found that after many more hours of play, the game can become very, very frustrating. Once inside career mode you can buy a cheap car and upgrade it for a slight performance difference. Once you've won a few races you can buy other cars or maybe you want to play in the Official Races.  The Official Races were a complete mistery to me and after getting my B Licence, I wish I would have never played them. All the Licence's seem to do is make the difficulty go up as well as the cash for winning a race. However, the rate at which difficulty goes up is not matched by the money. By the time you hit B Licence, you'll find the CPU Car's shooting way ahead of you from the beginning of the race and cornering at speeds you'd never be able to, even though they may have the same car as you with the same spec's. This is a very cheap way of making the game harder. The worst part about it is once you gain licences, your screwed and can't go back to old licences (difficulties) unless you start over.  One thing that you learn early in this game is that research doesn't help much. After researching the best car to buy out of all the cars available for $27,000-30,000 price range, I found that the Camero was the best buy. Sure enough it ran well in the races, about as well as any of the other cars. Oh and did you know, Damage is inexistant! No damage modeling in this game what so ever, atleast none that I can see. The only form of "damage" is a meter in the top right of the screen that says how much health the car has left before you hit "max damage". What max damage means, I have yet to find out, since you can race with max damage on just as well as you can with perfect health. Also physics are pretty nill when it comes to bumping around with other cars. Bumping against another car will make your health go down just as fast as if you plow straight into a wall. Yet the car still appears to be untouched. In short I was ready to chuck my new X-Box out the window the day after I bought it because of this game. However, if you are able to look past these problems, you will find beautiful graphics and a fair sound track. The game interface is only mediocre. Yet I pledge my word that on the [money] I spent on this system, I will attempt to see only the good side of this game, in which case this game is a small piece of heaven, very very small.

I was looking forward to this game so bad that it was all I could think about for days before it came out. Well, I was greatly dissapointed! The graphics are BLAH at best. The game play is choppy and bumpy. The XBox processor can do much better than this. When are game designers going to utalize the XBox's true potential? This game looks like junk and is NOT fun...this makes me sad. I really wanted to like it. RENT IT FIRST!	-1
Will try to avoid repeating what's already been said, but "Hitman 2" mostly hits the right marks, but there are numerous times when it feels more like a chore or task than a video game when slogging through the levels -- it lacks the tension that exists in such stealth games as Tenchu or Metal Gear Solid. An overarching reason for the lack of tension (aside from the levels themselves) is the main story line: the various levels have little to no connection to 47's main goal: to find his padre. Why travel all over the world performing numerous missions, when his main mission should be just trying to find his religious father? As the amazon.com review states, the enemies' AI, at times, is seemingly non-existent (you can walk beneath ninjas up in the rafters, without them even turning a head to look down at you as you walk on by.) And the game gives more than enough saves to easily make it through levels. Some levels are a study in frustration, where you spend a lot of time, running from one location to another, sneaking in one place to yet another, and then maybe back again, only to commit a blunder (such as walking into a room, missing an enemy target, and then getting killed -- or getting hit by an unseen sniper far off in the distance) and then have the fun of doing it all over again. It's not a bad game, but playing it, you don't feel like you're part of the world 47 inhabits.	-1
Being a spy is one thing, but being a hitman is another. A hitman is not a good idea for a Video Game hero. The game looks like ... as well. You kill someone and you have to hide their body so no one sees it. What about that huge blood mess you made on the ground. Oh well if anyone sees it they'll just think someone spilled their fruit punch all over the ground and forgot to wipe it up. What a stupid game. Give me a break.	-1
The game has great potential but it just falls short. Great physics, well-detail classic cars and decent graphics weren't enough to save this release. My main problems are, firstly, that the tracks seemed to be created at random . . . meaning that they just didn't make any sense; placing corners here and there just for the sake of having turns. Whoever created this title probably hasn't ever seen an actual track. Even as something as simple as a racing oval was screwed up by having the pitting area on the backside instead of the front straightaway (a moot point, however, as there is no pitting in this game. On top of that, there are only eight tracks or so and all of them quite short. Second, the game can be finished within a day or so. There is about twenty events, but you seem to be doing the same ones over and over again to make enough money to buy different cars. All of them which need to be upgraded to even have a chance at winning. As I said, not terrible. But when one becomes used to benchmark titles such as Gran Turismo 3, Project Gotham Racing and Rallisport Challenge it's hard to accept a seemingly casual effort like this one.	-1
Every year around Thanksgiving, I always get several new games for PS2. I've had faith in my magazine I subscribe to, and have managed so well in the past at getting awesome games that my bros seem to depend on me to make a good decision.  This year, I went out on the limb to buy Hitman 2, which I thought would surely make a great game as every review I've seen has been almost perfect. For the first year in my 'fantabulous game' streak, I got a terrible game. When you start out in Hitman, you get a basic (if not overly simple) tutorial on how to play the game.  It's enough to get you hyped up to play the game, but that's about as fun as the game gets. Although the game does have a unique story line, an interesting concept, and a nice list of weapons, it fails to deliver a quick paced, get in - get out feel that you'd imagine a hitman would have. The game depends far too much on the player's patience. For example, once you start in on your first mission, you feel like you can take on the world - like the perfect hitman. So, you listen to what the game all but tells you, and kill and assume the role of a helpless postman. Fair enough. But as soon as you walk to the gate and get searched by the guards, you get gunned down after they discover your sidearms. Okay...so this time you try again by leaving your weapons outside. Again, you're gunned down for letting a guard see you try to enter a room beyond the front door. Am I the only one that finds that ridiculous? After replaying the mission to death, I decided to run in guns blazing and managed to beat the first mission. Beyond just requiring your patience, the game seems to ask the impossible at times. For another example, some missions require you to find your sniper rifle and then head to a designated sniping point to make a shot. Sounds easy enough, but just getting to the location is a feat in itself. If guards see you with the rifle, they start blazing. If you try to assume the role of a guard and then try to carry a sniper rifle, they still start blazing upon seeing you. Why does it have to be this hard? Even just walking from place to place is annoying. If you run, guards will get suspicious and, you guessed it, shoot you. But if you try to walk to where you need to be, it could take hours to play one mission. The 'sneak mode' that you can enter by pressing L1 may help you to take out one guard, but you move so slow that either he'll eventually turn around and see you, or his friends will come to his aid. All this is on the EASIEST setting. Wow. I have to say I've never played a game quite this bad. The only thing this game is good for is helping you realize that life is short and you need to get off your butt and get outside.	-1
No one want to play it so hare to review a game they won't play . Just not there stile I guess .	-1
Crash died years ago.  The original should have been the first and only.  Sony even realised these games were garbage, and sold the liscence to Konami so they could produce this game on Xbox and GameCube and let them suffer low sales.  Good idea on Sony's part.  If you still want to get this game, bang your head on the wall and stop thinking about it.  You'll one day thank me.	-1
Waste of money guys once it loads you can't play it at all plus it made my computer crash twice. So think about it before you throw your money away on a game you can't play.	-1
wouldn't play for me	-1
Its fun for kids, but it will not working on anything but old systems. We had an old beat up computer ancient and it worked on that. Forget it if you have a newer computer.	-1
Well, I played Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 and couldn't get enough of it. The game play in the Roller Coaster Tycoon series has a feel to it much like any simulation game in that you must try your best to keep some form of balance working in the place you are given. Building Coasters and then watching people ride them alone with trying to keep your park clean and full of other rides, attractions, and shops keeps you glued to the screen for hours. That being said, this game really is not much improvement on the first one. The graphics are now even more dated then ever. You cant get a very big close up on the people in the park and that makes things a bit more dull. Also, the only real improvements I can see is the new scenery (which doesnt make much difference in the park rating) and the fact that some of the rides are based on rides from Six Flags. One problem is that if your park has been designated as a pay-at-the-door park, you can not charge a dime for the rides, even if you want to. And as stated before, The graphics of the game play has not changed at all, which makes the game seem like more of an expansion pack to Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 then it does a new game. So in closing, While the game isn't that great, if you have twenty bucks to blow and are as addicted to the first one as I am, go ahead and get it. Otherwise, don't bother. I am curious to see if Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 (if they make one) will be more entertaining then this game.	-1
Nothing really new. The First one was better. Just new items thats it. The same sounds from the original. And yes if that freakin kid still whines from the first one. Wait for the 3rd version to come out! Save your money! The only thing cool is the new 6 flags rollercoasters. Gets old quickly	-1
If you've never played the Rollercoaster Tycoon series, than by all means, quickly buy the sequel because it's probably one of the most enjoyable games ever.  It has a simple concept behind it yet the game keeps you hooked for months.  If you love designing and creating, this IS the game for you as it's basically a layman's theme park builder.  For those that did play the first game, I have a small warning for you:  Unless you're hopelessly addicted to the first game and its many expansions, you probably won't get much out of the sequel.  It's almost a carbon copy of the first game.  Some of the rollercoaster building mechanics have changed, there are new attractions, and you can now play on maps that are realistic portrayals of the popular Six Flags theme park chain.  Other than that, everything is the same, even the graphics (which are usually the first thing to get updated in a sequel) don't look any different.  My recommendation for anyone that is the patient type and wishes to buy this game is to wait a month or two.  There are already two expansions for the sequel.  Games like these are quickly packaged into bargain combo packs and I imagine it won't be long before both expansions are available with the original game at a low price.	-1
Don't buy this game if you're looking for a totally updated version.  It's not.  Its really just an expansion pack -- a good one (unlike loopy landscapes and the other one which didn't really add much).  I really think that you shouldn't label a game part 2 unless you completely redo the interface, plot or some other MAJOR part of the game.  This was just some nice add ons and tweaking.	-1
Just a word of warning for anyone expecting a completely new game.  Before you pre-order this title, take a look at the screenshots for the new game.  You can find some on the company's website or any PC game review website.  The sequel looks EXACTLY like the original game.  They've altered the roller coaster design features a little and inserted a few different rides but overall, this game is almost a carbon copy of the first one.  If you enjoyed Corkscrew Follies and the other expansion game, this game is for you as all it really is is more maps and a few more rides but if you're expecting something different (which I always do with sequels) you're going to be horribly disappointed.  Even the graphics engine is still the same.  This game is primarily meant to cash in on one of the most popular game series ever.	-1
I just don't get it.  What do people love about this thing?  The game is borderline unplayable.  Melee fighting is like watching two puppets having a slap fight, glitches abound that make finishing some missions an exercise in futility, and you have to spend like 10 minutes driving to replay any mission. About the only thing I can say for it, the radio stations are really amusing.  Just go buy any other GTA title.	-1
I confess I didn't get very far on this game before I quit and put it up for sale, but I intensely dislike games where you have to go back to an area and finish it after you've acquired additional skills somewhere else. And the camera angles are really bad. It's difficult to position Scooby for jumps and you can't see some areas you think you need to. I went to the mansion, the playground, the fishing village, the vault, and some area that might have been a cemetery and apparently the sun never comes out in Scoobyland because each level was dark and dreary. After I earned a warp power, it turned out there was no place I could warp to. Very frustrating. And you don't have much directional control of Scooby when he's supposed to be swinging on something.	-1
I absolutely love vice city. One of my favorite games of all time. One huge problem.  I bought it BRAND NEW from here. It didn't work! It kept freezing after maybe 5 or 10 minutes of playing!  I don't know if it can be the console because all my other games work just fine. What a dissapointment!	-1
I'm a huge gta Fan and always wanted to own all the GTA games. I regret getting this one though, it's insanely boring. Just stick to San Andreas and GTA 4, or preorder GTA V.	-1
These people are going to far with the shooter games. They have enough already and there ending up to be exactly the same. Sure Eidos Interactive is a great maker for games but haven't they made enough shooters for xbox????	-1
I had heard a lot of great things about this game and was very tempted to buy it, but I decided to rent it first.  I was right, the game isn't that great.  The controls are ok, but the graphics are PS2 graphics.  Hitman 2 has a good concept, but the gameplay itself is very poor.  It's a first player perspective so if you're one to get dizzy playing first shooter games then this game is not for you.  If you're looking for a good game you'd be better off with Splinter Cell.  After playing Splinter Cell, no other games compare to it.	-1
The game is fun, yet its sick and twisted at the same time.  Its scary to think pulling some guy out of a car and beating him to death with a bat could be fun, or blowing off a hookers head with a combat shotgun.  I'm in my thirties so I know this crap is make believe.  I am not that sure some of these kids out there are that smart to understand that.  Kids now a days do some sick and twisted stuff, like go on killing sprees at school.  The game is fun to me but I totally think its warping the minds of our youth so I will only give it a 2 for an overall rating but a 5 for the fun factor.	-1
B-O-R-I-N-G. That pretty much says it all about this game. I've been trying to think of at least some redeeming qualities to this game for those who enjoy its premise, but sadly there are none. Sure you can design rooms and kitchens, bars, game rooms and meeting rooms, but that's about all there is to it. There's none of the snappy humor you get in other SIM games; and the customers are whiny about every detail from not buying THE most expensive sink in the public restrooms, to not being on THE most expensive chairs in the restaurant. Even the "challenge" levels are quite dull. It's definately not the game I was expecting. ...	-1
I'm a little late to the game because I just got my PS2 a year ago.  It is impossible to rate "Vice City" without comparing it to GTA 3.  GTA 3 was immediately engaging; the story was cool and the city was interesting enough to actually want to explore and look around for secret items, power-ups, etc. without having to resort to cheat codes for everyting.  I must have played GTA 3 for over 100 hours easily and it never got old.  So I now finally got around to playing "Vice City" and it was instantly disappointing.  Despite what other reviewers have said, I think the graphics in "Vice City" are horrible.  Everything is so ugly to look at, and the graphics are so choppy it almost hurts my eyes to look at it.  Besides lousy graphics, the city is really uninspired; there's nothing engaging or interesting about exploring "Vice City."  Almost right away I thought, well okay maybe cheat codes will help.  But even with codes, the game still sucks.  The physics are terrible as well; whenever you try to punch/attack a pedestrian, you'll find yourself flailing away almost aimlessly because the physics don't make any sense.  I don't know what else I can say about "Vice City," it just seems like a really bad mod of GTA 3 and I don't understand what all the hype is about.  Maybe San Andreas will be better since it took Rockstar two years to release instead of rushing to market with GTAVC.  If you must play this game, just rent it and don't waste your $20 (Yes, it was that bad).  Pros:  "Bigger, Louder, Blah, Blah, Blah"  Cons:  Graphics (Horrible)  Level/City design (Uninspired and Lame)  Physics (Very Poor)  Framerate (Choppiest game I've played on PS2)  I wouldn't play this game if it was free!	-1
the controls are horrible (especially the first person targeting), ugly graphics, missions are stupidly difficult (could be ok if not for the frustrating controls), and some of them have insane time limit. this game probably never went through quality control. cross-stitching is more fun than this stupid game!	-1
this gam is on of the mos violent games i have ever played and is not reccomended for chilred under 16. But i was 13 when i played this game at a freinds house and liked it for a while the weapons are great and it was a great way to relive stress. By going on a mass killing spree. But this game i not as much fun as one would think. But it it deserves the rating it recivied.	-1
Ok, I do admit when grand theft auto 3 came out for ps2 I thought it was the best game ever. But I mean after a while it gets really boring. The loading is slow in the beggining, the missions are ridiculosly hard. And the game has quite of a crapy story. I mean after a while of killing people and getting chased by cops...cmon. What ever happen to people getting addicted to classic games like Mario and Zelda. Now hip-hop has taken over the world. I mean the real fun thing is the radio because K-chat is fu**** funny. But after the chainsaws and boozucas, it gets boring. I'm glad that in the prequal they put mortocycles. But then the new prequal San An Dreas, which is taking place in the 70's, they should come out with games that take place in the present. I meant this ones cool and all because they tried to make it look like "Scarface", but cmon. In the prequal for the radio there better be some "Sex Pistols", "The Clash", "The Ramones" or at least the "Misfits". Don't but this game unless your an idiot.	-1
if ur a mk fan I would recommend this game but this game has to be one of the worst mk midway had ever made if u want a good mk game I would recommend mk Armageddon	-1
I bought this game really just to jump on the GTA bandwagon & see what all the fuss was about. Its way too hard for me. Unless your a "rocket scientist",I suggest you stay far away from this one.	-1
I have tried playing this game for the X-box with several different Grand Theft discs each time it gets locked up more often than a career criminal do not rent do not buy. It is more frustrating than it is worth.	-1
This game gets old fast. The graphics are ugly. The gameplay is bad. It all seems pointless and stupid. Not in any way fun. How could someone like this crap? What is it that they see in this game? There are so many better games out there. It goes out of its way to seem violent and wrong. The plot is so unbelievalbe in a bad way. It stereotypes big time.	-1
This game sucks Big Time!  I have played tons of RPG's, and I never put down a game unless it absolutely deserves it and this one certainly does.  As many stated already, the controls are horrible. You have to like push the up arrow key and then click the left mouse botton while trying to keep yourself in line with the enemie(s) to even stike a blow, and God forbid you have more than one enemy after you at a time.  The graphics, sound and realism is nice but what good is that if you cannot fight your enemies effectively.  Honestly, I think any game is better than this garbage dump.  Save your cash and pass on this one.	-1
Why, oh why are all the Mortal Kombat games THE SAME???  Ever since the first one, the games have repeated themselves over and over and over again.  This one is no different, with only a few new charachters and old ones that are supposed to be dead!  Kano was killed by Sonya in Trilogy, yet he's back.  Kung Lao was killed by Shao Kahn, but he's alive and kicking.  And Kenshi.... wherever the idea for him came from, it wasn't good.  How does that guy fight with blindfolds?  It's simply dumb.   One more thing about every last Mortal Kombat game: WHY IS NOVICE THE LEVEL SO HARD?  Sure, it starts out easy, but gets way too hard, climaxing on Moloch.  Moloch came out of nowhere, and he is a big cheapshot, repeating moves over and over, kicking your man while he's down, etc.  The game is impossible to win, making it pointless.   Another interesting thing is while it says that there is a new fighting engine, the only thing that is different is that there are 3 fighting styles, and while it isn't hard to switch styles, they are usually all the same.  Weapon mode is different, but very limited.   This is just another game in a series of games that are all the same.  Save your money and don't buy this clich.  The only different thing about this game is the way the charachters look.  What a joke.	-1
Warning: this game is not for kids!   Unreal 2 for the Xbox is a first person shooter (FPS) game. You play a space marine named John Dalton. You travel with your small crew of bounty hunters to different planets securing alien artifacts. The alien artifacts are believed to be parts of a super weapon. Everyone wants the weapon, including power hungry   aliens. Unreal 2 is very similar to the famous game "Halo", but it lacks the intensity and polish of, Halo. They even included some levels where you fight alongside space marines, but the A.I. is not very impressive. Everything in this game is just average. I felt bored in many of the levels because they required too much walking in an empty world and no action taking place. The voice acting is terrible. The actors sound like amatures reading the script.   Pros:   +good controls   +average graphics   +average sound effects   +lots of weapons   +long game   Cons:   -Halo rip-off   -long loading times   -no co-op gameplay   -too much walking   -severly scripted   -lacks excitement   -retarded voice-acting   -John Dalton sounds like a dork	-1
Yes folks, it's sad but true, but this game is a very poor port of the PC version. I wonder how the programers could waste the potential this game had on a machine that delivered us a firt gen game like Halo. I was excited about this game; although even the PC version is a less than fantastic game, i kind of liked it. Than comes the time for the Xbox version, and what a disappointment. The graphics are a mere shadow of the PC version. Like the other reviewer said, the cutscenes are terrible, i couldn't beliave my eyes. The graphics are bad for even those who never played the PC version. Not that i don't think that Xbox can recreate the graphics of the PC version, because a machine that can deliver us games like Halo and the wonderful "PC port" of Return to Castle Wolfenstein certainly can do that. Ok, the graphics are bad, but the gameplay is still good, right? Wrong, it feels like the programers didn't pay much attention in porting the gameplay to the Xbox control, because it's very jerky. At least the sound is still good, but that's it. I am a huge Xbox fan and i had high hopes for this game, but all i can say is to avoid it.	-1
This game just had so much potential. Sweet graphics, cool storyline, gameplay like Halo, Xbox Live Play. What the hell happenned then? I popped the game into my xbox, started a Single Player game and was immediatly greeted with an ugly cutscene that looked like it was programmed for the Atari Jaguar. I thought "Well ok... the graphics will get better... and the gameplay will kick ass... right?" WRONG! I got into my first battle and I thought I had a slow mo cheat on. I mean, the game was chugging at about 3 frames per second. To make matters worse, the monsters have 2 frames of animation. And no, I am not exagerating- the monsters literally look that pathetic. As the game was pretty much unplayable at that point, I just gave up "playing" (more like watching a flip book) and sold it as fast as I could. Not having Xbox Live, I could not test the online component of the game... but it has to be better than single player. Overall, I would stay far way from this and go buy Halo or Halo 2 or Brute Force or pretty much any First Person Shooting game out there. If Atari had actually taken the time to iron out all the bugs, Unreal 2 actually has some ass-kicking potential. As it is, the game is an over-hyped piece of junk.	-1
There are some points I'd like to make clear before I go any further.  One, it's now 2007 so it's been a while since this was released.  Two, I only tried single-player story mode before stopping (more later).  Three, I LOVED TS: Future Perfect.  I definitely seem to be in a different corner from other reviewers.  Generally people love this game.  After 3 levels of single-player mode, I realized it was pi**ing me off more than providing fun.  Looks aren't a problem.  Unless your a graphics fetishist there's nothing to complain about how it looks, even today.  Not too blocky, nice environments, smooth framerate.  The problem for me arises in the actual gameplay.  First, I hate aiming with my thumb, and prefer a fixed site that moves with you until you choose a zoom sight for, say, a rifle.  This sight is hard to zero in with and almost impossible to use on a moving target.  Choose not to use aiming mode and who knows where your shots will land?  If you're happy thumbing it, then it won't be a problem for you.  But over and over I found the missions (played on medium difficulty) to be obnoxious.  The save system sucks big time, and you too often find yourself playing an entire level over and over again if you mess up.  There are checkpoints here and there, but you lose them if you have to quit.  I don't always want, or have the time, to play through an entire level.  Granted, they aren't horribly long, but I'm the type of player who likes to take his time and look around.  If you're the blow-through-as-fast-as-I-can type, it might not be a problem for you.  I just put it away in frustration after getting tired of failing several times for no apparent reason on the 3rd mission (the "rescue the girls from zombies" one).  That's about the gist of it for me.  With other reviews being so glowing it may be that I just don't "fit" the game.  Or, maybe, having played Future Perfect first ruined it for me.  Still, that doesn't remove the frustration factor from this one.  Sad, that, since, as I said at the beginning, I absolutely love love LOVE Future Perfect.  That game really has it all!  If you haven't played either this or Future Perfect, I strongly recommend FP but you might want to rent this one (if you can find it) or buy it very cheap.	-1
Time Splitters 2 is one of the most anticipated sequels to a first person shooter that I can remember.  I played the first game and was impressed by it.  The multiplayer was one of the best to date, and the overall game was really good.  Not unbelievable, but good.  Now we have Time Splitters 2 and I am a fan of the first person shooter.  It's not my favorite type of gameplay, but I do like it and I also like it when companies who develop first person shooters do their best to try and mix the style and game play up a bit.  It isn't that TS2 isn't uniqute, because it is, and it's actually pretty cool going through time and venturing into all those far and away lands.  The real problem here is, well, the game is just too damn hard to enjoy.  This coming from someone who has beaten Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Solid on its hardest levels.  The first level, in Siberia, and the Atom Smasher level, are two of the hardest mission I have EVER played in my video game history.  It took me 3 hours to beat Siberia and 6, yes that's right 6 hours to beat the Atom Smasher level.  So as I finished up TS2, I realized that for just being a first person shooter, with a lot of cool guns, this game is not worth recommending.  Buy and play it if you wish, if not, go for Red Faction 2 or Agent Under Fire.	-1
No, it isn't. Not even close. Bland story, decent gameplay, subpar graphics. It's not as emmersive as Halo ever was. And compared to te Red Faction series, this game isn't even close. Nice level editor and multiplayer, though I wish it was online.	-1
I LOVED EUI and II and thought that this game would continue the progression of those games.  I have been mostly disappointed so far.  The AI is very weak, the game logic is lacking in many departments (Diplomacy is one of them), and the game is buggy.  Once you get the basic hang of the game it is not possible to lose as the USA, Germany, Britian or Russia. (Haven't played Italy or Japan yet). The minor nations are playable but not worth playing really - I tried playing Nationalist Spain and Turkey and it was boring)  I do not really see much replayability in the game, except to the extent that you can vary your technological research and get different weaponry to achieve your ultimate goal - world conquest.  I just felt that the real depth that I associated with the Europa Universalis games is lacking here.  Maybe more will be done with the game as time progresses and maybe the players will mod the game as well but at the moment its going to end up sitting unplayed in its cd case because I think I have really done all that's worth doing with the game.  Save your money until its upgraded some, or until there is a HOI 2.	-1
First off, let me just say that I had a great time playing GTA 3. It was a game that could make you do things that you would never dream about doing in your life, making you belive you really were a person who did all sorts of underhanded and disatstourous things in Liberty City just so you could make cash and stay out of trouble with other gangs. The missions were varied and long, the locations of and around the city were very detailed, the weather effects were spectacular and it was very hard to put the game down after you'd already been playing it for two days. It was the game that shoked the world and brought forth a new gaming era for more mature players.   Unfourtunatley, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is almost identiacal to the 3'rd in the series. This could be a good and bad thing for all players, let me explain.   If someone is new to the series, they can master Vice City just like someone could with the 3'rd game. Needless to say that the city in this game is completley different, it feels more like and expansion pack rather then a fresh new game.   To back this up, in Vice City there are all of the things that you wish you could do in the 3'rd. For insance you can go into buildings, fly more planes and helicopters, drive motorcycles and scooters and have a whole new arsenal of weaponry. This sounds cool right?   Wrong.   Even though these perks are interesting to the game, they just don't make you feel like you are playing a whole new game.   Also everything is set in the 80's, from the clothes to the cars to the radio songs, which are all real songs from the 80's.   Don't worry, there are still some halarious commercials adn fun mini games to find hidden across the city.   And about the missions and graphics. For this game, Rockstar North has hired real actors that have stared in a variety of movies do the voices for your bosses in the game. This is pretty cool because the cutscenes sound so proffesional! Yet the missions in the game are not as fun to play or as varied in styles, which can really seem repetive. However, the graphics are, in a way, a let down. There are great lighting effects in the game, but the buildings, inside and out don't look as grand as in the 3'rd.   To wrap things up, Vice City sounds like a fresh and new idea with everything you've come to love and respect about videogames, and in a way it is. This game would be great for someone new to the series or for people who don't care if it's almost exactally like the 3'rd beside the various perks that make it seem like and expansion pack.   But for those of you looking for a groundbreaking new game in the Grand Theft Auto series, you won't find it here.	-1
Scratched and didn't work	-1
No strategy in this game at.  Units have horrible pathing and NO sort of structure. No support units of any type means it is a rush to build the big bad quick and hope you simply outdamage your enemy.  It also has it's own rush for resources which is lame.  Coal stacks are never enough.  Perhaps Battle Realms spoiled me with the living resource model... but these coal piles deplet way to fast which means you just have to expand and land grab quick every game (once again, no strategy).  Awful game with a great idea.  Could stand to use to a sequal if they actually put in some content rather than that tepid single player campaign (which is so insanely dumbed down to get a T rating).  The online part of this game is really bad... the matching room is a massive step down from things like AoM and even Red Alert... It is also incredibly laggy and just a rush for resources. The graphics are ok... but otherwise, I wouldn't buy this game ([bummer]! I already did).  I hope this is not what we have to look forward too in Homeworld 2...	-1
I was expecting this game to be easy but it wasn't ' i think sonic team at least shouldve added a handicapp mode on story mode where it gets easy but instead they didn't ' the levels are just to hard and annyoying and walkthroughs make it sound like the game is easy when its not	-1
Hello its me again the expert game player. I don't know why many people like this game. First it takes place in vaction city, I mean how boring is that. You are driving through churches, and schools. But it is kinda fun to steal the popemobile and run over popes and priests. The soundtrack is a little weird like you've got kumbiyah and john denver songs. Im gonna conquer vatical city now. Goodbye all.	-1
Vice City is basically GTA3 with 80's music and a more involving storyline thrown in. In fact, if you took away the 80's music, I think most people would agree that there really aren't enough new GAMEPLAY elements to justify an entire new game. This should've been a GTA3 expansion pack or more accurately, "Grand Theft Auto 3.2" on sale for [...].	-1
This game is just flat out horrible.  If you want a game that is fun to play over and over again, and want great graphics and everything else you should look elsewhere.  There is no variety in this game whatsoever.	-1
what can I say, it's just like the old game.  BORING after 10 minutes! Don't buy it.	-1
I can't believe this game!  I paid $[money] canadian, and when I played it, I found out that you have to BUY your GAME CARDS online!  Basically, your wasting...bucks so that you can play a very basic demo, unless you are willing to pay $[money](u.s.) for each virtual deck!  There are a few 'up' points in this game; the avatars are cool, backrounds add a nice touch, and so do sounds.  But, really, I hope I can get my money back for this phony game! I'd have to say, if the cards were included in the game, I would rate this game a 4 or 5, but paying for more on top of the game is just dumb. I mean, come on; THIS GAME SHOULD BE FREE!!!  You should get it for free, then pay for the cards (hey, it makes sense, huh?) I can't believe I'm stuck with something I can't use...	-1
This is not the same as playing magic in real life.  If you already have a huge collection of real cards like me, you will have to start all over and pay for a bunch of "virtual" cards. Get the magic the gathering interactive encyclopedia, if you can even find it (I suspect wizards phased it out to make people buy this).  It lets you play online and use any cards you want - even replicate your real life deck, or improve it. The encylopedia does not implement the rules, so you need to make sure you play with people who know them.  Otherwise its much better than this.	-1
I cannot get past the first scene because the main character moves around in real slow motion.  It's terrible. It takes her a minute to "run" across the room which is not very big at all.  I don't know what's wrong with this game but I know it's not my computer. There are 3 different ways to install it and I've tried all 3.  I tried changing the setting and everything.  I cannot get it to play right.  I would not recommend this game.	-1
The Broken Sword series marked my entry into the adventure game genre, for as a mostly console gamer, I ignored a large number of classic PC titles.  Those games, and The Longest Journey got me hooked, and so I thought I'd check out Syberia which seemed to offer much of the same formula.  But that common formula of obscure puzzles and pre-rendered backgrounds was about all that Syberia had shared with those classics.  The game's plot - which in all adventure games is the make-or-break factor - is completely underwhelming.  Perhaps it is unfair to compare Syberia to Broken Sword or TLJ instead of evaluating it independently, but there is really very little substance to this game no matter how you look at it.  In fact, it is only by virtue of a storyline that adventure games' often frustrating mechanics and obscure puzzle solutions are even tolerable.  Without a story, an adventure game - much like Syberia - is quite unfulfilling.	-1
I'm not sure where all these great reviews came from.  I hoped that this game would help wean me off my addiction to the Her Interactive Nancy Drew games, but it didn't even come close.  I thought that moving the character around was clunky and slow, and even when I knew there was a key or something that I needed to pick up or interact with, it took me forever to maneuver around in order to do so.  The only good thing I can say about this game is that the scenery was nice to look at.  After playing 3-4 times, I gave up entirely.	-1
Where did all the great ratings come from? Did they actually play Syberia? I found this game a true yawner - over simplistic and dull. I paid 20 dollars, might as well finish it type of game. It should have been named Almost Syberia since you never actually get there without buying the sequel. I now need my own wind up key for a train to oblivian since this game drove me mad.  I believe the Adventure Game developers need to quit wasting their time along with ours and come out with a real 'adventure' game. A game with great graphics, great interaction and mind boggling puzzles (without the use of hint/cheats). I'll pay the extra 10-20 dollars for it!	-1
Syberia is a textbook case for beauty in games, but its gameplay really leaves a lot to be desired. Not only is the game over too soon, but it is FAR too easy and the puzzles are boring. The characters are fine, but the attempted development and maturation of the main character, Kate Walker, really was not particularly well-done. The game's main problem is that the point-and-click interface just really doesn't work out in this case. The screens are too expansive and Kate too small and slow (running or not) to keep the gameplay interesting, and, again, the puzzles are just not particularly thought-provoking. None of this changes the fact, though, that you will want to explore this beautiful world simply for the reward of seeing everything. It's just too bad the gameplay didn't reach the bar the graphical design raised.	-1
I have enjoyed adventure games in the past, in particular Lucas Arts titles like Grim Fandango and the Monkey Island series. The positive on this game is that it is beautifully illustrated. But the puzzles and rather simpleminded. The story line is fairly interesting, but it also seems to be striving to present some political correctness. Your character is young women who is an attorney. I think the creators are trying to make you think of your character as becoming more independent as the story goes along, but this is done mostly through conversations you have on your cell phone with your Mom and your boyfriend, neither of whom do you actually meet in the game. Also I expect more from the music of such an artistic game. Having said all that, I probably will buy the sequel that is planned.	-1
I find this game to be okay, I am not crazy about the camera and controller setup. I think Blood Rayne II makes great improvements in these areas. I bought this mostly because I am a fan of Blood Rayne, (I wish the movies had been better). I wanted more insight on Rayne's beginnings. So I bought it more so for brand loyalty. I think the game is okay, but the second one is much better. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blood-Rayne/dp/B00006B0NR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blood Rayne</a> <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blood-Rayne-2/dp/B0001I9YG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blood Rayne 2</a>	-1
Despite the highly impressive introductory scene and menu screen, don't be deceived.  This game is far too conventional and undeniably sloppy.  Terrible low quality graphics and messy animation, lifeless paper diorama-like environments, corny cliched looped background 'noise' which fails to evoke a dark, haunting atmosphere.  The controls can become extremely confusing and frustrating in times of crisis (plenty of mutilation, blood spillage and cleavage wobbling though).  The characters are in many ways stereotyped and dull yet cheaply sexy and appealing (in the busty exotic bombshell type way - a cross between Elvira and Mortal Kombat's Sonya Blade). The concept and storyline (or lack of) is shallow and focuses more on show-casing stereotypical gothic style, lacking substance and depth. It's a shame, this game potentially could've been much better.  It certainly doesn't do justice for the X-box either...  It's still an appealing short-lasting novelty like playing old platformers for nostalgic value.  It's fun and wasteful but certainly not for those who want a worthwhile challenge.	-1
This is one of the few X-box titles I got rid of before completing the game.  It just isn't worth a lot of play-time when there are many, many, more well made interesting games than this one.  I guess I should be more specific. Graphics - mediocre.  Monsters, buildings etc. appear very two dimensional.  BloodRayne looks hot in a skin-tight cat-suit, but that is intersesting for about 10 minutes. Gameplay - mediocre to poor.  Method of jumping, shooting, changing weapons is unatural and awkward. Story - goofy.  That about sums it up. I definately would not buy this game.  As a rental, may be fun for a couple of days.	-1
This was the first Blood Rayne for the PS2.  It has good graphics, controls, sound and music.  The Graphics are low budget.  The controls are a little stiff.  The sound is great and so is the environments.  Blood Rayne takes place during World War 2.  Rayne is half human & half vampire.  She has plenty of weapons to use against the evil vampires.  Rayne wants revenge against her father for killing her human mother and family.  She has a cool attitude and very optimistic.  You can kill the enemy a number of ways.  Sucking their blood, chopping off limbs with your blades, and shooting them.  Plenty of moves to learn.  There are boss battles along the way.  Some are easy and others are plain tough.  The sequel was the best between the two.  Blood Rayne 2 had more moves, abilities, weapons, etc.  Pick that one instead.	-1
I imagined this game to be Kain from Blood Omen transported to MOH:FrontLine, and the gameplay isn't far from it, though its a bit grosser(sexier?) to watch Bloodrayne grind on her victims as she drinks their blood than it is to watch Kain.  However, while MOH:Frontline and Blood Omen (I & II) all offered good storylines, Bloodrayne is ridiculously lacking in that capacity: Agent Bloodrayne must go after  her vampire rapist father who is in league with Nazis in 1938 after having watched her mentor get eaten by a huge parasite that was created by a nazi in cahoots with a Cajun Witch in Louisiana (psssssssss.......I think they stole this plot from a Stephen Seagal flick). The graphics varie greatly from part to part.  Bloodrayne herself is rendered beautifully, but many of the enemies look like they stepped out of a fps from ps1.  Also the difficulty varies alot from place to place which can be annoying, the first boss is pretty difficult, but then you get a bunch of cake opponents to fight for a pretty long time.  I was also dissapointed that the gameplay does not really involve stealth at all seeing as how your supposed to be an AGENT INFILTRATING Nazi Compounds and such.  However, this game has so many problems that the fact that Nazis wait dumbly in their rooms while a crazy rambo inspired vampiress goes on a loud killing spree is the least of a gamers worries. If playing as a hot chick that slurps blood is your thing then I recommend this game.  If vampires are your thing then get Blood Omen II, or Soul Reaver II.  If playing as a hot chick is your thing get Drakan: The Ancient gates, or wait for the new Tomb Raider.  If fighting Nazis is your thing get MOH:front Line. verdict: wasted money	-1
Rated 2.5 (middle of the road)  This game has many clever elements, like a game where a wave of zombies is entering this house, you are not allowed to leave it and must blast zombies as they enter the room from different doors. The effect is like being able to play around inside a Romero horror film, to a certain degree. Graphically, this is an arcade-looking game, but it's focus is more on its difficulty than story, character, graphics, guns, modes or anything else.  I am disappointed in the music, the title screen techno is pretty nice, but mostly the music is either unimpressive, repetitive techno or something like Danny Elfman run through a computer. When you're shooting up zombies and aliens, subtlety is not needed. Ideally, the music should have gotten your blood pumping.  What I really enjoyed was the level designs, some are far better/worse than others. You can go to Notre Dame and 1930's Chicago (a Perfect Dark reference?) right next to each other. However, I never knew *WHY* I was doing whatever I was doing, or why and how I'm able to move through time or change genders, as it was more left to the imagination, because there's no intro cinema scene. So obviously the characters and story meant nothing to me, I didn't have a reason to want to get further in the game beyond seeing new level graphics. The levels themselves are nice, but seem more like a wide hamster tunnel than detailed, realistic, full areas. There are plenty of areas that lead to nowhere and wasted space. There's just not enough to do in a level like the Dam to want to go back to play it again and again (like Goldeneye 007), moving through the endless repetitive layers of stairs simply on a higher difficulty level w/ more objectives doesn't thrill me. I liked the more bizarre characters but most are military, old-fashioned or zombies - they're all in a tacky cartoon-ish style, baggy pants, gargantuan breasts, PVC suits and so on in lame PS2-quality models. If you like Aliens, Plasma weapons, black leather, guns that take up 25% of your screen, techno music, futurist settings and so on, this should be a hit. I alternated between accepting the game on it's goofy terms and wishing it were either more serious, goofy or just plain better executed. It's fun while it lasts, but the biggest kicks I got was from the absurdity, references to Perfect Dark/007 (when it's hardly anything like either of those games, you won't play it nearly as much - more like Quake), and graphics for levels. I do actually enjoy this somewhat, but if this is the Best FPS of *2002*, Vgame genres could use a cerebral revolutionary bath.	-1
the game dident work on my refurbished gamecube system i got from gamestop i love this game and disappointed i coulden't even play it :(	-1
It is horibule. Do not buy it.	-1
In my first review I gave .hack only two stars,but after having played a couple more hours,I can honestly say that that's too good of a rating for this terrible,back-end stink of a game! I would give it zero stars but that's not an option...   How many horrible things about this game can I mention?Let's see,oh yeah,your weapons and armor level up by tossing them into a pond,and depending on what the weather is like,it get's weaker or stronger...sound stupid?Wait there's more!   You can only use skills(spells/special moves) if you're wearing certain weapons or armor. Levels mean nothing;no learning cool spells by leveling up the old fashoined way,all you have to do is sport the right threads! WOW!   You only get a certain amount of EXP depending on how many levels the monster is stronger or weaker than you. I guess just having a set amount of EXP for each monster is just too much to ask! Let's make something even more complex even though you already have to learn 5000 diffrent rules just to play this peice of junk!   Don't be fooled by thinking that this game has two worlds... this game always takes place in the online game"the world";the real world is just the computer desktop with that annoying music. All you do on the desktop is read pointless e-mails that tell you boring ...,and if you don't kiss every character's ... in the game they'll get mad at you and won't play with you....oh,darn!   As for the whole "illusion" of being on an online virtual world, that's a total joke! The dungeon graphics are VERY bland and repetitive; in fact if it wasn't for the flashy cutscenes,this could easily be put on the playstation 1!Oh,and the other "online players" say the same three things over and over, including the ones that join your party!   And as for the whole story,I just didn't care! It doesn't ever make you WANT to find out what happens next. The plot isn't gripping at all;I mean yeah,you're friend goes into a coma,but as to why he did,it's just abstract and stupid. Some ghost chic get's chased by a guy with a pink staff and then he beats your friend with it! UGH!! And you're telling me that Bandai wants to drag this out to three more sequals!?   Also,controlling the camera manually gets really,really old! At first it might seems like a good idea,but you'll get a headache constantly switching the camera back and forth. It gets tiresome doing this just when walking in a dungeon,but when you've got a group of enemies that always run out of view....   Lastly,the music was completely indistinct and unnoticeable; Super Mario Bros. 1 had better music than this!  Please rent this game before wasting your hard-earned cash on it,like I made the mistake of doing!	-1
The game controls don't feel right when playing the game.  For me, there's too much stuff for me to remember how to do as far as pushing buttons.  You're also constantly at the camera controls so you can keep your eye out for enemy portals.  If you can forgive all that, then the game's story is worth the hassle.  If not, read the manga or watch the anime.	-1
Over $100 for a 1 axis joystick? Are you kidding me? This is a 20 year old design, using parts that are dirt cheap by now. It should be $20.	-1
Thrust has a design problem and they admit it. The main reason I bought it was the supposed quality of parts used to build. The outside plastic has rough seems on them and are very noticeable. The CH manager is gerat program works flawlessly for anything I have asked to do no problem there. The mini stick is were the known design flaw is and no amount of a dead zone fixes it. The y orientation of the stick is on spring and only centers properly if you let it snap back or with a minor manual adjustment after slowly releasing it to center again. the spring does not do its job properly. Any customer service request will result in the company giving you a much more technical breakdown as to why the stick you have is operating properly. I have roll assign to it ( no pedals $$ atm ) if do a slow roll when I let off slowly or gently it continues to roll. This is a major annoyance and has only become more of annoyance now after I learned it is designed that way and it is passed my return period.	-1
I enjoy long role playing games, like the 70+ hour type. That's why I was intrigued when I heard the mention of the new 4 part .hack series. It had an interesting premise in that it recreates an online world through offline play.  Unfortunately, the game is just pure tedium, and getting to the end really feels like a chore. All the game is just one endless dungeone crawl between each randomally generated dungeon to the next. Your clues are spelled out in the 'email' snippets you get.  Hardly too exciting. You'll easily forget the reason you're playing by the 5th hour or so. Especially since so little of the story is spelled out in the 1st game. Why would it be when they want you to buy the next 3 at $50 a pop?  Most weapon acquisition (which is done through a frustratingly limited inventory system) is done through the 'fun' act of trading. And the weapons and armor are so poorly balanced you feel the need to hold on to each piece, as one piece holds no clear advantages over the other.  I really can't imagine why anyone after getting to the end of the first game, having played through 20+ hours of the same random duneons, and battled against the same variety of enemies (who are only differented by name and color) would really want to invest in the whole 'series'.	-1
This is a weird RPG with a weird plot. Bad graphics. Ugly environments. The The fighting system is bad. You have to stop. Characters are not who you'd care about. Just a bad game.	-1
I found this game to be one of the worst games ive ever played. Why, why is it so bad. Heres an idea, get a life. Get over the anime and stop voting 5 because you "love" the anime. This game is way too short. I did plenty of extra dungeons, and found this game to be so, incomplex. I traded this guy for these knives at the beggining, and I NEVER found a better weapon, too easy. Anyways, heres the problems. -Cannot change the class of character, any weapon you find that aren't dual sabers cannot be equipped ever. -The dungeons are repetitive. They use the same terrains and pots and dead bodies and stuff. -Trading system boring, its basically the only interaction you need. -People say the same thing constantly. -In total, this game has 64 characters i believe. All together, civilians and players. I got the ryu book and it told me. I honestly don't know how boring it can get then 64 characters.(like 12 of them being playable) -Boring plot, your friend goes in a coma, some chick is running around, and the game doesn't have any plot. -In order to mooch as much money as possible from the game, Bandai decided to release FOUR, F-O-U-R Games. For FIFTY dollars each. Meaning this series requires 200 bucks to be completed. Considered the first one took me 15 hours basically, Bandai could of easily fit in more, instead they want more and more money. Basically this means the game isn't even a full game. Its a PART of a game. Good things -There are so many bad things. Dungeons that look the same over and over, the same pots, dead bodies, and destructibles, and the same items. BORING -Theres no good things I can think of, its a boring game, get over the anime.	-1
I was excited about this game at first but found the game to be a big disappointment.  Zenasaga is a much better game. My biggest disappointment was game play.  Graphics are poor and the dungeons are plain and boring.  Bandai should take note of the game play in Kingdom Hearts. The movies, however, are well done. A fiend broke his .hack CD.  Bandai would not replace it for a small fee as other video game companies do.  They wanted the full [amount].	-1
Very plastically, extremely outdated software and documentation.  Good flight control and accuracy out the box.  Customization is a pain, if the game lacks native support.  Throttle feels decent,  buttons in excellent placement.  I like the 4 hats at the thumb.  Needs more switches on base for better HOTAS capabilities.	-1
Well, I didn't want a Tv in my room because my new computer has the ability to play live Tv and It would take up too much space, so I ordered this item in hopes of playing my Wii, ps2, and nintendo 64 on my monitor. BUT it didn't have the right cord that plugs into my computer and was unable to use it so I returned it. DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HDMI CABLE INPUT IN YOUR COMPUTER!!!	-1
Very plastically, extremely outdated software and documentation.  It's almost as if the company doesn't care if you buy it or not.  Good flight control and accuracy out the box.  Customization is a pain, if the game lacks native support.	-1
The game idea has great potential, however the camera angles our disgusting to say and you spend a lot of time fighting them. The controls are slow and has so many bugs in the game that you would think it was made by amateurs. It saddens me to say since I love Tomb Raider DON'T BUY IT!!! your just going to get frustrated and fed up with it. My guess is it was a rush job by then judging from the amount of screw up in it. Save your money its not worth it!!!!! I ended up useing a cheat disk to get round all the screw ups in the game!!!!	-1
I thought I was getting a PC game? the description did not say it was for playstation 2?  I don't have a PLAYSTATION 2 or othwise.	-1
The first Tomb Raider was what got me interested in the Playstation console.  Over the years they've gotten progressively better.  Then there was a long lapse between the 4th installment and now.  What in the world happened!??!  This title is utterly useless.  The controls are terrible.  The camera angle is annoying and the levels are very uninspiring.  Then you have this interaction with other humans that is just useless.  You choose certain sentences and that is supposed to alter the game somewhat.  All it does is use up precious game space on the disc.  Utterly useless!!!  The music, is beautiful.  But these games are known for their music.  The graphics are nice, when you can see them.  The game is way too dark.  I know it supposed to be dark as you are in a tomb, or cavern, but it doesn't have to be that dark to where you can't see certain objects or other nuances.  I also judge a game on how I can just sit and play without reading. In this instance, I had to consult the manual because the controls weren't intuitive.  Like the auto-aim and manual aim.  Some of the "bosses" were so lame.  At first you think it's going to be a challenge.  But, you try and try and try, and you can't beat it.  Then you do the unthinkable.  You consult the web for a walkthrough and when you read it, it's like, "How dumb is that!!".  After performing the moves to kill the creature, it was really quick and not very satisifying.  They include this lame "Making of" which is supposed to be insight on how the game was designed and what it took.  All it did was waste space on the DVD.  Who cares how you made the game.  It didn't give any special insight into the way it was created because the game itself is terrible!!  Overall this game left a very bad taste in my mouth.  One that I hope will not resurface in the next installment.  My recommendation is to skip this one.  If I could give it less than one star I would, but Amazon doesn't have that option.	-1
When I first saw this game,I was happy that another Tomb Raider game came out.  When you first begin to have make Lara get "stronger" and it was really hard for me to make sure my jumps were lined up correctly.  I think Eidos should've spent a little more time on making this game. And also the game was way too easy to beat.  Because I didn't like so much, clearly this was the worse Tomb Raider game I've ever played.	-1
My first game I played on playstation was Tomb Raider, I loved it. I played all of them before I played this one. Then, I tried this one even when I heard many bad things from reviews, but still I wanted to see it for myself and they were all right. This game sucked. Many times was too slow (walking in slow motion), it was kind of like Metal Gear (but embarrassing Solid Snake), there were not enough puzzles (and the ones it had were boring and repeatitive), the design was bad, and the graphics I expected more since this was the first tomb raider on PS2 (I liked better the previous games the way she used to move). I miss the adventure like Indiana Jones, and I still remember the other games of Tomb Raider; but this one is forgetable.	-1
I'm a huge Tomb Raider fan. I was anticipating the release of this game, little did I know it was the most pitiful of the Tomb Raider series.  Graphics--  There were times when I saw the insides of her face when angling the camera right.  The biggest problem would be that this game was created on a block grid. That's terrible for a PS2 game, especially when you're forced to use the analog stick which leaves you with less control over the character.  It all depends on the angle of the camera when you jump. If you set the camera towards the characters feet, s/he'll jump farther than you need him/her to. When you have it set above him/her, s/he won't jump as far no matter the upgrade.  There were tons of glitches. I remember this one time when I'm standing still, then all of a sudden I'm floating to the sky. Sometimes your enemy won't transform to the "adult stage" which sucks because you need that to happen so you can move on. Many of my friends swap similar glitching stories. And if you're not careful, the game can skip a level.  Gameplay--  It's definitely not worth playing if it's THAT hard to control the character.  It would be more fun if the manual was correct; Switching targeted enemies is not the triangle button, and switching targets is crucial towards the conclusion of the game.  You have to upgrade your strength. This was a hassle because you can easily miss your opportunity to upgrade and be stuck somewhere for hours.  It takes more than 2 seconds to pull your weapon from the holster and 2 more seconds to shoot. Hand-to-hand combat is just not worth it because it takes even longer. Talk about a slow reaction.  Story--  I won't spoil anything. I've read tons of reviews from the creator on the official Tomb Raider site, and on other game sites. They admit to not finishing their game. They were rushed for time. And it shows. You actually have to collect more items to fit the story (You have to collect 5 paintings but in the game, you only collect 1.) So you'd be right in assuming the run time is short.  It doesn't pick up from where Tomb Raider IV left off. It leaves you wondering.  I didn't get a bad copy of the game. It's all copies of Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness. I have three copies, and played a rented one. They all suck.	-1
In this day and age, are we as gamers really expected to put up with this level of crap? Possibly the biggest disappointment in the history of videogames since the Sega Saturn, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is the first next-gen outing for the intrepid Ms. Croft. Stuck in development hell for the best part of 2 years, Core and Eidos should be very, VERY ashamed of themselves for allowing such a bug-filled, poorly thought-out piece of software onto the shelves, much less a game with such a rich and popular reputation to live up to. Put simply, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is an absolute dog. First: The graphics just do not cut the mustard. Granted, the human characters in the Tomb Raider series were never graphically astounding, but here they're just badly done. Textures are pixelated and the frame rate is low. Lara's animations are smooth and her new costumes are diverting, but that's it. Characters like Bouchard and Carvier are not good enough for the PS 2, being underdetailed and very badly animated. Level design is very substandard for a TR game. And, horror of horrors, there's only one tomb, The rest of the game is like a horrible cross between Metal Gear Solid and a weak RPG, where Lara is forced to run about Parisian streets and warehouses with no real sense of raiding anything. Second: The control system is an absolute abomination. Lara is just not meant to be analog. Gone is the intuitive quad-style floor layout and now jumps and falls are impossible to judge, the upshot of which is Core have created a game which is insanely easy to beat. Lining up the camera, controlled by the right analog stick, every time you want to make a jump, is just annoying, and the collision detection is ridiculous. Third: This is such an easy game to beat. Although I should point out, you'd better get to like the phrases 'Overwrite Successful' and 'Load Successful', becuase you'll be seeing them a hell of a lot. Thanks to the ridiculous control system, Saving and Loading happens far more often than is acceptable, and when you do manage to make the jumps and climbs without the control system hampering your every move or the game crashing out (happens a lot, sound and event glitches abound) you wonder what happened to the rest of the level. A horrible, horrible game that yields no rewards, and will cause great distress to fans of the TR series, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is something we should all forget. Core, never let this happen again.	-1
This game is a huge disappointment because they spent so much time working on it but it still is crap. Awful sound and the camera is still the games big problem. It's not very long and after you beat, you don't want to play it again so you wasted money. don't buy it.	-1
Tomb Raider was one of the first games I played on the Playstation 1 back in 1998 (when it was still called merely the Playstation). Back then I was thoroughly impressed with the game's combination of exploration and puzzle solving gameplay. Now the Playstation 2 brings Lara Croft back for a new adventure and the results, to say the least, are disappointing. Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness' main problem is that it doesn't give you anything new. It's all been done before. Sure there are some stealth moves that are now incorporated into the gameplay. But all of Lara's patented moves are here, but they all seem rather passe' by modern game standards. Lara jumps, flips, and climbs with her usual flair but it's nothing we haven't seen before. The controls are often so sluggish you'd think that Lara was walking in mud when she was performing alot of these moves. It feels as if the game was rushed unessecerily to meet a deadline. The game had been in fact delayed since Febuary of 2003, but it seems that all that extra time in development did not help any. The graphics are standard "Tomb Raider". Lara still looks like the same old Lara. Which is somewhat of a let down. When you compare Tomb Raider: AOD's graphics to other contemporary PS2 games such as Metal Gear Solid 2, Splinter Cell, SOCOM:US Navy SEALs, and even it's explorer counterpart Indiana Jones, you feel that so much more could have and SHOULD have been done to beef up the graphics of a game like this. At the very least Lara's character model should have been updated to give her a more photo-realistic look. The streets of Paris are rendered nicely but the environment overall looks rather plain and sterile. You don't get any feeling that you're going anywhere special. The action often at times suffers from MASSIVE slow down. Which really hampers gameplay. Running at a steady clip is reduced to a veritable crawl. I could go on but suffice it to say that this game is a huge letdown on so many levels. The series is now in the midst of changing hands to a new developer, Crystal Dynamics. Here's hoping that they can breathe new life in this ailing franchise.	-1
looks like this game was put on the market long before it was actually completed. Lots of glitches, awkward camera angles, rough control of movement in general. It's a good thing the game allows you to "save" at any point during play, cause you're going to die a lot! She's hard to control and will fall to her death with monotonous regularity *yawn*. Other than that, pleasant enough graphics and story line (typical tombraider stuff). Nothing innovative and would have greatly benefited from a little more work prior to game release... boo hoo.. definitely rent before buying.	-1
Despite all the hype and all the delays, "Tomb Raider: The Angel Of Darkness" turns out to be just a waste of plastic. The game would've been great had the designers taken the time to fix up the unacceptable amount of bugs and glitches, and come up with a new and different style of gameplay. What do I mean by that? Every single movement Lara makes is animated and much slower than it ought to be. A three-legged dog with one eye could swim through a pool of molasses in less time than it takes Lara to run from one side of a room to another. Not only that, but simple actions like crouching take at least 3 seconds longer than they should. And don't get me started on jumping. Jumping from ledge to ledge is about the only task the developers could come up with for you to do. Apparently, it's the camera's job to make it seem a lot harder than it is. If the camera's turned just slightly to the wrong angle, you might end up doing a side flip to your doom instead of jumping forward. The puzzles that you come across (rarely), are usually idiotic and unrealistic. At one point in the game, you're asked to get from one side of a room to another, unfortunately the only way the door on the other end will open is if the laser security system is activated. The first thing you should notice is that these lasers are very poorly placed and any real person could easily just step over them or duck under them. Of course, being the tomb raider she is, Lara must use a series of timed run-and-jump moves to get through them, making what would be an extremely easy sequence to get through into a much harder one. You'll learn early to save all the time. The game is extremely glitchy and freezes up in certain areas, usually when there's lots of things going on at the same time (like when three lights are turned on and there's another guy in the room). Also, since Lara dies inconsistently, you'll never know if that jump to the floor below is too far or not. I found that in certain areas, a ten foot fall to the floor can result in death, while in other places, falling forty feet will only slightly hurt your life bar. Then there's all those nagging questions. Why is it that setting yourself on fire will slowly drain Lara's health, but stepping into a laser can kill you instantly? How come it takes seven bullets to kill a guy with no body armor? What kind of dog dies after two kicks, but remains alive after being shot several times? What's the point in the stealth mode if you almost never have to use it? In the extras section, why do the game designers claim that '"Tomb Raider" has always set the benchmark for games'? Why does the "Cradle Of Life" movie trailer have such messed up audio? I could go on and on. In conclusion, all I have to say is that "AOD" was not worth the wait and isn't worth your money. Save it. I hope Eidos decides to speed up the gameplay in the next "Tomb Raider" installment and gets some developers that aren't mental patients to work on it. If not, I won't be buying it.	-1
Another boring Tomb Raider game; complete with the same goofy puzzles and blocky interface. Nothing new here, just the same old game with better graphics. As for Lara's "big guns", ho-hum. Kids looking to see Lara's barely covered cha-chas will not be disappointed but is that really worth the cost of this game?	-1
Clunky,almost impossible controls...camera angles that refuse to correct themselves...did I mention the horrible controls? Try to move in a direction, she turns around! And what is with her constantly drawing her gun when you try to jump onto an object? Did I mention the user-UNfriendly controls? One star deserved because they finally got past the lousy polygon graphics and went with smooth texture mapping and some very nice light sourcing. By the way, the light sourcing SLOWS the game down (you'll see that right away on a rainy rooftop). Oh, and my game went black screen twice, in the first half hour and had to be restarted. Too bad I waited so long for this. I personally looked forward to a revisit to TR One and Two. Such ground-breaking games. Hope this game gets better or it goes in the shiny frisbee stack.	-1
Hitz is a game you turn on, pick a team, and ten have fun dragging your best friend up and down the ice!  It's about big hits and bigger scores.  So why all the changes?  Hitz 2003 is more like any old standard hockey game. I have many gripes for this one and I'm writing this review only two days after it was released. First off, Where is the screen where you can input codes like "win fights for goals", "no puck out of play", and my all time favorite, "unlimited turbo"?  Yeah, some of them can be accessed through the options menu but not the good ones which I've come to love...and the game blows without them. Secondly, I started playing a francise mode game.  Played a few. Won a few. And, you guessed it...lost a few too.  After a while, like any other normal human being, you get a little weary of playing.  So, the million dollar question...What do you do??  Very good, you save the game.  The next day I decide to go and have another shot at the game, to see if I like it any better than my first impression.  NOPE.  I come to find that my game never saved properly and had to start fresh all over again.  Nice, huh? Third, the gameplay isn't as fast, or good for that matter.  It isn't as easy to score, the big plays that should don't, and the ones that shouldn't do.  The puck, cpu players, and even your own player don't react as well as the did in 2002. Next, the game crashed on me a couple of times already.  Not just that, it's slow as hell loading, not as it's booting up, just when you're fooling around with jersey colors or checking out some of the rinks and things of that nature. I could probably go on and on about my dislikes of the game here but I think most of you will get my point. In my opinion, THIS GAME [is not good]!  Most games following in a series try to take a couple of steps forward with each new installment.  This one fell back about ten miles....or more. If you happen to be a really big fan of the series (which I am or was at least) RENT IT FIRST.  Trust me!  You are not going to be pleased.  Otherwise Stick to 2002.  It's a far better game.	-1
First, let me say, Enclave has beautiful graphics. But after playing it awhile, I found myself frustrated by my inability to generate my own character, or to be able to start out with a character of my own gender (female). True, later on, you can select a new character at each level, but after a while, I just found myself NOT caring about playing any further. I prefer games with a little plot and a LOT more diversity at the get go. Enclave just failed to grab my interest.	-1
Grafix, good artsy goes with the mood.  Only good point! Theam and Story, been done to death, nothing new or interesting.   Run aorund trying to kill things. Controls, slow and awkward, can't aim at all. Action Combat, There is no combat system at all.  Run around swinging wlidly and hope you eventually kill something. Challenge, with out aim or combat system simple weak monsters  are potentially deadly, Only cheats may help. Over all, this is two stars worth of game, thats all.	-1
... Once again this is a game that should rented and not purchased. The game is really terrific and I would have given it a Five-star rating if it hadn't been for major flaw...no mid-mission saves or checkpoints. Of course you might be thinking, "Big deal"...of course you also haven't played the game yet. If you actually purchase this game be prepared for costs exceeding the initial price. For example, the cost of new controllers (which you will smash in childish fits of anger), the cost of a new Xbox (which you will ruin because of repeated ripping out and putting back in of game) and the cost of a new TV (which will have one of your smashed controllers embedded in it). I'm all for challenging games, games that don't hand the answers to you, but this game is a bit on the sadistic side. The total lack of a checkpoint system is just far too frustrating. Other than that, the game is great. The weapons are sweet and the graphics are out of this world. Dolby 5.1 surround sound really sucks you into the environments and the storyline is pretty decent. The controls take a little while to get used to but, so did Halo's and we all know how that turned out. So take my advice and go rent this game, play it, ...	-1
The followup to one of my favorite Playstation 1 RPGs of all time, Legend of Legaia, has definitely improved upon every aspect of that game and then some. Developed by the team that made Wild Arms, Legaia 2: Duel Saga begins in a small village called Nohl where a young hero named Lang & his friends are tossed into a monster infested land where the crystal they protect(an Infinite H2O supplying Water Crystal) is stolen right from under them by a mysterious traveler named Avalon. The theft soon plunges the land into a horrible state. Bound by duty & a need to protect his village, Lang sets off into the world to get the crystal back and end the mayhem around the countryside. Needless to say- it's not as cut and dried as you think. Avalon is more dangerous than you first expect. And that's where your journey truly begins.  The real star here is the games' battle system or, better known as, the Tactical Arts System. Learned through scrolls, Arts combinations, and story-based events; the different techniques can all be chained together to form bigger more powerful attacks. The massive variety of possible combos are almost endless. The battle graphics are absolutely stunning at times with all kinds of pyrotechnic special effects and whatnot.  Legaia 2: Duel Saga shows alot more promise than the first game, for sure, yet there is one small thing that bothered me about the game. That being the battles or lack thereof. I spent most of my time looking for more battles to face than actually wanting to move along the story. Still, it's a small gripe and didn't take any enjoyment from the game. If the truth be known, I guess, in a sense, I appreciated the fact I could take a breather between battles. Still, it woulda been nice for them to have upped the ante of the battles just a bit.  Regardless, Legaia 2: Duel Saga is still worth your time if RPGs are your thing. I loved the game & seriously hope we see a third in the series. If not for the PS3, then the PSP instead.	-1
They traded it's great gameplay for graphics;this is very evident with all the pointless un-skipable cinemas. Plus they made the characters shout their battlecries in english instead of japanese,and hearing a guy say "yeah!" for the 150th time gets old. I hated the fact that they introduced a concept of "combining items to create better ones";I've never liked this in a game cause you either end up with something really cool(with help from a guide) or you end up with something worthless. Plus you only win combining-items after a battle,instead of a powerful weapon or defensive armor/accesory. Needless to say that's all you can steal from enemies as well which completely takes all the fun out of stealing. They also did away with a free-roaming world map(in legaia 2 it has an arrow that takes you from point A to point B and back and forth....no exploring!)I felt that was unforgivable! The game also made the enemies alot harder for some reason. This is very noticable in the second area of the game when you go into the mountains. As for the traditonal ra-seru type creatures that you could summon by defeating them in battle(in legaia 1)I have no idea if they return in this installment. As far as I played I did not find them,and that was too long for me esp when you learn them in the very begining of legaia 1. I'll keep playing legaia 1,but I'll pass on legaia 2.	-1
This game is really cool if you are a fan of john carpenters thing. But...it sucks. It has two MAJOR flaws that kill the mood of the game; The voice acting is terrible, and the controls are agonizingly frustrating. also, the NPCs are kinda dumb, not all the time, but every now and then, which is annoying when your party members have all the machine guns and you have a crappy pistol, and suddenly you are ambushed by hoards of enemies. Only buy this if you are a HARDCORE fan of the thing like me, otherwise, stay away...stay faaaaaar away.	-1
game goes on for ever with nothing happening  waste of time  poor graphics	-1
So i went surfing for old games i might enjoy playing, never expected this to be more expensive now then when it was when released.  Good LUCK selling it for 60+ dollars.  I'm sure i can find it in some backwater store locally for a decent price 10-20 dollars.  Yeah the outrageous price annoyed me enough to post this. GL NEXT.  I've played it before at a friends, it was "okay" but not 60 dollars, save your money get Deadspace 2 for 9-10 dollars on amazon currently, MUCH BETTER GAME, and for 1/6th the price.  Short of that, i'll just wait until doom 3 becomes one of those "free download games" in a few more years, its already ancient...	-1
You like hallways?  If you can answer yes to that simple question, you'll love Doom 3.  If you, like the majority of people, think hallways are really not very interesting, then you're going to absolutely hate Doom 3.  And with good reason: 90% of the game takes place in one long, dark hallway.  The major differences between levels usually consist of the difference between ramps and flat ground, or catwalks versus regular ground.  I played about 75% of the game, and I remember walking out to the surface of Mars about 3 times.  I remember about 3 levels that were not hallways.  They were short.  I am currently on level 34 out of 40, and I'm about ready to put this one away for good.  Level design aside, the entire game suffers from being incredibly long and repetitive.  The same bad guys, the same boring guns, the same little hidden areas, everything (in fact, there's only one new gun in the entire game, and it's ammo is so limited you can hardly use it).  Every single time you see a dark corner, you might as well load up your chainsaw and just start walking forwards.  You could do it the proper way I suppose, by switching from flashlight to revolver and blasting, but why?  You'll run into the same 4-5 zombies and one dark-orange-demon-guy, pick up some random ammo, and wonder why you spent so much money on this damn game.  Overall, one of the most disappointing games I've ever played, because the graphics, even 6 years after it's release, are pretty darn nice.  Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I have to say about it.	-1
I could write a three page review of what all is wrong with this game. It's terrible. I'm amazed at how bad it really is. I played Doom 1 & 2 for years when they came out and they are much better than this garbage even without any nostalgia. It's hard to find anything at all good to say about it. I guess the graphics are the best thing, but even they aren't anything all that special. Games that came out 3 years prior were at least on par with it. It has the worst sound of any fps I've ever played by far. The explosions and the sounds of the weapons are absolutely pathetic. It's not spooky at all, which I thought was supposed to be the big deal about it. Bioshock has it beat easily in every aspect. I've played it for about 10 hours and I've not died yet so I'm not angry about difficulty or anything, but it's just so boring listening to voice messages, reading in game e-mails, and the combat is terrible, just room full of surprises where you can't help but take some damage then here's some health and armor and it's on to the next room. The engine even sucks. Maneuverability is awful. Story is a predictable disaster. I can't stand this weak mess of a game anymore, I'm not curious as to what happens next in the least. Not worth $2 much less 80.	-1
This game got a lot of press when it was new. Dark, creepy, it marked a resurgence of horror FPS games and pressed the boundaries of the hardware of the day.  As of Dec 2007, however, it doesn't do that any longer and there's darker, creepier, better written games out there. As we enter 2008, 8PM on a Thursday night, there are only ~10 people on all the servers that my copy found tonight. Doom3 might have a lot to be said for it in multiplayer mode, if people were still playing it, but they're not.  If you're toying with buying this game today, buy it as a single player FPS, and buy it cheap. Half-Life2, Prey, and a half dozen other, better written, FPSes are available in the same 15-25 dollar price range. If you can find this game under $20 and have a deep love of id Games, go for it. If you'd rather just find a good single-player game, blow that $20 on something more compelling.	-1
This game is good on it's own but it's just not Doom.  If Id had stayed true to the game that made them and remade it it would have been 100 times as scary as the alien looking things in this game.  This game feels like if you went to buy a DOOM game but got Alien Resurrection with hell.  The monsters in this game aside from the zombies are terrible and look like garbage.  Np pinkies, no cacodemons, no barons( no their not), no hell-knights, no spider demons, to aracnatrons, no rooms full of monsters to blast down, the weapons again look like an Alien movie not Doom except the chainsaw,  the controls are not near as good as classic doom or quake causing the multiplayer to be pretty much useless,  id just could never get to that level of greatness again.  I mean look how how butchered the Quake series is since Quake 1.  Thankfully Id has been stopped and bought out from ruining their game series with garbage like Doom 3??, Quake 2, Quake 3, Quake 4, Quake enemy territory, or Heretic  II.  Doom Knee Deep In The Dead all the way through Doom TNT/plutonium project w. Doom Legacy is all you need, the best game ever made with easy new multiplayer, bots modes and extras.  Get the Doom collectors bundle instead of this crap, way more fun going into actual Hell to fight actual demons not poorly designed aliens/mutants.	-1
Up to this game, id games almost seemed to have a Midas touch; everything they touched turned to gold. Many people felt whatever they got their hands on was surely going to win game of the year, or at least receives high accolades. As a fan of their games I would have agreed, until I got this game and played through it.  First off I'm going to say that the whole flashlight thing didn't bother me as much as it did others. And various other niggles that other people screamed bloddy murder over, I was willing to look past. But there were other things that were quite frankly unforgivable.  To be honest, this game was a good deal of fun for the first few parts. The graphics were unbelievable, the atmosphere was great, and the story was actually not bad. I figured the game could only get better; I was wrong.  The biggest problem is that all of the game's pros eventually turn into massive cons. The graphics are great, but what good are they when all you see are narrow corridors? What good is the atmosphere when you are in constant darkness? (I actually had to pump up my monitor brightness because I could never see what was going on) The story was the same thing over and over: finding PDA's and opening a door. That's the kind of puzzle system that Wolfenstein 3D operated on over 10 years ago, but I had prayed would be phased out completely by now. It's really a shame because there's some areas of the game that are truly breathtaking. The scenes on the terrain of Mars took my breath away, but these were few and far between. Why didn't id games use more open surfaces? Many fans have clamoured the same thing.  I can sum this game up in two words: boring, predictable. You walk into a room. You kill everything in sight. You pick up a PDA. A monster spawns behind you, and you kill it. Another few spawn, and you kill them. You move into the next room. Lather, Rinse, Repeat. The problem is compounded by the narrow hallways. It's next to impossible to use the BFG or the rocket launcher because you're likely to do more damage to yourself than the enemy.  The multiplayer isn't even worth mentioning. Remember, id games are the ones who realized that multiplayer was the way of the future, and designed Quake 3 Arena (one of the best MP games of all time) with this in mind. They were mimicked by the Unreal Tournament and Battlefield series. And then they come out with this, which scarcely has any worthwhile multiplayer component. Why do this? I simply don't understand it. id games literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.  I'm sorry, but I simply cannot find any real reason to purchase this game. I wasted my money on it, but hoped that the mod community would make up for id's lazy multiplayer component, but that never happened. If I could go back I would have definitely returned the game. If you must have it, wait for it to hit the bargain bin; at least then you won't feel too bad about forking over a few bucks.	-1
Having a DSL connection of 1.5/1.0M, I wasw shocked to see how slowly online play was (avoid games with more than 4 players on even this high connection.) - especially when compared with Unreal Tournament 2004 (which can EASILY handle 8 players.)  But the main solo play game is a lot like Half-Life; even some of the sound effects are the same!  It's the same old follow-the-path structure and apart from a few unsuspected scares (don't have a weak heart when playing this one), has no replay value except for multiplayer - which I'd recommend, MINIMUM, a 1.5/1.0 DSL connection.  Doom3 hogs internet bandwidth even more than UT2k4, et al.  Id could take a lesson from Atari about how to better use bandwidth.  UT2k4 is exceptional by comparison and is surprisingly playable on 256k down/up speeds.  Overall, it's a good game, but don't pay more than $18 for the original and $15 for the Ressurection add-on pak (so wait a few months).  Anything more is exploitation of an uncreative product that should be faster with online play.  (All the players and texture/bump maps are on each PC, what exactly are they sending over the internet that's dragging things down?!)  Looks very nice and is playable even on my lowly hardware (see below), but it adds nothing to the genre (it even goes backwards; the flashlight has an infinite power source, good grief).  My system:  Abit NF7 mobo (nforce2 chipset, dual DDL).  Athlon XP 2100+ @ 2700+ C{U  1GB RAM (2x512 modules)  Nvidia geforce 5900fx video (128MB RAM) from BFG  SB Audigy  Again, for solo play it'll run great at 1024x768, ultra quality.  But for multiplayer, get the best down/upload bandwidth you can get.  (cable users note, download speed may be ~3MB on a good day but upload speed, also crucial for game play.)	-1
My friend recomended I get this game..ITS SOOOO SWEET!  IT'S SOOOO VIOLENT.... This game is soooo stupid is what I told him.  This games story was pretty intresting at first but then it all falls down. UGH!  The graphics are horrible!  The combos are unique..One of em' I'm still trying to learn but I stoped with the game. The game is pretty violent but as Violent as I thought it would be. The game gets pretty boring after awhile and it's very dull. I'd give it 0 stars if I could...But I can't... :( Well If you wanna waster your time with the game be my guest...I'm forcing you not to play the game cause hey...I can't..what els is there to say.... So go out and buy it with your own opinion. But for me...I'm gonna have to say this game sucks big time...	-1
Being a Blade movie fan and a PS2 geek, I was excited about purchasing this game. Unfortunatley, it fell beneath my gaming expectations. The graphics are "cartoon" like, the 360 degree movements start to get annoying if not dizzy, and the lack of a map will leave you directionless although their are "glyphs" that help occasionally to steer you in the right path but not enough of them. Those three thing that I pointed out was enough for me to wish that I had rented it before I purchased it.	-1
I rented this game and to my horror I had to use the right anologue stick to fight, that's so uncomfortable. I played it for 40 mins and took it back to Blockbuster and that's the first time I've done that with a rented game.	-1
As of late we've seen some movie licensed games be surprisingly good (Spider-Man for one), but Blade 2 isn't one of them, and is one more game on the list of poor licensed video games.  Fans of the Blade movies (like myself) will be vastly disappointed here, as the game has little to do with the film itself.  Your objective is to get from the beginning to end of each level while solving tried and true "find the switch to open the door" puzzles, while at the same time going at hand to hand combat with an assortment of enemies.  As the game progresses and you earn more and more points in the levels, you can begin to unlock Blade's exotic assortment of weapons; ranging from a pistol, a shotgun, the glaive (the silver spinning boomerang type weapon in the movie), and UV grenades.  As you keep on fighting enemies, your Rage meter (very similar to what was also called the Rage meter in Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage for the Dreamcast) builds up, and when it is filled you gain access to Blade's sword to hack up your enemies with.  When this happens you can also trigger special kill animations where Blade kills an enemy in a semi-cool fashion and adds a catch phrase to boot.  While this does seem like a cool concept on paper, the repitition of this, as well as the overrused catchphrases by some voice actor other than Wesley Snipes, can get rather annoying and detract from the gameplay.  Enemy AI has never been dumber, and you won't have a hard time dispatching most enemies.  The controls are rather stiff, and recovery time from jumping can prove to be rather troublesome.  The graphics are half decent, nothing spectacular, but the pounding repetitive techno soundtrack will make you want to turn the volume of your TV down.  All in all, die hard fans of the Blade films or comics may find some degree of enjoyment in this game, but all others should avoid.	-1
I too eagerly awaited this title and was disappointed. Much hype about little content. You may go blind trying to play this one. 90 percent of the game is played in utter darkness. Hearing creepy noises all around you only works for about 10 minutes than becomes frustrating. It seems that all this darkness means little attention must be paid to the actual graphics. The box graphics are way better than the ones in the actual game. You run around in the dark until something moans. You frantically try to bring up your flashlight while it draws closer. After seeing whatever it might be, you switch to a weapon. Then again your back in pitch black, mean while your foe has hobbled off the side. Forget about firing flashes from your weapons to help you see your target. Apparently weapons don't flash at all when being fired in the dark on a Mars space station. If you actually hit something it soon fizzles away like a bug in a bug zapper, pretty lame. If you really want a fun FPS of this genre, try PAINKILLER and it's new expansion pack. It is a much better looking game and an over all better time. PK beat Doom to the punch with a much better game. Sorry guys.	-1
You've got to rent,it's the only way to protect yourself from stupid games...And this is one of them.	-1
(*Review based on Demo*)  Perhaps many people go for the appeal of being left in the dark -  and it definitely adds to the spookiness factor - but I just found it, well... annoying.  80% of the game you're either in the dark or can't see but a few feet in front of you. Its sort of like trying to fight in a box... its just rediculous.  There is nowhere to crouch down and hide or use any sort of tactics. Instead, you're just mindlessly running through areas, trying find stuff to shoot at.  Seriously, you can't use a light-mounted gun this far in the future?? Considering our current military has this ground-breaking technology, it should be available in a future military base on Mars...  Sorry, this game just didn't do it for me... download the demo before you blow your $50.	-1
Yes, darkness is scary in real life.  But when you're playing a video game, darkness is annoying.  This is supposed to be the 22nd century? And the marines can't figure out how to hold a flashlight in one hand and a pistol in the other? No night vision goggles as standard equipment? They don't know how to clip a flashlish to their rifle or helmet?  Dumb, just plain dumb. At least give us the option of playing in darkness or playing in light.	-1
The graphics for Doom are the best anywhere right now (assuming you have the flashlight turned on so you can see them).  Most of the time the game is pitch black so you demons can jump out at you.  Initially the demons were frightening, then the simple A.I. became boring, then it became anoying.  The enemy is very predictable except for some of the scripted events.  The flashlight was annoying because it could not be used along with weapons.  You have to lower your weapon everytime you use it. (Mods are available to fix this, but the game seems to be centered on leaving you in almost pitch black to make it frightening. Without the default flashlight set up the suprises are minimal.)  I quickly found the gameplay becoming boring because it is very similar to the original Doom.  Personally I prefer more tactics in my gameplay.  Halo 2 and Half-Live 2 look better, but I look forward to the Doom engine being used on future games with better gameplay and A.I.	-1
This is not the DooM that I expected.  This is a totally new fps that just borrowed the name of the original.  All that I was looking for was the same type of map based game, instant shooting, find the red, blue and yellow keys, shoot a butt-load of demons, watch out for the green acid, shoot a lot more demons, get to the exit without dying (maybe even find a secret exit).  This game lacks all of the things that I was hoping for.  Instead they ruin it with a plot, cutscenes, lack of finding some weapons until the end, yadda, yadda, yadda.  However, if this game were called something else like,.....um, I don't know....."Extremely Dark Game With A Flashlight"...I probably would have liked it a lot more.  Like I said this isn't DooM.	-1
Negatives  Ok, I'm half way through this game and I have to say that I'm not impressed.  The plot is WEAK.  The game play is linear.  And instead of making it challenging in other ways, the designers had a brain storm...Lets make 90% of the game in the dark!!!!!!  So you have to switch from flash light to gun and back again.  I have died more times in the dark shooting at where I thought the enemy was located then any other way.  The story line is so simple a 6 year old could, and might have, come up with it.  I just wish the programmers would have spent more time on the story and less on deciding what places need to be without lights.  Lastly, their joking about the retail price being $79.99.  This game is barely playable and I got it as a gift.  I would feel seriously shafted if I paid $20 for this much less $80.  All in all, play Doom 2 and save yourself a bunch of money.  If you want fun, play the ID classic, Wolfenstien 3D.  Positives  Graphics are good, not worth the requirements but they are good.  The sound is good as well.  I also like the fact that you can go onto the Martian terrain.  The one thing I do not like is the short amount of air that you can have.  Many people can hold their breath longer then the amount of air you have in an oxygen tank.  All in all one and  stars	-1
UPDATE:  FUN: * * * (3 stars) OVERALL: * * * (3 stars)  Well, below is the review I wrote after a couple of hours of gameplay. As someone else said, it starts out slow and then the story develops. Later in the game you get couple of new guns and new "FREAKS" show up! -It seems someone did not pay a lot of attention to detail for the weapons. If there are 3 rounds left and i push in 5 more rounds to make total of 8 rounds..you don't need to pump the shotgun..a round is already in the muzzle. You pump the shotgun if you completely run out of rounds and feed fresh 8 rounds, now you need to pump one into the chamber before you can fire. Apparently...this is something simple and should be expected of all FPS by now. ITs little things and attention to detail that make all the difference between a 3 Star and 5 Start FPS  Most importantly, This game is the most "SCARY" game ever. (period)  ----------------------- ----------------------- Overall, this game is weak! The only good things about this game are the Graphics. The Game play is bad, same old going through levels and shooting bad guys. Same old guns that make sad sounds. You are playing the whole game is darkness...but if you need a Flash light you need to switch to Flashlight and then switch back to the weapon you were using. "what the heck, can I not have my flash light taped to my gun". and them, you are at a Top notch research facility (Weapons research and what not ) but there are is no Night Vision goggle's. You fire the same old guns...that ofcourse look different but are no better. Let me put it this way: Half-Life was better than this game (except the Graphics) and lets not even start comparing it with HALO, cause this game is not even close to HALO. oh and did I mention, this game has to RE-PLAY value to it. Do NOT buy this game, you'll just end up wasting your money. Wait for Half-Life2 and HALO2 to come out, I can bet they will be better than this piece of junk.	-1
Why?  Why did id spend so much money, and waste so much artwork on the lamest remake the world has ever seen?  The level design is so bad that it boils down to nothing more than a pretty arcade shooter.  This is the kind of game they put in arcades to try and give you as little play-time as possible.  The plot: exactly the same as doom 2.  Nothing new, original or creative.  Game play:  Move 10', fight a horde of monsters.  Move 10', fight some more.  Move 10', some jump out behind you, then more teleport in all around you--for no reason.  Level after level after level of pointless arcade style shoot-em up.  There is no horror, no suspense, no story line.  Just a constant jerk on the trigger finger to see how good your relfexes are.  Castle wolfenstein 3D gave all that ten years ago, and was much more fun to play.  My advice: Do not waste your money on this.  Far Cry is half the price, with comprable graphics, better game play, and a much better story line.  Judgeing from the previews, Half life 2 will also offer much better game play, graphics and story line.  I want my money and time back.	-1
This game requires a super computer. Even with my 2 ghz processor, 1 gig of ram, and ATI Radeon 9700 Pro it runs terribly at 1024 x 768 and 800 x 600. The graphics are good when you manage to get the framerate high enough, but the action is just dumb. Its all finding you're way through poorly lit rooms with monsters in them. Plus, you're flashlight is another weapon so you need to swich back and forth between the flashlight and the gun. Its all mindless run and gun. No strategy or tactics at all. The rag doll physics are horridly unrealistic, and unlike the upcoming half life 2, there are only 5 or 6 objects that you can interact with, like cones and small boxes, and they move very unrealistically when shot or punched. The multiplayer is a joke. 2 vs 2. Need I say more? My recomendation: Wait untill Half Life 2 comes out on September 1st. It even comes with the new counter strike. Just stay away from this game.  HIGHS:  Good graphics  Tons of material (the news on the TV's, Video clips on you're PDA)  LOWS:  Takes a supercomputer to run  Terrible multiplayer  Bad action that takes no strategy	-1
While I have only spent three hours playing this game, I am quite disappointed and wanted to get the word out as fast as possible. On the positive side Doom 3 reminds me of the PC game Aliens vs. Predator 2, which was scary as a single player game because of the darkness and theme. But AvP2 used the darkness to make the game fun despite the poor graphics. But while the graphics are good when the near constant darkness doesn't prevent one from enjoying them, the interface is too classic Doom. There is no realistic vision enhancement such as NVGs, or even lights mounted on weapons. Thus one must go from flashlight to weapons (of which there is the classic too many to really carry) and back again almost nonstop, which is lame in a high-science, future based game. Monster spawning is also lame as they spawn from cleared areas.  The worst aspect of this game is that the creators do not take advantage of even established innovations in FPS games, such as leaning or alternative fire/view.  Overall this game is essentially Quake I with better graphics, but with too much darkness; not worth the asking price by a long-shot. The monster AI also stinks compared to even Quake 2, although I was fighting mostly zombies.	-1
After more Doom3 time under my belt, I started to wonder, what these guys have been doing for FOUR YEARS making this???  Were they hand painting, and editing each level down to the finest detail?  I hope not, because its so dark, few people are going to care about some nice thing here, or a nice thing there.  Doom3 is so devoid of quality story and gameplay that it has me wondering..  Every level shows something Doom3 people copied from another game, literally tons of things from various games out there - including Painkiller and Halo.  Lets see some great games, and stop being a technology graphics lapdogs for ATI and Nvidia where you appear like your just trying to impress them, and not make games for gamers that are innovative, and new.  Doom-3 is a poor game, does nothing new to the genre, and bores you to tears with endless waves of the same repasted levels, mobs, and pathetically weak guns.  Sad.	-1
I am excited about this game but when i got it today I barely could run on my P4 1.5 ghz. Turns out you have to have a hella fast computer and top of the line video card to run this game. I just don't have that kind of money to upgrade. Don't waste your money on this game if you don't have the hardware.	-1
D3 is looking really nice but I have to agree with vanzagar... Kingpin 2 needs the graphic enginge...I also like to add that KINGPIN is the best gangster game ever.....Why doesn't amazon have this on sale?....If some one knows please post if for me.... This game has bin delayed so many times its probably not going to come out...I loved Doom 1...I was an addict to that game...I never played D2 but I can't wait for D3....I saw the Trailer for Xbox version and that also shocked me..Cause the Graphics are just as good on the pc version!.. Oh well...Hope this game comes out soon...	-1
Why is this game getting pushed back so far?!  At least Valve had an excuse (source code got stolen) but Activision doesn't have a leg to stand on.  I upgraded my PC when I heard about these games...now my upgrades are obsolete!!  The funniest thing is that UBI Soft came out of nowhere with FarCry and beat Valve and Activision to the punch.  This game better kick massive ass for all of these delays!!	-1
Okay, I apologize for my earlier review.  For some odd reason I was reading reviews on this game and someone said to run it with a keyboard.  Well, I have a force-feedback steering wheel which worked very poorly on this game (VERY POORLY).  However, when I started using the keyboard this game was as fun as the NFS games of old.  The physics model does stink in my opinion compared to Colin McRae Rally 4.0 or Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed, however it is fun.  ----OLD---------  I have every need for speed game ever made from the original Need for Speed to Porsche Unleashed. They were all great.  This game is HORRIBLE!!!  Save your money.  I don't know who coded it, but to say that the physics model is bad is a GROSSSSSS understatement!!  The gameplay is beyond bad, it's a travesty!  I just tried it and it runs fine, it just .... horrible!!  I just installed it and played it 1 hour ago.  1 hour from now it will be uninstalled.  Oh, it's so bad I feel bad even selling it.  I'm going to write that it's bad in my item description just to stop people from buying it.  AHHH!! run!!	-1
ok, in CDS you play as four guys in the military, who are friggin' stupid. I mean, when you compare this to a game like  Socom, it starts to make you wonder, why am i even playing Desert Storm? The graphics.... horrible. They are N64 quality  and the cutscenes are just as bad as the graphics. Your teammates... not such a big help. When you tell them to hold their fire and a Iraqi is right next to them blowing their brains out, what do they do? Sit there getting shot. The game isn't realistic. When your shot in the face, your still alive. Sure it helps you but its unrealistic. And when you use an anti air craft missle thing and use it on the tanks, nothing happens!  I was never in the military but don't grenades damage tanks, and shooting them in the side should hurt them. But no. If you want to play desert storm, invite 3 friends over. Oh yeah, the menu screens... Craptastic! With the horrible presentation, bad ai, lack of realism and strategy leaves this game to warn people to probably rent it.... Or not    2 out of 5	-1
Has to b used with outdated Microsoft explorer version to even work	-1
I would've liked this game had it been the sims. People tried to send me sim city and pass it off.	-1
I've heard so many people rave about the Sims over the past couple of years that I finally decided to break down and buy it. This is one of the few times that I have to say I honestly have no idea what the big deal is all about.  The Sim is a "people simulator". You create little people, plop them down in a house and control thier lives. You buy them clothes, furniture, make them meet people. Just about everything real people do. And that's basically the problem.  The thing I that I found least entertaining about the Sims is that the whole game revolves around what I call "micro-managment". Every last little detail you have to scrutinize. Though some might find this appealing, I found it tedious and boring. It makes me feel less like I'm playing a game and more like an accountant. The game is also quite slow paced. Even if you speed up time, the game can move too fast and then you can really lose control over the game.  The gameplay consists of a "point, click, and watch" formula for gameplay. You click on an object, your Sim person will walk to it, use it, and then go back to being idle. After time if you develop a pattern the Sim person will do things on his own, but that takes a while. After endlessly pointing and clicking and watching, I started to do things like try to set my Sim person on fire, or not have him go to the bathroom for a while. It is rather fun to torture your Sim person but it wears thin after a while.  The graphics are good. The Sims speak in some kind of jibberish. And there's lots of Sim skins available for download on the internet.  All in all I'd have to say that I really don't get this game. Maybe it's because I'm more used to games like Metal Gear Solid and SOCOM that I have trouble playing a game of this type. I tend to like having more direct control over the outcome of a game. The Sims made me feel like I'm a spectator. I'd have to say pick this up only you find a really good deal. Otherwise it's best to take the $20 you were going to spend and pick up something else. Sorry, but this is one I can't recomend.	-1
When The Sims first came out to rave reviews a few years ago, I promised myself I'd buy the thing if it was ever released in a cut-rate deluxe-box format.  Well, this fits the bill, so I finally broke down and bought the thing.  And this turned out to be the most overrated game I've ever played.  I'm sure you all know the theme and basics of the game, so I won't bother rehearsing them, but I will point out several absurdities that make this game an artificial exercise in finding different ways to accomplish whatever the computer forces you to accomplish.  1.  You have to do the same thing over and over, and it gets boring.  Relieving your Sim's "Bladder" bar by going to the toilet is an obvious example, but there is so much other routine nonsense to handle that you find yourself clicking the same commands day after day: taking a shower, cooking food, calling friends over to your house, talking to them, talking to them, talking to them, now and then watching TV with them, but then having to stop watching TV so you can talk to them yet again in order to raise your "Relationship" score with them.  I'm amazed that so many reviewers called this game "engrossing."  There are maybe ten things you do in this game, and you do them over and over and over.  2.  If you DON'T do these commands, your various mood bars will rapidly start to suffer; this will harm your overall "Mood," and that in turn will cause your "Job Performance" to deteriorate and your interactions with other Sims to fail as well.  Since when is your job performance determined by your mood?  That's an example of what's wrong with this game: it's not really about directing a simulated human being's life; it's about figuring out the best combination of commands to keep your Sim's mood bars high.  That's very artificial.  3.  These commands themselves are also unnatural.  You can't sit and talk with someone; if you're sitting on a couch (thus raising your "Comfort" bar) and want to interact with your friend (and thus raise your "Social" bar and your "Relationship" score), you have to stand up first.  But this immediately causes your "Comfort" bar to drop.  (For that matter, your friend can't even sit on the same couch right next to you, because the couches aren't "group activities."  Your friend has to be sitting on a DIFFERENT couch.)  Also, anytime you leave your house, your "Room" bar drops precipitously, so if you're doing anything outdoors, you're not likely to be in the best mood while you're doing it.  That's absurd.  In real life, my mood doesn't deteriorate when I'm outside playing basketball, and it doesn't improve afterwards just because I walk inside my house.  4.  You can't ever visit anyone else's house.  Now and then neighbors drop by to visit (often helping themselves to your food and amenities), and you can always call someone up and invite him or her over.  But no one ever invites YOU over.  So your whole life is spent inside your little sim-house.  5.  Some of the random events are annoying.  I got hit with a miserable clown who wouldn't leave my house and made me miserable too; he wouldn't stop bothering me until I called the "Clown Catchers" (who look like Men in Black) to remove him.  The first time, it was kind of creative and cute.  But then it happened again--almost immediately afterwards.  That's just annoying.  Same thing with the burglar who breaks into your house at night and steals your furniture: the first time he stole some stuff, I thought it was clever.  The second time, it was only a sign of how impoverished this game really is.  Couldn't they think of other random things to happen to me before hitting me with a crazy clown and a burglar TWICE?  6.  Acquiring "skills" is no less artificial.  Don't even think about cooking anything on a stove unless you've read some cookbooks first, because you're virtually guaranteed to start a fire.  (I've never read a single cookbook in my life and don't consider myself a gourmet, but I'm able to make a simple and nutritious meal without burning the house down.)  Need to improve your "charisma" skill?  Talk to a mirror.  And talk some more.  And talk some more.  No thanks.  I'd rather play something else instead.	-1
I didn't really enjoy The Sims as much as i thought i would since it's just like real life(pay bills water the garden watch T.V. go to the bathroom, eat ect.). and for another thing theres not too much depth to the game. all you can do in this version is stay in your house and run the lives of the people you create. to get the most out of this game you are gonna be shellin out big bucks for all the expansion packs. the only good (well actually funny)thing that you can do is kill the sims you made by starving, drowning, or burning them. there might be some of you out there	-1
I HATE ALL SIMS GAMES!!!! Listen ppl!! The game is just incredibly boring! Whoop de doo da.. I'm having so much fun watching my Sim stare at a TV screen with a still picture on it!! O JOY!!! Get with it.. the game is plain bogus ok..if u wanna play god..I suggest another game... Trust me I've [bought] 2 expansion packs and the original Sims (and I'm 13 so u can guess that took away pretty much my whole fortune).   Like other reviewers said, there is always something missing in the Sims...something that makes it just not worth your money... and no matter how many new objects, or pets, or downtown areas Maxis is gonna come up with, there will always be a hole in the Sims. And that hole won't ever be filled. Why?? Because it doesnt have an ending. It has absolutely no point whatsoever! ...I assure u you'll be ticked off at the huge amount of memory it takes up. To sum it all up..It's expensive, takes up too much space, fries ur brain, gets annoying, has no point, and is an overrated...	-1
its great for people with newer computers, i.e ones with windows ABOVE windows 98. but why stop at just livin large? they should have put ALL the EP's into one game. i been talkin to all my sim fan friends, about how they should make something like this, and after only TWO YEARS(?)! they make it. they made too many ep's.. who ever bought ALL of them, they would have probably needed a whole computer just for THE EP'S! its good they made this newer version, but they should have added more than just ONE ep to the game. whoever's mad about buying all the ep's, they can just sell them. by the way, don't get SIMS ONLINE, unless you want to pay a MONTHLY FEE, every month just for playing a game...	-1
Avoid this dog-pile... Look, lots of people like lots of different things. I HATE THIS GAME. I couldn't get rid of it fast enough. The graphics are crappy, the game play is utterly repetitive. Did these jokers spend any time designing this product? You will need to be a real die-hard fan type of person to enjoy this more than a few minutes. You cannot turn into the flying mode at will. That sucks. And the graphics look like a kid's coloring book. Get yourself a used copy of "Mechassault" or even "Battle Engine Aquila" & you'll be better off.	-1
This game also won't let me play once I download it and I am very frustrated I was looking forward to adding more things to my game and being able to have pets would have been so cool.	-1
The strays really get annoying, running around the house. The objects are cool, but don't add much. Sometimes the game would freeze and I'd have to restart the game. I'll stick with the reguaLar Sims.	-1
This game would have been great back in the 90's, before gamepads, It is a game which is played with the combonation of joy stick and keyboard. However it is good for the kids, if you want your kids playing games which involve shooting, etc.	-1
...definitely not worth the 200 dollar asking price.  I've used this screen because a couple guys I know bought it, but I'm much happier with my 7" DVD player, which with the addition of 8 bucks worth of adaptors can have an Xbox, GameCube, or PS2 (or for that matter, VCR) hooked up to it.  Takes any RCA input.  Total price for DVD player plus adaptors (which were just male to male RCA adaptors) : 208 dollars.  And it'll play 3 hours worth of DVDs on BATTERY POWER!  Not to mention that I bought the darn thing months ago, and now you can get similar ones for about 175 instead of 200.  I don't know why anybody even buys these Xbox/PS2 screens anymore.  But they do.  Hell, pay 175, get the adaptors, brings you to 183, and that leaves you 17 dollars towards the 30 or so it costs for the DC/AC inverter that will power the whole shebang in the car (or HMMWV, for that matter).  I brought my Cube, PS2, and Xbox over to Iraq (it's going to be a long year, gotta have the games!), and I'm glad I chose a screen that works easily for all three.  If you have only an Xbox, and extra money, and really just want your screen to aesthetically match your Xbox, go for this...otherwise, buy a darn 7" DVD player...it's a no-brainer!	-1
i wish they made stars of 0 cause this i verry poor. even with a car amplilifire it's worse than playing halo on cell phone.  sucks	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS!! IT DOESNT COME WITH A CAR ADAPTER AND YOU CANT PLAY IT ANYWHERE BUT NEXT TO A TV!!! YOU NEED 2 WIRES GOING INTO THE WALL AND ONE GOING INTO THE TV AND ANOTHER GOING FROM XBOX TO THE MONITOR!!!!THE GRAPHICS ARE SO BLURRY IN HALO YOU CANT SEE THE COVENANT!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS $170 PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!YOU NEED A TV FOR THIS TO WORK TO WHATS THE POINT OF BUYING IT???(...)	-1
Trust me when I say this game is weak. I don't know what all the 4 and 5 star ratings are about for this game. If you are under 15, maybe this game is interesting. BUT if you have played MOH or COD, Counter Strike, Raven Shield...then this game will seem very lame and silly to you. The missions are uninspired, recycled garbage. The game engine, graphics and the game AI are HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! It is no fun when you are trying to shoot enemy troops and your soldiers just walk right in front of you and stop or just ignore the troops shooting at them from 3 feet away or when they constantly shoot into a wall because an enemy soldier is hiding behind it(funny how they cannot figure out how to kill an enemy 2 feet away in the open but they can see through walls!!) Believe me when I say your squad mates will constantly get in your way and block your path !!!! At the VERY LEAST - either download a demo or borrow a copy from a friend and test drive this yourself before spending $30 or more on this garbage. NovaLogic used to make some decent games back when I had a 386 DX2 with a 210MB hard drive and Windows 3.1, and even then the game AI was so-so. NovaLogic has not changed a bit Skip this and spend your money on the games that are really going to knock your socks off.	-1
I'm really not impressed. Yeah, the graphics are good (if you have the computer to support it) but the overall fun value is very low for the single player mission.  It's just a bit too easy to kill the enemy (almost like using auto-aim).  How can one shot to the abdomen take a man down so easily?  Plus, you can't control how far grenades are thrown.  There's way too many scripted elements in the game... for instance, if you don't kill this guy first with the RPG, then you die.  If you don't kill this guy that runs around the corner, then the hostages die.  It's just too scripted and not a very customizable pre-mission setup.	-1
The Sims was a bad idea to start off with and the fact that they have draged it on says something about the publishers and the people buying it.  I buy this game, every single expansion pack and I hate them all!  This game is so boring, so trite, so unimaginative.  This game has all the makings of a very bad game.	-1
I own all the expansions except Hot Date, and this is the first in the series that is badly bugged and unstable.  In Windows 98 it drops to desktop frequently, some Sims become completely unusable as certain crashes happen at the same spot for that Sim every time.  You could lose your entire family if you have 98 and use this expansion. Under XP it doesn't crash but there are still nagging problems: - the 'superfast' clock speed, the one that pops up automatically and you cannot go to yourself, frequently stops in mid-day or mid-night for no reason. - Water leaks under toilets and tubs and cannot be cleaned up by the Sims (though the maid gets it). - The movement AI was never good, but now it's even worse than before. - Neighborhood stray pets are a nuisance, especially skunks and el bandito (racoon), though I've had fewer burglars so they may merely replace burglars. - Sims seem to need substantially more sleep than before.  I had a steady schedule for my family, and now I have lost an hour or so due to new, higher sleep requirements. If you have Windows 98 I'd pass on this expansion rather than risk losing my existing families. If you have XP I wonder whether the game adds more than it subtracts in problems.  The pets are okay, and the larger neighborhood is nice ...	-1
I bought this game for my 5 year old triplets.  The cursor doesn't always respond well, and is very frustrating.  The games "childrens mode" is actually more frustrating than the normal mode, as it doesn't have the hint icon.  The game occasionally plays a cartoon for up to 5 minutes that you cannot move past until it finishes, which frustrated my kids and myself to no end.  The childrens mode sometimes moves automatically, and sometimes goes to the same rooms over and over again.  The "ghost" terrifies my kids.  We all strongly dislike this game, very very frustrating on all levels.  A total waste of $40.	-1
I was very disappointed in this game.  It looked like a fun game where you walk around in a mirror, look for keys solve puzzles and maybe use magic but no.  Instead there's a little hand on the screen that you move around.  All you do is click on stuff.  I thought you would control mickey.  I mean who the heck thought of the stupid hand clicking.  This is not how the game should have been.  Every time you do something it shows like a 2 minute movie.  DONT BUY THIS GAME.  Save your money for good games like smash bros,  Resident evil series, mario sunshine, something good.	-1
Seansp, time out... kids won't like that word, you got to be kidding me. Anyway anyone who says this game is for children and bought and were not happy,is obvius we are talking about Mickey Mouse Game not resident evil... so if you don't like silly, stupid, easy games don't buy this one.... PROXIMO!	-1
The only thing good about this game is the Texans and the Seahawks new uniforms. Donavan McNabb couldn't complete a pass against the COWBOYS! So embarrasing. There are better things like night games in seasons or the hand warmer, but I'd rather waste my 50 bucks on a Seahawks game. It is pretty much impossible!!!!! DO NOT BUY NFL FEVER 2003!!! STICK WITH NFL FEVER 2002!!!!!!!!!	-1
If you happen to own one of the new ATI cards, the game won't work. So I gave it 1 star because EA sports should have fixed an issue like this before releasing a game. My system: Pentium 4 running Windows XP with an ATI 9700 PRO. It restarts the system every time I try to run the game. I am disappointed because the game we release only a couple of days ago, and the ATI cards have been in the market for more than 3 months already, and it just doesn't run with it. I cannot comment on anything game specific. I just wanted to warn people out there with new graphic cards.	-1
You may end up receiving fake/bootleg versions from China. These are advertised as official Sony brand (Made in Japan) but I received knockoffs that say they were made by Sony (Made in China). Sent back immediately for a refund. Sad.	-1
I just got these about a month ago and they will not work at all, the playstation will not recognize them? I don't know what kind of junk they are making now because I had an old sony that worked for years? Too late to send them back now too.	-1
This will be an interesting review... I think they HP games get better as they go along... Im sure it was an ok game for its time, but im not too interested in this game at all -  ~~~~1st parts of the game = A couple cutscenes (too many!), good to catch up not-familiar journeyers to the world of HP, but don't provide a lot of information (kinda hit and miss)! ~~~~First controlled levels = Really weird... i ddnt recognize Hogwarts very well, controls are kinda clunky(maybe thats because I have played all of the newer ones? ~~~~First impression of this Hogwarts = Well, we DO know that Hogwarts only gets better as the games progress... This Hogwarts was kinda weird, but at the same time was interesting and was filled with stuff ~~~~Spells = Learning spells can be tedious, and the challenges are a pain! Doing spells in general is much too simple, but it IS geared toward younger people, so i cant complain ~~~~Unlockables = Kind of a whatever feeling, i feel like i just get them and there aren't many things to get with them (there isn't that wow factor of gaining them) ~~~~Quidditch Confessions ;) = Well.... Its pretty tacky and the surrounding environment is pretty lackluster... But the setup OF the Quidditch match itself has mostly sustained up to HP 6 (HBP) and has gotten polished, which is good! So good job on that Ea!    Final Comments - The Chamber of Secrets is not very secretive (it is quite a dull place)   Spiders aren't creepy anymore :)   Hogwarts is now a very large house with doorways to gardens and cool statues??  For its time, HP 2 was probably a great game - but nowadays technology has mostly shunned this quality and idea of a game  KEY (since we are all in a learning mood!)-------- :) = *happy face*   ;) = *wink face*	-1
What a snoozefest! Whenever a game review includes "Fun for the whole family", that is always a good warning sign. Most of these Blockbuster-movie based games are usually pretty lame but this one is actually playable; this is probably why people are gushing all over it. It does not mean that it is good, no way! Harry Potter is just a well polished, slapped together, cash-in quick game. Parents will be forced to buy it, so it will automatically generate alot of cash. It really doesn't need mine.	-1
I was a diehard Robotech fan as a kid. This game did a lot to ruin that for me.  The game itself is glitchy; for example, when a character talks their picture appears on the bottom third of the screen with the text of what they said. Sometimes this stays there, blocking out both the text and audio of future messages (which sometime contain mission objectives and, yes, you fail the mission if you do't complete them in a timely manner, even if you never got the darn message) as well as a good portion of the gameplay screen.  One of the great things about the show were the massive battles with dozens of fighters from each side in a free-for-all. In the game it's usually you versus the world, with maybe one or two allies (but only sometimes, if you're lucky), and you're usually stuck defending a helpless transport that has no sort of evasive AI and will usually fly smack into the middle of an enemy formation even when there are a dozen other less-suicidal routes to take.  There are also invisible boundaries and ceilings in most of the levels, and if you hit them while in fighter mode you will come to a screeching halt and automatically go to humanoid mode - a bad prospect when you are being pursued by half a dozen enemies, which is more times than not the case. These boundaries sometimes occur in places that don't make any sense - like in a valley linking two playable areas.  As for the non-gameplay elements, the original English voice actors were brought back, which is nice, but they also voice characters just like those that they played. This leads to several confusing audio exchanges where two supposedly unique characters have the same exact voice.  I went into this game with high expectations, and it ended up being one of, if not the, worst games I've ever played. Now when I see it for sale in the discount rack for under three bucks, I know exactly why.	-1
MGS 2 was a really good game, but not as deep as the first one on the PSX.  MGS Substance is basically the japanese release of the game (american version didn't have all the extras!!).  You can skate, play as new characters, watch the movies with different characters, and more VR type missions.  I am sure those things add some replay value to the game, but other than that, there is nothing new going on.  Story is exactly the same, graphics are same, control and sound are carbon copy of original MGS 2.  If you haven't played or owned MGS 2, then substance is the one to get.	-1
I really like Splinter Cell.  MGS2 is no Splinter Cell... not even close!  The one main problem is the horrible camera angles. Just let me play in 1st person mode!  Next, why in the world doesn't Snake have a knife? If I had just put a terrorist to sleep, knowing he'd wake up again in a few minutes, I'd just slit his throat! At the very least, toss him overboard, toss his weapons overboard, or something!!! And why can't I pick up their weapons?  Also, what's with the stupid shaking the body to find stuff? Why can't Snake just go through the pockets, instead of having to shake the body repeatedly, to try and find something? And wouldn't this wake them up if they're asleep???  Dumb doesn't even begin to describe the contrived story line and limitations.  Wasted 3 hours on it, trying to see if it would "grow on me". Yeah, it grew... like fungus.  I'm not sure why I'm even giving it 2 stars, but I'm in a generous mood.	-1
"Metal Gear Solid 2 is more sneaky than Splinter Cell! Splinter Cell is just about the graphics! In Metal Gear Solid 2, you get to sit through three hours of cutscenes and try to comprehend the screwed up storyline they throw in your face! When you get to play, you'll see how short the game really is, how idiotic the bosses are, and how better it is than Splinter Cell!" This is what I usually hear from people who don't like Splinter Cell. This could have been a good game if they didn't try to make a movie out of it, but sadly, that's exactly what they did. The storyline is terrible. The conversations you have to listen to are sappy and boring. There didn't really need to be a character change in the game. You switch from Solid Snake to Raven(Why?). I would be better off playing as Solid Snake, but you have to switch for some reason. You fight most of the bosses in the 2nd portion while playing as Raven, and the bosses are pathetic. There's a Storm-like boss with a big lightning gun, a vampire with swords who happens to be in love with the boss with the lightning gun, a fat bomb carrying boss, and a boss who reminds me of Dr. Octopus. There is a corny plot for each of them, and I don't want to sit through them again because they're so stupid. The game's plot gets more bizzare as it goes on. I'm not going to expain what they are because it's too much. The last thing I'm going to say is: Splinter Cell is 10 times better. The graphics are good, the storyline is more realistic, and it actually feels like a stealth game. I get mad when people yell at me for not liking Metal Gear Solid 2. I read that even the guy who owns Konami thinks Metal Gear Solid 2 is stupid and that the original is better, which is probably true. Go cry now, MSG2 fans.	-1
Rent this game to test it before purchasing. It is very different from similar games (Halo, Splinter Cell, etc).  Although I like those other games, I did not like Metal Gear Solid. In short, it has VERY long movie scenes (I think I had to watch about 20 minutes of video before playing, and the game is constantly pausing to show you other short movies). You feel more out of control of the player than you do in other shooting games (Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Halo, etc).  The result of the movies and the awkward control is that you don't feel engaged as a player. After about a half-day I gave up on this one and returned it. If you like to get caught up in the "plot" of a shooter videogame, and the action is just an aside, then this is probably a good selection.  If you prefer action, and like the plot as a nice backdrop, then you are not likely to enjoy this game.	-1
A number of reviews have already mentioned the worst thing about this game: the obscenely long cut-scenes. I started to time one of the longer ones, but after 30 minutes I couldn't take it anymore! The cut-scenes add little to the game play. Mostly they're gushy emotional diatribes that have some sort of message like "give peace a chance" or "all you need is love" or "don't poop in the tub." The weaponry in this game was pretty exciting - but you never really USED IT! Despite having guided missles, automatic assault weapons, and grenade launchers - you spend most of the game with a tranquilizer dart, sneaking around. (In fact, I didn't use the grenade launcher once the whole game!) Finally, the story-line is about as convoluted as it gets. By the end of the game, I really don't know what's been going on. With so many "twist-turns" they turn a straight-forward game on its head. Save your money. This game is too preachy, and lacks exciting gameplay. ...	-1
I went to my friends house to see what this game was all about.  Well we started with such excitment but yet, I grew board of this game really fast.  He ended up beating the SOL story in 2 days, and I hardly played any of it.  He got board of it too, cuz he had SOL as well.  Well here's the deal Gameplay:Well the same except on the Xbox you have to hit the left anolog stick to get out of 1st person view, and that makes you not wan't  to get your cover blown, and the game suffers from slowdown, which really ticked me off. Graphics:Whoever said that this took advantage of the Xbox graphics is lyin.  There nearly the same as the PS2's or a slight bit worse, but anyway, they look kinda the same.  So not much canged here. Sound:Well yea the sound is a bit better than the PS2's, and that so far is the first advantage the Xbox had over the PS2 Value:Well if you are a fan of metal gear and have every single game, like me, then you pretty much have this game.  The VR and alternate missions:You can just pop in MGS VR missions and there u go; Snake tales:They were intruiging at first, but they are very dissapointing once you're done; SOL if you have SOL for the PS2, then it's pretty much the same old game, just a diffrent system, unless you wanted to play as Snake very badly, but I don't give a ... Overall:This game is very dissapointing to me and my friend.  This will not even be as nearly praised as MGS2.  This is baisicly a port of MGS2.  I was expecting another great port like Max Payne, but got Resident Evil's directors cut.  Anyone with a PS2 and has MGS2, and thought that substance was the reason to buy an Xbox, belive me you rather wait till it comes out for the PS2, unless that'll be a letdown as well.  If you have both systems with MGS2, I'd rather wait for Splinter Cell, DOA Xtreeme Volyball or Halo 2 than buy this if I were u.  My friend wanted to sell it, so I got someone for him that brought it.  If u have only a Xbox, then u jes might get this game.	-1
If you buy this game please be warned that it is very bad. If you think this game will offer you the action packed thrills of GTA or anything along that line please reconsider.  I play a lot of games and I know video games.	-1
I enjoyed the Simcity games and felt ripped off with Simcity 3000 as it was basically the same package as the previous Simcity.  If you love the basic city building concepts of the Simcity games, Simcity 4 is the exact same thing.  At least they changed the graphics for this one and gave it an updated look for today's video cards but if you look at screenshots for Simcity 4 you'll see that it has the same rules, building types, etc.  If you'd like to play Simcity again with an updated graphics engine, go for this title, but if you've been "simcitied out," save your money and buy another title.  Sims anything sells like hotcakes and EA realizes this.  It's another attempt to cash in on the Sim name.	-1
so i ordered this and everyone who know this is a game well in mine i got a movie called yugioh the movie i have contacted amazon to help me get the game but i was really wanting to play this game again :'(	-1
This game was released about 2003 and developed over the 5 years prior to that. It also is completely unsupported by its "owners" EA (which bought it from Maxis)and has been for pushing a decade (it is a "cash cow" only). It is out of it's element on todays machines. The game is single-threaded and has its own scheduler. It is not well-adapted to a multitasking environment. It also can be rather snarky in getting along with some graphics cards. This means it has some real quirks and issues such as occasional failures to save, or lost cities, or "crash to desktop" (CTD's). On the other hand these can be countered by frequent saves and backups along with certain "habits" in the play methodology. If one does this, this game has some real appeal to many people.  The game was released as a core game, Simcity 4 (SC4) and an expansion, Rush Hour (RH) which in combination was dubbed "Simcity 4 Deluxe" SC4D. The Rushhour expansion used to be available seperately, but is quite scarce and/ or very expensive now&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SimCity-4-Rush-Hour-Expansion-Pack/dp/B00009V3NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SimCity 4: Rush Hour Expansion Pack</a>.  This particular release is only SC4 and frankly is essentially unusable by itself as much of the elements of the game, and much of the expanded customizable hooks, especially the "networks" part.. that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics, allowing a wide array of "transportation" simulations. To be really useful you MUST (IMO) have the FULL set available in several forms (see below). My low rating is for THIS VERSION ONLY. I really quite like the game itself in its full, properly-registered form.  There also is a very active community, especially in the USA, Germany and Japan and lessor followings in many other countries. This group is very community oriented and supportive. Maxis was clever to embed into the game "stubs" which support a wide array of end user customization content, and this community generates active interest which carries the game well beyond its years. This group congregates on a half dozen or so "support sites" (all free) which are accessable by all. I'd estimate there are probably about a half million fairly active players worldwide.  The game is not played versus other players (other than in comparing accomplishments or progress or sharing custom content). It is a "strategy" game based on figuring out the operation and biases of the game and designing your city designs to best overcome and conform to these needs. There isn't "an answer" but rather a broad array of approaches that work to varying degrees based on what you are trying to achieve (dense ghettos, idylic contryside, sleepy towns, etc) A single "regional development" can easily take weeks to months of off and on attention to work through these issues. If these kinds of things appeal to you, this may be the game for you, just not in this version.  The game uses a copy protection scheme that requires the CD to be in the machine to play (or in the downloadable Amazon or Steam versions a running "game support" program that validates the game) Some folk are rather put off by this.  In summary, though this is still the core of the game, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. buy the full set.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0000C0YW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition</a>&nbsp;or the downloadable version&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition-Download/dp/B00457VJ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download</a>] (also available via Steam) or as a subset of a box set with other games included&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-SimCity-Box/dp/B0014468XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The SimCity Box</a>&nbsp;I have heard there are support problems with the patches on the box set, but don't  have personal experience with it. The downloadable versions should be "pre-patched".  Be VERY CAUTIOUS buying a used version from eBay, etc as you MUST have the registration membership in the EA/Maxis web site to update the game with it's patches.. only buy if you can get this membership with its User Name and Password included or certification that the serial number has never been registered... many people have been burned on this matter Even buying "new" versions is risky as many are just pirate copies of the game and the registration number will report "already in use" even though you "bought it" as "new". Get the seller to guarantee the version is register-able  Sorry to be so long-winded, but I felt most of this needed to be touched upon. In whatever form you buy it, I recommend immediately taking a look at web sites which have active communities interested in the game. You can happily invest many hundreds of interesting hours in the game if you're willing to invest the time.	-1
I see why pictures of this game can't be found. KONAMI ruins yet another franchise of Yu-Gi-Oh.  I got this for Christmas but the buyer used amazon.  This game is like a combo of dungeon dice, chess and the digital world where Yu-Gi and the gang faced Noah. There is no voice and all you hear is music from a cheaply made porno film from the 80s. This game is a joke and should never be called a Yu-Gi-Oh.	-1
I had waited quite some time to play this game since it had been quite pricey, and yes I made a good decision to pick it up in thebargain bin. Th graphics and sound are stupendous, however it is basically impossible to make money. One keeps losing money all the time and I find it to be way to hard. The previous versions had all been improvements of prior versions of the game. To me this was a visual improvment but at the same time the gameplay suffered a major blow. I was so disapointed after having played if for a few hours and then making the drastic decison never to play it again...	-1
This is a game where you need a lot of time and thinking to suceed in. I have tried evrything to get money nohting works. I cheated constantly to build up my city till I could get enough out of my citizens taxes, had casinos, toxic waste sites ect. even only had 1 school and hospital for the entire city and made tons of deals with my neighbours. BUT STILL im losing money!!! I don't get it! But a good way of making money is doing different things on different neighbourhoods. Like a residetial 1 connected to a commerial 1 and thats connected to an industial 1. Swap deals get money, the folks jobs aren't far away and everyone's happy. Sort of. The residential lot is the hardest obviously. You need hospitals, schools, libarys, police and firestations, parks and so on.. The easiest 1 I think is commercial. Get a couple of landmarks make sure you have lots of big roads connecting to the residential and industrial lots and hey presto a massive commercial buissnes boom with tons of money. Its a good game but if it was that little bit easier in the budgets especially it would be worth playing that little bit longer.  I wiped it off my system cause it took alot of memory of my computer. Now its being lent to my cuzin, and im playing the sims 2 which has a bit of simcity in it which is quite cool. If you had Simcity 4 and The Sims 2 both installed on your pc you can make your own neighbourhood in the sims 2 but both installed at the same time would just be toooo much for my old computer!	-1
Please listen to me and realize that this was a very dissapointing game.  What went wrong I don't know.  EA "Challenged" their reputation making this game, cause it freaking sucks. Pros: - Graphics (Everything is more lifelike and seems almost that you can zoom in further than the other SimCity/s) - Terrain Builder (You can build mountains, hills, or make valleys and lakes) - Airport (This airport actually brings in people to your city and is no longer a zone.  It is pre-made) Cons: - Difficulty (Certainly not for the younger crowd) - Budget (I'm having a lot of trouble keeping money... no matter what- I have like three toxic waste dumps and a naval base missile tester and still my monthly income is negative.  I've raised my taxes and lowered matinence and buses and everything- nothing works.  MAJOR FLAW!) - Zoning (The zoning puts in streets that don't line up with other streets and if you delete you wast money because it's part of the zone.) - Overrated (look at the front of this game.  Never will you see buildings like that- trust me.  I never see blimps or helicopters.) Overall- 2/10 (I like the terrain builder a lot... but that's the only thing better than SimCity3000). Final Word- I was terribly dissapointed with this game.  SimCity3000 is just so much better.  Get it, and save some $. Have Fun w/ SimCity300, cause you WILL not have much fun with this.	-1
This game wasn't good at all! Maybe if it wouldn't crash so much I would have loved it. Did they put it out too early or something? This game truly isn't good. OR fun. Okay, I play the regular sims like HD(hotdate) and SS(superstar) and so on, and maybe I'm just comparing them. But I didn't like Simcity 4. I thought it would be great. And my mom and dad wasted $50.00 on this stupid game! And we couldn't get a refund! What a waste of money. I wouldn't risk buying this game! It kept freezing!! And I got bored with it right when we just got the game. So, you'll get bored easily. Very easily. boring!	-1
This game is definitely one of the most frustrating games currently out for the PC.  First of all, you need a very, very powerful computer to even be able to play it.  (I have a Pentium 4 computer with 1,024 RAM and a very nice graphic card and I still got a lot of slowdown) This game is definetely for either, A. die-hard strategists who love complicated games that involve you knowing how to attract people to your city, keeping the taxes low, keeping the people happy, having enough jobs etc., all at the same time.  Very difficult to do when you have your advisors screaming repetitive information back at you. The music is something in it's own.  It has a wonderful feature that you can access.  That feature is the ability to turn the music off.  The music has been repeated through every Sim City and will most likely be in the next one as well.  At least they were smart enough to include the ability to shut off the sound. One last closing note,....You know those wonderful pictures of that city with huge skyscrapers on the back of the box and the front as well?  Well, good luck getting your city to look like that without cheats.	-1
I've loved every simcity game since the first and, in theory, I love this one as well.  The graphics are rich and vibrant and the level of complexity is awesome.  Now for the down sides.... The game crashes mind numbingly awesome.  My machine screams with ever game I've played, including massive strategy games, but playing this you would think my P4 was a comedore 64.  The game just keeps going down.  As for playability, it seems excellent, if only the game stayed up long enough to really enjoy a full game. This really needed a few more months of Beta.	-1
Firstly, I have the PC version. The PS2 bit on the description has thrown me a bit! That aside, I loved Simcity 3000. Played it for hours. Heard about SC4, got it, unwrapped it.... and..... Well it looks nice. Has a bundle of extras that 3000 didn't have. So I dived in to the rich graphics and started building my city. CRASH. Frozen computer. Hmm. The read-me's said ensure you have the latest drivers for your soundcards, graphics cards etc... so off I went... spent about 3 weeks upgrading drivers, playing the game for a bit... watching it crash, trying another driver.... watching it crash... So I contacted the admitedly very responsive EA tech support via email. We spent about a week trying different things to a point where it worked ok in VERY slow software mode. At this point EA told me how I could get a refund. Not impressed. All my computer specs exceed those printed on the case. I'm also a bit of a PC geek, so following the read-me instructions, tech support advice and upgrading drivers wasn't a problem. So why am I left with a very nice looking but unstable game? I have now got it working with medium detail settings rather than the full glory I should be able to see, but after several weeks of constant crashing, I can't face playing it again. I fear the next crash! (Yes, I have tried EA's first issued patch for SC4. No it doesn't help).	-1
This game sucks! I played it with my dad about 2 years ago and we had to sit through the flippin tutorial for like 5 hours!!! We quit after a half an hour and we never played it again. The main problems are:  1. It's nothing like yugioh  2. You have to sit through the tutorial for 48 hours  3. The controls don't make any sense  4. It's more like dungeon dice monsters  Don't buy this at all	-1
Prepare yourself for this game. It's not what you think. I had read all the ballyhoo about it and it was perhaps my heightened expectations that ultimately let me down when I first started playing it. First of all, it's pretty much the same game. The core values are the same, the way it works is the same; not much has changed from 3000 to SC4. Yes it's prettier graphically ... I like to equate it to the changeover from Windows 3.1 to 95 -- but only on a visual level. The add-on functions of SC4 are pretty slim. The game playing changes unnoticeable. One of the "changes" is the importation of your SIMS from The SIMS. Before I purchased this game I had visions of watching my imported SIMS walk into stores (like in Hot Date) in SC4 and see them go about their daily lives, but on a much bigger scale -- a whole growing city. Be warned, this is not the case at all. You import your SIMS, they live in a neighborhood and then proceed to bug the hell out of you about various things they're thinking. Import one and he's a chatterbox. Import the six they offer and it's a veritable zoo. You know how annoying pop-up ads are on the Internet? Think that. It's about the same. Don't even think about installing pipes in your city. They'll spring a leak every two seconds (even if you have water utilities fully funded) and destroy surrounding neighborhood housing. Fully funded police stations are lazy. You have to direct them to the crimes and have them pick up the criminals. There's no patrolling with these boys. Drop funding a tiny bit for the firestations and they're out protesting with picket signs. It's cute for the first five minutes. It seems that Maxis has forgotten what was attractive about its games in the first place and is now only after a buck. This trend started with the runaway smash hit that was The Sims and followed with (what? we're up to six?) upgrade packages -- all providing extras that should have been in their initial game in the first place -- or at the very least combined into one extra service package upgrade ... six is tantamount to exploitation of its consumer's wallets. The same goes with SC4. While it is prettier visually, it's not the blowout wunderkind game you're expecting. Get it only if you're a HUGE fan of SimCity, or if you've never played SimCity before ... otherwise, it'll likely let you down the same way it did with me.	-1
Really looked forward to this version based on a number of previews; graphics and city details definitely improved over SC3K.....but there's a cost to pay.  Even with a computer running at 1.1GB w/128MB RAM, NVidia GEForce2 32 MB video card and most of the neat graphics features turned down/off, the gameplay becomes slow and erratic as your city develops.  Just read a review where the same problem appears in a 2.2 GB system w/ 512MB RAM.  If you're thinking of buying, wait and see what EA can do to fix this problem.	-1
If you are going to go out and buy a yu gi oh game, this sohlud be the last one on your list. It is terrible, bad storyline, dueling system is horrible, and you'll get tired of it after 10 minutes. Yu gi oh Forbidden memories, on the other hand, never gets old. You will enjoy that game much more than this one.	-1
First off, I have to say the game it's self is great. All of the new features are great, the graphics are supurb, and the realism is unbelievable! However, one possibly fatal drawback to this game is that it's already notorious for bugs. This is easily one of the least stable games I've ever played. And check out any Sim City 4 forum, I'm definitely not alone. Even with a fast system (mine is a 2.4Ghz P4, 1024MB DDR ram, 128mb ATI video card), and even after doing all of the defrags and disk clean ups that the game recomends, the game crashes, hangs, and displays glitches constantly. Turning down shadows, cars, etc can help, but what's the fun in that?? While the game and it's graphics and features are great, this is definitely another prime example of EA releasing a game before it's ready, and your game play will suffer because of it. Maybe they'll release a patch some day...	-1
Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelists of the Roses should have been great. The series is amazingly popular and the card game can be quite fun. Somehow, Konami managed to ruin a game despite the odds. First, this PS2 game takes the world of Yu-Gi-Oh! and transplants it into the middle ages, with the War of the Roses. The houses of Lancaster and York are vying for the throne of England, and only cards can settle it. OK, I don't mind that. I love English history, and I also enjoy card games. So into the tutorial we head. While they go over every step in the game, it's one gigantically long rush of about 1/2 hour or more. And instead of letting you practice the commands and repeat them, it's a slideshow-like sequence where you just keep hitting X ... X ... X. You really need a walkthrough to print out to have it all available and ignore their slideshow. Finally you get to the game. You choose a default deck and take it into "battle" as you try to move across England. Problem 1 - there's no practice! You go from that slideshow right into a nasty battle that many find difficult to win. You are often dealt awful cards that even skilled players find it hard to win with. It's hard to learn the game when your monsters are stomped easily left and right. At least you might have pretty things to look at and listen to while you die, right? Wrong! The graphics for the cards are awful. You can barely tell what element something is or anything else. Even the important numbers are hard to decipher. And for sound, you get the same droning loop of synth music again and again. Cardplay is new and unusual, with monsters moving across the board and facing each other on different terrain types. It's sort of interesting but can be extremely frustrating, especially for new players. You do get a semi-cool 3d "quick battle" when the cards meet, but even that is on a boring background and lasts maybe 5 seconds. Perhaps worth it for the incredibly-dedicated Yu-Gi-Oh! fan, but the rest of us should demand something better next time. This game is an embarassment given the quality of PS2 games coming out today.	-1
SPEARHEAD has virtually none of the game play quality which abounded in the original MEDAL OF HONOR.  The movement of the characters is very choppy, even after you cut down on detail in the "Options" menu.  This is the case even on the fastest computers (just look at the other reviews).  The historical quality of this game is the only thing it has going for it.  I have never seen the movie THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, but after playing this game, I would now like to.  Also, I did not know that the paratroopers that landed in France before D-Day were coming in under heavy fire.  I always figured they just went in quietly and for the most part, unnoticed.  (Now, I feel stupid for having thought that.)  So, the game does tend to open one's eyes to the horrors of war and what those men went through.  Actually, the primary problem I have with this game is that it's too difficult.  Now, before anyone dismisses me for a wimp, let me just say that I love difficult and challenging games.  But there are levels of difficulty in most games (this particular one included).  Usually, it's "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" - or something along those lines.  My point is, if they wanted a super-hard game to show the player how tough war is, then they very easily could have provided those difficulties on the harder levels.  For me, this game has no re-playability on even the easy level, much less the more difficult ones.  The difficulty of this game is not to be compared to other popular first-person-shooters like the Jedi series, GHOST RECON, the HALF-LIFE series, or even MEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT.  Those games and many others like them present certain difficulties, but after the player moves past the difficult part, there's time to catch one's breath a bit.  In SPEARHEAD, it's constant action with no time or opportunity to stop and enjoy the game.  I realize this is war.  But it's also a game.  In fact, it's a game first.  And these two must be carefully balanced in order for the game to be a quality product.  This game is not a quality product.	-1
The Medal of Honour that reappears in this expansion pack looks better than ever with explosive special effects and new, blow 'em away weapons. You also get to fight alongside comrades who can hold their own, which lends some authenticity to the game. Just as the first was shamelessly modelled on Saving Private Ryan, this contains scenes straight out of Band of Brothers, which is kinda fun too. Spearhead, however, is even more tightly scripted (if that is possible) than its predecessor. You can't so much as shoot out of turn if you want to complete your objectives. Annoyingly, a lot of it also takes place in the dark or in murky landscapes. In tandem with this, it reintroduces some of the most irritating aspects of the last game, such as snipers who are invisible in the gloom and at least one finicky finale in which you have to constantly save just to make it through the scene. Lastly, it does not include enough of the things that made the last one fun, such as rooms full of enemy to shoot at. Oh, and as others have noted here, it is very short -- too short to be worth 20 bucks. I got through it in a couple of hours without hurrying and have no inclination to play it again.	-1
Oh God, how I hate this game! What's most important in this game: the combos you have to make and it NEVER works!!!?? Maybe it's because I'm left-handed and I do not have enough control, power and speed in my right hand (fingers), but I suspect it has to do with Gamecube's controller with this particular game.  (The Gamecube controller I actually like very much, there isn't a single game that gives me problems for being a left-handed gamer, the c-stick for instance, an annoyance for many people,  I handle pretty well) This game did ruin my good mood completely. Not only do you have to push the right combinations, but it also has to be done in a certain fashion: rhythm and timing must be 100 percent accurate or else you fail and fail over and over again. Good lord, what a terrible waste of time this game is.  Well obviously it isn't any fun for me, but I can imagine that with a different controller (PS II or XBox) it'll be more comfortable. Still, any game that depends heavily (not to say completely on swift and acrobatic fingerworks suck big time!	-1
Ever since 1993, (10 years now) Midways been spitting these games out.  Theyre decent fighting games, plagued with mindless, unneeded blood and gore.  While there are many gory games out there, at least their gore makes some kind of sence.  As for this game, it makes no sence at all.  When you punch your friend in the arm blood does not go squirting in all directions does it?  A mediocre fighting title that tries to be orignal by adding blood and gore.	-1
In this game you play as charaters from monsters INC.,and you throw balls at each other,so what?Dont get it.	-1
Grandia Xtreme is the black sheep of the series. It shares a battle system with the other Grandia games, but little else. It's primarily a dungeon crawler. You spend most of your time slogging up and down a few relatively boring dungeons and have very little world exploration or character interaction compared to the first 2 games.  It's story and characters are so uninteresting, that I can't remember a single character or location name. Whereas I can still remember most of the characters and places in the first Grandia game, even though I haven't played it since the year after it was released (years before I played Grandia Xtreme).  If you want a mindless, fairly easy dungeon crawler, or you just want another game with the Grandia battle system, then this is your game. But most likely, you're better off looking elsewhere. Had it been the first Grandia game made instead of the 3rd, it might have gotten better ratings.	-1
This game may have more songs than its Japanese cousin but that does not mean it is better. It's completely neutered from the Japanese version instead it plays catch up with the Japanese versions. This would eventually set the stone to how American DDR versions play catch up to Japanese home versions. Yes, this version has 71 songs over the Japanese version's 44. The vast majority of the songs here HAVE ALREADY APPEARED in Japanese versions so we find this game complete and utterly useless. Yes, for every one unique licensed song this game has, there are about a dozen more found in Japanese versions.	-1
This game is pretty bad, I used to be an MK fan until they released this garbage. Technically it's decent but it has no personality and the combo/fighting system is awkward. I actually rather play MK4 instead of this because at least that game had the spirit of the earlier games.  3D fighters have left this series in the dust, I much rather play Dead or Alive... any of them.	-1
this game is so horrible. the graphics are bad, the fighters are boring, and i think this game doesn't have fatalities!	-1
Visually Mortal Kombat: DA is one of the best looking fighting games I have seen on any console, only falling in a close second behind Dead of Alive 3 on the XBOX.  The only thing I did not like about the graphics are some of the characters.  They are WAY WAY out of proportion and look very unrealistic, This is very noticable in the women characters. One good thing is this game is that the menus in the game are spectacular; the game starts in a hallway and depending on what game mode you choose the screen pans as you are walking down the hall into different rooms. The sound in the game is pretty good but nothing spectacular.  Here is where the game starts to go downhill. First of all Midway has changed the fighting system which is a good idea, but it needs alot more work.  Each character has 3 different fighting styles you can choose from during the match.  Each fighting style has different moves and different button combinations.  The first two fighting styles are basically two forms of martial art and the last fighting style is your character with a weapon.  While this is a good idea it makes the game very cumbersome, I am sure it would take some getting used to, so this may not bother you.  However one thing I really did not like is the actual game play and feel of the game.  To me the characters seem slow to respond to your commands and in the meantime get pummeled by his/her opponent.  Even after you perform the correct button combinations for a special move, your character seems to wait a split second to actually do the move, which can get very frustrating; especially against an opponent who only does the same "cheese" move for the entire match.  The same holds true for the "monster"(ie, GORO, MOTARO) opponent near the end of the game.  He has this move in which he sucks you towards his mouth and hits you while you're in the air.  This brings me to another point, MK:DA seems to have move cheap moves resulting in cheesy wins; especially with the weapon.  I never did enjoy the weapons aspect even when it was in MK4, and I feel that they need to be removed. Another disappointing thing is that each character now only has one fatality, which gets old pretty fast.  You would think on a powerful system like the XBOX, Midway would have been able to get in at least 3 fatalities per character, but instead they settled with one. Finally, one thing I did not enjoy about the game is having to unlock most of the characters.  You start of with 12 some totally new and some old ones that we know. But you can get the others by gaining various coins and going down to the crypt to "buy" them.  Basically for every computer player you beat during story mode you get X amount of coins.  Those coins add up and you can then go into the games "crypt" and open one of the 676 various coffins for a various amount of money.  The catch is you have no idea what is in the coffin until you actually open it.  Most of the coffins contain artwork, other coins, and some are even empty.  There are about 20 or so coffins that contain new boards and characters but they are very expensive.  For example to get Raiden, you need 3300 gold coins!  Let me put this in perspective; if you beat the game with a character you may only get at most 150 gold coins.  Most coins you get are ruby and graphite coins, which are not that valuable.  Needless to say you will be playing for a long time just to get one new character.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, if you don't mind playing the game over and over again but for me, I would rather have all characters available or at least not so expensive to get. Aside from the character situation I found this game to be quite boring.  To me it seemed rushed in my opinion, it has so many aspects to be the best fighting game on XBOX, but it has fallen short.  I was expecting at least 3 fatalities per character, but there is only one.  Also the fact that you have to "buy" new characters is kind of disappointing.  Even if there were a code to get the characters I probably still would not buy the game because it gets boring so fast. This game is not for everyone and my suggestion is the rent this game before you buy it.  Which is what I did.	-1
In the long history of PC games there haven't been many James Bond-brand releases on the PC; in fact, I can't name any offhand (aside from maybe James Bond Jr.). The brand has had a fruitful experience for the consoles, including the famous release of Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64. With the release of a new Bond adventure in 2002 publisher Electronic Arts wanted to create a big cross-platform Bond action/shooter that didn't have to rely on the new movie but still carried the name and was released at about the same time. Unfortunately they decided to bet on relatively old technology and some strange creative choices to do it (at least on the PC version), and the result became a rather uninteresting game called Nightfire. The player assumes the role of dashing MI-6 agent James Bond, 007, here to free the world from nuclear tyranny, British ex-patriots, and so on. Each of the nine missions precedes a full-motion animated cut scene that uncovers more of the general plot and details the next mission. More average-quality cut scenes are interspersed throughout the game at various points. Nightfire is a first-person shooter and shares all the nuances of that breed of game, with the same familiar style of control schema, albeit with some trademark differences. Aside from the variety of guns available, Bond can switch to a gadget inventory and select from one of those - the gadgets are primarily one-event-type items. A wristwatch serves as a laser for cutting locks, for instance, though you couldn't even use it to get the attention of a guard. The other gadget worth noting is the sunglasses, which when put on can switch between different shades of the spectrum - handy for locating hidden areas, laser traps, or through women's dresses. The downside is that you can only use it for so long as it runs on (rechargeable) battery power, not to mention the sunglasses are buggy. As stated above, there are only nine missions -- each have a variety of submissions with their own set of objectives. While the level design is adequate it pretty much pushes the limits of the engine, including multiple loads in a single level. The objectives, which update as the mission progresses, is not very helpful at telling you what needs to be done or even why. Only by going through a level, killing everything, and checking and/or destroying everything else can you really figure some of them out - unless of course it happens to be a level where there is a never-ending stream of bad guys and there is no clue as to what to do. Another problem of note is that a player can effectively win a mission by accomplishing an objective, get killed because of something else, and still lose the mission as the mission results screen is delayed while the game still runs. I actually ran into this on a particularly annoying boss level. Mere mention of the console game-style boss creatures is another bad mark. This by itself is not too annoying, but the bosses, not to mention the situations you're thrust into, are painfully stupid. Speaking of painfully stupid, that would be the perfect description of the game's artificial intelligence (AI) - enough said on that. This is not to say that Nightfire has some redeeming qualities. Some of the levels require going into third-person mode, which is a fun switch. Bond can only carry around four big weapons at a time, so you will have to strategize in some situations. You can use multiple different methods in certain missions to accomplish the objective. On the very first mission, Bond can sneak his way into the castle complex through the back way or fight his way through. Nightfire includes a multiplayer mode as well. It consists of LAN or internet play, supporting up to 32 players, with three modes of play: combat training (deathmatch), team combat training (team deathmatch), and capture the flag. In team games one team assumes the role of the good guys while the other team is the bad guys - and they have different models to match. Unfortunately, multiplayer mode seems tacked on and a few of the levels are very unbalanced. Several times already I've described the Nightfire engine as being stretched to the limit. That's because the developer, Gearbox Interactive, went with the Half-Life engine to develop the game, and added in their own in-house goodies. Gearbox is no stranger to using the Half-Life engine, but to release a major title with a four year-old engine (at launch) is troublesome at best. Character models are average if not great, and the animations are about the same - though there are some specialized animations as well. The Australian secret agent is a blond Lara Croft rip-off. I'm a bit of a Bond movie traditionalist so it's hurtful to sit through a particularly hard level of Nightfire listening to some techno/new age version of a rehashed Bond theme over and over again. Oh, there is some variety, and a small bit of it is catchy, but enough is enough. The song featured in the intro sequence by the female singer Esthero (and plays in the background on the menu screens) is quite good, however. The voice acting for the various characters, including Bond, seems very uneven. James Bond 007: Nightfire is a lackluster game stuck in an old engine that probably should have gone through a bit more in the design and implementation stage. Aside from a nice opening sequence and a few "well that's kind of cool" moments in-game Nightfire should definitely have its license revoked.	-1
I think this game is great for young children but it wasn't really my thing. Although there are people out there that love it. It's too time consuming. I love to get a new game and play it nonstop for week or two but this game requires more time. So much more time.	-1
There's a reason the price of this game has dropped so quickly compared to it's console counterparts - it's a horribly sub-par conversion of what might otherwise have been a pretty decent Bond game. Nightfire is a mixture of the most infamous elements of the James Bond movies. Bond must stop a mad industrialist from nuking the world, and has several gadgets and female friends to help him accomplish this. EA takes advantage of the Bond licence, as the game features Pierce Brosnan's face as Bond, the familiar Bond theme, appearances by classic Bond villains, and other goodies. But Nightfire lacks in several areas. First, the cool driving levels found in the console versions have been dropped from the PC version, probably due to lack of space. This leaves only 9 levels, which is just too short of a Bond experience. The game also seems to require a pretty high-end system to run. I have no problems running other recent games, such as Jedi Outcast, but Nightfire still stuttered along even when I set all the graphics options to low detail (and the graphics in Nightfire don't seem that spectacular in the first place). While I said EA takes advantage of the Bond licence, this isn't always a good thing. The Bond theme appears too often and quickly gets annoying, while the voice actor for Bond overplays his part and turns Bond into the stereotypical, cliched secret agent. Actual gameplay isn't too bad, but nothing special either. The levels are mostly non-interactive, small, and take too long to load (especially the Japanese resort level, where the game has to pause and load every few rooms, completely breaking up the gameplay). Finally, the game actually copies all of its cutscenes as AVI files onto your computer during installation. What's the point of playing the game when we can just watch the cutscenes, EA? Someone should have thought this out, and encoded the cutscenes as an unlockable extra, not give players free access to them even before they've seen the first level. If you have a PS2, Gamecube, or X-Box, get Nightfire for one of those instead, and not this inferior PC port. If you don't, I can't really recommend Nightfire even to the most die-hard James Bond fans.	-1
Okay, please excuse me but I feel very sick right now. I got this game for a friend's birthday. I figured "It's another Bond game, it's gotta be good." Boy was I DEAD wrong. From the moment the gameplay started, I knew this game was not what I had bargained for. The controls were clunky and buttons were placed in bad spots and the weapons had to be cycled through rather than set to hotkey buttons; the graphics were good but not great; and the levels all had some switch you'd have to pull somewhere in the level to open one of the thousands of locked doors. Now I've got to go now because I think I'm going to puke from giving a BAD gift for a high price. Overall, I can't reccomend this version of the game to anyone. James Bond should stick to consoles if the PC ports are going to turn out like this.	-1
Well I Got the game because I thought it would have cute animals . Well If you call animals that call each other names , say you are lame , fight and just plain act rude. Then I guess this is the game for you . But I don't think small kids need to see game animals act so bratty . I would also like to know why so many of the girl animals seem so stuck up and obsessed with there looks ? I think the game was made by a guys . I also found it anoying that the store was closed so much of the time .  The game is O.K. but slow and my kids hated it . Also to the reviewer that said there 3 year old can play because the game was mostly icons . That is just not true you have to read all the time and write letters . But when you get letters back they will tell you that you are hard to under stand or you just are dumb.  If you just want to kill time then play . But becareful they might hurt your feelings .	-1
I bought this game, because if there is one thing I could expect, it was that the EA NHL series was always getting better. I was wrong this time. EA took a step back on this. PS2 revived Madden, it should have done the same for the NHL series. The commentary is [bad], the rosters, I won't even go there (shame on you), the AI; EA has promised better AI every year and I still score at will! Rosters need to be better updated for 04. The franchise mode needs to be more "Maddenized" and so do the custome teams. This year, I recomend Sega's NHL 2K3 and I never thought I would say that.	-1
I am still on the fence on this one.  I can't even call this an improvement to the series.  At least you can score unlike the 0 goals in 115 shots like 2002.  Let me start by saying this market is ripe for a decent Hockey game.  EA has yet to put it all together and deliver for PS2 (hopefully next year). Ok on to this game.....The fluid animations are for the most part gone as well as the majority of digitized faces.  In are choppy cut scenes and horribly proportioned faces with one large eye looming as they skate by (you will see).  The speed burst button and big hit button are no longer the be all end all.  Now we are actually forced to deke and poke check/hook (even though it still isn't very effective).  Nothing frustrates more than lining up the big hit and your guy launching the other way.  What the heck is that?  Players also seem to skate their own way even when you are controlling them (yes even more so now).  The create a player is basically unchanged.  Fighting is better now thank God.  No more getting laid out by Claude Lemieux. In a nutshell this is the same EA game we have seen for years with the run of the mill tweaks.  The only reason I keep playing is because EA minutely changes the game play every year and I am always hoping it is better.  Yet again not this year.  Still as [bad] as last year.  Buy if you must after all there aren't really any real hockey games out there.	-1
This game would probably be fun to little kids, but I really disliked it.  Very boring and no practice of free will.  If you're 12 or over, don't do it!	-1
This game gets quite boring after awhile. After meeting all my objectives there was nothing left to do. Interaction with the animals can be slow and frustrating. Letter writing is also slow and tedious. Good for very young children, my little niece and nephews (ages 4-7) seemed to like it.	-1
I hoped that this game was fun, seeing on all the reviews and stuff, but it's not. This game needs like this expansion, to make it more,supposedly fun, don't buy it!	-1
I put this game in my Game Cube for about ten minutes and had to remove it.  My friend came over and wanted to see why I said it was like torture to play that game and he realized it as I stared away from the screen while it was being played.  I considered snapping this game in two and flushing it down my toilet, but that might be too good for it.  This game is much worse than games that are so boring or easy that you sleep while you play through them.  It is indeed torturous because of the noises that the animals make while they talk, so that you cannot sleep through the game while you play it.  The answer to this problem is simply do not play it.  Fortunately, I bought it used and it sits in my collection, but is not played.  I bought it because so many critics gave it excellent reviews, but the critics can and quite often are wrong about games.  I may give it another chance someday, but not anytime soon.  Hey Nintendo, I have a great idea for a spin-off of this game.  The spin-off would be called The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction of Animal Crossing, in which the Hulk has to go around and smash the animals of Animal Crossing and their surroundings.  And the Hulk would have all the incentive he needs as soon as he would see and hear the annoying talking of these animals and their annoying behaviors.  Hulk smash, good Hulk.  Nintendo, at least consider a spin-off called Batman Vengeance on Animal Crossing, in which Batman uses all his Bat Weapons/Arsenal/Utilities and his stealth abilities to take vengeance on the animals of Animal Crossing.  On a positive note for Animal Crossing, it might be potentially liked by children that like to play house, but it would probably be better for children to play house the old-fashioned way with their friends.	-1
I will start by saying that my sister is an addict of this game. So is my friend, who has not only moved into town but has already payed off and made an addition to his little virtual house. I, personally, can't stand this game.  I have played this for maybe 30 minutes, and that was enough for me. Very slow paced and boring.	-1
Pac-Man has been having a really good run on the Nintendo Gamecube, really. With titles like the excellent 3D platforming adventure Pac-Man World 2 and the fun multiplayer experience that is Pac-Man Vs. under the dot-muncher's sleeves, not to mention a Namco Museum containing Arrangement games.  So why the heck did Namco allow this to be placed onto store shelves? Trust me when I say that the opening FMV video to the game was the best thing about it. Once you get that out of the way, you're thrown into a swarm of low-budget-ness, complete with Comic Sans font seen in menus and other bland screens. This includes the game itself, which is just a board game video game as a way to hop aboard the Mario Party train. Only problem: This is way worse than every Mario Party there is.  The game lets you pick one of THREE boards. Yes. Only three. Even worse, they are boards that you just race from start to finish on. I thought it'd be alright though, since a brief game could still be fun. However, they managed to make these boards DRAG. I could have sworn I was supposed to finish up my game like an hour or so prior. Instead, this is as slow as a snail's pace. There are no dice blocks. Instead, the minigames actually start at the beginning of every turn. How far you move depends on how well you ranked in the minigame. Unfortunately, the minigames suffer from feeling like being made under a low budget, and were nowhere as fun as Mario Party minigames. Everything felt so static and soulless, especially in minigames where you drive a kart or throw darts/"discs".  As a player walks across the board's spaces, there's no telling what BS could happen. There are Spring spaces (bounce player forward), Return spaces (opposite), spaces where a bunch of a player's coins could be taken away or earned easily. and Store spaces where players could spend on cheapness such as moving forward or SENDING OTHER PLAYERS BACK SPACES. Yeah, that's pretty fair, am I right?  With all that said, my first and so far only playthrough on one of the boards was dreadful. There were so many times where I couldn't land on a Store space, and I haven't even landed on a Spring space, yet the CPUs had several times. The fact that I won was nothing short of a miracle  I would have given this 2 stars, but the thing is - I never had fun with it. Even with crap games like Sonic 2006 or Rock & Roll Adventures, I've found a way to get at least a little bit of enjoyment out of them. But with this? I was rather stressed out by how luck-based many moves felt.	-1
Maybe it's just me, but I'm seriously considering the possibility that Nintendo's Animal Crossing has millions of people brainwashed.  When I read such positive reviews about such an uninspiring game, I thought of the old horror flick Halloween III.  Get the picture?  If you don't, simply watch H_3, and you'll come to understand.  Now about the game itself.  Animal Crossing was a marketing success, but a nightmare behind closed doors for those who felt definite disappointment in the overall release.  Of course the majority of those who own Animal Crossing may feel a bit different.  Those of us who were looking for something more, were surely left in the dark.  Animal Crossing COULD have been a GREAT game.  Instead, it was released with stone age graphics, very limited real life concepts and nothing to offer for the more mature gaming community.  Not all of Animal Crossing is terrible.  The real time concept was unique and impressive.  Anything else brought into the same light would be considered a joke.  Many would like to put TheSims and Animal Crossing in the same boat, but the two really can't be compared.  TheSims has endless possibilities, while Animal Crossing is extremely limited.  Two stars are given for innovation and innovation alone.  Animal Crossing could have been a game of sheer genius.  Could_a-should_a-would_a - blah.	-1
The movie was bad but the game is much much worse!!  I can't believe this is even going to be released, what an embarassment to the company!  Oh my word, I've never played such a awful game in my meaningless existence.	-1
This was a gift and I finally got around to installing it.  Or I should say tried.  I tried to run it on a laptop and 3 computers but the game will not start.  Just a black screen.  The one thing to be aware of is the fact that your monitor card has to be texture and lighting compliant.  My nvidia quardo fx 1400 from some reason will not work.  Also, note that Black Isle is dead and Vivendi has a not that they will no longer support this game.  Do not buy it.  If I ever get it running I will come back and change this review.	-1
I have played other LOTR games before, including The Hobbit for Gamecube, but I couldn't enjoy this game.   The first disadvantage is when you first start the game.  A long ctscene plays, and every two to three seconds, the screen flashes white, which causes splitting headaches for people with eye problems.   You also must use a keyboard to play, which is extremely difficult; I can't even get out of Hobbiton without falling off a bridge.  The game doesn't support gamepads (special controllers that you can plug in to your computer to play a game), and if it had, the gaming experience would be easier.   The graphics are choppy, which also tend to hurt your eyes occasionally.  Sometimes, when you're walking around, it's hard to tell where you're going as trees and such sort of flash by.   There are two advantages, however, for this game.  One is that it doesn't take as long as other PC/Mac games to install, and the other is that this game is purely based on the LOTR books, not the movies, so that you feel like you are playing the original adventure.   Overrall, get this game if you are a die-hard Tolkien fan, but keep in mind that there are more disadvantages than advantages to playing it.	-1
I only just received this game via UPS a few days ago and already I am highly disillusioned and highly tempted to put the game away or sell it to an 'action genre' (which is what this game really seems to be more of) fan and rue the loss of what might have been a truly fantastic game.  I have been a Tolkein fan since 1967 (long, long ago) and when I read the hype on this game and how it stuck to the books by Tolkein (upon which I wrote my college English lit thesis) I decided that this was an adventure game that I really wanted to have.  At the beginning of the game we find Frodo running 'helter skelter' all over the Shire doing mundane... tasks NOT found in the books.  Finally, we finish with that and head to Bywater, very short and sweet and wonder what that was all about.  We head back to Baggend to retrieve the Ring and to hand over the key to Mr. Gamgee which is the beginning of the action genre.  From that point on, I found that I, as Frodo, was totally unable to get out of the Gamgees front yard before I was 'killed' by a Black Rider (after the 7th death, I called it quits and headed here).   Secondly, we have far too many keyboard, mouse and mouse+keyboard controls and are not given any where near the time to learn all of the controls before the attacks begin and we find ourselves in need of controls that up until now haven't even been used in the game.  Unless you are really an action fan and don't mind lots of controls and have an excellent memory and extremely dexterous fingers, I would say:  leave this one on the shelf!	-1
This game is incredibly shallow and boring.  By the time they had me looking for mushrooms I turned the game off and used the disk as a frisbee.  Save your money and get Two Towers instead.	-1
i thought this would be a little like cel damage, but no it was like the worst game ever made on the worst video game system ever made, it was a nightmare. this game is so stupid, there is no real plot to the game. all you do is hit the other loons and listen to the annoying director and he tells you what to do. personally it is bad and i hope nobody makes the mistake of  buying this like i did.	-1
Reviewed on a 1GHz, PIII with ATI Rage Pro 128, 256M RAM. This is a joke, right? We're not seriously expected to pay for this program which would have been considered unimpressive five years ago. The graphics are mundane, the character movement is crude and awkward, it doesn't play full-screen (it's always in a window). The cut scenes are played by 3rd rate amateur hacks with video/audio synchronization like a dubbed martial-arts movie. The third person view constantly blocks the objects your looking for and you can't change the view to be more overhead. The graphics are so crude the program should run smoothly on a 333MHz box but its really sluggish on my 1GHz. What's it doing with all the cpu time? Looking for extraterrestrial intelligence? If Tolkein were alive this dross wouldn't bear the name of the Lord of the Rings! I expect more from Vivendi - much more!	-1
I was one of those people who saw and loved "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring!", the classic movie. I thought the video game would be much of the same. Fun, great story, good graphics and overall just something to spend time playing. Well, I was wrong. This game is nothing like the movie, and in my opinion was a very over-hyped game. "Why?" 1. The gameplay: It's just boring. You start off spending an hour in the Shire, trying to do various tasks, which are rewarded very lightly. For example, you have to give the lady who's buying your house a letter, which takes 15 minutes to find (usually more). There is no map of the Shire, no hints of what to do. Everything has to be figured out by yourself. So after you find the little paper or letter, you walk back to give it to her. But nooooooooo wait, you have to find another item without any help and ring a bell because she believe there are "Wolves" in the shire. That's another 15 minutes if your lucky, 30-45 minutes if your not. You also have to complete close to a dozen tasks to get your "Corruption" rating up. If you become to corrupted (it's a second bar above your health), you just die. I had to start over several times because of that. So say that somehow you do get all this done, get stocked with supplies, talk to everyone, and are ready to go in less than 2 hours, you must escape the black riders. I did this, and it is extremely difficult, and yet in parts so easy it's stupid. There is always a certain area you can go where the black riders can't get u. And yet at the end, u must make a run for it. No where to go, no where to hide. And the black rider you must at the end escape from, is on a horse. Well, if you get past all that in 3 hours, without dieing, your lucky. Most people don't. And the whole process is just boring. No excitement, no real rewards. I hated the first part. Well, once your out of the Shire, you head into a forest. The forest is full of creatures, which are all so easy to kill. You must find your 3 companions who came with u, who somehow get lost in 4 different parts of the forest. This alone took another hour, and if your not lucky, you'll get lost forever (literally). Once past that, you are caught by a willow tree, when u are suddenly saved by a fat, short man named "Tom Bambaldi" or something like that. You must then find 15 lilies, which takes another 30 minutes. At this point, I had died 5 times, had not found anything I liked, was bored, and was just sick of the repetitiveness of the game. That was my wonderful experience playing this game (luckily I rented, and returned the next day). Graphics: This would get probably 4 stars. The graphics are pretty goood, but are PS2 graphics. It wasn't what it could have been. For example: The black riders are in total 3D, and look really cool. But their capes for some reason are flat and are in 2D. Very dumb. You can't go in the water, which once again, looks very bad. The leaves you can quote "Run through" you can only run through once. And they are very rare, only a few for each part of the level. But in many aspects, the game was good. You can break many things, and that's always fun as they fully destruct. The Shire is brought to life well, and in many ways, this game was fun to look at. But with the horrible gameplay, this game could not be saved. 3. Sound / Lasting Appeal: Well, the voice acting was fantastic, and the one point where this game was 5 stars. It was always fun to listen to people talk, and the cut scenes are very well done. Unfortunantly, this was the only fun part of the game. As for the lasting appeal, none. It takes 5 hours just to get a chapter into the story, and the whole thing, I'm afraid, just bored me. If you think you can stand all this, then this is the game for u. Persounally, I think a game should start out easy and become challenging later on, and let u do something cool and interesting within the first hour. Some may like this game, but I sure didn't. Over-hyped, and over-bought, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the XBOX, PS2, and PC was a disapointment in my mind. Hope this helped, and I prevented those who would have hated this game from making a VERY tragic decision. Thx!	-1
Yeah...well don't get on here expecting a board walk,used to winning,but not on this one,I feel like I have to hit the pit more often then the computer,even when I hit the pit at the same time as the computer,BS STRIKES,my car is running short on gas,GO FIGURE when I'm rarely in first place!!	-1
Don't buy Thunder.  It's not a bad game, just that you can better spend your money on NASCAR HEAT: Dirt to Daytona.  Thunder only offers stock car racing whereas Heat offers *4* games in 1: Dirt/Go-Kart(modifieds)/Truck/Car and therefore Heat offers a lot more variety and fun.  Buy NASCAR HEAT: Dirt to Daytona instead.	-1
Please save your money and do not buy this game. If you want a good LOTR game buy the two towers for any platform. First off I had problems with sound (I have sb live plat 5.1) so if it doesn't work well for sound blaster what does it work well for. The graphics are okay, but being as how the gameplay is LAME and the quests you get are lame.. do not buy this. They took a good story and went off in the wrong direction. I ended up returning this after giving it a decent chance (even with the sound problems)	-1
I'll try to be nice and start with the good: There are parts of this game, visually, that are beautiful. I played it to the end just for that aspect alone. The graphics in all modes, whether you're playing as FP, 3rdP or watching a cut scene, are very nice...really beautiful. Moria was my favorite; the Balrog and Gandalf's fall into Shadow was cool. In many ways, it's true to LOTR books and a nice way to learn the basic story if you can't/won't read the books. Also, there are parts of the books that you don't get in the movies. Tom Bombadil (as annoying as he may be) and Narzil reforged being the biggest points. One quirky thing...in the cut scenes, the characters look much different than the characters when you're playing them...which is odd. I found it funny that in the cutscenes, the Hobbits have curly hair (as Hobbits do), but in the game, they all have staight hair...in fact, everyone who has hair has straight hair. Here are the major downfalls...some of which are maddening: The gameplay is shamefully bad! Did no one test this game? Shame on them! First, you can't fight in FP mode, other than to use your alternative weapon (rock, bow, magick). So, you're forced to fight in 3rdP mode and suddenly the 'camera' angle goes haywire! You can't see who or what you're fighting or suddenly there's a tree or a wall in your way. This is inexcusable IMHO. Also, you can't choose which character you can play and there's no changing the difficulty. You can't venture very far and just look around either = no replay value! Add on that the characters all move like they're Cave Trolls on smack, and you've got a recipe for disaster. No skill really required...you keep pounding away at your mouse. Not so much fun or good for the hardware. If that's not enough, I found the game to be rather buggy. Once in Moria Gandalf was stuck in a wall...I couldn't move and had to start over. It crashed my system many times and I have a 'stout-hearted' system that even Samwise the Brave would admire. Also, there are times when you really don't have to fight anyone at all to pass the level. This is especially 'helpful' when you're Frodo since he can't do much of anything. If you just run to the end, picking up Mushrooms, Cram and Lembas as you go, you can pass to the next phase. I did this several times with Frodo with the ghosts (Paths of the Dead?), the Orcs in Moria and the Urku-Hai just before the end. Why bother playing at all? And what about the Ring, which I think I used once just to put the darn thing on a see what happens! Who cares about gaining purity when you don't have to use the Ring?? The 'puzzles' were laughably easy and the game was so short, I was angry that I'd actually paid for this bundle of [junk]. It's a total ripoff that completely takes advantage of the new generation of Tolkien fans that the movies have created. Obviously, Peter Jackson had nothing to do with the game. I've played more engaging games on a Commodore 64! Bottom line: Save your money...Tolkien Enterprises doesn't need it.	-1
It looks like lots of lord of the rings stuffs are coming out and here we have a game. It looks real cool on the outside but inside is a different dimension.   The biggest problem of the game is that this game has no main dish. What it means is that it's kind of hard to tell what this game's real genre is.   It's looks like action(beating up monsters) but there aren't any real attack combos or sword tricks or any intense moves. And the other one is that battles and sword fights are just too simple. When you meet some scary looking monsters on your way you just place your character facing that monster and just keep clicking the mouse with not much thinking until that monster hits it's face one the ground.   And there are simple range attacks so if you have time you just need to shoot and feed those monsters with arrows while they're coming to get you and when they get close you just do that simple sword excersice I mentioned.   And there are magic attacks but most of them are not so effective so you only use one or two for battle.   And the bad camera view really adds furstration to the game(the characters keep blocking your way so it's sometimes hard to see where you're going).   Oh, lost your health during the last battle, then you can find some healing stuff lying around somewhere. And you can find some more after few battles later and some more after battles and some more after battles and more and more and more...............   (that means the game's not much challenging)    And it looks like an adventure game if look at it at a different angle(because of the weak action). But it just don't look like one because there ain't no challenging puzzles or path finding or anything.    And level designs, just not done with much creativity.  Finally the violence part. This game is not very violentive(ok, it's violentive sometimes) and has some blood but not very real looking(only few big blood drops goes flying in the air)   Overall, not the kind of game that makes up to it's name.   But the short movies in the game and charaters talking in games are GOOD, but gameplay is not that fun. So wait for Two Towers, it should be better.	-1
What do I say?No point, nothing fun to do(except pick weeds), and the music drives me crazy. Dont get it, not worth it. Dont even borrow it from a friend. Personally, you couldn't pay me to play this game(unless you're you willing to pay...then we'll talk)	-1
I was anxiously waiting for this game, when i played it, i didn't liked it!! It's fun i didn't like the whole thing about you protecting mario, and then he cries if the baddies get to him.  Some parts are like strategically you have to figure out what to do!, I didn't liked it, but it was someewhat fun	-1
I decided to purchase this game because my Links98 was having erratic results when I purchased a new computer with a 1.4gig processor. I hoped that the new game would respond better to mouse clicks. Well - that's the only thing I can say good about the game.  Other than that, the graphics are horrible. Making an internet connection is next to impossible. It takes over a gig of hard-drive space if you install it in its entirety, and it will not load your older LS games, even though the advertising says it will. I would only recommend this to someone I didn't like.	-1
I'm so glad I rented this game instead of buying it. Animal Crossing is cute but completely pointless. It's a little like "The Sims" in that you have a character and a house in a virtual world; but unlike "The Sims," there are no relationships, and it's not even much fun decorating the house (it's only one tiny room). I got bored after about 90 minutes; I could tell the game was going to be nothing more than running repetitive errands for the residents of the little town. I truly don't understand why anyone likes this kind of game. This is just as bad as "The Sims Online" (another boring, pointless real-time game).	-1
What happens when you find yourself trapped in a world where animals can speak? Animal Crossing is that world. Animal Crossing offers some of the most innovative game play Nintendo has to offer, but was very poorly executed. Animal Crossing is a neat, little game where you enter a town run by animals. The animals CAN speak English. Believe it or not, Nintendo actually programmed the game to phonetically sound out everything being said. This means that if you close your eyes, you can still understand the dialog, even though it has been sped up to the speed of the Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. All the animals talk like this, with various tonal differences. Ivan the Russian bear speaks with a deep voice, while the Cat (I do not remember her name) speaks in a high pitched voice. This is called Animalese. Animalese is great because of the phonetic speech, but can become quickly annoying.  There is also a silent voice, where text just appears and an option where you get the standard beep tone every time a word appears on-screen. For the duration of my play, I left it on Animalese, to see if Nintendo kept the speech  consistent through the game. Believe it or not, they did. The game has an interesting beginning. Before you see your character, you are asked questions by a cat on a train. The cat will ask you your name, which becomes the name you will be addressed by through out the game. Then you are asked what you think of your name. By answering "It is a good name", the cat assumes you are a boy. Alternatively, by answering "It is a cute name", the cat thinks you are a girl. You then receive a chance to correct the cat if he guesses your gender incorrectly because of the option you chose. Once you exit the train, a Raccoon named Tom Nook will show you to a group of four houses. These houses are possible starting points for you. Once you select a house, the Raccoon tells you that you owe him for the house. At this point, you spend most of your time paying for the house, rather than having fun. Initially, you begin paying for your house by running errands for Nook. He then sets you free to find your own way of running errands. You must pay Nook at least 1000 bells (bells is the currency) a week. If you do not like being indebt, get used to it in this game. The real fun begins, once Tom Nook sets you loose. You have more time to explore the town. Nintendo had the foresight to employ the Game Cube's internal clock to have an effect on play. The game is in real time, and stuff changes even while you are not playing, though, you should not leave your Game Cube on all day and night. The townsfolk have their set schedules that they follow. Most of them stay near their houses in the night hours, but may walk the town during the day time. Even the post office changes clerks, depending on the time you are playing the game. You must also remember to not play the game too long. If you keep interacting with the townsfolk all day and all night, they will not get their much needed sleep and will tend to be very curt with you the next time you turn on your Game Cube. This can be very amusing, but upset neighbors can really impede your progress. The environments are well  portrayed. Overall, Nintendo kept a child-like feel to Animal Crossing. The graphics are simple and the environments are easy to navigate. The size of the town is rather small, so depending on your preference, this can either be a positive or a negative to the overall game. I am personally pleased with the ability to customize the inside of your house, though you spend so little time inside, that it becomes as useless as the room feature in Pokmon G/S. My only issue with the towns is when you are running errands, sometimes, you need to run from one end, to the exact opposite end of the town. This not only takes time, but can get tedious. Animal Crossing supports the Gameboy Advance E-Reader. With the E-Reader, you can add furniture and other items to your inventory. This is a neat idea. Personally, I enjoy little antics and innovations like this, but in Animal Crossing, you can even swipe the E-Reader classic games and be able to play them on your Nintendo (if you buy one from Tom Nook). The E-Reader cards are an incurred cost (as you actually have to go out an buy them), but prove to be more like the Pokmon Trading Card game, short lived. I found Animal Crossing to be a very repetitive game. You spend most of your time running errands and interacting with the townspeople. This tends to get very repetitive. If I wanted to work on my relationships with others, I would play The Sims  (PC and PS2) by Electronic Arts. As for the Gameboy Advance E-Reader interaction, I find this to be a more costly expense than it is worth. In all seriousness, who really wants to go out and spend more money on cards that they will only use for Animal Crossing, then throw away when they get rid of their Nintendo Game Cube? My largest complaint about Animal Crossing is that by the time I got a shovel, I could not use it the way I wanted. If I could have, the town's population would drop to 1, and there would be dirt mounds near each villager's house. Overall, Animal Crossing finds the same replay value as Harvest Moon. You either enjoy the repetition, or you hate it. Because of its simple nature, I can see Animal Crossing appealing to players under 12.  For more intelligent players or players who do not work in factories, I recommend staying away from this game. Needless to say, I did not like Animal Crossing.	-1
First of all, let me say that this is an amazing game in ways. It runs on a real-time clock, and the conditions change from morning to day to night. This is really nice and adds a real boost to its already high originality. This is baisically the Sims, Nintendo style. All the townsfolk are animals, and the player is a strange looking boy or girl.  Now the GC is known for the "kiddy" games, and this dosen't help it. But, I don't really care about that, so I'll skip that part.  However, the graphics are seriously sub-par for the gamecube. Somethings look nice and smooth, while the animals, and players and just about everything else are box-like and not smooth at all. However, graphics don't make or break a game.  The sound is also sub-par, but I guess it goes good with the "happy-go-lucky" aspect of the game. It is usually a cheezy piano song, or the "town song" which you can change to whatever you want. I feel the the SFX are overly used, but that's just me.  Now for the biggie, the FUN FACTOR. You've probably all heard that there are a TON of things to do, and you can't really beat the game, just keep playing. Lots of things to do sounds good, right? Not in this game. You get to town and are 18,000 "bells" in debt for your house the size of a small cubicle. I paid this off in about 1-2 hrs. Then you can make your house bigger, and get another 148,000 bells in debt. Collect shells and fruit, and you'll pay it off in no time. Then a few new options open up. You can buy a bug net and a fishing pole and a shovel. You can fish, collect bugs, and dig up fossils, and sometimes bags of money. You can either sell your captured insects and fish to the store, or donate then to the town hall. Sounds fun? Not really. Fun for an hour or two, and then catching bugs and fishing can get boring, fast. I rented this for free as a promotion from Blockbuster(thank God) instead of buying it. I'm glad. After you finally get debt-free you can collect things, find fossils, and fish and hunt bugs, and THAT'S ABOUT IT. I have only had it 4 days, and am bored stiff with it.  Rent this game, maybe twice, but don't buy it unless you have unlocked all the activites and have fun with them all. Bottom line(literally): Close, but no cigar.	-1

This was a gift for my 6yr old, one of his starter PSP 3000 games. Unfortunately, he hasn't played it much, saying it is too difficult. Even his 10yr old, video game savant, brother concurred. Guess I blew that one. The 1 start may me more of a comment on me and not the game. Balance my comments by older player's thoughts for better analysis.	-1
I was so excited to finally get this game in the mail.  I could not wait to open it and play it, but when I sat down and played it, I absolutely hated it and wound up putting it down almost instantly.  I wanted to love it, I tried my hardest to like it, I even tried to force myself to like it, but I can't do it.  First, controlling the vehicles is not too bad, the schematics are pretty good.  However the handeling of the vehicles is an absolute nightmare.  There is no middle ground, the vehicles either have a horrible handeling in which you cant turn quickly and bang into walls every 3 feet or they have too much handeling where you are swerving all over the track banging into walls every 3 feet from over compensating the controls.  And yes, I know you have to use the air brake system, but who the hell wants to use that through the whole race, I want speed not brakes and percision.  This leads me to my second point.. The tracks.  The worlds are magnificient and the graphics are absolutely awesome, however the tracks are so skinny and narrow.  Forget about the control with a good handeling vehicle, try navigating the tracks with the Pirhana who has the worst handeling, its impossible.  Secondly the tracks are so linear, straight and boring.  Big deal, you give me a turn or a jump, the least they could have done was make different routes or, i'm not asking for anything as expanseive as Midnight Club, but give me something, meet me half way, maybe to the point of Star Wars Racer Revenge, where you don't have infinite directions but there are multiple routes and forks in the tracks.  The difficulty of this game is absolutely annoying for a casual gamer like myself.  This game is meant for gamers not people who play it on the subway to pass time on the commute.  Unless you have the time to invest in this game do not bother getting it as it will make you miserable and frustrate you beyond imagination.  Game makers should make games for everyone, not just people who play video games 24 hours a day!  Even games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill have an easy or beginner mode for people like me, and a nightmare mode for real gamers!  Lastly for a game that prides itself on being about high speed crafts and such, the game is slow as anything.  Yes you get to hit like 800mph on the track, but you spend more time banging into walls racing at 0 mph and sitting in last place.  For a game that is supposed to be full of action, you see none of it, since the action for you stops if you bang into something.  Really? This is supposed to be fun?  The weapons you can get are really cool, but unfortunately the one you get the most is the shield... I DONT WANT THE SHIELD, I WANT A MISSILE!!  In essence the game is beautifully crafted, the worlds and graphics are amazing and the vehicles have very cool designs. That is why I gave it 1 additional star.  The music is a technoey mix which is pretty good too.  One additional point on the game speed... while the craft is moving 600mph, it looks like you are going 2mph, the speed factor was not done well at all, I can walk faster than the craft moves.  But please, unless you have time to invest in this game, and practice, and you have the patience of a saint, and are a graceful loser than do not buy this game, as it will anger you beyond belief.  And be ready.. the opposition always get the missiles and you get stuck with the dumb pointless shield!  For better PSP racing cames check out Midnight Club, this can get repetitive after a while, but at least you have infinte directions to go in and tons of races and cars.  For better racing games in general for PS2, check out Midnight Club 2, MC3 Dub Edition, Star Wars Racer Revenge and Twisted Metal Black (not racing but vehicular combat) is beyond awesome!  I know the little fan boys are going to tear into me, but I don't care, because someone needs to stand up for the casual gamer!	-1
It almost pains me to write this review as I am sure people will hate my review as much as I hated this game.  The Good:  absolutely beautiful game.  Good animations, great worlds.  This game is great for people who will take the hours necessary to master the racing in this game.  This game could last forever for them.  The Bad:  However, for those of us with lives that like to game from time to time for some fun times, avoid this game at all costs.  It is flipping hard.  Without hours of practice, you will slam into 3-4 walls of every race, thus insuring your defeat and frustration.  Bottom Line:  Is it fun?  If you have lots of time to master it.  I am told you will love the game once you do.  Will I keep it?  I am also told you have no life if you spend it all mastering the fine art of a VIDEO GAME.  Is it for kids?  Nope.  Too hard.	-1
Since I have always been a fan of the Need for Speed series since its inception on the 3DO system, I bought the XBOX version of this game the day it came out, I thought it would have to be better than the PS2 version, right? Wrong. Despite the obvious lack of PlayStation 2 technical capability, the PS2 version is actually much, much better. The XBOX version plays like a beta of the PS2 version. It has several mistakes I noticed right away (incorrect statistics, cars driving on the left side of the road in US locales, etc), and the bottom line is, the XBOX one isn't fast or fun and the PS2 one is. Luckily, they took back my XBOX version and gave me a PS2 version. And, BTW, only the PC version will have online play, unfortunately.	-1
...I feel robbed just renting it! This game is miserable in so many ways I don't know where to begin. As the race started, the first thing I noticed was, the frame rate is about 15-20 frames per second(the average is 30, a good-decent game is 60 frames per second. Heck, most racer games can generate 60 fps). There is NO excuse for this horrible frame rate. It looks more like pictures flashing in front of the screen! It's so choppy that I never felt like I was racing, just watching a bad cartoon. The SECOND thing I noticed was the graphics are pitiful. This game is NOT worthy to be on the XBOX(... the XBOX is capable of much more and I expect it!)...	-1
I thought this game was cool at first but after the first week it got extremley boring. Whats up with the cars driving on the wrong side of the road. The graphics are ok and the good thing is the custom soundtracks because the games soundtrack sucks. Instead of buying this one buy underground 2	-1
I don't like this game I got sick after watching my brother play the game I looked up a kid got a seizure after playing the game I don't like the glitches I do not like the levels I do not like anything about the game I wanted it to be 25 worlds 120 dragonflies short loading screens with only 5 seconds 60 FPS.

Need for Speed is the only game (or family of games) that I've played for almost ten years.  I still recall fondly the first version that came out on the original Playstation.  It was such a technical and entertaining breakthrough back then.  The present version for Gamecube is, unfortunately, quite a significant letdown.  Maybe it's because I played it after playing Burnout 3 for the Xbox, an outstanding arcade racer that packs tons of action with impressive graphics.  Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2, on the other hand, feels very lame.  The framerate is the most serious problem: even on an empty open road, the graphics can become jerky.  When you have cops on your tail and a couple other cars on the road, the framerate can drop so low that the game is almost unplayable for a second or two.  This just gives a frustrating experience.  The graphics is also lacking, compared to Gran Turismo and Burnout and other outstanding racing games.  I don't think it's a problem with Gamecube's processing power; other racing games have better graphics on the GC than Need for Speed.  It's apparently because EA uses the Need for Speed series as a cash cow, to hook long-time fans such as yours truly, and they just don't invest much in improving the game's look and feel.  Three or four years ago this game's graphics would have been acceptable, but not in today's crowded racing game marketplace.  Car physics is also annoying for an arcade game like this.  Burnout 3 has the perfect arcade, non-realistic physics which makes controlling your cars and racing so much fun and enjoyable.  Need for Speed, on the other hand, turns into a rather frustrating experience.  In short, this game sucks.	-1
Controller didn't work properly.	-1
I grew up on Spyro. Little eight year old me would come home every day and hurry upstairs so she could play her PS1 and be a dragon for a few hours until bedtime. When the PS2 came out and I saw how polished the graphics were, I was so excited! Doubly so when I began seeing commercials for a brand new Spyro game, polished graphics and all. To this day, I am still full of disappointment.  Visually and in theory this game was a great idea. The worlds are gorgeous, especially the Thieves Den. Your goal is to collect the dragonflies that Ripto has accidentally scattered through the realms via a spell backfire. These dragonflies are needed for the rite of passage for the young dragons Spyro has recently freed from the Sorceress, where they will be partnered together forever.  Oh, glitches, how do I list the ways?  - Gems from fallen enemies will disappear through the ground, causing you to not be able to collect them. - Load times are painfully long. When you go into a new level, you have to wait about three minutes before you arrive. - Even when you attack enemies with your breath abilities, it doesn't always register. - There's some sort of depth perception issue when you try to do the platform jumping mini-game in Crop Circle Country. - In one of the tunnels in Luau Island, the level will disappear, leaving you stuck in the tunnel with nowhere to go. - Bubble breath has a tendency to not work, even when you have a dragonfly cornered. - When you enter Ripto's Arena, you are given no direction as to what to do, simply thrust into battle. - I have multiple glitches in Cloud 9. - Occasionally when I try to enter a challenge portal, I get stuck in it. - Although not necessarily a bad glitch, sometimes you can jump right through a breath-gate without having aquired that breath ability, and play through the levels without a problem.  I'm sure there are several more I'm forgetting; this game is overflowing with glitches, so much that they overpower the general fun of gameplay. Honestly, though, if you can get it for a couple of bucks it's worth it just to have every Spyro game in your collection.	-1
The controller works fine.  However, I was looking to replace my original controller with another official controller of the same color.  You sure have the proper picture posted, but the controller despite having the Sony logo on it is slightly a different shade of blue.  So I gotta ask, is this really an original controller, or are you fooling customers.  Until you clarify this, I'm leaving this review up publicly for others to know.	-1
I love the Spyro series. My favorite was Spyro Year of the Dragon which was perfect. When I heard Spyro was gonna be on next gen systems I was excited! Boy...I did not espect them to butcher the series for me. For one this game was not made by Insomniac games who are responsible for making the first 3 kickass games. That was my first sign this probably wasn't gonna be as good as I want it to be. (May contain spoilers)  Story: This entire story is a plot hole. In the 2nd Spyro Ripto was the main villian and you kill him at the end. This game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns. I understand the Dragonfly plot, but Riptos return is just crazy.  Graphics: Even though the graphics looked pretty good, I found lots of graphical glitches. For one the game lags alot. Before trading my copy I had a glitch where the all the sheep in the game front leg stretched into the sky. I restarted my console, but the glitch remained. It wouldn't go away. I also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time. In the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too. Damn! Did they have any quality assurance?  Gameplay: The gameplay works the same as the first 3 games, but new firebreathing techniques are added. I found lots of trouble wuth the bubble breath. I would be chasing a dragonfly and I will clearly be hitting it with the bubblebreath, but he won't be caught. That is a huge pain in the ass later on when you have to chase them annoying things on platforms and are faster. Once again theres lag. Lagging is a huge issue in this game because it happens often and slow gameplay. theres also this funny ass glitch where you swim un the air. In the homeworld just swim to the edge of the water at the Beach world entrance. Do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water. You can go all over the place with it. This prooves they didn't test the game before releasing it. I also had trouble figuring out what to do after fighting Ripto. I got no ending or nothing, so I tried collecting everything. It was impossible. I needed one gem and it was in the Thieves den. I spent days looking for it even using Sparks to help, but it never showed up. In the dragon dojo there was a glitch that happens when you try to get the kites for the baby dragons. IIf you jump in the right spot around the kite trees, the game will make the mistake of thinking you touched the kite and give it to the baby. Removing any strategy involved with getting it the normal way.  Sound: One of the highlights of Spyro games was always the sound and music. The music wasn't too bad. Its definately not the usual Spyro formula, but it wasn't too bad. I notived alot of the music consisted of what sounds to me like Indian chants. My favorite tracks were in the Thieves Den level. The music is kind of boring though. Its lacks the intensity and fun of the older games. Sadly even the sound has glitches. sometimes the music and sounds skip. In the Dragon Dojo the sound of the enemies attacking skipped the entire time I was in the level and wouldn't go away until I left.  Lengh: This game is short. I MEAN short. Its only one world! I mean WTF! Spyro the dragon had 5 worlds including a bonus, Riptos Rage had 3 including an bonus, and Year of the dragon had 4 including many extras. This has one world with 7 or 8 short levels! From my knowledge theres not even a bonus for getting all coins and dragonflies. You don't get all your money from Moneybags the bear, theres no extra powers, nosatisfying cutscene, or any reason to try and complete the levels 100%. As mention earlier nothing happened when I defeated Ripto so I know this because of a LP I saw on Youtube.   In short Spyro Enter the Dragonfly was a huge disappointment. This game could have been good if put in the right hands. I would love to see it remade with all these problems taken care of, but given the bad recession this series has had lately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.	-1
I've said it before and I'll say it again, Universal Vivendi ruined this series for me.  This game is better than the one I have for the Wii but not by much.  There's only one world to explore and like a previous reviewer said, the level portals aren't named so that is a bit of a pain.  Yes you do have to collect something other than gems in this one as in previous Spyro titles but mine froze quite a bit (probably got one of the earlier copies released) and the load time was annoying.  I'm used to the PS games taking time to load but this one took forever!  I could've gone and made a five course meal in the time it took.  Okay so I'm exaggerating but as I recall the first 3 Spyro titles had quicker load times.  Either way, even though it's been almost six years since I bought this game, I'm still disappointed with it.	-1
I had read that this game was not up the usual high standards of the Spyro series. But, being a big Spyro fan, I decided to give it a chance. Well I should have listened to the bad reviews because this game is very much inferior to the other Spyros I have played - "A Hero's Tail" for the PS2 and all of the Spyro PS1 games.  The load time for being transported to different worlds is way too long and the game itself is way too short. The challenges are less fun, movement is sluggish and there are several "glitchs" that caused the game to stop and forced me to start again. Overall it is just a very poorly designed game. Apparently the folks at Universal Interactive are no match for the people at Insomniac. The only bright side is that the game does still contain the same basic elements of play - collect gems and dragonflys to achieve 100% completion. But I would only recommend this to be the biggest Spyro fans who have already played the other Spyro games and even then you are likely to be disappointed.	-1
The graphics really aren't improved enough to make up for the loading issues, nor are the levels that long. Plus these 5+ minute loading times are there not only when you go to a different world and/or level, but also when you enter a mini-game within a level. This makes leaving and coming back to something more time consuing than doing a part at that very moment because you'll load while leaving the mini-game, then load while leaving the level, and load 2 more times getting back to that mini-game. There are major glitches in the PS2 version, I don't know about any other versions. I've beaten every Spyro game, and this would have otherwise been as good as the others. I'd recommend having a portable game to play during the loads or something else to occupy that time, or not playing.	-1
When I heard a new spyro game was out, I happily rented it. When I entered it into my PS2, I quickly noticed that this game was not made by Insomniac (My favorite video game creators.) I assumed that I may still like this game. Well, I was 100% wrong! Why? 1) They have Ripto return after you defeated him in the first game. 2) Graphics that make it look like the worlds are made of paper, and 3) The glitches. I then thought, The perfect spyro series has been ruined. So, instead of buying this awful, and stupid game, play the PS1 spyro games. Sadly, this is the worst game I have ever and always will be, other than any PS2 spyro game. Bye.	-1
I am a big Spyro fan, and I bought this right when it came out and was bummed out. I seriously wouldn't recommend this game. If you've never played any Spyro games I'd recommend the 1st 3. They are REALLY awesome :) but this ps2 game is boring, and the graphics pretty much suck. It gets me dizzy just playing it b/c the camera shakes at times. If you still want to play this game, (in my opinion) you should probably rent it.	-1
This Spyro game had everyone excited, but when it finally came out, it sucked. The game looks great and it has new features, but that doesn't make up for all the problems with it. It's gameplay is slow, and the storyline is for a 5 year old. With this game, Spyro lost all his attitude. In my point of view, the developers didn't even try on this one.	-1
This game is one of the worst games that I have ever tried. When my friend went to his hometown for the weekend, he lent me the ps2, lending me GTA VC and Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly. GTA was pretty good, i don't see whats so great about it but... spyro is just horrible!!! The other spyro games make it seem like you are free jumping into the air and feel like an actual flying thing. This is so annoying it feels like you are controlling an elephant... seriously! He jumps and [waddles] down onto the ground. The abilities are really stupid, and the plot is just plain sh*tty. I mean, come on, this game doesnt take more than 6 hours to completely unlock EVERYTHING and thats if you want to waste money and time on this crap. It's disgusting.. with jumping limited (he can jump like 2 inches) I've attempted to jump up to a platform, which makes me fall 90% of the time, then i have to climb 5 other platforms to get back to it. And when you run into a wall or object it rumbles and gives you a feeling that a slow, stupid elephant has ran into a wall and gotten hurt. I would never buy this game, you have to unfreeze dragons, which look like a bigger, fatter, even stupider (if you can imagine possible) spyro that gives you a bunch of coins. The loading times are just HORRIBLE! I had to wait like 15 minutes for the game to get to the title screen, then another half hour getting through all the stupid cut-scenes and loading times to actually PLAY this game. This game is a COMPLETE waste of money and it will be disappointing for all spyro's fans. Bottom line: If you buy this game you will definately be disappointed, if u like it, get it, but im warning you the game gets VERY annoying in all aspects, and now that ive tried it out there is NO way I am EVER getting this.	-1
When I bought the item , it said that it was like new , when the controller to me the entire right side doesnt work. and there is a crack in the right side as well.	-1
they was this controller was discribed was not in the condition as stated. The color was very faded and scratched up, the pads on the joy stick had extreme wear and holes in it. Look like a garage safe reject. If this is the quality they sell then they have lost me as a customer.	-1
The official PS2 controller is what you need in case the one that came with the syetem breaks , its a good idea to have 2 controllers for one person just in case !	-1
It it not worth a penny! I'm a huge Spyro fan, when it came in the mail of course I was excited, but that quickly changed! There are only 9 levels. It take SOOO LONG to load! it loads the loading! I can't play it without finding a glitch. One time I ran past a seagull in the beach level and the sound of it chirping stuck then the sound of underwater stuck on top of that and it sounded like nothing I've ever heard before! I had to shut it off because it wouldn't stop, I even reset it! The characters look DUMB like there is no bone in their body or brain in their skull. (if they had one) they look too jello like, and the voices don't match their mouth. When you attack an enemy you can't tell that you made s successful hit till it dissapears. In the old games the controller would jump and you would hear and see the impact of Spyros head, so you KNOW you hit him. And when you charge a sheep it burns into lamb chops... Sorry I though that only happend with fire?  They ruined the sheep, they are all fat and slow, instead of quick and springy. Over all the ONLY thing that I found nice in the game was the graphics, it is beautiful. Without Insomniac Spyro will never be the same.	-1
I've been a huge fan of Spyro the Dragon for many years. This is the first release of Spyro for the PS2, and is made by a new company. I had heard many poor reviews about Spyro in the hands of this new company. It was made by Universal Interactive instead of Insomniac, who wrote the old Spyro games. I still have my older Spyro games so I played them side by side to see just what the difference was. First, yes the graphics are better. I would hope so! The other games are from 2000 and before, and were for the Playstation (not the PS2). So in this new version the baskets, for example, are very pretty with their weave and decoration. The water ripples when Spyro runs through it, the grasses in the water wave. Even so, curved surfaces aren't as smooth and clean as in other current games, such as FFX and Kingdom Hearts. Graphics do not make a game, though, and we found the new Spyro gameplay to be ... sluggish. In the other Spyros you feel like you have an energetic kitten on your hands, one that jumps and springs and moves quickly. In this new Spyro, it's more like a baby elephant lumbering along. The sounds don't seem to match up well with screen actions, either. There are often delays between when an action occurs and the sound kicks in. Even worse, though, are the serious coding errors evident. I'm a programmer by profession so I know it can be tough to make a game perfect. However, this game didn't seem to get even simple testing done before it was released! There were NUMEROUS problems with drawing glitches on the screen, causing giant polygons to block our view. And when we tried to play through the display problems, it crashed. Repeatedly. I really wanted the game to work well. The plot of 'the dragonflies have been stolen' seemed fun. You got to have bubble breath to capture them, and lightning breath for other tasks. There were the usual gem collecting and fun enemies. But with the sluggy gameplay and the continual crashes, it becomes very tiring very quickly. Rent this one first to see if your love of Spyro is enough to overcome those obstacles.	-1
I played this Spyro game first and found it flat and tedious. Everything in it feels like a chore rather than a challenge. It feels like gameplay balance was a secondary consideration, if that. Recently, I had the pleasure of playing one of the older Spyro games for the PSX and I realized that this newer game is just a rehash of material that Insomniac gave us in earlier Spyro games--but this PS2 Spyro lacks the charm and gameplay of the Insomniac games. It all feels like someone bought the rights to Spyro and just slapped together a game--glitchy, uninspired, and graphically deficient. In fact, the PSX graphics in the earlier games are almost as good as those in "Enter the Dragonfly;" ETD looks for all the world like they simply took the models used for the PSX and rendered them at PS2 resolutions. Embarrassing. The only enjoyable thing about this game is the music. Spyro creator Insomniac Games has moved on to "Ratchet & Clank," and I suggest that Spyro fans do the same. If this is the Spyro of the future, stick with the Spyro of the past: for less than the price of ETD, you can buy all 3 of the vastly superior Insomniac Games Spyro titles.	-1
I was never a fan of the Playstation 2 controller. I don't like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad. Using an analog stick is annoying because you don't feel comfortable with it. Ask any older gamer- they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad. With an analog stick, you slide all over the place. In addition to that disaster, the PS2 controller also suffers from "too many buttons". We shouldn't have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game. The Playstation One had the best controller ever. It was comfortable, you were always in complete control, and it just looked better.	-1
THIS GAME KILLED SPYROS GREATNESS HERES STUFF ABOUT THE GAME SOUND:1/10 TERRIBLE GRAPHICS:5/10 OK I GUESS LONGNESS:1/1O WAY TO SHORT FASTNESS:1/10 WAY TO SLOW COOLNESS:1/10 NOTHING IS COOL ABOUT IT RESULT:IT STINKS DONT BUY THIS GAME ITS HORRBILE DONT EVEN RENT IT SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOME OTHER GAME.	-1
sorta. The quick summary is "unfinished, rather buggy and far too short".  Especially compared to the first three, which I loved. I 100% completed the game in about 8 hours, and I'm not a particularly good player.  Given that the game has very little replay value... it's just not worth the money.  It'd probably be OK as a rental. (I find myself saying that a lot lately--maybe I should take the hint?) The in-game camera isn't so hot.  It's a lot better than most, but it occasionally got stuck (trying to control Spyro "by remote control 30 feet away" isn't much fun) and had this occasional tendency to spin around in a full circle. The framerate takes a serious hit when there are a lot of active monsters or dragonflies on the level.  One level in particular (Cloud 9, which is mostly wide-open space) had really bad problems, and the game even froze a few times while I was playing that level.  This level also revealed some very painful clipping issues (trying to make a long glide to some hidden gems required repeating ~1/2 the level time after time, as I kept hitting some invisible thing or other and falling...) Speaking of which, there's a serious lack of "Zoe" in-level save points.  There are usually two, one about 1/3 of the way into the level and the other about 1/2.  So, if you screw up on the last half of the level... yep, you get to repeat at least 1/2 the level.  This makes exploring the levels no fun at all, since if you fall off somewhere you have to start way back at the middle. The controls seem awkward and caused a lot of frustration.  Spyro can't recover from touching something while he's flying (as I recall he could start flying again in the previous games unless he ran smack right into an object) and using the hover button also totally kills his ability to fly.  Hover also seems to kill 99.9% of his forward momentum--a big change from the previous games, and I regularly missed jumps by undershooting. The monsters are incredibly wimpy.  I never got killed by any of them (heck, I may never have even gotten hit by any of them).  Except for the boss, of course; he wasn't horribly hard, but I think missiles that follow you around is almost bordering on cheating (and he could fire faster than Spyro could recover from a stun, so depending on exactly where you were when you were hit it would be certain death). I didn't run into any truly serious bugs but I'm sure there are several, as I saw a plethora of minor problems.  That, the framerate issues, lack of in-game movies (there's exactly one besides the intro and ending movies and it's _totally_ out of place), and the shortness of the game basically scream "it wasn't anywhere near finished but we shipped it anyway". There's several minigames, most of which are fun to play (and some are quite creative), but I found only a couple of them were worth playing more than once.  The races were surprisingly easy compared to the first three games, not a huge problem but again disappointing. The level portals aren't named, and they look identical for the most part.  Annoying as all get out--especially if you want to go back to a particular minigame or sublevel. Let's see, something nice to say... I thought the graphics were pretty good, and the in-game voices were fine... of what we heard of them, as there was very little interaction with other characters in the game. (Moneybags makes a single token appearance, Zoe has one thing to say, and ditto for the other characters.  Hunter shows up 3-4 times I think, the most of any of the other characters.) I'll give it two stars because I actually bothered to finish it, but it really wasn't that good and certainly wasn't worth the money.  I suggest renting it instead.	-1
Loved Spyro, in all the previous forms.  While the graphics are pretty, they come at the expense of game play.  First, the game is EASY!  Riptoc's revenge had many tricky puzzles and skill challenges that kept the game interesting for all ages.  If any of the bad guys kill you in this game, you probably forgot to hit pause.  Also, 45 second loads between screens! And there appear to be at least three bugs in the game, where you are racing the bad guys, and go from fourth, to third, to third, to third... can't win and therefore will not be able to finish the game??? All in all, it is intersting to play a new spyro game, but the flaws are colossal.  Finish it and break out one of the PS1 games.	-1
And we're not talking dragonflies!  I don't think they beta tested this game at all.  Unlike the PS1 games, this one is loaded with flaws. I have only explored 2 worlds besides the main world and the game has frozen twice, the sound has vanished, and some monsters weapons extend beyond the horizon and through walls. Annoyances: You have to hear the name of each dragonfly you catch, and Spyro always says "Hey it's:..."  (could be a tad more diverse) Can't skip intro production credits. Load times take far too long. There should be an option to turn off the auto help.  I don't want to be stopped constantly in the early levels and be told how to do something I know how to from previous games.  If this is your first Spyro game, then turn that on. Lastly, it plays slow. I give it 2 stars because when you do get a chance to play, it is fun, and brings back the enjoyment of the previous games, but it is too painful to play. Nice new features include new breath weapons. Some well thought out puzzles. The game could have been a lot better.  If this is your first Spyro experience, you probably won't be as dissapointed (except for the bugs).  Rent it, see if you like/tolerate it.	-1
I really want to like this game. Trust me, I really do. I'm a huge fan of mythology, especially Greek, Egyptian, Norse and Japanese. Well, three of those are included in this game. I also love Age of Empires 1 and 2, so this game has everything I would ever want, right?  Sadly, that's not the case. This game is AoE with a mythology theme (yay), except that it's worse than AoE in pretty much every aspect. The main problem with the game is that you are much more limited than AoE (a step back) - for example, limits on houses and smaller population limits. The graphics are also a small step down from AoE II.  The god powers and choices seemed neat at first but ultimately add little to the game. There aren't a whole lot of buildings and technologies, either. Units look unique but ultimately they are rather similar in their usefulness. You would think that with only 3 possible empires (or 4, with Atlanteans), there would be more variety between them, but there really isn't. The age advancement seems shallow and happens way too fast. Overall, the balance and flow of the game feels awkward and uneven. The single player AI makes really odd decisions, too.  The absolute worst thing about the game is that the UI is terrible and it is far buggier than polished AoE II. The UI is seriously awful.  YOU CANNOT CHANGE KEYBINDS. I repeat, in a real-time strategy game that relies completely on keybinds for success, there are NO options to change them. This alone ruined the game for me. What on earth they were thinking when they failed to include this option in a PC strategy game, I have no freakin' idea.  Overall, not a completely terrible game but I felt like I wasted my money on it, as I was bored rather quickly and only got a few hours of gameplay out of it, before going back to play AoE again.  I still love the music, though.	-1
Beware: This program, like many other recent games, will ONLY run on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000. That means that in most common home settings, school settings, or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game. If you have configured your home PC, for example, so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them "limited" accounts (a recommended "best practice" you should certainly be following), your kids will not be able to play this game. Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to "user-level" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game. Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Age of Mythology is a good game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation...	-1
While at the mall, I was pretty bored of most strategic games. So I picked up Age of Mythology thinking I would be treated to a great gift. But now I have mixed feelings for the game.  It is just like ages of empires. The resources are the same and gathering them are the same. But there is a new one called favor. To buy myth units or certain upgrades you need favor. For the Greeks you pray at a temple, Egyptians build monuments, and Norse fight. The Greeks are basically the regular race. The main one in the game. They are okay, but kinda boring after a while. The Egyptians have cool god powers, and do not really need to chop wood for any reason. The Norse are the best, they have the best units and can build quickly with their army. While playing online, Norse always dominate because they build several fortresses right outside your town then attack. Because Norse build buildings with their infantry, they have a huge advantage. But their godpowers are not that great compared to the other races.  God powers are given to you when you advance an age. If you advance to a new age you get to pick a minor god to worship, and each god has its own god power. Most of the god powers are kinda lame, and you can just waste. Zeus has a lighting bolt which kills one unit, but does not kill main units in the story, so it has no point. The only good ones are meteor, tornado, plenty vault, and earthquake. Meteor and tornado are the best Egyptian god powers, because they decimate areas of buildings. Earthquake and plenty vault rock. Earthquake belongs to the Greek and totally destroys every building in an area. Plenty vault also belongs to the Greek and provides a steady resource flow.  But the fighting gets old. The unit selection is awesome, but still, norse will win. Norse have the best units and just rock. Egyptian do not need alot of wood, so they can be good. Greek needs everything and the only rewarding experience is the 2 god powers I mentioned above. If you truly love ages of empire you can like this game. Most missions result in you killing one unit, then going on to the next mission and rebuilding your base all over. So the campaign gets really frustrating. Especially on moderate where the attacks are constant. In all seriousness, if you want to buy this game go ahead, but please wait till it is on sale.	-1
I find it hard to believe that the world's most powerful software company is putting out an RTS game in 2002 that is this thin.  Don't get me wrong, I agree with the other reviewers who say that AOM delivers the best graphics of any strategy game to date.  In addition to this, I'd like to add that AOM uses system resources very efficiently (after 10 hours of gaming I have experienced exactly zero crashes), and plays quickly (no more 12 hour marathons like we had with Age of Empires).  And suprisingly for an MS product, the game also has pretty darn good instructions (although you really won't need these if you've ever played an RTS before). But, this is why I give it two stars... 1) Very limited selection of warriors and special creatures --only two types of horseman, two types of footman, and four types of mythic creatures on any one side (AOE has at least three times as many unit types) 2) Only four levels for Single User Random Map Play (and this from a game that advertises on the box: "Strategic Depth") 3) Steep limitations on use of god powers 4) God powers not really that powerful and are, at best, uninspired 5) The games AI that is used to run your opponents is more artificial than intelligent 6) Due to the above and unlike many of other RTS's, this game has very little replay value, and thus isn't worth the steep price MS is asking	-1
Looking like a 3D Age of Empires with three separate races almost as different as to be like Starcraft, Age of Mythology had potential to be a great game.  Despite being an old game of only 1.5 gigabytes or so, the game ran smoothly, with units moving in formation automatically, looking quite smooth and small.  It is still gratifying to see villagers hit a tree with a few axe hits, then see the thing keel over and stay on the ground until it's been fully chopped, or to see dying units stay on the field, gradually disintegrating into corpses, then into nothing.  There's nothing wrong at all with the engine or the animation or anything.  It was fun and highly entertaining.  The thing that drags this game down is where all strategy games should shine their brightest: combat.  A single Greek Hoplite takes up 2 population points, with each house providing 15 population points, each town center about 15-20 (I forget) and you receiving a limit of 10 houses on a map, and only as many town centers as there are villages on the map (which as as sparingly placed as gold mines), so you're never likely to have an army bigger than a few dozen units at a time.  But you're never likely to get 50-60 or even 100 units on the field at once.  The higher up you progress on the unit scale, the more population each unit eats up.  None of the units is particularly effective against other units save to bash at them for a minute or so before their target dies.  The mixing of mythology and reality in the game is almost seamless, but there's still a sense of disbelief to it, and when even the most basic Myth unit overpowers some of the toughest Human units, it pretty much becomes a literal "Age of Mythology"  Battles will be decided mostly by myth units.  It doesn't matter if you've amassed an army of hundreds of basic infantry, because a wave of Colossi, or Dragons, or Anubites, or a spell like Meteor, Lightning storm, etc will wipe them out in minutes if they are in big enough number.  God powers are another thing that are grossly overpowered.  While it's absolutely beautiful watching meteor strike smack into an enemy base and leave giant craters while temporarily flooding the area with light, it's a bit much to see almost the entire selected patch of an enemy base crumbling before a single meteor strike or earthquake or whatever.  Granted, you can only use this godpower once per level, but who needs to use it more than once?  Myth units get progressively stronger as you upgrade and select different Gods to worship and gain their respective powers, upgrades, and myth units, but in the end all infantry and cavalry are rendered useless before the might of the myth units.  The same problem that plagued Red Alert 2 plagues this game.  Goods:  - Simple, yet smooth and beautiful graphics make the game fun to watch.  - A complex array of units awaits those who wish to fight with humans rather than myth units.  - Units speak their native languages (Greeks speak ancient Greek, Egyptians speak ancient Egyptian, Norse speak some sort of Scandinavian).  - Easy and steady interface makes it user-friendly and not a mad rush for resources or a mad rush for infantry.  Slow and steady could actually win you the race, if you're playing wisely.  Neutral:  - Myth units are a bit garish in their style and size.  - God powers can be used only once, which is good for some (like meteor or earthquake) and bad for others.  - Buildings can take a long time to break down, requiring siege equipment  Bad:  - Myth units are grossly overpowered, and render human infantry useless once into the midst of the game.  - Strict population limits and high unit population cost means combat will be limited and no more than 80 units can be fielded by one side at a time.  - Repetitive nature of Myth units and God powers makes replayability a myth in itself.  - God powers are souped up superweapons, with an earthquake capable of leveling an entire enemy base of all its buildings save for town centers, fortresses, and other heavier buildings.  All in all, it was a fun game to play at first, but replayability is not a realistic thought.  Myth units dominate the game (which some would argue they should, being as the name of the game is "Age of Mythology", but it does so at the cost of human infantry entirely).  If myth units are designed to be the elite in this game, why bother with so much work on an extensive and quite complex selection of human infantry/cavalry?  That appears to be my only major problem, but it's a big one.	-1
I found this game to be incredibly boring.	-1
I have never played #2 or #3, but from what I've read and heard, they have all the parts of this game that I didn't like amplified. I originally rented this years ago in a quest for a new platform in between Spyros. It was kind of cute, but everything just seemed dull and repetitive. No puzzles, missions, or anything. Just firing at enemies. Eventually I got to an area where I couldn't find the way through, passed the controller on.	-1
People will say whatever companies want them to, but not me.  What the companies don't want you to hear about Splinter Cell is it's horrible story line, it's lack of options, and the atari style graphics that fill this game.  I am a computer gamer, I play more games than anyone and I know games better.  Trust me.	-1
While I understand that franchise games tend to lean on their franchise as a crutch, even despite the cutscenes from the movie this game is virtually devoid of story. The fact that you can't skip the poorly-done game cinematics doesn't help the poor presentation, and while the series is supposed to be grand, this ends up 'walk forward and kill things'. The fact that the Fellowship will follow and help sometimes but not others feels untrue to the movies and book. Story: 3/10  I'm not the kind of person to demand photo-realism or exact replication - I still enjoy playing&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Chrono-Cross/dp/B00004TC6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Chrono Cross</a>&nbsp;- but this game was truly unimpressive. It's not 'gasp, it's Dong Zhuo!' ugly, but it's disappointing. Graphics: 5/10  At least the sound effects do all the right stealing. The movies sound pretty good, and the game sounds fair. Music and in-game sound-effect volume can be altered independently, but the ambiance lacks a certain polish that I expected from the movies the game is based off. Sound: 6/10  While the music is indeed stolen from the movies, what shows in the game is toned down background material. While&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Third-Age/dp/B0002IQD1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Lord of the Rings The Third Age</a>&nbsp;may not have been the most innovative RPG, at least it sounded and looked nice throughout. Music: 5.8/10  This is repetitive action requiring complex combos for unimpressive-looking moves, along a narrow path that offers none of the free exploration of the wide, impressive lands of the movies. Your ability to upgrade your character is based on how skilled (lucky) you are in the level, because you can't replay and this means that if you have a bad run, your only option is to reset the game and load all over again. None of the skills really seem to change gameplay that much, as an RPG this game falls flat on its face and as a hack-and-slash it makes&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dynasty-Warriors-4/dp/B00007KQE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dynasty Warriors 4</a>&nbsp;look great (it's not). The local co-op consists of the middle six levels where a friend can follow you along the narrow, short levels, but isn't nearly as easy to get into as good co-op games where you can generally have a friend help from the start. Gameplay: 4/10  You don't even get the option to play co-op until after you've already spent at least a half-hour beating the first two levels, and then you have to save and quit to the main menu to discover that levels can't be repeated. What? You didn't have a lucky run with Gimli and you're too short for that one minimally helpful upgrade? Start all over. The fact that the first two levels can only be played with one fixed character and all but one of the rest are locked to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli don't help. There are extras you automatically unlock by progressing through the missions, but unlike The Third Age there's little good organization or sense of true satisfaction. Replayability: 1/10  With the large number of five-star reviews, I had high expectations, and perhaps that was part of the problem. Everything it tries to do has already been done better elsewhere, and while I'm not going to say this game was horrible, it was short and lackluster - barring getting stuck on a level, you can finish in one sitting of just a few hours (though boring load times and unskippable cutscenes don't help). If you want a good Lord of the Rings RPG,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Third-Age/dp/B0002IQD1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Lord of the Rings The Third Age</a>&nbsp;is superb compared to this. If you want hack-and-slash, look for a different franchise. I wouldn't even suggest a rental, but do that before you consider buying, even for bargain-bin prices. Overall: 3.7/10	-1
wat were they thinking when they made this game i would have more fun watching the clothes in a laundry machine go up and down	-1
I'm not a fan of the Lord of The Rings movies, and I still don't know why, I accidentally have this game cause the graphics and the fighting system was looking cool. But all of it fails into a disappointment.  When you put the CD you are encouraged to watch a video clip from the movie, you CANT SKIP the cut-scenes in this games and they have a long length. You see more of the REAL MOVIE CLIPS and less of 3D Cut scenes, which means that was a lacked effort of the producers of the game.  First there was this tutorial in this game that didn't help a lot. When you fight WITH ANY CHARACTERS you get knocked down VERY easily and is just a matter of second until your character is dead then again you have to watch the cut scenes without being able to skip it and start the entire level again.  Other than that all the characters are different, but the game play issues are still there... there is also a combo system where you can "purchase" different attacks depending on the experiences you got in the stage/level. The game is cheap and very linear; no turning back, just go straight forward and sometimes the static cameras won't help because the game usually overwhelms you with enemies (Orcs and orcs and..... zzzzz). The game is still good looking sometimes and is not special compared to other games that i have played.  Buy or rent? Rent it. Don't think that because you are a fan of the movies you will like this game.	-1
The only reason I gave this game more than one star is the graphics, which are pretty decent. However, the rest of the game is another story. First off it is amazingly short, it took me one day to beat it, (and I was only playing it when the movie I was watching was on commercial). It consists of 12 "levels" where the only objective is to kill orcs, you cannot adjust your camera angle (which leads to very awkward battling), and you have to memorise complicated "moves" (for instance one was XXO^^R2) to even have a chance in Helm's Deep, They do let you change characters, however Aaragon is the only useful one (I tried the other 2, but then you have to memorise even more ridiculous moves) To sum it all up, it is basicly short clips of the movie, where they let you play in a few scenes. The total game-play is 10 hours MAX I beat it in 6.. I was truly disappointed in this game. However, it is worthy of renting for fans of the movie.	-1
i originall said that this game was an excellent game, but after playing the xbox version and the playstation 2 demo, i now know that this computer version is the gayest thing that can ever happen to the personal computer.  i have to say that the only good thing about this game is that it is challenging, but in between the game jumping around with you graphics settings and the fact that the controls are kind of messed up, this is in actual fact a terrible game for the computer, because of the fact that it probably won't run as well as you want it to.	-1
The main problem I have with this game is the stupid camera.  I'm not generally a big fan of the 3rd person games (unless they're side-scrollers or top-down), esp. when you're expected to aim at something, but this one really stinks it up because the camera angle is not consistent since they're trying to make it look cinematic.  If you run back a little to regroup (e.g. in Fangorn Forest), due to "artistic" changes in camera angle, you may find yourself surrounded and unable to even see the character you're controlling.  This "game" was made to be looked at, not played.  If you want to fight and use cool combos, try Tekken Tag.  If you want to shoot at things, go with Timesplitters 2, Silent Scope, or a Bond game.  If you want a medieval fantasy fighting game, try Dark Alliance.  If you want to watch a movie, watch a movie.	-1
