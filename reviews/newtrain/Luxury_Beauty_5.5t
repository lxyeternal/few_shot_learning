Love this product. I use it over my eyeshadow for a great sparkle without it looking like sparkles. Also if you put in the corner or your eye (nose side) it really opens up your eyes and makes them appear bigger	1
The top coat goes on smoothly with a brush. I like to use a light coat over makeup, it adds some sparkle, but I can control it to tone it up or down. The sparkles are very tiny. Please note that it adds some whitish tint to makeup, so you might need to adjust your other makeup when you use the sparkles.	1
I ordered this sparkling shadow top coat for my wife and she loves it. The glimmering particles in it are very fine. As a result, it's has more of a shimmery effect than a sparkling effect. The best way to use it is with a finger. It's easy to spread and wear as a top coat on existing eye shadow for a glistening fresh look. My wife said this is one of the sparkling top coat products done right and is looking forward to trying out other colors in this product line.	1
I like this SPARKLING SHADOW TOP COAT in Celestial Sparkle.  What I was expecting was something over-the-top. All sparkly and suitable for 6 year olds, but it's actually very very nice. More of a shimmer than sparkle and therein lies the difference.  I had my 14 year-old daughter try it first. Being younger most makeup looks better on her, but after seeing the shimmering effect on her I decided to try it myself.  Turns out it gives a little pizzazz to not only lids, but cheeks as well.  Not something I'd wear during the day, but definitely something I might try for an after hours event as it gives you a gentle glow.  Recommend.  (It seems very pricey but you don't use very much. Could be used on lips as well)	1
From the name of this product, I thought the highlights would be pearly white but it turns out that it is a beautiful gold sparkle.  I have olive complexion and the gold goes fantastic with my skin tone.  It really dresses up my eye makeup and makes my eyes shine.  I plan on wearing this as my top coat shadow for the upcoming holiday season parties.  It isn't something that I would wear every day in my lifestyle but it is certainly something that I would wear when I want to really dress up.	1
Ive used other shadow top coats before but this one is my favorite. If youve never used a shadow top coat, it is just a shimmery creamy shadow that you apply either as your shadow or over your other shadow to create a glitzed up look. This one is wonderful because the color (mine is Celestial Sparkle) is a lovely ivory color. It is more shimmery instead of glittery. I applied it over my existing eye shadow and it just made my eyes and eye makeup pop. I put it over my lid, next to my lashes and mostly towards my inner eye. This is wear I like to wear a lighter color to brighten my eyes. If you are younger than I, you could probably get away with wearing it near your eyebrows in the highlight area. The easiest way to apply is to just use your finger.  This is a look that is really nice for dinner, parties and anytime that you're wanting to look glam. It isn't an over the top look. It looks really nice. Im looking at getting other colors.	1
This shadow has a high sparkle factor and would be perfect for this time of the year and the holidays when you just want that bit more to show off those beautiful baby blues.  I tend to mix things a lot so I have tried this mixed with my different shades of purple that I wear and it gives it a really nice humph.  It brings the sparkle out more in my eyes while brightening them up.  I think the eyes are the most attractive part of the face and what better way to show them off than with some extra sparkle.  The shadow goes on easily and mixes easily.  If using this alone it will really highlight your eyes but if mixing I would apply your regular shadow first and then a light layer of this for maximum benefit	1
The mascara goes on smoothly and it's obvious from the first stroke that your lashes will look somewhat fuller. Longer? Well a little. It's all going to depend on how many strokes you apply. Don't expect the look you often see on models or actresses without applying a whole lot of this product. But since the heavily lined and lashed look isn't good on me, I only apply it to my upper lashes and am happy with the look when stroking my lashes a few times. You can definitely feel the fiber when touching your dried lashes.  The home party facial wash product I use easily removes the mascara when washing my face and I'm not finding any smudges on my lower lids as the day progresses; something that's a regular occurrence with some of the cheaper mascaras I've used.  I hesitate when it comes to the price. Whether it's worth it or not will depend on how important that darker look around the eyes is to you. I have used an even more expensive mascara--again, free to review--that I actually like better than this one. But the price...	1
Personally, for me, this mascara did not lengthen my eyelashes much, if at all.  However, that being said, it did work nicely as a great basic mascara i.e. the kind you'd wear during the day as a great "pop" but nothing outlandish.  The black is a great black - not super harsh.  It has a tendency to clump so thin, light layers are a must with drying time in between.  There are fibers in the product but I didn't have any luck getting them on my lashes but they sure were clumping everywhere in the bottle.  This also tended to end up all over my cheeks and eyelids so I recommend when using this product to start with the mascara first so you don't have to redo your eyes.  Bottom line: a good basic go-to mascara but nothing that will stop people in the street to stare at your eyes	1
no need to describe Michelle Phan, this stuff is good. LASH GALLERY LENGTHENING MASCARA Black for Asian girls who have smaller eyes (with all due respect), this stuff makes your eyes look 18% bigger when you add eyeliner.  Easy to apply, make sure you crimp the lashes to curl up and out a bit first.  Then application is fast and easy.  No allergies.  Easy to wash off, with warm water or just some moisturizing creme then rinse. Long lasting.  you can apply several times (after drying each time), to make it even longer.  Pretty good	1
This is a very good mascara. It does exactly what it says it does. It lengthens and it actually looks natural next to my natural eyelashes. It does not thicken and look like a huge gunk like other mascara I have used. I also like the curved applicator. It makes it even more natural looking.   It also does not sting my eyes like some other mascaras that I have had problems with. My only gripe is with the price. I wish it was cheaper than $16.	1
I had no experience with the em michelle phan brand before trying this mascara so I had no idea what to expect, but I found myself pleasantly surprised.  This mascara formula with microfibers really does make your lashes look longer.  I followed my typical mascara routine curling my lashes first with a lash curler and then followed up with two even coats of this mascara and they look noticeably longer.  I also had no problems with my lashes sticking together, they look nice and distinct.  This doesn't have as dramatic of effects as applying false eyelashes, but for mascara it's about the most effective I've tried for lengthening lashes.  (And that is saying a lot because I am quite promiscuous with my mascaras and have tried quite a range of specialty, department store, and drug store brands.)  I also found this shade of black to be very flattering.  I have blonde hair with gray eyes and it definitely made my eyes pop, but didn't look too severe or dramatic for everyday.  They also wear very well.  I don't have any problems with smudges and or flaking mascara.  In fact, the one night I wore this mascara to bed without taking it off my lashes looked surprisingly good the next morning.  I also found removal of this mascara to be no more difficult than with the other brands I've used.  A few swipes of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Neutrogena-Cleansing-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-Ounce/dp/B000NWAOHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Neutrogena Cleansing Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover, 5.5 Ounce</a>&nbsp;on a cotton ball has been all I've needed to remove the mascara and my subsequent applications have looked as good as the first time I tried this.  The one thing that remains to me to be seen is how long this mascara stays fresh. I typically love a mascara when it is new, but some seem to go clumpy quite quickly meaning I often find that mascara goes bad before I have a chance to use it all which is disappointing.  Here's to hoping this formula stays fresh for a good amount of time.  Overall I'm quite impressed with this mascara, especially for the price point and it has definitely made me curious to try other products in the em michelle phan line.	1
The color payoff was not nearly as impressive as some cheaper pallettes. The packaging was also bulky and odd to store away unlike the traditional slim black pallettes.	-1
This was listed as new and never used,  so I didn't bother to read anymore information. (My fault and it will never happen again) When received, one color was missing and others were loose. I went back on Amazon to read more. Not only did it say, new, never used, it went on to say used once. Go Figure. She refused me a refund!	-1
I first saw the em palette as a special offer on Ipsy. I was interested in it, but it was priced more than I wanted to spend. I was thrilled to see this as an Amazon daily deal recently, so I snagged it. I've been using the this make up palette daily since it arrived. There is a great variety of colors. A lot of them are natural and subtle which is what I prefer. I have been impressed with how long the color lasts. I apply my make up in the morning before going to work. I often notice that by lunch time it hardly looks like I have any make up on at all. I've been able to tell that it's still there (in a good way) well into the afternoon. I do have to reapply after work if I have plans out, but that is pretty normal anyway. I love using some of the colors as my eyeliner. I tend to rub my eyes a lot, so the powder doesn't last as long there, but the eye shadows and blush are good for most of the day.	1
According to my daughters... em michelle phan The Life Palette is perfect for an every day makeup user. The eye shadow is very thick and requires little to cover the eye with any of the choices. The blush and bronzer as well as the eye shadow did not make my face feel greasy or heavy like normal makeup does. Also the convenient small 'make-your-own' case was perfect for on-the-go fixes.  The only complaints I have are for the lip gloss/lip products and cleaning. I was not of the lip products due to the fact that they make my lips feel very greasy. The solid colors left a nice color that did not feather out. However, it felt very heavy. Also, the makeup was difficult to wash away with just water. This is probably good for humid days or even light rain. I had to use a makeup remover in order to get rid of the makeup (minus the lip product that was easily wiped away). This product did not cause any reaction with my skin as well, so if you have sensitive skin that is often prone to blackheads, then this makeup is great.	1
Overall this is a good product.  Just not for me. This set reminds me of the eyeshadow sets back in the 1980's.  You would buy a set that probably had ten or twelve different colors and only end up using three or four.  That's the way I feel about this set.  I don't see myself using all the colors.  And that, to me, seems like a waste.  There are some really dark colors which I could never wear.  Sure, some people will use them.  But then I doubt they would use the lighter colors. So again, waste.  There are lip gels, powder blush, eyeshadow and facial powder.  I don't use anything but cream foundation.  There's really not much foundation that would last very long.  It is nice that you can put some of the sections into a smaller holder.  But, I use colors from two different sections!  So, that doesn't work out very well.  I think I just like picking out the shades I like in larger quanities.  I don't like wasting anything!  I know I'll be wasting a lot of the colors in this set.  I am an artist and I tried mixing some of the colors together.  Way too time consuming!  I'm giving this a 4-star rating because it is nice makeup.  Nothing wrong with the product.  I hate to sound like a broken record but it is wasteful.  I took off one star for that aspect.	1
The trays are easy to remove and swap into the portable kit.  The colors go on smoothly and wear well.  You get eyeshadow, lip color, and blush, and an okay selection of brushes.  I'd add a brush kit to make it complete.  There is no lip brush (put on color with your finger I guess) and I find the blush brush a bit small for my taste.  I'd also prefer a better assortment of shadow brushes.  But that's the brushes.  The point is the makeup itself, and that is excellent.  The colors blend very well.  They look very natural for day wear.  To me the various sets each go to a season.  I'd suggest this for someone with a very fair complexion.	1
Michelle Phan has some really great, truly interesting youtube tutorials of applying various combo's of makeup.  While achieving different appearances and looks, for various occasions, Michelle gears them to look good on different facial structures' and she has quite the internet following.  I have seen several of her video's but don't actively follow what she puts out there.  I was given the opportunity to order this palette free of charge by Amazon, give it some testing and post my opinion on this product.  My research of this palette and makeup line entitled .EM by Michelle Phan, brought up that it was manufactured by L'Oreal cosmetics.  My drugstore makeup of choice is the L'Oreal brand, (although my first choice is to nab products on sales from the Clinique and Estee Lauder lines).  Upon receiving this Life Palette, my first impression was that it had a rather cheap dollar store presentation, this is deceiving.  The Large main pallet and accompanying smaller travel compact (which accompanied as a gift) are really well made and protective of the various circles of product, I'm thinking that the white background of the palette lead me to that initial conclusion.  Although the white most probably allow's the user to better access the makeup color's, a darker, brown or black background would have visually given the palette a richer more lux appearance (as well as fought  the messy residue look the white can take on).  Also with the large Pallet, comes a tool to remove the product circles and arrange them in your own personal fashion mix in either the large pallet or to transfer into the travel compact, stickers are also provided to classify your personalized mixes into the girl's.... day out , coffee break, weekend brunch, or day dreaming look.  Another application tool is provided with a small lip brush on one end and a shadow brush on the other.  The Make-up itself.....The eye circles have quite good pigmentation, the shadow's hold up fairly well, especially since I have rather dry skin, (even with an application of moisturizer beforehand).  I didn't care for Michelle's curation of the colors on this and moved them around several times till I found what worked specifically for me.  That is what is so great about this palette..... you modify it to fit your looks, your style.  The Make-up itself.....The lip color/gloss worked very well for me, love the selections of colors, ability to achieve a flat colored lippie or lush sheen effect.  The Make-up itself.....On the blush, the pigmentation is not the best I've tried, it was lacking, but then my preference is to go on the light side with blush and add if needed.  But must be noted that when using any of the choices on this palette, the blush takes further application and definitely best applied with your finger, a quality brush in blending in will be useful on your cheek but considering the blush circle's proximity to everything else in the palette, a one or two finger application first stage application is what I recommend, followed by a blending with a quality brush.  In conclusion..... This Palette has a big fun factor, trying out different looks, making your own color combo palette while checking out Michelle Phan's tutorial video's, and foremost an immense value for the price.	1
The em michelle phan The Life Palette and the theme Day Life is a wonderful collection. This set keeps everything in one place and the organized loving side of myself is just a little happier because of it.  I was delighted with the presentation and believe because of that, this palette or any of the others would make for a fabulous gift for a friend or family member. I can really tell that extra care and thought went into the whole package.  Day Life  is full of browns, mauve, and pinks. You've got cheek, lip, and eye makeups all covered. Shade names include peach, lottsa latte, berry busy, cappuccino, ballet flats, silver lining, and quite a few more. If you favor a more natural look, this is the theme you'll want to go with. It's not flashy or overly fancy which makes it perfect for a neutral everyday appearance.  The fun thing about this kit it is that you can mix and match to create your own look. I love being able to customize to exactly what works for me!  What this set includes is four themes Girl's Day Out, Coffee Break, Weekend Brunch, and Day Dreaming.  There is a pan pick stylus in which you can lift the magnetic makeups up and off as this palette is refillable. A travel compact where you can put your desired theme and take it along with you or to have on the ready at home is one of my favorite additions. You will need your own brushes to apply the cheek makeup but there's is one double ended lip and eye brush included that works for everything else. This brush however doesn't have a space to set if using the travel compact.  I'm still experimenting with makeup to find what suits my coloring and feel that this palette gives me full freedom in that. I'm very pleased with the pigmentation and feel the product as a whole is well worth the price. I would totally recommend it!	1
Wow... what is this, cosmetics wars? You have the 5 star reviews supposedly by the people who work for the product line, and then a load of 1 star reviews by people, who have a different problem - one of whom gives every product by this company 1 star, but still purchases the items the company offers, only to keep giving it 1 star. Now if I get something from a company that gets only 1 star, I probably won't be getting more of their products. It just seems a little odd and a little hard to believe either of the 'camps' reviews. I also noticed that Vine reviewers, who are totally impartial, give their honest opinions and are 'voted down' because they are giving it 3 - 5 stars (not just 1 star) - in other words giving *honest reviews* and which are obviously not making some people happy.  Seriously??  Moving on: I got this product to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I love eye shadow palettes and was excited to try something new.  This palette is okay but definitely not worth the price.  It came with a travel compact as well (a small compact to put your choice of eye shadows, blush, lipstick in).  The Good: - The eye shadows did appear to be packed well, I didn't have much trouble with fallout. - The blush had decent staying power - The lipstick went on nicely - The case is very solid and includes a tool to swap the different trays between the large palette and the travel compact.  The Neutral: - This is a mostly neutral eye shadow palette there are some greys and some mauves.  Two of the eye shadows have a very nice gold shimmer to them. - Most of the eye shadows are glittery.  There are only a few matte shadows in here.  So if you are a big matte eye shadow fan this isn't the palette for you.  The Bad: - The eye shadows do not have much pigmentation.  Not nearly as good as Urban Decay or even The Balm eye shadow palettes I have. - The eye shadow brush included is better than the foam applicator included in most drugstore eye shadows but still not all that useful.  I used it once and then never used it again. - The eye shadow trays are different sizes which is just weird, so you can only grab certain ones for your travel compact. -  The blush isn't very pigmented (I love my Tarte Amazonian Clay blush much better). - The two orange/brown colors in the blush were just off and looked really strange on (I have olive colored white skin) - There really isn't a good way included to apply the lipstick so I applied with  my fingers - The lipstick didn't have any staying power and it's not very portable so it isn't easy to reapply.  It also was very drying to my lips. - The palette and travel compact are very heavy. - The tool to change out the palette was hard to use and I kept dropping the trays on top of other trays (and denting the other eye shadows) when I tried to change them. - The palette has only shallow grooves for the transfer tool and the included eye shadow brush, so they kept falling out whenever I picked up the palette to use it...it was sooo irritating. - The travel compact has absolutely no place for a small eye shadow brush, this is really weird and makes it pretty much useless for throwing into your purse.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this palette.  I would recommend sticking to the better pigmented Urban Decay eye shadows.  If you do want a great eye shadow/blush palette The Balm's Balm Voyage palette is absolutely awesome and nearly half the cost of this one.	-1
This palette is totally giftable. It comes in an attractive box and then inside there are four separate mini-palettes.  THE KEY to this is the FREE Travel compact. What you are supposed to do is use the 'pick' tool to move the makeup you want for that day to the compact. It's a great idea and one that should appeal to most people.  MAKEUP QUALITY Michelle Phan made her debut on YouTube where she became a sensation with Tween, Teens, and 20 somethings. And okay... with moms like me. I watched the vids with my then-tween/now-teen daughter. They are truly entertaining and educational. I love Michelle's approach to makeup and life; it's just a lot more healthy and upbeat than most of the other media influences that my daughter and her friends run across.  In any case, Michelle caught the eye of a makeup company and they gave her a line. The makeup is okay. About on par with the sort your buy at the grocery story or the drugstore. It is however at a more premium price. And you are paying for the name.  SUMMARY I think the main problem with this product are the perky colors and the less than optimal pigmentation.  Lots of comments on this.  To which I'd say how pigmented do you want your turquoise eye shadow to be.  These are colors, in my opinion, geared to very young users.  If I saw them on a woman in the workplace I'd expect her to be reliving the 60's.  But that's just me. I have old references ;]  This makeup though is perfect for girls like my daughter who is 15. Teens like her tend to overdo their makeup. The less drastic pigmentation that others are complaining about is exactly what I want my teen using. LESS IS MORE.  So, excellent gift if the price isn't a problem. This collection looks nice and there's a variety of shades to play with. Do get the free compact and do purchase a selection of brushes. The one that came with this is totally pathetic.	1
It starts with the case--so heavy and super high-quality materials. The set contain four sets, or "beauty looks", and the user can label them with stickers, included. There is an instructions booklet included as well. It comes with an extra, mirrored, smaller case for travel purposes, one that can hold one of the four sets. The user uses the pick (included) to remove/relocate the shades, and it works very well because it is magnetic! Includes a double-ended liner/shadow applicator. Very nice!	1
The Day Life cosmetic palette has more conservative colors than some of the others offered by this brand and would be a good choice to give to a young lady who is old enough to wear makeup, but who is still experimenting to find shades that complement her natural good looks. They tend to be lightly pigmented and understated.  There are four themes: Girl's Day Out, Coffee Break, Weekend Brunch, and Day Dreaming.  The individual pans can be removed and carried in the travel-sized compact. A dual brush is also included.  The quality is comparable to reasonably-priced makeup from a drugstore.  For those not in the know, Michelle Phan is a makeup artist who caters to the younger set with a channel devoted to her show on YouTube. The EM Michelle Phan cosmetics are from L'Oreal.	1
For me, the Day Life color pallet works awesome. Normally when I use an eye shadow, even using just a small swipe of it on my skin makes the colors so bold it looks like I've colored my face with crayon. I'm just so fair skinned that anything but the lightest colors look too bright on me. But these eye shadows seem to go on in layers, so you can get just a bit of color, and then intensify it as needed.  With this set (Day Life), I'm able to apply the browns, greys and golds and they show up on my skin just right. My teen daughter who has more of a medium skin tone needs to apply most of the eye shadow colors a few times to get the color to her liking. So if you're fair skinned like myself, this set might work well for you.  The Day Life pallet has soft colors that look so nice on. Lots of neutral shades, light colored blushes and shiny glosses. I love how I can add just a touch of color without looking over done up. They're nice combinations and work well together.  The makeup comes in a HUGE plastic case that looks like an oversized pressed powder compact. Each of the circles of makeup can be removed and placed into the travel compact which is quite a bit smaller and has a built in mirror. Beside each of the circle color pallets there is a small groove in the case so you can get something small inside like a pin and lift each pallet out, without damaging them. I'm enjoying using this set so much that come summer I want to get the Beach Lift set as well.	1
Good quality, good color pigmentation; I like it a lot. Makes for a great gift.	1
The first thing I noticed about this product was the price. I thought it was too high until I got the product in the mail. It was in a high class box with a big container of makeup plus you get a separate compact to boot. My wife loved it. She was impressed with the many variety of colors and different applications. She sat down with my daughter and applied makeup to her(to her great delight) and had a ball. Although a few of the colors broke up a little bit but most of them there were no problems.  Great gift idea!	1
This is a beautiful and large pallet that has so many colors that it would suit anyone.  It can do so many looks that the possibilities are endless.  This also came with a little travel compact that you can pull the colors you like the most out of and put them in. This really is beautiful.	1
Just no. This is not how powder makeup should work, I have never bought a luxury face powder only for it to work worse than some drugstore ones! It will sink into every inch of your face and even when used with her foundation it will make your face look cakes even if you apply a little! Not to mention it dos not stay long and eventually it melts off, which is odd because I have combination skin but my T zone still isn't very oily. I just can't say anything I like about this product.	-1
I'm not an old lady yet, but I am well into middle age. I have very fair skin and it has a lot of weathering, so I look perhaps a little older than I am. This product gives very nice coverage, but is not ideal for mature skin. When I was younger I would have loved it, but on older skin it tends to accentuate the signs of aging. The compact is very nice, with a mirror that is large enough so you can actually see what you're doing when you powder your nose. Recommended for the younger set.	1
My wife has tried a variety of makeup products over the years and she is rather picky about what she prefers.  When she was given the chance to try this em Finish Powder Compact she was excited since this seemed to be a new player on the market.  What she found was that this product was excellent.  It required a very small quantity yet it lasted all day.  In addition it left a matte finish instead of an oily shine.  The powder also did not fall onto her clothes like a lot of the other powder products she has used.  After nearly a month's worth of use this product did not lead to any acne issues so it did not clog her pores.  The price is not cheap but it is not extravagant either which makes this an excellent product.	1
After trying a few different michelle phan cosmetic products, I get the feeling that it is all drug store quality with a higher end price tag. Non of the items performed or had the same consistencies as higher end brands in the same price range. To be honest, I don't feel like any of the products I have tried have been worth the pricetags at all. Eyeshadows, foundations, mascara (terrible), blush, powder ... all had the same lower quality feel and performance. I am a cosmetics and skincare junkie.  I am also a cosmetics and skincare snob, so to speak. I don't buy drug store brands and I can tell the difference between lower priced brands and the high end brands. That is not necessarily to say that all high end products are good, because they aren't, and likewise I am sure some drugstore brands are good .. I am just saying that I do not think these products by michelle phan deserve their pricetags - the quality and performance just is not there.  As for this compact specifically, I did not like how it settles into every single tiny line, especially around the eyes. I felt it could have had a more smooth finish. It really looked like it laid on top of the skin. I use Make Up For Ever liquid foundation. I've used it for years and switch up between various powders on top. I have never really had an issue with any of my other powders settling so badly. Not that I can remember, anyway.  I use a powder brush to apply and it really broke up/wore down this compact quickly. That is not good. It is the same brush that I use with my other powders and they have not worn down like this. The powders I have been using and switching between the most in the past year or so are Peter Thomas Roth, Too Faced Absolutely Invisible, Rock & Republic (not a fave though), and Dior Diorskin. These all give a nice smooth finish, without looking like you have a pile of makeup on your face. They also do not settle into fine lines and tiny creases around the eyes.  I probably wouldn't recommend this michelle phan powder unless it was clearanced out at a low price and you just wanted to try something new. Everyone has different preferences and experiences with makeup and skincare products though too, so it is possible that it may work out just fine for someone else, whereas it didn't work out well for me.	-1
Michelle Phan's "Porcelain 02" finish powder is a good, finely particled everyday powder that evenly applies and provides a lasting natural, matted finish that holds up through the course of a day/night.  Do note that "Porcelain 02" is for fairer skin but if you browse Phan's website there are plenty of skin reference photos that will help you decide if this is the right hue for you. The powder also comes in a handsomely designed, mirrored compact making this an ideal product to keep in your bag should you need a quick touch up.	1
I love, love, love this compact! This is by far the nicest and well made compact I have ever used. It is chic and opens very easily, unlike most other compacts I have tried. It has a strong magnetic closure that is very handy. I wear this "powder" as my foundation, there is no need for anything more on my skin. It goes on flawlessly and a little bit goes a long way. I'm so happy I had the chance to try it!	1
My wife loves this product!  This is the second em michelle phan product that she has tried and she liked the other one too. She said it made her face feel refreshing and helped with the foundation of her makeup. It was the perfect blend with her skin color-now my young daughter (who loves trying her mothers makeup) said it helped with all of her makeup needs-we laughed so hard!  My wife loved it and said that she will be buying some in the future!	1
I ordered the Porcelain 2 shade but received the Cafe 20 instead. It's much darker than my wife's skin tone but that's not the fault of the product anyway. The product itself is very nice. The powder is very fine and doesn't cake at all. It was easy to put on and was smooth and silky without the powdery look. Overall, it is a high quality powder.  The compact is surprisingly well made as well. It's large and solid. It has a large mirror and is held closed with two small magnets. An white sponge applicator is included. Though it's thin and could have been better made.	1
The compact is as nice as the powder.  Both are solidly made.  I ordered the shade "Porcelain" which is a light beige.  The powder, as others have noticed, does not cake.  It instead helps cover the skin evenly.  There are no brash aromas or allergens from this compact, either.  The effect lingers for several hours.  An applicator pad is enclosed in this compact.	1
This powder goes on easy, and covers well.  It has light coverage, but stays on like a liquid.  It is a heavier powder, so it doesn't brush away when applied.  The compact has a mirror, and it is a high quality compact.  I like the constancy of the powder, and the compact is really nice.  I can't tell how much you actually get, because the powder is set into the compact, so I don't know how much you get for the price.  Time will tell.  If you are willing to spend a decent chunk of money to find out, go for it.  If you are looking for a powder that stays in place like a liquid, then give this a try.  I like it, but I am going to stay with my usual&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/tarte-Amazonian-clay-12-hour-full-coverage-foundation-SPF-15/dp/B00DS5ZZFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour full coverage foundation SPF 15</a>.	1
This is a great product that my wife says is really good. It comes in a nice little compact and it works great. It goes on very easy and she said it stays on during the day without any problems.  This isn't ehst she normally wears but she would definetly use again.	1
I received this as part of the Vine program, but unfortunately it did not arrive in the shade I selected. You may notice a LOT of Vine reviews that state they received the wrong colors. Please do not be put off from ordering this product in fear that you will receive the wrong color, as the paying customer experience will not be the same as ours. We received our samples from a different lot and the colors were sent randomly to Vine members. You will receive the color you order.  I received a shade darker than I normally wear, so this is not one that I will continue to use. However, the darker shade allowed me to judge the lasting power of this face powder since I could actually see how long it lasted. First, the powder went on very smoothly and had a creamy feel to it. It wasn't shiny or too matte, and had a natural appearance that I really like. It offered good coverage and a nice finish to my foundation. The darker color gradually faded throughout the day, indicating that it was rubbing of. However, I could still see it at the end of my work day. If I was using the right shade, I would have touched up by that point before leaving the office. I felt that it offered good staying powder, and I liked the natural appearance. I will gladly order a compact in the correct shade. It costs more than I usually spend on powder, but I think it will be worth it.	1
em michelled phan Finishing Powder is great for younger women. It is a matte finishing powder and doesn't have enough luminescence for the older woman. You can  wear this finishing powder alone, over makeup or use it as a touch-up throughout the day to  blot shine.  The mirrored compact is very nice. If I hold it sideways, it reflects almost my entire face. The applicator is thin foam about 1/8" thick & will dry quickly whenever you need to wash it.  I received Bare 4 instead of Porcelain 02. I would describe Bare 4 as between light & medium ivory.	1
Provides very good, even excellent cover, but is still lightweight. It never felt heavy or caked on. It goes on smooth, easily. Takes care of shine and lasts all day. Doesn't rub off easily. The compact itself is quite sturdy and of good quality with generous mirror. Visit the Michelle Phan website and it will guide you to choosing the exact right color for your skin tone.	1
I find powder makeup works better than a liquid on skin that is prone to acne so I was excited to try this product.  I ordered "porcelain" but was sent Cafe which is much too dark for the pasty winter complexion of a Seattle-ite.  I'll have to save this to be my "summer" makeup.  It does go on nice and smooth, blends well and provides decent coverage.  The case is quite nice but easily double the size needed for the amount of product it contains.  From the look of it, about half the cost to produce the item must have gone into the disposable case.  This does allow for a big mirror but makes for considerable extra weight and bulk to carry around in your purse.  I guess they didn't understand that a "Compact" should be compact...	1
I was suppose to get porcelain, but instead got a dark color, that was way to dark for me. As this was for review, I tried it anyway. There is not as much of the powder in the product as I would have thought should be. I loved how silky it was and easy it glided on. I like it a lot better than the name brand I'm using now. I'm wanting to try it in my color, because I have a feeling it would be my new makeup! Love it!	1
This is a nice overall powder compact.  The powder goes on and blends nicely as long as I don't put on too much at a time.  It is pretty easy to put a very light layer on.  Per the packaging you can use it over makeup to seal it on, use by itself for a light cover, or use it for more detailed coverage.  It does a good job of taking care of shine throughout the day and is easy to reapply.  I like the compact, it fits nicely in my purse and has a nice sized mirror.	1
em michelle phan Love Me For Me Flawless Finish Powder Compact, Porcelain 02  I got this product thinking the color would be good for my mom, who I care for. Well I learned something. Some fine make up powders are too fine for older skin. She liked the product thought the case was very modern and worked well. Over all her thoughts were very positive but just not the right product. I cant blame the product it is of very good quality.	1
(Bad news, the VINE color was supposed to be "porcelain" but instead I received "cafe" which just means I cannot comment on color.) Now, here's what I can tell you! The product arrives in a box, which reminds me of most higher end makeup products you can purchase at department stores, it looks nice and professional. I love the cursive words imprinted on the box, "embrace, embody...etc" it has that "cool" vibe. The powder container is a sqare compact, actually large and slightly heavy. But it has an awesome mirror with it and small magnets that open/hold it closed that are a great touch. The powder applicator/pad was slightly thin, I didn't like it, but it serves the purpose. The powder (again, I can't commebt on color) but the powder goes on really smooth and easy. I loved that it "feels" like powder but doesn't "look" like powder once on. I looked ridiculous with this on but used it around the house. I did not notice a shine on my face after 5 hours, and sometimes with my current powder I need a touch up and I didn't appear to need it with this. Because the color was to an extreme of not matching it worked great to look for places this might have rubbed off easy, or places that might have dis colored. In this case I noticed that it stayed put and still looked pretty good 7 hours in. At that point I touched it up (again, not a fan of the flimsy pad) but it touched up nicely. Another 3 hours in I took it off with regular face cleanser and still felt it looked good, not powdery, not shiny! I only wish I could have had a skin match, but besides the flimsy pad, this was really good, especially the mirror, case, and the fact that it covers great without a powdery finish!	1
This powder from EM and Michelle Phan is a silky finishing powder.  It will give you a nice matte finish and will help set foundation.  WHAT YOU GET is a compact with mirror and sponge applicator.  The outside of the applicator is embossed, which is nice, but if your like the fluffy kind of pillow applicator you are going to want to swap out.  I found a little went a long way and I liked the silky texture which is actually finer than the usual powder I wear.  The price seems a bit high.  SUMMARY One of the things I actually didn't like about this makeup was the compact.  Whereas the EM&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pillow-Plush-Cushiony-Lip-Balm/dp/B00GXLGMVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pillow Plush Cushiony Lip Balm</a>&nbsp;comes in a cute little jar with a raised cap, this compact, in comparison, is not cute and is in fact rather dull.  It's white with a clear plastic cover and though it has the logo, it isn't evocative of anything --despite having the words 'embrace', 'empower', etc. on it. Mostly because you can't make them out. They're nearly invisible.  It does however come in a nice box, but it's less giftable, in my opinion than some of the other parts of the line.  As for the powder I think it's for younger women and girls.  The very fine nature of the powder and the fact that it gives an entirely matte finish, isn't going to look good on most older women as it is going to creep into fine lines and make our dryer skin look less radiant.  Which would be me.  Other than that, it's a nice product, although a bit pricey.	1
I love the way this goes on and the way it feels.  The Porcelain 2 is perfect for my color as I am quite light.  I would really love to give the foundation a try but will wait until after the holidays are over with to see if maybe one of my girls might have taken the hint to buy it for me.  You only need just a light pat so this should last quite some time and the compact is really rugged and beautiful.  I have tried some shadows prior to this and love them so this was a natural pick when I was offered.	1
This is a sheer to light creamy type of powder, that you can use as a light dusting with a brush or build up layers with a sponge for greater coverage without that chalky effect that some brands have to them when you use multiple layers. I also found that it is wonderful for indoor lighting pictures, it photographs great under fluorescent light or flash pictures without your face looking lighter/grayish or "ghost like" when heavier makeup has been applied.  It is more of a light setting type of powder in comparison to a foundation powder, it leaves a smooth matte finish that lasts for me (I have dry skin and am 56 years old) for a good 6+ hours, my friend who (is 35 years old) has more oily skin, finds that her oils on her face tend to break through the powder at about 4/5 hours but  touch ups can easily bring it back to a fresh look in seconds. If you use a primer it will last  much longer than if /when you don't.  The sponge applicator that comes with it is great for touch ups but for the initial application I have others I prefer. This does not highlight your pore size but smooths over them without caking.  On a negative (for me) note, it does not have any spf in it or I would give it 5 stars, I love anything that takes a step out of my daily makeup routine!  It also is a great primer for light days swept over your skin after using a tinted moisturizer (*with spf in it).  Also on a positive note, I dropped mine on the concrete and it did not break all apart! Yay! After that I looked into it and found it is pressed, not baked. However they press it I am very pleased that it did not shatter apart!  I also like the selection of shades, they have a greater variety than most. I tend to use 2 and either add more of the darker or lighter one depending on if it is summer or winter.	1
NIce shade. Thanks Amazon for carrying such great variety of products. WELL DONE	1
Some days I literally leave for school while it's dark and return much later ... when a new darkness has settled in. To say that I occasional need a long-wearing product is something of an understatement. This product did not have the longevity for which I had hoped. (But, that is an awful lot to ask from a product). Likewise, the more I tinkered with this, the more I realized that all I really need is a light, long-wearing concealer for under my eyes. For me, this was excess. However, it may be just exactly what another person needs.  While all aspects of this did not apply to my lifestyle, I can easily see how a person may very well make use of this entire palette (especially on a date-night or for a special photo, etc.)	1
I am a busy person. Quite frankly, I don't have time every day to "tweak" my makeup. I need something that works for me every time and not just when I get the mix just right.  Another thing is that I have oily skin and no matter how I mix, apply and try to set this concealer, it doesn't stay very well and no matter how much time I put into playing with it, trying to get the shade just right, it just plain does NOT cover my dark under eye circles. I can buy something from a dept store chain that costs 5 smackers that works better than this.  Sorry to be so negative. I gave this 2 stars because the compact is nice but I really don't think this is going to sell well. Who wants to pay this much for a compact that contains colors they'll never use and will just go to waste? Not me.	-1
Normally I don't go for a concealer palette because I've had bad experiences in the past because I'm so pale and the shades in the palette are always too dark, however, Michelle Phan's palette turned out to be a pleasant surprise. All of the concealers are usable and can be mixed together to create the perfect shade for your skin. The packaging itself is nice and travel friendly, and even has a mixing well to create your own colors. The concealers are long lasting and don't settle into fine lines, too. I recommend it, especially if you're a fan of Michelle Phan.	1
Well, this is perfect for me. Nice smooth, blend-able, and long-lasting color.  I have dark circles and age spots.  The concealers in this palette are many, but I see it as having more control over my make-up. There are dark to light circles of shades, and values of skin colors. There is a larger circle of the lightest color in this compact. I know it is tempting to use one overall color of concealer.  We all need to spend our time wisely.  Since I am an art student and love to paint, when I have gone out I have applied different colors to different areas of the face for a more chiseled look. First I applied lightest value to my dark circles, and worked with other colors as well in that area to reduce a "skier" look. (too much light under the eyes.)  I neutralized my age spots and circles as I learned the different effects I could accomplish.  I watched a You Tube video on how to get that high cheekbone look, complete with making shadows and highlights, and that is how I use this compact.  For special occasions.  Too lazy for everyday use. Recommended for Kim Kardashian makeover.	1
From the wife: This is a great  all season concealer once you learn how to use it.  I feel it's not for a person who is a novice on make up.  I had to seek the help of a knowledgeable friend to  use it.  This concealer is is made up of a total of five pans. Here's the breakdown. Main Pan - this your main concealer Small Pan (lower left) - this a shade darker than you main concealer Small Pan (upper left) - this is a shade lighter than your main concealer   * these are used to customize the shade of your main concealer as your skin changes through the seasons Small Pan (upper right) - yellow corrector, use this to cover red spots and blemishes Small Pan (lower right) -  peach highlighter,  to highlight your brow bone, nose bridge & cheek bones Empty pan - to mix your concealer when customizing  The peach neutralizer did help in lightening my under eye dark circles, I put it after putting the main concealer. This really works once you learn how to apply it properly and it takes time and practice.  I took out one star because you need to have a little more make up skills to maximize the use of this concealer palette.  Good luck!	1
Michelle Phan is ultra talented when it comes to make up. This palette of Shade Play Concealer has a lot of potential, especially if you like to play around with different make-up styles, if you do-you will love this item. My basic knowledge is simple but I still like the potential of this compack, especially when I have time to play around with different effects. I like the overall formula of this concealor/makeup. It's very smooth and goes on very easily. The larger pot of make-up you can use as a pore reducing foundation, and a little goes a long way-you can add the other colors for make, or up mix up different shades for the perfect concealor.  I have watched some of Michelle's videos in the past and I love the way she can do anything with make-up. This palette has the potential to create shading and light and different techniques. There is a little brush included in the kit and there is an empty well to mix the colors. This is a fun product to play around with. The make-up is long lasting and does have a nice feeling-too much can be heavy.  The compact itself is nice. It includes a nice sized mirror and a small mixing brush. I also just use my finger to apply this concealer. The amounts included are okay-small pots but a little goes a long way but if you mix a lot of product at one time, it probably won't last long-except for the larger pot. The larger pot of color is a little dark-there is one light, light shade and then the others are dark, but you can mix the different colors for whatever effect you'd like.  People who love to play with make-up will probably really like this product.	1
Good combination of palette. Thanks Amazon for carrying this product	1
Relatively inexpensive foundation compared to up market brands, in a nice carry case. The foundation requires some delicate mixing to get the perfect shade for your face, but you will notice how easily it mixes. Extremely soft to the touch and blends very quickly and easily with the finger or supplied applicator. Probably doesn't stack up to brands like Clinique or Estee Lauder, but for the price is a nice and convenient carry case that you can slip into your purse for that last minute touch up. Seems to last through the day OK after a morning application. Makes a nice stocking filler gift idea with Christmas not far away.	1
I have several age spots on the backs of my hands and this concealer hid them well. I was able to mix the colors to match perfectly, then painted a dab on each area, rubbing it in gently. The same for blemishes on my face. Age spots and spider veins disappeared under the concealer as though they had never been there. I'm going to be using this product for a long, long time.  The best thing about it, is the ability to mix and match your palate until it fits your skin tones.  I've used concealers before, but never with this success.  Two Thumbs Up!	1
There comes a time in life when everyone needs a little cover-up. I always preferred the natural look, so only ever wore a touch of powder to take the shine off... But now I got this product to cover a few red spots that have crept up on my face through the years.  I will never use all these shades and won't bother to blend a few. I am fair, so a few of them are perfect the way they are. So far I have found that two shades are ok for covering my facial blemishes, while two others are perfect for covering the age spots on my hands.  For those reasons alone, I am pleased with this product. Also I like the way it feels: creamy and silky. I just apply a dab of powder and that seems to "set" it so I don't have to worry about it rubbing off too quickly.  I do love the sleek style and the smaller size of this mixing palette. If I'm going to be gone longer than a day, it fits in my purse easily.  A cool product for my limited purposes.  I would give it five stars, but since some of it will go to waste (due to some shades being unsuitable...too dark...for me) I must give it a four. Also it is expensive compared to some other brands I've tried.  Reviewed by Betty Dravis, August 9, 2014 Author of "1106 Grand Boulevard"	1
The concept behind this seems awesome, but in reality, it didn't work particularly well for my fair skin. While mixing your own color combination seems great in theory, in practice, it just complicates the process and doesn't really result in a better concealer. It also means that you have to experiment nearly every time to figure out which combinations work. It's more troublesome for an inferior outcome.  Also, though I love the design of the compact (I especially love the way it apes a small art palette), mine came with the center detached and stuck to the mirror. The glue on the bottom of it didn't stick and an enormous smudge was left on the mirror. There is a protective film on the mirror when you first get it, but my guess is that, unless this is stored flat, that center bit will come unstuck again and it'll smear the mirror.  Given the cost of this make-up, I would hope that it would be better constructed and that the concept would work a bit better. Maybe it's just me and I'm bad at such mixing, but I don't think you should have to be a make-up expert to use the product effectively.	-1
This is a very silky, creamy textured concealer that allows you to mix shades to conceal blemishes with a nearly perfect match to your skin tone, provided you do your part to get the color mix proper. It does a good job at concealing minor blemishes, but darker spots will shine through with ease. As the day wears on, this concealer doesn't really wear off (if you are active and sweat a lot or in a high humidity area, all bets are off as this will slide right off your face quickly), so it does provide a level of confidence throughout the day in a typical office environment. Those will oily skin such as mine might have a little more trouble getting it to conceal, as it doesn't seem to want to have any staying power as the skin's oils build up throughout the day.  Overall it's a nice product, but it isn't a miracle product. I'd say it's on par with most well known drug store brands.	1
What I like about this shade palette is that it suits any skin color and skin type. Some of the features are as follows:- 1) It has different shades designed for specific skin tones. 2) It is easy to use. The face perfector smoothens the pores and helps the makeup to glide on without any difficulty. 3) The customized palette helps one mix and blend a personalized shade as per one's requirement and mood. 4) The brow liner helps to shape the eyebrows I have not found any negatives of this product as yet.	1
Im a mature woman and I have considerable puffiness below the eyes.  I am also fair skinned and I have been trying to reduce the puffiness by changing my diet but in the meantime I want to cover it up or make it less noticeable.  I thought this palette would be perfect, and as Ive dabbled in painting and know a little about highlighting and shadows, I thought this would work for me.  So I watched a few YouTube videos on correcting the under-the-eye puffiness with concealer and they say to highlight the shadows that the puffiness creates not the actual puffy part which made so much sense I couldn't believe I hadnt thought of that.  And that trick does work!  However I wound up using only one color of the palette, even though I had a few choices to work with.  But without the palette, I might not have discovered which color actually worked for me.  Doing a bit of research on getting the most out of your concealer,  I found out you should apply a powdered foundation first, then you will need a setting powder after applying the concealer.  And, since I have wrinkles, I have to be careful and not get concealer in the lines because it really magnifies them.  If you watch the videos on the EM web site, the model they use for showcasing their products is very young, so watching her put on makeup on flawless skin is a bit depressinglol.  I think the palette combination is a clever idea and I love the compact because the mirror is large compared to most compacts Ive owned  The  concealer cream has no noticeable perfumes that I could detect so it won't take your breath away if you are sensitive to that like I am. I don't care for the brush because I think it concentrates the cream in too small of an area and so I would recommend buying a larger one.  I just use my finger.	1
This concealer helps conceal my acne dark circles and sun spots. The various shades in the kit help color correct so the concealer stays transparent under my foundation. I ordered fair but actually need a slightly darker shade with my summer tan. I would definitely consider buying this kit again. I feel like it is quality make up at a reasonable price considering all of the color options in the kit.	1
Nice peach color, brightens us the face. Thanks Amazon for carrying this items.	1
This concealer kit was difficult to apply, and badly packaged. I struggled to get the product neatly from it's pan and when I applied it, the colors didn't work well as concealers. They were kind of goopy and didn't blend well with foundations. As well they had an odd texture, they reminded me of makeup you buy a child. Sorry to say such because I really looked forward to the face products!	-1
My face poses what may be called a dermatologic challenge:  I'm on the wrong side of middle age, with a history of sun exposure (growing up in southern California at a time people didn't know the dangers of tanning), and the resultant skin cancers and sun damage have left me with wrinkles, scars, blotchiness, and uneven coloring.  So I was eager to try the em michelle phan Great Cover Up.  Here's what I like about it:  1.) It's not overly thick or annoying.  It goes on think, with a powdery feel.  2.) It does an excellent job of covering up a wide range of facial problems.  I have two large circular scars on my face that are quite white compared to my skin.  The phan product doesn't conceal them entirely, but it does a wonderful job of making them less obvious.  I know they're there, because I look for them, but a casual viewer wouldn't notice them.  The cover up works very well on all my other facial flaws... dark circles, uneven toning, etc.  3.)  While it's best to apply this in conjunction with foundation and/or other makeup, it works all right by itself in a pinch.  I'm a minimalist when it comes to makeup (most days wearing none at all), and I'm usually not in the mood to spend a lot of time putting on a dozen different products.  So if there are times I just want to tone down the scars or make the dark circles under my eyes less obvious, I can put on this concealer and not deal with the rest of the hassle.  The only downside that I discovered is that the concealing benefits don't last all that long.  If I put it on in the morning, the scars etc. are obvious by afternoon.  That's possibly a function of the humid southeastern summers I was testing this product out in. Bottom line:  If I'm going out later in the evening, I'd want to reapply this, or wait until shortly before leaving.	1
Too Oily for my fair skin. I am blonde and fair skin and was hoping this would be the perfect concealer that I have been searching for. It applies smoothly enough and does not smudge and really does a good job of blending with my skin tone but it leaves my skin too shiny and by the end of the day it just feels ick almost like it is caked on or like chalk just a strange texture for me. It is not a good product for under the eyes because it will actually enhance every little wrinkle. Is good for blemishes  or dark spots. If you just need a little for a quick touch up now and then it is ok.	-1
This concealer  works well enough.  It goes on smoothly, but is a bit chalky when dry.  When enough is applied to truly conceal permanent dark circles under the eyes, it tends to look caked on and the texture is rather noticeable.  It would be okay for occasional use for a small blemish or the occasional raccoon eyes from lack of sleep.  It is somewhat difficult to get the right tone without testing it, so keep that in mind, as well.	1
My heritage is Irish, English, and Austrian. My skin isn't just fair ... it's crazy fair. As a teen, I had a great deal of trouble finding a foundation and concealer that didn't translate as vampiric or traffic-cone orange. Back-in-the-day, Macy's steered me toward Channel foundation and Sephora showed me the wonders of Bare Minerals. Both are perfection (one a dewy finish, the other matte). To this very day, I alternate them depending on mood or moisture needs. Now, I have tried a few new products (especially since I am trying to go a little more natural and that means eliminating the Channel). I recently bought Ole Henriksen Perfect Truth(tm) CC Crme Broad Spectrum SPF 30 (becuase I LOVE that entire line and it is completely natural). Well, it made me look insane. When I say "orange," I mean "ORANGE!" This new "em" product pretty much had the same results. Moreover, it was so oily, that I worried it may not be compatible with contact lens (I feared it may migrate and sully the lens).  For now, it seems that I will be sticking with Channel (and Bare Minerals). Both lines cater to fair-skinned women and both lines are "tried and true." As it stands, this concealer may need to be "revamped." I look forward to trying this product again once it has been reformulated.	-1
The concealer is packed in a tiny tube, smaller then a lipstick, but it looks like it is going to last for a long time - you only need a tiniest bit of it to cover the entire area. It goes on smoothly, and the very thin layer covers any spots really nice. My skin is very sensitive and I have rosacea, and so far I didn't get any breakouts from the concealer, which is rare occurrence for me.	1
It seems I'm on a constant search for a quality under eye concealer. I have very fair skin and constant dark circles. I've tried expensive products (like Smashbox) and $10 and under drug store products (Cover Girl, Maybelline, etc.). I'd say this product is comparable in quality to a drug store product with the price of an expensive brand.  The product does go on very smoothly, and I think it will last a long time--a little bit goes a long way. But as far as coverage goes, it doesn't last through the day. For the last several days, I've applied my Cover Girl stick under one eye and the em cover up under the other eye. The em has a more yellow tinge, but once I put my foundation over it, the yellow disappears. By noon, the dark circles are completely back. I've come to expect it from a cheap product, but from a product that's nearly $20? That's unacceptable. Why would I pay twice the price to have the same result?  I had been very interested in trying Michelle Phan's makeup line, but this product does not make me want to try any of her other products.	-1
This is a nice concealer. The texture is creamy and light, but it still covers problem areas. I'm pleased that it comes in a tube, because it keeps contaminants to an absolute minimum -- a great feature for a product that will be worn next to your eyes. I received  this concealer through the Vine program. Although I was supposed to be sent color "Fair Neutral/Cool", I received "the neutralizer" instead.  I'm pale, and I typically wear the second lightest color sold in any makeup line, so "the neutralizer" was a bit dark for my skin tone. Even so,it worked better than I thought it would when I saw the color in the tube. I attribute this to how well it blends. I would buy a lighter color next time, but that's the only change I'd make.	1
em michelle phan The Great Cover Up Ultimate Concealer is the best concealer I have used to date.  I have tried several big name products such as Dior and Lancome, among others, and this works much better than those.  The color is a perfect tone for my skin.  It blends in fast and has great coverage.  It is very light weight, and non-greasy.  And it stays on too.  I have sensitive skin and I have had no issues. I will make this product a regular purchase.	1
This is creamy and spreads easily with my fingers.  I can't quite figure out the top, though.  It is shaped like a lip protector tube, but it's hard to squeeze out the amount you need using the applicator.  I just wiped it off with my finger and applied.  It covered my spots pretty well and disappeared enough so it didn't look like I was wearing it.  I got the fair neutral/cool and have medium fair skin, but lots of sun spots and a red nose.  This product was just right for covering the majority of my "maturity marks" as my dermatologist calls them.	1
This product did work to cover the bags under my eyes, although I would say the coloring is more for beige than fair, and I liked it the first day I wore it, even if I do think the bottle is WAY too small for the amount of money charged, but the next day I HATED it. Why? Beacuse my eye was swollen, red, painful and started having discharge. YUCK!! I don't remember getting any in my eye but some must have and I got an eye infection from this stuff. For that reason, if you have sensitive eyes like I do, I can't recommend!	-1
Being born blonde is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because you have fabulous hair color and a curse because it probably means you have pale skin. I've been searching for the perfect concealer - a concealer that would hide the dark circles under my eyes. I've tried them all - Lancome, Cover Girl, Rimmel, MAC, Dior. My extensive and exhausting market search has lead me to some hits and some misses.  I am sorry to say that Em by Michelle Phan's The Great Cover Up made my MISS LIST.  Here's why: *  The product is oily.  You know when you get a really good slice of New York style pepperoni pizza and you lift the first piece from the pie and all of that delicious but deadly orange grease drips off the pointy end of the slice?  This cover up is almost as bad as that.  When I first opened and squeezed the tube, a huge drop of orange-ish oil came out. *  The lightest shade looked very orangy on my skin.  I mean, like MUPPET orange. *  $17 seems a bit steep for what is essentially a L'Oreal product. *  For $2 more, I would rather purchase MAC's coverup.  No oil.  Nice colors.  ANOTHER BIG REASON: *  Although I looked all over their website, I could not find where these products are manufactured.  I have a stringent no makeup manufactured in CHINA policy.  Now, I am NOT saying this product is manufactured in China.  What I am saying is this:  I typed "manufactured" and "made" into their nifty "Ask a Question" box and all I got back was: we do not test on animals.	-1
As a Vine reviewer, I'm an external third party and have an open mind to trying this concealer/cover up: I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, I like it a bit more than 3 stars and a bit less than 4 stars. My thoughts: it conceals very well under the eyes, as it seems to contain a bit of that yellow-y pigment that works so well for under eye concealers; it does feel a bit greasy, and it's not at the top of my list of favorite overall concealers (there are some great options out there in the same price range), I would certainly use it as I dabbed a small amount under my eyes and on a blemish, it blended well, stayed all day and did not cake up: I covered it with a bit of mineral powder, which seemed to also blend fairly smoothly: all in all, I like it fine.	1
Great Perfume	-1
I'm usually a fan of fruity or floral perfumes, but this sweet scent has me hooked.  Viva La Juicy Gold Couture has a vanilla-caramel scent.  I don't get much honeysuckle, amber, or wild berry, but this could be giving the fragrance just enough complexity that I'm not overwhelmed by the sweetness.  I find that a couple of light spritzes will get me going in the morning.  I don't like a fragrance that announces me or that remains in a room after I leave.  Viva La Juicy Gold Couture stays close, so only those who get near will know I'm wearing it.  The bottle may be a bit of an over the top statement, but the fragrance is subtle and sophisticated.	1
This is a great choice for those that like the sugary/vanilla scents like Pink Sugar.  Personally on me it didn't have too much of the berry or amber notes and mostly smelled vanilla and caramel but each person will differ.  My husband isn't keen on the sweet scents so he wasn't a fan but I did get quite a few compliments when out including that I smelled like a cupcake LOL.  Overall it's a good perfume that lasts a decent amount of time and isn't one that set off my allergies, win!	1
I am loving this perfume! I couldn't quite pick up what it smelled like, so I looked at the other reviews to see if anyone else knew. supposedly it is a caramel-vanilla scent. Which may explain why I like it. I love anything that smells like food! It is not too strong of a scent, that's good for me because I have allergies and lots of perfumes I simply cannot wear or stand to have anyone else wear it around me. You will think that it has worn off, but people always seem to get a whiff of it as you pass or in the wind. They will stop you. MEN especially love this fragrance. I walked into a store and the ladies started talking about smelling pies lol. Reminded me of the movie Michael that John Travolta was in!  luscious wild berries, a kiss of honeysuckle and a luxurious elixir of golden amber, melted caramel, and vanilla. description from Ulta:	1
As background, I rarely wear perfume, and prefer Bath and Body Works cream instead, but was intrigued by the description of this perfume.  Here's a description of the scent of this Juicy Couture Gold Couture Eau de Parfum according to the manufacturer:  Glamorous, Golden Composition  Viva La Juicy Gold Couture opens with luscious wild berry notes and deepens to a heart of sambac jasmine and honeysuckle. A sensual base of melted caramel, vanilla cream, praline, and sandalwood combine to create a warm finish.  Top: wild berries, gardenia, muguet  Mid: vanilla orchid, honeysuckle, and jasmine sambac  Bottom: sandalwood, melted caramel, vanilla cream, and praline  I really like this perfume, but I don't catch the top notes at all, primarily what I experience is the bottom notes of sandalwood, melted caramel and amber (which is not mentioned).  The scent is pronounced but not overpowering and lasts.  It is a sophisticated scent, not a bright floral or fruit.  The eau de perfume comes in a very heavy bottle that looks like it is lined in a gold foil.  The "crystal" on top is plastic.  All in all, it makes a nice presentation.	1
Great impact but quick to fade! This is most definitely not a fragrance for the unsophisticated. Something about it is so seductive. I wore just a touch before I left the house and a few people kept asking me what it was, because they wanted to buy it either for themselves or for a girlfriend. Lovely packaging, definitely a super nice gift. I toyed with the idea of deducting a star for the fast fade, but decided it was just too good! I sprayed one drop on my wrists, and I can't stop smelling it right now. I don't know all the ingredients, but Juicy Couture is a real trip!! :)	1
My favorite fragrances tend to fall into two broad categories - rich oriental spices or masculine scents with notes of cedar, tobacco and/or leather.  Even in the summer, I don't gravitate toward lighter perfumes that are fruit or floral forward.  Therefore, I was hesitant to give this one a go, since the top note is berry.  But the list of base-notes (sandalwood, musk) intrigued me enough to go for it.  Upon first applying, the ultra-sweet berry is very prominent, which was a big turn-off.  To me, it smelled a bit juvenile and cheap.  But after a couple of minutes, it dried down to a very warm, sophisticated scent as the base-notes came to the front.  My husband commented that the fragrance was very sexy.  Plus it has real staying power (sillage, as it's called in the industry), which is a big selling point because even some of the most expensive perfumes can fade away after an hour or so.  My only real complaint is the packaging.  It's extremely gaudy - the gold bottle, the mesh bow and the pink plastic Juicy Couture logo - it's all a bit much.  But you can't always judge a book by it's cover.  This is an exceptional fragrance and a very good price.	1
I was skeptical about the vanilla scent and the "juicy" descriptive name. But it's a fine perfume. It's actually a sexy perfume, and that's not something I'd say about many perfumes.  This complex scent hints of a sophisticated female vampire. It's not like female pheromones but rather a seductive foreign physical presence combined with an undead voice - really messes with one's head. I don't know if one is meant to be consumed by the wearer or if it's the other way around.	1
Overall, this is a good, bright perfume that isn't too sweet. Fortunately, unlike other Juicy Couture perfumes, it doesn't have overpowering sillage. In other words, you won't find yourself enveloped in an offensively strong, one-note smell.  When first applied, it has a strong, sharp smell that's disappointly like the cheap fake floral perfumes I avoid. However, it quickly calms to a warm, gently spicy floral with sandalwood and amber notes.  It lasts about four hours, and even then it isn't completely faded - just noticeably more difficult to pick up.  It's suitable (in my opinion) for day and evening wear. Because it isn't particularly sweet, it'll work for any age range, as well.  I'm very pleased and plan to wear it often. Definitely recommended.	1
This is a pretty nice parfum.  It is not overpowering and as I guy and I honestly say this is one of my favorite scents.  It is definitely head turning.  It is actually pretty light yet you know when someone is wearing it.  Whoever created this scent knew what a guy would like.  It is a lightly sweet, citrus smell with vanilla undertones.  It lasts for a while and I personally think it gets better as the hour wears on.  Price is a little high but if you want something good sometimes you have to pay for it.  Good perfume isn't cheap.  If you are a man or a woman sometimes you have to spend a few more dollars for something nice.  I will definitely be spending the cash for this in the future when this bottle runs out.  All in all this is a really nice Parfum.  It is well worth the money and I will have no problem getting more fin the future.	1
Love this scent. I cannot get enough. This is my second bottle this year!	1
This is an amazing shampoo for my thick, straight and long hair! I was using Morrocan Oil products for 5years and I love the Oribe Gold Lust products better! I ordered the Gold Lust Repair & Restore Onditioner also. Not too many salons carry this product and Neiman Marcus carries this also!	1
Love it	1
I luv oribe but this product is horrible. Wonder if it's authentic	-1
Excellent shampoo. The fragrance is amazing. More importantly it thoroughly cleanses my hair with out stripping it. I find one deep shampoo sufficient. My hair is smooth, shiny and bouncy.	1
good	1
dries the crap out of your hair. not worth it at all. wouldnt use it if it was free	-1
nothing special. it feels like T/gel shampoo, only smell better.	-1
Hands down the best shampoo. It leaves my hair clean without over drying it!	1
I have used what seems to be EVERY shampoo on the market from the cheap stuff you can buy at the local store to the exclusive expensive salon exclusives. When I first researched premium shampoos this came up on every search, and as always I was skeptical to purchase as I did not want it to go to the shampoo graveyard under my sink. I have VERY thick and long hair that is frizzy and unmanageable. If I let my hair air dry normally it will look like a huge fluff ball. When I received this shampoo I was excited to try it immediately. First use was like day and night, my hair was soft, NOT frizzy for the first time ever upon air drying. Smell is excellent and you only need a small amount. I only use a nickel size amount of the shampoo. A little really does go a long way. I have paired this with the matching conditioner. Now my hair is so easy to manage and looks like I received a blowout every time I use it. I also use the ORIBE Shampoo for Beautiful Color as well as that conditioner. My color has stayed in for 10 weeks while using this so far. I am so impressed with the shampoo and other ORIBE products that I have thrown away everything under the sink! These products are WELL worth EVERY penny and even more! Excellent and a must try for any hair type.	1
Love this stuff. Won't buy anything else	1
LOVE this stuff. Hair feels amazing after. little goes a long way and concentrate on the root areas more.	1
I will never use any other shampoo or conditoner again great hair every day! Not a fan of any of the Oribe products but this shampoo and conditoner makes my hair feel and look like silk!	1
I usually don't write reviews on shampoo and conditioner but I felt compled to after using this product. My hair is thin but I have a lot of it and heavy blond highlights which is alittle past my bra strap I'm growing it out alittle more I have been hooked on Lanza healing oil shampoo and conditioner for 2 years now but after a recent visit to an upscale salon store I cringed at the price of this but figured it was worth a try for my hairs sake!  This is truly a gem combined with the conditioner my hair feels light and airy like when I have the salon blow it out it smells amazingly fresh my hair is soft and styled really great! This is expensive stuff but it's well worth the price of looking like I just got a blow out every day!!! I can't wait to see the long term effects of this product!	1
On time and I love it.	1
I gave this five stars because this stuff is Amazing .Really made a huge difference in my hair .Repaired the Frizz I battle with and repaired the dry ends,they are not split because I just had a trim but we're very dry from using a flat iron. This along with the conditioner has worked wonders for my hair. I never use one product to long I like to switch now and than so when I come back to the product it works as,well as the first use. I ordered several shampoos and products from oribe and trying to figure out the one best suited for my hair,so far the ones I have used I like so I will be a tough decision. This Shampoo really does what it says but everyone's hair is different what works for some may not for others. This leaves a brilliant  shine also.	1
Best shampoo ever! you don't need very much. I wash my long hair every day and 1 bottle lasts almost 2 months.	1
LORAC... beautiful, buttery blendability as always. This is a versatile little palette and it has a lot of cool (some colors are neutral in that they are not too cool or too warm either) toned neutrals so that it won't be left out of your rotation of regulars (although there are one or two colors that don't get as much love, it's certainly worth the value) . For reference I have fair skin with Neutral to slightly cool undertones, blue-grey to aqua-blue eyes (depending on the lighting) and dark ash blonde hair. Hope this helps!	1
I love this palette, the shades are very neutral.  This palette is perfect for wearing to work.  The quality seems to the same as any other Lorac palette.  The shades are highly pigmented, and the texture is creamy with very little fall out.  I think this has a nice mix of matte and shimmer shades.  I hope she puts out more palettes like this one.  At 15 dollars this is a steal.	1
I am really enjoying this little guy! I have been looking for something smaller than the average urban decay naked palette ( size wise) to travel with. I would give is 5 stars but for me 5/5 would be my perfect palette, and this is not. The quality is amazing (as to be expected). They are very buttery, blend well and highly pigmented. But for me this isn't the only palette I would have to bring with me if I were traveling (which is why I wanted this palette.) For me personally it is messing a shimmery taupe grey and a golden champagne shade. I find traveling wish a massive palette a waste of space and always on the hunt for a smaller palette that meets all my needs. This is as close as I have come. I do not regret this purchase at all, perfected for those that love that golden/glowing goddess look. Which I myself love. And for a high end brand this was a steal at only 15$!	1
as usual, its hard to go wrong with Lorac. Great little palette, highly pigmented!	1
This is the second MEG21 product I've tried and I am still very impressed with it.  It doesn't take much of this Smooth Radiance Face Treatment to cover your face, and over applying can lead to it looking heavy and greasy.  That said, as long as you use just a small amount, it goes on smoothly, smells great and has been non-irritating to my skin.  The main active ingredient, supplamine, is a combination of two aminos that work together to treat glycation. Glycation is a major cause of skin aging, and is cause by sugars attaching to collagen and elastic, creating inflammation and less resilient skin. Supplamine not only prevents the toxic sugars from being made, but it also works to neutralize existing toxic sugars.	1
This is a fast absorbing, light feeling, moisturizer that, after 30 days of regular use, left my skin softer, firmer, and more radiant. I really liked that it didn't have much scent, just a mild pleasantly neutral odor.  The pump styled applicator on the top of the jar ensures just the right amount and keeps contamination to a minimum. As a former skin care consultant, I know a little about how this product works and what was reasonable for results.  A skincare routine must have at least a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer designed to work together.  Mixing and matching or using just one as a stand alone product won't give you full benefit of the product. With that in mind, In order to evaluate this product properly, I either  purchased or requested through Vine, the other pieces.  I then used it faithfully twice a day, every day for 30 days.  I can tell you it works.  Your results may vary ( after my testing period I tended to lapse on the twice daily routine.). I highly recommend this.	1
The results Ive experienced so far from this skin cream are not as remarkable as those suggested by the manufacturer, but I have hope and am going to continue using it. Since I am older and have a lot of sun damage, my skin may not improve at the average rate. Cant hold that against the cream. MEG 21s claims to improve skin are based upon a link between toxic sugars and skin aging. They say that the discovery by their team of research scientists at a major medical center in Philadelphia was made while studying the complications of diabetes. They assert that they invented Supplamine to inhibit these toxic sugars and that consumers will see visible improvement to our skin after 4-6 weeks of using it. So far, just short of four weeks, I havent.  I do like the packaging and the way it is dispensed to avoid oxidation. The second ingredient, lecithin, is considered to be excellent for aging skin. Most of the next half dozen are good and fairly standard for quality face creams (propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, behenyl alcohol, cyclopentasiloxane, cacao butter, ceteareth-20). The ones that make this cream distinctive are the arginine HCl and methylglucamine HCl, which form part of the Supplamine.  I could find very little information about the Supplamine beyond the patent application itself (if you're interested, a web search for its title "Dermal delivery of n-methyl-glucamine and n-methyl-glucamine compounds" will turn it up).  Initially, I found the scent overwhelming. By now, I am used to it, but I would have preferred that the fragrance ingredients be omitted. The fragrance certainly doesnt do a thing for skin and, given the scientific and medical background of the researchers behind the cream, I would have expected them to leave it out. In fact, its inclusion causes me to question the scientific claims, so for me its counterproductive. There are at least four scent ingredients (parfum, hexyl cinnamal, hydroxycitronellal, and linalool) and one of them appears in the 19th position from the end of the ingredients list, so is possibly included at a higher concentration (given FDA requirements for ingredients disclosures, position in the list is not indicative of specific percentage included). EWG doesnt like any of these, nor does Paula Begoun of Beautypedia. Most importantly, neither do I.  Also, for those who are avoiding certain preservatives, there are a lot of them, including four parabens.  A June 27, 2005 newspaper article by Susan FitzGerald from the Philadelphia Inquirer titled From cancer research, smooth skin reports the background of the company and the development of the MEG 21 product line. It is helpful, but not as enlightening as I would have hoped.  The proof as they say is in the pudding and Im not at that point yet, so I think 4 stars is appropriate until I see real results on my own skin. I will have to update in a month or so.	1
I actually see small changes in my skin, which is surprising, since I see myself everyday and don't spend a lot of time looking in the mirror.  I don't like how this product is packaged though.  There's a disk you press and some cream is released, but you can't see how full the jar is.  If you loved this item, you wouldn't know when to purchase a new one until you finished using it.  I prefer using either tubes, or open jars.  Otherwise, I was happy with this product.	1
Very concentrated so you don't need a lot. Feels light on the face. Has a bit of a scent I can't quite describe, not necessarily unpleasant but just 'there', might be a bit of a chemical smell but it depends on the person. It probably will not be enough to stop you from using it. Not sure about the whole airless thing. I think that would be a waste of money and this stuff is pretty pricey already. Because it goes such a long way I guess it would be worth the price as it does feel nice on the skin.	1
The first great thing I noticed about this cream is its jar. After removing the pull-off top, there is a white disc that covers the product completely. When you push down on it, the correct amount of treatment comes up through the little spout in the center of the disc. When you let go of the white disc, all that is on the white disc is the correct, pre-measured amount of treatment. I love this, because, for one, the entire product is not contaminated each time you scoop some treatment out. Also, this prevents the treatment from drying out, as creams often do. In addition, you get the correct amount each time, with no waste.  This product is very light and is absorbed into the skin as soon as it is applied. Consequently, you have to distribute it around your face quickly. It is free of scent, which lots of women like. Then, it doesnt clash with other cologne, etc. It is great for sensitive skin. I am always so cautious when trying new things, because I am prone to allergies and sensitivities. There was no burning or tingling and no redness or swelling. It was if I didn't even use it, except for the moisturizing on contact. It leaves your face hydrated and smooth and more elastic. It does seem to work. The price may prove a problem for many, however.  I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.	1
This product goes on very thick making it the perfect night time moisturizer. I'm just now starting to see some aging signs and have started taking more steps to protect and care for my skin. Moisturizing and protecting is essential to keep skin looking dewy and fresh. For morning use, I tend to use it fresh out of the shower after a toner and on damp skin to help use less of the product.  After using it for a few days, I do notice that my skin feels fresher longer during the day, but I have not seen any improvement in my fine lines at this point. That should take some use with the product if it does happen at all. The scent is mild and pleasant, dissipating after a few minutes. The feeling of "I have moisturizer on my face" stays around for a while. I'm not sure how to describe that, but I think someone who wears moisturizer regularly would know what I'm talking about there.  Overall, I'm excited to continue to use this product to see how it whips my fine lines into shape. I'm really not expecting that, but I do expect this to keep up the good work.	1
I have super sensitive skin and Megan 21 is one of the few products that does not cause any burning or itching.  It does not take much to cover the entire face. This does plump up the skin and moisturizes. My skin felt soft. The one drawback to this is that it does not have a light feeling. I still would recommend it though for people with sensitive skin.	1
3.5 starts - First thing that hits you is the strong fragrance of this cream. I wish it was not so scented. The packaging is also a bit confusing. You unscrew the jar top but then there's a flat top 'pump'. You need to remove the tiny plastic plug that covers the small hole before the pump can dispense any cream. So far, cream goes on smoothly without feeling too greasy. It's absorbed quickly on the skin. This feels good around the eyes and forehead. It's really too early to tell if this cream will work to improve my lines and skin elasticity, which is my main reason for trying this treatment. *Update - Finished after 3.5 months of use, I have to admit my skin feels slightly better, a little softer and plumper. There seems to be a slow 'rejuvenating' effect that I don't normally see with other standard face creams. I would not go so far as to say it's firming up. It is a slight improvement though. I imagine you have to use this consistently for at least 6 months to see real, long lasting effect. I'm put off by the false packaging. I took the jar apart at the end. Of the 3" jar, the cream is only in about 1/2" of space. The rest is nothing but empty space/packaging. It's common in the cosmetic industry but still very annoying to see such a big gap of nothing in the jar.	1
MEG 21 Smooth Radiance Face Treatment, 1.7 fl. oz. is a great product. This is the first of item of their line that I have tried and I must say that I am very impressed with the quality and results.  Very simple to use. Apply on your face, being careful to follow directions and over applying. One pump is all that I find to be the required amount. It absorbs nicely into your skin and leave a really refreshing feeling. I do not have many wrinkles but its good to know that this product will help to keep it that way or even better, remove the few that I do have.  MEG 21 Smooth Radiance Face Treatment is worth the price. I have used other expensive treatments that did not really act any better than cheaper products you can buy at your local store. This one is definitely a high end, high result product. Very pleased with it.	1
This cream is wonderful my wife loves it and uses it daily. She loves the way it feels on her skin as it makes it feel very moist. It smells fairly nice as well. I tried a little of it myself to see how it worked and noticed it didn't have any negative effects on my skin and that it did have a nice feeling to it when it went on. I have fairly sensitive skin so it was nice to see that the product didn't cause any breakouts or other issues.  It's a really nice product.	1
OK, so I have been using this a few times and really love how this feels on my face.  I love the way this pumps into the container, very nice.  I find I only need one pump to use on my whole face.  You notice right away, this makes your face feel soooo much better after just one use.  I am already hooked.  as fare as wrinkles, etc., I will have to give it some more time to see if it makes a difference or not.  I do know, that this is going to be my new go to day/evening cream and if it works to help minimize wrinkles, then that is an added bonus.  Very happy with how my skin feels using this product.	1
I've got the Clarisonic Aria and have used to regularly -- once or twice a week -- for years. I've found the condition of my skin much improved with regular use and rarely if ever have breakouts anymore. This sensitive head is softer than most, but still seems to clean well, though leaves my skin a little less pink than normal. Good for use in the winter when skin is drier, tighter and more prone to breaking or after a summer sun overexposure.	1
Clarisonic Brush Head Fan Sometimes  My skin looks much better when using my Clarisonic Mia 2 compared to using my hands or a washcloth. The deep cleansing makes my skin look and feel good though I honestly cannot tell a difference when using the authentic replacement brush heads compared to the generic ones. Although the price point isn't so bad for a Clairsonic brush head over the 3 month use period compared to the upfront cost for a brush head. Budget usually sways my purchase choice.  Since using my Clarisonic I rarely go to the aesthetician for facials and have learned to do more home pampering. Friends and family know to be on the lookout for CIarisonic special deals for me too.	1
After using any Clarisonic brush, my skin is soft and clean. If I use it weekly, my skin glows. WIth the "standard" Clarisonic brush heads, they all do a great job and I can't tell the difference in the outcome. I wash off make up before I use these for better results. Once the make up is gone, the real cleaning can begin. To make the brush last longer, I rinse and dry it completely between uses.  My son has eczema. He's tried using several brush heads. These used to work for him, but now they irritate his skin too.  I've tried generic brush heads. They don't do the job. They wear out very quickly and are rough.  I've also tried the premium Clarisonic brush heads. The premium brush heads have words like "cashmere" in their names. These are very soft and more gentle on your skin.  For best results with any of the brushes, just move the brush lightly over your skin and let the device do the work. If you scrub your skin with it, it won't feel good. The device does it's best cleaning when it barely touches the skin.  THis is a great Brush head, but feels just like the other standard heads, when choosing a Clarisonic brush head, any standard Clarisonic brush head will do an awesome job cleaning your skin and making it soft and smooth. I love these. If you want a softer head, try a premium one. Avoid the generic heads. Depending on how often you use this, the heads will last about 3 months, splurge on the good ones!	1
I love these brushes so so much. Clarisonic is the bomb and has saved my skin. Do yourself a favor and buy this to immediately get baby soft, supple skin. For reals.	1
I bought a Clarisonixc a few years ago and it came with this brush head. They last up fo 2-3 months. This particular brush head thoroughly cleans facial sin without causing redness or skin abrasion..used with the Clrisoni, this brush is great.	1
This replacement brush head is nice for sensitive skin.  The original brush that came with our Mia 2 had started to lose it's life.  This replacement head fit the Mia 2 perfectly and is gentle for my sensitive skin.  It does not leave my skin feeling burned or scratched.	1
I have a Clarisonic ( Mia 1) that I like very much. This is the first week this season in WI of serious shoveling and that means facial wind burn for me. Best test ever for a sensitive brush head!  This brush head worked wonderfully to cleanse even my beat up reddened wind burned skin. I am so glad to have it in my face cleaning arsenal. My face felt cleaned without being more irritated. Same smooth action as the other heads but much gentler. Very pleased with this new brush head.	1
This is a good brush - fits all the Clarisonics.  It's quite soft so I think most people could use this daily.  It comes with the plastic protector & is made in the USA.  Amazon is an authorized seller of Clarisonic products.  Make sure to see Ships From & Sold By Amazon when ordering here.  There are MANY fakes on the market.	1
If you have a Clarisonic, you now replacement heads are a necessity. My Clarisonic actually had this type of head when I bought it about the same time, so I'm not sure if this was/is a mostly new offering.  I have used it throughout it's useful life (I got a bit more mileage out of it than recommended and probably could have kept using but switched out of an abundance of caution). I have fairly sensitive skin, prone to clogged pores. This would cleanse well without making my skin feel roughed up. Putting on moisture after this is perfect for helping you end the day and prep for a new day of makeup when you wake up.  I clean my heads with baby shampoo or by running cleanser through the head while "scrubbing" the top of my hand every several days in addition to the daily cleaning after removing my makeup.	1
There are two things to consider here.  First, the Clarisonic product itself, second, the value pack presented here.  I am a big fan of my Clarisonic.  I've used it for years with various brush heads, from sensitive to the body brush.  I love the results I get.  I don't use my Clarisonic every day, a few times a week, especially when I'm wanting extra soft skin or when I have small breakouts.  I get the brush wet and put a small amount of facial soap onto the brush.  Then I use it on my face and neck by going in small circles.  After completing the brush cycle my skin always feels really clean and I do see a difference with regular use.  I replace my brush heads regularly, but I also worry about dirt, so I periodically douse the active brush head with rubbing alcohol while it is on to saturate the bristles and make sure they remain really clean.  Ok, as you can see, I am a fan of my Clarisonic, and I do believe it is worth it and does make a difference in my skin.  Now to address the value pack presented here.  This is a good deal.  It is nice to buy in "bulk" and get a slight discount.  When I buy individual brush heads at the local department store I spend around $28, so that would put 4 at over $100, this is a better deal and I don't mind keeping a few on hand.	1
These are great for removing dead skin, improving skin quality and reducing breakouts.  This four set is better priced than individual purchasing of the brush heads, and will last a year at normal use (Clarisonic recommends changing every 3 months). This fits on both the Mia and the Mia2.	1
Although these heads when used lightly felt nice on my skin, after about 6 weeks of use I noticed more irritation, blemishes, etc. than just washing my face with my hands which is how I've done it all my life. I tried to change up the cleansers thinking that they were causing an issue, but it didn't help.  Overall I think these just didn't work for my skin and I stopped using them because of that.	1
I've been a loyal Clarisonic user for 3 1/2 years now starting first with the Mia 2 and then transitioning to the Mia Fit (for travel) and Smart Profile.  As someone who struggled with cystic acne for a long time I very much appreciate something that helps keep my skin clean and that gives me the added bonus of making cleaning feel a bit more indulgent and spa-like.  Over the years, I've figured out which brushes I like the most and Sensitive is one of my go to brushes (though I also really like Acne and Cashmere).  I like it because it cleanses my skin without stripping it of moisture and feels really nice on the skin like a spa treatment.  Because Sensitive is my go-to brush head this set is great because it is more economical to get one or two.  That said if you're just starting out and trying to decide what works best for you I recommend one of the variety sets that has 4 types of brushes vs. one.  Those are great so you can find the brush (or combination of brushes) that best suits your needs.  If you're like me though and use the Sensitive brush heads regularly this set is perfect.	1
It is essential to change your clarisonic brush head every so often - for me its been once every 4 months, depending on how often i use it. If i use it everyday(which i don't) i would replace it every 2 to 3 months to achieve maximum benefits. This brush set is awesome. it will probably last you for a year or more (if you use other clarisonic brushes along side this one)  About the brush itself - This is my least favorite brush in terms of output. It is mild on your skin so it is great for everyday use but in terms of immediate results, this is my least favorite brush. I use it every other day but long term i think this brush has helped me with a beautiful skin. If you are a fan of exfoliation type brush (the deep pore cleansing brush) you will find this brush boring but trust me it works wonders for your skin if you use it everyday or every other day for a few weeks. i like to use mine every other day along with the deep pore cleansing brush and the radiance brush (twice a week) and my skin has shown a huge positive difference. It has helped minimize pores, gentle on sensitive skin types and gives you what i call a clarisonic glow!!  Try it to believe it. I know the prize is not cheap but this is a value pack. Like i said it will last you for almost a year depending on how often you use it and thus replace it.  I highly recommend.	1
I've been using my Clarisonic system for several years and love the product.  Until I got a sunburn, I didn't appreciate these heads for sensitive skin.  They allowed me to continue cleaning my pores while not hurting my burned face.  If you have sensitive skin, these Clarisonic brush heads are a plus for you when using your Clarisonic brush system.  They're truly gentle on sensitive skin.	1
I love my Clarisonic.  It was the one thing I didn't know I needed until I had one - now I don't want to go without it.  These brush heads are easy to install and last about 3 months with regular use.  These are for sensitive skin and allow you to really clean your skin without abrasiveness.  The bristles are very gentle and help me to maintain smooth, clear skin!	1
I bought my first Clarisonic (a Clarisonic Pro) more than ten years ago and wouldn't be without a Clarisonic. It came with two brushes but the normal brush wasn't gentle enough for me, so I started using the Sensitive brush and exclusively used that style for more than nine years with great results. Notably, I've tried the Radiance and Cashmere brushes more recently, and they also feel comfortable to my sensitive skin (especially Cashmere) and produce great results as everyday brushes too. But the Sensitive brush is what I've used most and has served me well as an everyday brush for many years. I do vaguely recall an initial adjustment period of break outs when I first started using my Clarisonic and that I worked up to twice daily use, but the Sensitive brush is a comfortable brush for my skin and has never caused any skin irritation.  I've noticed a big improvement in how my skin looks and feels using the Clarisonic with a Sensitive brush head. My skin definitely gets cleaner and looks brighter and clearer than when I wash by hand or have tried other cleansing gadgets, my dry skin absorbs my serums and creams better so it stays more hydrated and my fine lines look less noticeable, and my skin texture feels much smoother and softer especially when I use my Clarisonic with quality serums and creams. I rate the Sensitive brush four-pack five stars as it contains authentic Sensitive brushes that are the same high quality brushes as the single replacement brushes I've bought and used with great results for years, but the four-pack is a better value and a great choice whether for yourself or to gift to someone who owns any Clarisonic given that the Sensitive brush replacement head fits all models and comes nicely packaged.	1
These are the official replacement sensitive skin brush heads for the Clarisonic electric body and facial brushes.  The bristle quality is perhaps slightly better than on some of the other compatible brands of replacement brush heads, but they also cost four to six times as much.  The best way to avoid irritating sensitive skin is to strictly limit the amount of time the brush is used, especially on the face.	1
I'm very pleased with this set of brush heads. The Clarisonic Mia that I purchased came with 5 heads, but only one of them was for sensitive skin. My elderly mother has dementia, and she recently washed her face with something not intended for facial skin. Her face looked like a pickled beet for a week, and her skin peeled and itched. We used the brush head for sensitive skin on her face, with a gentle cleanser, and it worked wonders helping remove the dried, peeling skin gently and without further irritation.  If your skin is in good condition, you may not notice much of a difference in the brush head varieties. I didn't. But sometimes you need to know that you can clean your skin in the most gentle way possible. The heads for sensitive skin fill that need. The heads last a very long time.	1
These brushes compliment the Clarisonic massager well! I love that they are soft and not abrasive on my face, yet they get the deep down dirt.	1
I've had a Clarisonic Mia for about six years.  While I love it, the brush heads seem to need replacing every few months sine they always start to smell funky (even when I'm super careful about rinsing and drying them, cleaning them periodically, etc.).  I've since moved to a Foreo cleansing device, which I like much better.  This four-pack is an excellent value, and the sensitive brush heads are perfect if you do have sensitive skin. They snap on easily, and do a nice job of gently cleansing your skin.  That being said, receiving these did encourage me to get my Clarisonic back out and to use it again, but I really do prefer the Foreo overall.	1
I've had two different Clarisonic brushes and have tried both the generic and the Clarisonic brush heads.  While the Clarisonic brand brushes are more expensive, they usually fit much better and are easier to remove from the device.  The four brush pack comes out cheaper than buying them individually.	1
The sensitive clarisonic heads are, in my opinion at least, the best of the bunch.  They clean wonderfully without irritating the skin.  This is a legit four pack (i.e. there are actually four inside) and they are not some cheap knockoff.	1
I love my Clarisonic device and the way it maximizes the use I get out of the facial products I buy is amazing. My skin is very sensitive and I need to be careful about which brush heads I use. If I use one that is to harsh it will cause redness and skin will even break out from the irritation. The sensitive brush heads are amazing. Soft enough that they don't irritate my skin but effective enough to get rid of impurities. I love the fact that they are just as efficient with my facial cleansers and serums as well. They suggest replacing the brush head every three months so the four pack would last you a year, so when that is considered the price is reasonable. When you take into account you can actually use them longer than three months (sometimes six months) and they will be just as effective it makes it even more affordable.	1
I love Clarisonic and this is the brush head I use most often. I have sensitive aging skin and this head us responsible for better looking, smoother textured skin. I find I get a few months from each head so this is a full year of facial love. These are genuine replacement heads and I'm thrilled to have them.	1
I have the clarisonic face wash device and I got these to replace the brush heads on mine b/c I love it.  This is a great value for the product and they are as awesome as the original one I received with the purchase of the device.  So happy to have these on hand... it's like tooth brushes, you can never have enough.  Great value. Highly recommend.	1
I love my Clarisonic Cleansing Brush and was eager to try the various brush heads made for the unit.  This "Clarisonic Sensitive Four Piece Brush Head" gives you four brush heads for a nice price.  However, the sensitive brush heads feel no different, with the exception of the "Cashmere Cleanse Luxe Brush Head", from any of the others I have tried.  Each variation provides excellent cleansing action.  The only appreciable difference is the color of the band just inside the first row of bristles.  Clarisonic brush heads last a long time.  Although the company recommends you replace your brush head every three months, the one I have been using daily for six months is still in almost-new condition.  My recommendation is that you choose the variation of brush head that is on sale at the time you need new brush heads.	1
I have a Mia 2, and have only used the sensitive brush heads with it. Since I have purchased this exact product multiple times, I must admit, it was nice to receive one for review purposes :)  I am glad they have created more gentle brush heads recently, because I don't have particularly sensitive skin, and yet I feel the "sensitive" brush head is still somewhat abrasive. If you're not careful, you can still overdo it and irritate/aggravate your skin--so don't be fooled by "sensitive". I would personally never get the Deep Pore Cleanse or Alpha Fit brushes, unless I was using my clarisonic on my body. With that in mind, I love my Mia 2 with the sensitive brush and use it 2-3 times a week.	1
You invested in your Clarisonic ... and in yourself! So, while I know that these heads are a little expensive, they are also the best. (There is no doubt.)  As you would expect, the fit with this authentic head is just perfect (you aren't going to get that with a knock-off or generic head ... and the real worry is what it is doing to the actual Clarisonic). Likewise, the quality is outstanding. Again, the plastic is durable (it cannot be bent or folded or dented like the generic, low-quality heads). And the head itself has thick, even, gentle bristles (these precise bristles are what keep your skin glowing!).  These heads are what makes your Clarisonic amazing! They are as important as the Clarisonic itself. And this one for sensitive skin is outstanding! It cleans without irritating! And that's no minor feat!  If you have sensitive skin and use a Clarisonic, give this a try. If you compare it to the standard brush head, you really will notice a difference. And, I cannot say this enough ... buy the really thing! There's no comparison!	1
This soft Clarisonic brush head is perfect for my sensitive skin, but even though gentle, its really effective at cleaning and polishing. My skin feels silky smooth after each treatment. It replaces a slightly firmer brush head on a recently acquired Clarisonic Smart Profile brush system. Currently Im using it with the cleanser sent with the unit, however, I another reviewer suggested Cetaphil as an alternate that doesnt strip skin of vital oils and moisture.  I love the feel I get when using the sensitive brush head. I use it every other day to exfoliate and restore my skin to a more youthful glow.  The replacement head comes with a clear cover to protect the delicate bristles and instructions for mounting the replacement head. A superior product from a reputable company. Invest in your skin with a Clarisonic. Youll be glad you did.	1
I've been using Clarisonic products to cleanse my face since 2008, first with a Clarisonic MD and more recently with a Mia 2. Although I've tried other brushes, I keep coming back to Clarisonic and its "sensitive" brush. I am outdoors a lot, and the sensitive brush is strong enough to remove any combination of makeup, sunscreen, and perspiration I ask it to.  The bristles are soft and flexible enough that they don't feel as though you're using a power scrubber on your face. If you're new to electric brushes, start with the gentlest possible pressure so that you don't stress out your skin. You may want to begin by using the brush every other day until you are comfortable using the brush. A gentle liquid such as Cetaphil will help get your skin clean without stripping it. (I suggest Cetaphil because it is hypoallergenic and works whether you have oily, dry or combination skin.)  Any Clarisonic tool is an investment, so it makes sense to use authentic refill heads, especially because they are what comes in contact with the delicate skin of your face.  This replacement head is packaged with a clear cover for the bristles, as well as instructions for mounting it on your Clarisonic.	1
I have pretty sensitive skin - just scratching at it lightly can cause irritation sometimes, so I use the sensitive brush head with my Clarisonic Smart Profile. I have bought knock-off Clarisonic brushes in the past to save some money, but the "real deal" brush heads from Clarisonic are a lot better. The cheap ones get frayed and funky after just a few uses, but these ones hold up for the recommended 3 months of use before you should replace the heads (yeah... if you're reading this and have been using the same brush head on your Clarisonic for like, a year... Time to get a new one! :)  Oh, and this brush gives me squeaky-clean skin, doing just as good a job as cleansing that the regular brush head does. So don't worry about it doing a sub-par job just because it's labelled "Sensitive".	1
I've been a regular Clarisonic user for nearly 3 years now and the Sensitive brush head is my go to.  As someone who has sensitive, dry, acne prone skin, this brush head is perfect for me.  It cleans my skin thoroughly enough to keep acne at bay and help my skin maintain its radiance, yet its gentle enough that my skin doesn't look red or irritated after use.  That said, even with a sensitive brush head I think you have to figure out the right frequency of usage for you.  I've played around with the Clarisonic a bit and find that at least for me, every other day is best.  Would recommend	1
I'm not thrilled with the Mia FIT, but nothing beats the original Clarisonic brushes. By original I mean the ones that are made by the Clarisonic company, as opposed to cheaper knockoffs. As is the case with toothbrushes, cheaper is not better. Knock-off brushes are harsher on delicate skin. This brush for sensitive skin is made to go lightly over your face, in small circular motions. Even my winter-chapped skin isn't bothered.	1
This brush head is a little more gentle on the skin, but still gives a nice deep clean and keeps pores clear. Skin is soft and smooth as always with using the Clarisonic.	1
I have had my Clarisonic for seven years and love it! I wouldn't trade it for anything. I've tried other devices of so many kinds (including the Susan Lucci monstrosity) and this is the best thing ever!! I've given MIa's as gifts and they are always well loved.  I use the Deep Pore normally---it's the same as the sensitive but it has longer bristles. I like that both the Deep Pore and the Sensitive work on my face without any kind of abrasion or irritation. I have some sebaceous hyperplasia now and these heads don't cause any problems with it at all. Ever since forays into buying Clarisonic replacement heads on (auction sites and on here) resulted in fake heads I've not purchased anywhere but Ulta. These are actually branded heads so I am confident I'm getting genuine product!  These are great for helping your skin care routine and I couldn't recommend them enough.	1
Love my Clairisonic Mia and this is a replacement  brush that's not harsh on the skin.  Very easy to install and use.  Is what it needs to be.	1
This is now my favorite Clarisonic brush head. It is soft and gentle but effective at exfoliating and that works well with my skin type.  I don't like abrasive heads that feel like I took sandpaper to my face.  What's funny is I just wrote those thoughts out and then when I looked down the product page at the various heads offered it listed this head as "gentle but effective" and those were the same words I used too so I say this head is exactly what it says it is.	1
I love this brush. It is so soft, yet it still cleans well because the Clarisonic device is awesome. I'm glad they came out with this sensitive skin version.	1
The Clarisonic system is one of the finest facial cleansers on the market. The sensitive brush head is soft and gently cleanses sensitive skin. Clarisonic heads are more expensive than the generic brands, but they are worth it for the quality and the versatility. I need to get the cashmere head replacement next. Until then, the sensitive skin works beautifully for my skin.	1
This brush head is a lot more comfortable to use than the normal brush heads.  I pre cleanse before using the Clairsonic Mia 2 cleaning brush, but this gets off remaining makeup.  Even with the Sensitive head, I can't use it more than 3x a week or my skin will get irritated.  The Clairsonic can over-exfoliate your skin and while this is better than some of the other options, it still isn't quite gentle enough for my sensitive skin.  I used it consistently about a year ago and my skin was literally rubbed raw by the Clarisonic so I stopped using it.  I picked it up again to try out this brush head and my skin was quickly irritated.  Update:  I recently tried out the Solo Mio, which is sold on Amazon and is supposedly a dupe for the Foreo Luna Mini.  After using the Solo Mio I won't go back to the Clairsonic.  I have been using it for about a week and it has not caused any irritation and is so much gentler than the Clairsonic.	1
I just reviewed another brush head and again I shall tell you that I love my Clarisonic and have bought 6, 1 for myself, rest for daughters and granddaughters.  We all love the products of this company and this brush is no exception.  Have used mine since they first came out (at least it was the first time I had seen them).  I have not had one negative issue with any of the brushes I have used and neither have the other 5 females I talk to all the time.  Thanks again for making a good and reliable brush which lasts quite a long while.  Keep up the good work.	1
Great replacement brush and wonderful for sensitive skin. There are lots of replacement brushes on the market but you cannot be Clarisonic's own brand	1
I love my Clarisonic Smart Profile Cleansing Brush so I was pleased to find the "Deep Pore Facial Cleansing Brush" since I have some problem with clogged pores.  After using this brush for several weeks, I have seen no difference between the "Deep Pore Brush" and the standard cleansing brush that is included with the Clarisonic unit.  The bristles are no stiffer and there is no variation in the height or placement of the bristle rings.  I like this brush head, but would not purchase one again until I need a replacement brush head.  When doing so, I would compare the cost of the "Deep Pore Facial Cleansing Brush" against the regular brush head and purchase the less expensive of the two.	1
I love Clarisonic.  I've been a loyal user for nearly 3 years and love what it's done for my skin.  I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin (and am also concerned about aging).  I love how the Clarisonic has thoroughly cleaned my skin to keep blemishes at bay, helps with skin radiance, yet doesn't irritate my skin.  I tend to use my Clarisonic every other day (I started out slowly in the beginning and worked my way up until I found the right frequency).  Most of the time I use a sensitive, acne, or cashmere brush head.  Since my skin is on the more sensitive side, these softer brush heads work best for me to use regularly.  But about once a week I'll use this deep pore brush head for a deeper cleaning either to help with exfoliation or because I've used more makeup than usual.  I've found that once a week it's a great supplement to a softer brush.  For my skin type I can't imagine using it more frequently than I already do, but for this frequency it's perfect.  Would recommend	1
I've been using the Clarisonic cleansing system for several years now.  It never occurred to me that my face needed anything more than a washcloth and facial cleanser.  Was I wrong!  I was amazed at how much deeper a cleaning the Clarisonic gives.  The deep pore cleaning brush head (stiffer than the one I use daily) eliminates white heads and black heads.  It leaves my skin free of clogged pores and with a healthy glow on my shiny-clean face.  Clarisonic brush heads are easily interchangeable.  For daily use, I like the softer brush head, but when I need to get deeper into the pores, I use this one.  If you think your face is clean, try washing one side as you normally would and the other side with the Clarisonic brush head.  That's all it will take to convince you.  Really.	1
Having used a Clarisonic for years I admit I have used off brand brushes as well as Clarisonic brand brushes and the difference is clear. The Clarisonic brushes are much softer. As I allow the brush to run over my skin I remind myself to let the machine do the work and not press too hard. Since using this official brush I have experienced no negative skin reaction and less redness. I recommendations to brand cleaning heads,	1
I've been using the Clarisonic Mia Fit, & this brush head works well with it. This one is soft & very similar to the one that was included when I purchase the Mia Fit. It is gentle on my skin, & I use it a few times a week. I really love the Clarisonic system & I recommend it for clearer looking skin. :)	1
This replacement head for your Clarisonic device is very easy to install.  Note that this one is for deep pore cleansing.  My other brush head was for more sensitive skin.  While I definitely notice a difference - this one is a bit rougher - it's still gentle on sensitive skin.  No reddening or discomfort at all.  I also like that it's easy to clean.  I'm now a true Clarisonic fan.  My skin looks amazing now that I've been using the device and I'm happy that it's so easy to replace the brushes!	1
Yes!!! I found my brush mate :) I have been using my clarisonic for over a year now and I only get the gentle(sensitive) brush head and use it every other day. I wanted to try a different one and when i saw the deep cleaning brush was available in Amazon, I had to try it. I am not disappointed. I could tell the difference right away. The bristle is more dense and slightly rougher than the than the sensitive brush. So this helped with exfoliating my skin and helping with my dry skin issues. My face was smoother and firmer in just one use. I live in Illinois and the weather here is rough in winter and my skin has a lot of dry patches. This has helped my skin to better absorb the various products(serums, masks and moisturizers) i use. Overall I'm very pleased and would definitely recommend you add this luxurious brush to your beauty routine. TIP - I would use it twice a week followed by a nourishing mask and a good serum.	1
I do not see a difference in results with the different types of brush heads. I still get the same great feel on my skin, so it isn't a complaint that I can't tell a difference.  This one doesn't irritate the skin, even though it's intended for deep pore cleaning. It is not any more harsh, etc. Skin looks and feels great. Keeps away any dry patches since it exfoliates so well. Pores are not as prominent, and blackeads have disappeared, but that is the case with any of the brush heads.	1
This is another good brush from Clarisonic. I've had my Clairsonic device for a couple of years. It's easy to use, while giving your complexion a thorough cleansing. This deep pore brush works well. I use the brush a few times a week and it makes a big difference.	1
On both sides of my nostrils I  can see the pores have an abundance of sebum.  If I scrub hard with a wash cloth it comes off, so I was hoping this brush head could do a better job but it didn't do a thing. Also it slings water unlike the original brush head on my Mia 2.	-1
This is a very nice product.  I have used many versions of this type of product using my Mia 2.  This particular brush head will give you a very deep cleaning.  it might be too harsh for sensitive skin, it is definitely stiffer than the green or pink ones I have used.  It does a very good job, and I am very satisfied with it.  I have noticed clearer skin using the clairsonic cleaner.	1
The Clarisonic Deep Pore Brush Head fits my old Clarisonic Pro and new Mia Fit I splurged on last week. I usually use the delicate brush head for daily use as my skin is sensitive, but I was interested to try the Deep Pore Brush Head as I get a few clogged pores along the sides of my nose. So far, I like the Deep Pore Brush Head a lot. The bristles are softer than expected, and it feels stimulating without being irritating to my skin. I'm not sure it minimizes my pores, but the problem pores by my nose look clearer and better as it gets rid of white gunk I still get sometimes, plus this brush does a great job clearing the rest of my skin of makeup, dirt, and dead skin. My skin looks and feels great afterwards and absorbs my face serum and cream really well. I love using a Clarisonic and part of the experience is that the brushes are great quality, including this Deep Pore Brush Head. Definitely recommended.  PS I've posted pictures showing how the brush head fits different style Clarisonics, but the Clarisonic itself is not included.	1
This brush head is good quality and does provide a deep clean. I tend to struggle with black heads on my nose and this brush, along with my preferred cleanser, actually cleared the blackheads nicely. It is not a brush I would use every day, but it is perfect for that weekly deep clean.  Please note at this time there is no product description at the top of the page to let potential buyers know this brush does not fit the Clarisonic Plus. You have to scroll to the middle of the page to see which units it's compatible with.	1
I have a mia 2 and am a big fan of the clarisonic device and heads! I have a couple different heads and i find that this one is a bit "rougher" than some of my others, I guess that is to get the pores? But regardless it works very well. I have roseca so i find this is not for me to use every day but i switch it with my other ones and that works for me!	1
This replacement brush head is great, just like the original one that came with my Clarisonic Smart Profile. I wouldn't call it gentle but it's definitely not rough. It feels like a facial scrub with beads being massaged into your skin at a very high speed.  Clarisonic have a multitude of brush heads with various textures for different skin problems so it's important that you choose the right one. This brush head is specifically designed for deep pore cleansing. It does a great job but it will probably be too rough for sensitive skin.  I'm a big fan of Clarisonic, it does wonders for my face. I use the deep pore brush head almost every day, and my skin feels a lot smoother. I get fewer blackheads - I'm not saying they are completely gone but there is definitely a noticeable difference. I also routinely use a pore minimizer creme after cleansing with Clarisonic - that helps too.	1
After using any Clarisonic brush, my skin is soft and clean. If I use it weekly, my skin glows. WIth the "standard" Clarisonic brush heads, they all do a great job and I can't tell the difference in the outcome. I wash off make up before I use these for better results. Once the make up is gone, the real cleaning can begin. To make the brush last longer, I rinse and dry it completely between uses.  I've tried generic brush heads. They don't do the job. They wear out very quickly and are rough.  I've also tried the premium Clarisonic brush heads. The premium brush heads have words like "cashmere" in their names. These are very soft and more gentle on your skin.  For best results with any of the brushes, just move the brush lightly over your skin and let the device do the work. If you scrub your skin with it, it won't feel good. The device does it's best cleaning when it barely touches the skin.	1
Two or three years ago my two daughter and I went Christmas shopping at Macy's.  Lo and behold, there was a new product - at least new to us - and we had a great conversation with the lady at the counter.  I ended up buying six of these facial cleaning machines.  taking care of the gifts for 2 daughters and 3 granddaughters.  All of us are still using those same little machines with the variety of brush heads.  I found out early on you could NOT buy the brush heads at Macy's at that time (maybe still not) so I turned to my old reliable, AMAZON, who has everything I could ever want (except a new male friend) and there they were.  I didn't like using the same one forever so I replenished when necessary.  Best money I ever spent was on that machine.  Now, these 2 or 3 years later, I feel the same way.  It's possible I've bought a Clarisonic Deep Pore Cleansing, Brush Head before but I don't remember it being called that.  Deep pore is what I really need cause I sometime have a whitehead or two and I think this would be a good product to keep those little devils at bay.  If you have the face cleaning machine you probably agree with me.  I am QUITE SO a senior citizen and I can't tell you how many people are astonished when I tell them my age.  My face has few wrinkles and I owe 1/3 of that to heredity, 1/3 to good cleansers and 1/3 to Clarisonic face brush.  Thank you, Clarisonic and thank you, Amazon, for combining together and giving me a chance to review these brushes.  Even my Dermatologist commented that I had taken great care of my skin.	1
I love these brushes so so much. Clarisonic is the bomb and has saved my skin. Do yourself a favor and buy this to immediately get baby soft, supple skin. For reals.	1
I haven't been as vigilant about using my Clarisonic lately, but I do like how it gently exfoliates. I've tried different brush heads and this is gentle even though it deep cleans.  It's a bit expensive at $22/brush head but it works well.	1
I love the deeper clean you get from this brush head ~~  it IS a little rougher, but I really feel like my skin is the smoothest and cleanest it has been in a while.  I work in manufacturing, and feel confident this brush head is pulling out all the oil, dirt and dead skin cells that are on my face.  Even though it's a little rougher brush than other Clarisonic brush heads it's by no means ROUGH on your skin ~~  the softer brush tips make them all a refreshing and unique way to clean your face.  The Clarisonic Mia is one of the best investments I've ever made.  I bought it about 4 yrs ago and it still works great!!  Brush heads have come a long way, and this one is my favorite yet.	1
I really like the deep pore brush for occasional cleansing. If you use your clarisonic for acne, this is probably not something you want to use every day. I make sure my skin is soft - out of the shower or bath - and then i scrub away. The clarisonic has really helped clear my acne and this is good to slough off all the gross old skin.	1
I own 2 Clarisonic Cleansers and cannot say enough positive things about them. I currently use the soft brush heads. I like this brush head because it cleanses thoroughly without being too rough on my skin. This review has little to do with this brush head, but really has everything to do with the  cleanser which is a great way to establish good facial hygiene.	1
I've been using the Clarisonic Mia 1 with the Radiance head. I wanted to try this deep pore head to see how it would impact the rough texture created by age spots. I noticed the difference right away; this head has a more robust action. Even compared to the Radiance head my skin looked smoother and less dull.  I would not be able to use this head daily but for a weekly treatment it is perfect for making my skin look as good as possible. The difference was especially noticeable around my nose and forehead. I do recommend this head for vigorous deep cleaning.	1
I'm very pleased with this brush. While I don't think I'll be using it very frequently I do like how it was able to smooth out my skin, almost like getting a mini facial. It is a harsh brush compared to the others I have which is why I'll be saving it to just use from time to time. After using it my skin was fairly red so I wouldn't use it unless you'll be home for the day or are heading to bed, my skin had calmed down by the morning and I was able to put makeup on at that point. All in all this brush is a nice addition to a skin care set for those looking for a deep clean.	1
This is a good brush - fits MIA.  It's actually quite soft so I think some people could use this daily.  I use it a couple times a week.  But if you have very sensitive skin it may be too much for everyday use.  Nothing can make your pores smaller  - they are what they are.  BUT you can diminish the appearance by keeping them clean.  This brush or any of the brushes can help.  This brush will not magically change your pores.  Also, if this brush is too much for your skin, you can actually make your skin worse in appearance.	1
Good quality product: fast-drying and relatively chip-resistant. A bit difficult to remove, but the same is true for all dark polishes.	1
This is a premium nail polish that is formulated without camphor, dibutyl phthalate, formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin and toluene. It is more than just a black nail polish. When painted over another polish, it cracks making some cool patterns. For summer it look terrific applied over white or light pastels. It is quite dramatic when placed over red or orange. But I wasn't especially impressed  when used alone. The polish is quick drying and seems to last.  While naming polishes after international airports is a clever idea, frankly I found the name objectionable and insensitive. "Whack is crack" reminded me of the late Whitney's Houston's infamous interview with Diane Sawyer where she said "crack is whack", stating that wealthy people would not have to resort to a street drug like crack. I may be unduly optimistic but I assume that most people realize that the city of Houston is not named after Whitney. And for what it is worth, neither the color or the texture evoked the spirit of Houston, a city I have visited many times. That being said, this polish will help you achieve a fashion forward look. I usually just buff my nails, a habit developed after dealing with the disastrous after effects of a year or so of acrylic nails. When I use polish it is usually clear or neutral colors although I do miss the color and creativity I enjoyed with the acrylics.  Still it is fun to play with color and texture. This polish does not contain objectionable chemicals, is quick and easy to use and when used with other colors provides a fun yet classy look.	1
Two coats provided a smooth finish, and the metallic look isn't as overwhelming as I'd feared, although that may be because it distributes unevenly.  It does take longer to dry than some polishes, but the outcome is worth it. It lasts.	1
The Uslu Airlines Bernhard Willhelm Nail Polish is a new nail polish that applies in a matte finish and then it cracks to give you a brick like finish. I didn't like the way that this nail polish looks on my nails. The polish applies easy but if you don't like cracked and matted nail polish you will not like this. Beautiful bottle and a cute name(Whack is Crack)  but I didn't like the way that this nail looked and the texture is not good at all but maybe if you are into that type of polish you will like it.	-1
USLU AIRLINES NAIL POLISH - METALLICS  When I saw this polish I immediately thought of my grand daughter.  She loves to wear polish on both her fingers and toes.  The polish comes in a cute bottle and looks very cool and funky -- we thought it would come out in a dark ebony color with sparkles throughout.  We were in for a huge surprise.  First we put the polish on her fingernails.  What a disappointment.  There are hardly any glitters or sparkle at all.  What we ended up with is a plain clear base coat that had hardly any sparkles showing.  Too bad, it looked so promising --  Then Paige had the idea to paint her toe nails with a pink polish and try putting the USLU AIRLINES POLISH on top of that -- maybe then the glitters and sparkles would show.  Nope, not even with a pink base coat.  We did apply a second coat and did manage to get a few sparkles on her thumb.  A little while later -- they came off!  Hmm -- certainly not worth the $16 asking price.  We have another glitter and sparkle nail polish that we purchased at a retail store for under two bucks.  And guess what?  It works fabulous, tons of glitter, tons of sparkle.  So, if you are looking for a base coat with hardly any glitter or sparkles showing up and want to throw sixteen of your hard earned dollars out the window, this is the product for you.  If you are sensible and like to get a bang for your buck, go to the nearest retail store and get some polish there for a much better product and a lot less cash.  Thanks.	-1
The best thing I can say for this polish is it dries quickly and contains no formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate, toluene, formaldehyde resin or camphor.  It also made my nails stronger and harder than *any* other nail polish.  If what I see in the bottle transferred to my nails, I would've been one happy gal. Alas, it doesn't.  The bottle makes the polish look black with lots of glitter mixed throughout.  What brushes onto my fingers, however, is clear with very few glitter pieces and a few larger black U-shaped flecks.  When I showed my husband, he said it looked like I had been digging through a garbage filled with coffee grounds.  To see what he saw, please see the picture attached to this review.  EDIT 6/11/2015: When I told my daughter how unhappy I was with how this polish looked, she went to the product page -- and then promptly laughed at me.  It seems as though the larger black flecks are supposed to look like leopard print, and the glitter was there (but not visible) because it's supposed to go over the top of a darker nail polish.  Silly me!  I have to admit, it would look prettier over a darker color, and the glitter would have shown up quite nicely.  However, this grandmother doesn't think too much of the "leopard print."  Maybe in my younger years, but not so much any more.  However, because I obviously didn't know enough about this stylin' polish when I originally wrote the review, I've changed it from 2 stars - 4 stars.  My next polish purchase will be this brand, but in a color more appropriate for this little old lady.	1
This is a pretty decent item.  You need to put several coats on it for it to look right but once you are done it looks nice.  I was advised you would need a decent top coat finish on it after you are done for it to last longer.  It is very durable once you are done.  The person that I had done has been trying to pick it off for several days and it isn't coming off so it wears well.  The only issues that came up was you have to take your time or you can see the brush strokes and it could streak.  Take your time when you apply the polish and you will get a really nice result.	1
I used to love to get professional manicures every week.  But alas, my nails paid the price.  I now occasionally do my own nails and I'm always looking for new nail polish colors to try. I'm usually more of a traditional color gal, give me pink or red any day.  This nail polish is well, very black.  I guess if I were into gothic or something, I would like it better.  That is why I only gave it four stars.  The good stuff about this nail polish: * It goes on very smoothly and with just the right amount of thickness.  I think it would last a while on your nails.  * It is without some of the usual harsh chemicals found in nail polish.  It doesn't have: formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin camphor, dibutyl phthalate, or toluene.  * The interesting names.  Each polish is named after an airport.  I like another reviewer's idea of applying this polish over another color.  It sounds as though you get some interesting patterns.  If you like black nail polish that is high quality, you will like this polish.	1
Have never seen anything quite like this.  It takes a bit of doing to use.  The sparkly foil pieces are larger than the sparkles in other "glitter"polishes and they are not evenly dispersed in the clear polish so you have to very carefully fish for them to get some on to each nail in an  evenly dispersed pattern.  But that also gives you the freedom to be creative and let each nail be a little different.  I expected the overall effect to be dark, almost black, as the product page circle and the name of the polish suggests, but it is a clear polish with blue/green/gold bits of foil.  Of course you could apply it over some black polish, if that's the look you want.  The polish is "five free" (no toluene, formaldehyde, etc.) which is essential for me.  A fun alternative to my accustomed Ballet Slippers.	1
This is an amazing shampoo for my thick, straight and long hair! I was using Morrocan Oil products for 5years and I love the Oribe Gold Lust products better! I ordered the Gold Lust Repair & Restore Onditioner also. Not too many salons carry this product and Neiman Marcus carries this also!	1
Love Oribe products and this one is great!	1
I live oribe  products but not this product. Worst ever. I am wondering if it was even authentic.	-1
Excellent conditioner. Leaves my hair very soft and manageable without frizz. The fragrance is beyond beautiful. Very elegant.	1
Oribe is one of my most favorite product lines ever. Their conditioner is amazing; and my hair has never felt softer or stronger. I'm obsessed.	1
Hands down my favorite shampoo and conditioner! Is definitely expensive but leaves my hair so soft	1
Not worth the money.	-1
First off my hair is very blonde highlighted it's thin but I have a lot of it and it's alittle past my bra strap I'm growing it out alittle - I have used Lanza Healing oil conditioner, joico aveda ect. All top brands but I stumbled across this in an upscale salon store and figured I would give it a shot I cringed at the price but after only 2 uses I'm hooked this stuff is amazing! I plan on buying the travel set for my up coming vacation trip! I gave 4 stars due to price I think this could be a 40$ item however my hair feels like I just left the salon and it smells amazing! I can't wait to see the long term effects of this product if your hair is colored you will love this! I don't even have to use any products on my hair except unite 7seconds and medium hold Moroccan oil finishing spray and my blow outs are great! I'm not loving Oribe's hair sprays, oils or creams they weigh down my hair but I will continue to buy this Edit: a few weeks of using this and the shampoo my hair has ever looked better it's healthy bouncy and over all looks great! Finally a shampoo and conditoner that work as promised definitely a fountain of youth product	1
I thought I was ordering the shampoo cause that's how it was listed.. turns out I got the conditioner instead. A mistake turned into a pretty good product review. Def felt super silky after a use and soft!! Don't go crazy with amount, little goes a long way and focus more on middle to ends of hair.	1
On time ,I love it	1
Works great for my Hair ,repaired my frizz,and dry ends. Left my Hair smooth and manageable along with a nice shine. Hair looked nice all through the day. Scent is nice but not overpowering seems to fade  out during the day .Does what it says .	1
Great stuff. A little goes along way. My hair is both colored and blow dried every day. I haven't had an "off" day since I stared using this. PS ..... I'm 59.	1
A mist have for gorgeous hair !!! Particularily if you color at all.	1
Smells Amazing. Might go back to Davine Oil line for my curly unmanageable hair. I still love this though.	1
good	1
this is the best shampoo available	1
Not worth the money.	-1
AMAZING find!!	1
This adds body to my heavily layered hair without drying it out. It feels soon good.	1
I use this very time I blow dry.  I love all the Oribe products and am never disappointed when using them.	1
Great stuff, leaves hair nice and thick.	1
Smells Amazing. I think it works? Haven't really noticed, but I honestly just use it for the smell in my hair.	1
good	1
I wish I could give this oribe hair product more than five stars,this is by far the best heat styling protector I have ever used and I have use many from drug store brands to high end brand and nothing that I have used gives me the results like oribe Balm does. I have used this for a short time and am new to this particular  product .After my usual washing and conditioning my hair I spray some oribe foundation  mist than spray a few drops of this balm in my hands rub together and evenly distribute this from roots to ends concentrating more on the ends and finally I add a dime size of the supershine moisturizing  cream through my hair and my hair has never ever look better .This leaves my hair free of frizz and very smooth ,manageable  and with a awesome shine. I have also used this alone and got great results as well so on days I really have to rush I will just use this .I let my hair air dry put it in a low ponytail  and I felt like I just walked out of my hair dressers .I went to my local spa for a mani today and they asked if I just had my hair done so that there tells me people see the difference. I purchased this because I do use heat styling tools often olso and this is the best protection from any further  damage I have already done to my hair. This is worth every penny I paid  and will continue to buy when I run low especially with the heat and humidity. Seller was also exceptional I have placed many orders with Hair Mafia and I am always very pleased .	1
Decent mask. It exfoliates dead cells thanks to 10% glycolic acid (chemical peel).  There is also quartz and if I scrub while applying and removing mask it works as a mechanical scrub. Kaolin works good on oily skin with enlarged pores and jojoba leaves the skin smooth. I was able to leave mask for about 20 minutes without any uncomfortable feeling, like burning or tightening of the skin. I removed it under the shower and to my surprised when I used toner, the cotton pads still showed traces of mask. My skin was definitely exfoliated but it was rather gentle exfoliation. My absolutely favorite mask is white Glamglow, which really makes skin smoother, lines and pores less visible, but it is more expensive for smaller jar.  A little goes long way, thin layer is enough.  This is decent but not as powerful. I will also use it as a spot treatment as all the mask with similar ingredients work great with occasional pimples.  Considering value and the effect this is good mask.	1
This spa-powered clay mask treatment is soothing and refreshing to use as you spread a thin layer all over your face and leave it on for 5-7 minutes and I even left it on for over 15 minutes at times. I used it twice a week and it smoothed out my skin by sloughing off the dead cells and scrubbing my skin clean and left it feeling smooth and clean. I loved the feel of my skin as it was soft and it helped reduce my blocked pores on my nose. I did use a simple gel cleanser to help remove it completely.	1
Earlier this month I turned 35 and I swear it was no big deal. But ya know what sucks? Being 35 and having BOTH wrinkles and acne. Seriously!?! I am so over it.  When the chance came along to give the bliss Multi-'Face'-eted All-In-One Anti-Aging Clay Mask a whirl I figured at worst my sensitive and reactive skin would protest, I'd have a major break-out and I'd get to complain about this pricey product's uselessness. I hate to be wrong but this is one instance where I was very, very wrong. Not only did my skin not go all reactive like it has with pretty much every mask product I've ever used it helped heal the start of a hormonal acne flare-up without it actually surfacing. That doesn't happen to my face. Ever. The next morning after the first time I used it I noted that my complexion was glowing, like it used to when I was pregnant, so in a totally good way. Each subsequent use I've had the same results, any acne trying to ruin my week has had considerably less healing time and hasn't hurt as bad as usual and the day after my skin is radiant.  So why the 4 stars? First of all, when you read the fine print it warns that this can stain light colored fabrics. But it doesn't warn you that it can also stain your skin if you're very fair skinned like I am. No matter how much I scrub it I have a blue tint to my skin for a few hours afterward. :S Yikes! Secondly, I agree with another reviewer in regards to the microbeads, they're completely unneeded in this mask and I have been trying to avoid buying products with them because of their environmental impact.  Overall, I like it well enough that I would recommend it, especially to those who have the same wrinkles and acne issues I'm fighting.	1
This jar is so rich and indulgent. I absolutely love it. Reminds me of the Tea tree oil masks by Origins. I leave it on for 30 minutes. Have been using it for almost two weeks. I don't know about anti-aging but my skin does feel softer.	1
I haven't found a bliss product that I don't love.  This mask is no exception!  I have dry and sensitive skin, but this mask gave me no problems: no stinging, no rash, and no itching.  What it did give me was noticeably softer and brighter skin.  Since my skin is sensitive, I was pretty gentle on removal as the mask has little scrubbing things in it that I didn't notice until starting to remove it.  It was easy to remove even with my light touch.  A pleasure to use!  Note: I was afraid this would stain my washcloths, but it came right out in the laundry.	1
2.3 ounces actually turns out to be a good sized jar, and given that you're supposed to use only a thin layer, this should last a long time. The clay mask goes on easily and is not as dehydrating as some masks. Rather, the bliss product is comfortable to use and caused no blemishes or redness upon removal. Repeated use - twice a week - for a few weeks has not caused any acne or dry patches. Rather, my skin feels soft and smooth. I'll have to wait to discuss the anti-aging aspects of the product as I believe I look the same age as I did when i started using it, but who knows what several months of use will bring! The only downside of the product is that it can be difficult to remove - you'll definitely go through a washcloth or two to get it all off - but other than that, there's a pleasant odor and overall feel to the product. I used it after using Bliss Fabulous Foaming Face Wash.	1
This is a dark gray clay mask that comes in a small jar but it just takes a little and goes a long way. I followed the directions as written - apply a thin layer of mask over the face (avoiding eye areas) and leave on for 5-7 minutes. Remove the mask with a wet wash cloth and rinse your face until clean. I immediately noticed that my face was very, very soft and refreshed. One thing to be aware of - this contains alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) which causes sun sensitivity with some people and increases the chances for sunburn. I have sensitive skin but I did not notice any adverse effects from using the product.	1
My wife told me that her face felt different after even the first use. She explained it was softer and refreshed.	1
Works great. I had a bit of a problem with the scent of the product, so I couldn't wait to get it off my face as soon as possible. It does feel great once it's on, however, taking it off is a bit of hassle. It's easier to just apply to your face and then wait for a period of time and then just shower it off. Makes clean up easier to handle.  Overall, it felt really refreshing and it made it seem like my skin glowed.  Except for the scent, it's a great product.	1
This clay mask has exfoliating grit that works at dead skin as you apply the clay, it goes on easy and covers well just keep it out of your eyes as it has a menthol like cooling effect as the clay goes on and stays cooling as it drys. It never feels too tight or dry like many other face clays so its not uncomfortable to leave on while you wait. I use a soft cotton wash cloth to clean off,  use warm water to soak and wash away, it does take more work than others to clean off. The best way is to rinse off is in the shower. My face shines and feels fresh after I use this clay mask, it exfoliates clearing away dead skin leaving my face feeling clean and new!	1
When you open the jar the first thing you notice is that it looks just like clay!  I don't know why I would have expected anything else.  LOL. It has a nice clean fragrance and smells like a facial experience some of us have had in the past. Afterwards your face is pleasantly tingly and clean.  Leave a thin layer on for five to seven minutes, twice a week.  I highly recommend this product just because of the pleasant way your skin feels afterwards.	1
I love bliss products. They smell good, they feel good and you get a decent amount of product for the price. While I take all anti-aging products with a grain of salt, this mask did tighten my pores and gave me a healthy glow. Granted, it doesn't last forever or *really* anti-age me but I liked the couple-day boost from this product. I'll be buying more bliss products in the future.	1
I tried using the Bliss Crown Jewels collection that contained 4 skin products.  Some of the features are as follows: 1) These products contain vitamin C, E and green tea. The presence of these vitamins cleans and revitalizes the skin making it   feel soft and shining radiantly as ever. 2) It imitates the skin treatment that one gets after visiting a spa. 3) It is a good gifting option for the holidays.  Benefits: 1) The lemon scented sage body butter moisturizes dry skin and smooth-ens it well.  It is non- greasy with mild a citrus   fragrance. 2) The face wash acts as a cleanser as well as exfoliator to clean the skin of dirt and make-up. 3) The triple oxygen mask brings a glow to the face and wipes off the tired look. It has a mild scent. 4) The bliss love handler is a cream that one applies to the waist everyday. The  product claims to reduce the body fat along   with exercise and a balanced diet over a period of time. I have to try the results as yet. Will update my review later.	1
This is a great set! It has a few products I haven't tried before. I do wish there was more of a theme to it, but it's apparently their best sellers so oh well. Still a great set!	1
I love Bliss products, but am often unwilling to spend the money.  This is a really nice gift set, and a better value for Bliss.  I'm not sure I quite understand what the Love Handler does, needs to be used in conjunction with diet and exercise, well .... if I wanted to diet and exercise, I wouldn't be looking for a product to help with that area.  So I dropped it a star for that odd product.  Kind of feels like a throwaway in the package.  Everything else is great though.	1
This is a good way to try some of their top selling stuff. It also makes a wonderful gift. Bliss Body Butter - leaves my skin soft as a baby's skin. I hate lotions that leave my skin feeling greasy and the Body Butter does not leave it feeling greasy. It's not sticky on my skin either. It smells clean, no perfume smell. I'm sensitive to overpowering smells so this is perfect for me. Love it! Foaming Face Wash - I love this face wash. It's oil free and has exfoliating beads. It does not dry out my skin and the fragrance is just right. Love it! Triple Oxygen Energizing Mask - it delivers a shot of oxygen to your skin and it's supposed to protect the cells from free radicals. It's suppo to give your skin a boost when it's look tired. I think it has brightened my skin when I use it.	1
Bliss Crown Jewels is a set of four beauty products attractively packaged in a box for gift giving. (Theres even a paper band printed with the discounted price plus a note for buyers to remove the band before wrapping the box.) The products are:  * Lemon-Sage Body Butter, maximum moisture cream, 6.7 oz. This is an excellent moisturizer, not greasy, with a light, pleasant scent  * Lovehandler, 4 oz. When massaged into the skin, this is supposed to reduce fat--together with regular exercise and a healthy diet. This is a reasonable moisturizer but it doesnt do a thing to reduce fat, unlike exercise and a healthy diet. The advertised reducing ingredient is caffeine but you can always drink caffeinated beverages  * Triple Oxygen Energizing Mask, quantity not stated but smaller than the 2 oz bottle next to it. This is a refreshing facial mask, pleasantly scented, and does not irritate sensitive skin  * Fabulous Foaming Face Wash, 2 oz. An effective cleanser that contains exfoliating beads  These products are pricier than the drugstore and supermarket ones I normally use, but they're not really any better. However, generic drugstore brands just don't cut it as a fancy holiday gift, which is what this set seems intended for.	1
This has an intense scent to it that may bother people who have sensitivities to strong scents, or who have skin that reacts to scented products.  I have used this on my skin and it seems to float over the top rather than soak in like some quality moisturizers.  I found it hard to resist scratching.  I can not speak at all to long term use.	-1
After almost a week of use (and knowledge that I am stingy with my five star reviews) I have nothing but good things to say about this hydranting and firming cream. Its thicker, firm bodied and one can literally feel it working. And the best thing about it (in my opinion) is it stays on all day. It also seems to create a great barrier between the skin and makeup, therefore Im no longer using primer and my makeup both applies in a more even manner and last longer. I received a small sample size (think beauty counter sample) and plan on purchasing a full size. I was surprised to discover I prefer it to my long standing used Hope in Jar. (Also, no breakouts, at least for me.)	1
I have used better moisturizer products at varying price points. For several reasons, this does not meet my needs. While the moisturizing properties are suitable, I find the fragrance overwhelming and bothersome to my allergies. I washed it off because I felt I might start to wheeze. (If you don't have such sensitivities, it might be fine for you.) The size depicted is also not correct, because I only received a very small tube, not the attractive and generous jar as depicted. Sorry to say, I'll not be back for more.	-1
Per the wife: I love Natura Bisse and have used it for many years, but I had never before tried the Essential Shock cream.  This is more of a lotion than a cream. I liked the scent and it went on nicely. I would definitely buy it again. I have not noticed a decrease in my wrinkles but it keeps the skin hydrated.	1
I received a 0.3oz tube of this (basically a trial size). I found I needed a bit more to cover over my face and neck. There is a fragrance, but I didn't mind it. I thought the lotion really worked and helped moisturise my face. I have no had an reaction to it, and like it. The only reason I wouldn't buy it again is due to the high price of this lotion. Made in Spain.	1
I only received a tiny tube of this product and really am not that impressed with it.  It does moisturize but so do so many other cheaper products.  I wouldn't really recommend it.	-1
I had bad acne as a teen. After going the pill my face became an oil slick w cystic zits on chin. I tried the efficlar kit and it totally cleared up my skin. I continue to use it to prevent hormonal acne. Wish I had this as a teen	1
The best acne face wash I have ever used. I will forever repurchase. Holy grail!	1
Saved my oily acne prone 4o-year-old skin! Love this line...has helped with fine lines and discolorations too thanks to the addition of Glycolic Acid.	1
Love it. Foams and cleans my face very well, does not make my skin dry.  I think, it helps with acne, does not get rid of it but helps to keep the skin cleaner.	1
Very thin liquid and a lot of it comes out at once. Made my skin feel extremely dry and tight - actually would hurt to smile because my skin was so dry.  I also use retin-a and had read online that this cleanser would still be okay to use, but I found it extremely harsh for me.  Also, it's not really a gel. It's a very cery runny gel almost like a liquid. A lot comes out at once and you actually need a lot for a lather. I also bought LRP's pigmentclar cleanser and you literally only need a quarter of a pea sized dollop in order to clean your entire face. It's amazing!	-1
I love this cleanser.  I'm prone to breakouts and I have sensitive skin.  I'm able to use this to help with the breakouts without it irritating or drying out my skin.	1
This is the third Salicylic acid cleanser I've tried. All three of them work equally well at clearing my skin, and controlling breakouts, but I like this one the best because it doesn't dry my skin as much as the others. In fact, after only a week of use, not only does my face look clearer, but it feels softer and smoother. Even though it may seem expensive, this is a big tube, and a little goes a long way, so I expect that this will last a year, or so.  The only thing I don't like is that it's very runny. If I store the tube upright on the cap, when I open it it runs all over.  Even if I store it upside down, when I dispense some onto my fingertips, too much runs out, and it drips between my fingers, so I have to be careful or some of it gets wasted. I like this product, but wish it came in a pump dispenser. It would get five stars from me if it did.	1
This cleanser has a slight medicated smell due to the ingredients but despite that, it still leaves my skin feeling fresh without overdrying. It melts and cleans my make up off to prevent future breakouts. Stubborn acne in my T zone cleared up after a week of continuous us 2x per day. Now I only use this cleanser in the evenings to offset the higher price for it to last me longer.	1
Cleared my sons skin in about a week, without drying. Time will tell if this remains effective which has been a problem with other products. Face feels clean and smooth after use.	1
I really like this very gentle cleaner.  It is a clear gel that smells delightfully of peppermint and tingles on your face.  I have intermittent acne and while it is not as strong or as fast acting as proactive does seem to help a little.  I have only been using it for a week but my acne is not as bad as it usually is.  It contains Salicylic Acid which is proven to help acne.  I like the feel of it on my face and that it does not completely dry out my skin.  This product is a great addition to my skin care product regime and one that I believe I will continue to use in the future.  If you have sensitivity and acne I think this would be a good product to try but the results may take a time to show.	1
The refreshing minty aroma of this gel wash agrees with me.  I have introduced the wash by using it once a day and my skin has adapted to it nicely. Prolonged use will be the only measure to determine if breakouts have diminished.  Be careful to avoid getting this in your eyes as it stings, even a little trickle from your forehead into the eye area will cause pain. I have found the gel wash is compatible for use with a skin cleaning machine if you are lucky enough to have one.	1
I get some samples of various La Roche-Posay products at my dermatologist's office last week. He endorses them highly. I tried this medicated gel cleanser and thought it was refreshing and effective but also slightly drying because I have naturally dry skin in the winter months. I recommend it but suggest you also use a light moisturizer after use. It cleared up a small outbreak in a couple of days, but the moisturizer kept my skin supple and soft.	1
This is a great product!  A little goes a long way and even after just a couple washes, my daughter can really feel the difference in her skin.  She has always had problems areas and has used everything from Glo-Therapeutics to Proactive and so far THIS has received her highest review.  It isn't drying and she said her skin feels really clean.  After only a couple days of washing, her skin is showing signs of improvement and looks more fresh. It's amazing!  Another plus is that it doesn't bleach anything when she's done using it.  If you aren't fully satisfied with your current regimen, this is definitely worth a try.  It's an amazing product!

My favorite daily cleanser by far. I've been using La Roche Posay's Effaclar as a daily cleanser (morning and night) for years now. It's very neutral on the skin, and great for those prone to break outs. It's a little pricier than your usual Neutrogena stuff, but way better.	1
This is as good a medicated gel/exfoliator for skin as any other as well, including Proactive.  I have few breakouts since I have used such a product, and this one is no exception.  Sometimes a product like this will appear to cause a breakout or two initially, or if I use it too much.  Not sure that I know how that is happening there.  Overall, I see clear skin, and over a week I have used it twice.  I am only using this 4 X per month, because I have dry skin.  This product is much like others in a class I would call "premium".  I'd like to say more; however, at my age, I need to moisturize, moisturize after using a product like this.  It is fitting, though, to use this as I do need the benefits of this product.  Recommended.	1
Yes, I love it...helps to heal skin after breakouts! Never used anything this good before!	1
amazing acne system for mild to moderate non cystic adult female acne	1
This works wonders on pores! It shrinks your pores and cleans your face so well. I use it after washing my face and it removes remaining dirt and makeup. I'm very happy with my purchase! I love all of my products from this line.	1
I used this entire bottle and it did seem helpful in removing any excess make up left behind after washing my face....  But I feel like I could get that benefit for far less money.  I don't have much an opinion on this one.... not good, not bad, just meh.	-1
Great product! Both my kids use this for acne and it works well.	1
I have combination skin that has been the bane of my existence for years.  It's also finicky so it's tough to find products that work without adding to the breakouts.  I had quit using toner all together because I couldn't find one that effectively worked without being too strong and drying my skin out.  However, this clarifying solution so far has really been a charm!  No dry spots and it just seems to work.  MUCH fewer breakouts and I like that there's no harsh tight feeling on my skin after using.  I wipe it on with clean cotton squares (Shisedo) and let it work its magic and so far my skin has not revolted at all!  I highly recommend this product to those with persnickety skin like mine!	1
La Roche-Posay created a great product for your face with this one.  I am very impressed at how it penetrates the pores.  It will not dry out the skin like some similar products will and leaves your face feeling fresh, ready to take on your day.  It has a very, very light scent that will not be a factor for even the most sensitive noses.  I found using facial pads as the best way to go to apply this.  A very nice and convenient bottle is a great touch.	1
This is my second bottle of this product; I bought the first. It is the perfect toner for me. I have post-menopausal acne. This works well to tamp down breakouts but leaves my skin smooth. It is not drying. No discernible scent. Every other toner I have tried was far too drying on my face.  I also notice some textural improvements which is a real bonus. I'll definitely keep using it; works very well for me.	1
I got this toner to use as an exfoliating solution to clean pores and improve skin feel/texture. This product uses glycolic acid and salicylic acid to achieve those goals. The formula effectively prevents blackheads and really does clear up skin. I have not noticed any adverse dermatological effects from using it. This is a reasonably priced toner and I would recommend it.	1
My 17 year old has been struggling with acne for a while now but resists using most products because she is very sensitive to how various products smell.  She's also not very consistent in sticking with a skin care routine but had shown some improvement using a 3 step skin care line.  However, the acne kept returning or would just flare up suddenly.  I had her replace the toner she was using with this Effaclar Clarifying Solution and, after a couple of weeks of nightly use, her skin looks smoother and calmer.  Areas that are particularly breakout prone have started to heal.  She has fair skin but isn't too sensitive so has had no issues with dry or flaky skin.  She does still use her regular face soap and then follows the toner with a light moisturizer.  I think the salicylic acid provided just the boost her routine needed to clear up those stubborn areas.  I plan on replacing this for her when it runs out rather than have her return to what she was using.	1
After using for a week, I saw a significant reduction in my pore size, especially around my nose and cheek area. It is recommended that you use twice a day and you can even use it as a cleanser for make-up remover. The only drawback is that it tends to dry out my skin, so I have to use a moisturizer along side it. I trust Effaclar Clarifying Solution because they put out a good line of cleansing products for sensitive skin.	1
I'm "blessed" with the combination of aging skin and acne, so I've become pretty fussy about my toners. I stay away from most of the regular drugstore selections, because they dry out my skin and some of them cause flaking and irritation. My go-to choices have been some of the MUAC line. I'm very happy to report that this Effaclar Clarifying Solution has found a place in my regular routine.  I've been using this regularly for a couple weeks now -- I felt I had to give it a good trial to make sure it wasn't going to irritate my skin or cause breakouts. It hasn't done either; in fact it's helped to clear my skin, which was in the midst of breaking out when I started using the Effaiclar. I actually use it to remove my (light) makeup at the end of the day. After a couple cotton pads of this stuff, my skin is clean and toned, and treated with salicylic acid (and some glycolic acid as well, a skin-renewing treatment I have used in my MUAC treatments with excellent success).  I can't conclude this review without mentioning one more thing I liked about this toner: The packaging. The look is very clean and medicinal, as you would expect from a high-end, unscented acne/aging treatment. It's all business, no foolin' around. And I love the dispenser top. It's such a small thing, but so many cosmetics have cutesy and/or annoying dispensers. This is a simple flip-top that dispenses in easy-to-control quantities, a drop at a time (unless you squeeze firmly). That's a helpful thing with a toner like this, which is both powerful and costly; you don't want to blorp out huge, wasteful quantities.  Overall, this is a very well-thought-out toner that's far higher quality than most of what you'll find on a typical drugstore shelf. Highly recommended as a brightener and anti-breakout treatment for folks like me, who are still suffering from acne even as our skin begins to show its age.	1
Great product for acne-prone, or sensitive skin.  This is a big step up from products like Proactiv. I've been using the Effaclar cleanser for quite some time now, and it works super well.  The toner is a nice addition as well, to add a bit of a neutralizing/balancing texture. Might be purely placebo, but pleasant nonetheless.	1
I'm a big fan of La Roche-Posay products, and this one hasn't disappointed.  My only complaint is that it's a bit drying, but I find that true of most toners.	1
I thought this would be like every other salicylic acid cleanser, but there is something about it that seems to tighten and close my pores far more than the other products I've tried.  The cleanser is largely scentless, light-feeling, and leaves no residue on your skin. I have very tough skin, lots of huge pores, and have recently started getting menopause-related acne. This seems to take care of the greasy and reddish spotting I was getting and also dried up any of the cysts that had already made themselves noticeable.  The directions say you can use it 3 times a day  but, as tough as my skin is, I feel like once a day is plenty and more would be too drying.  I'm tentatively excited by this product as nothing else has worked to clear my skin for the long term.	1
I guess this is one of those TMI reviews so please don't read this unless you are an older woman with no acne problems but with minor problems of unrefined pores and some milia.  I avoid excessive exposure to the sun and do not smoke, so my skin is fairly good for an old(er) woman.  Not wrinkle-free but certainly not as wrinkled as it could be at my age.  However, when I look in my 8X magnifying mirror, that skin which seemed clear and blemish-free to my old eyes in a regular mirror tells me a different story.  Nose and chin have some enlarged, clogged pores and the cheeks have a few pores with very small clogs which look like small whiteheads but are actually very hard and round deposits called milia.  (See, I told you this was a TMI review.)  These clogged pores are a very stubborn problem.  I've tried scrubbing the heck out of my face with microdermabrasion products.  That does make the skin feel soft and smooth and pink but a close look in that dratted 8X mirror shows not much improvement in refining the pores.  I've even read online that dermabrading the skin too much can even cause milia.  So when I saw this product offered for trial in the Vine program I decided to give it a try.  After all, the salicylic acid (0.5%) and glycolic acid (2%) ingredients here are not just for acne.  They are generally used for deep-cleaning pores and lightly peeling the skin.  And, after using this for the trial time allotted by Amazon, I have to say it seems to be helping.  I've noticed a definite improvement in my chin area in particular.  Pores are more refined, skin is smooth.  Overall, the skin of the whole face seems smoother and more toned.  Keep in mind that I don't have acne and only a very minor issue with clogged pores and milia.  If I just threw away my magnifying mirror, that would take care of my problems because nobody else cares about my face.  Not even my DH of 46 years who listens to my complaints while no doubt thinking, "Doesn't she have something more important to worry about, like world peace or who the next US president will be?"  I like this.  I won't give it 5 stars because it's one of those products with a gazillion ingredients (well, there are 15 listed on the bottle).  I've become more of a purist about beauty products nowadays.  For example, the only facial moisturizer I use is either 100% pure rosehips seed oil or tamanu seed oil.  (Well, the bottles say "100% pure" and I'm hoping there's truth in that advertising.)  If this Effaclar clarifying toner had just 4 or 5 ingredients instead of those 15, I might give it 5 stars.  The price is right and the results have been good so far.	1
I gave this a shot when offered a chance as a Vine reviewer because I like two of the LaR-P 'foaming cleanser' products, one Effaclar and... I forget the name of the other. They come out of the tube as lotion but turn into a foam as you rub them between your hands and they work amazingly well. I'm a guy with an oily face and they remove all of the oil without feeling harsh.  I have occasional acne and have dermatologist-prescribed gel that works well (it's anti-bacterial and has peroxide, or something like that in it, as it bleaches my pillow-cases!) but I don't like to use it all of the time, and this toner, which I use before bed, seems to reduce how often I need to use the other stuff.  The only thing I don't care for is the scent. The cleansers seem to me to have no scent, but this does. It's not horrible, just unpleasant and it lingers for a bit.	1
While I'm sure this is a great product for teen acne, I can tell you firsthand that it is amazing for adult acne and those of us with an oil prone t-zone.  I'm always a little hesitant to use products like this on my 50 year old face, as the last thing I need on my cheeks is something that is drying. However, my nose and around my chin seem to hearken back to age 16, especially when under stress.  Been using this Clarifying Toner on those areas, and not only is there no irritation, there are also no blemishes right now. I've used the La Roche Posay line of products for years, but always depended on people coming back from France to bring them. So happy that the company is expanding so many of their products and making them available in the United States.	1
Toners are pretty standard across brands, featuring some amount of salicylic acid with inert or inactive ingredients like water and fragrances, and this is pretty much what you would expect: something that helps you shed your dermis at a faster rate, preventing clogs in the pores and buildup of dead skin and oils, as well as bacteria, the main causes of acne and breakouts. As with all toners, this one can make your skin a bit dry and photosensitive, so you sometimes have to use lotion, which can kind of bring you back to square one by irritating or clogging pores. (Basically, avoid comedogenic oils or lotions so you don't end up in a loop of over-drying, over-moisturizing, and then irritating skin.) Avoiding sun and using suntan lotion is also kind of a must if you are using this regularly.  That aside, and it applies to all toners, this works pretty well!	1
La Roche-Posay's Effaclar Toner is one of the few toners that contains glycolic acid that my skin tolerates. It's gentle on my sensitive skin -- I didn't experience any redness or stinging but the toner still helped to clear away the small pimples that were developing.  I use the toner with the cleanser and the cream and all 3 products work well together.	1
I'm not a teen, haven't been for many years, but I still get breakouts. These breakouts are primarily on my chin but I used this toner all over my face. I started with once a day since my skin in sensitive and I didn't want to dry it out. The results were noticeable, with the breakout I had clearing up and no others popping up.  So far, I haven't needed to increase to more than once a day. I use it at night, then moisturize like I normally do. Good results.	1
Mind you, I have skin that's on the dry side but I still get occasional breakouts due to various reasons. I also have a testy T zone with some struggles with congested skin, mostly due to my work. This toner is gentle on the skin even though it is alcohol based.... although I only apply it to my troubled spots, so I don't dry my skin out further in dehydrated areas.  This toner couples 2 "hydroxy acids; a Beta acid: Salicylic, and Alpha; Glycolic. These 2 acids together work very well to decongest the pores (both cause the cells to turn over more quickly to help heal acne). The percentage of acid(s) is just enough to do the job without causing major drying of the skin. I also use Retin A, and have not had any reactions or over sensitivity from Effaclar. That's pretty amazing, and a first for me with this type of toner. My skin doesn't feel "sting-y"  or tight after applying.  The fragrance is mild,  menthol is on the list of ingredients, and the scent of it is very faint. Effaclar has more of an acne medication type of fragrance, no flowery perfumes to worry about here. After application, it wears off quickly and is unnoticeable with my other facial products. It is recommended to wear a sunblock when using any acids on the skin since they can predispose the skin to sunburn, and possible spotting (called melasma) that can be difficult to get rid of.  As far as the effectiveness, I do notice a positive difference in my blemishes and my pores also seem smaller. Some congested areas with blackheads are gradually looking much better, especially around the nose and chin. I tend to get hormonal breakouts on the chin and I feel that this toner can do a great deal towards preventing my clogged pores from progressing to full blown pimples. So far, I'm very pleased with the results! This toner should not be considered a miracle worker in it's own right, for more blemished skin it should be used with a compatible cleanser and spot treatment at the very least. With my present routine it's just perfect (I have more mature skin that's sun damaged) and it works well for me. Highly recommended by this retired Paramedical Esthetician who can be very picky about her products. 5 stars & kudos to La Roche-Posay, they make very fine professional skin care products for the medical & spa setting and this product is a winner.	1
This bottle for review is not my first bottle of this toner. Both my daughter and I use it after having a good experience with other products from this brand. Long term it's proven to keep my occasional breakouts at bay and has cleared up my daughters skin without leaving it red like most of the other acne products we've tried for her have done. It's very gentle but is still effective. I'm not sure I'd choose this exact toner for very acne prone skin or to clear major breakouts, it's more of a preventative and something to clear up occasional minor breakouts. It's good for blackheads too, I haven't had anything noticeable enough for me to want to use a pore strip since I started using this several months ago. This bottle is a good size. I use it once a day and it's lasted nearly four months. I apply it with a cotton round every evening, it gets the dirt off well but if I wore make up that day I use micellar water first prior to using this.	1
I generally don't use toners but was excited to try this one by La Roche-Posay..  It is a nice toner that does not sting while you are using it and it also doesn't dry my skin out.  Many toners are too drying and this one leaves your skin feeling refreshed without drying it out.  I have occasional breakouts so I am hoping this prevents those.  The price is right on this toner also.	1
I am a 48-year-old woman who has combination skin (dry and oily in different places) and have never had good success with facial care products. This one has cleared my breakouts while not over drying my dry spots. I'm amazed!  Seriously, this is nothing like other brands' products (even high-end brands). It doesn't have an annoying scent, and a little goes a long way. I've been using this for about 2 weeks now. I love the results!	1
Haven't used it long but already notice improvements.  I do use it only once per day as I found that using it 2x/day (as suggested) is overly drying for my skin.	1
I've used many products from the La Roche-Posay line and have had good results. Being in my 50's, I don't have many wrinkles, but I still get acne...thanks to an oily complexion. This has salicylic acid, which works well for me. The glycolic acid isn't something I use often because of warnings of using it and being in the sun. I found that this toner made my skin feel clean and soft. It was a little drying, so I'll use it a few times a week. Quality brand. Recommended.	1
There is a lot to like about this clarifying solution. It does seem to do a nice job of reducing breakouts on my face. Breakouts have been a chronic problem for my sensitive skin. Since I have been using this product, acne is noticeably reduced and my skin becomes smoother and nicer looking as well. Also, it doesn't seem to dry out my skin as much as other toners that I have tried before.  I like it enough that it has now become part of my daily facial regimen. It goes pretty well with my regular facial cleanser. Overall, this product works as advertised and the price is reasonable.	1
I love this toner!  I used to use toner (astringent) by the gallon when I was younger, but found every brand way too drying now that I'm older and less oily.  Still have acne, though :(  I first tried this as part of a three-step Effaclar system and have since repurchased it many times. It makes my skin SO smooth. I'm guessing that's due to the glycolic acid, which many toners don't have. This clarifying toner plus Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment Cream have completely eliminated the blackheads on my nose!  Highly Recommend!	1
Great product for my skin with acne.	1
Very nice product Goes well with Vitamin C serum	1
I used this for a few years now and for some reason or another stopped. I went to my local spa to purchase a bottle and the price was way to high so I'm very happy it's Available here on Amazon. I definitely noticed my face was not as moisturized when I stopped using for a few months and now I am back to it. I use Image vital C cream in the morning along with this and the Vital c serum. At night after washing my face with Image ageless I apply Image Retinol and a thin layer of this over it and the results are amazing. My complexion in the morning is better my face has a natural bright color .I don't wear anything but lipstick and mascara. I don't feel I need it and I'm in my 40s. This combination works wonders for me and leaves my face smooth. I much rather save money by buying here than at any spa .This I have no doubt it is Authentic. I have used this product long enough to know it's the same that I purchased in spa. Only difference is the price. So that said I will keep purchasing Image products on Amazon.	1
A thirst-quenching drink for my face!  Never go a day without it!	1
This product works	1
I love all things "Image". These products are really great. I have reviewed this one before so obviously I have repurchased this one. It hydrates and plumps the skin. Can't go wrong here.	1
Helps me stay hydrated even here in Utah!	1
Makes my skin so soft, and my pores appear much smaller.	1
I have used this for a while.  It works great.	1
Love this product makes ones skin feel like velvet and it is moisturizing . This is a recent find for me .	1
Feels great	1
Love this product . I am just starting to switch to the Image line of facial products. So far I am enjoying all of them and a nice price point .	1
This product does as stated. A little goes a long way!	1
I am 50 1/2 (lol but true). My neck and jowls are showing signs of aging. Starting to sag as it were. I got this product for the super-hydration it promises. Well it works! I'm a long time Image product user and just love this line! But this product is superb! It really is. My face looks better, brighter and more full of life. As for taking care of the sagging (which isn't all too bad yet thanks to other Image products) this one helps when combined with a retinol product in the evening. Yes you can combine this with other Image products. Just go to their website: [...] and read up on this fantastic line. And no I don't sell them. I just endorse them because they have worked so well for me. And at the Image website you cannot buy these products unless you are licensed anyway. But it is a good source of information if you choose to start using the products. In my many years of trying so many other products, I have never been more pleased with what Image does for my skin! I will not waste my money ever again on all these gimmicks (Dr. OZ and Opera promises just to name a couple). I'm going to stick with what I know works. Especially for my aging skin.	1
This is my second bottle of this product and I must say, I really do like it a lot.  You can wear it as a moisturizer prior to applying your makeup and your skin looks just radiant.  I will keep buying this one for sure.	1
The Mia 1 works just as well as the Mia 2, it just doesn't have two speeds and it doesn't beep when you need to move it.	1
I love Amazon Prime, esp. Prime day(s) with all the deals, so I ordered this at the amazing price of $88.88 recently.  I was somewhat suspicious when it arrived 2 days later because nothing was plastic-wrapped (like its new), the brush powered up immediately (doesn't it have to be charged??), and the brushhead did not look right.  The bristles were more in distinct rows vs. "meshed together".  So I reviewed youtube videos, and mine did not oscillate like the ones on line, just vibrated.  So I took it to Sephora, and a knowledgeable Clarisonic salesperson showed me theirs, and sure enough theirs did micro-oscillations not just vibrations.  Mine appears legit according to, again, youtube videos, maybe these are just old ones they are trying to get rid of (that's what the salesperson thought).  I had it one day, it charged fine, numbers and markings all appear fine.  Just didn't work the same as the ones at Sephora.  So, I returned the Amazon one today and ponied up the extra cash for the Sephora one, a bonifide seller of these.  Motto:  Look at yours carefully if you bought from Amazon, esp. on Prime Day.  It may be fine, it may not be.  I don't believe mine was.  I've included a pic of what the brush SHOULD look like.	-1
This brush works fantastically.  It magnetically charges, so remains sealed and thus waterproof.  It has a single setting, but that single setting is plenty to get your face nice and clean and smooth.  The brush is way softer than I expected (softer even than most washcloths), but does a really really good job cleaning.	1
I have never tried any type of device like this on my skin before. I am older and have avoided wrinkles but I do have textural issues that came with menopause. I felt like my face became a mine field of irregular rough patches and age spots.  Bought this, the basic model, to try it out. I've been quite pleased.  My skin looks smoother and more even with just a few uses. Once imoisturize I am startled st the improvement. Far less noticeable rough or flaky skin. Age spots look less bumpy.  Had a difficult time using this around my nose (the vibration made me sneeze) and this model only gas a single speed do I can't low it down. I also felt for the price the charge cord should come with a plug.  Overall I am very pleased with the results. I look and feel like I had a facial. I have sensitive skin but this device has been gentle and non-irritating. Like it more than I anticipated.	1
Would order again!	1
could not live without it !	1
This is a good product that definitely makes my face feel soft and clean. However, I haven't seen much, if any, improvement in my acne. Also it's super drippy and messy when I use it because water gets stuck in between the brush and the device itself. I will continue using it because I do like the way it cleans my skin. But I don't think it's a miracle worker for me. :)	1
I like the ease of keeping in shower and cleaning my face. Its quick and convenient.	1
I purchased the clarsonic Mia a few months ago after trying almost everything under the sun and moon to clear up my acne. I am 35 and would still have regular (nonhormonal) breakouts...quite embarrassing and somewhat depressing as well! I bought the clarsonic after trying a knock off brand with no success...the other brand which was supposedly designed specifically for acne actually caused me to break out worse! I used the cleanser and brush that came with the system to start and get an idea of whether it would be worthwhile to keep going.  To my surprise the cleanser that came with the Mia actually did start clearing up my skin within a matter of weeks! I still had a few stubborn spots so I decided to try the acne cleanser and brush head and I am SO happy that I did! I am on my second full bottle of cleanser and have repurchased acne brush heads-I am now a believer that both the cleanser and brush head can make a significant difference in the success of clearer skin. I would like to note that no skin condition disappears overnight and that when you first start using any skincare system there may be problems that come to the surface--these are problems that should be worked through to be taken care of instead of hidden--when skin problems are hidden in my experience all that happens is the problem gets worse! I highly recommend this to anyone looking to clear up their skin. If you are unsure what might work best for your skin go into a beauty store that sells them and ask for their opinion on what might be the best products! I would post a picture of my skin but since I cannot find any before pictures it wouldn't show the vast difference :)	1
I'm often disappointed with other expensive brands claiming to help with age lines and skin problems, but this cream is fantastic! I immediately felt and saw results within a week! The little lines near my eyes have filled out giving back 5 years to my face! I would absolutely save up and repurchase this miracle cream.	1
I've seen noticeable improvement in my skin texture, tautness and color after 8 days of use.  I applied a liberal amount each night before bed, after washing with a natural fruit enzyme facial cleaner.  There was no greasiness to the cream, so it was a little difficult to determine how much to apply.  Nevertheless, I put enough on to and let it go to work.  The smell is almost none - so it could be used by a man as well as a women.  Based on the rate at which I'm using this, I imagine that 1 bottle would last 30 days of liberal use or could be stretched to a few months is used sparingly or only on troublesome areas.	1
As others have noted, this is definitely a good cream.  I like the fact that it has a nice, non-greasy texture and almost no smell.  I could definitely see/feel a difference in my skin from the minute I put it on.  It uses some quality ingredients and you definitely could not go wrong by using it.  That being said, the big negative is price.  At $130 a tube, you really have to decide if it is worth it.  There are some expensive creams that a little goes a really long way, but I did not find that with this cream.  It is a retinol cream so it is definitely effective, but here is where I get mixed feelings... I have been a ROC girl for awhile now.  I doubt that ROC has quite the retinol that this product does, but when you are comparing less than $20 to $130, you really have to ask if the price difference is worth it.  I will most likely continue to use this product but combine it with the ROC retinol moisturizer to try and mitigate the cost.	1
I only have 30 days to get my review up, so I'm rushing my assessment a bit.  I will be sure to update the review as time goes by.  I have enjoyed the product very much so far.  Particularly, I like that I don't have to use very much of it to get full coverage on my face.  It is not sticky or greasy at all and goes on clean and smooth with a very pleasant smell.  I don't know 100% about any changes in my skin or signs of aging, but I do know my skin "feels" better using this product.  I will continue until the full container is gone and see how it turns out.  But, right now, I'm very pleased with it and would try it again.	1
I wanted to use this for a couple of weeks before writing this review.  I've been blessed with good skin, but my age is beginning to show in creases, some dullness, and some darker pigment areas.  I was kind of shocked by the price this sells forI would never spend that much for a face creamso I wanted to see if it lived up to that price point.  First, I really like the scent:  it's not over-powering, kind of clean, and does not linger too long.  The lightweight cream/lotion glides on easily and really absorbs into my skin.  I've never used a retinol product but understand that one can often experience some irritation.  I have somewhat sensitive skin so was concerned about a possible reaction, but thankfully I had none.  My skin is noticeably smoother and feels very soft.  I don't think I've noticed a big difference (yet) with my dark spots, but some of the creases have definitely softened.  I appreciate that there are quality ingredients in this product.  If it wasn't so expensive I would consider repurchasing this product, but at the current price I just don't know if it's within my budget. For those not worried about the price, I'd recommend it highlyI do not think you'd be disappointed.	1
I have never used anything quite like this before, and I was struck by how delightfully creamy and smooth this product is...no heavy, goopy oiliness.  I haven't detected any fragrance at all. My skin has definitely felt so much more smooth and less dry (feels good!) in the weeks that I have been using this product. I read some articles about retinol that say the real "age defying" effects can take several weeks to be evident, but I am impressed already. My skin tends to be sensitive, but I've had no reaction to this aream.  My only reservations are (1) the price - it's a small tube, so I am using it sparingly, and (2) reading further, there is a warning that this kind of product shouldn't be used by women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  I will add to this review if and when I find noticeable changes in my skin. So far, highly recommended.	1
"Nia" stands for niacin, and if you search PubMed, you'll find that the doctors who founded Niadyne, creators of the Nia24 skin care line, have conducted extensive peer-reviewed research on the effects of niacin, and specifically niacin+retinol. If you want to use skincare that is backed by scientific evidence and a devoted fanbase, Nia24 deserves a place on your list.  As a longtime retin-a user who has no problem with the hard stuff, I really like this cream: the consistency, the mild scent, even the sturdy silver tube that is easy to spot in dim light. It's one of the few products I've tried that keeps working all night, so that I wake up without dry skin. My skin has improved dramatically in the last three weeks since I started using IRR, but that is probably due to the non-ablative laser treatment I had a couple of weeks ago. It may take me another month to decide whether this is a product I'll want to keep using, and that $130 pricetag is something of a deterrent, as reflected in a one-star deduction. If the choice were between a few tubes of this and a laser treatment, I know where I'd put my money.  IRR is not a miracle worker, and you're not going to wake up after a week looking 21, unless you happened to be 21 when you went to bed. But it's an effective moisturizer that hits a lot of the right notes in face care.	1
I think this product works okay - after using it for a bit, I can safely say that my skin looks a little better, but not overwhelming so.  I like the light scent - really airy so it doesn't feel like you're caking your face with something.  Another thing is that you can make a little go a long way while still feeling like you are getting good coverage, so you can make the tube last a decently long time (which considering the price is extremely good news!)	1
I've been using this for a couple of weeks now, and I really like it! It is more like a lotion than a serum, and it goes on smoothly. I use about a dime-sized amount for my face and neck. It also has a nice smell to it, which is more than I can say for some products I've tried. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I can see a noticeable difference in two problem areas. I am starting to get Crow's feet around my eyes, and I have wrinkles on my neck from weight loss. Both areas are starting to disappear. This gives me hope that with continued use, they will completely disappear. I highly recommend this product based upon my own results.	1
I have been using the cream for about 2 weeks. I do not have a lot of wrinkles (yet). I wanted to use the cream to see if the fine lines would disappear.  I really do not see any changes but my husband commented that I look less tired. The fine lines around my eyes seem to have filled out. The overall feel is good. I like the cream as it maintains my face hydrated and feeling good. I use the cream after I shower in the morning.  One of my concerns was that it might smell but to my surprise it has zero odor. Once it dries my face feels really good and I can put makeup on.  The cream is very expensive so you must decided if the price is worth it.	1
Intensive is the right word for this product. It's surprising. I've been using Nia 24's skin strengthening cream for a few years now and love it, so I'm a big fan of their products. Also, I exfoliate every day and have built up a good tolerance for most products that help slough off skin. I alternate between tretinoin and and AHA and AHB scrubs. I have good skin. The first time I used this, even though I know better, I went ahead and slathered on a good amount of the intensive retinol repair all over my face and neck. There was a slight tingling that developed over a few minutes, but not at first like most retinol creams will tingle, and it didn't last. I was fine for a day and then, bam, I had alligator skin for a few days as my skin went into hyper-exfoliation. I underestimated the strength of this product. After about five days, I ended up with very, very smooth skin that was much brighter and clearer than before. This is a very good product, but do not - seriously - do not use too much the first time. I recommend it, but just go easy the first few times.	1
Ok, for $130, I'm not so sure.  However, if I took the price out of it and just evaluated the product, it's very good!  I've been using it for about two weeks now and noticed less redness overall.  I tend to have a splotchy complexion.  I started slow as I know is advised with a retinol product and used it every 3rd night and applied only at night.  I had very little irritation other than some redness after applying (but good the next day) and a slightly "sunburned" feeling.  No peeling.  The next morning I was pretty oily as my skin has a tendency toward, but no breaking out.  I still feel like I need to apply my regular mineral powder makeup each morning as I still have some splotchiness in my complexion...however, I feel that overall it is better and it's only been 2 weeks.  I wish I had more time to use it before reviewing the product, but will try to come back to edit my review after it's been a couple of months.	1
This isn't exactly a high-retinol product, but its efficacy still remains impressive and for that I am grateful. The moisture is wonderful, the cream feels pretty good on skin, and a little goes a long way. I like the list of ingredients and the clarity and firmness it gives my skin after only a couple weeks' use. I use it as a night cream and have been pleased with the results. Intense repair? I'm not sure in that category. But it's a fine, fine treatment just the same.	1
Sometimes it is hard to differentiate what any one NIA24 product does, especially when using several of them every day.  The one thing that I have noticed since adding this to my cleaning and moisturizing routine is that my face is noticeably softer and stronger.  It is kind of interesting because I always think of my grandmothers soft skin when I touch mine, but hers was soft and paper thin.  Mine is soft and strong.  It feels great.  I have always been taught to put moisturizers on in the order of thickness, starting with eye creams and then the thinnest.  In order to do that with NIA24 products, I always start by putting several on the back of my left hand.  The skin on the back of my left hand is gorgeous.  I like the feeling of it being protected from the elements even before the yard work and sailing seasons start.	1
This foundation is easier to control than other liquid makeup I've tried.  It's comfortable to wear and feels breathable.  It has great wearability and lasts all day unless I exercise heavily or get caught in a lot of rain.  However, it washes off easily with regular face cleansers!  I have sensitive skin and this product hasn't caused any irritation or breakouts.  There's no obnoxious fragrance or chemical smell.  One caution: while this makeup is very blendable before it sets, once it does, it's not budging.  The best application method I've found is to dot the foundation over areas I want to cover and then blend with a foundation brush.  It seems a little too slippery for fingers.  Again, be sure to blend quickly as the foundation sets and stays!  Also, start with less makeup than you think you will need.  A little of this foundation goes a looong way.  I recommend this foundation!  It feels nice to wear and lasts all day.  And the pigments are really beautiful.	1
My wife like this liquid foundation as it gives a dewy effect to her skin. She also like the fact that there is SPF factor to this foundation. Great for keeping her make-up routine simple.	1
SO far, the best under-eye concealer to date.....and I have tried MANY.  IT does fall into lines if you use too much or you don't have a moisturizing under eye cream, but over all, I like it a lot.  Covers well.	1
My wife really loves this liquid foundation, it was easy to apply, stays the whole time, is even on her skin and caused no irritation to her (she's a person from the Indian subcontinent). She told to give it 5 stars	1
I liked this product, unfortunately it was too dark for my complexion.	1
I'm a huge Dermablend fan and this is one of their best products. I should admit that I hate using foundation and try to avoid it. However, there are days when I really need it, either because I have to look my best or because my skin is acting up. This is my go-to. It goes on so silky smooth that it's surprising to watch it cover every nasty flaw in its path. It covers like pancake makeup but goes on like a slick moisturizer. I dot on a bit of Dermablend Cover Creme if there's any sins that need a bit more cover and then use the Dermablend setting powder to create a matte finish and set the makeup in place.  Having this in my arsenal means I don't have to worry about those mornings when I have a big meeting or those evenings when I have to go somewhere fancy. I know that even if my skin looks terrible that day, Dermablend can make me pretty again.  Tip: Before you order any Dermablend products, order a free sample kit from the Dermablend website. The color matching is critical for this brand and you can't trust what you see on the monitor. You need to see the colors in person.	1
Wife says- Really good product. smooth in application and stays for about 3-4 hours. I do apply it in layers the very first time ensuring that the skin absorbs enough of it. I do not have sensitive skin but products that are low-quality tend to break out my skin. It's not the case with the Dermablend foundation. I apply it with a makeup puff, set it with Dermablend face powder and spray face mist, which helps it set on my skin beautifully.  It is indeed pricey, but same in the range of Clinique, and bare naturals. I've liked it just as much.	1
High medium to full coverage. Lasted well after setting with powder. I would recommend that you go into a store and try on shades before buying. The description, swatches, and the Dermablend website are not helpful. Note theres a significant jump in color from one shade to the next, either going lighter or darker. And, you really need to apply this and wait a few minutes to see if the color works after it has had a chance to interact with your body chemistry and heat. All foundations will settle to their true colors after being on the skin for a few minutes. The shade I bought was 25N. It did turn darker once set on my face. I can make it work but I wished there was a good shade match.	1
I admit that I was skeptical about the Dermablend Smooth Liquid Concealer Makeup.  Using it, however, I was pleasantly surprised.  I had previously been using a creme concealer that can be a little difficult to spread, thus stretching the delicate underage skin.  My face is fair, as I always use sunscreen. I have been using this under my (60+ year old ) eyes and it does a good job.  It should be noted that this product is very thin and a lot goes on with one brushstroke; so I blended the excess on some other areas of uneven skin tone on my face.  I experienced zero skin irritation.  I did not reapply at any time during the day.  Sometimes I wore it alone and sometimes with makeup over it.  I don't know if you applied it in the morning if it would last all day, as that is not my normal usage. I am happy with this product and glad to recommend it.	1
I am a long-time user of Dermablend. I have used their Quick Fix concealer stick in Beige for the last few years. I was excited for the opportunity to try a new formulation from the same brand. I debated between Sesame (Light) and Biscuit (Fair). I chose Sesame. My initial reaction was that the product was very easy to apply. The wand type applicator meant less mess than the stick method. I blended it with a damp Beauty Blender sponge (my usual method) and found that it made the coverage very sheer. The next day I blended with my finger and got much better coverage. My main concern is with undereye circles. I felt like the Liquid Camo concealer did a fair job of covering them up and staying in place throughout the day. It did not settle in the lines of my skin like some liquid concealers have. It lasted for 12+ hours when set with powder. I won't, however, be switching from my old concealer by Dermablend. The coverage of this one is moderate....definitely not heavy. I also feel that the wand applicator adds additional convenience but at the cost of wasted product. I can see how this tube wouldn't last as long as the stick concealer because you can't get to the sides once the liquid gets low. I still prefer this new Liquid Camo over the multitude of brands I've tried over the years.  By the way, attached picture is taken in daylight with no filter. I took it to compare the color and coverage of my usual DB Perfect-Fix stick concealer and their new product, this Liquid Camo concealer.	1
As concealers go, it does a fairly good job. Patting it on works best for coverage of dark circles and carefully applying foundation over it.  I've used it over foundation as well, as a hurry-up way of hiding some of the shadows or freckles.	1
Does not blend well, it comes off easily. Had to reapply my whole foundation 2 hours later.	-1
This is a very nice concealer. It goes on smooth and blends well with regular foundation and makeup. It does a pretty good job of concealing the age spots and evening the skin tone. Good coverage with a matte finish. Didn't feel it's thick or cakey, which is nice. The wand applicator helps target the desired areas. No irritation so far. Great product.	1
I thought this did a great job on coverage and long lasting.  This color match great with my skin tone (I always like my concealer to be brighter and whiter than my skin) to help brighten my eye.  This does a good job covering up  my under eye circles and gave a good amount of coverage.  I didn't feel it was at all cakey and went on very smoothly.  I set it with their Camo Powder.	1
I have light Asian skin, and the Sesame Light worked well with my skin tone. It's a nice quick concealer that covers minor blemishes like acne to a small degree. It was a bit harder to cover my age spots however, even though it did lighten some of the age spots. I didn't feel like it was oily, in fact it felt light and easy to blend.	1
I wanted to try this concealer for the dark circles under my eyes. I've have not found anything that will cover them. The Dermablend did help to cover the dark circles but not completely. It could be that I didn't have the correct color or that my dark circles can only be covered completely by a professional make-up artist. I did notice a difference with the Dermablend so that is something. I would recommend applying a lot of moisturizer before using this product as it does highlight any dry or flaky skin.	1
Nice coverage and no rash. The ingredients seem good for a make-up product.  Very smooth and refined, not chunky.  The color works really well, but all colors are subjective. Kind of hard to tell how it will work in a computer screen.  Overall very satisfied.	1
This is a very heavy cover-up that feels heavy on your face. Im  used to more of a tinted moisturizer, this feels like a heavy paste Im smearing on my face.  Gets into all the cracks and crevices of my face and makes me look older than wearing no make up at all! Color does not go well with my skin tone either.  Would not recommend	-1
To me, it felt very "heavy" on my skin.  I typically use Aveda's foundation and this just felt like my pores were clogged.	-1
The scent alone of this foundation just lost all points.  It was off-putting enough to use once and not want to try it again.  The color is quite reddish/orange in undertone, making it a challenge to look natural.	-1
Works really well. Great coverage. Long lasting. Very nice product.	1
I like this foundation but it is somewhat reluctant to blend into my ultra-dry skin.  As a result, it looks kind of patchy.  I think if you have normal skin, it would work better.	1
This is a fuller coverage Dermablend than the ones that I have previously tried. It is a little thicker, but blends nicely and provides a great coverage and foundation. The coppery shade that I am using blends nicely with my darker olive-toned skin to give it a natural sort of tanned look without being an Orange Face White Neck. It doesnt have an overly thick or cakey feel to it, either, and instead has a pretty lightweight feel, though it is thicker than some of the other foundations that I wear. Because of this, though, it isn't my go-to day-to-day makeup, so it feels special when I put it on, and extra pretty!	1
I got this for my wife to try out, and she said it is an excellent foundation. Easy to use, covers well, and lasts long. It covers up blemishes and light discoloration. The only issue is that getting a skin color match; the coloring is strong, so you have to make sure it will match your tone.	1
This foundation offers fairly good coverage. I felt like it blended into my skin easily. It did feel a little bit heavier than what I am accustomed to wearing (I typically prefer a lightweight tinted moisturizer), but it did a good job of covering blemishes and evening out my skin tone. It also did a fairly good job of lasting throughout the day. It does provide a nice, smooth finish.	1
Foundation choice is fairly personal, so this review is how my skin interacted with this product.  I am a mid-40s female with a few smile lines.  This foundation clumped right into them and made them more noticeable.  The color based on the directions ended up too dark and too yellow.  The coverage was not bad, not entirely sheer; however, it didn't do much to minimize my bit of rosacea.  I can't recommend this product.	-1
I got this foundation for my daughter, so this review is her opinion.  This foundation is complete coverage.  It easily covers flaws and skin discoloration.  You will only need a small amount and a little goes a long way.  It goes on easily and can be applied with fingers, sponges or brushes.  My daughter's skin is oily, so she has to use a setting powder with this and it still may need to be reapplied for all day wear.  This color has a nice neutral undertone.  I was surprised since the name is cinnamon I expected it to be reddish although I know that color names are irrelevant.  This is another great product by Demablend!	1
Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation was thicker than I usually wear so that surprised me, but it went on smoothly and covered well.  The tint was perfect for me and the makeup looked so good.  It wasn't messy or difficult to put on.  It wore well throughout the day and since it's summer, oil from my skin didn't break through and look greasy.  I didn't need any more powder than the amount I put on in the morning after I apply foundation.  Great makeup l definitely buy again.	1
The color is right as I expected. Even though the foundation contains titanium dioxide for sunscreen, it does not feel oily at all. It has more dry consistency, and it takes some effort to apply to skin evenly. But it covers all the redness and other imperfections on my skin very well, so it is well worth the effort.	1
It took me some time to find the exact shade for me since I couldn't find it in stock at my local Sephora and my color IQ didn't seem to produce a perfect match.  But once I found the right shade, I really like this foundation.  It's described as medium to full coverage and to me, that's pretty accurate.  I wasn't sure how I would like so much coverage as I've been gravitating towards lighter tinted moisturizers like Laura Mercier or mixing my CoverFX Custom Cover Drops with cream to make a sheer foundation.  Generally lighter foundation has been fine for me since my aging skin means full coverage can sometimes be unflattering and my skin is nice enough that it generally doesn't require a lot of makeup.  But this surprised me.  Even though it covers a great deal, it doesn't accentuate my fine lines and sometimes dry skin and wears well throughout the day.  I've been wearing it when I want a more polished evening look with a full face of makeup and it is perfect for those occasions.  For daytime wear I still prefer something more softer and natural but when I'm going for a bold lip or a smokey eye, this foundation provides me a perfect canvas to start from.  I also think this applies pretty effortlessly.  I've tried my fingers, a foundation brush, and my beauty blender and liked how it looked with all 3.  I also didn't have any trouble taking it off at the end of the night with facial cleaning wipes or my standard face wash.  It definitely takes some time to find your shade (and with this level of coverage you need to), but once you find it, it's an excellent product.	1
This is a GREAT color for darker skin! In summer months I move up to a darker shade and this makes my skin look so clear and lovely. I apply with a beauty blender and the formula blends perfectly.  I apply in the early AM and when I return from work my skin still looks great and blemishes I have are still concealed.  This formula is for more full coverage, compared to medium. So far after using for two months super happy with this and another DermaBlend shade I received!	1
I tried two shades, 30w Bisque for nighttime or summer when I have a tan, and 25n Natural for day time and winter months when my pale Irish skin can verge on florescent, Both worked great. They went on super smooth, blended easily and as lightly as a day lotion. not sticky at all - I highly recommend for when you are looking for light foundation that gets the job done. Blends into my skin flawlessly.  Both are true to what you see on your screen.	1
Smooth make up  This make-up goes on smoothly and blends in with your complexion  it does hide many imperfections. Very dark imperfections do not cover as well. It does not cake in creases as the day goes on. The chestnut colour is lighter than one might expect and the and the cocoa is darker. Once you find one that matches your complexion you will be happy with the coverage.	1
This would have been great but the shad is just too dark for my skin. I did like the coverage and I love that it didn't make my pores look larger or my fine lines look worse. Very easy to use, and it did a great job along with the concealer stick to cover up sun spots. I've been pretty happy with this brand.	1
Worked for me not as full face makeup, but as a concealer.  A little bit goes a long way and there is a learning curve, but once that's out of the way, the product works great.  Lots of choices of colors and I found going into a store and seeing them first-hand works the best for me.  After that, I order online.	1
The Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation was a little thicker than I expected it to be. At first I thought it was going to be smoother and work better but it was so thick. It seemed to cake a little when I applied it. The color and pigmentation of the foundation was more on the warmer side. They had undertones of orange yellow red so on and so fourth. If that is your complexion, maybe it will work better for you.	-1
I absolutely LOVE Dermablend makeup line. They have truly come up with a foundation and concealer that blends amazingly. There is never that caked on layered look. I like that I can build on top of it and have that flawless blend that I have always sought after with my makeup but have not been able to obtain until now. This particular stick matched amazingly with my own skin tones and blended in just as well. It is so easy to apply. You just open by twisting the top and you squeeze some out on a finger or a sponge and apply like you would any other makeup. SO I got one that did match my skin tones and the coverage is AMAZING, The concealer sticks along with the smooth camo foundation covers all my blemishes and skin irritants flawlessly. That really helps boost a girls self esteem when she can look in the mirror and her cystic acne is being well covered, Dermablend is created by certified dermatologist which is great because they know how to keep irritants out of the makeup they are creating, My skin doesn't breakout like it does with supermarket makeup when I use the Dermablend, I couldn't ask for a better makeup line to have fallen in love with.	1
This product is so good and worth every penny spent on it.  The moment you apply you will notice that it is really super smooth and easy to apply - maybe the titanium dioxide ? And that is what it makes it so expensive maybe.  It blends very well into the skin - I would suggest buying 2 shades to reach the right color you need.  It was easy to apply with fingers and do make sure to wash your finger and remove the makeup once you are done for the day.  The foundation also comes with SPF 25 - while not great, it is good for most days.	1
I discovered Dermablend here on Amazon.  I really like the liquids.  They blend in well and last for many hours without feeling heavy.  Some liquids suffocate the skin.  I don't get that sensation with this brand.  The stuff doesn't irritate the skin, either.  I appreciate the lack of any added perfumes, too.	1
There s gives a smooth finish without looking caked on or settling I. The cracks. Don't forget to set it with powder. It has a thick but not tacky feeling.	1
Dermablend's liquid camo foundation goes on easily. It provides great coverage without feeling caked on. The manufactor recommends finishing with their setting spray. I was a bit put out that a second product was needed to achieve the advertised results.	1
The Sepia skin tone is the right one for me during the summer months.  The liquid Camo covers well and lasts long.  I have broken capillaries near my nose and it covers those.  It also blends the uneven skin tones that I have on my face.  It works well with both the oily and dry patches of my skin.  This is definitely a product I will continue to use in the future.	1
I've used foundation for many years.  I've mostly used Clinique because it's rather reasonably priced &  works good.  But, now I've found Dermablend & I love it!  I've used several Dermablend products & I've loved them all. I have uneven skin tone & age related wrinkles & I've found that Dermablend works better for me than any other product I've used before.  I will continue to use Dermablend!	1
This medium coverage foundation blends easily with your skin.  Just a single coat applies enough coverage.  It does not feel greasy at all.  Does not have any scent, which is good.  Very light and not heavy and doesn't cake.  A small amount goes a long way.  This particular color, copper, was a good match for my girlfriend's skin and she is from the Philippines.  It will conceal flaws, SPF 25 provides protection from the sun, and it can also make you look more tanned than you are.  Obviously, select the right color.  So, pretty good stuff, but just be aware of the aforementioned limitations.  5 stars.	1
This is another great Dermablend product!  Here's what I like about it:  It blends well. I recommend using a beauty blender or brush, & you don't have to use alot. It goes on nicely, and a little bit goes a long way. I've found this to be true with other Dermablend makeup as well. It's a little more pricey than other brands, but it's a professional product & I feel like I use less product than I do with other brands. I did not have any issues with breakouts or irritation. Highly recommend this Smooth Liquid Camo, as well as other Dermablend products. It's a quality brand.	1
Excellent coverage without being too cakey. You can easily layer with the rest of your face make up products and the finish is still very nice. No cracking and just doesn't appear too heavy in general. It goes on smooth with more of a matte finish. Applies great with a brush or blender. Everything still looks great at the end of the day too. Doesn't dry out or irritate fussy skin. Doesn't cause break outs, which is usually a huge problem with foundations. Tried so many that just caused too many skin problems from dry patches to horrible little pimples all over the chin area etc. This one doesn't do any of that. Feels like it still let's the skin breathe while still having great coverage.	1
Review of: "Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Medium to High Coverage Foundation Makeup with SPF 25, 80N Cinnamon, 1 fl. oz.," by Dermablend.  This is an excellent concealer.

Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation contains SPF 25 Titanium Dioxide Sunscreen  Be sure to read the 'How to Find Your Shade' section.  It's informative & helpful.  First off, I'm a senior citizen who doesn't have many wrinkles.  This foundation is easy to apply & covers my light colored freckles & my blue/green veins.  My skin looks smoother & a bit younger. I didn't receive their setting powder to review so I'm not sure how applying it would affect the overall look and how long it will wear.  This foundation is not drying &  doesn't cause any irritation.	1
The Dermablend Liquid Camo Copper colored foundation worked very well at evening out my skin tone and hiding blemishes on my skin.  The foundation was easy to apply, went on smoothly, and lasted for almost the entire day without needing reapplication.  While this foundation works well, it's important to slowly layer on - this makeup can easily cake on if you use too much at once!  The copper color looked good on my skin, but when in the sun I noticed that the makeup had an orange tinge to it.  If you can get samples of the product before purchasing, you will get a better color match - it's definitely advised as the color difference between the makeups is very subtle.  You can also blend your foundation with other colors to get a more perfect match.  One thing I didn't care for this makeup is that this one seemed to settle more into my wrinkles and fine lines more than the Dermablend Blurring Mousse.  While it wasn't enough to be a deal breaker, I am aware of a better foundation, and this one just wasn't as good as the other formula.  Overall, this a good foundation that offers great coverage.	1
The grand daughter loves the liquid camo foundation for covering her freckles and the cocoa is dark enough to blend in with her summer skin tone. She says it's easy application and it lasts all day on her.  She's very happy with it and told me to tell you guys that for cover-up it works great!!  Now to ship a case to Doris Day (oh yes,  she's still very much alive at 94 I believe).  The grand daughter's been using it everyday this summer.  I can attest to that, so she must like it and I know she's ordered more.  I guess that qualifies as an endorsement by action, not words.  Five Stars!	1
This is lightweight, even & easy to apply and smooth. The added benefit is spf 25! I live it & its been a great addition to what I already own.	1
This is some of the best! It goes on so smooth and gives me the coverage I need. I highly recommend it!	1
For whatever reason, the current formulations of Dermablend products don't seem to do what Dermabelend formulations of the past have done. They are still good but not as effective as previous incarnations.  This one is pretty good, overall, though, and it can be used as either a base to cover imperfections first before applying foundation. I thought it would be too heavy for that but it does work. On its own, it may not provide the full coverage for bad scars or other issues but on me, it did a nice job of calming down the look of redness I get after working out. I can work out, shower and apply this without added foundation on top of it and go to work without looking like a full-on tomato.  It blends well and the shade was light enough for my pale skin. Its still a good option for minimizing common skin issues but it won't cover everything.	1
This is a high coverage product. I can certainly see why it is used to cover scars and blemishes. It really does a great job. It covers tattoos and numerous other things you want to hide. It comes in a wide variety of colors. It is easy to apply, and lasts all day. Use a make up remover.	1
This foundation is absolutely amazing! I highly recommend it! It has amazing coverage and even though it's a high coverage foundation it doesn't feel very heavy. I apply it in the morning over my moisturiser and it really lasts until I take it off at night. I also noticed it keeps my normal to oily skin matte and it does a pretty good job at covering my large pores too.	1
I wasn't sure that I'd like this, but it's really a nice formula. It goes on evenly with a blender sponge, and trouble areas only need to be tackled with an extra pat or two. I don't apply from the nose out (I think that's what the directions say?), I go from the forehead down. The setting powder is recommended, but I've used several different types and they've all worked well. My husband complimented me on the way my skin looked, he said it looked very natural - not oily, cakey, or too matte.	1
Another Dermablend hit. It doesn't require a lot of product, is full coverage, and if needed, is build-able for more coverage.  It doesn't have a scent nor does it irritate my skin. If you set it appropriately, it does last a while. This product hides blemishes well such as acne, redness, and sun spots. Offers a good amount of SPF as well.  Overall a wonderful product and brand.	1
We have three massive make-up cases just for cosplay. And, since I have been the designated make-up person for the last five years ... I can tell you that nothing beats Dermablend. In fact, the entire lower-tier of one of my huge train-cases is just filled with their products. You can buy cheaper but you'll end up layering three times as much product and it will not appear even remotely natural. You simply cannot buy better!  This foundation is perfect since it allows me to easily cover any blemishes my subject may have as well as any birthmarks/beauty marks (I even had one person with a star-shaped tattoo near her eye ... it easily covered it). And, what I really love is how once I have a clean canvas (one perfectly created by Dermablend), I can layer over regular make-up (or more extreme cosplay make-up) without pilling, rolling, or smudging. Powders, highlighters, creme blush ... all go on bright and clean. I can even do fine line-work ... and the lines go on sharp, and stay sharp!! I cannot say any other brand is as forgiving as Dermablend.  Finally, Dermablend lasts until you remove it. We have used this for full days of photo-shoots and panels ... and it just stays put! (It's best to use a make-up removing cloth to gently remove it and then move on to a light cleanser like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Liquid-Neutrogena-Facial-Cleansing-Formula-8-Fl-Oz/dp/B003BMI628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Liquid Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Formula, 8 Fl. Oz</a>&nbsp;with a Clarisonic. This seems to REALLY do the trick!) So, if you are worried about reapplying throughout the day, that has never been my experience or the experience of my subjects. Apply it for the day and forget about it!  Dermblend is dermatologist recommended and works like a dream. I have never had one subject have any sort of reaction ... ever! That says a lot about these products! Please, do not be put-off by the price ... a little goes a long way for most everyone. So, start light and then build up the coverage slowly ... most likely, you will use less than you thought you would need.  I have used Dermblend for years! It is the best, bar none!	1
.I chose this product to review because I have a very pale age spot about 1/4" x 1/2" on my cheek.  It's not very noticeable, but I thought this could make it disappear completely.  Wrong.  The Honey Beige shade is a pretty good shade, but it has too much red tone in it for me.  That said, I still wanted to see if it would cover.  It did not.  It actually made it more visible.  So I will not use this product.	-1
This is just an awesome foundation if you're looking for a lot of coverage on oil-prone skin. My skin is on the oily side and I have some red areas, so I tried first just a drop to hit the trouble spots. But a drop was all I needed for my whole face. It blends very smoothly with fingers, and gives a smooth finish with a slight dewy look (probably the inevitable result of the mineral sunscreen). It wore very well throughout the day, and I had unintentionally chosen one of the hottest/muggiest days to try it out. Admittedly for the first 30 min or so I felt the product on my face, but I stopped noticing after that.  Highly recommended if you want a foundation that covers.	1
This Dermablend liquid foundation is very highly pigmented. It provides a full coverage. I was able to cover up fairly dark markings quite well. It doesn't feel as moisturizing. It also dries very quickly when you apply, so you need to smooth this on quickly to get an even coverage. I had a hard time finding just the right shade for my skin, but once I did, this gave really good coverage.	1
I really like the way this make-up comes out by squeezing the tube and the opening is smaller than the end of a ball point pen. That way you get only what you want or need. I have purchased other high-end foundations that come in a pump bottle that gave me way more product than I wanted. I always feel like I am wasting money when I don't use all the make-up being pumped out. The tip design on this is easier to control and made so that you get out only what you need and want. The make-up itself is more of a cream. It has the feel of medium weight foundation, but the coverage is amazing. I am older and have inherited the family trait of dark circles under my eyes that seem particularly bad in the mornings. I also have a few minor sun spots and this make-up did a great job of smoothing out the skin tones without looking thick and heavy. It has a broad spectrum sunscreen of SPF 25. It has more of a matt finish so that you notice other parts of my face like eyes and lips, and not my foundation.	1
It's been some time since I've used liquid foundation (being a fan of powder foundation for my particular complexion), and I am pleased to consider this an option for me. My skin is pretty normal and boring, and this glided on easily without any cakiness or running. The color was strong on pigment, so that is something to be considered. It's staying power is impressive, and this is one I can put on in the morning and still maintain a look all day.	1
I've tried several of the Dermablend foundations and this one is my favorite.  MY MAKEUP and Me -- I'm an older mom with super sensitive skin which is also dry these days... except on my forehead.  I don't wear a lot of makeup by preference.  My life just doesn't demand it now, but there are times when I go out that I would like freckles, small red veins, and whatnot covered.  And while other Dermablend foundations covered they were too thick and heavy and I guess now that I don't wear makeup every day, I'm sensitive to the weight.  THIS foundation though was light and had good coverage. I really liked the narrow tip that it dispenses from. It is liquid and very very easy to apply.  It didn't irritate my skin at all.  It also wasn't greasy.  It finishes as a nice matte.  The only place where coverage wasn't perfect for me was on my forehead.  Note that it's in the mid-90s outside and the humidity is very high.  And I've found that if I don't want to look shiny I need to dust a little free powder over the foundation on my forehead.	1
My tan-complection Filipina wife LOVES Dermablend.  She has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  It turns out fantastic the way she does it.  I wish I could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  I've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful SPF to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).  She's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the USA and has tried many products to stop them.  The only thing that has worked was going back to Philippines for 3 months.  We have no idea if it's something in the ingredients of something she eats here, or some sort of spray on the vegetables... but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of Dermablend products.  She has 5 different creams, a couple of powders and 2 sticks, varying shades of tan.  She can apply them very quickly now, but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such.  I'm pleased that Dermablend is available for people like her, though it's a little expensive for the amount you get (my frugal opinion).  She's worth it!  Afternote:  I asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they don't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion YouTube tutorials.	1
Dermablend is a wonderful, high quality brand of cosmetics. The foundation is high coverage and great for sensitive skin. It is fragrance free and lasts many hours. It also has SPF 25!  I put some on my face with my (clean) fingers, blend it, and then set it with a little loose powder - that's it! It hides my blemishes very well (including sun spots and acne). One layer is enough for me and provides enough coverage, however it is definitely build-able if you need more coverage. It blends in very smoothly and comes out flawless each time.  Highly recommended!	1
This makeup is for covering smal imperfections such as scars or bruises. it does last a long time. It is easy to apply, comes in a variety of colors and is easy on my skin.	1
Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo foundation is one of the best foundations I've tried. It's excellent for summer weather as it has a broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunblock with an SPF 25 and contains titanium dioxide instead of harsher chemicals typically used in sunscreens. Also, this foundation is a nice medium consistency that's easy to work with so I get a smooth and even application even when quickly applied with my fingers. It provides excellent coverage of imperfections (including an age spot that's tough to cover and a small area of vitiligo on my face). Dermablend makes my skin tone look so even and has such a nice soft matte finish that isn't shiny or greasy.  I'd describe my skin as fair and "neutral" as it has an olive tone (though my face also gets has a hint of pink), and the camel shade couldn't be more natural looking and perfect for me. I'm in my 50's with dry, sensitive skin and use this foundation over my serum and face cream, and it doesn't highlight my fine lines like some other foundations. I think it's a really complimentary foundation and have received numerous compliments. It's a really nice product whether I'm doing full make up or just want some natural looking coverage and sun protection for a casual outdoor activity. I'm really happy with the quality of this foundation and the camel color. 5 stars.	1

Per my wife, the product is very creamy, but it makes face look almost dewy not matte like I and most prefer. It feels very lightweight and not cakey at all. It provides great coverage but did not cover my pores well, I found that it works best with setting powder if you have oily skin like myself. Over all a decent product, cannot say enough about the Dermablend line, but deducted one start for the dewy look and pore coverage.	1
Beautiful coverage that doesn't look or feel heavy. This shade was a little lighter than I was expecting, but still workable, especially with a little bronzer.  The coverage is medium and it lasts all day with a little setting powder (the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dermablend-Loose-Translucent-Setting-Powder-for-Up-to-16-Hours-of-Coverage-Original-1-oz/dp/B0002RI2PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dermablend Loose Translucent Setting Powder for Up to 16 Hours of Coverage, Original, 1 oz.</a>&nbsp;is an excellent powder to use with is or any foundation). The finish is matte, but not flat looking. Overall, this is a great long wear foundation for normal to oily skin.	1
Overall I like this foundation and recommend it. You only need to use a very small amounttoo much wipes out all color in your face, which is great if you want to start from a blank slate ^^ but for a more natural look, use a glob about the size of a coriander seed definitely smaller than a pea, anyway.  Pros: - Covers smooth and even - Lasts the day - SPF is good  Cons: - Oily. I broke out using this the first two times; the third time, when I used much less, things went better, but I also put some powder on top to bring down the oiliness and Im pretty sure that is whats helping.	1
This is another shade that was too dark for me. However, I did find a color that worked. I recommend using a primer first to make this foundation go on easily. I like to use it sparingly, so it looks more natural. A friend said my complexion looked flawless, so keeping this one.	1

I have medium tones of Southeast Asian ethnicity. My skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.  Honey 45W was too dark for the skin on my face. It didn't really match, not even on my much tanner legs.  Too much red and brown, not enough yellow undertone as the name "honey" might suggest. However, as I stated for my review for Camel 30N, the product itself is very easy to apply, very smooth and liquidy - not too thick. Camel 30N was great for my undereye area and concealed my dark circles satisfactorily. Once you get a great match for your skin, I would recommend this product as a good every day foundation/concealer for very minor skin imperfections, especially with the 25 SPF.	1

I have medium tones of Southeast Asian ethnicity. My skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.  Despite being in the "warm" class, I was pleasantly surprised with how the Camel 30N looked. It was easy to apply, very smooth and liquidy - not too thick. I used it mainly for my under eye and cheek area and it looked quite natural. I have some dark sun spots on my nose and so I tried the liquid camo on them but it did not fully conceal. As this is medium coverage, I expected that. It did fairly cover my under eye dark circles to my satisfaction. I love the 25SPF coverage. With setting spray only, this lasted all day and looked great heading into the evening.	1
This is a really small tube of moisturizer. It is only 1 ounce. And to sell it for about $50 I would expect it to do a lot more than just moisturize. After using is for a few weeks, I have to say I am not impressed. The lotion is lightweight, which I like. It also contains sunscreens, which I like. However, it did not really do anything noticeable for my dark spots. Therefore, I cannot justify the cost of continuing this after my Vine sample runs out.	-1
I wish I had something to report but after a few weeks, this hasn't done one thing for the dark spots - some small scar residue, some freckles and some other non-freckle spotting - I applied it to. I don't know how long it's supposed to take for a noticeable difference to occur but other products make claims that theirs produce results within shorter time frames so I assume it's possible to achieve results within less time than I used this. I just know I'm a little frustrated that I used this religiously on top of skin treatments I already use religiously, and nothing happened beyond some over-moisturizing.  I actually WILL continue to give this a chance for another couple of weeks to see if it'll do something and if there's any change at all, I'll come back and adjust my rating.	-1
I have fair, sensitive skin and this product, while light and absorbent, also irritated my skin. It tingled/burned when I initially applied it so I stopped using it after about a week. I usually don't have trouble with high-quality skin products but this one just wasn't comfortable.  It absorbs well and is a lightweight cream with little to no scent. But just not for my sensitive skin.	-1
I picked up a few sunspots at the beach this summer, despite trying to keep protected with sunscreen, and this took care of them within a couple of months or so. Granted, they were fairly new and not extensive, and I'm not sure whether they would have hung around without treatment, but I feel fairly certain this product at least helped them disappear more quickly and completely.  This does make a good base coat for makeup. I've experienced no irritation other than mild tingling on the very first application, and that's possibly because I also used an AHA product at the same time. Also, I've seen no breakouts that I connect with the use of this moisturizer.  Finally, as with most products with SPF, I assume this is protecting as claimed, but can't really verify.	1
I can only rate this as far as my two-week use of it will go. I have to say that I do see a slight difference in dark spots. I have been taking very the best care of my skin that I possibly can, and this product from La Roche-Posay seemed to add positively to the effect that care produced. Have dark areas disappeared? Not really, but I think time may produce increased value for my purposes. There is some fading, and I am looking for increased change with longer use. Thus far, I would say recommended.	1
Every dermatologist I've ever talked to agrees that the starting point of maintaining more youthful skin is protecting it from sun damage. Broad spectrum SPF of at least 30 is recommended, which this happily contains. It spread over my skin very easily without any uneven chalkiness and was absorbed remarkably quickly without leaving any greasy residue. But many other products do the same thing. What attracted me to this cream was the claim of helping to erase dark spot discolorations. Looking over the ingredient list as a nonscientist, I still noticed there were no ingredients specifically designed to dye or lighten the skin. That's a good thing as I've read cautionary warnings about those chemicals.  What's the science behind this product then? From my unprofessional eye, it seems to lie in a twofold approach. First I noticed two types of mild acid, especially salicylic . These help loosen upper layer dead skin sells for exfoliation.  The other most notable ingredient being niacinamide, (vitamin B3). Past reading of scientific research on B3 supports the claim of it's ability to rejuvenate skin to a more healthy youthful appearance.  On the minus side, the second ingredient listed is alcohol, which universally is considered a drying agent for skin that can cause irritation and flaking. All that being said, did I find any difference after a few weeks of daily use. Though a few weeks is a brief time, I can report seeing a subtle difference in my skin and perhaps the beginnings of sun spot lightening. From my brief usage, can I recommend this cream/ serum? Despite the alcohol I would say yes, due to it's protective SPF, ease of absorption and noticeable results. Why just 4 start and not 5? The price is a bit high, and I believe the main results are attributable to the Niacinamide. Do a search on Niacinamide creams on Amazon and you will find several offerings that come in higher concentrations in larger quantities at a fraction of the price. I won't recommend any in particular though I have tried several and found the results they produced remarkable. Of course, if you choose to buy one of those instead, you still need to purchase a high quality broad spectrum SPF of 30 or more for protection. Everyone's skin and sensitivity is different, of course, so the results of any product vary widely. As an all in one solution, albeit a bit expensive it's worth purchasing to see your particular results. For those who want to experiment, I would also encourage trying other Niacinamide creams to see how they react with your skin. Additionally, I personally have found remarkable results with night creams containing glycolic acid, my present favorite being Glycolix 20% facial cream, which has been very effective in encouraging exfoliation, though, always start with a milder percentage and work higher to build a tolerance and note your individual reaction.	1
Dark spots are most often caused by the sun.  We all know that we should wear sunscreen everyday, even when it rains. Most of us still don't unless it's already in a product we use, like our moisturizer.  La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Dark Spot Correcting Moisturizer is fragrance free. It smells to me like a sunscreen. In fact, the four main ingredients listed on the box are sunscreen. The good thing is it doesn't feel like a sunscreen.  It goes on much smoother like a moisturizer. It has ingredients in the product to also minimize the dark spots that I currently have.  I have only been using the Dark SpotCorrector for a couple weeks, so I haven't seen drastic changes in my existing dark spots. That isn't to say this won't help over time as I continue to use the moisturizer. The good thing is that by using the La Roche- Posay moisturizer I have been getting SPF 30 protection daily. My last moisturizer was only SPF 15.  This moisturizer is thicker & creamier than my previous SPF15 moisturizer. It being fall/winter time my skin actually needs a thicker moisturizer. This La Roche-Posay is a product I would recommend to a friend.	1
This product is nice for wearing during the day. I'm not really sure what makes it "Pigmentclar", but it's pretty moisturizing, spreads really well despite the tiny amount that they give you (the needle nose applicator helps), and it has SPF as well!  Slight "sunblock" smell, but pretty neutral.  Careful on your first squeeze, as it shoots out. Don't want to waste the entire ounce they give you one shot!	1
I have a few dark spots on my face (mostly reddish/brown and about a pea size).  I used this for about a week and started to notice the color in the spots were fading, however, the skin around the edges of the spots did get slightly irritated.  The cream itself has a pleasant, faint smell, it rubs in smoothly and absorbs quickly.  Overall, it is good for fading the spots, but I had to use an additional moisturizer in the same areas to keep my skin from getting irritated/flaky.	1
My review of  La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar made me feel like I had fallen down the well to NEVER NEVER LAND.  I chose this product for one reason and that reason only.  That reason was for what the package says on the front of the box.  Daily dark spot correcting moisturizer and under that it says, Dark spots, skin discolorations, dull & uneven complexion.  I am now half-way down the well for Ive turned the box over to the backside and it says, Helps prevent sunburn;  if used as directed with other sun protection measures.(see directions:  decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun.  But that is not the reason I chose PIGMENTCLAR.  I chose it for the wordage on dark spots on skin and this is not listed as the choice reason for buying this product.  I do not lie, sit, play or swim in the sun so I don't think I can give an accurate review of what it does for the user as I won't be able to use it for the uses given.  However, the product is probably great as it is part of the Loreal Group which is the largest manufacturer of beauty and health products.  And, its been around 40 years according to GOOGLE.  So it must be useful and safe . Just not for me.  And that is the only reason I gave it one star.	-1
This is a pro makeup, so it definitely applies much better with tools like a foundation brush or beauty blender. It's far more difficult to get smooth, streak free coverage by using your fingers, it's NOT a drug store line. That said, when applied properly the coverage looks really natural on me, and doesn't accentuate wrinkles and lines. I find that concealer works better via brush OVER this foundation rather than under. This foundation is more "water based" and doesn't provide any moisture at all, which is why it lasts so long. What I love most is that it lasts in hot, humid weather. When I blot (don't rub!) with a tissue my makeup stays intact under perspiration. I wear moisturiser and sunscreen underneath, that seems to help smooth application and it also looks divine with a primer. It dries quickly, so care must be taken with application.  The coverage is very buildable over areas that need a bit more "help", smoothing and feathering with my beauty blender again, merges the makeup well into areas with lighter application. I haven't gotten any oxidation (turning orange) issues yet. I love how long my blush and other makeup (brows, eye area, around lips, etc) lasts when applied on top of this foundation. This product reminds me of Revlon's Colorstay makeup except it's thicker and applies a bit more sheer than that makeup, thus looks more fresh on the skin, and doesn't make my peach fuzz show up more like Revlon's product does.  This makeup also passed the T Zone test (I have combination skin but am primarily dry and use Retin A for adult acne). I get greasy in this area and found that this makeup helps my foundation last rather than slide off of my face. My pores look good too, which is unique for a long wearing foundation that often makes them look more apparent. I love the Sepia color, for my medium complexion with a bit of warmth (I no longer tan after skin cancer showed up) that's perfect for Summer when I prefer my face to be a bit darker to match my light self tanner. I'm super pleased with this foundation! I do prep my skin prior to application (exfoliate regularly) and apply serum, moisturiser, and sunscreen or a primer for evening wear. My skin is also "mature". I've gotten a few compliments on how "healthy" my skin looks (my skin tends to be a bit blotchy naturally), so I'm definitely doing something right, LOL. 5 stars, highly recommended!	1
I was so surprised when I put this on my face!  I took just a small dab and put it on my cheek.  Oh my gosh!  When I started to blend, it just kept going!  You only need a tiny bit.  A tiny dab did my whole face and down my neck!  I was shocked at how dark it was.  After taking that small dab and blending all over my face and neck, it didn't seem so dark.  I just looked like I had a nice tan.  My face always looks lighter than the rest of my body.  So, this was great.  I don't think I would have ordered it if I had known it was this dark.  But.....after using it, I think it's perfect.  It DOES hide my eczema!  It is also a great sunscreen.  I love having it all in one product.  It is a SPF25.  I only apply once a day.  It doesn't cake in wrinkles.  Doesn't feel heavy in the heat.  Feels very smooth and silky.  I used Cafe 65N.  I have olive undertones in my skin.	1
I really do love these Thermoblend products. Great makeup. This 'camo' is easy to apply and covers all skin imperfections (i.e. I have some skin damage from the sun with age spots). I did deduct one star simply because I thought this was a little lighter than I was expecting. I ended up smoothing it out and covering it with my standard foundation so the lightness blended easily away. I do recommend Thermoblend overall because of the way my skin looks (virtually flawless) after using these products.	1
not too bad of a match to my skin. I liked how it felt light on my face and not oily at all. only concern was if you use another brand of powder to finish and you sweat it will get into your eyes and burn... but by itself it doesn't come off easily.	1
Yes, this is a woman's product, but as an 84 year old guy, I can use it occasionally on old age scars.	1
My lady friend swears by this product.  As a senior citizen, even I as an old guy can use it on my old age scars.	1
I finally found the right shade for my skin tone! I recommend using a primer with this foundation, because with me, it is a little dry otherwise. Just a tiny bit of product worked. A co-worker told me my face looked smooth and flawless-so, keeping this one on hand. It's only one ounce, but it should last a long time. Recommended.	1
Per my wife, Wow, this really provides great coverage, goes on smooth, and last all day. I have seen some reviewers complain that it sticks to your skin, but when using the Dermablend face wash, everything comes right off. I would recommend a primer underneath to get the best possible finish. Did a wonderful job covering acne and blemishes, cant recommend it enough.	1
There is a lot of pigment in this cover and a little bit (and I mean a little) goes a very long way. I have a dark spot on my face that I like to cover for special occasions and every time I use the product I think to myself that I next time I'll use less - and I've used it at least a dozen times. I usually end up patting a bunch of it off and then building back up through buffing. It does stay nice and hydrated and does not crease up. I also will dab a little into my moisturizer to even everything out a bit and that works well. There's no scent and I've had no irritations from it.	1
This stays all day!! So that is a huge plus for me, plus spf!?! Awesome! This color was a bit too dark for me tho, I would have to mix with a lighter color or get a bit more than. The bottle is also pretty small. I get that a little goes along way...but I would still prefer a bigger container.	1
I originally tried Dermablend Intense PowderCamo, and since I really liked it, I decided to try this product, Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation in Honey.  I am more used to a traditional liquid foundations like this product, and I found it easy to apply.  I especially like that it has sunscreen in it.  Its a little heavier than the products Im used to, but it also offers better coverage, blending skin tone well and camouflaging minor imperfections.  The honey shade seems ideal for medium or even darker medium skin tones.  It works all right for me during the summer when I have a tan, but once my tan fades, this honey shade will probably be too dark for my normally fair to medium skin tone.  Overall, its a good liquid foundation with sunscreen for those with medium to darker medium skin tones who have imperfections theyd like to camouflage.	1
Reviewed by my wife: I have several Dermablend products: the "CoverCreme" in several colors; the "Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation"; the "INTENSE PowderCamo". I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!  This high-coverage liquid foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It dispenses from a tube and gives a nice satiney finish. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. Truly excellent product.	1
On the daily I only wear a tinted moisturizer.  Im getting married soon and was hoping to find something with a bit more coverage to even out my skin tone, while still looking natural.  Unfortunately this is not going to be it.  First off its too dark, which is not necessarily a product flaw, but I won't really be able to wear this by itself.  Second, even if it was the right shade its way to cakey and gunky feeling/looking for my liking.  I will mix it with either my moisturizer or another lighter foundation and see if that makes any difference.  But on its own, its just not that great.	-1
I only wear a tinted moisturizer, but I have wanted something with a little more coverage, but still light.  Unfortunately this is not it.  The first time I applied it with a foundation stippling brush and it just looked awful.  I could see every pore and scar.  The second time I just used my hands and that did look better, but it was still way too cakey looking for my liking.  Ive used it for a third time and used a lot less (smaller than a pea size) and still its pretty gunky looking.  Going forward I might mix it with my tinted moisturizer and see if that will give me the coverage and feel I am looking for.  Too bad, I was really hoping this would be my miracle product.  But no such luck.	-1
What a surprise this Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo  was for me.  I thought maybe I had become immune to creams and makeup  after so many have claims that you can change from looking like an 80 year old to Taylor Swift after 1 week and you can do this for $4.95 trial and $97. automatically added to your charge each month thereafter.   I should add here that I was at one-time on a first-name basis with the manager of cosmetics at Neiman Marcus.  I've tried so many and few have impressed me.  THIS ONE DOES.  This is so blendable and covers so well.  It doesn't cake on my face.  I have tried it with a sponge,  with a professional makeup brush. and with my fingers - all worked easily.  As I was not familiar with this company, I had not looked up their history.  I have no idea how long they have been around nor anything else about them (which I have done with many companies and products) but it's the ease and look of the coverage you get with this product that makes you fall in love.  I now have six of  the products made by Dermablend and I'm next going to see if they have branched out into llipsticvk or mascara.  But even if this is all they make, I'm sticking with  them until some one comes up with the product that will make me the new 40.	1
I received this foundation in Chestnut and Copper colors. The Copper is way too dark for my complexion. The Chestnut color is darker than I thought it would be, but since I have a little tan-this works fine. This is a 1 oz. product, which may not seem like much, but it doesn't take much foundation to do the job. I prefer to use this with a primer, which really helps the color go on smoothly. I normally use light to medium coverage, so this was a little more color than I'm used to, but works well with a light hand when applying. This has 25 SPF as well.	1
Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo (medium to high coverage) foundation lives up to its claims!  This foundation provide good coverage using a dollop of product and lasts all day. The liquid is fairly "thick" but blends well. Even though the product covers well, my face does not feel "cakey" throughout the day.  I apply a squeeze of liquid foundation to my palm and use a brush to blend in the foundation.  This camo foundation goes on smoothly, covers well, and doesn't settle into "fine" lines around mouth.  Unlike the instructions in the ad, I use a brush instead of my fingers to blend the foundation because I find a brush blends better & uses less product in a single application.  The chestnut color was a touch darker than I expected (based upon the color chart), but will blend with my summertime color.  To use in the winter, I will mix with another, lighter foundation.	1
I like this make up and it does it's job pretty well, but I took off a star. I don't think it covers to the same degree they claim on the Dermablend commercials, and for how hard it is to work with spreading over my face.  It covers most acne marks, but I agree with other reviewers  it won't cover heavy duty Rosacea. This Dernablend Smooth Liquid covers over acne better than the La Posay mousse foundation I've been using, but the thicker consistency makes it harder to blend on my face. The color blends nicely to my skin tone, but it takes some work to cover my face. I have to use a foundation brush, and put a little on a time or there are some spots thicker with more make up than others.  I think this foundation will do better in the winter than the summer months I'm in now. as I write this.  It makes any sweat bead up on my face rather than allowing it to absorb and dry.	1
I had never heard of this brand and usually hesitate to try new ones - but on using it, I am really loving it.  As far this foundation is concerned, it Blends very well, it is easy to apply with hand or with brush  The texture is smooth and contains good pigmentation, leaves a light matte finish and long lasting for a full day use.	1
This is the first time Ive tried Dermablend makeup, and I was quite impressed with it.  My face has just about every variation in color you could imagine, from small colorful spider veins to blotchy freckles (not the cutely scattered across the nose kind--the big age spots run amok look) to too-red cheeks.  It was actually kind of strange to look at myself in the mirror after applying the makeup and see my face with a single base color.  Although it is a thick formulation and a little hard to put on smoothly (a sponge is really needed), nevertheless it feathers out and blends easily at the hairline and chin.  It also blended smoothly at the few stubborn dark spots where I had to apply an extra dab.  It does settle in the wrinkles just a little as the day goes on, not sure that can really be avoided with a full-coverage makeup.  All of the ones Ive tried have done that, and none of them covered as well as Dermablend.  I was also pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to wear.  I work at home and don't wear makeup every day, and often when I do it the feel of it on my face bothers me all day.  With this one, I actually forgot I had put makeup on until I went to wash up that evening and there it was.  It stayed all day, yet washed off easily.  So far, I have had no problems with it irritating my sensitive skin.  If you are looking for a full-coverage base makeup, I highly recommend you give Dermablend a try.	1
The LOreal Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  They earn being in a high-end category in my opinion. They do not seem to be scented or too chemical. The jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups. I have many favorites among them, yet I believe they all stand very well on their own.  I hope it is going to be efficient to review all of the ones I know of here, and including compatible products along the way. Respectively:  1. L'OREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF): 2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF): 3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF): 4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF): 5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO (NO SPF): 6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF): 7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25): 8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)  I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.  I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.  There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.  I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.  1. DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF): This is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.  My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have sun spots. Now I get it.  This particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  It is lovely.  If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when I apply it with dab it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.  The other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.  She has said that even in my home with shades closed I am exposing my skin to potential damage.  I score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.  The two colors I have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored LOreal Dermablend Pro products with them.  Ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.  2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF): needed. The wonderful cr&egrave;mes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the cr&egrave;me, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using them together:   Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose. A. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of cr&egrave;me I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr&egrave;me and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000 for me.  I have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself. Pick your poison, as I have purchased some powder and cr&egrave;me blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.  I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts. One thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.  3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF): These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple.  4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION!! (25 SPF): This a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the variable built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Cr&egrave;me, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.  Not only can I variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. This shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the cr&egrave;me, and the powders, I may experiment with altering the look as in 2A.  Win-Win-Win.  I also may add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.  5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF): This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  I do know that is stretching it. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!  6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY!! (NO SPF): Wow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have!  Double win!  This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which I won't feel shy about adding puffs of Dermablend Professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and I will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2A.  This is a lovely product.  I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. Love.  7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25): It is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.  8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30) This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn.  It covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000, and very smart.  Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!  The LOreal Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  They earn being in a high-end category in my opinion. They do not seem to be scented or too chemical. The jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups.

In various ways, since Amazon is not going to know my exact skin color, I have experimented, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using the various loose powder shades together:  Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose.  A. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of cr&egrave;me I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr&egrave;me and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000%! For me.  I have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally; and not necessarily all over my face and neck. U have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough, though you may find it unnecessary; you can still have a dimensional look.  I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.  One thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.  3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF): These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  The mist isn't as fine as I had expected, but it works for me.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple for me.  4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF): This a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the varying built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Cr&egrave;me, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.  Not only can I spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. I also can add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. Win-Win-Win.  5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF): This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  I do know that is stretching it though. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional Liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!  6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF): Wow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have. Double win with this product results!  This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much. I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this Quick Fix product first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, look, only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through.  This is my personal preference.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. I love it.  7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25): It is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.  It just didn't muss up and rub off.  8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30) This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn, as my dermatologist has warned about.  I have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot.  This covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000%, and very smart.  Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!	1
My daughter is really into makeup. She is excellent at doing things like wings and cut creases and all the stuff they do on those youtube tutorials. I had her use this and give me her impressions. She used the "linen" on her very light skin. She and I both have pinkish undertones, so this was slightly yellow on us, but most foundations are. The pictures are pretty true to color on the website, though I agree buying makeup online can be hard. She usually uses the lightest or next to lightest colors in the foundation lines, so the linen was pretty close on her. The coverage is about medium coverage when you put it on one lighter layer. She used both a beauty blender and a foundation brush, she liked the damp beauty blender better with this as it is very pigmented, a brush made it streaky. We both liked that you could build this foundation to get a heavier coverage. Sometimes when you try to put more on a problem area or something, the new layer just moves the underneath layer around or wipes it off. This could build. That is very nice if you want to cover a blemish, scar, or red marks or if you just like a more full-coverage look. I like lighter coverage and acutally mixed a little with some face cream and it worked that way, too.  She set hers with translucent, loose powder (I think it was kat von d brand) and it worked very well. A tinted powder may be too much pigment, but you can experiment to see what you like best.  We may try the "cream" color to give us less yellow, but this is very close. The price is very good for the heavier coverage. Will buy again.	1
The Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Medium to High Coverage Foundation Makeup with SPF 25 is  amazing. The color way matches my skin tone perfectly. The coverage is professional looking. It's an added bonus that it helps prevent my skin from the harmful rays of the sun.  I can apply in the morning and the makeup last all day long.  My skin is oily and I often get undesirable blemishes and most make up has the tendency to make this worse but not this one. The coverage from this blend hides all imperfections and masks redness as well. It really good for dark eyes circles too.  This foundation is oil-free so it doesn't add to my skins oil. While blended in it doesn't make my skin feel heavy. A little bit of this goes a long way. You can apply with with your fingers but I recommend a makeup sponge. I felt that when applying it with my fingers that I used more of the product than needed. So a makeup sponge will extend the time needed before having to purchase again.  I like this makeup is fragrance-free, allergy-tested, sensitive skin tested, non-comedogenic. My skin had no irritation at all when wearing this.  The make up comes in a tube that features a twist top lid and a clear window so you can see what color it is from the outside. The hole the foundation flows from is fine in size to ensure you don't use more foundation than you need. If thrown into a makeup bag or into luggage I wouldn't worry about it coming open and getting on everything.  I highly recommend giving it a try! I'm very pleased.	1
Another winning product from Dermablend. High quality ingredients, easy to apply and long lasting.	1
Dermablend has quickly became my favorite brand!  Pros: - Coverage is excellent - wide range of shades - full coverage without a caked on look - long lasting, all day wear - no fragrance  Cons - cost	1
This foundation is full coverage.  It goes on fairly easy and is buildable.  It does good job of making my skin tone look even and covering some light sunspots and redness from blemishes.  This is heavier than I'm use to and I could feel it on my face. My skin is somewhat dry and I feel by the ended of the day it settled into creases and fine lines so I will definitely moisturize well before I apply this next time. If your skin is dry and it settles into the creases and fine lines it can age you and I don't want that. Overall it did a good job covering and evening out my skin so I am pleased with that but do to it being so heavy this won't be my everyday foundation but more of something I wear on special occasions.  It mostly stayed on when I rinsed it with water and removed well when I used my face cleanser.	1
As a super pale woman, I have a myriad of light colored foundations. Most are too yellow or too pink or turn orange on my skin after a couple of hours (even with primer). The best selection I've found so far or pale skin is Kat Von D, but that foundation is heavy coverage that looks a bit too much for my daytime look. I decided to try Dermablend Liquid Camo in Linen. It is an almost perfect foundation for someone as pale as me. It is almost exactly my skin tone, just a wee bit darker than Iike. Still, it is closer than most any other foundations on the market. It's fine for every day, especially when I put a lighter powder dusting. When dressing up, I'll mix a bit of the Kat Von D with it and it's perfect. It doesn't get cakey with my oily skin and lasts all day. It's buildable so you can get a heavier coverage when you want. It goes on very smoothly and doesn't feel heavy or greasy on my skin.  I absolutely love it and will be getting more when this tube runs out.	1
I've always had discoloration that had been almost impossible for me to cover up completely, and this foundation had changed my life! Definitely my go to foundation.	1
I've tried a number of Dermablend products, and have been disappointed. They aren't full coverage and nothing out of the ordinary. They are exactly the same as any of the heavier foundations on the market.  I tested this particular product on a bruise. I applied several layers and you could still see it.  Not impressed.	-1
I was so pleasantly surprised by this Dermablend Camo foundation. The color match was great, the coverage was amazing and the sunscreen was a huge bonus. I loved the flawless finish that this foundation gave me without feeling heavy. It lasts for hours and needs minimal concealer for any scars. I also have combination skin and have had no issues with acne with this foundation.	1
The grand daughter approves.  She says she loves the look it gives.  She applies and then uses setting powder to finish a look that lasts her all day at college.  She says it's built in moisturizer keeps her face fresh and looking good all day long.  She loves it!  She said give it five stars.  She uses the Medium To High and it was what she expected in tone and highlights.  So five stars it is.  She said young women would welcome the all day factor.	1
Love this liquid foundation.  Excellent coverage.  Days quickly ... waterproof .... washes away with soak and water. The color Cameo near perfect match to my skin color. Contains a nice high sun  block.  I normally use a primer but did not in my first testing in the garden !!!  Can and do highly recommend Dermablend liquid foundation.	1
Love this foundation! I normally need light ivory, ivory or porcelain color foundations and this matches me pretty well. My skin has pink undertones and this is a little bit more yellow than I am but still works. It is lightweight and provides excellent coeverage without being cakie. You can build on the coverage by adding a layer like coverup. Dermablend is a great brand!	1
Great foundation that fits my skin tone, making a super long lasting make up. Surprisingly, no touch ups are needed as when using other foundation brands. I did my make up at 3pm to go to work and it's 9pm and still looking perfect.  Provides a  smooth look, it's not oily and it's waterproof. I know this because I tried washing my hands the first time I got it, and put some product to test the tone to my skin and water won't remove your foundation. To do so, cleanse with soap.  This product is amazing. Great coverage and your skin will definitely look different.	1
Dermablend Professional Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation Titanium Dioxide Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 25 Natural is by far most popular medium beige, but it has an interesting application for concealing & neutralizing makeup not by hiding blemishes and discoloration in order to achieve an almost perfectly uniform appearance, which is extremely rare and thus uncommon, but by greatly reducing their intensity to make them appearing like a natural only slight variation of color typical to the rest and vast majority of us additionally intensifying with aging.  It is especially useful to cover darker or more reddish blemishes and discoloration, so the resulting hue, which is a product of making natural slightly darker, becomes a typical natural variant.  In other words, of 2 methods: (1) to choose a color matching the complexion to cover entirely the discolorations, or (2) to choose the natural color and to cover the discolorations with a thinner layer showing slightly trough, the second is much cheaper, as using much less creme, and does not produce artificial, mask-like effect, but requires more artist-like skills and also use of Setting Powder on the top to finish and protect the result.	1
This foundation provides the perfect amount of coverage.  It doesn't sit heavy on my face, and it blends well.  Before applying, I use a concealer to cover up the redness in my cheeks.  Then, I apply the foundation, followed by the Dermablend finishing powder.  This evens out any oil in the foundation, and sets it so that it is less likely to wear or rub off.  The Dermablend finishing powder is my favorite!  I use a makeup sponge to apply my foundation, and this works well with it.  This foundation is thinner then my usual foundation, however, it is thick.  It covers my face really well.  I would consider it more of a high coverage foundation.  It doesn't get cakey, and it blends well.  I really like this foundation.  It isn't too greasy and it dries quickly.  This color is a bit dark for my fair to medium complexion.  I find the way that the colors are listed on Amazon, a bit confusing as to which color is the lightest to darkest.  If you visit other makeup sites, they list them in order.  If you are looking for a fantastic foundation, then give this one a try!	1
That is one of the best things about this product, I had no irritation. I usually start tingling and itching as soon as I put foundation on my face and I always have to wash it off. It also never lasts long. The color was great but I did apply it over a lighter color. I did apply three different colors of the same brand and I thought this helped. I would need a bit lighter, I think. I like that it has a sunscreen in it. I only applied it once this afternoon. I was just trying to see if that I could keep it on my skin. I will attempt to wear it for a longer period. I did attempt to wash it off in the shower with soap and I do not think all of it was removed. I just need to find the right shade for me. I received this for my honest opinion and was not compensated.	1
this has a really orange tinge to it. so not something I would use alot for me. But a very little will cover up anything you like. I did like that part. Easy to cover my scar i have on my face. Does not come off with just water. You have to use soap too. which again is nice if your are gonna swim or anything.  Over all works great just not the right shade for me	1
This is the fourth product I've tried by this brand & I have to say, that I've found the entire line a huge disappointment.  I think it's four products too many & won't be bothering to try any of their other products as I'm fairly confident I won't like any of them either.  This product is slightly better than some of their others but not by much.  Not only is it obvious you have makeup on, it also feels unpleasant.  It has a greasy almost waterproof feeling to it.  Like their other products this seems to accentuate rather than hide acne scars.  It covers up minor skin pigmentation issues, but the price is an obvious mask of makeup.	-1
I really like this foundation.  I was really impressed with the coverage when using a small amount-  it looked almost full coverage to me.  The color match is very good for now (it will get a bit light over the summer as I get darker).  I got Sepia and I am light medium with a warmer complexion.  I tried this without any primer to test wear-time.  I used my usual skincare, including my Paula's Choice sunscreen underneath.  I topped it with my Too Faced Primed and Poreless loose powder to set and then when I finished my makeup I used my Urban Decay setting spray (I always use this, can't help it)!  I think it lasted nicely and wore down well throughout the day.  I did not put quite as much setting powder as they recommend.  I actually don't like the feeling of a lot of powder.	1
I am very impressed with the Dermablend products. The medium coverage is great for me. it is liquid and easy to apply. it also has an spf of 25, which is a necessity for me. This formula also hydrates and lasts for 16 hours (make sure you use the setting powder for that 16 hours of smooth, non-cakey look that evens out your skin tone and hides imperfections.	1
I hardly ever use liquid foundation, I don't really like the way they feel on my skin. When amazon vine offered it to me, I thought why not, may be this time I'll like it. I do love this foundation by Dermablend. This past weekend I had a dance performance in an auditorium and needed professional makeup. My makeup artist used my foundation and results were awesome, my skin looked flawless. Makeup stayed the whole time even when I was sweating backstage after the performance. I'll definitely recommend the product and the brand.	1
Excellent foundation that lasts all day.  No break outs or skin irritation.  The medium color was perfect for my skin tone.  Blends easily and a little goes a long way!	1
This makeup foundation really stays put.  It doesn't look heavy when applied. It seems almost too sheer to cover flaws unless you layer it. When you start to remove it though, it doesn't come off with just washing with water. You need a makeup remover.  "Honey" is probably for someone with a good tan or a little darker skin.  The "Honey Beige" works well for me. I usually wear "beige"  and this works fine for me.  Layering it over flaws makes the flaws less visible without caking or making everything look overdone.	1
Dermablend's Smooth Liquid Camo Medium To High Coverage Foundation Makeup is great for sunscreen protection which lasts all day. You may need to set it with Dermablend's powder after you apply it. Dermablend is as reliable as it has always been for masking scars, tattoos or littler things that only bother you when you want to look your best. Having it in liquid foundation form is very nice--you can go to the beach wearing this as a sunscreen and look maaaarvlous, darling!  :)	1
It goes on so easily and spreads easily. If you don't have time, this seems to be the way to go. It does cover up non-dark tattoos for those interested.  I don't notice any irritation. Glad for the sunscreen due to titanium dioxide, the key ingredient to protect against UV rays. Color works for me. And it lasts many hours.	1
Forget my Urban Decay liquid makeup, Dermablend is where it's at! The last month or so I've been using two kinds of Dermablend liquid makeup. This one, and their Blurring Mousse Camo which is a medium coverage, lighter than this. I'm telling you this in case you are trying to decide what Dermablend liquid makeup is best for you. This can be applied with your fingers or a sponge (I like the sponge with this for an even coverage). At 43, I have uneven skin tone, blotchiness, and larger pours. Sometimes I have darker areas under the eyes and depending on how much sun I get my dark spots get even darker. Another words I need an even palette! This product for me is best when I find my face is REALLY extra discolored from the sun. The Camo medium coverage does a great coverage for normal daily use. Both cover nicely. This product can be used with or without a primer. I like it with. The other Camo medium coverage does NOT need primer...which I love! This is slightly thicker and does a better coverage job, but because it's slightly thicker I don't feel it covers my pores as easy as when I use a primer. I'm not saying anything negative by any means, because I love it! There is not much scent, and I've had no issues with breakouts, rashes or any irritation. This is all day, long lasting coverage!	1
This is so much smaller than I expected at 1oz per tube. I was overwhelmed at the color choices Dermablend offers. I would recommend buying this in person first before buying online. Before using, I watch a video that shows how Dermablend recommends applying it. I used my hands like in the video, blended it with a brush, then set it with a powder. It worked beautifully and I was so happy with how it looked once I was done. What I liked most about it is how hydrated my face looks after applying. It leaves a satin finish that looks much more natural compared to the MAC I typically wear which leaves a matte. I found the pigment to cover very well and my skin is an even tone after applying. Under my eyes i added an additional corrector. I am a Dermablend believer, and I will be switching to this once I use up all my MAC. I hate the feeling of lots of makeup on my face, so I tend to go lighter and therefore not look as finished. This has the best of both worlds and has me loving makeup. It goes on light, but gives a generous amount of coverage.	1
I have hyper pigmentation and this foundation covered it quite well while not being overly heavy. You have to go online and find your shade, and heyavyou see in the company's website is pretty similar to the actual color. This foundation has a cool based hue that is flattering and not ashy not too light. I have fair to medioum olive skin and this color was perfect for me. I put it in the morning and it lasted throughout my workday which was good, but you should reapply for better coverage over extended periods of time.  The foundation feels great, its blendable, breathable, and buildable. You can adjust coverage by applying a bit more for more coverage.	1
Dermablend is considered a prestige beauty brand (as you can tell by the price) and you can find at your favorite beauty store. I thought the foundation went on very smoothly, very creamy and set up nicely with my setting powder.  This is considered medium/to full coverage and is very buildable.	1
This Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Medium to High Coverage Foundation Makeup with SPF 25 covers my skin discolorations and a facial scar  as well as various other skin challenges.  First off, you really need to go to a store in person to find the right color for your skin. Dermablend makes a wide range of shades and the color must be spot on to get flawless, undetectable coverage. After you find the right color, you can order it online forever but the right color is crucial. There are many stores that carry the Dermablend line.  I've been using Dermablend's Camo Powder Foundation for 3 years now because it covers very well and is quick and easy to apply. This liquid version takes a little more time to apply and blend but I think the end result is a little smoother and more even. I am using a makeup sponge and I apply a fairly light layer and get a medium coverage.  I have skin discolorations from melasma as a result of having 7 kids and dark, under eye circles and a facial scar. This provides good coverage with a light layer. I can get complete coverage with a few layers but I hate wearing heavy foundation. I use a setting powder and it lasts the entire day. DON'T skip the setting powder because it's what keeps the makeup from rubbing off or settling into lines and creases. (Dermablend makes a good setting powder but really, you can use any loose powder for this purpose.)  I will still use the Camo Powder Foundation for daily use because it's just so fast and convenient but for times when I want to look especially good, this will be my go-to foundation.	1
It is nice to have a trusted make-up company like LOreal that continues to produce wonderful products that wear great and are made to a higher standard. This make up has a medium feel and coverage. A very small amount goes a long way and covers a lot of area. It is not so thick that all you see is the make-up. It has good coverage, but is still transparent enough to see the texture of your skin. Most all quality make-ups these days have UV protection and this one is no different in that respect. This has moderate protection at an SPF of 25. It must be reapplied every 2 hours to maintain that protection if you are sun exposed. This is a nice make-up at a reasonable price.	1
Dermablend has a great product lineup with some great camouflage blends. From heavy to lighter coverage they all feature some amount of SPF protection. I really like the quality and feel of it. It leaves skin feeling smooth and is not greasy nor sticky. The texture is silky which is a nice surprise. The coverage is excellent and a little goes a long way. Even applied to hands and neck this works well on most areas. It has good water and sweat resistance and stays on well. A quick scrub with a good skin cleanser and water washes it off. You do have to put some effort into it. Great foundation and camo. Professional strength is right.	1
The only reason I listed this as darker than expected is that I feel the picture doesn't really show how dark this shade is. I attached a picture below so you can see that the tone of it is very dark.  This liquid camo is the real deal.  It has full coverage and is waterproof, i.e. it won't come off until you was it off.  It's a great cover up  if you want full coverage. Highly recommend.	1
My wife likes the rosy/pink shade this delivers. You can use it with any loose powder. It has no fragrance. It hides imperfections. If you're not sure which shade to get, try/buy it at a department store that sells it. Or rely on Amazon's return policy.	1
I am new to Dermablend products but this one is by far my favorite as it applies smoothly and doesn't settle into fine lines but masks any imperfections and redness. I applied it  with a sponge and it stayed put through the Texas heat and made my skin look even and I like the lightweight texture and the fact that is has sun protection of SPF 25. I also love the upside down squeeze tube design and I would buy this once my bottle runs out.	1
This medium coverage foundation is way too dark for my complexion. I expected the warm beige to be like a tan, instead this foundation is more for women of color or those that have a deep olive or super deep tan. It has SPF 25 sunscreen protection.  In addition to the color issue, I found that it does go on smoothly. Every time I applied a little bit, I had blotches of color on my face and trying to blend it was practically impossible.	-1
This is so much smaller than I expected at 1oz per tube. I was overwhelmed at the color choices Dermablend offers. I would recommend buying this in person first before buying online. Before using, I watch a video that shows how Dermablend recommends applying it. I used my hands like in the video, blended it with a brush, then set it with a powder.

It goes on light, but gives a generous amount of coverage.	1
This is an excellent foundation, and I love how it includes a strong SPF for summer use. It lasts all day and provides complete coverage and a beautiful canvas on which to apply other makeup.  It blends very well, and I think it is the perfect texture. It does not smell like sunscreen (or really anything else, either).  The tube is smaller than I was expecting (although I received a full-size product), so it's expensive. Great product, though.	1
Product is good, goes on easily. I don't think the colors on the website reflect the actual colors of the makeup that well. Camel seems like it should be a good match for Indian skin but the undertone is more yellow, so it makes you look ill. Four stars.	1
Liquid foundation application is very smooth. Only a small amount is needed as I applied too much the first time I used it and had to wipe some off. I like the sunscreen protection which is so important today.	1
Love this! It goes on smoothly and is very light feeling. It didn't get oily or heavy during the day, in fact I forgot I even had it on. I will say that the color is a little light for my skin tone, but I think it's because I've been out in the sun. I have a feeling that once summer is over, this shade will be perfect.	1
Ok I tried the cinnamon one, it was a little too dark for my skin... my mother is a little darker than I am and it was almost too light for her... it kind of made her look ashy. For both of us, with a little extra blending, the product could work. It's of great quality and let me tell you it does not take a lot... which means this will last a long time.  It's also hard to get off...which is good and bad. It doesn't rub off on clothes but I had to scrub to get it off.  All in all, great product, not drying or caking.	1
Dermablend gives an airbrushed effect without using very much.  The colors are also forgiving.  I used bisque which seems like it would be too dark for my complexion but it still worked color wise.  Is lightweight which helps add to a natural look and a little goes a long way.  It has no scent and it stays put for quite awhile even in hot weather.  It's almost not there because it blends so well and looks so natural.	1
I am a picky foundation person- I have traditionally purchased La Mer and Channel... Spending over $100 for the best products that is moisturizing with great coverage and where it doesn't cause me horrible pimple or rash breakouts. I am also out on a stage or giving a presentation and look for products that withstand heavy lights and where I do not look drowned out... I LOVE this product. It has great coverage and I did not have a hug breakout at all where I frequently experience this with other products. Best of all- I save money.	1
When I read that this smooth liquid foundation helps cover problem areas such as Rosacea, which gives me a red nose, I was excited to try it. The squeeze container helps the foundation to distribute easily, but there is still the potential to over-squeeze. The foundation applies easily and blends well. I'm impressed as it seems to do the job, which is to hide my reddish nose. That said, my associated white spots could still use some extra shading.  Dermablend suggests setting the foundation station with their powder, which might help any transference to things like my phone, but I haven't had any other issues with the foundation coming off or smearing, even when sweating. I spent the day outside, very hot with decent cloud coverage, but I didn't notice any darkening in skin tone the next day, so I'd say the SPF works well. All in all, I was impressed by this. Recommended.	1
Nice smooth makeup. Goes on easily and blends well. No strong scent or anything that irritated my sensitive skin. Very nice product	1

Goes on easily and does a good job of covering blemishes. Lasts all day.	1
This is the first time I used Dermablend liquid makeup.  I ordered product online and I was not sure about the shade of the product.  Shade is not too dark and it is much better alternative to put some color to the face than tanning.  This product requires a very little application and it is easy to spread out.  I put it over my daily moisturizer.  It has double duty: it provides SPF 25 skin protection form the sun and provides skin a beautiful tan coverage.  This product is not marketed as foundation but rather as a "smooth liquid camo" product.  It covers skin imperfections such as discolorations, blemishes and rosacea flare ups.  I am a licensed esthetician and for some clients I like to apply this product on their face (if they are not too pale).  That way if they have to go about their day they get nice even coverage and sun protection.  This product has active ingredient titanium dioxide (sunscreen) 6.8%.  It appears that Dermablend is a skin care line created by Loreal.  This product comes in 1.0 oz size and it can be easily squeezed out of plastic bottle.	1
The color was 'way too dark for my face - but it looked good on my granddaughter (26)'s tanned face.  I was hoping for something that would take care of my brown spots and uneven skin tones, but I'm going to need a much lighter shade - and that's the tough part of ordering without testing it first.  The dark tones are very dark - so my next order will be for one that's very light!	1
This goes on quickly and smoothly for a nice matte finish. To get it to blend in apply a nice dusting of face powder. This does anice job on uneven skin.	1
This makeup covers well and goes on smoothly. The only negative, to me, is that you need  powder to look matte.  It isn't as natural looking as my favorite brand, La Roche-Posay Effaclar BB Blur Instant Oil-Absorbing Coverage BB Cream. It does cover better though. Depending on what you need to cover, this makeup works great. I will use it more in the winter than summer.	1
I have tried so many liquid foundations. Both high end and drugstore. I am always on the prowl for full coverage, transfer resistant, long lasting foundations. I probably have 20 liquid foundations right now. If it says "full coverage" and "long lasting"--I've probably tried it.  This foundation is full coverage. It's not camouflage foundation, but it has good coverage that is buildable. I've had trouble getting it to last longer than a few hours. I have combination, acne-prone skin. I tried it alone, with NYX Matte Finish setting spray, and with Urban Decay DeSlick setting spray. The sprays helped, but inevitably my face would get oily and the foundation swiped off. For this reason, I would say it's neither transfer resistant nor long lasting.  If you have dry skin, I think this would work great for you. It has high pigmentation, so you don't have to use tons of product to get even coverage. It has a beautiful natural finish that's neither dewy or matte.  Although I couldn't get it to last very long, I will keep this. I'll use it as a makeshift *full coverage* tinted moisturizer, when my face gets dry after exfoliating. It reminds me of the Cargo Tinted Moisturizer.	1
This foundation is lighter than the Dermablend Mousse and takes more to get full coverage.  It also leaves my face feeling more oily than the mousse but not enough to create a shine or make my glasses slide off.  The coverage is smooth with no lines or streaks.  The directions on the bottle are for sunscreen and not for applying makeup but the description on the amazon page gives good instruction for the novice.  I applied a light powder over the top and have received several comments that I look really nice today, in spite of wearing a t-shirt and jeans.  This foundation did a pretty good job covering the blotches and red spots I have from rosacea.	1
I normally don't use foundation, but I decided to give this a try. It went on smoothly and did not feel like I was applying a heavy or gooey spackle to my face. It was actually what I would describe as light. It was fairly even and consistent. I had a slight problem with a little streaking and I remedied it by applying a little more. I finished this all with brush applied face powder. My freckles were gone which would recommend this for frequent use. Very nice product which left me looking a little tawny and fresh looking.	1
This foundation was much thicker and heavier than I expected. I'm typically fair skinned, but right now my face is tanned. When I put this on it was much too light, and looked like I was wearing a mask. I did find that this foundation gave me full coverage, but it was a bit too much for me. I didn't need to apply much to my face to fully cover it, a little bit goes a long way with this liquid foundation. After putting it on, I felt that it dried up a bit and didn't look as smooth. If you're looking for a full coverage foundation, this is it.	-1
When it says smooth it definitely means it. The coverage is great, a small amount covers a large area. I have worn it for an entire day, and I don't think it stays on the entire time but I think it's still a good product. I got the color medium and at first it looked a little dark for my skin.  But over the summer I tanned a little bit but now its perfect.  I think the value is good, a little goes a long way.	1
This went on smoothly, it blends in easily, and had no scent.  She was very satisfied with how well it covered age spots, and that it has sunscreen in it as well.  It seemed to last without needing reapplications frequently.  My downside for it is that it's pricey - over seven hundred bucks a pound.  Some of the other things she has used covered as well, but were more fiscally viable in the long run.	1
This is a very high quality makeup but be sure you understand what it is...a FULL coverage makeup. I was in a car accident when I was young and have scars. It does as good a job as anything I have tried for covering the scars. But for every day wear for the average person it may be too heavy. Know what you are looking for and if you need full coverage, this is the best	1
Dermablend has been good to me!! I have used the body concealer lotion for a few years now. It has done wonders for my legs (with all of their imperfections), and now this lighter-weight foundation for my face is perfect.	1
Yes, yes, yes! Love how well this product covers imperfections. Only a very small amount is needed to cover the entire face. Best foundation out there! This color was too dark for me, but I did get the correct one and it is my all-time favorite!	1
As with many make-up products, I have a hard time finding the right color for my skin tone. That being said, this camo goes on easily and its almost as if it disappears into your skin while it covers. Upon drying, which doesn't take long at all, it doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky or oily. In addition it has a SPF of 25, which is higher than your average foundation having sunscreen. As soon as I find the right color, I'll be in make-up Heaven.	1
This is one of this best foundations I have ever used. It is considered a medium coverage foundation but can be built up for full coverage or applied with a damp sponge for more sheer coverage. A little goes a long way - you'll less than you think for average coverage. The sepia tone is a neutral with a slight yellow undertone. When set with a powder the finish is flawless and lasts for hours. It covers any imperfections without a heavy caked on look. I have combination skin and this works well for me. It seems like it would for most any skin type. I like the versatility of this foundation since I can control coverage depending on my needs. The Dermablend Powder Camo foundation is nice but is not able to provide the fuller coverage that this liquid does (nice for light or medium coverage though). A great product that delivers as promised....	1
I used to sell and use this product years ago. I am glad to see they changed the formulation for the better, IMHO. I like the creamy feel of the foundation that does not weigh as heavy as the old formula. I would normally have chosen a dark color with a red undertone, but this one seems to work very well with my skin color. The coverage is nice and smooth. However, time will tell how well it will hold up under the high heat of summer in the Middle East..	1
I'm genuinely impressed with this product. I usually use Mary Kay medium coverage Ivory 1 because it dries on without feeling heavy. I primarily use foundation under my eyes because of dark circles. This Dermablend foundation is almost exactly like the Mary Kay stuff. It spreads easy but the coverage is still pretty large. It's more on the thin side but again it's able to cover a large portion with a tiny amount. I really like that there is sunscreen on it too. It dries without feeling heavy and blends well. It is slightly more expensive than my Mary Kay foundation but it's definitely a product I would buy again.	1
Dermablend makes different strength products to meet specific skin camouflage issues. Some conceal almost anything and some are lighter formulations made to cover less pigmented skin issues. This is a medium coverage foundation with broad spectrum SPF 25 protection. It works best on red and light brown discolorations but its not designed to conceal darker marks.  It successfully concealed a small red mark and a couple light brown age spots. After application it dries quickly. I rubbed at the covered spots quite vigorously to see if I could remove the foundation but the make-up was unaffected and the spots remained concealed.  The consistency is smooth but thick. I used a sponge to apply and the liquid went on evenly. Make-up wipes worked well to remove the foundation. A little goes a long way, so squeeze the tube gently to avoid wasting product.  This is a heavier consistency than what I usually wear and I have noticed that when make-up contains Titanium dioxide (used for sun protection) it seems to negatively affect the texture so it is a surprise it blends so well. No fragrance or sticky feeling and there is no shineon the skin it has a matte appearance.  The Chai color is a medium beige with yellow undertones. It is just a shade darker than my skin tone but after application looked quite natural. The product is effective at what it is designed to do. Finding the correct color is the trick although they do blend well if skin tone falls between two shades. Excellent.	1
I don't like the lid. It does come on and off easy, and it does stand upright, but it tends to be messy when closing and opening. This was much lighter than it appears during application. You only need a wee bit to spread and it goes on like paint. It's thick and you have to spread evenly. It literally applied to the face like paint to a wall. Do I like it, yes! I just have to be careful not to use too much. I am fair/light skinned and this gives a brighter look.	1
Does not blend well and stay on. After an hour or two, it creases and needs to re applied.	-1
I am always looking for an effective sunscreen that does double duty as a blemish cover-up.  Im impressed with the effectiveness of this Dermablend Blurring Mousse.  Its not too thick or clumpy and in my case does an excellent job of covering the age spots that have popped up without permission just under my hairline.  I like that there are shades that you can choose and its not a one-size-fits-all like so many other sunscreen products.  You can choose a tone that is suitable for both daytime and nighttime wear.  The price point is a little higher than I usually choose but Ive found a little goes a long way  you certainly don't slather it on.  In fact its basically a high end make up item.  Its very natural looking; not cackey or maskey.	1
This is a really nice foundation. You only need about a pea size amount to cover your whole face (the first few times I used it, I squirted out more and wasted it). It is not a moisturizing foundation, so if you have dry skin, make sure you moisturize first. Overall, I was impressed with the coverage. To pick a shade online seems hard as the swatches of color provided are small and hard to compare to your skin tone.	1
This is really good for hiding bruises or other marks. Riding and working with horses daily leaves me random bruises all the time - especially on my legs. This is a problem if I need/want to wear a skirt or dress. I have to decide between pantyhose or attempting to cover the bruise or just wearing pants.  This camo medium coverage actually did a good job covering a fresh bruise on my thigh. I bumped into a rock trying to clear a trail by the creek this morning. The resulting scratch and dark area is seriously ugly. One thin layer covered and hid 90% of the discoloration. Unfortunately, the copper color is a tad too dark for my skin tone, but I am perfectly willing to find the correct shade for future use.	1
I've always had trouble with standard foundations finding my perfect shade of brown. Especially during the summer when i tan, i was really skeptical trying Dermablend, but i figured why not. The Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation is the Perfect cover. Even without primer or touch up sticks, this will leave your skin looking smooth and flawless.  It's quite thick however feels light on your skin and you don't need much to achieve your perfect look. Overall for all of us brown skin girls, this is the color and cover we've been searching for.  I would definitely give it a try, it's worth the extra $$ for the quality.	1
Once you try any formula of Dermablend, you will never want to be without it. I am a woman of a certain age, and I have purchased just about every brand of cosmetics from dollar store to high-end cosmetics counter. Absolutely everything I have tried from Dermablend positively blows every other brand out of the water. There is simply nothing that compares to this line. It is easy to apply, and as you work it in you can see imperfections seem to melt away. Do not be deterred by the price, because in the end you will save lots of money. It is highly concentrated -- great color density with a light application. Of course, you can repeat the application in particularly troublesome areas, but the improvement is awesome. I am overwhelmed by the quality, and I am now a customer for life.	1
I gave this a try before I gave it to my wife. I tried it on the back of my hand where a variety of marks are visible. It went on very smoothly and, best of all, had no odor. It did not completely hide the marks but when I showed the results to my wife she said she would use this because she felt the results were good.	1
I love this creamy foundation, a little dab will go a long way.  It covers my freckles, age spot, and large pores easily.  Don't apply this too heavily as it will look cakelike and settle into wrinkles.  I found I needed to check my face from time to time to lightly smooth out the foundation that settled into lines.  It is water resistant as I first applied it to my hand and went to wash it off and I had to scrub it a little for it to wash away. Highly recommend!	1
Dermablend IS Blendable & Buildable  I'm multi-racial and I do get a little sun each day. Freckles and hyperpigmentation are an issue. The best shade and corrective tools are not easily selected from the array of available ones. Mixing a custom shade is an option for my base coloration too. IF you have the opportunity to visit  Dermablend ARTISTS go there and let them show you the HOW-TOs of looking splendid 'flaws and all" at your best.  It's great to see Dermablend is available on Amazon.	1
I tried Dermablend some years ago and didn't like it because it looked really cakey and thick. Things have changed! This foundation goes on smoothly, doesn't cake around fine lines and wrinkles, and smooths out skin tone very nicely.  You can apply this foundation with a sponge or with your fingertips (as I do) and it goes on smoothly. after waiting a few minutes, it's a good thing to set this foundation with a light brush of powder. The coverage is very good and this foundation stays in place for about 8 hours before it needs touching up. It looks quite natural in daylight and office lighting, I think.  I have very sensitive skin and this product did not cause breakouts or irritation--it's a very clean foundation with no oils to clog pores.  One thing: the color runs a bit darker than expected, so I would recommend purchasing a shade lighter than you might ordinarily buy.  All in all, I'm very happy with this product.	1
I was really impressed with the coverage this offers. I do think it really helps with the lasting power if you set this, but you don't need the dermablend powder to do that. I use coty airspun and it works just fine. This covers my hyperpigmentation, whatever pimples I might happen to have, and a dark melasma spot. I don't even really need concealer!	1
This foundation is a good match for my skin tone - I am MAC NC40 It is full coverage but not as thick as the version that comes in the tub. I like to sheer it out by applying with a damp  beauty blender and adding a drop of Farsali rose gold elixir With setting powder it stays put for at least 8 hours on my very oily skin A tiny amount goes a long way Doesn't oxidize or turn orange No flash back with photography	1
This is a very nice liquid medium-coverage foundation.  I was randomly assigned a color (sepia) and unfortunately it was too light and cool for my skin tone (I normally wear IT CC+ in Medium).  However, I did apply a full face of this foundation and wear it around the house during one of my days off.  Application is smooth and seamless.  It comes out of the tube in a nice controlled cream, so you can very easily choose more or less of the product.  For a whole face I needed about one to two pea sized amounts, using a foundation brush.  I think if you used a beauty blender you might need a bit more.  Blending was creamy and it worked well into my concealer - I am a foundation first, concealer second kind of girl and I found that the Dermablend was very easy to integrate.  Longevity was good.  Once I finished my makeup I applied a powder (Ambient Lighting Palette) to finish and set it, and over that a misting of setting spray.  I found it to wear very well for the next 8 or so hours, throughout an entire day of chores, some light gardening and cleaning.  I did not apply another sunscreen to my face and I got no sun exposure redness at the end of the day, so it definitely holds up to its sunscreen claims.  Perhaps related to this is that the Dermablend is not "dewy" the way some of the other cream foundations are - it is way more matte.  I'd say over all that this is a very solid product.  It covers well - even in the slightly wrong tone it glided over redness and smoothed my skin out very nicely.  It holds up to normal wear and tear and presents an attractive fairly matte finish.	1
I love this creamy foundation that covers my freckles, age spots and large, ugly pores.  Use just a teeny, tiny amount of water to blend, but don't apply too heavy as it will look cake-like and show EVERY wrinkle.  It lasts all day but check in the mirror from time to time as it settles in the lines and needs smoothing out. Overall, I highly recommend!	1
Reviewed by my wife: I have several Dermablend products: the "CoverCreme" in several colors; the "Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation"; the "INTENSE PowderCamo". I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!  This high-coverage liquid foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It dispenses from a tube and gives a nice satiney finish. I tested "Honey Beige" on the back of my hand (see image attached - the lightest color below my middle finger on the back of the hand). It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. Truly excellent product.	1
I think finding the right shade of concealer or foundation online is hard.  I am not sure this is the right shade for me or my daughter, but going to give it a try.  I love the thickness of this foundation, it will definitely do the the trick to cover up blemishes or under eye circles.  If you don't like high coverage foundation, this is not for you.  If you need a highly pigmented, high coverage foundation, I recommend you try this one.  I am very happy with it, but I might need to try another shade.  I think this foundation might be enough to cover blemishes/dark circles, and might not even need concealer.  I like eliminating steps in my make up routine.	1
The last time I bought from Dermablend was about 20 years ago.  Back then they were known as the makeup that would cover ANYTHING.  I had a deep scar on my face from a dog attack and the dermablend would totally cover it.  As time and surgery went on, the scar is not at all noticeable now, so I don't need the heavy duty spackle of yesteryear, but I was interested in this new (to me) lighter foundation.  The product goes on easily and is not at all thick and greasy.  Coverage is super, pores disappear.  30 SPF sunblock.  Sleek looking tube and package.  It lasts all day, you don't need the powder unless you are going to sweat this off or have really oily skin.  The ONLY problem I have is finding the right color.  I wish the company would have one place at Amazon where you could see all the shades, not just the four in your tone range.  I thought I was in the lighter tone family, but after using the bisque, I could actually go two or three tones darker and with more pink, less yellow.  I know the full range of colors are offered, it is just super hard for ME to match them up.  The other thing, the names make zero sense to me.  I mean what is bisque?  Is that like a lobster soup?  What is Sienna?  Camel?  Chai?  I think numbers would be better, maybe ranging from Yellow 1 to Pink 1 to Cocoa 1 or some naming scheme where we all have the same definitions of the product.	1
I really like this product, it goes on smoothly and looks very nice.  I have a pretty tan complexion but this was still a bit to dark for me.  I am still using it by using less and mixing it with a bit of moisturizer to lessen the darkness and it also makes the application easier and smoother.  This makeup does last all day, it is very good.	1
I love Dermablend productsyou get great coverage.  It goes on smoothly and stays with you all day.  I have tried many of their products and I have not had any breakouts or irritations.  You can build your foundation with this makeupso if you have a problem area, simply apply small amounts until you become happy with the area.  I think you will be satisfied with their product and they offer several shades to meet your needs.  I always set this foundation with the loose translucent setting powderit gives  you a very finished look which I just love.	1
The chai color is between light shades and medium shades.  It is warm with what I'd call yellowish tones. It goes on easy enough.  It is heavier coverage than any foundation makeup I've worn.  This covers light freckles, red spots well.  It does not cover very dark or black spots.  It covers scars as far as color goes, but doesn't do anything for the uneven surface that they leave.  It settles into lines, fine and deeper a lot, so it can age the skin.  It's comfortable for a couple of hours but then it begins to make my skin feel like it can't breathe.  I started wanting to take it off.  My skin felt oilier after I took it off, like the mask put my skin's oil production into overdrive.  My husband has a tattoo I tried to cover with this.  It covered the lighter colors up well, but it wouldn't cover the dark blue or the black lines.  It is water resistant.  It went through a shower without coming off, and hubby wore it into the pool and it stayed on where we'd put it.  It does come off with water based wipes though, if you wipe at it. I used Dove baby wipes and it came off with some wiping effort. Wiping at it seems to take it off pretty well without any special removers, but if just gets wet, it stays put at least for a bit.  It comes off really easy and fast with Neutrogena makeup remover clothes.  It does stay on longer if you use the setting powder.  It isn't particularly shiny, but the powder helps keep it from rubbing off if you rub your face, and it gives it a nice matte look and a bit more coverage.  It's ok.  I probably won't wear it again all over my face because I just felt like my skin was suffocating with it on.  I might use it for camouflaging red spots, freckles, spider veins, or bruises.  For tattoos, if they are light colors with little black this may well work, but the Dermablend stick does a better job of covering those, especially if they have dark colors and/or a lot of black.  This is very good coverage for smooth scars.  It also worked very well on the blue bruise I had on my leg.  It covered it very well.	1
Unless you have a deep tan or are otherwise brown-skinned, this honey shade will probably be too dark for you as it was for me. It applies darker than the color that shows through the tube--more of a light-medium brown. The shade was nice, just too dark for me and it applied smoothly. It covers well reminding me a bit of actor's pancake makeup in covering well, and I like that it's SPF 25. The pigment leaves a tint for a while after you remove it with water, that is, it does not wash off completely though it does wear off completely after washing (takes a few hours). If you get a shade you like, this would be a plus, as it covers well and lasts. .	1
The Dermablend SMOOTH Liquid Camo, color-Camel is a great color match on my fair complexion. I love the SPF 25 protection. However, Im very disappointed that the Medium Coverage foundation coverage foundation did not work for me. I followed the SMOOTH Liquid Camo application instructions to a tee.  After a few hours of wear my face became irritated, started burning and felt itchy. The liquid Camo clings to dry areas appears caked and scrabbly on my face It also made my pores appear larger than life by appearing more like white heads.  I'm glad this SMOOTH Liquid Camo works for so many other people and wished it worked for me too.	-1
Easy to apply, high coverage and provides some sunscreen protection as well.	1
Fantastic! Does a great job with coverage and staying on especially in hot summer months. Covers birthmarks and other flaws. Does not come off until you take it off. Wonderful product	1
Ok I tried the cinnamon one, it was a little too dark for my skin... my mother is a little darker than I am and it was almost too light for her... it kind of made her look ashy. For both of us, with a little extra blending, the product could work. It's of great quality and let me tell you it does not take a lot... which means this will last a long time.  It's also hard to get off...which is good and bad. It doesn't rub off on clothes but I had to scrub to get it off.  All in all, great product, not drying or caking.	1
It's pretty good but it's better for young skin. If you have any lines at all, it magnifies them. But if you don't have any lines, it's a very good product.	1
This liquid foundation is thinner in consistency and doesn't feel as creamy as my Clinique foundation. It goes on and dries very fast, so you have to smooth it on quickly to get an even coat. That said, it doesn't leave a tacky feeling and does provide full coverage. It covered my brown spots and uneven skin really well. I was definitely surprised how well it did that. I would say if you want medium coverage, you can dilute it with a moisturizer. I think this brand is really good quality and you can feel it on the skin. I have oily skin but if you have dry skin, you may need more moisturizing before putting this on. The hardest part was just picking the right shade. I don't think the pictures on their website helps that much. You definitely should go in the store to sample this.	1
Nice coverage and no rash. The ingredients seem good for a make-up product.  Very smooth and refined, not chunky.  The color works really well, but all colors are subjective. Kind of hard to tell how it will work in a computer screen.  Overall very satisfied.	1
DermaBlend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation covers up red spots and other imperfections on your face.  Apply to discolored areas, by using your fingertips or brush.  I prefer my fingertips.  Lightly tap the product over discolored areas, and blend gently.  The redness goes away.  The next step is to apply a setting powder. Just apply a small dusting of loose powder, using a large brush.  This quality foundation is a lifesaver for those of us with small blotches on our skin. It's excellent for me. I am a 53 year old woman and I am starting to see age spots.  This is a good product. Just find your shade.  Use it sparingly and this one fluid ounce bottle will last you several months.  It also has SPF to help protest your skin against damage from the sun and sunburn.  Use the smooth camo to dab over discolored areas, and you will be pleased.	1
I am quite happy with this foundation. It has a pretty good coverage and it masks considerable skin imperfections like acne. These guys have an impressive variety of shades and the color is true to the picture. The most important part for me is that the foundation is oil free and it does not aggravate my acne. My skin is very sensitive and most make up products just make me break out. Then I get it to the vicious circle of using more and more makeup to mask it which makes my skin even worse.	1
I do not wear heavy make-up. This was heavier then expected, but after putting it on, Blending it good, I thought it was more of a yellowish color on my skin! Im fair, blue eyes, and blonde weave. Im also older. That said, before putting this on, I used a nice moisturizer. After the Dermablend I put on a pink powder blush. I didn't notice the yellow then. It does cover very good. If I had anything under my skin, it did Not show up. My skin looked smooth. Btw, this is a SPF 25, I also put a little on the top of my hands. Looked good.  I went to the grocery store, and bumped into two friends separately,  I have not seen in a long time. One said, You never age, what is your secret!. I could not agree lol. Then another friend that I saw said, you look good, you never get older!!!..Ok, we now know this Dermablend does make me look younger, I have to say! My Granddaughter was in a bad car accident a few years ago (drunk driver hit her head on). She tried this Dermablend, and her face looked very smooth, and I could not see any glass marks on her face. That said, she does have nice skin, but after a few years she still will have glass come out of her skin!..  This is not a make-up I will use everyday, although its very nice. Although if you want good coverage, I think this would work good. Giving it 5 stars.	1
I'm fair/cool and normally when I select a new foundation to try I pick the shade next to the lightest of all shades, and it's almost always a good match.  Not with this shade, Cream 10N. It's like I've transformed into a vampire unless I put a light dusting of bronzer over it. Otherwise it's a good foundation. It's a neutral tone and not too yellow, not too pink. I use a slightly damp Takelon make-up brush but I put it on so sparingly I'm not sure if I'm getting the full effects of the SPF 25. I'm sensitive to scent and there is none. It covers my freckles across my cheeks & nose and a couple darker age spots with ease. I recommend going a shade darker than you normally do...maybe even 2 shades. I have slightly dry skin in the summer, and while this isn't moisturizing, it's not too drying either. I don't use the Dermablend setting powder and this stays on long enough for me....from 7 AM until I get home from work, around 5 PM.	1
The Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation has been working very well for my wife.  It provides excellent coverage without adding additional oiliness to her already oily skin.  The color cream is a good match for my light to medium color complexion.  The foundation includes SPF 25 which is a necessity for her since we live in sunny Southern California.  Since the coverage is better than the products she has used in the past she needed to use less product to avoid settling in pores and avoiding a heavy look.  She likes her makeup to look natural and she achieves that goal by smoothing the product around her face and using a small amount of foundation.  Her skin would definitely look too oily if she used more foundation and did not smooth it evenly around her face.  It seemed to last throughout the day despite her oily skin.  She would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for good coverage with sufficient sun protection.	1
For daily use, I stick with a tinted moisturizer having a high SPF. I just don't like the feel of foundation. But there are days I want to kick it up a notch, especially if I know people will be taking lots of photos. Despite having some years behind me, I have little problem with my skin. I just like to cover the spots (which are few, because they can be lasered off... that's the way to go!) and lighten the dark area around the outside of the eye. This medium coverage foundation is a good compromise for me. I don't really like the way it feels, but I can put up with it when I need to. The linen color is the lightest available Dermablend color and is good for my fair skin.	1
All Day Coverage!  I finally have tried DERMABLEND! It does cover very well. The trick is finding the right shade or shades for my mixed-race skin. I do need to remove this every evening without fail or my senile acne has a fit and the hyperpigmentation spots multiply. I believe this does it's job as advertised, I just need to do mine to have the best mature skin possible.	1
I am not happy with this makeupno matter how little I apply, it still feels heavy and settles into every flaw on my face.  The foundation may cover discolorations and even out skin tone, but it just doesnt look natural.  Seems more like a concealer than all-over face makeup.	-1
I love the Dermablend Smooth Liquid Foundation Makeup. The Chai color is perfect for my daughter and me. It is easy to apply as a makeup foundation and sun screen in one.  The directions suggest that you apply every 2 hours if you are in the sun, but I use it as a foundation and only apply once in the morning.	1
The significant other's complexion is a little bit darker, so lighter foundation does very little for her.  The color of this foundation is nearly perfect, being slightly darker than the significant other's skin.  To manage the color, the significant other spread the foundation until she got the color effect she wanted, which provided a color-smoothing effect on her skin.  The foundation seemed to have no odor at all to us, which is a plus given that the significant other would prefer to set her own odor.  I tried the foundation on the back of my hand to see how well it covered age-related blemishes, and it did really well.  I thought I had a bit of skin irritation for a short time after application, but that could have been psychosomatic because within minutes I noticed nothing.  This foundation is perfect for people with a slightly darker complexion, or when covering for darker spots might be needed.  The makeup goes on smoothly and evenly.  The lack of odor is a bonus.  Neither the significant other nor I noticed any issues with irritation (exclulding my temporary imagined irritation).  The price is a tad high, but the price is inline with the price of quality makeup.  We think this foundation deserves our four-star rating.  Enjoy!	1
A very nice and easy to apply medium coverage foundation. It stays put and keeps my skin looking flawless. I dab it on and apply with my makeup sponge. It lasts all day which is a huge plus!!!	1
The Dermablend went on smoothly and covered fairly well. The color was just right for my medium-olive toned skin. It didn't quite cover up an age spot I've had for years, but it did lighten up pretty well. The makeup didn't bother my dry skin, nor did it have an aroma. The only thing negative is the price. I suppose $37 (at the time of this review) may not be much for makeup for some women, but it's a bit pricey in my eyes. I do like the fact that it's SPF 25. That's a nice addition.	1
I was so surprised when I put it on, it actually covered my newly appearing age spots!  It made my skin look so much nicer now that the color is even all over.  It did not cover the darkness under my eyes, but it did lighten them.  I'm very pleased that it lasts all day. Go to their website for video tutorials on how to apply. Better yet, go to a store that sells the makeup to get the right color for your skin. They have 33 different shades. After you find the right shade for you, buy it on Amazon for the best prices!  Also, wanted to mention that I have very sensitive skin and this foundation did not cause any problems.	1
I've used ITcosmetics, Tarte and Laura Mercier.  Basically everything Ulta carries.  I got this to cover my dark circles under eyes and red splotches on cheeks.  IT Cosmetics usually is pretty good but with the summer heat, I wanted something more.  I started out with Clarins Beauty Balm as a primer and applied this.  It covered everything.  Smoothed out wrinkles and completely covered redness BUT I looked like a vampire.  It just didn't cover redness--it obliterated it.  But the coverage was great but so light on my face.  I walked out of the bathroom and my hubby about peed on himself.  I scared him and the dog who immediately jumped down and took off like shot leaving her beloved master to be killed by his undead looking wife.  It came off easy.  I used IT Cosmetics melting balm and with minimal cleansing, it's off.	1
This product gets an A plus at covering age spots. They disappear with the application. Since I have had several pre-cancer spots on my face removed, I really appreciate the protection of SPF of 25. That protection should be more than enough. Only problem that I have with it is remembering to put on again  two hours later. It comes in a small container with a cap that should not come off in my purse.  The color goes with my face great except my forehead which seems to be a lighter shade than the rest of my face. All in all, a good product.	1
Application on skin was smooth but then gelled in certain areas for an uneven look and finish.  Not great	-1
Some of the features are as follows:- 1) This shade of cedar/tan is darker for my skin shade. 2) It does not suit my skin type and does not provide the required hydration to skin. 3) The skin becomes dry after using it. Therefore I do not like it.	-1
I had heard of Dermablend makeup, but never tried it until I saw it available in the Amazon Vine program. Dermablend is makeup that helps hide imperfections, major and minor. I was interested to try it because I am getting dark spots on my face from past sun exposure. My daughter also wanted to try it to cover the few pimples she gets from time to time.  We also had an opportunity to try the Dermablend Intense PowderCamo.  Based on description and reviews  and cost  my daughter and I hoped the Dermablend Smooth Liquid Concealer Makeup would do a better job of hiding our flaws than our usual concealers. However, we both found this not to be the case.  We had the same disappointing results with the Dermablend Intense PowderCamo.  Obviously, skin types and imperfections vary by individual, and some people may find Dermablend makeup effective on their skin.  However, based on its price and our personal results, my daughter and I will not be buying Dermablend products.	-1
This did not work so well for me. The color was darker than I expected. It did not cover that well, even after applying several layers per directions. It was sticky and dried streaky. Try their camo version for better coverage.	-1
If I could give this product minus points, I would. It leaves a horrible orange looking paste all over your skin and eyebrows and sits on top of the skin as a very unnatural looking paste that is also horrible to feel. It's easily one of the worst products I have ever bought and I would not recommend it at all.	-1
I have only been using La Roche-Posay for a few days. My skin is a bit oily, and I'm older.  I found this to be drying, looked cakey, and felt heavy on my face. Which makes me look older. This has a very light wonderful scent to it.  I think my Olay Total effects, pore minimizer is more of Moisturizer, 15spf, with a nice lite coverage is by far better for me. (Got it from Amazon) Going to keep trying this when I don't go out. If I found this gets better with time, I will be back for a different review.	-1
To be fair, the only make-up I use is mascara and lipstick.  That said, my lipstick did not set and was easily came off on my husband's lips and my mascara ran.  Also, for a few minutes after I sprayed the solution on my face, it made my face sticky.  That cleared up totally after a half hour or so. My guess is that this would better serve people who use foundation.  But I don't know for sure.	-1
I received a small bottle of Nia 24 Treatment Catalyst, 0.5 oz in exchange for my review.  I had seen the price set at $71.00 and I thought for that amount of money it better work.  I have used it for about a week and a half.  That is hardly enough time to tell if a new product works.  However, after the first use, I woke up the next morning and had blemishes on my face. They were on my nose and around my nose and a small blemish on my chin.  I thought well, it's a new product sometimes breakouts happen and I will just use it once at night and see how it goes.  The first use was with the Nia 24 Treatment by itself.  I used three drops and had a hard time getting it smoothed over my skin.  This did not seem to be an adequate amount to provide full coverage on my face. The next morning I mixed three drops with my moisturizer and used it that way for three days.  I used it every morning and night, but every morning I woke up, looked in the mirror and had two to three new blemishes.  By the end of the few days I used the product, my face looked like I was going through puberty.  I am in my fifties.  How embarrassing.  I had these awful blemishes on my nose, cheek and chin.  Mainly however, the breakouts were on my nose.  So after the first few uses of morning and evening, I thought I will not put any on my nose and see if this really is the cause of my breakouts.  My nose remained clear after a couple of days, but I still had breakouts on my cheeks and chin.  I then switched to just using it at night.  Finally, the last night I used it and woke up again in the morning with more blemishes, I said that's it.  I have had enough.  My skin is still recovering from all of the breakouts over the past week and a half.  Unfortunately, I did not notice any change in my skin as to less lines, softness, and smoothness.  I don't really have a problem with skin products causing breakouts.  I use a lot of different products.  With this product, my face would continue to break out even in the middle of the afternoon.  I would go to the restroom and there would be another blemish on my nose. I believe my skin was just too sensitive for this product.  I also believe that even if I had noticed any improvement, I would not be paying $71.00 for a skin product.  I find that amount to be a bit lavish for someone like me who works for a living and has to live on a tight budget.  Overall, I cannot recommend this product.  It may work for others, but my skin could not take any more.	-1
I didn't notice anything special about this eyelash curler.  The curler pads are pretty, and the tool itself is sturdy, but it still pinched my eyelid.  And it seems like it takes more work to get my eyelashes to curl than my usual Shiseido lash curler.	-1
Despite an interesting list of ingredients, including fragrance, the abundant thickening agents make this product difficult to use.  It has the viscosity of Play-Doh, and very slick slip agents.  There is no dipping of fingertips to remove product.  Rather, one must apply pressure and dig it out of the jar, but it does spread nicely.  I used this for two weeks with no apparent effects until about day twelve, when my skin began feeling tight and itchy.  Since I wasn't seeing anything happening, except redness, which isn't unusual for my skin, I got a bit bored and at the two week mark, switched back to my normal skin-care routine.  The very next day my husband told me my skin looked much better; the redness was gone.  He didn't know I'd stopped using this cream.  He just made the observation.  I was using it, but he came up with the testimonial.  Not recommended.	-1
I wanted to like this, I really did.  The description sounded intriguing, and I love scents with pepper and sandalwood as notes.  The bottle is interestingly shaped, and holds a generous amount of scent.  I open the package, remove the rounded square bottle, take off the cap and spray lightly in the air, walking through the mist.  I smell nothing but generic CK scent-vaguely artificial and synthetic.  A few minutes later I begin to get a headache.  I try again the next day, and the same thing happens.  It lingers on clothing and the skin, lasting through a shower, or several days in the closet (some spray got on a sweater).  I let my daughter try it, and thank goodness she went to school shortly after, as even on someone else it was triggering a headache.  I am glad that so many people like this scent, it just is not for me.  I cannot give it to my daughter to use, unless I want to move out of my house.  I will dispose of this as soon as I am able.	-1
I have VERY sensitive skin and the first few days I used this cream it made me a bit red here and there (no rash, just sorta looked irritated and inflamed).  After about 3 days, the irritation went away and it did start moisturizing my skin.  It has a very luxurious feel to it-it spreads nicely and covers thoroughly and a little goes a long way (which is good b/c you only get a little in this package).  I does seem to have tightened/filled in the lines under my eyes a small amount, but nothing super noticeable.  Overall, for the price, I'd say "pass" on this one-it is rough on sensitive skin and the benefits are very minimally noticeable.	-1
Once again, I get to embarrass myself in the interest of saving my Amazon friends a few bucks. A few years back I decided the best way to test an expensive skin cream to see if it really lived up to its promises was to actually test it head-to-head against the inexpensive stuff I typically used. My results from that test proved to me the cheap stuff was just fine. When I had a chance to get a batch of this StriVectinLABS cream I thought it was time for another test.  Unfortunately, this means putting close-up photos of my 50+ year old makeup-free face out there for everyone to see. Ugh. Oh well, at least I've still got my sparkling personality and great sense of humor to keep humanity from ostracizing me.  This test was performed using my regular Neutrogena Rapid Tone repair on the left side of my face, and the StriVectinLABS Extreme Cream on the right. I washed my face using my regular liquid Neutrogena twice a day, and applied both lotions morning and before bed every day for 15 days.  Overall, I like the feeling of the StriVectin Extreme Cream, it is rich without feeling heavy or greasy, my makeup applies nicely over the top of it. The smell is not organic, it's more medicinal, sort of like Witch Hazel. That's fine with me, since I find some floral scents irritating. I also like that a little goes a long way with the Extreme Cream, it's easy to apply a very small amount and get smooth and even coverage.  So, it feels nice, how does it work? I see no visible difference after 2 weeks. The photos show the same thing, no difference with the possible exception of slightly softer fine lines around my eyes, although this might be attributed to softer ambient light seen in the second set of photos.  Before photos were taken with natural and fluorescent light at 1pm using my Canon SL1 with the same settings and white balance for both sets of photos. Light and white balance were somewhat different due to a cloudy day during the second set.  My conclusion is that either the Neutrogena and StriVectin are both not doing a darned thing for my skin, or that both are doing something and doing it equally well, either way, it's not exactly a ringing endorsement for the very spendy StriVectinLABS product.  I will continue this test for another two weeks and report back with any further changes/findings.  --------------  Update 12/29/2014  I've continued using the StriVectinLABs Extreme Cream, now on both sides of my face. There is no change in feel or appearance of my skin when compared with the "before" photos, so unfortunately there's no great miracle that occurs after using this product for more than a month. It does feel good and is very easy to apply, so I'll continue using it, but I definitely won't be buying any when this container is empty.	-1
I take a bubble bath every day and have for years. When I saw I was offered this pricey bubble bath via the Amazon Vine program, I was thrilled. At $38, I imagined it would at least be very good.  I was sent the Prosecco (Champagne) scent. The company lists the fragrance notes exactly the way one would with perfume. "Top notes of Satsuma citrus. . ." was there (well, at least the sense of citrus) and and quite nice, but like most top notes, it faded quickly. As one fills the bath with hot water, the other notes all combine into what I call "nice shampoo smell." Fruity & sweet, but without much character.  Now, the bubbles. I read the other reviews and I wonder how much of this product people used. Indeed, one reviewer seemed to suggest there was enough of this for five or six baths! This is a big bottle. It should last a good long time.  I put about one heaping tablespoon in my bath. This is the amount I use with every other bubble bath product I like and use. With this product, I got about an inch of large bubbles that dissipated quickly. A truly good bubble bath produces lots of small foaming bubbles that hold up for the duration of the bath. This product did not do that with an amount that is reasonable for one use.  Additionally, after the bath, I do feel a dry residue of product on my skin that begs for a shower and some moisturizer. I don't feel that way with other bubble baths I use. I will not use this again. For the price, there are many really excellent bubble bath products out there, some of which cost less than 1/3rd the price.	-1
It was used on a smaller face during testing, and the user did not like how it puckered the face during use.  With prolonged use pulling the skin forward, it is likely to cause more wrinkles.  One has to pull it back with the hand during use, which is inconvenient.  If you have a medium to large face, it should be a good fit.  We did not experience significant changes after a couple of week of use, and have gone back to the neon tube d'arsenval machine which shows immediate results.	-1
The XEN-TAN products are some of the priciest on the market yet I'm not sure they deliver as promised. The Moroccan Tan Ultra is supposed to be one of their longest lasting self tanners yet my experience was disappointing. Each XEN-TAN product is quite time consuming to use, both in the application and the drying time of the tanner. I probably wouldn't mind so much if the color truly lasted a long as the manufacturer claims but that has not been the case. The color itself is one of the best in the XEN-TAN line but despite following directions carefully, it wore off in less than 48 hours. When you factor in price, inconvenient application and less than expected color longevity, this is not for everyone.	-1
This is an eyeliner that requires sharpening and like other eyeliners I've tried that need to be sharpened, I found that it does not go on as smoothly as gel liners.  Even in comparison to other pencils, it skips more and leaves messy gaps.  Also, the line it creates is very thin, so the smudger at the other end is definitely needed if you prefer a thicker line as I do. It is a good, dark black color that lasted for a few hours, but the application process was too lacking for me to choose Jillian Dempsey over other pencils like Clinique.	-1
My girlfriend is always excited to try new cosmetics. I gave her the Jillian Dempsey Natural Khol Eyeliner - Rich Brown, to try because I thought she might like it. This review is her experience with the product.  I had high hopes for the Jillian Dempsey Waterproof Kohl Eyeliner because it has three great features:  1. Waterproof 2. Not tested on animals 3. Plant-derived oil and wax based ingredients. No synthetic chemicals or preservatives.  The eyeliner color states rich brown, it's more of a reddish brown when applied. I prefer a neutral brown, not too cool or warm. I have blue eyes, brown hair and fair cool toned skin with pink under tones. The rich brown is too red, harsh and dark even with smudging it to soften the look.  The eyeliner is creamy upon application, however it seems to skip a bit. I will note that I don't have oily lids/skin and it's fall so the weather is cool.  I first applied the eyeliner to my upper lids and water line without my contacts in.  I didn't use the smudger tip to gauge the longevity of the eyeliner.  I checked the mirror 30 minutes later and the eyeliner had smeared and melted. I looked like a hot mess. I was glad to be home and not in public.  The smudge tip is a sponge and wipes the color off your eyes, it defeats the purpose. I use Rimmel Scandaleyes Khol waterproof eyeliner, which I love - no problems with raccoon eyes and it's inexpensive.  I really wanted to like this eyeliner but I can't recommend it because it doesn't live up to it's claim and is expensive.  ** NOT RECOMMENDED! - 2 STARS **	-1
My daughter is an amazing, self-taught make up artist.  Although she did spend six months at the Aveda school learning new techniques, this is a young woman who made it her business, from a very young age, to know everything about make up.  I thought I'd check out this product, and discuss her views.  First off, the box it arrived in was crushed.  With an item as pricey as this, presentation means something, although it hasn't affected this review.  While the colors were rich and deep, the color material was too malleable to create a straight line, which may be why there is a "smudger" attached (a recognition that you probably won't be able to get a straight line?).  It does not apply well over eyeshadow, but suffices for bottom eyeliner.  For this price, there are other brands that you can get at a high end make up store for a similar that can be used for multiple purposes and don't suffer from these problems.  The pencils did not arrive in time for me to use this Halloween, but next year .... Rocky Horror!	-1
This actually went terribly for me.  According to the ingredients list, I'm not allergic to any of the things included in the bottle, but when I put it on I immediately experienced a burning sensation.  Right after that my eyes swelled up so that it looked like I'd been punched in the face.  Itchy, painful and red!  I put a cold compress on my face and went to bed.  The next morning my lids were still super puffy and irritated, so I put some soothing cream on them and left them alone.  I'm not sure exactly what happened there, but it was a very bad experience.	-1
What I like about this eye cream: 1. It does not hurt my eyes if some gets in them - which is great because I wear contacts. 2. A little goes a long long way 3. There's no scent  What could be better: 1. It does not absorb. I'll put it on when I wake up and go to work and notice it's still sitting on top of my skin at lunch time. It's hard to not rub my eyes. 2. If I push the pump all the way down, I get almost enough cream for my whole face. It only takes a little drop - or quick press to do both of my eyes. 3. I've been using this for 2 weeks. No change. I took a picture of my eye before to make sure I wasn't missing anything. 4. It did not soften, brighten or remove any puffiness.  The cream is in a nice dispenser and a little goes a long, long way. It glides on nice and I would love to give this stuff 5 stars. BUT... but... the whole purpose of it is to, and I quote, "Reduces the signs of aging, soothes, brightens, reduces puffiness and provides a more rested, youthful appearance." and, per the description, "This gentle and highly effective eye treatment moisturizer, powered by plant technology, minimizes the appearance of fine lines and crows feet for a younger-looking, brighter appearance."  It just doesn't do what it claims.	-1
I am a wet shaver who uses a double-edge safety razor.  I have tried a number of different aftershave lotions, tonics, splashes, and balms.  This one didn't do it for me.  First off, there is no ingredient list on the Amazon page.  This product contains four different parabens.  Parabens are xenoestrogens, not exactly the sort of stuff a guy wants to have absorbing through his skin on a daily basis.  Second, the scent is medicinal and not that pleasant.  As someone else mentioned, it smells quite a bit like Mentholatum, probably because of the camphor component.  Third, I did not find this product as soothing as other splashes, lotions, or tonics I have tried from Proraso, Barrister and Mann, Chiseled Face, or  Pure Body Naturals, all of which are substantially less expensive and do not contain parabens.  In sum, you can do a lot better for the price and can avoid parabens at the same time.	-1
As most reviewers of this product has already commented that while the scent is good it does not last very long. The bottle and packaging is very attractive as gift and the pump/spray works good in spraying the scent. It has a good scent resembling more of woodsy type and settles towards more floral / citrus notes which I liked but then within about 20-30 mins after applying it I could no longer smell it. For the asking price it is little too expensive especially knowing that it does not linger long enough where applied. I am sorry to rate this with 2 stars since the price is weighing in on it. I wish it lingered long enough to appreciate the nice smell.	-1
At first spritz, the scent is a weak citrus that didn't really impress me.  It just didn't seem to have any depth, just a single, non-descript citrus note which I couldn't identify as lemon, lime, orange or grapefruit.  Immediately after spraying, I asked my husband, sitting 2 feet away, how he liked it and he said he couldn't smell anything at all.  After 30 minutes, the scent was completely undetectable even while inhaling deeply from my wrist.  Good thing I didn't really care for the scent in the first place.	-1
This is one of those perfumes that causes headaches for me. Thank goodness the other reviewers weren't kidding when they said the scent doesn't last! I sprayed it on and within an hour the scent was completely gone. This is a very unisex scent that misses the mark - it's too masculine for a woman to wear and too feminine for a man to wear. I have no idea how Oribe thinks it's a good idea to charge $95 for this. This isn't worth the price by any means. It absolutely does NOT smell like their hair products.	-1
*********UPDATE ********* So I've had this hair curler for 1.5 years now.  Honestly, after the first 3 weeks, I stopped using it.  Not because it was heavy.  Not because I was worried about damaging my hair. But because people told me my hair looked TERRIBLE!  The curls don't come out natural looking.  Yeah, they're curly, but there's a weird kink where your hair goes from straight-to-curly.  I wanted the entire length of hair to be curly so I used it as close as possible to my scalp as all the instructions/tutorials said.  It still leaves a weird straight area (about 1.5-2" from your scalp) and then this weird crinkly curl starts.  It's not a round big bouncy soft curl.  It's a tight, kinked, krinkly, uneven curl that looks lifeless.  I was so excited that a curl actually would *stay* in my hair...but the "curl" is so ugly that it's not worth it.  I'm sticking with hot rollers and big barrel curling irons from now on.  If anybody wants to buy this from me, I'll sell this to you cheap.  Only used for 3 weeks. So sad that I spent so much on something I used for 3 weeks. :(  _________________  OLD REVIEW _________________ I got mine and checked it against online tutorials teaching people how to decide if it's real or fake. I think mine is real. It works well but I realize that your hair has to be really dry for the curls to be actually curly. I had taken a shower and let my hair air dry for a day. I figured that was okay, but it's hot and humid right now and I noticed my "curls" (using the highest heat setting and the longest set time) were limp. I had to dry my hair with a blower dryer and then try again - then it worked quite well!  One thing I noticed is that the babyliss miracurl steamtech I got had a grey felt patch at the center of the curling mechanism (whereas online, it shows a plastic circle with concentric rings on it). I think the computer generated image online (even at the babyliss website) has the concentric circles whereas most people who have posted pics of their real babyliss (bought from verified sellers) have the grey felt. So just wanted to mention that in case people were worried.  I have stick straight Asian curl that got two perms over two weeks and still was straight afterwards. Seriously! I curled my hair about 4 hours ago and the curl is still there and looking great despite it being crazy humid and hot! This thing is awesome! (Though I really hope I'm not damaging my hair with the heat!)	-1
I've been using a "chin" cream for years now, I can't even remember the name but I got it from Evine.  It's sad when even your chin needs attention. So I was excited to try this. To try and get my jowl-y cheeks and chin to firm up.  Maybe it's the new formula or the roller, but I don't like it.  It fits awkwardly around my neck as if the roller is too small. I spend more time putting it on than a full face of makeup.  As for results, nothing yet. But I've not used it as much as I should as it's so annoying.	-1
This cream is easy to apply. It doesn't smell bad and the roller does an okay job at application, although I found it easier to spread the cream with my fingertips.  I used the cream for 10 days and did not notice any change to the crepey appearance on the skin of my neck. However, my skin did turn red. The package directions insert said if skin is sensitive, apply sparingly for 7 to 10 days to allow time for the skin to adjust. My skin looked just as red after 10 days so I ceased using it. Still, the fine crepey lines were still there and my neck did not look tighter. While I didn't expect a change to my profile or age-related sagging, since that's impossible with a skin cream, I hoped the crepey appearance would be improved. I'm assuming this topical cream contains an ingredient that tightens as it dries, much like the egg white trick.  I was curious about the claims in the description, such as stating 86 percent felt tighter skin. I wrote the company to ask how many people were surveyed, was this a clinical study, and what were the average ages of those who participated. It's been 10 days and they still have not responded.  This is not a product that I would recommend to my own family and friends. I found that it did not live up to the claims of tightening my skin. It is a decent moisturizer and works as well as any drugstore product. However, I don't think it's worth the high price, especially since many people get bad reactions from the niacin ingredient in the cream. That's just my personal opinion.	-1
Gave this to my spouse who applied it twice. I asked if it had any odor and she asked me to smell her neck which I did and found it odorless. I asked her what her rating would be and she replied "One star".	-1
I have been using this morning and night for about two weeks, and it does seem to provide some tightening to the skin on my neck.  It feels very similar to some night cream that I have used, so I think it might have some similar qualities as that type of anti-aging night cream lotion.  This is a small container that will not last long; however, even with a short time of use, I think it has had beneficial effects however after the two weeks it seems to have a thinning, weathering effect on my skin, so I'm taking a break from it.  I have used it on my neck after shaving and it is soothing also but the recent effects are concerning.  The area around the bottom of my neck and top of my chest has begun to redden.  After using at night, I notice in the morning that area of my skin is red -- like a sunburn.  So I'm stopping the use of this.	-1
Maybe this doesn't mix well with my skin chemistry, I tried it on hand, cheek, neck and chest, with poor results.  I was surprised with the description which is smoky leather, I envisioned cowboys at a camp fire.  I didn't get that out of it, the first was mostly a rubbing alcohol smell then a strong hint of citrus, then sort of a musk.  The musk was not bad, but not enough to pay 80 buck for even a bottle this large.  Stick with the cheaper brands, this is a pedestrian scent with a CEO's price.  The bottle is nice and the sprayer top does a nice job spraying it on, but I think you can get a bottle of something as good for in the 10-15 dollar neighborhood.  Maybe its me or men in general, having the opportunity to try these was fine, but I could never see me spending this kind of money unless it were something special.  I reviewed a Calvin Klein fragrance recently that I could almost say that about, but it either worked better with my chemistry or it was just better period.  I can't recommend this, but if you think you'd like a citrus musk type scent, Try it out at a high end mall store where they might display that, if you can honestly say you like it, and you don't mind dropping eighty bucks on mens scents, go for it.	-1
This extremely expensive alpha hydroxy cream is marketed as a skin brightener and, in that sense, I guess it kind of worked since my skin was bright after a single use  BRIGHT RED that is.  After only an hour or so of wear  all indoors, so no sun exposure -- I began to have a terrible blotchy red reaction, and I don't have extremely sensitive skin. (Have only ever had one slightly bad reaction before, to a ROC cream.)  Washed my face multiple times and applied extra moisturizer, cold cream and, eventually, dots of Benadryl cream to calm the blotches. It wasn't painful, but it looked terrible and scary and I cant imagine what would have happened had I gone in sunlight, as this product specifically and adamantly warns against, or used it twice daily, as the directions instruct.  Yikes. Never again.	-1
I received this item for review from the Amazon Vine Program, however what shocks me is that after doing some online research it is not available in some states, specifically MA, MT, NH, NY, and TX.  I live in New York and these states do not permit physicians to sell medications in their offices. The Nu-Derm Fx Products are sold as an non-prescription alternative directly from your doctor's office.  So I am confused how Amazon can sell it directly to consumers.  The bottle looks authentic even though it arrives with no documentation or does not even arrive in a box.  No directions and good luck reading the tiny small print on the back of the bottle.  The thought of a prescription strength cream that would be able to help disappear the signs of aging and dark spots sounds great, but the possible side effects of the controversial drug hydroquinone (skin lighter) is enough to scare me away.  Obagi uses arbutin which is a form of a glycosylated hydroquinone.  "Effective options to help clarify and brighten your skin with arbutin, a skin brightener. Obagi Nu-Derm is a trademark of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. or its affiliates. OBG.0241. USA.16"  Hydroquinone is even banned from The UK, Japan and Canada. It has been linked to cancer, organ toxicity, and respiratory tract irritation if inhaled through the nose or mouth. It is currently under review by the FDA. Obagi has not been on the market long enough to know how it will affect people for long periods of time, so depending on the FDA results it may become banned in the USA as well.  It is not recommended for individuals who suffer from Asthma because Obagi Clear contains sodium metabisulfite.  It even states not to use other products with the Obagi system!  With descriptions and information like this who wants the risk of using this.	-1
A little goes a long way so I wasn't scared by the thought of purchasing this in the future. However, I didn't see the results I was hoping for. I was pretty consistent, 2x/day for a month and didn't notice any significant change to the scarring (due to a previous staph infection) on my face. It also has a gross consistentcy and mild yet unpleasant odor.	-1
Initially when I put this on, I did feel some stinging, but has since subsided. This item came with no directions on how long to use this product for, but for the past few week I've been using it, I've seen no results.	-1
I decided that I would review a skincare product for once instead of my better half. Since I work indoors and am essentially avoiding sunlight for 70 hours a week, I thought I could use some pampering and use some "skin brightening". However, my skin didn't tolerate this well (I tried at the back of my neck) - even with avoiding the sun, my skin got pretty red and slightly painful. It did make me nervous because I'm very pale, and if I went out into the sun it would probably hurt very badly.  So I gave up, and threw this in the trash. I mean, it might work for you, but they really need to sell sample sized bottles of this so it doesn't make you feel like you're throwing away $100 worth of product when it doesn't work for you.	-1
Will not charge and the company will not refund your money.  BUYER BEWARE	-1
I did research before I purchased this line of products , but was enough to use for 2 days that i got very bad reaction on my face, burning, red swelling and I am in pain, I will never ever buy these products again	-1
This cleansing oil disappointed me. For the price I was hoping to find something I would love, but it left my skin feeling oily like I had to double cleanse. Also I would get a film in my eyes from using it to take off my eye makeup. I stopped using it on my face and now I'm trying to use it up by cleaning my brushes with it.	-1
This is a non-foaming cleansing oil that works okay, but doesn't really take off mascara very easily, even non-waterproof mascara. I don't wear much makeup (a mineral foundation, some blush, a coat of mascara) and even after using this product like a wash (using my hands), some of my makeup remained and I had to use some on a cotton ball to get off the rest of it. It has an odd odor (perhaps the Shea oil) that I didn't particularly care for and it didn't leave my skin feeling clean. I have combination skin and I do enjoy a nice scrubbed face, so it might just be that this product and I are not a good fit. It would probably be nice for people with extremely sensitive or dry skin, but it sure didn't work for me.	-1
I was very excited to try this.  I've long wanted to try the Shu Uemura or Rodin facial cleansing oils, but they're just so darned expensive.  In recent years, the market seems to have been flooded with similar products at all price points but, with the exception of several free samples from the Japanese company DHC, I've still never bothered to pick one up.  I usually remove my eye make-up with Cetaphil and cleanse the rest of my face with an exfoliating product, so I've never felt the urge to stray from what works for me.  But since this was being offered as a free trial, I figured why not?  When it arrived, I immediately opened it and squirted a bit on my fingers.  My first impression was that it reminded me a bit of baby oil - the fragrance and consistency.  Very different than the DHC oil which was light and almost odorless.  Not off to a good start.  However, once activated with water the oil easily emulsified into a thin, slippery fluid and created a low grade lather that felt nice and rinsed easily.  My skin felt smooth, firm and moisturized afterward.  I was sold.  But the story doesn't end there.  After two days use, I noticed a number of clogged pores and two blemishes.  Now, I haven't had a blemish in years.  Years and years and years.  I honestly thought that any concern over zits was well behind me at this point, but I suppose I've just been using the right cosmetics and treatment products.  I tried the oil for one more night before finally calling it quits.  This seems like a high quality item and it may work for some, but I'm too old to be dealing with breakouts.	-1
This is the first moisturiser to ever give me zits.	-1
It just did not work, despite the impressive packaging and attention to detail in the design and construction.	-1
Very confusing to get to operate.  Have to be an electrical genius; cannot get mine to work.  Sending back.  I would rather pay for immediate results if I am going to spend this much money.\	-1
I received the iluminage Skin Smoothing Laser for my honest review. I have wanted to look into what is advertised in my city as laser light treatments.  I have reached the age where this is something I think could benefit me.  So with much delight I ordered the iluminage Skin Smoothing Laser hoping for younger looking skin.  Per the description of the iluminage Skin Smoothing Laser it states The skin smoothing laser delivers pulses of laser light below the surface of the skin, where wrinkles form. This technology is known to trigger the body's natural response to generate new collagen fibers. Skin's support structure is reinforced from within-significantly reducing wrinkles. Safe enough to use at home, yet as effective as professional lasers for the treatment of facial wrinkles, such as wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.  I was very excited to try this and read the instruction manual at least six to seven times cover to cover. I had no experience with laser treatments and I wanted to be very safe and sure about using it.  I charged it immediately as the instruction manual stated there would not be a full charge on the laser.  With great anticipation, I used it the next night firmly aware that there may be slight stinging and redness.  I first tried it on my forearm as stated in the instructions.  I had two red welts on my forearm for a full 24 hours.  This did not deter me in any way.  I used the laser, and yes it stings.  I compare it to many, many bee stings.  After a full four zone use (this is the recommendation in the manual) and 40 pulses per zone, my face was intensely red and my skin had welts all over.  The stinging persisted for 25 to 30 minutes.  It was very painful.  I had to take some ibuprofen for the pain.  The next morning I still had redness on both checks.  I used it again that evening, same thing happened, intense stinging and redness and pain.  I took ibuprofen again.  The third night I was getting ready to use the laser and my husband said, I wouldnt use that as your face looks quite puffy!  Now, I have been married for nearly 30 years and I have never heard those words out of my husbands mouth.  Your face looks puffy!  So, I decided, per the manual instructions, that I should skip a night as I have never had any type of laser treatment done and apparently my skin was quite sensitive.  However, this still did not deter me from my quest for younger looking skin.  I have regularly used this laser treatment almost every night for three weeks.  I even took a before picture before I started.  I took an after picture last night and compared the two.  Unfortunately, I see no difference whatsoever.  I specifically wanted to try this laser treatment for my smoker lines on my lips.  I have not smoked in years, but I still have the lines to prove that I did once smoke.  Also, I am beginning to see lines around my nose area and into my forehead at the top of the nose between the eyebrows.  However, the forehead is not a zone and the instruction manual says not to use this laser on any other area but the four zones.  They are underneath the eye and around the cheeks, around the mouth and chin.  I wanted this to work so badly that I proceeded to use it every night with the stinging and pain and yes it does sting and it is painful.  I spent every night I used it with burning and redness.  I did find if I used a moisturizer right after, the redness did not last but the stinging did.  As the nights went by, I did have fewer welts on my face and the redness did not last as long, but I still had intense stinging after use for at least 15 to 20 minutes every night.  So, after three weeks of conscientious use, I see no improvement in the appearance of lines, wrinkles, or skin tone.  I will however, continue to use it hoping that eventually I will see some improvement.  If not, I will stop as I cannot even begin to imagine continuing to use this laser treatment every night, experiencing pain, and no results.  I am hoping to gradually see less lines and wrinkles.  Can I recommend this product?  Not at this point in time.  I will attempt to update if I do experience the results I am truly looking for.	-1
I tried my best to ignore the pain but I just could not get past two rounds of treatment, even at the lowest setting. Not that it was excruciating but it was just so unpleasant that I did not feel it was worth it. Plus my face was red for hours. Thus, I do not know if it works at all. If you are used to laser treatments at the doctor's office then you will probably be fine. If you're like me - someone who has never had any laser treatments before using this device - then I would say consider your pain threshold very carefully before paying for this product. The manual states that regular use will result in diminished sensation of pain but unfortunately I could not continue.  Otherwise, I found it very easy to use. There are sound and display indicators which lets you know the setting, how many pulses you've done, assessment reminders, and whether the laser pulse was properly delivered. In addition, once you reach the maximum amount of pulses per treatment, the entire thing will shut down for four hours to prevent excessive use.  I also found the design to be aesthetically pleasing, an elegant device on my bathroom counter.	-1
They say, "No Pain, No Gain." This product works BUT, it comes at a price.	-1
Scared the ^%^%% out of me!! Have used before. Then, one day it kept curling and wouldn't stop the rolling mechanism!!! It hit my scalp, was SCORCHING HOT, and scared me to death!  What if it hadn't stopped??? I unplugged as fast as I could!! I'm too scared to use again :(( I missed the return date by TWO days :(((	-1
As a corrective concealer this product does work.  However the consistency of the product was too thick.  I have European Caucasian skin and I am at the half century mark.  I thought this would be a good product for me.  However, I think the product is old and lost some of its moisture.  I also have been told not to stretch my skin too much as it will cause wrinkles.  Applying this product, well, I had to really rub and stretch and pull my skin, a lot.  I was like clay or old glue.  I have used thick concealers before and they always have an oil or something to make them apply easily.  Another problem I had was the packaging.  Women my age are the primary target for this product.  However, I couldn't read the packaging.  This product is made in the USA so why not omit the French and put the information on the package & jar in English with larger lettering?  I got this product free for a honest review, but I don't see paying $35 for a jar of clay.  I really didn't see any "Anti-Wrinkle" qualities in this product.  Yes, it does get rid of dark circles, but that is more because it was soooo thick.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either.	-1
I was very interested to try this thirty-five-dollar concealer as I've been searching for one that met my needs. I'm disappointed by this one, unfortunately, although I had wanted to like it.  This is a generous pot of concealer, it will last a long time for the average user. The texture of the product is what got me, in that it does not apply well to under eye areas--despite the claim that this product is great for under eye areas and reduces winkles in said areas. I tried this concealer out in a variety of ways, using fingers to apply as well as a concealing brush. Note that the product suggests using a brush to dole out the product onto the back of your wrist, then from there to apply with the brush to your face.  I will say, I was pleased with how this product covered blemishes, quite well, when using a concealer brush. As for the undereye area? Which is big for me, as I'm a fair skinned lady of Swedish descent who has dark circles to cover, this product did not meet my expectations. It was hard and too dry to apply easily to the under-eye area well. Worse, I'd apply then move onto my foundation (which is quality product, Vincent Longo's Water Canvas Foundation) and this concealer would then gum up under my eyes. It didn't "play well with others" so to speak. When looking close up in the mirror, this product was OBVIOUS and easily seen on the eye. It didn't crease, but it "gunked up" on top of my skin and that I just cannot stand.  Also, it has a warm, yellowish tone, which is great if you're Asian but for a fair skinned Swede (with pink skin tones, not warm) it was just awful. This is what I can't understand about the beauty industry: every "fair" skinned product is made for warm skinned people. Meanwhile, there is a world of cool toned, Scandinavian skinned people out there needing COOL TONED products that the beauty industry is completely ignoring.  The texture was a miss as well, this product was just hard to apply well in that it is a hard creamy yet chalky consistency, like what you might find in a concealer stick that you twist to use. You can scoop it up on a brush, but as soon as it hits skin and air it starts drying and becomes difficult to smooth, I felt like I was smudging it onto my skin and this is not a pleasant thing when you're messing with delicate, under-eye skin. I really hate the texture of this concealer, overall.  However, I must say it did do well in covering up small red blemishes when applied with a small concealer brush. Unfortunately for them, but fortunately for ME, I do not get small red blemishes very often. So this product is very unhelpful overall, in my opinion. They would do well to 1) make a shade for cool toned fair skin and 2) create a product that is easily applied, this thick cream isn't cutting it and does not work--especially considering the claims they make for this product being good for the under-eye area as well as good for hiding tired, wrinkled eyes.	-1
I received this in exchange for my honest review.  In order to assess the value of a review for your own personal buying decision, I think it's important to understand the preferences of the reviewer.  I adore scent.  I favor somewhat pungent natural fragrances with strong notes of rose, cumin, amber, but also some soliflores.  My own personal fragrances tend to come from places like Andy Tauer (Une Rose Chypree), LeLabo (Rose31) and Annick Goutal (Rose Absolue, Eau de Charlotte).  Formy husband I like Serge Lutens Chergui.  So, if you do not share my tastes, what I have to say about Burberry Brit will not be relevant to you.  I found this to be a  generic modern chemical ozonic  rather sweet fragrance, not very easily distinguishable from many that you can sample at Sephora.  To my nose it has more in common with the scent of dryer sheets than the kind of fragrance I am drawn to.  Very little silage, but it is quite long lasting on the skin.  Fragrance is a very personal thing.  For me personally it is not a match.  Neither on me nor my husband.  Your mileage may vary, as they say.	-1
Still waiting for results...I have used on my forehead for the past two weeks and don't really see any results.  I do feel a tingely sensation right after application. The packaging says instantly releases creases and erase expression lines. Not seeing that yet; will continue to use the remainder of the bottle and post if there's a change.	-1
All hype - no substance - and at an outrageous price tag.  The Dr. Brandt at-home solution for wrinkle relaxing did zero to any line on my face.  Im one of those lucky people who has very little facial creasing at my ripe old age.  I occasionally get the bug to try to eliminate those that I do have and have found some products that superficially fill a tiny bit.  Unfortunately Dr. Brandt Needles No More is not one of them.  On the plus side the solution has a pleasant aroma and the texture feels soothing  much like Nivea cream.  The big minus is that I personally think that any product that implies that it will work like Botox is setting itself up to disappoint its customers.  Thumbs down from me.	-1
I have used this wrinkle relaxer for three days without noticeable changes except for one; today I woke with a painful, although small, lump right at the edge of my eye socket where the crows feet begin.  It did not improve during the day, so I conclude that I am reacting to some ingredient in this product.  I have been careful to keep the product away from my eyes, so they are fine, but this lump is something I have never experienced before.  This is not the product for me. I will not be using it again.  ONE STAR!	-1
Okay. Let's just acknowledge from the outset in my opinion this product requires a degree of discipline in application on a daily basis to achieve even modest improvement in long term effects that I simply do not possess.  I'm not going to follow a regimen of twice per day application any more than I am likely to scrub my face with some cleansing astringent on a daily basis. That I am lazy is evident but more to the point, crow's feet and forehead wrinkles just don't rate very high on my list of personal concerns. If this stuff combated age related sag leading to triple chin, yeah maybe, but I'm more likely to grow a beard and call it a look.  So, I suppose I could also state equally as forcefully, this stuff isn't marketed towards people like me, anyway.  I've tried to use it somewhat consistently for a week which is tragically short of the promoted time frame of four weeks before clearly discernible improvement in the appearance of expression lines can be anticipated but I also know my commitment is destined to diminish so I'm not going to make any claims of coming back later to update because all I would have to add is sitting on a shelf in a cabinet in the bathroom has proven to be less than optimally effective.   One thing I can state unequivocally is as it relates to the benefits proclaimed the manufacturer's test groups in the documentation after 60 seconds/15 minutes/1 hour of application, I'm unquestionably among the outliers who didn't notice any changes. In fact, as compared with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SK-II-Facial-Treatment-Essence-2-5-fl-oz/dp/B000H723LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SK-II Facial Treatment Essence, 2.5 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;I didn't really stop using to substitute this one (it's adding to the collection of over-priced unused products currently populating the vanity cabinet), at least when I did try the SK product it felt like it was doing something. This stuff has a similar feel to the after shave lotion I typically use and doesn't seem to have any efficacy like a sense of tightening or interaction. I'm not sure what the recommended amount is either, but at these prices I'm pretty sure caking it on like you're attempting to fill the crevices in window frame isn't the the best way to go.  So, all I can really say is, chances are if you apply this product as part of a structured program and don't squint, smile or frown thereafter, the probability the look of expression lines will improve is pretty strong.	-1
This product touts itself as a replacement for Botox, "needles no more", and makes some pretty bold claims of "instantly relaxes lines". I do get botox, and not even botox works "instantly" (takes about a week to set in). The thing with Botox, is that around 3 months it starts to wear off, and I schedule my appointments at about 5 months out. So I'm always looking for skin care products that might help stretch out the results or even improve the results. That said, I noticed absolutely nothing from this product. I'm not even sure, reading the ingredients, what in it would be at all effective. It has some moisturizing qualities, and also some acid peel type ingredients. That said, I already moisturize and do acid peels, so this product isn't going to magically transform my skin. The price of this is around $90 for 0.5 oz and will last you maybe 2 months. I pay $250 for Botox every 5 months. So comparatively, this costs the same as Botox, except Botox actually does something for me, and this does nothing!	-1
I've been using this religiously twice a day, morning & night, and can honestly say that I've seen no improvement. I'm 35 and have only faint crows feet. More so, I was focusing on the crease between my eyebrows. In neither area have I seen any improvement, not the faintest,  and the lines aren't even that deep.  It also appears that this product may be enlarging my pores, or so it appears between my brows. I also had an issue, for the first time, with a clogged pore under my eye on the lower lid. I wanted this to work and had high hopes after reading other online reviews but, sadly can't recommend it. Especially given the hefty price!	-1
I wanted to like the Dr. Brandt Needles No More product, and it does make a nice eye cream. However, that is not what this is being marketed for. There is a nice blend of emollients and film forming agents that produce a temporary tightening feeling - but not appearance - in the skin. The scent - a mild blend of lavender and chamomile essential oil - is subtle and did not produce any irritation. But the claims of mimicking the effects of Botox are highly exaggerated. If you think of this as an expensive eye cream, you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, stick with an anti-aging retinol product and save your money for a real Botox injection.	-1
Perhaps my wrinkles need an anti-depressant?  I've been using this on my forehead faithfully since I got it, and I don't notice any change in the appearance of my "expression lines."  It's tempting to try these things out and fortunately, I got to do that for free.  If I'd paid the price for this cream, I'd probably earn a new "expression line."	-1
I never repurchase because I learn to embrace organic which helps more better for my hair type. It is liked by others except not for me.	-1
This is one of the worst things that happened to my hair. I wet my head, towel dried it and applied Olaplex 3 from roots to ends. Waited for 30 minutes, rinsed it off and followed with my shampoo and deep hydrating conditioner. I let my hair air dry (I usually do that) and ... Before I put this stuff on I had natural waves, my hair was shiny and it did not look like an overused swab. I had some breakage, means my hair also luck protein, but since I'm also coloring my hair I blonde I thought this treatment could be nice. I witnessed how it changed my friend's hair in best possible way. But this isn't my case. Perhaps because I color with Aveda and Aveda strongly stands against Olaplex being mixed with their product. I know I didn't mix anything, but maybe it has some bad reaction with the color I have... I just hope it will rinse off... If you're planning to try it, do yourself a favor and try on a little part first. If it doesn't work for you, you won't end up with full head of disastrous hair like I did.	-1
I was truly excited to try this moisturizer. Vichy has a great reputation and I had high hopes. I have to moisturize as I get eczema if my skin gets too dry, and I jump at any chance to try a great lotion, cream, or body butter.  What I am picky about is smell and residue. I can handle light, "natural" scents, but nothing that lingers or is too perfume-y. And I prefer that my skin feel clean after, not greasy or sticky.  I tried this first on my hands and arms. It smells very strongly of perfume and the scent lasts, so make sure you like it as it will be there for a while! And it left my skin sticky. I elected to wash off and not use it any more.  Oh well. I did expect more at a $29 price point.	-1
I wanted to like this product, but I don't. It's supposed to give one firmer, smoother and more radiant skin, but for me, it made my skin uncomfortably "tight." On top of this, it is HIGHLY fragranced. I wouldn't normally mind that, but it smells strongly of roses, and not in a good way. In fact, after I had applied it, my husband walked into the bathroom and said, "Eww, what's that smell?"  I know fragrance is highly subjective and others might like it, but this was a big NO for me. I would not purchase this and would not recommend it.	-1
I love hylaronic acid.  For years I bought it separately and applied it as a serum before my facial moisturizer to excellent effect, and more recently I've found&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/bliss-Fabulous-Drench-and-Quench-Cream/dp/B016IXPWO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">bliss Fabulous Drench and Quench Cream</a>&nbsp;with hylaronic acid for my face which is absolutely luscious and penetrating and makes my skin feel the most moisturized it's ever felt.  So I was really excited to try this body balm with a hylaronic acid serum mixed in, but unlike the other products I've tried or the times when I've put hylaronic acid on my skin before a lotion, this doesn't seem to have that immediate, penetrating richness that I've grown so attached to.  This feels like a normal thick skin cream.  I have to work hard to get it to soak in and I have to apply it twice before it makes my skin feel moisturized.  I've started using a plain hylaronic acid serum before I apply this and that works like a charm, but alone this does not have the qualities that I've come to appreciate in products that include the serum.  Any cream feels better if I apply the serum first, so there's no  reason to pay extra for one with the serum in it, if the effects of the serum aren't really noticeable when I use it.  Also, it has a strange smell, almost like the smell of rotting roses... it goes away quickly, but it's very noticeable when I first apply it.  PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.)	-1
IMAGE Skincare Clear Cell Medicated Acne Masque is more like an exfoliant; its gritty texture was surprising.  The light grayish-tan cream smelled like leather balm.  The directions tell you to leave it on for 5 - 10 minutes, but the masque burned so badly I removed it after only one minute.  My skin did feel smooth and there was no lasting irritation.  However, I would not recommend this product, particularly for those having sensitive skin.	-1
The item may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.	-1
I already spend a good amount on makeup because I am white with lots of natural blush with a tinge of European yellow to my skin.  With the rave reviews I had really high hopes for this brand. I was SO disappointed.  The color was super light, it didn't do a good job covering the extra natural blush my face has; it was hard to get it to conceal anything. It was light and airy, which is nice.  But honestly? For this price, go and get yourself COLOR matched at a Lancome counter.  I already use their Dual Finish mineral in Matte Ecru II... and I put each makeup on half of my face. The CHEAPER Lancome totally outdid the other... with my Kabuki brush, I got a nice, light and airy finish with that and it actually MATCHED my face and smoothed out the imperfections.  Now, that being said, if you happen to get this and it matches you perfectly, then great!  It's a nice makeup, and applied it looks very similar to the very high quality Lancome.  But then you have to deal with the "fresh grind" mess. And it's a mess.  I was super annoyed by it sending powder everywhere; and then you have the added step of having to blend it before applying it. I think it's just a fad and people may be "oohed" by it, but it's really just an added step and a pain!  One last thing; there is a little disc in a separate little bag. Don't toss.. it's your face mask!  I didn't know what to do with it, but I moistened it thinking I would rub it on my skin but it unfolded (albeit a bit painfully) to a large mask that fit my face perfectly.  It really refreshed my skin and made it feel lovely and tingly.  But it's one time use only; so that's not so hot.  So my suggestion? If you like this, go for Lancome instead and get color matched; their dual finish is super similar in how it looks on and skips the annoying grinding step.  And I do believe it was actually cheaper as well!!  I use their liquid under sometimes as well, with a touch of the powder on top for when I want more coverage; otherwise I just use the mineral to make me look like I have awesome skin without any makeup on!	-1
Returned it. Did not like how it went on or blended. Bare Minerals primer is better for me.	-1
A rare miss from La Roche-Posay. It has a fluffy, souffle like texture, and it blended on my skin nicely, providing a good amount of coverage. However, as the day progressed my skin began to feel like an oil slick. The product also seemed accentuated my pores and fine lines as the day went on. I have oily, acne prone skin, so this might work better for someone with drier skin.	-1
I wanted to love this! I did, I truly did. Felt great, skin looks amazing but it did not stay put! I took a nap on the couch with this on and it got everywhere! SO sad. Sent it back. Search continues . . . sigh.	-1
Feels silky but looked like pancake makeup on me; also extremely light in color (I'm very fair, but this was white-ish).  Love the Effaclar line, but this one was a total bust.	-1
The texture of the cream mousse made it hard for the product to spread evenly on my skin- which is combination. It was almost too thick and dry, but it might work better on oilier complexions. The coverage overall wasn't great, and didn't really blur the look of my pores either. While it wasn't a great BB cream for me, I did find that it works surprisingly well as a primer.	-1
the bottle started oxidizing. it was gross	-1
It feels greasy, made my face shiny and caused my skin to break out. It also had that unpleasant 'sunscreen smell' when I applied it (though the smell does fade). It seemed effective as a sunscreen, has a very high SPF - but I would not recommend it for folks like myself with sensitive or oily skin. Also, it's not good for use on eye area; if I sweat a little or my eyes water, it gets into my eyes and burns. Really painful.	-1
This seems kind of a misleading product. It talks about it being some kind of serum - made it seem really fancy but it is really just an expensive sunscreen. Looking at the ingredients, there are no antioxidants but plenty of sunscreen products in here. Well, I decided to give it a try anyway.  This came with the product already out of the box and the cap off. It seem to have came out of the packaging during transit. It took a few pumps and then the product came out. It is extremely thin and I did not care for the smell. It irritated my nostrils and I will not be using it again.	-1
I believe this product is a little misleading in its claim to minimize puffiness and dark circles. I have not seen that result when I used as directed (just a small drop) I did find that it soothed dry under eye skin so if your under eye problem is mostly due to that then this might be a little more helpful than it was for me.	-1
Is it a good pillowcase? yes, its super soft and lovely to sleep on ....except it smells like copper a bit and after awhile it felt rough. I have been sleeping on this for a week and I do not feel more refreshed, or wrinkle free, or rejuvinated. Maybe in time this will happen but I am impatient.	-1
This product arrived this afternoon. I eagerly removed it for the box and began to pump away ... totally excited to try this new serum. After many, many pumps, nothing happened. I took the top off and instantly noticed that the "straw" that connects to the pump was missing. This explains why no amount of pumping would result in any product. I found a pack of chopsticks in our junk drawer and gave the contents a little prod ... hoping to locate and reconnect that "straw" type device. There was nothing in the bottle except for the serum ... with no way to get it out. (It is so thick that my shaking it, tapping it, and even slamming it against my palm resulted in very little coming out).  From what I can deduce, the smell is REALLY nice, and it seems to have a lovely shimmer, but woe betide the person who gets a bottle similar to mine. Does it work? I have no idea. I cannot even get it out of the bottle. What a weird quality-control issue. If I can locate any way to get this out of the bottle without contaminating it, I will update this review.	-1
I used bliss Triple Oxygen Radiant Protection Serum for about a week and while I didn't notice any visible results to my fine lines, I did start to experience breakouts. I have not tried the product again to confirm that the bliss serum was indeed the culprit of the sudden breakout but since discontinuing use of the product my skin has returned to normal. Perhaps I'm sensitive to one of the numerous ingredients this serum contains because II don't typically have problem skin.  I'm a little suspicious of whatever makes this serum look so orange and shimmery.  The serum has a faint orange fragrance, which is not unpleasant, and it felt okay when applied to my skin, but it practically glows when it's dispensed from the pump. I'm not sure why the manufacturer included all the color and shimmer because the product goes on as if it's translucent.  It may be a fabulous product for others but it did not work well for me.	-1
I have very light skin, but I could not apply enough of this product to show.  It just didn't have any color to it.  I like very much that it is not tested on animals, it's in a nice case and packaged well.  I  applied about three coats, but it just doesn't work for me.	-1
I don't see what the big deal is about this lotion. It really doesn't smell or feel any nicer than something that could be purchased at a drug store. The ingredients are also very basic and nothing to get excited about. The scent is mediocre at best. This is more of a perfumed lotion than a moisturizing one. I could look past that fact if this actually smelled good. It really does not.  I don't know what the whole "sparkling" thing in the description is supposed to mean. This is not a shimmering lotion. The price on this should really be $4.50 instead of $45.00. If you want to try some wonderful, but still affordable luxury skincare, go with L'occitane and Perlier.	-1
This hair gel does what it promises in that it won't make hair crunchy. However, it also fails to hold a style to any significant degree. We gave it a good-faith effort for about a month with my son's hair and decided that it simply doesn't work to maintain his pretty simple styling either. Not much else really needs to be mentioned in a review of this unfortunately.	-1
My husband often uses a hair gel to keep his hair in place and  to keep it looking neat. His hair isn't very long, just enough to get messed up. He is always willing to try different hair products and thought this might be a good one. He was mostly disappointed with this one, mainly because it didn't do a good job of holding his hair. The scent was kind of citrusy and a little strong, but that would have been okay because it disappates rather quickly. I thought it smelled pretty good. But in order to get this gel to hold his hair he had to use a lot, enough that it gunked up his hair and made it feel dirty. So we really can't recommend this one.  The company apparently made another gel prior to this that people liked. It sounds like they should have stuck with the old formula. All too often companies try to improve on a popular product and change some of the very things that made it popular for ingredients that don't perform as well.	-1
My husband actually laughed when he used this gel. He couldn't figure out what it was for, since it apparently didn't do a thing. His hair after application was like he had just washed it with baby shampoo: super soft and with zero control.  If you are looking for a hair gel, keep looking. This isn't worth the tube it's packaged in.	-1
No hold. I don't know what Jack Black is thinking with their "Max Hold" products, as they all seem to be more like "a little bit of hold", whereas their "strong hold" products are pretty sturdy.  I mean there's not much else to say. I used more than should be necessary, and I could barely tell I had anything in my hair. The level of hold is almost nonexistant. Even with very short hair and a large amount of product, this did absolutely nothing to hold my hair in place. It's about as much help as rubbing lotion into your hair- sure that'll weigh down the follicles a bit, but that's all you're getting.  But, there's nothing offensive about the product. It smells fine and it doesn't harm my hair. The finish is good. So I can't take all points off, but close to it.	-1
Ok, so if you are looking to help keep from getting stretch marks or even to reduce them, this cream will not help with those results. It is a nice cream. It goes on easy and non greasy. A few others mention a scent. I did not have any issues with the scent. Again, however, that was not why I was looking forward to this cream. Don't waste your money for no results.	-1
My doctor said that nothing can prevent stretch marks and that it is genetics. "If your mother had stretchmarks or your fathers mother then you are more likely to have them and the elasticity of your skin"  With that being said I still gave it a try and I ended up having to wipe it off as it has a pretty strong floral smell. I did not find it to be similar to any other mustela product I have used and was left gagging.	-1
The fragrance on this conditioner was so incredibly strong that it literally made me gag. I was really looking forward to trying this, because it's a brand with a great reputation, and the texture was thick and looked highly moisturizing. However, I'm very sensitive to overly strong fragrances, and both the fragrance itself and the sheer overwhelming quality of it made it so I didn't even want to put this on my hair. I really wish companies would make it clearer if they are going to use this quantity of fragrance in their product. I use a wide variety of hair products in my very long hair, and many of them, indeed most of them, do have some level of fragrance, but this is way over the top.	-1

Really disappointed. Two hairdressers RAVED about Oribe, as if it was the best brand ever. I'm unimpressed. First of all, I bought it quickly, thinking I bought shampoo. It was bad enough as shampoo - i.e., I was disappointed that it didn't leave my hair soft and it really didn't brighten it. And, since I have super curly hair, I frequently use conditioner to wash my hair. When I realized this was conditioner, I was more than disappointed. Talk about drying out my hair!  What a waste of money.  The smell is ok, a bit too perfumey for me. I specifically purchased it for use with keratin treated hair. While this claims to be safe for keratin, the second time I used it I noticed that my hair was starting to get frizzy. I found this to be really upsetting as I'm only 6 weeks into a keratin treatment, and it's winter, and keratin usually lasts me easily 3 months through a steamy summer. I can't say for sure that this was the cause, as each keratin treatment and product is different, and I've had 3 different keratin products over the past 9 months. Frankly, even if this worked really well, the price is outrageously absurd and I've had better luck with drugstore purple shampoos and conditioners. No more Oribe for me.	-1
made me breakout	-1
This polish is terrible. It's not the problem of the polish itself since I already owned several, there is a problem with the way it is stored. It's way too thick and too gloopy for a fresh Butter London nail polish. Butter London polishes are famous for being thin and easy to layer. Layering the second coat on top of the first one isn't an easy task for the polish I've got. Very disappointed I can't send it back. Had to order a new one directly from the brand. Waste of money and time.	-1
Expensive for such streaky coverage. Beautiful colors  but I won't purchase again	-1

This has a decent fresh scent and a light suds but it is loaded with chemical ingredients and it dries out the skin.	-1
Awful product. I've used their fibers with great success, but this stuff is useless. All it does is make your hair look dull and straw like. I contacted the company and asked for a refund, but did not get the courtesy of a response. Sorry I bought this product. Does not do what it purports to do.	-1
Terrible product. Doesn't hide any thin spots--only makes your hair feel like straw and look dull.	-1
I bought this product (in another color), followed the directions exactly, but this does nothing but cause your existing hair to turn an off share and feel like straw. Unlike the Toppik fibers, this doesn't do anything for areas of thinning. I contacted the company and asked for a refund, but didn't even get the courtesy of a response. Toppik fibers are good, but this product is useless.	-1
Can not return tb i s item!!! I don't know what people are talking about I agree with all the negative reviews this product doesn't nothing for you. This does not add volume to hair! It's like hair dye in a can. The nosel does not spray out good at all, it's messy and gets all over you and all over the place, and again it's a liquid. Ive seen better hair colors for Halloween than this. This is not as described. I would return it but you cannot return this product because it's flammable do not purchase!	-1
Made my hair look dirty and filmy.  Not very attractive on	-1
When I opened the cap, the entire bullet came out with it. I was able to put it back in the crayon, but it smeared some as the product is very soft, so it doesn't look great anymore (and for the price, that's annoying). Normally, Japonesque is a trusted brand for me, so I'm not sure what happened here.  As for the color correcting, yeah, it works well with fingers or a brush to conceal redness, but it didn't work any better than my concealer alone. Also, it's expensive for what feels like cheap packaging. I'd reccomend trying a drugstore color corrector before buying this one.	-1
I believe it was fake. Left my scalp itchy and inflamed	-1
I'm going to go through this point by point because I really wanted to like this product but found it lacking in several areas.  First, the applicator. You push up on a "button" at the bottom to get the product onto the brush. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - as in you get nothing, or you get too much, or if you're lucky it's just right.''  Second, the color. It looks much darker than it is, and once applied it gives a *tiny* bit of shimmer if you use enough, but not much more than that. Additionally, when I put it on over my makeup, it basically 'washed' my makeup off. When I tried to put it on first and then put makeup over it (both options are suggested on the product's box, by the way), my makeup, which is very light in terms of coverage, hid what little "illumination" this product offered.  Third, I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that it made their skin feel tight. It wasn't the most unpleasant sensation ever, but it also isn't the way I want my skin to feel after applying a product that is supposed to soothe it.	-1
I tried this product a couple of times, each time I put it on over my makeup, but I have to say that it didn't illuminate my skin as expected, I honestly could not see the difference to my skin after applying it other than it added a different color to my skin. It was easy to apply (it looks like a pearly lotion) it comes out through the small brush after you press on the end of the applicator, and even though you're suppose to use the brush to distribute it, I also ended up using my fingers to smooth it into my skin. I noticed that the color actually looked a little bit lighter on my face once applied (I'm a brunette and I had the nor color).  Additionally, after applying it, my skin didn't feel any softer, if anything, it felt a little tight. I honestly don't think it's worth the price and I would not recommend it.	-1
I honestly dislike this product for two main reasons:  1. The spray goes everywhere, it's much too fine of a spray, so you truly can't use it inside. Using it outside means you have to have clothes on, which means you can't get the spray everywhere without getting it on your clothes. Frustrating.  2. I didn't see any significant results, possibly because I am using it outside and there isn't enough product getting on my skin, as I don't want it to get on my clothing. Would loved to have had this work, but sadly I'm very disappointed in it.	-1
Several things I didn't enjoy, very fragrant.  The lotion was very fragrant and also had an odd taste, yes taste, I could taste it even though it was only on my face.  And I do have a husband who also kisses me, he said it was perfumey and kind of a turn off.  The lotion also dried my skin out.  At first I thought, this lotion is new, I'll just give it time. I had already been using the serum for awhile, so I was surprised at how dry my skin got. By day five my skin was red and itchy and very visibly dry.  I gave it a few days off, and tried again, the same thing happened.  This is not a lotion for me.  I have mildly sensitive skin, oily in the T-zone, and dry everywhere else, my skin is neither mature or very young, it's in it's 30s.  I used as directed, with other Vichy products I had already been using.  This lotion was not for me.  Perhaps others will have more luck.	-1
The interesting thing about this product is that so many of its pros also wind up being cons.  For example: the texture of the cream is very light - some have called it almost gel-like, and I'd agree with that.  That lightness makes it easy to smooth on the face.  The downside to that: it's so light that it doesn't impart much moisture at all.  This would be great for someone who doesn't have particularly dry skin, but for those of us who need a big dose of moisture, this doesn't work for that.  For those who benefit from light moisturization, be prepared for how this product gives you that: in my experience, after it's smoothed on, it leaves a lightly tacky, even greasy feel to the skin.  The scent has gotten a lot of mentions in reviews, and there is a reason for that.  I thought it would be fine for me even though I'm very sensitive to strong aromas because "parfum/fragrance" is the last item on the ingredient list.  Initially, it seems to have a lovely, light rose scent.  However, that scent doesn't dissipate at all - it just sits there on your face, and for me, it became cloying and eventually overwhelming.  By the time I'd had it on for about a half hour, I'd begun to develop a headache and had to wash it off.  (Side note: it didn't come off easily at all with just water; this is the kind of product that requires some kind of cleanser to totally remove.)  The packaging is nice, in terms of the inside of the box having diagrams and instructions for application of the product, and the jar is quite pretty with a useful mirror serving as the top of the lid.  The downside here, though, is that this obviously requires you to dip your fingers into the product in order to then apply it to your face; as such, even with clean hands, eventually bacteria could start to be a concern, so I would have preferred if the cream had come in a pump-form.  The aspects of the product that don't have "cons" - it's paraben free, and even though my skin is highly sensitive, I didn't experience any irritation when I put this on my face.  (However, it is worth noting again that I could only tolerate having it on my skin for a half hour because of the fragrance.)  It's been so difficult - actually it's been impossible, thus far - for me to find a moisturizer/cream that won't irritate my sensitive skin and won't make my extreme sensitivity to fragrance come into play.  This product will likely work for people who don't have to deal with those things and don't require a product that delivers a lot of moisture.  For all of those like me who are on a quest for an effective, non-irritating, non-aggravating moisturizer, the search continues.	-1
I have sensitive skin and a sensitive nose. I was not able to use this product because the smell irritates my sinuses. I was not expecting this because other reviewers had written that the scent was light and pleasant. Since my skin is sensitive, I tested this product on the skin of my arm, planning to leave it on overnight to watch for any irritation. Unfortunately, fumes rose into my nose immediately and I felt a headache coming so I rinsed my arm off. Then I went to bed, but had trouble going to sleep because I could still smell it and my sinuses felt very irritated.  This seemed odd because the smell seemed flowery, like roses, and should have been pleasant. I don't know why it bothered me so strongly. But I would not dare put this on my face!  On the plus side, the formula is paraben-free. And many people seem to like it. However, it also contains a list of chemicals, some of them questionable. Here's the list from the manufacturer's site: AQUA / WATER  GLYCERIN  ALCOHOL DENAT.  PRUNUS ARMENIACA KERNEL OIL / APRICOT KERNEL OIL  ISONONYL ISONONANOATE  POLYSORBATE 20  NIACINAMIDE  DIMETHICONE  PROPANEDIOL  ISOPROPYL LAUROYL SARCOSINATE  PEG-20 METHYL GLUCOSE SESQUISTEARATE  AMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE  BHT  C13-14 ISOPARAFFIN  CI 17200 / RED 33  CI 15985 / YELLOW 6  TRIETHANOLAMINE  CAFFEINE  SODIUM HYALURONATE  PHENOXYETHANOL  ADENOSINE  TOCOPHERYL ACETATE  DISODIUM EDTA  DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE  CAPRYLOYL SALICYLIC ACID  CAPRYLYL GLYCOL  LAURETH-7  HYDROXYPALMITOYL SPHINGANINE  XANTHAN GUM  POLYACRYLAMIDE  ACRYLONITRILE/METHYL METHACRYLATE/VINYLIDENE CHLORIDE COPOLYMER  PARFUM / FRAGRANCE  FIL 688810 10  BHT is Butylated hydroxytoluene, a controversial ingredient. It's generally derived from petroleum. The MSDS says "Hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of inhalation (lung irritant)." That applies to using it full-strength, which is not the case in this formula.  Other questionable ingredients include denatured alcohol and polyacrylamide.  I hope this is helpful to somebody.	-1
This smells very nice, but it doesn't work that well as a conditioner. I left it in for 4-5 minutes and combed it through with a shower comb. The first thing I really noticed besides the fact that it felt kinda "dry" was that my hair tended to tangle more and it was difficult to comb through my hair. I have baby fine hair that I pamper and I never dye it or use a hair dryer on it. It is in pretty good condition because of the way I treat it. After my hair dried, I noticed that there wasn't much shine and that I had more fly away hair than usual.  I would not recommend this conditioner	-1
I had really high expectations for this product, as I have heard lots of raves for the Obagi skincare line.  I used this product twice a day, every day (per the instructions) for 4 weeks but have seen no improvement.  In fact, it made my skin drier.  I now have these dry patches on either side of my mouth which is beginning to clear up now that I've decided to stop using this product.  To be clear, it did not brighten my skin or in any way improve its appearance.  I have medium skin which is prone to hyperpigmentation.  I applied on areas with dark spots which did not lighten at all.  I have a feeling that for this product to be effective, it has to be used with the entire line.  A little goes a long way so apply carefully. The smell is unpleasant to me - what I would characterize as "yeasty" but it does go away after a few minutes.  One thing to note is that you must be religious about sunscreen.  I used sunscreen in the morning but forgot to put it on in the afternoon before my one-hour walk.  I noticed that my skin was red/sunburnt later that day.  And I don't usually burn.  This product does make your skin more sensitive to the sun so don't forget to protect it!	-1
The smell of this blend is awful. It dissipates fairly quickly but really is unpleasant. I used the product twice a day on the back of one hand for two weeks and I have seen no difference. This is a smooth cream that is not greasy or oily but oh the smell!	-1
I usually love Jane Iredale, but this blush is a disappointment.  I know the picture shows the tube, but it is REALLY small, 3" tall with only 2" of product inside.  I thought I had misordered and got lipstick at first.  The color is nice, goes on very nice, but SMELLS.  I think they made it smell like chocolate - yuck.  Seriously, when is the last time any woman put chocolate on her face? I buy Jane Iredale because of the superior quality, quantity and non allergic smells, etc.  This one failed on all three.  So, if you would like to smell like chocolate, buy this blush.	-1
The color was not at all what I expected. It's VERY PINK, and not in a natural way. The color shown here looks very natural, a pachy-pink color and perfect for my fair peaches-n-cream skin color. Sadly to say, it is so pink that I cannot use it. I'll find someone to give it to. Not for me	-1
First Baxter product I am not a fan of.  For my hair it does NOTHING.  It goes in pleasantly and has a nice odor that lasts about as long as it will take you to get dressed.  My hair is fairly short and truthfully I don't get the purpose of the product as it does not hold my hair in place at all.  Maybe someone with longer hair would find a better use by ridding  themselves of curls, but as for me, the slight friz i do get this product is not worth the money.	-1

Gentlemen, if your stylist reaches for this stuff- RUN! It's left me with the most horrid smelling hair, like someone dumped a bottle of old lady perfume on me. It is way too strong and fragrant, very feminine too. It's lasted for days now even after I shampoo. Holy hell.	-1
Does not work.  But smells good.	-1
I wear mineral sunscreen on my face daily. I've worn everything from professionally compounded mineral sunscreens to over-the-counter product.  Unfortunately, this TIZO 2 Non-Tinted Mineral Sunscreen caused problems for me than it solved.  PRO 1) It's a mineral-based sunscreen.  CONS 1) Once on my skin, the lotion felt oily and dry.  It stayed that way until removed with soap and water.(I have sensitive, *dry* skin, and it made my face feel oily to the touch.) 2) It feels cakey and oily when worn with face powder or makeup. 3) If you have oily skin or sensitive skin, it may not be the choice for you. 4) It seemed to take a lot of product to achieve full coverage of my face and neck.  Having worn mineral sunscreens ALL of my adult life, I just cannot recommend the formula of this product.	-1
I have very fair skin. Tanning is not an option (who wants to take that risk?!). So, I rely on self-tanners to make me a little less translucent/glow-in-the-dark white in the summer months. Now, for me, this product didn't really provide that sun-kissed look I was seeking. The color was just ... off. I also found it difficult to use the product since the contents are clear; therefore, it was difficult to feel assured that the results would be consistent.  Now, as with all tanners, do exfoliate before using this. I like a sea-salt scrub ... but I know some people who like a sugar-scrub. Both have the same general results (but, for me, most sugar scrubs have a slick finish that conflicts with the tanning lotion). Exfoliating should prevent some of the dark patches that some folks are experiencing.  The scent is okay and the mitt is a really nice touch.  If I had to speculate, this might be better for those with a darker complexion. On those with fair skin, the results are a little strange.	-1
Did not care for the over all results of this product. The first thing I noticed was the smell which was quite pleasant so that was a good start. Application was fairly easy to apply to my skin so good there. But once it was all applied it did not give a nice brown tan look it was a more of a medium orange/tan which I did not like at all and as time went by it just got worse. I thought maybe I applied it wrong but I rechecked the instructions a few times and no it was not that. Maybe it was just my skin pigmentation and the product did not mix but either way it was a bust for me.	-1
This brand of tanning lotion did not work for me.  The application was easy as all you really have to do is rub it in evenly, but the color was all wrong.  My skin turned out to be too orangy/brown.  It didn't look natural at all. I tried to apply it a second time thinking I had just used too much, but nope it wasn't my application. This lotion just has too much color in it for my skin.  It might look great on darker skin tones, but for med/light ones I would shy away.  The one positive I could find was that this one didn't smell horrible. Several other brands I have chosen smell really bad, but this one does have a nicer fragrance than most.  I have found that self tanners are totally subjective because everyones skin tone is different so this might work for you, just be careful is all I am saying.	-1
Before we get into the review, I'll start with my disclaimer. I loathe the name "XEN-TAN." I can't tell you specifically WHY I have a negative association with it, but the tongue twister just doesn't sound appealing to me. Here is the definition that I looked up for "xen": 1 a :  guest :  foreigner <xenophobia> b :  that which is not the host <xenograft>  2 a :  strange :  foreign <xenolith> b :  not being the host <xenobiotic>  Weird, huh? Anyway, I think the creative geniuses behind the product probably thought xen meant Zen and mixed up big time.  BTW, Zen means: "An approach to religion, arising from Buddhism that seeks religious enlightenment by meditation in which there is no consciousness of self."  Think of Zen as "peaceful and relaxed."  Now that we got my opinion on the name straight, here's my evaluation of the product. THUMBS UP: 1. If only reviewing the application mitt, I'd easily give it 5 stars. The texture, weight and the way it applies the product is unsurpassed. 2. Love the smell. I can't detect a hint of "grapefruit" as specified on the bottle, but the aroma is light, airy and natural. 3. Nice, foamy texture. 4. Easy to apply; use circular motions, as the manufacturers recommend, this way is the best way to apply the product for even absorption. 5. Absorbs lickety-split. 6. Feels light on the skin. 7. Doesn't stain clothes. 8. Though it didn't give me the results I sought (see THUMBS DOWN, 1 and 2 below), it worked better than other tanners I have tried without the dreadful streaking.  THUMBS DOWN: 1. Unfortunately, it didn't give me the tan I desired. At first, my legs and arms looked pretty good, but then I noticed after a couple of weeks of application, my arms started to look very uneven and were freckled in appearance. NO GOOD. 2. The product never worked on my face.  THE NITTY-GRITTY: Perhaps XEN-TAN works better on people with darker skin. I am super fair and freckled. For me, this is not an advantageous beauty product. I should have figured as much when the name itself scared me off.	-1
If you have very sensitive skin, pass this product by. I'm 52-years-old and this tanning cream caused my face to break out in acne.  I have an auto-immune disease that prevents me from being able to spend much time in the sun without covering up. I am as white as white can be, so I thought I would try this to give myself a little color. It does work. It gave me color, but after a day or two it leaned towards the orange side on me and I don't particularly want to look like Donald Trump. Luckily, I was able to wash most of it off by washing my face several times and then moisturizing.  If you don't have sensitive skin, and if, like Trump, you don't mind having a face that is orange, then this is for you. If not, embrace your whiteness as I plan to do.	-1
I didn't like this product much and it didn't bronze my face with a natural look. I was a bit wary of trying this product because of my past experience with self tanners and unfortunately this product didn't change my opinion of them.	-1
Coverage seems good but the product left my skin feeling oily. After using it for two days my face broke out so I stopped using it.	-1
Not happy with this - and it's the condition it arrived in that's the problem.  The highlighter was all broken up and it was impossible to put it back together in a cake so that it could be used with a brush or a sponge.  It was certainly packed well, in a double box with no signs of rough handling, so it must have been through something really wild to have arrived in this condition.  Too bad, because I was looking forward to seeing the effect.	-1
I was expecting some really great bubble baths due to the price and all the Dead Sea marketing. Unfortunately,  this stuff is just not that great. The hibiscus smells like Jolly Rancher candy; the milk &  honey is pretty subtle; the lavender smells vaguely of it, but more like a generic purple smell.  Thr bubbles are  not plentiful and dissipate too soon.  And it certainly does not moisturize as it claims to. Check out the very long ingredients list.	-1
As others have mentioned, these products have two things going for them: one, this company does not test on animals, which is wonderful; and two, they won't irritate sensitive skin.  As for that claim, my skin is super- (I'd even say ridiculously) sensitive, but after using all three of these multiple times, I didn't break out at all or suffer any kind of negative reaction.  Unfortunately, that's pretty much where the positives ended, in my experience, as they wound up being quite disappointing.  Upon opening the bottles, I was pleased with the scents, with the lavender being the most intense and the milk & honey being the lightest and warmest fragrance.  Those fragrances don't last long at all, which could be a positive or a negative depending on what you're looking for.  For me, I was expecting something that would impart a little bit of a lasting fragrance on my skin, but the scent rinsed away almost completely and the teeny tiny little bit that was left after stepping out of the shower dissipated extremely quickly.  If you're looking for something with a rich lather, these products won't deliver that.  I wing up having to use a good amount of product on my shower poof before I can get anything even remotely resembling a lather, and even then, it feels like that large amount of product still didn't even last long enough to cover my body, with the lather being negligible, at best.  (Note: I haven't had a chance to use them in a bubble bath, but given my experience, it doesn't surprise me at all that other reviewers say that the bubble situation these yield leaves a lot to be desired.)  As far as moisturization goes, well, there wasn't any.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that the minute I step out of the shower after using these, any patches of even remotely dry skin I have immediately being to itch, and the rest of my skin doesn't feel moisturized at all.  So these smell great in the bottles, don't irritate sensitive skin, and aren't tested on animals.  However, they don't actually fulfill their claims or do much of anything at all.  In fact, you could go to the drugstore and pick up any number of gels/washes and find things that smell good, lather well, impart a ton of moisture, and cost less than these.  The bottom line for me is that my expectations for these were high, but they were ultimately disappointing.	-1
I've had good luck with Bioderma products in the past, so my expectations were pretty high for this. Unfortunately, something in it just doesn't do good things to or for my skin - it didn't seem to impart any moisture at all or otherwise help with dry skin, and every time that I've used it (and I've used it many times at this point, always hoping for a different result) I've gotten irritations on my skin (itchy places, redness, etc.). Plus - and this surprised me - the scent is quite strong/heavily perfumed.  Many other reviewers seem to like this product a lot, but while I wish that I had better things to say about it, it's just not something that works for me.	-1
after I used it 3 weeks my skin has no improvement still dry I don't think this product make a difference	-1
NUXE is a French brand. I buy and use several NUXE products (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NUXE-Contour-des-Yeux-Prodigieux-Anti-Fatigue-Moisturizing-Eye-Cream-0-5-fl-oz/dp/B000E1EWT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NUXE Contour des Yeux Prodigieux Anti-Fatigue Moisturizing Eye Cream, 0.5 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;which I love) but this one is not for me.  This is a fragrant anti-aging mask. I just turned the cap to on and rolled on a thin film of clear "serum" on my face and neck, waited 10 minutes, and removed it. My face smelled great because the product is fragrant and my skin felt soft but not plump as specified. Personally, I prefer exfoliating masks to this type. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this but it was not for me.  One big negative is that it is hard to find the English instructions on the tube and box (both inside and out). The best instructions are on the inside of the box.   If I were the type that preferred a super light mask that feels almost not there and has no exfoliating properties, then I would have rated this 4 stars.	-1
This Nuxe luxuriance mask smells amazing. And the packaging is amazingly fun, it's got an on/off swivel top under neath the pull cap, and a easy spinning metal tip applicator. Unfortunately, that's about as far as my love goes. It's not thick like a typical mask, but thin and more fluid like a serum. In fact it's so thin that after turning the tube off and using the cooling metal tip to massage the mask into my skin per the instructions I don't feel like I really have any mask left on, it's all been massaged into my skin. Which makes step 3, wiping with a cotton round feel unnecessary. While my skin is soft after using, I wouldn't say it was more plump. And I wouldn't say it was softer than it was. If this was a leave on serum underneath a moisturizer I might be more inclined to purchase with the really high price tag. But, since it's a mask, meant to be removed, it's too much for too little. This is one Nuxe thats a miss for me.	-1
This product has a nice smell and applies on gently.  But it's supposed to exfoliate and make my skin softer after a winter in sweaters.  After several uses between me and my son, we didn't notice any changes.  I felt like using my loofah afterwards.  My son says it makes a good body wash.  Now for the price:  Holy moolah!  $47 bucks?  I double checked several times to see if quantity "1" included a four-pack.  No, it is only one and it is way overpriced.  If it was $8 at most, I would have given it four stars.	-1
I had high expectations of this set, but found the colors difficult to pick up on brushes and difficult to blend. Not the one for me.	-1
I guess i read it wrong ----  said "cleansing" --- i thought this was shampoo.  it's more like a conditioner.  I love the other Oribe products, but very disappointed with this.  For conditioner, i like the "dark green tube".  I gave it 2 stars for being "vague" in the description.	-1
Okay, so.  No tan here.  Long story: For one, I did everything it said. I already had a slight base tan despite using sunscreen. I shaved first, exfoliated to death, and applied exactly as it said, in circular motions.  But then, down the bottle, it says, "Shower in 48 hours to reveal your beautiful tan". What? I have to wait 48 hours to shower? Ick?!?!?!?  So I waited two hours instead, making sure to get it off my hands as those looked pretty silly. I also went a little crazy when first applying, deciding to "self tan" my whitest of parts (namely what you don't see in a bikini). I thought it would be a treat to NOT have a snow white stomach.  It did nothing except accentuate stretch marks from three pregnancies. Really!  They looked MORE noticeable and they are old stretch marks.  Sigh.  I took my shower, dried off, and then applied my favorite moisturizer.  My skin did look good but I think it was all the other steps and not so much the self-tanner. Maybe in 48 hours I'll suddenly be tan?  It's a messy mousse too. Hard to control application.  And if, by chance, your hair is wet and drips on it, you get a watermark. Like a long tear. Which is how I felt after.  I know this is high end stuff, but I see no difference between this and Jergens or those store brands that are cheap.	-1
After the mousse disaster, I'm not impressed with this. I tried this first. It wants you to leave it on a long time and then shower. It's applied the same as the mousse, and while it is a bit easier to apply than the mousse, it's all the same.  Exfoliate, scrub, apply with mitt, clean up mess, stand back naked and wait to tan.  I've tried three of their products and don't get why they are so high priced. I see nothing that knocks me out.  Lancome has a self-tanner that works better.  One positive is I didn't turn orange. I didn't turn anything.	-1
Matte color isn't great	-1
It does take off a lot of the makeup but not nearly well enough to only use this. I had a full face on when I used this. I decided I wanted to see how much it actually got off. I used a face wipe and there was still plenty of makeup left. I washed my face on top of that just to be on the safe side. I use this when I have no wipes, which comes in handy. But I still always was my face after.	-1
Where else can you get a furry washcloth that will leave fuzz all over your face? Nope. Do not get this. You would do better with plain cotton muslin cloths you can buy on here in a 10-pack that are MUCH cheaper and way more effective. I hate this thing. The size is awkward, it doesn't get off mascara (of ANY type) or eyeliner, and despite washing it per the instructions, it fuzzed me all over my face. Blech. Save yo' money, honey.	-1
Yes this worked, but you really have to pull and scrub at your skin. Which causes wrinkles. I set it aside and will only use it in a pinch if I run out of makeup remover.	-1
It is very drying, and that is the only difference I see in my skin texture since using this.	-1
I really wanted to like this product, but at the end of the day I couldn't use it. While it wasn't harsh as some similar ones are, something about putting it on and then following up with my regular moisturizer caused the combination of the two to pill together. Every time I touched my face I always came away with a roll of white stuff. Yuck!	-1
The anti-acne ingredient in Vichy Normaderm Beautifying lotion is 1.5% salicylic acid. I generally use a product with 2% concentration, so I didn't expect this lotion to be so drying. My skin began flaking and peeling after one use - and that's not all that unusual with a new anti-acne lotion, but even spacing out applications, after more than a week it's not any better. I'm going back to my higher concentration, but somehow gentler, regular product.	-1
I would classify this color palette as on the bold side.  It is advertised as pixilated.  It definitely leans toward dark/sparkly.  Out of the box I took an immediate dislike to the product.  It arrived in its black Japonesque box, but there were no plastic seals at all.  No shrink-wrap, no plastic over the makeup, no plastic overlay, etc.  I have to knock it down 2 stars just because of that.  There also is nothing at all in the way of an applicator.  Now, for decent/better makeup that is not uncommon, but just a note to anyone who is buying this expecting an included applicator.  In total, there 10 colors, totaling 16.4 grams.  The color palette itself is varied as far as color options.  There are four Pro Basic colors and four Pixelated (sparkly) colors:  Medium flesh tone  Lighter flesh tone  Cocoa flesh tone  Black  Pixelated silver  Plxelated turquoise  Plxelated lavender  Pixelated gray  Plxelated bronze  Pixelated purple  Obviously the pixilated colors have a good deal of sheen/glitter properties to them.  The Pro Basic colors are more matte, but have some shimmer to them.  They go on nicely and are excellent for transition between colors.  If you like a more prominent, bold shadow look, you probably will like working with the pixilated colors.  This is definitely more of a weekend kit than a business/work day eye shadow set.  The colors all apply nicely, but like anything strong or bold, less is more and a little goes a long way.  I see the pixilated shades as more accent colors than the base.  This is a decent set, but I could see younger people or those who go bold preferring it over someone looking for a more subtle look.  Probably a 4 start product, but eye shadow with no plastic seal?  2 stars.	-1
This sounds very nice and the packaging looks elegant, but I had a really difficult time with it...  It stuck to my face and I could barely get it off. I used it in the morning before work and had to scrub like mad with a washcloth. I could still feel it on my face when I took my evening shower. After I scrubbed my face trying to get it off, my face burned. Not a good experience for me.	-1
Kind of disappointed.  The other good reviews and product experience with Jack Black prompted the purchase.  But I am not impressed at all by the scent--almost like a cheap detergent smell.  It is light, at first, almost Davidoff White Water like smell.  But it fades away quickly and it takes quite a few sprays to get anything lasting.  It is Body Spray so I am not expecting the strength of a Eau De Toilette, but it fall short of my high exception of Jack Black products.  My first disappointment with Jack Black.	-1
This product has a very sharp scent kind of like a perm, and just the fumes sting my eyes without even applying it. I might have been able to predict it if I had been paying attention as the application instructions particularly avoid the whole eye area. If you have any irritated areas it stings when you apply it.	-1
I've bough RED Reuzel in the past. I like it, but I'm not crazy about the fruity Pina Colada scent. According to the Reuzel website, Blue Reuzel(like the RED Reuzel) is also a high shine pomade, but offers a stronger hold. I read the scent was not fruity, and more like a cologne. I decided to purchase it. Honestly, I don't like the scent at all. It's a powdery, musky, hint of vanilla scent(older lady). It also lingers.  I don't know if it's stronger than the RED in terms of hold, because they both seem to do the same job to me, and hold for the same amount of time(shine maybe a bit less on the blue?).  I will update this if my impressions change, as I'm only on my 3rd day using the BLUE. If I do buy Reuzel again, it will probably be the RED though, because I find that scent a bit less offensive.  ---  Update: I've taken away another star because the scent has become less tolerable to me. Keep in mind, this is subjective and it might work for YOU. It only gets worse though as it settles in with my body's chemistry.  Updated to one star. I cannot handle the scent. I wasted my money unfortunately.	-1
First the vials are a mess, and the company needs to do a better job packaging it inside their container. The shipping box was pristine so this is not a  shipper or amazon issue. Luckily none were broken. Actually using the product for close to two weeks: first person me, had to stop after a couple days because my hair/scalp started flaking very badly. I was using it in front where I'm getting just a little bit of a receding hair line. Somehow my skin did not like this at all. With that a huge fail, I have had another member of the household try it who has very thinning hair. She seems to think her hair is getting a little stronger, but into the 2nd week we have yet to see objective results in before and after pictures. I suspect products like this working or not depends a lot on what causes the problem, prolonged use, and a healthy dose of believing. The ingredients are all natural and organic, so who knows if there is real repeatable un-cherrypicked scientific study to back this up. I hope the FDA starts regulating these types of products so we can know more conclusively if things like this should work. This is awfully expensive for 1/3 of a product (the amount of product needed to see result).	-1
As I said in a previous review, I'm new to Vichy products and so had no idea what to expect as far as quality goes. Idealia fell very flat for me. While the color was a great match and it goes on nicely, I was very disappointed with how it made my skin look and feel. I applied it after moisturizing and even with that, the product seemed to clump, delineating any dry skin areas and making them more noticeable, not less. Someone with oilier skin would probably love this product, and the sunscreen component is nice, but it's definitely not for me.	-1
I am meticulous about applying sunscreen, even in the winter.  I like products that serve multiple purposes, like this one.  Why I like this product:  * It goes on smoothly.  * It has SPF of 25.  I find products with 15 SPF don't provide enough protection.  The sunscreen ingredients:  homosalate (6%), octisalate (5%), octocrylene (7%) and titanium dioxide (3.75%).  * It is tinted, so it makes my skin look smooth and polished.  A big negative for me though was the strong scent of this product.  It is strong and it is very artificial.  I found it quite unpleasant after a while, especially since its on my face and close to my nose.  I gave up using this product because of that.  It is funny how scent is so personal.  Other reviewers remarked on the very light scent.  I am not usually so sensitive to scents, but this scent was very unpleasant for me.	-1
I've tried many other BB creams and have a favorite that I use everyday.  Vichy is a new product for me.  This product doesn't measure up to others I've used.  Most BB creams blend into the skin providing moisture, sun protection and minimal coverage.  I found Vichy to be heavily pigmented and the medium shade is much darker than other products.  This product didn't blend in and looked blotchy and much too dark on my skin.  I would not recommend it.	-1
This product looks beautiful. It's sleek and modern, but you shouldn't buy it.  The barrel doesn't open, so you wrap your hair around it and it gets very hot.  So hot, that I burned myself using it, despite following directions.  I prefer styling wands that open where you curl your hair around the barrel. Nothing holds your hair in place as you turn it and it keeps slipping. This found its way into my trash bin after the first use.	-1
The curling iron is made of two parts that you are supposed to connect, and you can buy and connect different barrels. Unfortunately, mine broke when I was trying to connect the two pieces. The barrel part that goes inside cracked when I tried to lock it. Now there is a big crack along the part of the barrel that goes inside of the handle. It is all plastic in there, and apparently, it cracks way too easy. I called the company - they hung up after a few minutes of wait. I went online, and was able to write to them from there. It says I will receive a response within two business days, but they are still silent. To get warranty repair or replacement you need to have the serial number which is conveniently located on the outside of the box and nowhere else, so you can inadvertently throw it away and possibly be left without warranty. The website states that for warranty you have to have the silver sticker with the serial number still attached, they do not specify what is it supposed to be attached to, though. The website also states that if your product is going to be replaced under warranty, you should send it to them first (it does not say who will pay for it), and they will mail you another one withing three weeks.  I seriously dislike all this kinds of tricks. Aside from being broken now, the iron looks very attractive. The cable is long and swivels easily so it will not be tangled up with use. To exchange barrels, you most definitely have to wait until the one you were using cools down, which probably means you are not going to use two different barrels to make the same hairdo.	-1
cord will burn through. I wish I could return this because it did not last. there is no where to keep the curling iron from heating on the counter	-1
Unfortunately, this item arrived defective.  My wife was able to try it and it gets plenty hot and does a good job of curling her hair.  The problem is that the curling attachment won't fully lock in to place, so she's reluctant to continue to use because she's afraid it will come apart and burn her.  Since I received this through the Vine program, I'm not able to return it.	-1
While this is a super nice curling iron, I had a few issues with it... first off, it's super expensive. I'm not sure the cost is justified... only time will tell with how well it holds up over time.  Secondly, the clip barrel they send is very large, 1.25 inch... and it barely gave my hair a curl; mostly just on the ends. I tried it on my daughter's hair and same thing... just the ends.  This was on the highest setting too. Super strange; usually I can get more curl out of my hair than that! My hair was super hot so I know it should have done more. I think this barrel would be good for giving your hair a bit of body and wave, but not really for long lengths of hair.  The second issue I was having is that it WON'T lock in properly. I followed the directions perfectly and it just wouldn't lock. Maybe this is why it wasn't curling great?  I see others are having similar issues... makes me feel a bit better, that I'm not just doing something wrong.  When a curling iron is 400 degrees, you want to make sure it locks securely!!!  So that's the negatives... what's positive: the design is awesome with the swiveling cord. I also like that you have to HOLD DOWN the power button... no accidentally turning it off while using it.  I like the LEDS that show when it's still heating up, and what level you are at, etc... and it heats up really quick... super nice!  The clip worked great even on my daughter's fine hair... and wasn't overkill on my thicker hair... still opened easily.  And the looks... it's really stunning. Quality seems good as well overall.  For a bit less price, and a fix on the weird locking thing, I would have given this a glowing 5 stars.  But after reading other reviews about their customer service, I'm worried this is going to be a waste of my tax dollars (yes, we Viners get taxed on these items, so they really aren't "free".)  I just can't give this better stars.	-1
Up-Date 2-16. My Granddaughter is a hair dresser. Since this is so large, I do like using this curling iron, I told her to give it a try. She tried it on her long hair. She said, I can't believe how heavy the barrel is. Its very uncomfortable to use, and so heavy. It's still sitting on my top shelve.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The T3 Convertible curling iron, looks very  good, and looks  professional. If you wanted to give this as a gift, the Packaging is very impressive.  As far as being Professional, I do not think this would work well.  Since you have to keep changing hot barrels, and I found it a bit difficult to do,  and If your doing a wedding party, this would not be the iron you would want to use, as It turns off automatically after about a hour!  When you put the barrel in-together, make sure you Unlock it, then Lock it once its in place. To lock etc. is on the middle bronze part. It will have the lock and unlock sign. Although very small to see I think.  I cannot find where it say's how many blue lights are telling you what the temp means? High or Low? You have to double click to get it to move the heat higher or lower. The lights one mine are either 3 lite, or All 5, which is to Hot for my thick weaved hair. . Since its So hot, I'm assuming, I can't get mine down to a lower heat! My older inexpensive electric curling iron lights up the degrees of heat its at, like a oven. This does Not.  The directions are on a large fold out nice paper. But is hard to read in some area's, cause its written So Small!  I like that the curling barrel is Ceramic..  I would not buy this curing iron for the reason I gave, and the price. Although it looks very nice!..	-1
Really disappointed in this palette - the colors do not pick up well on brushes nor is there good color payoff when applied. I returned it.	-1
I have tried other Vichy products; some I've liked and some I haven't. This one is not for me.  The product is a very light, white lotion. You dispense it by unscrewing the lid and waiting for a drop to fall off the dropper-like dispenser.  I tested it in the crook of my elbow first. It absorbed easily on first application, then it started burning. And burning. I don't have sensitive skin, but I had to go wash this off after 5 minutes. No way would I chance using this on my face.  It also has a very strong fragrance.  I'm disappointed that I can't use or recommend this serum.	-1
The blue box is stunning, each item was individually wrapped in tissue paper. As I began opening up each bottle I was over taken by the strong perfume smell. It smelled like old lady powered. I don't understand why companies have to add such harsh perfumes and smells to their products. There are customers who have sensitive skin and sensitive to smells that would like to be able to use their products. It is really disappointing that I was unable again to use a product due to the horrible fragrance choice.	-1
The worst company I ever purchased , my face is red and swelling, burning	-1
Does nothing it says to do. Very watered down and very over priced. I feel lucky me I got ripped off!	-1
I got it from vichy website, am using it for akready a month and got 0 difference :(  Plus it is very sticky	-1
This burns my skin and the fragrance, while fresh and light, is still too strong for me. I have a Vichy facial cleanser I am using now, and have used other moisturizers. In fact, one of their moisturizers was one of the best i've ever used. But, this product doesn't work for me. I put it on a freshly cleaned face and it stung and made my eyes burn from the fragrance. I typically have sensitive skin and eczema, and once had such a strong reaction to the lemon oil in Body Shop's lemon body lotion that I had to go on steroids. But, I am able to easily use exfoliators and other products with scents that do not irritate me. However, most serums  like this (organic brands, high end brands, Body Shop) burn on my skin longer and more intensely than the 'tingle' that others may experience.	-1
Leaves my hair sooo limp.  Looks like I've been working in a grease pit all day.  Don't like it at all.	-1
This is my second product from this brand, and there seems to be a bit of disconnect between the description and what the product actually is--almost like the person writing the copy didn't quite understand English.  First, it is not a foam. It comes out as a thick, non-drippy, almost-solid cream. Second, "cleansing conditioner" had me puzzled. I actually went to the company website to confirm that this is both a shampoo and conditioner in one. "Conditioning cleanser" would have made more sense than "cleansing conditioner."  I usually use DecaCurl products on my hair, which are pretty moisturizing. I only used a small amount of this product (it doesn't lather) and rinsed it out well. I towel-dried my hair and was able to easily comb out the tangles, but was thinking "ewww" the whole time as my wet hair seemed pretty greasy. I blew my natural curls out straight, and used a quick flat ironing here and there.  My hair was shiny and bouncy, but a tad greasy and tacky at the same time. Kind of hard to explain, but I didn't like how it felt. The coating made my hair feel dirty, even though it looked ok.  I don't recommend this product.	-1
I have been using cleansing conditioners for 3 years now, and I don't think my hair has ever been as healthy looking. And like any woman, I get super excited about trying new products and R+Co was no exception. I love the idea that the conditioner comes out like mouse but like mouse, it leaves a nasty film around the top with residual product which feels wasteful considering the price of this product. The smell is weird and almost metallic.... Not pleasant at all. My final complaint on the result after using the product is that it left my scalp oily. I have tried quite a few cleansing conditioners and none left my hair feeling stiff with oil. This is my experience with this conditioner and I'm sure that someone else's experience is amazing, but I am really disappointed.	-1
The product itself is pretty good. Not spectacular and there was a lot of overlap in performance for everything except the clay. But each of these are 15mL. It means total its a little under 2.03oz. These should be free samples included with orders. $14/oz is nuts for hair product even above average as these are. They are more expensive than a Kobe steak. Ive had excellent caviar that was cheaper.  As to the actual products I was not a fan of the waxy hard cream. i much prefer a stick like product if thats what im going for. For my curly hair it just didn't do enough without a lot of work. The cream was a real winner. It was just right. The clay is like the sticks I like so that too I liked for that mussy sort of look that keeps curls from frizzing. The hard water seemed just like putting in regular old water for my hair. It worked at first but got frizzy as the day went on. It was by far the prettiest in the jar of the group though.	-1
I'm not a fan of this. It smells very sweet and the cream feels very slick in your hands. The bottle says this stuff tames frizz and helps get your curls/wave in control.... it technically does do this, but at a cost.  I scrunched a dollop through my wet hair as directed. Dried my hair and looked at my reflection in horror. Yes, my hair my frizz free and the natural, humidity induced curling was definitely reduced. However, in exchange for that, my hair was flat and felt oily. It looked dirty and limp. I have long, very thick hair that normally has lots of bounce and life and shine. It reacts poorly to high humidity and can be a big puff ball, but the limp, hanging results from this cream was not a good substitute. It's probably a good product for shorter hair that is already really dry or heavily processed.	-1
Obliphica Professional Seaberry Shine Mist Spray I don't like this product at all. To me, it smelled awful and the oil in the product was too heavy and greasy. My hair became a fuzzy mass with an oily appearance. And, I smelled like the oil.	-1
This smells great and definitely made my hair shiny, but it is so heavy my hair felt greasy after spraying it on. I have limp, fine hair, so that may be the problem. I tried it twice, spraying really light the second time, and it still made a mess of my hair and made it look like it needed another washing. But I wouldn't use this product.	-1
This made my sensitive eyes itch and water and turn red. I washed it off and my eyes immediately felt better. However, the next morning I had puffy, red lids.  Also, looks nice but you get spider eyes if you apply one stroke too many.  On the good side, it washed off easily.	-1
Although I'm in the target age group for this product, I was disappointed to find it too greasy for me to use. During the day it made my skin look oily and unwashed, and at night, it just felt uncomfortable, even though I only applied it to the drier parts of my face.  This is a little bottle of product, but since you only pump out smaller amounts, it will probably last for a while. There is a subtle fragrance, but it's not unpleasant.  I intend to use this on the backs of my hands and other non-face areas, and see if there are any skin improvements.	-1
I have been looking for the right products that could reduce the appearance of crow's feet and laugh lines in my aging skin. I have tried Collagen and Retinol based skin care products. While they seem to help a bit, I wanted something better and more effective. When I heard good things about Cindy Crawford's Meaningful Beauty line of products, I decided to give it a try.  The Ultra Lifting and Filling Treatment seemed like a promising anti-aging serum at first. A couple of pumps from the bottle went a long way. It went on silkily and left my skin feeling soft and smooth. That was until the next morning when I woke up to breakouts. There were several red blotches as well. Needless to say, I wasn't thrilled at all.  I don't know if it is too harsh or my skin is too sensitive. It seems to irritate my skin more than improving it. At any rate, this product is not for me.	-1
I used this lifting cream based on the directions and it didn't seem to work very well for me.  It stays sticky for a really long time, so you have to wait at least 1/2 hour before applying foundation over it.  It is hot and humid where I live and perhaps that is why.  The last time I used it, I put it on the fine lines under my eyes and around my mouth after I put my makeup on and that worked better for me.  I saw a bit of an improvement but not enough to justify the price.	-1
I'm nearly 50 with dry, sensitive skin. I think this is more a temporary line filler than a product that would produce any worthwhile cumulative effects. After using this twice, I had more milia pop up, probably due to the large amount of dimethicone (a silicone) in this product that would explain the ability of it to temporarily fill the lines/wrinkles. Milia are hard white bumps that form underneath the skin's surface, not to be confused with whiteheads.  I normally don't care for fragrance, but this has a pleasant, very light fruity scent, and the treatment spread easily on my face without much tugging. However, no matter how little I used, it was sticky and made my face shiny. I noticed absolutely no lifting effect.  If you have an event where you want to temporarily fill the wrinkles, this product may be for you, although there are probably cheaper alternatives.	-1
This appears to be yet another product with a celebrity name that costs more than many products but doesn't deliver meaningful results.  I haven't really been able to notice any difference in the appearance of my face using this product, but it does feel extremely silky going on in a way that other products haven't felt on my skin. I'll probably use it if I run out of other products just to keep my skin treated and because it feels nice, but I certainly wouldn't purchase it.	-1
I was hesitant to try this product due to the reviews of it causing breakouts and blotchiness but I gave it a go. Happily I did not break out but I did not see results either. It made the fine lines under my eyes stand out more. It felt greasy and sticky. I don't like the smell either. I do not wear foundation and this product just made my skin look shiny. I did like the packaging. The pump is nice. But it is not something I would purchase.	-1
I think the best possibility of this treatment working is if you have a basis of good genes.  This does smooth out some imperfections, but it is sticky and more than that very expensive for any results that you might get. It is an impossibility that your skin will begin to look like Cindy Crawfords unless your genes are aimed in that direction.  The directions say 1 or 2 pumps, massage into your face and neck in the morning and let dry then follow up with the rest of the Meaningful beauty system. Personally it feels uncomfortable to have this on my skin during the day and my makeup does not look as good.  The advertised glow seems to come from the fact you have this gel like substance on your face, not from a skin improvement.	-1
This didn't work for me.  It produced puffiness, which is really not the sort of wrinkle minimizing I hoped for, or want.  I also have several red blotches, which are taking (at least) a few days to fade.  It's not a lovely look.  Am I allergic to the product?  I don't think so.  On the other hand, there were unpleasant sensitizing effects each time I tried the product, and they did not mitigate at all the next time I used the product.  I may try again when my skin is completely back to normal--and the pollen count is very low.  But I may well not.  For me, this has proved to be more of a skin irritant than a skin improvement.	-1
Can't give a long term review because after one use, I have decided I will not be using more of it.  I have sensitive dry skin.  I had tried this brand's serum and figured why not?  I don't have many signs of wrinkles yet but do have a few old acne scars, so a "filling" cream is something I'm willing to try even if that sounds like an unbelievable claim -- even if it benefits my skin in any way, it'd be worth trying.  I'd only try one other product that claimed to have any filling benefit (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/L-Or-eacute-al-Paris-Revitalift-Volume-Filler-Daily-Volumizing-Moisturizer-1-7-Ounce/dp/B00PFEFHAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">L'Or&eacute;al Paris Revitalift Volume Filler Daily Volumizing Moisturizer, 1.7 Ounce</a>) and it was at least a good moisturizer.  This filler, however, not only didn't have any "filler" benefit but also left my skin angry.  At first it did feel like there was something to it... Run my hand over my face and it felt pretty smooth.  Felt tight.  That's always a good feature from anything you're putting on your face.  Within minutes it felt dry and itchy.  May be for some people but for me?  Something in it is not agreeing with my skin.  Any benefit that it might offer isn't worth the reaction I had to it.  There's no ingredient list on the bottle, so I searched them out...  not sure what is bothering my skin, but something is.  Did not have this reaction with their serum so it's definitely something in this product and not necessarily in all of their product line.  Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Isopentyldiol, Dimethicone, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Orchid Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearyl Alcohol, Phytosterols, Glyceryl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Tocopherol, Behenyl Alcohol, Batyl Alcohol, Polyacrylamide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum).	-1
Utterly overpriced. I am so glad I never caved in to one of those informercials over the past several years. The serum is fairly light and sticky, and once it dries it's supposed to smooth over your skin. I suppose it does this job fairly well, for the day, but it's not permanent and it's certainly not worth its cost. There are many other products, including the Vitamin C serum from Body Shop, that do the same thing for less than half the price.  The scent is very light and didn't bother me, and I am very sensitive to fragrance. And, it didn't irritate my skin, although it feels very tingly when you first put it on until it dries.	-1
This is a generous portion of a moisturizing product that includes both two kinds of cream and a clear gel component. In terms of effectiveness, it is okay for plumping fine lines and making skin feel softer and smoother in a non-greasy way. However, in terms of anti-aging effects, it is not as effective as L'Oreal Paris Revitalift (which is the best "anti-aging" product that I've tried so far due to its lightening and exfoliating effects) at 1/3 the price. It's also not as good as L'occitane's moisturizers in general (which work better for very fine wrinkles around the eyes) if you're comparing to a product at a similar price point.  The contents look cool in the bottle, but the bottle itself feels very cheap with the silver tone plastic caps. At $60/oz., I expect something that is better presented as well as more impressive in terms of performance. The smell is also a very faintly chemical one with a whiff of some very faint perfume to mask it - though you can only smell it when it is close to your nose. This isn't a bad product, but, for the price point, it's underwhelming both in terms of performance and look and feel.	-1
I've used this for ten days and I can say it's a nice moisturizer...but I'm not noticing anything more than that. I previously purchased the entire Meaningful Beauty set and left a review for it called, "Meaningful Acne" because of the horrible condition of my face afterwards. THIS product however didn't seem to cause any flare ups or bumps. It's a really nice moisturizer,  I'm just not seeing any difference in my face. I'll continue to use it until it's gone and if anything changes for the better I will definitely update my review.  UPDATE: I had a constellation of deep bumps appear under my jawline and chin. DEEP hard like marbles...it took about the ten days of 'no acne' for them to appear so they must have been festering for awhile. It took another week for me to get rid of them!!! I'm sorry but there's just something in Meaningful Beauty that my skin doesn't like. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who gets acne. CYSTIC acne no less. Nothing like marbles in your skin.	-1
She Who Must Be Obeyed has made it clear that she did not like this product period.  The list of ingredients alone made her face pale (the only discernible difference the product made in her appearance).  She was expecting a product heavy with melon extract and light on chemical enhancements.  The Lauryl Sulfates alone are daunting to say the least.  She decided to try it anyway because she had had me request it and she felt guilty if she didn't at least give it a shot.  She started at the beginning and worked her way through most of the other products, but each time she read the ingredients she paled a little more and finally she put them down and said she wasn't going to finish the program.  She feared the effects of the plainly listed ingredients.  She has spoken and She doesn't take these things lightly.  For the price She feels the products you buy should be natural and healthy not questionalble chemicals piled on top of one another.  One Star is all She could muster.	-1
First, I tried "Meaningful Beauty  Wrinkle Smoothing Capsules Advanced Formula w/Hyaluronic Acid" and I hated it because it made my face look older and more wrinkled after a week's use.  I decided to try this one because I was interested in the cleanser and night cream.  I didn't like that there wasn't a detailed, but simple description of each product on the Amazon page.  Instead there was a long blah-blah-blah description of leaf serum.  You have to purchase the box to see each item and what they do.  I did get this from Amazon to test for free in lieu of an honest review.  I am 53 and very Caucasian.  My face used to break out a little when I was younger, mostly from environment.  My face will breakout with some makeup. I also have to wear glasses and I hate that I have to wear my glasses to in front of the bathroom sink to read the directions on what each one does.  Take a hint Meaningful Beauty.  We're old.  We have wrinkles.  We're farsighted!  I used the exfoliating cream felt nice and didn't burn my face like others have in the past.  It did seem to work on my neck which felt smoother.  I then used the cleanser.  It was crap.  It didn't really clean anything.  I put it on showered and put my nail to my face because it felt like there was a film on it.  Nope, the film was actually my foundation still on my face.  I faired better with the SPF 30 moisturizer.  It was light and went nicely with my foundation.  We did a lot better here.  But...we'll get to that in a minute.  The night cream went on heavier than the Oil of Olay I normally use.  I had to take an extra minute washing my face in the morning.  I don't know if that is bad or good.  it felt like it was on top of my skin if that makes sense.  I did use this for five days and let me tell you, for $54 bucks the product goes fast.  Now for the "but".  First I got one pimple on my cheek.  Then I got one on the side of my face between my ear and eye.  Not happy since I haven't had a pimple in about a year.  Finally, I don't think a selling point is Cindy on the box because either she has had some work done on here face or she was really PhotoShopped.  She has that whole Joker smile on her.	-1
This Meaningful Beauty kit didn't work for me. It makes my normal-to-oily skin too oily and more prone to acne. It gave me a bad breakout just a couple of days after using it. Some of the ingredients must not agree with my skin. Besides, the packaging looks cheap and the pump has stopped working after a week. Overall, I don't like it at all. It seems to make my skin worst. I won't be using it again.	-1
I have naturally oily skin and not all skin care lines work for me. This just made my face sticky and super oily and felt like I was wearing a mask all day. I used it a couple of times and tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but I won't be using it any more. Plus, it doesn't come with a daily face wash. What's a proper skin care routine with no face wash??!!	-1
This is just not for me. It charged ok, but buttons are difficult to work, I have to press multi times to get it going. Once it is working I have doubts on any dark circle reduction. I cant keep it facing the correct way and I end up with one curve flapping up and down. I don't like watching it pulling on my delicate eye area. Like I said just not for me.	-1
Unfortunately, in my own experience, this fell very short of my expectations.  I gave the product the benefit of doubt after reading about its reported effects.  I got absolutely ZERO benefits from it. In fact on the contrary, it seemed to loosen the skin after a few weeks of use and I Was using it according to instructions. I discontinued use.  This is one of those products, in my opinion that promises exactly what consumers want and need.  False promises is what you're getting if you purchase it.  Spend your money on a high quality eye firming gel.	-1
I'd only try it again if I were younger as I worry about it stretching and damaging delicate skin around the eye. Didn't notice any improvement in getting rid of bags and puffiness.	-1
It wiggles around but doesnt feel good and after a month there is no difference that I can see	-1
Foreo's Iris Illuminating Eye Massager is advertised as an electric version of finger-tapping that will promote "younger-looking, refreshed eyes", presumably by increasing the circulation to the area. The device is 5 inches tall, 1 5/8 inches wide, and covered in silicone in the color of your choice. Each treatment takes one minute, 30 seconds on each eye. The gadget has two modes: Spa Mode (press once), which combines the tapping with vibration, and Pure Mode (press twice), in which the massager simply wiggles to create a sensation similar to tapping. According to Foreo, the Spa Mode is for older customers who need a little more help around the eyes. You can also adjust the frequency of the tapping/wiggling with plus and minus buttons, but you will probably not use those.  First, read the instructions if you can. I required a magnifying glass to read the enclosed user manual. The downloadable manual on Foreo's web site is more legible. Second, charge your massager. This requires a USB charger; it won't plug directly into an A/C outlet. Foreo claims that one charge will last up to 140 uses or 140 minutes. That's possible. I've been using mine for 3 weeks (about 20 uses), and it's still going strong. Press the center indentation to turn the device on. Press twice if you prefer Pure Mode. Apply some moisturizer or serum to the eye area. Move the massager along the brow bone above the eye and underneath the eye just above the bone until the massager skips or pauses. This indicates that 30 seconds have passed, and you should move to the other eye. After one minute, you will feel 3 skips. The device turns itself off after 3 minutes. Wash the Iris with soap and water.  It is better to use moisturizer than serum, as serum will soak in before you get to the second eye. You want some lubricant to be present. Otherwise, the silicone tugs at the skin. Foreo claims that this tapping and vibrating helps eye creams absorb better, but I don't know why it would. I found the Spa Mode uncomfortable. The Pure Mode was less so. I'm in my forties and showing some puffiness under my eyes. I tried the Iris to see if it might improve circulation enough to reduce the puffiness. After three weeks of using the massager once daily, I do not see any difference in puffiness, and it is uncomfortable to use. If it felt good, it would have redeeming value, but it doesn't. The packaging is nice; the quality of the massager and battery seem good. But it doesn't do anything.	-1
I love the color of the "FOREO IRIS Illuminating Eye Massager, T-Sonic, Anti-age & Fatigue, Petal Pink" and the soft feel of the silicone handle.  And that is where my love ends!  This is a pure gimmick; it does nothing to improve skin tone, quality, or appearance.  If you have $139 - the price as of this review - to fritter away, by all means purchase this item.	-1
I've tried to like this item because it sounds so exciting however, it's not.  The design is awful and it looks like some kind of sex toy.  I've used it for about 2 weeks and I see no noticeable difference it feels like the most ridiculous thing I've ever tried to use.  And trust me, I wanted to like it, in fact I wanted to like it a lot.  I just don't the only thing that's nice about it is the rubberized coating and the color.	-1
This device is honestly just a little odd, and I am not sure what to make of it. For the price, I would expect a bit more, but it comes off as one of those "As Seen on TV" devices that you play with for awhile and soon put away. It is supposed to emulate a two-finger massage for under your eye, but that's not what it feels like. The "fingers" are rough and mechanical (Obviously) and it actually kind of hurts. It's also not the most comfortable thing to hold while moving it around your eyes.  My wife and I tried this for a bit before giving up. The next day we didn't see any results for all our fiddling with it. I think she is going to give it another go, but for me this was a bust.	-1
I charged the massager for a full day - the light at bottom indicated it was fully charged. I can only find one 'mode' where the vibration intensity may be increased or decreased with the + and - buttons. The unit has only a very gentle vibration at best  - the top part should oscillate back and forth, which it did not do. The instructions are not helpful. Its difficult to tell if the buttons are being activated when you press them. I was going to send back and reorder thinking I received a defective product, but honestly, it didn't seem to be very well constructed.	-1
I'd been watching the infomercial with Jane Seymour for quite awhile so I was excited to try this. I've noticed crepey skin in my d&eacute;collet&eacute; area when leaning over. I've used this consistently the past 2 weeks and have noticed no change at all in my skin. This product has an obnoxious scent that makes me cough, is a lot of work that needs to be kept up. I think that my d&eacute;collet&eacute; area looks even drier now than it did when I was using a simple inexpensive facial moisturizer in that area. The same results can probably be obtained by buying a gentle drugstore exfoliator along with a moisturizer for a lot less cost.	-1
This is a good moisturizer and exfoliating product but no where near the miracle worker it claims to be and you might expect from the price.  I gave this to an older relative to try and she found it to be a pleasant enough product to use but way  overpriced for the tiny amount you get and what positive effects there are unfortunately only last for a short time.  Alas this is another product that does not spring from a  fountain of youth despite its claims.	-1
I don't have a problem with crepiness, but I am beginning to see the very beginnings of something resembling it under my upper arms. Like yuck! (Aging really sucks.)  Naturally I'd be for anything that would forestall it. I was glad to try the Crepe Erase two part system (despite the name, which gives me the heebies.) The moisturizer is OK, the scrub like most average scrubs. So all I have to do is use a scrub and moisturize and it'll all be fine? Because regardless of what the company claims, after several weeks, I see zero change in my incipient underarm crepiness. If this product is supposed to make a difference, it's not doing a thing I can see.  Two stars cause the products aren't horrible, but minus three stars cause I don't see that they do at all what the manufacturer claims. You can get a similar result a lot cheaper with almost any moisturizer and sugar scrub for a LOT less. Pass.	-1
I saw this product, Crepe Erase, available in the Amazon Vine program and wanted to try it because my skin is starting to look old (crepey) in some areas mainly due to constant tanning when I was younger. (The product description actually states CREEPY-looking skin in one place; I assume this is a typo!)  Given the list price of this, it is not something I would likely buy myself; luckily, I had the opportunity to try it free of charge.  The 10 oz jar is quite big.  If they marketed a jar about one-third of the size (and about one-third of the cost), I think people would be more likely to try it because it would not be so cost-prohibitive.  I was not familiar with Crepe Erase, so I did some reading about it on the Internet.  Crepe Erase is made in the USA and is distributed by Guthy-Renker, a marketing company that sells products to consumers through infomercials, television ads, direct mail, telemarketing, e-mail marketing, and the Internet.  They use celebrity endorsements for their products.  Jane Seymour is the celebrity endorser of Crepe Erase.  The products marketed by Guthy-Renker are usually more expensive than similar products available at your local grocery and drug stores.  Bottom line, the question is:  Does Crepe Erase work better than other comparable products to make it worth its price?  Well  I have now used the product for almost two weeks.  While Crepe Erase works well as a moisturizer, I have not seen any noticeable difference in the youthfulness of my skin.  According to their website:  Results can vary for each individual.  Some users can notice visible results after the first application, while it can take others up to 60 days or longer.  Directions state for best results to use with Crepe Erase Exfoliating Body Polish, which I did not do because of the cost.  Bottom line, based on cost and results thus far, I do not recommend this product.  However, I will continue using it until the jar is gone and will update my review should I notice any changes in the appearance of my skin.	-1
I ordered the Crepe Erase Body Cream, which I really like, but the Crepe Erase Facial Scrub just isn't for me. The scrub didn't leave me feeling like my face was fresh and clean. Instead of feeling like I'd just washed my face, it felt as though I'd used something heavy or slightly oily. Also, the micro beads didn't exfoliate as much as they actually left tiny scratches on my face.  I've been exfoliating with St. Ives Peach Facial Scrub since I was in my teens, and I know to scrub very gently.  It might be the difference between St. Ives natural, ground peach pit scrub, and Crepe Erase's plastic micro beads, which I found to be too harsh for my sensitive skin. Also, plastic micro beads aren't biodegradable, which isn't good for our waterways. (Something our older son pointed out to me.)  I've been really happy with the St. Ives facial scrub for many years, and it's what our kids prefer as well, so I'll continue to buy St Ives, even though I did really like the Crepe Erase Body Cream. (Which I'll be reviewing separately.)	-1
I was hoping to get to try this out, but I happen to be allergic to all sorts of things.  Because of this, I always try products on my hands before I try them on my face.  Unfortunately, I broke out in hives (for 3 days) after trying this out on my hands and so I can't use it any further.	-1
I hate to complain, I got the worst rash ever from this product. I have no idea what triggered it. I washed my face, I used my normal moisturizer, and about 15 minutes later my face felt like it was on fire. I had red blotches everywhere. It took two days to go down.  This may not happen to all users, but this is what I experienced. I do have large pores, and moderately sensitive skin. It was not heavily fragranced, I'm not sure if it was the wash with my moisturizer, or the wash alone, but it hurt.	-1
I tried to use Crepe Erase and found it so heavily perfumed, it was nauseating. I used it on my hands and didn't notice much to write about. Certainly not any better than a store brand Olay. Some may have great results but if you have any perfume sensitivities, stay clear. The strong, alcohol/perfume lingered and every time I put my hand near my lips, they actually stung. I could never use this product on my face. You do get a nice big tube, so there's that. This product is not for me.	-1
It is creamy and goes on so smooth, the scent isn't overpowering. So far I have found no difference in my facial skin and the moisture doesn't seem to last long so my wrinkles appear more prevalent after a half hour or so. I feel this product doesn't live up to its claims, I can see no tightening my my skin and the wrinkles are not disguised and look actually worse if I only use this product. My face started looking so bad that I had to start using my usual products. Sorry but for my face it si pretty much thumbs down on this particular cream.	-1
Product did not do as advertized. Left hair limp and stiff.	-1
Been using this for about a week and not really seeing a difference.  Not sure if I used too much, but gets kind of a build up and starts kinda peeling, not a good look during the day.  It stings a bit when you first put it on, but it stops after just a few minutes.	-1
Jury is still out on this and I will update as I keep using it but so far I'm not that impressed.  I notice no difference in any wrinkle or line and the "filling effect" is not so much.  I know nothing really will completely fill in wrinkles but so far this has done absolutely nothing.	-1
I found this product to be frustrating, not terrible but not worth the high price.  Firstly it commits the packaging sin of having TWICE as much space in the box as the tiny little bottle takes up.  There is literally no reason for it to be in that size box, except to imply that the consumer is getting more product than they are actually getting.  Dishonest.  It has a very strong, distinctive smell which I personally did not prefer for my face.  It lingers because the serum is an oil base, so you still get whiffs of the smell long after you've applied it.  It takes a while to sink in due to the oily nature of the product.  While I think this allows for a good concentration of the hyaluronic acid component, it's a little unpleasant if you accidentally touch your face before it's absorbed.  I strongly dislike this brand's lack of a transparent disclosure of ingredients.  I want to know exactly what I'm putting on my face.  This information is severely lacking - they say that it's hyaluronic acid and oil, but that's it.  I'm sure there are other additives.	-1
Felt like baby oil. Very heavy on the skin. Broke my skin out.	-1
This serum is very oily. Too oily for a serum. It's very slick on the skin and goes on more like a layer rather than absorbing right in. It takes quite a while for it to absorb, and actually, I don't feel like it ever fully absorbs no matter how lightly a I apply it. My skin feels oily and slick until I wash it off... such as if I apply it in the morning, it'll stay greasy feeling all the way into the evening/night unless I wash my face sooner than that.  I don't have many wrinkles aside from a few tiny ones at the corner of my eyes, but I didn't see any improvement in those. I didn't think my skin looked better or worse in general, except for the fact that using this serum made me break out in tiny pimples on my upper lip.  I wouldn't buy this due to how oily it is and the lack of any kind of benefit from using it.	-1
My baby has a tendency to get rashy if she's in a dirty diaper too long (which could literally mean sitting in it for ten minutes while we drive to a rest stop), so we use a lot of zinc oxide-based diaper cream to get rid of and control her diaper rash. This one just didn't do the trick for her bottom. It has a lower percentage of zinc oxide (9.9%) than Desitin Rapid Relief (13%), and I think that's the problem for my kiddo. It's just not enough zinc oxide to keep her bottom dry enough. The Mustela cream didn't prevent rashiness, either, when we applied it to a non-rashy bottom.  The "naturalness" of the cream's ingredients will appeal to some parents (we're not as concerned about that), but I wouldn't recommend this for babies that easily get diaper rash. It just isn't strong enough.	-1
My daughter has been having some GI issues so I thought this would be great as a barrier cream to help her but it appears she is allergic to the zinc and it left her red, bumpy and irritated everywhere I put it.	-1
Mustela makes a big thing about their products being natural and hypoallergenic. Since I have sensitive skin, I always try a dab of any cream on the inside of my arm (where the skin is thin) and wait for a few hours. It only took a few seconds to realize that the Stretch Marks Prevention cream was problematic for me! It made my skin red and irritated, even on the back of my hand where I rubbed the leftover portion when more came out of the tube than I expected. I immediately washed my skin but it stayed red for a while and felt like it was burning.  So what is in this prevention cream? MustelaUSA says "AQUA/WATER/EAU, DI-C12-13 ALKYL MALATE, ETHYLHEXYL COCOATE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CERA ALBA/BEESWAX/CIRE DABEILLE, LAURETH-23, GALACTOARABINAN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, GLYCERYL STEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), XANTHAN GUM, CETYL PALMITATE, COCOGLYCERIDES, SCLEROTIUM GUM, ZINC GLUCONATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FRUIT EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED AVOCADO PROTEIN, MALTODEXTRIN, CITRIC ACID, LUPINUS ALBUS SEED EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL." (I apologize for the caps but I pasted this from their site.)  None of these are among my usual allergens but many of them I have not heard of.  I have had problems with some fragrances and a few fruit products. Fragrance can be anything so it is hard to judge but it is noticeable as soon as you open the tube. In EWG's Skin Deep Database, fragrance is the ingredient that keeps this product from getting a high rating, along with Laureth-23, which they say can cause irritation and organ system toxicity, and zinc gluconate, which can bioaccumulate and also has organ system toxicity.  The Mustela website claims good results based on a "Clinical trial conducted on 26 pregnant women who used this product throughout their pregnancy."  But personally I cannot recommend it. I did not dare to try the second product in the package after the bad experience with the first one. It also contains fragrance.  This set is made in France.	-1
The bust cream is particularly absurd. I bought it for my wife. The bust cream is a silicone-like, clear cream, with a slight scent that dries clear. There's a big difference between a slightly tight feel on your skin and actually firming breasts. You need several pumps (each pump is not much cream) to have enough to cover your breasts. The stretch mark cream is a thin, white cream with a stronger scent. There's nothing remotely medical about these cosmetic lotions.  I really like the Mustela brand for their Stelatopia unscented moisturizing lotion, and we've used a ton of their milky bath oil when bathing our child, but these lotions are being marketed with pseudo scientific nonsense. The firming agents are a joke, with trace quantities of avocado that have no medical action.  It's a shame when a brand builds trust with one product, just to erode it with false claims on another.	-1
I took this because I am very pale and need sunscreen daily. I am not impressed. I let this warm up in my bathroom for 8 hours before I tried it ( it was cold coming in from the mail). I almost could not get it out of the tube, it was so thick. It did not apply easily with a make up sponge so I used my fingers. My skin looked uniform but uniformly chalky.  I am not sure who the intended market is for this product but I ended up with an unpleasant orange tone to my skin. Unless I followed this with a lot of foundation, I could never wear it to work or out. I might take it with me on a camping vacation where no one will really see me. Overall I did not like the thick consistency nor the color tone. It would be helpful for customers to get a sense of how deep the color is of this product....perhaps a color swatch? Had I known the depth of the color I'd have never chosen this.	-1
I was excited to try this product, but sadly, was disappointed. The formula itself is very nice; a light lotion that glides on without a sticky feel. It has a merest trace of fragrance. I don't have sensitive skin on my face, but I always do a patch test elsewhere first, just in case. I applied this serum to the back of my hands, and immediately felt a burning sensation. I thought it might subside, but it continued to burn and burn until I washed it off. This is a no from me.	-1
I wrestled with how to rate the MEG21 Eye Treatment. The information from the company states that results should be visible in "four weeks or less." To fairly evaluate MEG21 I used it exclusively for 32 consecutive days. I stopped using my usual eye treatment, replacing it with MEG21. However, I continued the rest of my normal routine. The advertising for this product, as well as, many of the reviews speak of incredible, visible results - unfortunately, I did not have a similar experience. From the beginning: The packaging is nice. I really like the pump dispenser, it was easy to open, did not clog and can be locked back into place. This is especially helpful for those that travel and/or those who have small children at home. (Many a cream has been playfully dispensed onto my counter and floor. I wish all products had a locking cap like this one.) The cream itself is thin, very silky to the touch, with a barely noticeable scent. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. This product did NOT cause any type of irritation or tearing of the eyes. (I mention this because it has happened with two other eye creams in the past.) The "highlight" effect in MEG21 is almost overdone. If you have bags under your eyes, even small ones, this cream highlights those - making them even more noticeable. I used this eye treatment daily and there's been no softening of lines, tightening of the skin or reduction in puffiness. Even the over eye skin shows no improvement. I expected the over eye skin to at least reap some level of moisturizing benefit... But, I was wrong.  MEG21 has an enticing advertising pitch and a well packaged product - unfortunately that's all. This product is overpriced and failed to deliver any of the benefits for which it was intended. For these reasons I cannot, in good conscience recommend MEG21 to others.	-1
Ive been looking for an eye treatment for years that would counteract the dark circles and crepe-y skin under my eyes.  These were issues Ive battled since my teens, but nothing has ever helped.  And now, at close to forty, I see the first signs of crows feet forming.  Youd think Id give up.  But I havent.  MEG 21 Bright & Firm Eye Treatment claims that its exclusive Supplamine technology, combined with anti-inflammatory ingredients and botanical extracts, significantly reduces the appearance of puffiness, discoloration, fine lines and crows feet. The eye appears more luminous and visibly rejuvenated.  It claims it can do this thanks to a process discovered through diabetes research. According to the box, results should be visible in four weeks or less.  I cant say I was excited about the MEG 21 Bright & Firm Eye Treatment.  Ive tried so many products at this point  drug store brands, pricey high end treatments, and even organic, homemade balms whipped up by a good friend just for me  and none of them have worked the way I needed them to or lived up to the promises on the box, website, or commercials.  I was pretty sure this, too, would be another product Id use one bottle of with no results and never go near again, and I was right.  It has a pleasant smell and a silky feel, but after a few weeks of use Ive noticed no difference whatsoever in the appearance of skin around my eyes.  Its still crepe-y, I still have dramatically dark circles, I have puffiness most mornings, and the crows feet haven't gotten any smoother.  We won't talk about the crinkliness when I smile, okay?  It didn't break me out or cause any irritation, but I did notice that when I woke up in the mornings my skin felt drier than it would with some of the other eye creams Ive used.  At the Amazon price of $63.82 for half an ounce as of this writing, I cant recommend it when it did absolutely nothing for me.	-1
Do not like this at all. Worst makeup spray I've tried and it could all be fixed by making it an aerosol. The problem is it's TOO liquidy. It leaked all over the lid and when I pulled the lid off, this stuff went everywhere. So there's shipping issues they need to fix. And then I went to spray it on my face, following the instructions, 8 inches away, and it shot giant blobs of liquid all over my face. That doesn't help my makeup; it ruins it.  I've tried a makeup spray before and it was an aerosol and sprayed over my face thinly and evenly. This does not.	-1
I have heard all the hype about the Clarisonic cleansing brushes, but I did not want to shell out $100+ for a tool to wash my face. When I got the opportunity to review this product, which is a less-expensive copycat of the Clarisonic, I decided to give it a try. First of all, be aware that you have to charge this for 24 hours before using. In actuality, the blinking "charge" lights went out after about 12 hours, so it was probably fine then but I gave it the full 24 to be fair. It's not intuitive how to connect the charger (it's magnetic), so I had to read the instructions. It's probably a good thing that I read them because there is a warning not to unplug the charger before disconnecting it from the brush, because the battery can discharge and then you would have to start over again. When I finally got to use this product, I was not impressed at all. The brush is very soft (a good thing) but it vibrates (as opposed to spinning) and it just made my head vibrate and feel uncomfortable. It actually felt like a mild electric shock. There is a vibrating timer on the brush that tells you to move to a new area, but based on this timing it would take about 45 minutes to wash my entire face. When I moved the brush to my nose, I felt actual pain (I broke my nose a few years ago and had a surgical repair, but have never felt pain after the initial healing until I used this brush). I tried to give it to my teenage daughter, but she has sensitive, acne-prone skin and didn't want to risk using this product. Maybe I'll use it to clean my shower.	-1
Not sure this does anything. Not powerful and has an annoying usb charger.	-1
** UPDATE ** 11-25-2017 Worked great, for just about 1 year.  Now the battery will no longer hold a charge at all.  Which is incredibly sad when you are paying so much for a product that works really well.  Honestly this company can't spend a few more cents for a decent battery that will hold up?  My induction rechargeable toothbrush has a better set up; it has lasted for 6 years and is still going strong.  Come on Clarisonic - I am not the only one who has brought this topic up.  There is an entire group of YouTube videos dedicated to detailing how to break into your products in the complicated process solely to swap out the cheap battery for a low cost - high quality battery. Treat your customers with a little more respect. ===========================================  My wife likes to call this her "little genie".  The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.  My wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.  As others have stated, soak it in hydrogen peroxide every few weeks.  Kind of pricey, but well made and certainly worth it.  Cheers!	-1
If this wasn't a brand new package I would wonder if it were old. It goes on chunky and clumps off the brush and in your eyelashes. The color is fine, but I won't buy again because of the way it doesn't go on smoothly.	-1
Sorry Julep - I love many of your products and nailpolishes but this is not a great product for $20.  I have used far better drugstore mascaras at a fraction of the price.  It is light and buildable but you need to put on lots of layers and there is no curl or lift.  pros - doesn't clump!	-1
My wife recently was unpleasantly surprised by her brand name mascara product change: from a solid to a flexibly lame applicator. She needed to find a new mascara brand. Enter Julep. The new product is easy to apply; washes easily as well; stays on well; easy on eyes; doesn't clump; unfortunately, the all important applicator[the reason for the buy] didn't have long enough bristles to get the necessary job done.  The search continues for another brand that hits ALL the bases.	-1
While I quite like CK One, as does my spouse, this one falls short of the goal of being great for both masculine and feminine preferences.  The fragrance in the bottle isn't exactly inspiring, but I tried it on me anyway.  On my female body, it smelled better than in the bottle - a definite plus.  On my husband, however, it didn't smell right at all.  Neither he nor I could stand how it smelled on him.  To quote him on how he felt about it, "I do not have words to express how much I HATE HATE HATE this fragrance. It's not terrible on you, but it turns my stomach and it has no redeeming features at all."  I think it's only okay on me, and I certainly wouldn't buy it for myself.	-1
Whatever the white residue in this left me with tons of little whitehead bumps all over my skin (especially my forehead) and terrible blackheads around my nose after two days of use. I looked like I had a ruddy complexion practically overnight.  I am really surprised by all the positive reviews. I wanted to like this product as I am a fan of La Roche Posay in general, but after using this sunscreen on two separate trips to Florida where I experienced horrible breakouts with this sunscreen as the only common denominator, I'll never touch it again.	-1
Had high hopes for this expensive sunscreen. Leaves a white cast to my face (I am fair-skinned) and emphasizes every flake (I exfoliate religiously). Disappointed in amount of shine -- very obvious on the skin, at least on mine. I would not purchase this particular sunscreen again, although I have used other La Roche-Posay sunscreens in the past and have like them well enough. I prefer the more "watery-liquidy" ones as opposed to creams for my combination skin. This just wasn't for me. For the price, there are better options out there.	-1
I seem to be the only one who wasn't blown away by the product. My biggest pet peeve is when items don't come with directions. Don't make me guess and don't make me go to your website to figure out how to use your product. Once I finally figured it out it seemed awkward and fumbled in my hands. I couldn't maintain a good grip on it and it felt really weird and intense on my face. My skin didn't thank me after and it felt almost raw afterwards and not in a, scrubbed all the impurities away, kind of raw. I tried it multiple times and I just wasn't happy with it. Wont be using it again	-1
I cleanse my face daily, as does my husband and we both did not like how this cleanser made our faces feel. I have been using a Clairsonic Mia for the past two years and I still prefer that one over this one. And it is less than half the price of this one. I felt as though the vibration on this one was too intense, my whole head could feel the vibrations. I also felt like my skin wasn't as clean. Like another reviewer said, it's a $200 vibrating piece of silicone. I don't get it. At least with my Clarisonic there are bristles that are getting in the creases around my nose, and doing scrubbing. With the luna I did not feel like i could get the area between my nose and face well without a huge struggle. The way you go about holding this is really weird too. You hold it the same way you would hold a grilled cheese sandwich and it is hard to manuever. I wish I could find something good to say about this, but I really cannot think of anything.	-1
This is way to pricey for what your getting.  This is nothing more than a fancy overpriced hand massage.  The thing is nice for what it does, but for absolute ridiculous price of 169.00 This thing is way over priced.  It is re-chargeable with a usb cord.  The Face brush works, I don't know if it is anti-aging, I think time will tell after I use it for a bit.  But the deal breaker is the pricey price tag that is a deal breaker for me.  I just don't feel it is worth the amount they are charging for this thing.	-1
This Japonesque Kumadori Buffing Brush is a great brush, until you wash it. The brush is a perfect size. The handle is ribbed and comfortable. The bristles are firm, yet very soft. The brush worked well with foundations, bronzers and blushes. The design has a looped end for easy drying after washing it.  The real test of a good quality brush is washing it. After using it for a week with powders, I rinsed it, gently washed it with a drop of mild shampoo, rinsed, towel blotted it, reshaped it and hung it to dry. The next morning, I applied some powder and immediately upon using it, the bristles were falling out all over the place.  I've had cheap brushes where the brush falls apart after a few washings, but this is ridiculous. A brush that cannot survive one gentle wash is a total waste of money. I am surprised that Japonesque would allow a brush this nice to be made this cheap and pass any form of quality control. If I could, I would rate this 0 Stars, as it's a total waste of money.	-1
As a makeup artist, I know how important it is to have good brushes to do the best work.  Not only to you need the brush to perform well, but be durable and stand up to cleaning.  Let's see how the Japonesque Kumadori Countour/Highlight Brush measures up.  WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE? This brush is about 6 1/2" long with the handle being 5" and the brush head 1 1/2" long.  The brush head is about 1 3/8" wide at its widest point.  The shape of the brush is a teardrop shape.  The bristles are natural and they are not at all dense in the way they are packed.  I would put this more in the fluffy category and not dense.  The handle is tapered, but the base seems to be a rubbery base underneath.  A rim of that material is visible up near the base of the brush head.  The rest of the handle is wrapped with a natural piece of what resembles thin wicker.  I am not sure what the actual name of it is.  It is wrapped and glued down with the end tucked up under at the top.  It simply ends at the tip of the handle and is not tucked down.  The surface texture of the wrapped handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate in your hand, although in certain positions it can feel rough.  HOW DOES THIS BRUSH PERFORM? As for performance, this brush does not do too well picking up product from a pan unless the pan of makeup is very very soft and easily picked up.  It does not disperse the product as equally on the skin as I would like.  I have tried this with blush, bronzer and highlighter, but I find that it seems to work best with Guerlain Meteorites.  That is not necessarily a bad thing as Guerlain Meteorites are little balls of product which are in different colors.  It is hard to find a brush which applies them well.  They act more as a highlight or finishing powder in a very subtle manner.  This brush would also work decently with mineral makeup.  The tip makes it get into smaller spaces of the face like around the nose and inner eyes, but is broad enough to use on the rest of the face and under the chin.  I did not find that the bristles were dense or sturdy enough to pick up sufficient product to apply to the skin evenly from pans of color such as contour or highlight.  I tend to get better results from brushes in that same shape but much higher density than this one is.  WHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BRUSH My biggest problem with this brush is that it is not going to be easy to clean.  Brushes are meant to be used and that means they will get dirty.  Sometimes handles will also get dirty.  In the case of this brush, the handle being wrapped by the wicker like pieces, I don't see this brush being easy to clean.  The bristles being wet only is possible, but any moisture at all on this handle is bound to make it come apart eventually.  I imagine if you were to coat the handle with something that would withstand moisture, you could probably still use this brush and it would be more practical.  That way the handle would not unwrap with constant cleaning and you could still enjoy the brush.  THE BOTTOM LINE If used for application of light powdery highlights or contour that is not packed hard in a pan, or sphere powders like Guerlain Meteorites, this brush would be good.  For use where you want to deposit color more evenly from pans of product, it is not the best brush. The composition of the handle makes it not practical to clean as if the handle becomes wet over time, the handle will probably come apart.  It you are a brush collector and love unusual brushes, and the practicality of this does not matter to you, then you might still love this brush.  If you are a practical person who uses their brushes a lot and likes to keep them clean all of the time, this might not be the brush for you.  I have rated this two stars because I feel that it just isn't practical for makeup use that leads to lots of cleaning for that price.	-1
I was really excited about the concept of this product, as I am a powdered dry shampoo user in the interest of saving water, and thought this couch be a nice tool in my product collection, but it is truly awful.  I could see this being POSSIBLY useful for someone with really short hair who wants to skip a wash and have some lift if used JUST in the roots, but even that is hard for me to picture being manageable.  The product is so sticky and grainy that while it does have the effect of removing oil, what's left in your hair is way grosser than oil.  It might look passable, but it feels just terrible, my hairbrush stuck in it and it broke my hair, I couldn't wash it off my hands and after THREE shampoos, I could still feel it in my hair (getting a comb stuck in it), and that was all using a TINY amount, and rubbing it well between my fingers before applying it sparingly.  I used it once and thought it was gross but decided to at least play with it once more before a shower in case I had used too much or hadn't thinned it enough, but no, it was still awful.  As others have said, the smell is nice enough but not overpowering, which is the only nice thing to say about this product.  I am certainly glad this was a review item.. if I had paid the crazy price for this I would be returning it for my money back.	-1
I am a HUGE fan of the R+Co Park Ave Blow Out Balm but this just missed the mark for me. It smells absofrickinglutely delicious as all R+Co products do, and it's a neat idea but once it was in my hair it had way too much texture. I received this as a sample in my latest Birchbox and when I first tried it out I used the smallest amount. Seriously, at the rate I foresee myself using this product it'll be at least 6 months before I run out of the tiny little sample size... It didn't feel terribly gritty when I first applied it but after a few minutes it was like I had assaulted my roots with a bottle of 1980's strength hairspray. I waited a few hours to see if that dissipated but it didn't and my day 2 hair looked pretty gross and greasy which for me, on day 2, is unusual. Maybe my very thick, curly hair just responds better to a finer dry shampoo but either way this just didn't do it for me. If you're looking for loads of texture though this could definitely be for you!	-1
The biggest issue I have with this is that I put it on and my lips started tingling, which is usually a sign of some irritant, and yup: the ingredients include several, from fragrance to linalool and limonene. Irritants, aside from being a bit unpleasant, damage your lips so they don't hold moisture as well, so you reapply, which damages your lips, etc. It's why "medicated" lip balms can be "addictive." My other beef is that the lovely "nude" shade turned a bit pinky-orange after I applied it. It's still a nice shade--just less "nude." On the plus side, the case is gorgeous--a shiny black lacquer that closes magnetically. So cool. Too bad the lipstick is irritating.	-1
Worst mascara I have ever tried. Sticky, wet, clumps lashes and looks bad. Simply bad product.	-1
Glops on brush, smeared and flaked.	-1
Let's begin with the good things about this pencil. -It goes on smoothly, so you don't need to press down too hard. -The spool on the end is fantastic for brushing and shaping eyebrows! I have naturally thin eyebrows, so I can't get them shaped without losing them, and I appreciate a good brush.  Well those are the only good things I have. Moving right along... -The color isn't brown. This is a lie. It's a weird greenish tinted color, which looks completely unnatural, except for maybe on a gargoyle. I could use mascara and have it look better. -I'm not usually so picky, but the packaging is ridiculously difficult to get into. It took my husband and friend helping me to solve the puzzle of how to open this. And a lot of tears and frustration. I thought we lived in the age of frustration free packaging? -This doesn't last for more than a few hours. And this could simply be because I live in the hot and swampy southern US, where we sweat all summer long. However, my Revlon products last just fine, as do Clinique and Lancme. Yep. I think it's just this little pencil. I can't reccomend this at all, as I'm only keeping it for the spool which makes my eyebrows look good. But eyebrow brushes are cheap, and this is not.	-1
Yucky Grey-Green NOT Brown  My heart was set on the usual La Roche-Posay quality in this BROWN eyebrow pencil. The actual color on is a grey with a green cast ...OMG this is the biggest disappointment!  My Wet N Wild $1 BROWN pencils are better.  The sturdy, nice-sized spoolie is the best part of this item.	-1
I don't see any difference in my skin after a month of use. For such a high price tag, you would expect results. The only thing I see is an oilier skin appearance towards the middle of the day. Looks super oily in photos. No negative skin reactions though, which is good. Not recommended for the price.	-1
It's creamy and easy to apply in small amounts, which is what you want for around your eyes.  I've used it for almost 2 weeks and really don't see much of a difference.  It's pricey, so that would be a big disappointment for me.	-1
February 1, 2017 UPDATE: The battery, even when it has been charged completely, no longer holds the charge and the unit stops after only a few seconds.  Poor product when it lasts less than a year.  Attractive and easy-to-hold, the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush, White/Silver is as effective as it is lovely.  The slender, ergonomic shape allows you to hold this cleansing brush without slipping from your hand, even when it is wet.  Three different heads provide different options from cleansing your skin  one for regular cleansing, one to massage your skin, and one for sensitive skin.  Because I have sensitive skin, I love the specific head for that skin-type.  It does not irritate or cause abrasions on my skin  this is a definite plus.  It helps remove my make-up completely and leaves my skin feeling invigorated.  Individuals who can use the regular head or massage head will find these do an excellent job cleansing their face.  While the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush charges, a blue strobe-like light initially rotates around the brush head; it then glows steadily during the charging phase and goes out when the unit is fully charged.  The initial charge takes about six hours and lasts for 30 uses.  Three cleansing speeds provide additional options for your facial cleansing routine.  An additional plus is that you can use this cleansing brush while you are in the shower as long as you do not immerse in completely.  If you are looking for an excellent facial cleansing brush, I recommend the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush, White/Silver.	-1
I'm surprised that so many people think this cleanser smells good. I guess I'm in the minority. I think it smells very antiseptic. Like the stereotypical old lady smell. I don't care for it. Others have mentioned their skin felt tighter. Mine just felt dryer and slightly irritated. It's definitely not the cleanser for me.	-1
Packaged in a two-part dispenser that reminded me of the epoxy dual-dispensers in my husband's shop - two chemicals are dispensed at the same time and in the correct proportions for the product to work as it should - "ELEMIS Biotech Skin Energising, Day Cream" may do everything the manufacturer claims it will - if the dispenser actually worked.  Once I was able to open the extremely secure top, when I pumped it twice as directed I got a nice amount of cream but the oil component dribbled down the side of the bottle.  Because I was never able to get any oil into my hand to mix with the cream component, I used the cream alone.  It made my skin feel soft and smooth - and it was an excellent base for my makeup.  ELEMIS needs to make significant improvements in the dispenser in which they are packaging this Day Cream.  If they do not, regardless of how well the Day Cream works when mixed in the proper proportions, as currently packaged and dispensed the price of this product is not justified.	-1
Nice pouch. Everything, even the clippers, is flat enough to keep in a breast pocket if you want to carry it there. The tweezers are especially nice and have good grasp. Heavy duty file. Clippers are a little hard to figure out how to open and close them, although my husband had no problem, but he said they were "not worth a damn." Functionality was sacrificed to design. In order to get them to be flat as possible, you can only open them so wide and they do not cut male nails very well at all. Useless. The price is prohibitive for just two out of three good utensils. For a high-end traveler, easy to pack, although not sure if you could get these past the screening process on a plane in carry-on luggage. Do not recommend. Also, do men really like red cases?	-1
On first inspection, this set appears really nice. The leather pouch is especially nice - honestly, I would love a wallet made of this stuff. The kit fits in my handbag pocket discreetly and that makes it very handy. The nail file is easy to hold and doesn't slip out my fingers, it shapes and smooths natural nails correctly. The tweezers are well designed and easy to use - again they don't slip out of my fingers and the little plastic cap keeps them closed so you don't poke yourself pulling them out of the pouch.  The failure here is the weak nail clippers. They fold flat to fit in the pouch, but that is a prime example of design over function. Unfolding the clippers to use them means the hinge for the clipping action is small and weak and easily bumped loose during use. If you use these just for a quick hang nail or to snip a loose thread they are fine. To actually do your fingernails or toe nails, these clippers are an exercise in frustration. I ended up getting out my dollar store nail clippers instead. If you can find this set for under fifteen bucks it's worth it, but that's just because the leather case and tweezer are really good.	-1
I really like a similar product from the same brand that comes in a pump, that is just used to get that extra layer of yucky in his off after changing a really dirty diaper. I thought that this was going to be a really similar product, that I could just spray it on to my baby and wipe her down really quickly, kind of like baby Windex. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, this actually stings my baby's skin! When I use the pump product on her, there's absolutely no complaint, but when I use this, even if I spray it on to the washcloth in an area where she can't see me doing it, as soon as it touches her skin she starts complaining. It is also very highly fragranced, much more so than some of the other products from this line. This was a total miss for me and my baby. The one thing that I really liked was the idea of it and the very fine spray. But unfortunately the actual solution was a little strong.	-1
If you are in the market for baby perfume with a slight emollient to make skin or hair slick, this is the product for you. Not for me. I like unscented products, like the Mustela Stelatopia moisturizing cream.  The marketing for this product is misleading: This is primarily a cologne. It's like they mixed cologne and water and a little moisturizing creme, and then gave it a hefty price tag. It's feel is similar to that of the leave-on waterless soaps.	-1
This gel does leave your skin feeling clean, but the smell is hard to get past. It's hard to imagine why this off-putting scent was added to a product like this. I used it on my own skin, but will pass on using it on one of the kids in our family.	-1
I tried this on my own skin first.  Yes, its gentle & left my skin feeling soft.  But I hated the scent.  It has a white musk scent that actually makes me nauseous.  I cant stand musk scents.  And it lingers.  I had to scrub with another soap to get rid of the scent on my skin.  If you like the scent, this is a really good cleansing gel. Why put fragrance in a baby/sensitive skin product?!	-1
Ok, so I'll be honest, I didn't expect to dislike this quite so much...it looked so pretty in its package!  But I think if all eye shadows were packaged in identical plain packages, you'd guess this was a cheap drug store brand.  The 4 colors are: "Time to un-wine" -- (darkest shade in the lower right corner) -- looks as though it'll be a deep, darker brown with win undertones.  In reality it is a much lighter reddish brown, which (like all the colors) doesn't last at all, and the reddish coloring can make your eyes look a bit tired and bloodshot. "Mink it over" -- (lower left corner, taupe color) -- the best color of the 4, it is a decent frosty taupe, which can be used on a large area of the eyelid without being overpowering.  But like the other colors, it lacks enough pigment to last, and you need to use a lot of it to get it to show up.  It also doesn't look right with the darker "time to un-wine" shade (because that shade is too red and not dark enough). "Frost & found" -- (light peachy shade, upper left corner) -- I can't get this color to actually show up at all on my (fair) skin -- I can only see the frostiness of it in the light.  But it doesn't provide any pigment to even out my skin tone underneath, so it tends to look like I've just used a transparent frosting powder or something. "Tickle me pink" -- (light pink in upper right corner) -- I hoped this would be a rosy color, adding some depth, some blushy tones.  However, it is merely a super light frosty pale, pale pink -- almost white.  Like the eye shadow you give a tween girl for her first eyeshadow.  It's ok if that's what you want -- but again, like the others it's not heavily pigmented (or even medium pigmented!), so you have to use a lot of it to really get coverage.  (And I'm fair skinned, so it shouldn't take much...)  Overall, I'm just not impressed.  These shadows are just overpriced, put in a sleek box (which, FYI, doesn't include any applicator), and seem no better than Wet and Wild or Cover Girl...save your money.  They're not pigmented nearly enough to show up (even on fair skin).  The four colors don't even look particularly nice with each other...I don't understand this palette at all!  The colors only seem to coordinate in the package, but on the face they don't coordinate well at all.  The only color I kind of like is the "mink it over," but even that can't hold a candle to several of the Urban Decay Naked2 colors (that's actually the one I'd recommend for this nude type palette, it's awesome).  On a side note, the funniest part of this is the packaging (I didn't subtract a star for this, I'm just mentioning it).  It's made to look sleek and high-end, except...it's nearly impossible to open!  It snaps closed too tight, and there's no way to grip it to open it...it's a struggle every time.  I actually have to put a tab of duct tape on the edge just to get it open, because it's so badly designed...tr&eacute;s chic.  ;-)	-1
"Natural" would be the perfect color if you were an Oompa Loompa.  It has a very orange cast to it which doesn't work for my pale to fair skin tone.  I'm not sure it will work well for anyone, Ooompa Loompas excluded. The coverage is definitely buildable, the powder is finely milled, and if it were a wearable color, it would be great. The included application sponge is of average drugstore quality. The packaging is a little odd. The mirrored case gets covered with fingerprints very easily and therefore looks messy.  There is a clear plastic cover inside that hinges off of the powder that is awkward and feels flimsy.  I can't recommend this product.	-1
Would love to know how this product works but can't even get it out of the bottle.  There's an arrow that you are supposed to line up with "on" for open and "off" for closed.  That didn't work.  Tried aligning the arrow with "off" in case the bottle was assembled wrong.  That didn't work either.  Went online and asked if anyone else had a problem with the bottle.  Another user with the same issue said to try turning the top only half way.  That didn't work.  My husband tried using brut force and eventually got the product to squirt out all over the counter, breaking the twist cap, or so we thought.  I tried squeezing the bottle, but no matter which way I turned the top I couldn't get the product to come out.  After thing for several more minutes, I just gave up.  Then, 2 drops oozed out on the counter.  I dabbed those on my face and the postage stamp size area did feel soft and smooth but when I tried to get more product out of the bottle, it stopped working yet again.  I give up!	-1
I am a fan of the new liquid eyeliners (well, new relative to the old ones; this type has been around for a number of years). It's like using a very fine, tapering felt tip marker to easily achieve either a very thin line, perfect for tight-lining, or you can make a thicker line and even feather it out if you so desire. It works well, lasts well, doesn't smear, smudge or raccoon eye. Why the poor rating? It arrived virtually dried out, and the price is outrageous, considering it was made in China! It is higher than the Japanese brands. Worse, the Bliss company couldn't have been less helpful in rectifying this problem. Avoid - there are so many better lines out there, especially at the high price point.	-1
This review is for the color Nude. I don't like it; I wanted Buff. I don't like the modified eyedropper either or the finish on my skin. Although the bottle is very pretty with a striking chrome top and stylish lettering, the system is clunky and wasteful. The chrome top screws off to reveal an eyedropper-like tube running through the middle of the bottle. The chrome top has a button that can be depressed to pick up or release drops of foundation from the eyedropper tube (much as a standard eyedropper's rubber bulb is pressed). If it were possible to keep the tube clean and only get the foundation inside the tube, the system might work. But the tube itself gets thickly coated with foundation that impedes efficient dropping at the eyedropper's end. The entire tube quickly gets glopped up with thickened foundation.  As the foundation came out of the dropper, I saw that the color (Nude) was an odd pinky gold that looked extremely artificial when dabbed on my light skin. The oddness of the color dissipated a lot as I spread it, but it never looked right on me. The Buff probably would have been better. But the texture was unworkable for me. It would not spread smoothly even though I prepared my skin with moisturizer and primer. I tried it a second time with moisturizer, no primer, and had even more of a problem. Finally, I tried it with a lot of moisturizer and that was the best. Still, my fine lines were emphasized by the foundation, which became dry and almost powdery as it set. My older skin looked even older by the time my makeup was finished. And it had almost a chalky look. I immediately washed it off and will not use it again.	-1
Usually, I don't care about the packaging of a cosmetic-it's what inside that counts-but this is the worst packaging I have ever encountered in over 20 years of wearing make-up. Specifically, it's got a weird sort of design where you're supposed to unscrew the cap and pump out the foundation. However, in my product, the tube was bent out of shape and due to being tossed around in the mail, a ton of foundation managed to pool up in the cap. What a waste! Also, this stuff is very thick and doesn't wash off easy-probably due to the high concentration of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Even with repeated washings of hot soapy water, it stayed on my hands and on the bottle-and this is before I ever applied it to my face!  When I finally put it on, it was okay. It was thicker and darker than I expected although it was not nearly as dark once I applied it to my face. It is a decent, medium to full coverage foundation with a good SPF but that is all. It's nothing great and the horrible packaging is a drawback.  I got this as freebie, so I am not out any money. However, if I had paid for this, I would ask for a refund.	-1
I really need to start checking product ingredients before I commit to reviewing the item. bliss Get Set & Go Makeup Setting Spray lists the following: Denatured alcohol comes first, Dimethyl ether is next, which may the the propellent. The third ingredient is Butane. IF that isn't enough to stop you, the rest of the list contains Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Kaolin, Dimethicone, Isopentyldiol, Isododecane, Hexylene Glycol, Perfluorononyl Dimethicone, PPG-3 Benzyl Ether Myristate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, PEG-9 Dimethicone/PEG-9 Olive Phosphate, Acrylates/Steareth-20 Methacrylate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol.  I first sprayed the Get Set & Go Makeup Setting Spray on my hand, to make sure it wasn't going to irritate my skin. I then planned to dab a bit on a spot on my face, before spraying on a face full. The smell of alcohol was so strong, I read the list of ingredients. If having alcohol as a first ingredient isn't enough, the Butane certainly was.  I do set my makeup, because I have dry skin, and I find that a quick spray makes my makeup look more natural, less dry and made up. I use a spray I make out of filtered water and essential oil. That is what I will continue to use. That works great for me. Testing the bliss was a whim, as I have found some great beauty products and make up here at Amazon. I just can't imagine spraying this on my face, even once, never mind on a frequent basis.	-1
I am puzzled that this contains butaine which aside from gasoline or pepper spray is one of the  last things I want to be spraying on my face. I have asthma.  I took a look at the ingredients and tossed this out.  I don't have an objection to alcohol in products as I use rubbing alcohol and also many cosmetics use a moisturizing type of alcohol but butaine which is highly flammable on the face is not ok.  They could have put this in a pump spray bottle, and I suppose any type of propellant ingredient would be a problem if sprayed on the face, but lighter fluid applied to my face, when I sometimes use a hot straightening iron on my bangs, sounds like a horror movie.	-1
When I checked the ingredients on this bottle, I was shocked as denatured alcohol is the first but Butane is the third ingredients. From typing it into Google it brought up this - "Butane is regarded as one of the more harmful volatile substances to inhale. Butane gas can cause what is known as 'sudden sniffing death', which occurs as a result of cardiac arrhythmia/arrest if the person is stressed or does heavy exercise during or soon after using." On reading more websites, it's not too harmful in small quantities at normal temperatures but in higher temperatures or closed spaces it can cause much harm. I only use these type of sprays in hot and humid climates and it seems like a butane product can do most damage in those conditions.  It's also pretty expensive compared to some other more natural products that I've tried. There is a rosewater based spray that is very beneficial for you&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mario-Badescu-Facial-Spray-with-Aloe-Herbs-and-Rosewater/dp/B00OP2RAZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater</a>&nbsp;and is priced very well. It does not set the makeup like some other sprays but it's a nice spray to keep the makeup looking fresh and new. I cannot recommend this product due to its ingredients.  In terms of setting makeup, it does a moderate job. For a good makeup setting spray most users recommend the UD All Nighter setting spray that does not let the makeup budge and is cheaper than this product per ounce. Many showgirls have recommended it too, and it does not seem to contain butane. It keeps makeup on even in hot and humid conditions, with this spray, the makeup tends to start fading.	-1
I don't usually give just one star because it was not B A D.  So these two stars are because of these negatives:  1)  I could detect no scent and thought there would be; 2)  I thought the price was prohibitive based on the small can; 3) The ingredients really blew me away.... Butane, come on! Maybe I shall try to learn more about the properties of Butane but even if I did, I don't think I want it on my face.  On the positive side, I used my hand as my face, using the moisturizer, foundation, blush, lipstick and eyeshadow normally used.  I did not wash the back of this hand for the 8 hours a person generally works and at the end of that period, the makeup still looked good on the back of my hand. Yes, I know the skin is different on my hand but the makeup would be the same.  I would buy this product if the ingredients were changed but maybe if they were, then the setting wouldn't be the same.	-1
I do not see the need for this product. It contains a bunch of chemicals you are supposed to spray on your face to "set" your makeup. It makes your makeup last for a long time. I am not sure it actually does that -- my makeup situation at the end of the day was the same as always.  Here are my layers: I like powder on top of foundation on top of moisturizer. Maybe I will dab on eye cream or serum sometimes. But I don't need need this layer of chemicals on top. It doesn't seem to do anything.  If you feel you need setting spray, there are other formulas that contain herbs and healthier ingredients than this.	-1
I have average skin, not pale, not dark.  I'm what the ladies and gentlemen at Sephora call "a perfect candidate" for bronzer. They showed me repeatedly what a great benefit it would be to make me look, healthy, sunny (without skin cancer danger) and even slimmer!  Yep, the trifecta of goodness.  But it doesn't. Some bronzers are okay (the Bare Escentuals light one seems okay) but the rest make me feel like my face is dirty.  Even just a light dusting feels like I'm sprinkling dirt on my face.  So I eagerly tried this, because if it makes me one pound slimmer it's a win, right?  No.  It just felt like dirt. Something about the texture, no matter how much I blended, felt like I had a sticky powder on my face.  It is heavy on the pigment and not easy to blend in the first place.  But even when I had a friend put it on me, it just stuck out as "OMG that lady must have been downwind of a factory explosion!!!!".  I don't know if it's me or Bliss (I like their other products immensely). Maybe it's me, but my friend tried it too, her with a darker complexion, Neither of us was happy.  Try to sample before buying.  Although I'm sure Amazon would accept a return.	-1
Came in broken. The bottle was cracked and leaking and there was no tube to reach to the bottom.	-1
Of note: I do not have sensitive skin and Ive never had a problem with moiturizers or acne creams in the past. One application of a small amount of this on my forehead yielded an almost immediate burning sensation that intensified rapidly. Wiping it off revealed reddened skin. This might be a fluke, but I won't be using it again.	-1
Whats the uniqueness? I sadly got two pimples a while after this came in. I had used it on another pimple and didn't see anything so great about it, but thought what the heck lets be all sciency. So my loss was your gain. After 5 days of using both this and a generic brand 5% BP there was not noticeable difference. My gf thought this product might have moisturized more but the results sure didn't show it. Also worth noting Neutrogena makes a formula which 25% BP if you really need acne taken care of. Maybe this has some ingredients that make it more effective or more worthwhile but not for my skin.  Also just because they are in dermatologists office doesnt instill much confidence the product for me. I went to dermatologist in Beverly Hills because my insurance covered it. The guy had no idea what was causing a rash on my face or why it would peal he through everything and the kitchen sink at it and said: we don't really know why this happens but lets see if it works. Also he tried 3 different products on my dark circles under my eyes and none of them worked-- I was not bothered at all by them but he insisted--because guess what he has his own very successful beauty line. I was clearly not his usual clientelle. Once he left the room and his PA said I could get literally the same products minus an ingredient or two that had no appreciable clinical effect mostly OTC. I'm sure there are ancient or homeopathic ingredients that would make a difference in some products. It just seems these doctors have no inclination to actually research it. They just find a sales angle and go with it.	-1
The active ingredient in this product is benzoyl peroxide. The same benzoyl peroxide that I've been using for 40 years. The same benzoyl peroxide that you can find on any drug store shelf for around $5-$10. So what makes this product worth $81? Nothing.  This is a light lotion that goes on very smoothly, but it is SHINY. It's not greasy but it shines, shines, shines. I used it at bedtime and when I woke up, I had a face full of clogged pores. Not pimples or an inflammatory response, but something squeezable. I was so shocked and very annoyed. Wasn't about to use it again.  For a great (and more affordable) acne treatment, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/La-Roche-Posay-Effaclar-Duo-Dual-Action-Acne-Treatment-Cream-with-Benzoyl-Peroxide-Oil-Free-1-35-Fl-Oz/dp/B004L8J15C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment Cream with Benzoyl Peroxide, Oil-Free, 1.35 Fl. Oz.</a>. Not only does it contain benzoyl peroxide, but it also has micro-exfoliating lha-lipo hydroxy acid. For me, this cleared my skin of every blackhead, something no over product has ever done. At my last visit, my dermatologist even exclaimed, "You don't have a single blackhead!"	-1
I was looking forward to using this product.  I am 52 and Caucasian, but I still breakout once a month.  I was also sick over the holiday and my skin was dry.  I was drinking a lot water and moisturizing regularly and I still had a bad reaction to the cream.  First, for $80 bucks, youd think the person boxing the product would make sure there was a straw in the box.  The top of the bottle has to be removed and replaced with a pump with straw.  I double-checked the envelop, the box, and my kitchen and bathroom floors; no straw.  I took the bottle and got some in my palm.  I was planning to put it on a few minutes before my shower and let the benzoyl peroxide kill germs in my problem areas and rinse off, as not to dry out my face.  Oh no.  It burned.  I quickly got undressed and jumped in the shower and rinsed it off.  Even after I got out of the tub, my skin was still irritated.  I had to cool it off will some cooling face cream.  This whole experience did surprise me because I have been using 10% benzoyl peroxide for years.  This was only 5%.  Very disappointed.	-1
The main ingredients are water and alcohol - with a list of chemicals at least a couple of inches long, including fragrance, which can include just about anything... mostly harmful to health. The Restoring Mist does include some natural ingredients that are generally helpful. Maybe if they got rid of the artificial chemicals and kept the natural if might be a product worth considering.  Is it refreshing? Yes, the nozzle puts out a fine mist, which can be something of a wake-up call, although I don't care for the smell.  The nice little bottle is reusable. I dumped out the contents in favor of vitamin C crystals dissolved in green tea. I found it equally refreshing, without the stink. Try 1 tsp. vitamin C powder to 9 tsp. green tea. It should last about a weak before the vitamin C breaks down. If you use a clear bottle, the vitamin C will break down quicker.

who thinks this is a silly product?  I ordered this through vine, because for one thing  it didn't cost me anything and yes, I was curious enough.  But honestly, I didn't feel (or look) any more radiant, toned or hydrated. The only things I felt were silly for spritzing my face and neck with this slightly sticky feeling, citrus smelling water and grateful that I didn't spend any money on it.  Would I recommend?  NO.	-1
I've got this box before, and it was much better. As this one goes, it's terrible. Single use packets are of no value to me.  I have to try something more than once to be motivated to spend big money on the full size. So I was so shocked at how lousy this one was.  In addition, the credit I've been given is 99 cents and not $19.99. I'm contacting them to no resolution. I'd really like to buy something from the luxury department with the correct credit.	-1
Don't buy this! Mostly perfume samples, and if, like me, you never get the promised credit, you're out $20 for samples you wouldn't take for free.	-1
Too much glitter, don't like the way it applies or looks.  Just not for me	-1
The WARM color is  beige !! Not at all like the picture on the package !! 51 $ for that really doesnt worst it ,,,, not for tan skins	-1
I wish I loved this cream--it's a little bit on the greasy side, and has an off-putting (to me)artificial fragrance I've smelled in other creams before--and I can't handle the smell, although my husband is ok with it. I don't like the way it feels on my skin enough to overcome the fragrance. It just doesn't smell pleasant to me. It's beautifully packaged, but I can't get past the smell of it. If this is a cedar smell, I don't like it. I'd love it if it was more of  an orange/citrus smell, or orange blossom, but it is most definitely neither of those. And honestly, I don't get a cedar fragrance either--more of a generic artificial perfume.	-1
I was very disappointed with this product. When I opened the lid, it had separated and there was basically a pool of oil on the bottom and some pink jagged chunks on the sides. It scratched my skin (not in a good exfoliating way but in a painful way) and the smell, which is weird, is lingering on my arms two hours later. For $29 (cost of this product), you could roll around in the sand at the beach (less painful), rinse off in the ocean (for the salt experience), pay for parking, and still have some money left for an ice cream---and it would be a lot more enjoyable. I won't purchase this in the future.	-1
I figured this would smell like real, nature orange and cedar, but it absolutely does not! Yuck, it is very perfumey, fake-o smelling. I think if they would have used real essential oils it could have been much nicer. I didn't use it because I didn't want to reek of perfume!  I think the ingredients are very good, except the perfume. I have found making my own satisfies me the most. Just take sugar and coconut oil, mix and add my own essential oils.  As a Amazon Vine reviewer, I receive this product for free and provided my honest opionion of the product.	-1
I am suspicious of this product. I have followed Ayurvedic practices for awhile and central to Ayurveda is determining one's dosha. Is this for pittas? Vadas? Kaphas? Is it tri-doshic? Or, is the manufacturer capitalizing on the popularity of Ayurveda and using conventional perfume making ingredients with a "natural" scent? It does not smell natural at all, but like a commercial perfume. A quick look at the Rituals site reveals that the Ayurveda line is only one of six scent lines, all with an Eastern theme. One of the ingredients, cyclohexene, is on OSHA hazard lists. It does contain some natural ingredients, but since Ayurveda is about balancing your energy naturally, why spray yourself with a mist created in a chemist's lab? Be your own advocate and if you're attracted to Ayurveda, don't fall prey to slick marketing tactics supported by pretty prose and photographs. Keep it simple, keep it natural.	-1
For a product marketed as Ayurvedic, Im surprised by the ingredients.  That aside, I don't enjoy this fragrance at all.  I love rose and use a natural rosewater daily.  The rose component of this reminds me of old dusty bathroom potpourri.  I don't detect any of the honey but it does also smell faintly of a mosquito candle.  Within minutes of putting this on my body I had a headache.  I sprayed it in a room and it is a bit better but, to me, is really only appropriate for a bathroom spray.  Scents, of course, are a matter of personal preference.  The product is a good quantity and comes in a nice glass bottle.	-1
It's not look good if you have any wrinkles in your lips.  Also for darker skin tone	-1
I have had this product before and I can tell you that it is fantastic.  It's the seller that I'm pissed at here.  This was supposed to be a present for my mother to help convince her to stop using the sun to tan.  When this arrived, it was missing the turquoise top, which leads me to believe that this product was used.  It didn't even have a broken top.  That I could have believed and understood. I had a very difficult and embarrassing time trying to explain to my mom that this was still safe to use even though it had obviously been tampered with.	-1
I really wanted to like this brush, I truly did. However, the truth is that my daughter and I both dislike it, and she has long straight hair and I have short, curly hair.  Here's why~ 1. It's bulky and heavy and just seems it would be easier to use if it was much lighter. 2. The bristles are stiff and hard and the design just doesn't seem to hold the hair in place to do a good job. 3. Even though there's a lock button, I still have a hard time using the buttons and their placement isn't the best. Keep hitting them while in use. 4. It doesn't smooth our hair as it shows in the video/pics. Nothing close.  I wouldn't recommend it, sorry.	-1
When this serum came in the mail, I was really hoping it would keep my skin moist in the winter.  The first thing I really liked about it was that there are little pods of serum that are more sterile than dipping your hand in a jar every night.  I found them easy to open with a pinch of my nail.  That is pretty much the only positive thing about it.  I was not happy on how it works and I don't know why or how Cindy Crawford can look so good at her age only using this product.  While it goes on fine under make-up, it really did nothing for me.  I am 52 and Caucasian.  I know there is no magical cream or serum that will erase already existing lines, but I do want to prevent lines and have existing ones less noticeable.  I used the serum twice a day for nine days and I think my skin looks older.  I am drinking plenty of water and the lines on my forehead are now more pronounced.  It just did not work for me.	-1
I was not terribly impressed.  This product did not really do anything to enhance my curls, and it certainly did not help tame the frizz.  I think I would pass on this one.	-1
This device is very similar in apperance to Veet Silk product, which I wanted to try for facial hair removal, but was unable to because Veet Silk specifically said not to use it on the face.  I was surprised to see that this device being practically identical to Veet Silk said it was OK to use on the face but be careful not to flash the bright IPL light into eyes.  Even marketing images on the box are the same on these two products.  So I tried it on the face and immediately encountered problems with the light not flashing because the safety sensor cannot be fully covered due to the curvature of the face.  For example, I was unable to make this device flash in the middle of my upper lip right under the nose.  The center part of the sensor is flush against the skin, but the ends are not, so the light won't flash.  I am looking for a device that won't leave me with a Hitler mustache.  It is easy to use on flat skin surfaces like legs, arms, legs, or cheeks, and it fits comfortably in hand.  However, I wanted this device specifically for use on my face but it does not seem to work well on all areas of that part of my body.	-1
I really should have gone to the store rather than trusting how colors would translate from online to in person.  Since I'm a fan of butter London, it seemed like a safe gamble.  Wow was I wrong.  The color Dahling (such a fun name, like all their colors) looks *nothing* like the photo.  I thought it was going to be a delicious medium sherberty pink and it's actually rather dowdy,  a matronly mauvey pink.  Sad.	-1
Very disappointed. It may be 7-free but it's rated a "6" on EWG. Ugh! I was going to go back to Essie (rated a 5 with EWG Skin Deep) but will try Zoya (5-free) because of all the good things I read about it. It was 1 of only 2 out of the 12 nail polishes tested that were really free of the toxic chemicals they claimed.	-1
Wears off and chips easily - lasts about 2 days.	-1
Too thick to apply properly.  Wouldn't buy again.	-1
These polishes are expensive and too thin for the color to pop. I bought several because the colors are so beautiful but have returned to old faithful OPI.	-1
I was so excited to pick out my very first bottle of Butter 3-free nail polish. There were many gorgeous colors to choose from. I chose this one (Kerfuffle)...and I wish I hadn't. It didn't go on very nicely. It was obvious I couldn't even possibly get by temporarily with one coat. But mostly it reminds me of a colored "White-Out" I used years ago at my job. Every time I look down at my toes, I cringe because it's obvious I won't be happy until I remove it and put something else on.  I would be willing to try another color by this brand, but I can't recommend this one.	-1
I bought this brand of polish because of the healthier ingredients. I also bought the base and top coats by Butter London ($29.99 for both) and followed exact instructions. I used a base coat, 2 coats of polish and top coat. Less than 24 hours later, it's chipped dramatically all over. Unfortunately, I can't return these products because of Amazon's return policy of hazardous materials i.e. nail polish.	-1
See description above. The London Butter nail lacquer that I purchased from their company is 100% fantastic!!  But, the London Butter nail lacquer that I purchased  from Shop Adorn was disgusting!!	-1
I loved the color of this nail polish when I first bought it.  However, after applying two coats it was a disastrous mess.  The ending result was thick, streaky and looked as if I applied 5 coats.  When dried it was so unattractive, it had to be removed straight away.  Not worth $14.00!	-1
I bought three different colors of this dreamy looking nail polish and used them as stocking stuffers (including my own!)  The sheen is lovely, but the polish chips easily, and can't be worn without a topcoat, as even two coats won't stand up to normal wear and tear for even a day.	-1
I could smell the perfume as soon as I grab the package out of the mailbox. When I opened up the package, a huge waft of perfume came out. It gave me an instant migraine headache. There is no way that I can use this. If you have allergies, sensitive skin or are sensitive to scents, this is not for you.	-1
Here are some thoughts on my overall experience with this product:  1.) The delivery system is less than ideal. Dipping one's finger into a jar repeatedly encourages contamination. A pump bottle is a better choice since it is a bit more sanitary ... likewise, for a dropper system. So, one has to keep a closer watch on this jar than one would with a dropper or pump bottle. Any change in consistency or odor and one should dispose of it promptly (especially since it is applied to the delicate eye area). So, while the jar may be cosmetically lovely in one's cabinet, it is not the best choice.  2.) The scent is pervasive. One notices it when one opens the jar and removes the seal ... it seems tolerable (similar to a very strong raw shea butter). But the scent does not dissipate. Thirty minutes later, it's still there. An hour later, when I turned my head, I could literally still smell it. I doubt that it's an added fragrance (one probably would not elect to add this scent), so it may be organic to the product itself. Nonetheless, it does wear on one. And those sensitive or allergic to fragrances may find themselves unable to use this product ... just proceed with caution.  3.) While I was able to pat it under my eyes, and it seemed to be absorbed into my skin, I later went to remove my contacts, and it just rolled up in little balls with a mere touch. So, I would advise not to touch the area after application (and to avoid side-sleep because the same happened with my pillow-cases).  Rather than trying trendy cremes with pearl dust, gold flakes, or truffles, simply try a retinoid ... they are the gold standard (and they have nearly no  scent. Bonus).	-1
These simply do not work for removing eye makeup that I've been able to remove successfully with inexpensive Neutrogena face wash for many years. I never use waterproof eye makeup, and I never have trouble washing off any of my makeup at the end of the day with a simple, 30-second washing. These expensive cloths by Skyn Iceland were almost completely ineffective. The only makeup they successfully removed without rubbing, continuous wiping, and a real struggle was my tinted foundation. They left my skin feeling tight, strange, un-cleansed. Imhad to always follow with my regular face wash. I had high hopes for a product I could use in a hurry or take to the gym. These did not deliver.	-1
Big disappointment. The dots adhere to skin superbly. They stick on and stay on through sleeping or a sweaty workout. They peel off gently, too. That's all great but they don't reduce blemish size which is what they're for. The spots I treated even got worse as if there was no medicine on at all (I'm not saying they got worse because of the dots but just that the dots do not treat them). These stick on great, as I said before, and they protect the spot by covering it but they don't shrink blemishes so they were a waste of money. Better off applying a salicylic acid gel and a bandaid.	-1
I have never considered myself as someone who has sensitive skin, but this product and my skin did not get along.  I followed the directions as written on the bottle and less than an hour after the first application I could feel the irritation on my skin; a little itchy and warm.  Because I thought it might be a case of "no pain, no gain" I applied it that evening and received the same results, but a bit more intense. I ended up having to wash my face again and applying a anti-inch moisturizer to allow me to sleep.  Because I don't know what was causing the reaction I won't say that this won't work for others, but I am unable to give it more than two starts as "I don't like it."	-1
Full disclosure: I have only used this straightener one time (so far) and only to straighten, not to attempt curling. If any aspect of my review changes or issues arise, I will edit more review to reflect the additional information.  EDIT: I hadn't used this straightener in a few weeks and, when I attempted to turn it on, it no longer worked. Will be throwing out and getting something different.  First, and perhaps not so important, this straighter does have a sleek look. It's lightweight and narrow, unlike some of the bulky straighteners I've owned in the past. This is a plus as it takes up less counter space and isn't an eyesore.  There is one button that controls on/off and the temperature of the device. Holding down the button turns it on/off, while double clicking allows for temperature control. Above the button there is a series of lights that change depending on the temperature and indicate that the straighter is heating vs ready to use. While, as far as I can tell, this type of control set-up does work, the different temperatures are not noted on the device. I use the same temp every time, so this doesn't affect me as much, but, if you might need to adjust the heat, you'll have to check the instructions pamphlet for temp ranges.  I have admittedly thin hair, but it is naturally curly. I had no problem straightening the majority with only one pass, but some of the more finicky bits, like my bedhead bangs, took a bit more finesse.  As a plus, this straightener did come with two hair clips to divide and twist up hair when straightening. I usually use bobby pins, which I constantly lose, so this was a nice bonus!	-1
I can't help but wonder after glancing at the other stellar reviews: "Did I get a bad one?" I was very disappointed in this product. The packaging and the product are no where near what was expected for this high price tag iron, and its performance was poor on my hair.  The iron does heat up in about 2 minutes, but for my curly, thick locks - taking small sections - it took multiple passes with the iron to get the job done. I have used many professional quality irons; most less expensive than this one, that successfully did complete 'one pass' straightening, but this one did not.  NOTE:  One pass indicates constant heat is maintained throughout the iron while in use.  The T3's build quality isn't as expected either. The overall feel is one of lightweight plastic - cheap feeling - and again, very disappointing.  The good things I can say about this product: the swivel cord is of a good length and my hair moves smoothly across the heated plates. The one push on/off with blue LEDs to indicate when the iron is heated up are simple to view and use.  For the high asking price of this iron I was expecting the sort of performance my stylist's iron produces in the salon. I would have been happy if it had been on par with my other irons: HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron and the Remington S9110S T|Studio Thermaluxe Slim Hair Straightener which both tend to run in the thirty to forty dollar range and work 100% better than this T3.  Maybe I got a bad one?  It makes me sad that this iron didn't live up to its hype, but I cannot recommend this item to others.	-1
The scent just doesn't work for me. I'd describe it like this: Take a pan of freshly prepared caramel, drizzle on a large helping of imitation vanilla, and then spritz with dollar store musk cologne. It doesn't smell very bad, but as others have noted, it does end up smelling like a cheap candle- one of those bath store candles aimed at women with a name like "Summer Mood" that doesn't actually describe any known smell in the universe.  So what you get is a container of mostly oversweet vanilla with undertones of cheap "manly" smells. If this was merely the first draft, as though these really were alcohol distillers and the first batch came out badly, then I'd say it has promise. As is I think this product is probably stuck where it is, so I'm not impressed.  The bath soap lathers just fine, but does NOT rinse well. The smell and an oily sensation clung to my body to the point that I wasn't sure when I would be done rinsing. So again, it feels cheap.  If this was something you could pick up at a dollar store, it might be a neat "masculine" gift. As it's not something I'd recommend unless you're buying it for the Axe crowd who aren't very discerning with scents to begin with. It certainly doesn't live up to its packaging.	-1
I am not particularly fascinated with the sweet tobacco fragrance of this body wash. Although the gel is both a fortified shampoo and body wash and does the dual job, but doesnt have the extra appeal to it either in terms of smell or nourishing the skin. It does not produces enough lather. I have used many brands of body washes over the year such as; Dove Men, Nivea Men, Old Spice, Irish Spring, etc. And I am perfectly happy with any of the last four products.	-1
Ugh.  I was excited to try this product only to discover that it was loaded with tiny blue plastic "micro-beads" which are wrecking the environment!  The smell is inoffensive, mildly reminiscent of lemon-lime, and it definitely left my skin feeling clean and soft...but the environmental cost of using microbeads is simply not worth it.	-1
Meh... not for me. A) the smell IS ok but kinda piney in a way to me.. B) i spray some on my hands and go to wipe it in and my hands absorbed most of it lol... so i had to use alot more. C) per friends, the ph of my skin is NOT a good mix with something in here. i know for sure that "baby lotion" (that johnson n johnsons in a pink bottle for instance) doesnt mesh well... it turns my skin smelling to pukey fish. no joke! Colognes and lotions i can use, but i haven't the foggiest what type of ingredient(s) don't work with the ph of my skin. but, fishy moldy musky pukey smell isn't for me n the ladies..	-1
V76 Vaughn Tex Texture Paste is kind of a mixed bag.  It works really well in providing texture but other than that it comes with some drawbacks.  As others have mentioned, it does have a strange smell that really lasts more in your hands than in your hair.  In addition, there isn't enough moisture in this product and the effect is twofold.  First, it doesn't spread well and you have to use a pretty sizable amount each application even with relatively short hair.  Second, it kind of dries my hair our over the course of the day.  I think I will use this for evenings out but not as part of a morning routine.	-1
Unfortunately, this wasn't a favorite for the following reasons:  - Compared to similar pastes/water based waxes, this paste did not give the flexible hold expected.  Hair remains flexible but the style didn't hold up for very long. - The scent is strong, so you really must enjoy it, and did doesn't fade away even hours later. - If you have dark hair, you need to blend it really really well or the white product shows up.  By the time it is rubbed and blended and rubbed and blended, the style is a mess and needs to be redone.  I would only recommend this for people with lighter hair who want minimal hold and love the scent.  It is low shine product which is a plus!	-1
I try to live a very healthy life.  I try to only put on my body what I'd also put in my mouth.  Meaning that I won't shower with or apply onto my body unsafe toxic ingredients.  This basically eliminates 99.9% sold in stores and online.  Finding hair styling products is tough.  I originally got this Man Made Paste because the Amazon description said "Contains: Macadamia Glycerides, Hydrolyzed Quinoa".  I searched the internet and no where could I find an actual ingredient list.  I took a chance and got it, going off of what I thought was the simple list of ingredients that Amazon posted.  When I got the actual Paste, I found the actual ingredients to be a long list of processed chemicals that I would never put on or in my body. I posted here a photo of the ingredients so that discriminating shoppers can see what is inside this hair Paste.	-1
I have worked with hair products on men for quite some time.  I have cut and styled hair and helped teach how to maintain styles for men.  Having products to recommend is always a plus, especially if it is effective and easy to use, which most men appreciate.  WHAT IS THIS LIKE? This paste is a rather odd product.  The jar has no instructions on it at all, so you are left to experiment on your own.  The appearance is simple and appealing for men.  The product inside is almost like rubbery.  It is not the kind of cream you can just run your finger over, you have to press your finger into it and hope you don't get too much on.  It is hard to gauge how much you will get on your finger, because it is so congealed.  The fragrance is going to be a deal breaker for some men, however. It is similar to Ojon but much more intense and not quite as natural smelling either.  HOW DOES THIS PERFORM? It depends on what type of hair you have as to how this will perform.  On short hair, it performs well, but you have to be careful not to use too much. On medium length hair, it gives that tousled look that is so popular among men.  It seems to last most of the day.  On long hair, not so much.  It seems a bit much for longer hair.  Another factor is hair coarseness and thickness.  This is not made for fine hair.  It is not made for very straight floppy hair either.  It is more for hair that has a wave to it, is medium to coarse, and already has some body.  That is, unless you are going for the pieced almost greasy look, then this will work on poker straight hair, especially with highlights.  It does have a satin finish, and does dry down to an almost dry feel, although too much will cross that line and weigh down certain hair.  THE FRAGRANCE At first I loved this fragrance in the jar.  It really is a nice smell.  When used on the hair, however, it is very overwhelming.  I found that although I liked it in the jar, it seemed to multiply in intensity on the hair, and it does not fade quickly either.  I found myself getting a headache after being around it on my hair, and my husband and son's hair.  I could not wait to get rid of it.  THE BOTTOM LINE This paste has potential to be good stuff.  It does a good job on certain hair types and styles, and holds them well.  The fragrance is too strong once it is applied to the hair.  It is like someone dumped a bottle of cheap cologne on the hair.  Although performance is good, the fragrance is just too high intensity.  If they toned it down some, it could actually be attractive.  As it is now, it is almost repulsive after wearing it a while.  Two stars from me just due to the overbearing smell.	-1
The smell. The smell pretty much overwhelmed everything. I could smell it all day at work, and even after during my workout. I couldn't wait to shower. When I put it on in the morning, it didn't really bother me and I thought it'd dissipate quickly. It stuck around. There are quite a few reviews on here that don't seem to mind it, so please do take my review with a grain of salt.  Outside of the smell, this product works really well. I need to find out if they make a scentless version of this, because I really did like the way it worked. It held my hair in place very well without needing too much of it.  Overall, if you like the smell, this is a great product. It made me nauseous so I can't really use it. I'd love it if it had no scent.	-1
This "18.21 Man Made" (?) hair styling paste is functional and pleasant as a pomade or hair product, but so intensely scented with a rather unpleasant patchouli-tobacco accord that I can't use it regularly. Texturally it's a thick, very dry-feeling lanolin and clay-based paste, with a lot of titanium white visible when you spread it into hands and hair -- in heavy application this might be a problem, visually, but it smells so strongly I couldn't tolerate  a heavy application anyhow. It applies nicely once softened -- needing significant body heat to do so -- and works okay, if not at all high-hold, as a hair styling addition. But the scent is like bathing your head in Kouros -- I felt I had a cloud of aggressive cheap cologne following me around for the whole day. Can't recommend it for anyone but the Axe-teenager crowd, due to the way-too-strong scent.	-1
Eeek. While the hold is great, the odor is overpowering. Given that it is a strong smokey/tobacco scent this will not be acceptable in a professional environment or even in an environment where one is working with the general population. I guess it smells like someone's elderly grandfather ... maybe something of faux wood paneled den with yellowing copies of This Old House/Popular Mechanics stacked in the corners. Nothing about this appealing so we tossed it after one trial run.  I guess if you work in career where tobacco scent is not a liability, and (for some reason) you find that scent appealing, this could be for you? Outside of trust-fund hipster babies, I cannot fathom for whom this is an appropriate, sexy option.	-1
This hair spray has a very strong smell. Even with two small sprays, the smell lasted for hours. It smells like a strong perfume a grandmother would wear that would overpower everyone. I really did not detect a tobacco smell. The hold is not as good as my wifes regular pump hairspray either.	-1
This hairspray reeks terribly of cheap cologne scent.  I don't think I'll be attracting any women with it either. It's terribly overpowering. So bad I had to actually jump back into the shower to wash it off. I only used two short sprays and it stunk up the entire bathroom.  I've had functionally bad hairspray but I would gladly use those over this one.  I would not use this hairspray under ANY condition given the unbearable scent. It would be such a huge turn off and I suspect it will most certainly irritate anyone within a whiff of.  I have never used a hairspray that smelled this strong, easily twice as strong as AXE body spray.	-1
I wish this product had worked out better.  I have very fine hair, so it can be challenging to find a product that doesn't weigh it down, but still adds hold and texture.  Even with my short, fine hair, Man Made Clay offered no hold and gave minimal, if any texture.  It is also hard to put on, prone to clumping unless you rub wet hands together once you get some product out.  I'm bummed, because it smells awesome, but it just doesn't do what it is supposed to do.	-1
For the price you receive a substantial amount of cologne and a nice looking bottle. This was not what I was expecting, of course I got this with my husband in mind but I first tried it out myself. My first opinion was that it was very strong and the smell did not dissipate, I was not impressed with the scent at all it reminded me of someone smoking cigars or a pipe.  I thought maybe I just don't have taste and that this stuff smells awesome but something was wrong with me.  Unfortunately my husband also did not like it, when he smelled it he got a little on his beard and it stayed on there for hours and he kept commenting throughout the day that he could still smell it. We let a couple of our friends smell it and they too did not like the scent.  I see most of the reviews saying how great this smells and I wish it smelled that good to us as well.	-1
I like the sound of a cologne that smelled like sweet tobacco and spirits, but my immediate impression was of strong musky vanilla smell.  Not terribly manly, TBH, and incredibly strong.  Also I'm not terribly impressed with the tacky sticker label, and cheap bottle.  The sprayer is not sealed, it was quite loose on the glass, so when the bottle arrived, part the box was soaked.  Looking at the sprayer, it was secured permanently and was tilted and slightly loose.  I was not able to get it off, but I could turn and wiggle it a bit.  Terribly cheap stuff, but on the other hand if you like it, it will go a long way.  This is a massive size for a man's perfume bottle, and it takes VERY little.  A single spray would be about 10x too much, IMO, so you might want to spray it onto a tissue, and then dab sparingly on your collar.  Do not put it on your skin, as the smell is impossible to wash off. It absorbs into your skin. It's been an entire day after I washed my hands a dozen times and I can still smell it.	-1
Genuis marketing and packaging, and you can easily transform poopy-pants into fancy-pants.  With that said, lets take a closer look at SKIN & CO Roma Truffle Therapy Cleansing Oil. Impressive company history. Impressive company logo. Impressive track record at Nordstrom. Impressive $30 price ticket. Sometimes we believe for a higher price, we get higher quality. Sometimes... and sometimes not!... Whether in English, Italian or any other language, it amounts to the universal language across the board: the brilliance of marketing and packaging a product.  Personally, I would never pay $30 for an oil that I use as a makeup remover. I typically buy $3.99 towelettes at Marshalls for that purpose. However, as a Vine member, I thought I would give it a go and put the oil to the test.  Though I use oil sparingly on my face, I tried using SKIN & CO Roma Truffle Therapy Cleansing Oil on a cotton ball to strip the pore-cleaning mask off my face. The oil is scentless, which is fine, did an okay job stripping my mask, but feels very much like ahhh, duh, greasy oil!  The oil in the bottle does separate, but a few good shakes and no problem. The next day, my face felt oilier than usual and my forehead broke out. That skin aftereffect, however, is NOT the reason I gave this product a negative review.  Nope, not at all. I took it a step further and decided to investigate some of the ingredients that formulate SKIN & CO Roma Truffle Therapy Cleansing Oil..  Here is a quick rundown.  1. Aqua. Ummm, okay so it consists mostly of water. Not too impressive.  2. Sweet Almond Oil. Overall, good moisturizing nutrient that helps to reduce inflammation and irritation of the skin.  3. Isononyl isononanoate. This is the third ingredient, which means it is the third prominent ingredient in the oil after the sweet almond oil ingredient. I found that this chemical is a potentially pore-clogging/irritating ingredient.  4. Ethylhexylglycerin. Okay, theres just a dab of this ingredient in the product because it falls on the bottom of the ingredient list. However, it is on the Bubble and Bee list of Chemicals to avoid list.  And I quote:  "What its used for: Deodorant agent, skin conditioning agent, preservative booster Avoid it because:  It is a known skin irritant, can possibly damage and irritate eyes, and is known to cause dermatitis. What its made from: Derived from vegetable glycerin."  "Dont let the fact that its derived from vegetable glycerin fool you.  So is propelyne glycol! Many of the "natural" and "organic" companies use this as an alternative to parabens as a preservative. No matter what their label claims, it is not a natural preservative."  And I repeat: No matter what their label claims, it is not a natural preservative.  So, I ask you: SKIN & CO Roma Truffle Therapy Cleansing Oil poopy-pants or fancy-pants?  To be fair, I investigated the other ingredients in the bottle and found the MAJORITY of ingredients to pass with flying colors. Just be aware, that if you want to put your best face forward, be fully aware of what you put on it!  I, personally, prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Viva-Naturals-Organic-Argan-Oil-4-oz-Moroccan-Luxury-Oil-for-Silky-Smooth-Hair-Softer-Skin/dp/B01BZ1OP9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Viva Naturals Organic Argan Oil 4 oz, Moroccan Luxury Oil for Silky, Smooth Hair & Softer Skin</a>, another oil I was reviewing along with Skin & COs brand. It is a pure oil, not one that is chemical-based and certainly cheaper to use in the long run.	-1
I'm not sure if I received a different product than others did, since one reviewer mentioned the product says to use "three or four pumps." My product doesn't have a pump, just a cap, and the instructions just say to apply "the right amount of product," whatever that means.  Unlike other reviewers, I really don't care for this cleanser. I found it does a lousy job of removing eye makeup (even though I only wearing non-waterproof mascara) and required a LOT of rubbing of the eye area to remove even that much. I tried both putting this on a cotton pad as instructed, and applying it directly to my skin, in case that helped. In both cases, I saw plenty of makeup residue when I applied toner with a cotton pad afterwards. Given how much makeup was on the toner pad, I ended up washing my face with my regular (Algenist) cleanser rather than risk a breakout from clogged pores.  On the plus side, it doesn't have fragrance and comes well-packaged. Considering how much of this you have to use, and how poorly it actually cleans, it's way overpriced. I'll stick with Algenist, which cleans beautifully without stripping my skin and costs less (and I use a lot less of it).	-1
I was having a hard time deciding if this should give a two or three star review so I settled on a 2.5+.  It is called a glaze for beautiful color but I am not sure it's also supposed to also be a conditioner.  When reading the instructions, it reads as both.  I certainly noticed my hair shinier after applying the glaze (I have used it 3 times) but the conditioning was just not there.  The last time I used it I added my normal conditioner and it looked much better.  When I get my hair colored and cut I also get a 'glaze' at the salon for 20.00.  It immediately super shines my hair and super conditions it.  If this glaze did both it would be completely worth the price, but it doesn't.  The 2.5 stars is because it does make your hair shinier but you can buy shine sprays for 1/3 of the price which will do the same.  This is not a product I would recommend to anyone because of the price and the lack of a softening conditioner.	-1
I had high hopes for this product, because I was looking for something to give my highlights a little extra shine without having to make a trip to my stylist. Unfortunately, this glaze did fall short of what I was looking for. While it did give my hair a little bit of extra shine, I wouldn't dare say it was "intense shine." I have used regular conditioning products that have provided more sheen and shine without the hefty almost $60 price tag.  The most disappointing aspect was that this weighed my hair down significantly, almost to the point that it looked as if I had not even washed it in days. I have an oily scalp, so I even gave it another try, making sure to not only use less, but completely avoid the top portion of my hair, with the hopes that the results would be better. This wasn't the case. My hair still looked greasy and just absolutely awful, luckily it was nothing that a good shampoo and treatment with my regular conditioner couldn't fix. This was my first time trying an ORIBE, so I can't compare it with others, but I can say that I wasn't impressed with the results I had using this Glaze.	-1
I have used ORIBE products before and have always liked them but the steep price would ultimately lead me to choose other brands.  This glaze did not work for me at all.  Although I did notice a bit of added shine it was certainly not worth the terrible, greasy/dirty feeling that came along with it.  My hair felt disgusting-almost like I had been swimming in chlorine & air dried my hair without washing first.  Not only did my hair feel awful, I thought this glaze smelled like dog shampoo.  Anyone with a dog knows that dog shampoo has a very distinct scent and this glaze smelled just like that scent to me.  It even made my pillow smell so badly that I had to wash not just the case but the pillow itself to remove the scent.  Given my prior experience with this brand I cannot help but question the authenticity of this product.  Giving two stars because if did make hair shiny as promised but all other side effects were so negative that I would never use this product again. Definitely not worth the price.	-1
Some background: I have been doing a Korean 10 step beauty routine, or some iteration of it, for the last six months or so, and prior to that I was using facial cleanser, serum, and either a moisturizer or a moisturizing facial oil for some time, so I'm familiar with using oils and some of the strategies for making them work. For example, if I'm having a hormonal day where I feel like I might break out, I apply the oil onto my wet hands and rub it around first before applying to my face to kind of dilute the oil and keep me from breaking out. Other times when I need more moisture, I rubbed the oil onto my dry hands and apply directly.  I have tried a variety of beauty oils for the face, and I usually like ones with the most natural ingredients, though I do intersperse them with using a regular moisturizer just because I find a lot of the oils sit on my face and don't sink in quite as effectively as I might hope. That said, they provide a great barrier of protection for those days when I have to be outside more, because I work as a landscaper there are a lot of days when I am in the elements.  This oil falls short in the ingredients department into really notable ways: first, the artificial fragrance is absolutely awful. On first sniff, it's not too bad, however I'm not used to having a facial oil be fragranced. Given that fragrance is one of the primary skin irritants, and given the fact that people usually use facial oils when they have delicate, sensitive, or aging skin, why in the world would they muck up a premium product by adding such a common irritant that many people don't like? I can tell you that if I want to smell the fragrance on my skin all day, it won't be something like this  I would instead carefully select a fragranced lotion or perfume. I don't look to my facial oil to provide a fragrant ambience to my day.  Then, later in the ingredients it contains hydrogenated vegetable oil. I don't know about you, but when I cook with vegetable oil, it tends to break me out. I don't see any justification at all for putting hydrogenated vegetable oil in such an expensive facial oil product. There are wonderful facial oils on the market that are fairly inexpensive in comparison to this  definitely less than half of the retail price, that do not contain any of this junk. In addition, you can find ones for cheaper that have coldpressed or organic ingredients. Just here locally, I have a number of vendors blending up beautiful, simple facial oil blends with truly high-end ingredients and they do not charge so much money for them.  I can't speak to the long-term effects of using this oil because I couldn't tolerate it. In fact, on the first day of using, I had to wash my face multiple times to try to get the fragrance off, because it was making my face well and making me need to sneeze. The fragrance is not that bad, I am just extremely sensitive to fragrance on my skin care products. However, I use a number of Korean beauty products and even though a few of them do have fragrance, the vast majority don't have anything like this. I've also used a lot of lush facial products, all of which do have some natural essential oil fragrance, and those don't bother me either. This really smells like a drugstore shampoo, and why in the world they would put it on a facial oil, I really can't tell you.  There is some good stuff in here, but the fact that it's overshadowed by an overbearing fragrance and a few questionable ingredients, plus a lack of organic or coldpressed oils, makes me think that the price tag is just due to Cindy Crawford's name and not due to the ingredients. It's a shame. From reading the ingredients I had higher hopes.	-1
Foremost, those with sensitivities and allergies to fragrance may want to try this in-person (perhaps at your dermatologist's office) before buying it. This cleanser has a strong citrus fragrance that I enjoyed, but others may find problematic.  Secondly, I began by washing with just my hands, but the "plastic-y" beads are so large and sparse, that I didn't feel it was having any genuine impact. So, I grabbed my Clarisonic. That was a huge error ... the "plastic-like" beads brought my Clarisonic to a grinding stop. I had to quickly turn it off, disassemble the Clarisonic, and rinse the "plastic-like" pieces from all areas.  And, yes, do know that the "beads" are a "plastic-like material" made from polylactic acid.  (They recently switched from actual plastic beads to these polylactic acid beads as a result of national legislation that required them to do so). They are very large (comparatively speaking) ... and, unless there was a manufacturing issue with this lot, there were (relatively speaking) very few per application.  Overall, this didn't do much for my skin (I have used Ole Henriksen products for years so maybe I'm not the ideal candidate ... maybe someone who never exfoliates would notice a more substantial difference), but the scent was pretty yummy.  If you are seeking a truly great exfoliating product, try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ole-Henriksen-Walnut-Complexion-Scrub-3-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B01FJBBIVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ole Henriksen Walnut Complexion Scrub, 3 Fluid Ounce</a>. It is natural, luxurious, and works like a dream. Likewise, add a Clarisonic into your daily regimen for gentle but effective exfoliation. Both are a great, effective ways to exfoliate your skin.	-1
As you age, cell turnover in the skin slows down, so regular facial exfoliation becomes paramount to maintain youthful radiance.  I perform a two-step cleanse every single night - removing my make-up with a light cleansing oil followed by an exfoliating scrub.  I prefer mechanical exfoliants (scrubs) to chemical ones (acids) because the results are immediate.  I had high hopes for this product because it combines the best of both worlds - cleansing beads to scrub dead skin with polylactic acid, for slower-acting but more long term benefits.  On the upside, a little goes a long way.  Honestly, a dime size amount makes plenty of foam  that handily cleanses your entire face.  So the 5.1 ounce tube should last a good long time.  Plus the fragrance (kind of a candy sweet citrus - like lemon Skittles) is rather appealing.  Unfortunately those are about the only two things to recommend this cleanser.  First off, the cleansing beads are very sparse and don't really give the impression they're doing much of anything in terms of sloughing off dead skin.  And I get the feeling they're not natural or water soluble, but instead are the plastic beads that are so bad for the environment.  And the acid itself must be extremely mild because I haven't experienced the tingling sensation associated with even the mildest acid products I've used in the past.  After two weeks of using this nearly every night, I feel as if my skin is not quite as fresh and glow-y as it is when I use my normal exfoliators (St. Ives Apricot Scrub and Lush Dark Angels).  Not a bad product, if you're just looking for a basic foaming cleanser but not particularly effective in the exfoliation department.	-1
I thought this cologne was terrible smelling as did my wife.  I would not wear for every day use nor on a date.  It has an overwhelming citrus smell that I did not think was subtle at all.  Can't recommend this when there are so many other good colognes on the market.	-1
I'm a long time fan of Amazing Grace scent by Philosophy. I thought the men's Amen fragrance sounded promising. The scent starts off with a pleasant citrus scent. Unfortunately, the scent than takes a bad turn. It's hard to explain, but the citrus fades to a cleaning fluid smell. Yuk. Three of us all came to the same conclusion.	-1
I love bulgari. It is a wonderful clean scent with just the right hint of manly spicy end notes. This starts off with the same citrus notes with a little heavier lime but as it transitions to the floral bouquets and spicy undertones it loses some of the depth and staying power. It quickly devolves into just hints of sweet citrus. 4 outa 4 people could not tell difference between it and Bv for first few minutes. After an hour 4 out of 4 could and preferred bulgari.  As a scent alone I'd give it  3.5 stars. For this price and this staying power and for being a total bulgari knock off id give it 0 if I could.	-1
Just a typical concealer. Nothing special.	-1
I have straight fine hair and was excited to try this product. The product is a lotion and the bottle top has a long straw attached to it. You unscrew the top and pull it off and there is product on the straw. I found this way of dispensing the product to be odd. The product itself smells nice, and a little goes a long way. Unfortunately, it did not give my hair beach waves. When I tried air drying my hair was frizzy and when I used the product with a hair dryer it dried out my ends. I also didn't like the residue it left on my hair after drying. Perhaps this product would work better for someone with thicker hair. I used the produce on several occasions and I cannot recommend it for those who have fine hair.	-1
This is a sweet smelling pomade the consistency of cold cream. The fragrance is fine but the product makes my hair dirty looking, even when applying a little bit. It tames down the frizz but with a hair gelled wet and stiff look.  I recently tried their&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ORIBE-Body-Wash/dp/B01KPUWJDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ORIBE Body Wash</a>&nbsp;which is absolutely amazing and expected the same of this product but am disappointed. I have short, fine wavy hair that frizzes terribly in the rain. Unfortunately, this is not the product for me.	-1
This product sucks! I'm not sure if I'm not using it right, but it did nothing for my hair! I followed the same technique as in oribe's video, but it left my hair feeling waxy, sticky, and did nothing to tame the frizz/puffiness as it claims it should. For reference, I have long fine wavy dry hair, that tends to frizz up in the bang area after I wash it. Also my bottle came with a giant indentation in the center of it, which means a lot of the product is missing. I'm returning, this was really bad, not worth the money, and I can't even say who it would work for. Maybe short hairstyles only.	-1
This is a nice set, although the masks included are very tiny jars and are probably only good for a few uses. The cleanser works fine, but didn't really leave my skin feeling refreshed or any softer or tighter. The masks themselves, well, seemed made mainly of snake oil. I noticed no difference in the product, unlike the Agora stuff I normally use. You'd probably have the same effects with drugstore stuff, like Oil of Olay.	-1
not at all effective for me	-1
For some reason this product burned my face when I applied it, could be because my skin is sensitive but im sure it will work for others :)	-1
This may be a great product by I couldn't get past the perfume. It is very strongly scented. I'm a little sensitive to fragrance and I knew it would bother me if i used it. Sorry, but I couldn't even try it.	-1
Unlike all the other reviewers so far, I did not like this clay mask at all.  First, the box seal was broken.  Not a good thing for a cosmetic product, especially a facial one.  Second, the "woodsy" scent is pretty intolerable to me and it lingers.  It did not cause a sinus headache, but I simply can't stand it.  Third, even though I have combination skin, the mask left my skin feeling tight and dry.  I might have expected that in the winter, when electric heat dries out my skin, but not in the summer.  (The product is recommended for combination to oily skin.)  On a positive note, however, it is a good clarifying mask; it does leave your skin bright and clean.  I like using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Noxzema-Classic-Clean-Moisturizing-Cream-12oz/dp/B003LA90RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Noxzema Classic Clean Moisturizing Cream 12oz</a>, especially in the summer since it lowers skin temperature, but it leaves a film, and I use a clarifying soap so often due to that.  This clay mask would work well as a clarifier, but I dislike too much about it to use it again.	-1
When I opened the jar, there was a light refreshing scent that was quite pleasant.  When I applied it, there was a nice cool sensation that felt refreshing compared to the 90-degree weather.  After 5 minutes, I messaged it gently with my fingertips and could feel the grit of the volcanic rock, then I rinsed it off with water.  Or I tried to rinse it off.  It took quite a bit of scrubbing.  As soon as it was off, tiny white bumps immediately started appearing on my face.  Then my skin started itching and turning red.  For something that felt so good going on, this sure left my face in worse condition than before I used it.	-1
This is a cooling gel moisturizer. It is not greasy. The description says it lasts for 48 hours, but I do not find that it compares in keeping my skin moisturized with other creamy moisturizers that I have used, that are at a much lower price.  I am becoming increasingly concerned at cosmetics that are not sealed. The top of the box has a clear plastic seal, however the bottom can be opened and shut and it has no seal. All of this could have been solved with a seal in the container but there is none. So for those of you that are careful about non sealed items, you might want to look elsewhere, as well as knowing that this does not hydrate  at least for me for the promised 48 hours.	-1
I prefer an aftershave that does not linger. You'll be smelling this all day.	-1
The masque itself is fine and left my skin feeling good, reduced blotchiness, pores a little tighter. For me it is no better in terms of efficacy than many other masques I have tried. It works well enough and the residue rinsed off fairly easily.  I am going 2 stars for this product as the application instructions just did not work for me. The masque itself was very large for my face, landing a fair amount in my hair. The white section peeled off easily for both halves of the masque. Unfortunately the clear section would not come off without removing the masque ingredients. I work with bandages, dressings and peelables all day long as a nurse so I saw it as a professional challenge. I could not get this layer off, leaving the masque behind. I ended up leaving the chest plastic on. I looked like a hockey goalie but it was the only way to test it.  This felt good on and came off easily. However it is my opinion that this method of application just didn't work. I'd rather have a jar of product and apply it myself.	-1
I love BB creams so I was really excited to try this. When I first got it, I was thinking, wow that's really dark. Then I noticed on the back the color says Latte. Does that mean they make more than one color? Did I get a dark color without thinking? I was hesitant to try this because it was so dark but I figured, hey, I want to see if it will help my legs with some color and to hide any imperfections I have. Applying it with a makeup sponge was fairly easy. It blended out really well but the color was just not me.  Not to mention the makeup was rubbing off on my clothing. The top of my white socks were covered. I actually felt more self-conscious going out with my legs covered in make-up than I did with them just super white. I have 3 BB creams at home so I didn't bother using this on my face because of the color.	-1
While it went on easily and blended well and it made my legs look good, I wouldn't recommend this product inasmuch as it came off all over my clothes even though I did allow it to dry.	-1
I tried this on my face using my Cailyn O! Wow Brush - the brush does a very good job of blending this product out.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CAILYN-O-Wow-Make-Up-Brush/dp/B00MAE1O0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CAILYN O Wow Make Up Brush</a>. You need to use very little, dotting it lightly and then blending it in with the brush (or your fingers).  Why I don't like it: A. I have some hyper-pigmentation from using tanning beds years ago. This product makes these areas appear even darker. It doesn't cover them or even them out, unfortunately. B. It gives me a glow, but in the sunlight, it's tiny specks of glitter.	-1
After trying and recommending another Vita Liberata product --&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vita-Liberata-Phenomenal-2-3-Week-Tinted-Tan-Mousse-Medium-4-22-fl-oz/dp/B00865610O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vita Liberata Phenomenal 2-3 Week Tinted Tan Mousse, Medium, 4.22 fl. oz.</a>-- I was fully prepared to become a Body Blur fan. Who wouldn't want a product designed to "minimize blemishes, cover imperfections, and smooth skin appearance while reflecting light for a photo-ready skin finish?" And it lasts a full day, meaning that theoretically you will apply in the morning and it will look great when midnight rolls around.  Before ordering this item, I watched the Vita Liberata video that shows a bikini-clad model whose skin looks about a million times more perfect than mine ever has, even without additional product. So if that is the target for Body Blur, I'm not it, but thought I'd check it out anyway because you never know.  I have tried it a few times, both on my arms and (bravely) on my face. My skin color is naturally dark, and on my arms, the Body Blur sort of but not completely masked my freckles, mostly by darkening the surrounding skin to freckle color and adding a light shimmer, which I could have done without as it tended to highlight my other various skin imperfections.  Applying it to my face was a mistake. Despite following directions, I ended up with splotchy colors. There are lots of bronzing and HD products that are designed for the face and do a better job. BB is not a good look unless you are trolling for sympathy or questions about what you've got on your face. Mixing it with sunscreen produces better results, but no better than tinted sunscreen which is less work (and offers many less expensive options).  Advantages: very little fragrance, non-toxic ingredients.  Someday, in my next career as a bikini model who never plans ahead, this may be my go-to product, but since I'm happy with the self-tanner, I will continue to use that on my arms and legs. It lasts longer and has no sheen, so even though it's not instant, I prefer it.	-1
This is definitely more of a brown color not a true nude.	-1
Meh- nothing special. My maybeliine lip pencil performs better and it is a lot less money.	-1
Expected longer lashes with this product	-1
This polish is either old, defective or ZOYA hasn't figured out how to combine performance with less toxic ingredients. As soon as it dried on my nails, many tiny lines formed across the surface of my nails. It was the strangest thing, almost like the polish was cracking. I hadn't even moved my hands! I removed the polish, shook the bottle well and tried again but the same thing happened! I then took it with me to a professional salon for a manicure and ended up with the same results so it definitely doesn't have to do with my application. Unfortunately, I can't return it because I threw the box away (because who expects to have to return a bottle of nail polish?) so I guess I am out the $10. :-( This was also my first experience with this brand (ZOYA). I wanted a less toxic product but it still has to perform to basic minimum quality nail polish standards. I won't be purchasing ZOYA again.	-1

Quality of the polish is fine however the color is much darker than the image suggest and does not really look green at all.	-1
For this price this definitely disappointed. For me and my partner we saw no difference. To be fair I received just the tube without any instructions and we sort of had to guess how to use it. It dries fast, so that the big clue its a mask, but it definitely comes out more like a heavy cream. We tried leaving it on for 2 minutes and 5 minutes and 10 minutes and used it probably 5 times a piece over a two week period. I have drier skin, my partner has more oily/acne prone skin and neither of saw any difference, and certainly not any difference that would warrant the price and waiting 2-10 minutes for it to kick in.	-1
Cant get past the bug-spray smell!  Ive smelled this before on someone in the office a few times and I thought she had on bug spray.  When I received this and sprayed it the first time I instantly realized its the exact same smell!  How are people getting past this horrible smell!?!?  I mean, really!??  It doesnt fade away either.	-1
Not very good.  Especially at this price.  My wife was expecting a lot more. To be fair, she uses a competitive product, offered at a lower cost that she really enjoys.  Compared against her favorite, Natura Bisse nothing special.  It also has a strong, chemical oder masked with lavender. Smells like cheap hotel soap.	-1
First, Amazon sent me the wrong size - I ordered the 1.7 and received the .5 oz, 15ml version instead.  Having used the small version, I can't tell if the larger one would provide better results over time. The price of the 1.7 oz version, however, is very high and for that same price you could get a Botox treatment, quite frankly.  It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel nice and smooth, but I honestly can't say it shaved twenty years off my skin. It feels very concentrated so you don't need a lot, which is a relief given how pricey it is. I think La Mer has a better scent and makes my skin feel (and look) just as good, and looks like a bargain compared to this.  Take away the price point, and it's a decent but not extraordinary anti-aging moisturizer.	-1
iS CLINICAL Hydra-Cool Serum, 1 fl. oz. is supposed to rejuvenate, hydrate and soothe skin. It supposedly contains super antioxidants, botanicals and bio-nutrients. To give a fair review, I've been using this trial sample size for a few weeks. I can honestly say, I don't see any difference in my skin at all.  After shaving, it does cool irritated skin a little, but not enough to warrant the cost. As for feeding my skin with antioxidants and nutrients, if there are any- it's not enough to make a noticeable difference in my skin. Fine wrinkles are still here. My skin is not any more soft or supple from any moisturizing effect. I just don't see any difference in my skin with this product, other than it cools shaved skin a bit, but I can always use an inexpensive aloe product for that.	-1
It wasn't too oily and my skin did not break out. So that's good. However, I saw no noticeable change in my skin. Whatsoever	-1
The main selling point of this shampoo was that it was "volumizing" shampoo. For myself I found this shampoo had no noticeable effect on volumizing. On that alone I think it's a fail. But the other problem is the packaging. The bottle is made out of metal. This is a problem if it happens to fall on a surface that might chip or your toes. You also can't squeeze the bottle so the shampoo has to be a somewhat runny consistency. The smell is very neutral, a minor hint of generic soap scent. I can't recommend this based on the volumizing claim. Maybe others will have better luck with it.	-1
My wife does not like this shampoo. she said it makes her hair feel dirty.	-1
I've tried much out of the Ahava product line, including their body lotion and hand creams, and this foot cream has failed to impress me. I was satisfied with the results of Ahava's body lotion, but this foot cream is too lightweight and unaffective to make a lasting impact on my dry feet. I notice no results the following day. I have given this product enough of a try - I'm halfway through the tube. But I've moved on to something more nourishing.	-1
This deodorant does not smell good!  There are some universally pleasing scents, and this is not one of them. My girlfriend absolutely hates the smell, and made me wash it off immediately.	-1
This product dispenses with a narrow cone of strong mist, rather than a light, drifting, wide-angle spray. That makes it hard to control and get the desired amount in the right places without overdoing it where you already have enough. Apart from that, I did not find that I got the results I want, and FOR SURE didn't think it merited $7.50/ounce in value. I far prefer a different product, which I used to finish my styling yesterday when the Phyto one failed to perform:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Aussie-Sprunch-Hair-Spray-Fixatif-Flexible-Hold-8-5-oz-Pack-of-2/dp/B00B7AUKCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Aussie Sprunch Hair Spray, Fixatif Flexible Hold 8.5 oz (Pack of 2)</a>	-1

I am not terribly impressed with this cleanser. I have been using Effaclar but have found it hard to find. So when I was offered the opportunity to try this, I was willing. Sadly, in my opinion, it is not anywhere near as effective as Effaclar. Within about a week of using this cleanser, my pores began to enlarge and I developed blackheads; something I haven't dealt with in fifteen years or so. Additionally, it doesn't remove makeup from my skin very well at all. With my previous cleanser, two pumps onto a washcloth provided excellent lather and my skin was clean and soft afterwards. To get the same amount of lather from this cleanser it takes about four pumps - instead of two - and it still doesn't remove all traces of my foundation. I always use toner after cleansing, and after using this product, the cotton ball with the toner applied comes away with makeup on it. After cleansing with Effaclar, no traces of my foundation remain. So, I guess I will be going back to my Effaclar.	-1
I was so excited about this product - I'd been using it for about a week (on my face and body) and my super-sensitive skin actually hadn't broken out at all. And then . . . it all changed. First, my face began breaking out worse than it had in quite a long time, so I stopped using this on my face. A few days after that, I started getting really bad breakouts on my chest, back, and shoulders. I stopped using the cleansing gel entirely at that point. I waited for things to clear up (which began to happen almost immediately), and then I decided to give it another try just to make sure that something else wasn't the culprit because I really wanted this to work. Unfortunately, the same thing happened with the breakouts, only this time, they showed up within a day or two.  I don't know which ingredient(s) is to blame, but this cleansing gel just doesn't work for me. On the plus side, I seem to be a rarity in that regard, so the odds seem to be pretty good that this will work just fine for most prospective buyers.	-1
I love a good self-tanner as much as the next pale girl does, but I just cannot commit to 8 hours with this product. We all know that the smell of self-tanner is a special kind of smell you just have to deal with for a bit to get the results you want. However, this was still above and beyond that for me. I'm really sensitive to smells to begin with, but I've tried several products from Vichy and have always been happy with the scent situation. Not this time. I rinsed off with cool/warm water after about 2.5 hours and it just gave the slightest hint of a tan. I did not use this on my face, so I can't say how the absorption is on that skin, but everywhere else was even with no streaks or dark blotches. The cream rubbed in easily and evenly, but I did feel tacky for about an hour afterward. I did not have any transfer onto material, but I was careful to wear baggy clothing and not lay or sit directly on many surfaces.	-1
Reviewed by my wife: This didn't effectively remove my makeup - which isn't even waterproof. I was left with greasy dark shadows on my eyes that I had to rub off with a towel, because the product is apparently not water soluble. Left my skin feeling slick and oily, and after a few minutes, it started feeling irritated. I threw the tube in the trash.	-1
Ive always wanted to try an Anthony product, and decided to purchase this algae face cleanser. After about a year of using it, these are my thoughts:  Pros: - applies easily and washes off easily. - bottle lasts a long time, so not as expensive as it may seem. - cool-looking aqua blue color.  Cons: - The cleanser itself was nothing special. In terms of performance, it did as well as any cheap Neutrogena cleaner. - The product gets stuck in the small dispenser hole and makes a blue mess on the top of the bottle. Youll have to wipe it down to keep it clean. - Despite the blue marine color, it has an orange scent. Huh? Make it orange if you want to give it an orange scent. I expected a marine-like aquatic scent.  Ill finish out the existing bottle but won't buy it again.	-1
Expensive.	-1
Just ok.	-1
Didn't really get much conditioning out of it, my hair felt very coarse.	-1
I was excited to try this water canvas base because I love trying new products. I like the Vincent Longo brand and know that it is a quality brand. My traditional face makeup routine just involves BB Cream and HD Finishing Powder. I have found that this combination works much better for me than using foundation, powder, etc. So, I do not use primer on a daily bases. I have however used a few different primers and really liked them. This Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base is much different from anything else I have tried in the past.  The Base is very silky feeling. It absorbs very quickly into my skin when I put it on. Unfortunately, this makes it a little hard to tell where you left off on your application. The base also doesn't seem to really spread, it just absorbs where you put it on. As a result, it seems like I use a lot of the product every time I apply it.  I have used this water canvas base several times now with my traditional makeup and I have used it a few times with regular foundation. I honestly don't notice a difference with it. I don't have wrinkles or fine lines at this point in my life (I'm 30), so I don't know if that is why I don't notice a difference. Either way, this product did nothing for me. While it didn't make my skin feel gross or give me any issues, it didn't give me any improvements either.  This product just did not work for me. I can not recommend it.	-1
I tried this on half my face and used my favorite primer on the other. I didn't notice any difference with the Vincent base, it was like I didn't have anything on under my foundation. My pores were still completely visible. This will come in handy during the drier months as it does provide moisture, but not too much. However, it's just another step so I don't foresee me using all of it for quite some time.	-1
The first thing I noticed is the scent or lack of it.  Which to me, is a good thing.  Too many products have scents that can compete with my perfume.  The product goes on easily and smoothly.  I use it in the morning before applying my foundation.  After using the base for 2 weeks, I don't notice any significant difference.  My foundation may glide on a little easier but as for the overall look, no real improvement. For the cost (currently at $44.00 USD) I would pass.  Too expensive.	-1
I received this free through the Amazon Vine program. I wouldn't have purchased it at this price (especially for such a small quantity). The product goes on smoothly and feels nice -- not greasy or heavy. However, I noticed no difference in my look after I put on makeup. Not worth the price if it doesn't make me look better.	-1
I tried this On my hands and they immediately started to burn and turned red. I don't know what component caused this reaction but it was pretty intense. I scrubbed it off but it stayed red and itchy for half an hour. I don't know if it would do this to everyone but for me the reaction was enough for me to not risk using it again.	-1
I did not like the fragrance or consistency of this product. i discontinued use after a few days.	-1

Extremely disappointed to have received this product and found that the ingredient list on the bottle is radically different than what is listed on this product page. I love MB products but have decided to start phasing propylene glycol, parabens, artificial coloring, artificial fragrance (parfum), and other harsh chemicals out of my skincare routine. I was so excited to have found an MB product with more natural ingredients, and am so sad to have been so mislead. The product I received has 21 ingredients listed on the bottle, vs. 5 listed here on the product page. If you are looking for a more natural option, this is not it.	-1
Going on 3 weeks and this hasn't done a thing. It actually seems to have made my acne worse. I kept using this, as directed in hopes that it was just because it was a new product. I'd definitely consider something else. I have combo skin, 33 years old.... Buy some Stridex red box and save the money	-1
So I feel like this does absolutely NOTHING for my skin. I might as well be applying water...	-1
meh....... Sorry for my bad reviews on any other Mario Badescu line of products....After using this as well as other products from this brand for a month, I saw ZERO effects from using this cream. I rather slather NIVEA (from Germany) under my eye and see much much better result next morning.	-1
sorry to report this is already at the bottom of my drawer.	-1
Hmm, I like other Mario Badescu products but found this Glycolic Gel to be too harsh for my skin.  I will say that a little bit of this stuff goes a long way, so while I can't use it on my face, I've been using it on rough patches like my heels and knees and it works well there and lasts forever!  I've since switched to a lactic acid serum with better results.	-1
This serum aka moisturizer has a strange consistency to it. It's somewhat greasy and a little gooey. After using it a few times, I found little results, and it made my skin feel oily. I wasn't impressed with this product at all. It's something I wouldn't recommend or use again. I would stick to more traditional types of skin care products.  Katiebabs	-1
It is really sticky texture. It did not work for me.	-1
The texture of this stuff is like honey. If I put it on before bedtime, I wake up with my hands covered in lint. And it's too sticky to use any other time of day. I couldn't use it enough to really tell you if it works.	-1
Okay this iron has a problem. I don't know why the reviews didn't mention how the barrel clip is short. If you have a long hair, more than half of your hair won't curl. Clip needs to be longer in order for it to curl well.	-1
Unfortunately it didn't work well for me. I had a few times to last a few days and a few times to last one day only.	-1
I was excited to get this because I am always trying to find new personal grooming products that do not contain animal products and do not test on animals. Surely, I thought, a brand named Laura Biagiotti Roma Uomo would not test on animals. But when I got the bottle and started trying to find out, I discovered that this is a Proctor and Gamble product, a company that is among the worst offenders in the world when it comes to unnecessary testing on animals. So, I will not be buying this after I am finished with this bottle.  Enough people these days would prefer to use cruelty free products that you would think that more manufacturers would end testing on animals. Luckily many manufacturers  do not use animal products in their shampoos and soaps to the degree that they used to, but the testing continues nonetheless. Most testing is done on rabbits, both because they do not have tear ducts and therefore are not able to remove the chemicals placed on their eyes by blinking as effectively as animals with tear ducts, and because they have large eyes, making it easy to have shampoos and soaps applied directly on their eyes.  It is a real shame that they test this brand on animals because it is otherwise a very interesting bath gel. It has a number of subtle and  interesting scents. As a product I like it very much. If it were not tested on animals I would probably consider using this on a regular basis. Unfortunately they do, which means that I cannot in good conscience use what would otherwise be a fine product.	-1
This product is not great. It has a very watery consistency, it doesn't absorb, it's sticky.  It tastes good, but you'll find yourself quickly removing it by doing daily life tasks. That said, it makes an okay cheek tint. I had a terrible time blending it, and it was tacky in texture all day, but the color is nice...?	-1
I was confused by this candles packaging.  Its marketed as flammable.  If a candle doesnt burn, whats the point?  Im assuming they add that to the tagline to be funny, but it misses the mark.  The jar is covered in writing, describing the candle in great detail.  I don't think this is attractive at all  I think it looks rather silly, especially given that the text is black on black and difficult to make out.  The candle is made from soy wax, which means you shouldnt use it on a candle warmer.  It also means that the wax is very soft; the heat from my fingertip left marks.  In fact, it melted sitting in the sunlight in my living room.  I expected it to have a much stronger fragrance than it does.  You have to practically stick your nose in it to tell its scented.  For some people thats a plus, though.  I enjoyed the actual smell, but I had to light it to get the full effect.  Of course, for most people, thats the point.  Myself, I like to enjoy the smell even when the candle isn't burning.  And given that I have a ten month old kitten in my household, burning candles are few and far between!  I liked the candle, ugly jar aside.  I don't think its worth paying the $45.00 Amazon price, however.  There are much prettier candles on the market for much less, that smell just as nice (and which can be safely used on candle warmers, or not lit at all and still enjoyed).	-1
I have deep purple shadows under my eyes, and the skin there tends to look and feel like crepe.  I also tend to wake up with a lot of puffiness.  Ive tried a lot of different eye creams and serums (both luxury brands and products from the drug store) that claim to brighten, soften, de-puff, and de-wrinkle. Not one of them has made a difference. Im not sure what made me think this cream would be any better.  Maybe its the fact that there are a couple of actual patents on the formula, held by university researchers.  Maybe it was the unique combination of ingredients (like Niacin and licorice). The Nia cream did a pretty good job as a moisturizer.  It didn't cause any irritation, didn't have a funky smell, and a little bit goes a very long way.  But its been a few weeks now and Ive noticed no difference between what this cream does and what my plain old inexpensive Olay eye cream does  which is moisturize and little else.  It claims to The current Amazon price for this product is $71.00 for half an ounce.  I honestly cant recommend it.  For no more than it did for me, Ill stick to my Olay for a third of the price.	-1
Sorry to say that this heavy-silicone "serum" (which feels like Frizz-Ease) sits on top of my skin and does not soak in, leaving it looking and feeling greasy on the outside but tight on the inside.  I will keep it to use as a leave-in hair conditioner, but will no longer be putting this on my face.	-1
Quality of the polish is fine however the color is much darker than the image suggest and does not really look green at all.	-1
This is gray, not gray green, just gray. Not as described or pictured. Not eligible for return. Buyer beware.	-1
This product did not work for me. Felt like moisturizer when applying, and took quite a long time to dry before it ended up just getting smeared in my shirt. The whole time using this product, my arm pit felt sticky, and after a couple of hours I had the regular arm pit odors. So I doubt the claims of the product lasting 24 hours when it couldn't even last a couple. I would  not recommend this product to anyone.	-1
Im sorry, but I am just not buying the whole from the French volcanoes thing. I like a few of the VICHY products, but VICHY MINERALIZING THERMAL WATER SOOTHING FOR FACE, FROM THE FRENCH VOLCANOES, 1.69 FL OZ is not one of them. Though a VERY cute little container, I find is not so pleasant to spray liquid on my face. For me, it feels no different then splashing water on my face.  Product Description Vichy Mineralizing Thermal Water enriched with 15 rare minerals. 15 clinical studies have proven the skin health benefits of Vichy Mineralizing Thermal Water.

Today, Vichy is the #1 Anti-Aging Brand in European pharmacies.	-1
I really can't tell the difference when using this, I haven't used it every single day, but I haven't noticed a change in my skin or really the way it feels. It is a little refreshing, but I think I can probably get the same thing from spraying water on my face. I forgot to double check the price, but unless the long term is beneficial and very beneficial, i can't see myself purchasing this on the regular.  I've only tried one other Vichy product and I like it, so I guess its what you looking for.	-1
I do like most La Roche-Posay products however I am not fond of this. It has a texture of creamy vasoline.  It has a nice, faint smell to it however it does not lather up.  I feel it does not cleanse my face very well. I feel like it just moves around the makeup and it does not get off my primer on my eyes. I have to use 3 pumps of this to put on my entire face to cleanse but it doesn't leave my face feeling refresh and clean. I will not purchase this product again because of these things.	-1
Bottom of my list for eye liners.  Not only is this LaRoche-Posay Respectissime Soft Eyeliner difficult to apply on my "older" eyes, it smudges BADLY after a couple of hours of use, and is hard to remove.  The only thing 2 positive things I can say about this La Roche-Posay soft pencil eyeliner is that the color is a good, dark black & my sensitive eyes did not react from its application (however, my sensitive eyes did not like all the make-up remover I had to use to remove the black liner).  One try & done.  This eyeliner pencil is going into the trash.	-1
I love the idea of all natural products however I do not like the applicator. The eyeliner seems nice, velvety and smooth with a very nice deep black color but it's overshadowed by the fact that I can't master this very tiny wispy brush applicator. If you're used to a velvet type applicator this may be tough for you to master.	-1
This didn't work as well as Id hoped barely any results buy the drying mask instead it works better and its cheaper  The drying mask smells bad but theres more cell turnover and more noticeable results	-1
This is the first Bioderma product I'm just not a huge fan of. I should start by saying it works really, really well - if you have dry skin, it immediately goes to work and makes your skin feel relieved and moisturized. I really like the pump as well, and the cream never gets clogged. It also glides onto your skin easily, so you don't even need a full pump to cover your face.  My biggest disappointment is how sticky I find it. My own hair will stick to my face after I apply this cream; it's uncomfortable-feeling	-1
It feels like petroleum jelly. it leaves sticky residue on the skin, and it stays sticky for hours. No wonder - the main ingredient after water is mineral oil.  Ugh. It didn't do much to my very dry flaky patches, although in those places, more of the cream got absorbed, and didn't feel as sticky.	-1
There have been lots of things on the news about sunscreens lately and how most of the Amazon reviews concentrate on the smell, not effectiveness. Well, I have no way of knowing if this is really SPF 30, but I can see that it is not full-spectrum, which is considered important by those that know these things. It does smell fine - like sunscreen ;-). I will use it for times I may not normally use sunscreen - quick trips to the store, etc., but won't count on it for a day at the beach. It is only 4 ounces, which is is less than three of the recommended 1.5 ounce (shot glass) applications, so it will be gone soon.  This is definitely not worth the money.	-1
Not my favorite.  Very, very sheer and blah.  However, if one paints this on another grey it adds a nice touch.	-1
I bought a couple velour mitts on Amazon and they were thick and the tanner application was effortlessly flawless.  These are NOT like those...  I was expecting the same thick 2 sided mitts but these are extremely thin and more like a foam material.  They don't apply self tanner well and I was covered in streaks.  Nooooooo...  I'm so disappointed in this one!	-1
I guess that I do not have the sophistication to appreciate a $18 can of mineral water that has 10.1 ounces in it. I used this product as directed and nothing..It is refreshing to spray on your face when it is clean, but I think that I can get the same effect by taking a spray bottle and using some good ol American mineral water.  I am not sure why the French mineral water is so much better than mineral water made any place else, but for 25 cents for a 20 ounce bottle compared to $18 I think that I will buy American mineral water. I am also a believer that your skin must be hydrated from the inside out. You can spray the entire can on your whole body, but if you have not put fluids inside your body, it is not going to do any good.  My entire family gets together on the 4th of July for a pool party and I plan to use the VICHY spray to keep me cool while Im sitting outside in the heat by the pool and plan to drink lots and lots of water to keep me hydrated.	-1
I had a horrible experience with this. I used a mitt to apply it (provided free from the company). It seemed to go on even, but the results were blotchy and gross. Most of it faded away within a week, but I still have blotches around my ankles, and it has been over three weeks since I tried it.  The one good thing I can say is that it smells amazing. I would buy a lotion with this scent, but I will never try another tanner from this company again.	-1
Wasn't as sticky as the other brands but it felt funny after it evaporated... Not what's I would say is comfortable. I usually use put distilled water into a spray bottle but thought I would try the entire line. Did not like the brand any longer but I have used it in the past. It's not consistent, possible change in formulation.  ..	-1
This product is really a joke! It does nothing and I wasted my money on the whole line like a fool! I was trusting. I wish I could get my money back!	-1
This did not work as it claimed	-1
Not my cup of tea...and as several others have said, you'd think its more for an older lady...but, THAT being said, I AM an older lady...and I really do not care for it...its like it was designed for women in the 1940's or something. It's just not light enough or interesting enough that I would care to ever wear it again. I know that scents are like anything else, its all a personal choice, that's why I gave it 2 stars vs 1 star.	-1
This sounded like a fragrance I'd like - it contains notes that have been in other perfumes I've worn - so I thought it might be something nice to try for spring. It didn't smell anything like what the description sounds like. It's close to something or more accurately, many things my grandmother wore. It's slightly peppery, sharp and medicinal and has that undefinable something that just says, "grandma." I initially sprayed a little on my wrists and neck to test it out and the smell was so strong and irritating that I ended up washing it off a half hour later.  The bottle is pretty inexpensive looking. It's textured glass with a big ball cap. There's no pretty shape or design to it, things I'd expect from a scent  at this price point.  If you're looking for a perfume that screams "grandma!" for someone special, then this is a perfect choice.  (I should add that I'm not far off from my own AARP membership so the title is kind of tongue in cheek)	-1
Quality of the polish is fine however the color is much darker than the image suggest and does not really look green at all.	-1

I haven't noticed any change in my skin, so I wonder if it actually does anything?  Love to see some results, but not seeing them after weeks of use.  I could think of a better way to spend my money, candidly.  2 stars because I question whether it does anything.	-1
I've heard great things about Strivectin over the years, so my experience might be atypical. I've been using it for over  three weeks an neither I nor my husband has seen any difference in my skin.	-1
I first tried it inside the house at night and it had a nice feel to it. Light and fresh, but not really cooling per say. The shimmer was not too intense, but that was only under the bathroom lighting.  Outside in the daylight is an entire story, I put it on my forearm and with the light hitting it, it was full blown glitter and shimmer. I don't know if I could ever wear this on a casual day to "highlight" my tan. I don't have much a tan anyways, but this would definitely make me seem like I doused myself with glitter rather than highlight any tan of mine. It does not seem to have cooling properties either or none that I could feel. It's similar to misting yourself with water on a hot day. It's certainly does not have a cooling effect like the coolness of toothpaste on the skin for example.  A bottle of overpriced glitter liquid? In my book yes and I would see no reason to buy it. I'll probably just use the rest of the bottle to reenact some Twilight scenes for my amusement. It's kinda interesting to see yourself in the mirror sparkle, but it does not serve it's original purpose of cooling or highlighting any tan. Unless they mean highlight yourself with sparkles.	-1
I purchased this and the cream Vichy roll-on deodorants to compare the two. While this one is easier to apply (it has a roller ball which the cream version doesnt) and dries faster, this made me break out in a rash which the other didnt. Something is different in their ingredients that made this one cause a rash.	-1

This product is little more than olive oil and a few preservatives in a bottle with a mediocre applicator.  Does it remove makeup?  Sure, any oil will remove most makeup.  Is it worth $20?  Absolutely not.  $2, maybe.  If you're looking for a much better portable makeup remover which actually has a precision applicator, I would recommend the ELF makeup remover pen.	-1
I wanted to love this product!  I love olive oil and the thought of using a natural product opposed to other make-up removers with additives really bloated this product to be something greater in my mind than it actually was.  First off the packaging is horrendous.  You receive this tiny package which can mistakenly be thrown away.  The wand is not removable/replaceable which is pretty disgusting to say the least.  The other applicators cannot be continuously re-used and are the equivalent of cheap cotton swabs.  The actual olive oil that you receive is such a small amount compared to the excessive price, and it has additives.  It is not completely natural.  The actual product can correct smudges from my liquid eyeliner but I can also do that with my Dermologica make-up remover and cotton swabs that are disposable!  This is nothing special.  If necessary you can bring it with you to keep in your purse but not at this price.  It is just too expensive for what it actually is.  I found that it would also leave a shiny sticky film which would need to be dried and cleaned if I wanted to reapply my liner.  Do not recommend for use in your bathroom.  Your current product is doing the same thing.  I do not see how re-using a dirty wand would be all right.  Not worth it; look elsewhere.	-1
I do not like how it smell, but I did gave several tries to see if my hair improves. But with my long hair, it actually made it tangled so bad that my hair fell out as I pulled hard. Not a good product.	-1
wow, for the price we were shocked with the quality of the actual pieces.  the nail clippers did nto really clip, the filer was okay and will not be used often and that left us with the nose-hair trimmer .. that worked and lovely leather case.  Cant say that is worth the price!  much disappointed and expected so much more from Henckels.	-1

This would have been a 4-star review if the thing didn't stop working after a couple of months (and I'm noticing this is a pattern with this product, based on the reviews). At first, it worked great, making thick, luscious curls that made me feel like a romance heroine. And then...nothing. It just stopped heating up and my dreams of being a romance novel cover heroine were dashed. Alas.	-1
Doesnt make curls even remotely close to the pictures. Its also only got two settings - off and the surface of the sun. Didnt even try the glove because you can get great waves from other tools without wearing a glove. Pass on this crazy tool.	-1
It chip My wife nails in a day. If you have a nail gel nail dryer? Then stick with or go with the gel nail polish. It last longer than this stuff.	-1
I don't think it does the job . It is definitely a lower voltage than the main heads ... i have the trinity and i will be purchasing the mini for this reason . The mini seems to be working better around the eyes and lip area vs this attachment that does nothing in my opinion . The main heads definitely work .	-1
I found this to be a very HEAVY fragrance and I didn't smell anything that resembled cotton. The packaging is nice, and it looks like a great gift as long as you don't mind a very heavy, strong scent. The smell wasn't exactly unpleasant but it wasn't what I would imagine at all from reading the description and being highly sensitive I found it overwhelming. If you are expecting a "soft sensual" fragrance I believe this is mislabeled!! Beware!	-1
