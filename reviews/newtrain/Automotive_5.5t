I used this to try breaking free some stuck piston rings in my non turbo S60 Volvo. I poured Sea Foam directly into the cylinder through the spark plug hole, about 1/2 oz in each cylinder. One thing to check is the engines are not always installed vertically on a car - on my S60 the engine is tilt about 15 degrees backwards. Same goes for V6 engines. It is important the car be parked on an incline so as to have the cylinders that undergo this treatment, perfectly vertical so the fluid leaks over all sections of the rings. The way I did the treatment, is let the engine soak for at least 3 days. Then I turned a little the engine without starting to move a bit each piston, and poured again the Seam Foam inside and let it soak another 3 days. I've repeated all this a few times, without driving the car in this period. At the end I put new oil/filter, drove the car and revved it a little. The engine certainly got some extra torque and it sounds a bit different, in a good way. The treatment certainly helped a bit with my stuck piston rings. I am sure, it didn't dislodge all rings. This treatment will never be helpful for very gummed piston rings because the fluid cannot access properly to the piston groove, especially on the lower compression ring. A few side notes. This treatment is better done in cold winter days, because the lower temperature causes the piston to shrink while the rings will shrink less as they are made of steel instead of alloy. This may help increase the space between the ring and the piston allowing the fluid to penetrate there easier. I didn't got any check engine light using this. I've also used Sea Foam inside the crankcase. I wanted to see if it can clean a hydraulic lifter stuck with sludge that was causing a valve tapping. The valve makes less noise now. I don't think it's useful to drive the car with Sea Foam in the crankcase, because Sea Foam evaporates quickly at temperature and may become less efficient. Instead (for hydraulic lifters) I think it's better to pour a can or so inside the crankcase, run the engine for a few seconds then shut it off and let it sit a few days. This way, the Sea Foam will get inside the lifters and start working. Don't drive the car during this period because there is too much Sea Foam in the oil, and change the oil/filter before driving the car again.  Edit:  I just found the seals on the oil cooler started to leak, right after the treatment.  This is an old car, but still the Sea Foam can attack some of the rubber seals.  better not leave it in the oil engine longer than a few days.	1
supposed to be good quality over autoparts brand but now way for me to check. Added on 2 cars that my family owns and would recommend to others without hesitation if one doesnt have the money to buy mastercool/robinair/... Important part of the process is to properly vacuum for a decent amount of time. I will add pictures of what the oil looks like later. and very good price most repair shop tends to go for cheapest oil that's available but fjc, as much as i know, holds a decent quality control in the hvac (not the best in hvac industry but good enough for diyers).	1
Less $ than Auto-Zone brand. Would be nice if the bottle had a translucent strip with the "ounces" marked. Other than that, good product.	1
THANK YOU	1
Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks	1
was just what needed	1
Purchased this when I bought a 4 seasons Compressor as I thought they shipped dry.  97 mountaineer	1
It Is what it is... oil but it works and price is good.	1
needed to lubricate new o-rings and other AC system parts in a 2000 dodge.  good size and good value.	1
Good	1
is fine	1
Worked fine, very happy.	1
Just the correct amount, no waste	1
As advertised	1
The price is right. Oil is oil so I don't foresee any issues.	1
Did the job.	1
This stuff is magic. I noticed a difference after 15 minutes of running my lawn mower.	1
Excellent product	1
works as advertised!	1
good stuff	1
I strongly recommend buying this set of tools, even if you use it just once. Well worth the time savings if you reverse the wires in the plug or just need to repair or replace an existing wire. I had a polarity issue with a strobe light and had to switch the wires. Opened the plug up and inserted this tool into the male prong and easily removed the wire and fitting without any damage to it. Switched the wires around and they seated just like a first time install. Dont think twice about it, just move forward and buy it...you won't be sorry	1
liked	1
Nice tools for the price, good enough for occasional use for the shade tree mechanic.	1
Too thick to fit into an average size connector cavity let alone pick the terminals.	-1
Reasonable quality and work as expected.	1
great little tools to have around!	1
Good oil. Seemed like an oz short though.	1
My 1995 Camaro Air Conditioner compressor needed this oil. No complaints so far.	1
Worked Perfect!	1
Nice and oily!	1
Just what I needed when I replaced the AC Compressor on my car.	1
Great product, Great Price and Fast Shipping. Replaced a Compressor, Drier, Condenser, and Expansion valve. Used this oil and everything works fine! 1994 Toyota T100	1
If you are buying compressor oil you likely already know what you are doing.  Works as expected, there are no ratings out there that say brand X is better than Y, or that they are all made in the same place.  This product doesnt come with any fancy stickers for the edge of your windshield, therefore you should use this product without hesitation.  Check with the compressor to make sure you get the correct weight.	1
it works great!	1
I was a little skeptical about this product and how it could help. I have an older well maintained vehicle and decided to try this in conjunction with seafoam aerosol. I just did a bit of traveling and my mileage increase about 25%! I'm going to do another cleaning treatment and then keep up with it once a year or so.	1
Amazing produce great price	1
Just what I was looking for, these tools make the job so much easier. A great buy	1
as expected thank you!	1
They work well for my needs.	1
works	1
Just the tools you need when working with electronics parts/fittings, could be a little longer.	1
Appears that they will do the job. Hadn't had chance to use them yet.	1
Works great for removing pins in both Weatherpack connectors and in standard relays, (all I've needed/used it for so far).	1
Ive tired them all. Water based formulas are the way to go. In the long run, any silicone based products degrade leather. With this conditioner it offers rejuvenation and some protection without doing harm or turning your seats into a human fly trap. It smells really good and leaves the leather looking legitimately "new". Ridiculously simply to apply.  Only downside I can think of is no explicit UV protection. Sun, even more than melted ice cream and greasy silicone, is leather's worst enemy.	1
Works just fine, as advertised	1
Helped improve emissions test.	1
GREAT Stuff	1
Good stuff, good price, fast delivery.	1
These will be useful when setting up wire connections with Weatherpack connectors for those jobs like hooking up fog, driving or off road lights.	1
All was good	1
Tools have worked good, handle looks inexpensive but have had no problems.	1
The perfect tool, I thought I could change the connections on whether pack connectors without a special tool, no way are you going to change these pins without, the proper weather pack tool. I received my toolkit. I promptly went out to the shop, and started removing pins from weather pack connections that I had retrieved from the junkyard. Push the tool in pin comes out, so easy I can't believe why I didn't purchased this tool in the first place. Without this tool I was never able to remove the pins. So if you have to change over whether pack connections in your vehicle purchase this toolkit it's well worth the money.	1
These work very well.	1
Works very well!	1
Always fun to see the smoke show. Be sure to let the car stand for 15 minutes after your pour the treatment into the brake booster line and before turning the car back on.	1
worked good	1
just what you need not to mess up the terminals...	1
great	1
These tools allow for removal of Delta style connectors on my Chevrolet, without them the plastic housings for the electrical pin type connectors are damaged if a screw driver is used or something similar. Price was right. Not made in the USA.	1
could not live without them	1
great price great value got all 3 for the price of 1 elsewhere. A must when doing any auto gm wiring.	1
Cheap cheerful and useful for unpinning electrical connections on my car. Have used them in three projects so far. Shipped very fast	1
Love the new leather smell, does make my leather seat softer and moise but not wet.	1
amazing on our gray leather airplane seats.  scrubbed all six with a small brush and this product.  wiped down after scrubbing, and amazed how much dirt was in them....proud again of our seats	1
Works Great! . apply and sit on in minutes.	1
This stuff is amazing. I run a bottle through my boat every year.	1
Helped my injectors on a 1999 Dodge RAM 2500 5.9L Diesel. After 189,000 miles, it was either change the injectors or clean 'em up. This product has worked well.	1
Does as advertised, had issues with my truck and this can aided in the repair. Now I have this in stock for the future.	1
cans are dented as they said. only problem is I didn't buy all that were available	1
Work great for old ford taurus	1
This stuff is magic.  Watch the videos on Utube.	1
This stuff just works! Follow the instructions and run cleaner, leaner, with better performance, and mileage.	1
Great product, Great price	1
Using it to treat my house for voter gasoline. Won't know for a while whether it works or not	1
I've been using Sea Foam products for years. They are as good as you can get.	1
Worked as expected	1
I have used this as preventative maintenance in my vehicles every other oil change.  While I can't say with certainty how well it is actually working, I can say that I have had no major engine issues with any of my vehicles that have ever received a treatment.  I have also used this as an additive to the gasoline for my lawnmower.  When I first began using it, my mower would not start without the aid of starting fluid sprayed directly into the carburetor.  The spark plugs had to be changed every 3 months or so because they kept fouling up.  After 2-1/2 gallons of gas (approximately 5 full tanks) treated with Sea Foam per it's directions, the mower slowly started to improve.  First it would start after 3 or 4 pulls of the cord.  After a couple of more runs, it started every 2 or 3 pulls.  The last time I mowed it started up on the first pull.	1
I agree with most of the other reviewers here. The Duragloss 221 conditioner is great stuff. I use it on my 2011 Ford Expedition King Ranch and it, along with the Duragloss 441 shampoo, keeps my Chaparral King Ranch leather seats looking great. Smells good too.	1
If you love the smell of the king ranch leather in Ford trucks this is the stuff to buy.  The leather conditioner works good and make my truck leather smell like it's factory new.  I have a 2007 king ranch and to this day it still smells like factory new leather.  The seat look great and the leather is holding up.  I hand apply this once a month and I have had no problems.  This did not change the color of my leather and I would recommend to any king ranch owner.	1
THIS is the go-to leather cleaner.  It is *EXACTLY* what Zaino leather conditioner used to be years ago before they watered down their formula.  It leaves the leather super soft and smelling amazing.  This will be in my detail cabinet for years to come and I plan to buy a few extra to have some in stock.	1
works great on my 2006 Nissan Altima.	1
proven product works well	1
I have used sea foam a few times it usually does a good job.	1
Really works as advertised!!	1
This is a miracle for old engines. Increases engine performance.	1
i used this with a windshield ACI spray kit which I turned into an intercooler sprayer, it's perfect for what I use it for!	1
muy bueno es lo que buscaba excelente producto lo recomendare a otros porque en estos tiempos hay que estar seguro de lo que se compra	1
this fit my application just fine. came to me fast and no problems using it. there is a vent hole in the top for pressure release	1
I've used many leather products but after I found the duraglass line I've not used or will I use anything else.	1
I agree with most of the other reviewers here. This stuff is amazing. I use it on my 2015 F150 King Ranch and it, along with the shampoo, keeps my seats looking and smelling terrific. Fresh baseball glove terrific.  I'm sticking with 221 and will continue to smile each time I use it given the money I am saving over the KR brand that is soo much more expensive.  Put on your rubber gloves and massage this stuff in yours and you will too.	1
I love this stuff. I think it's the best on the market, doesn't make your leather look cheap and plastic like. People always comment on how my interior looks and smells like new leather. Now using it on my 5th vehicle with premium leather, you'll never switch.	1
Smells great like a leather shop and it definitely works great	1
I love the smell cum protect well in my car -leather cushion & home - Sofa too.!	1
Use this about once per week on leather interior. Once it dries, no oily residue. Makes leather soft	1
Good product..	1
Great stuff - if your check engine light comes on, put a can of this in the gas tank and see if it doesn't fix whatever ailed the engine. First I replaced all spark plugs. Next I replaced all spark plug wires. Then I started to replace every coil - 6 @ $50 each - when someone said try this product. A can into the gas tank fixed the problem and the check engine light went off after a few starts. I guess I could have saved a bunch of money if I had just put this in first.	1
It does get the job done when used the way it should be used.	1
I bought this product based on rave reviews on how well it cleans out fuel systems and carbs.  My experience was not so good.  I used as per directions on an ATV.  It did not work.  I should have taken it to the shop and had the carb cleaned or replaced.  It may work better on moderately or less sensitive systems.	-1
Excellent product, quality, and i don't have any bad comment for this product, it just what I was looking for	1
I purchased Trico Exact-Fit blades for one vehicle so far and they work fine. Perfect match so they were easy to replace, and they work fine. So far I cannot tell any difference in performance compared to OEM.	1
As it turns out, I didn't NEED to order this cap, as the recovery tank I ordered COMES with it's own cap, but they don't show one in the picture or tell you that a cap is included. Cheap enough. I'll just hold onto it for now.	1
its a cap	1

I use this for conditioning the leather seats in my Prius.  The product is rather oily at the beginning, and the seats will be wet to the touch right after application. But after 15 minute or so, the leather absorbs the liquid and the final feel isn't oily or sticky at all.  While cleaning seats, be sure to buy a bottle of Folex carpet stain remover here on Amazon.  That stuff works wonders for removing stains from the Prius carpet.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILA3YY?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_42  Recommended!	1
I have always liked this leather conditioner. I have tried some of the other highly rated brands and always come back to Duragloss 221/222. It does not leave an oily or waxy feel to the leather and smells wonderful.  It is not the easiest product to find locally, so thanks to Amazon I can stay stocked.	1
Nothing negative to report about this product. I used this product on a "10 Camaro SS LS3, and it worked remarkably removing grime from the top portion of the engine. I put the cleaning solution in 1k miles prior to motor oil change.	1
Honda 900rr 1. Noticible change in the idle after 2 treatments 2. Change your spark plugs after using or risk failure 3. Do not use in oil unless you change is VERY quickly 4. You will have to check your clutch if used in oil Overall very satisfied.  Did not run full diagnostics or a dyno to check for any gains.  Expect a cleaner system, don't expect massive power.  Part of a maintenance regiment not a power enhancement program.	1
Always works well.	1
I decided to give this product a try after my motorcycle kept giving me about 50-55 miles per tank.  That is really bad I know! After researching and reading for reasons why this might be happening I came across with people using sea Foam and they say they can't live without.  I can safely say that I am on the same boat as them.  I went and filled up my tank, poured the amount of Sea Foam I needed and continued on my day.  Fast forward a week later and I was doing 95 miles without having to turn on my reserve tank yet! The sea foam truly does clean out any junk in your carbs and anywhere else in the fuel line.	1
Fit and work just like the ones from the dealer (without the dealer price tag!)  Couldn't be happier!  For the record, I am using these on my 2016 Hyundai Veloster.	1
Very easy to install and work perfectly! I like the way that on Amazon, you can put in your year, make & model of car and they tell you the exact parts and accessories for your car!  Thank you, Amazon!	1
I got these to replace the wipers on my 2003 Toyota Matrix. Really only the rear windshield needed replacing but I figured it would be best to go ahead and do all of them as the same time. Not much to say about them, but they work great. They aren't fancy or have special features or anything, but they certainly work better than the last ones I had on there. They went on quickly and easily and fit great.	1
A quality wiper blade setup for my GMC truck. Will buy again. Fast shipping.	1
fits the dodge great Love the snap fit wipes well good construction for the money spent love it	1
Seem better made than Anco ones I've been using. Easier installation too.	1
Wasn't sure if the Dorman overflow bottle came with a cap (it did) so ordered to have on hand just in case. This cap is vented, where the cap that came with the bottle is not, so if my truck ever overheated, the bottle will vent.	1
I ordered this for a Buick Reagl I'm restoring. Fits perfect. Easy to read lettering.	1
Worked great	1
Works fine.	1
Perfect fit.	1
good stuff	1
After proceeding a deep cleaning of the seats of a 15 years old car I recently purchased, seats which didn't see much care all theses years, I used Duragloss' Leather Conditioner #221 to rehydrate the leather.  The cleaning turned the dark gray, almost black and shiny leather into a uniform middle gray, only slightly brilliant surface, like it supposed to be but I could feel it was dry.  After letting dry the seats for a few days, I applied a thin coat of Duragloss, just to see that only after a few minutes the leather had suck all the cream. I then applied a thicker coat of product, directly with the fingers on the whole surface and even a third one in some dryer areas.  After a few hours I wiped out the excess with three old cotton t-shirts and got back the non-shiny and natural aspect of the original. The leather is now smooth and supple. And the smell -wow!- is awesome, like the leather of a brand new car.  I used once in an other car a leather conditioner which contained silicon and it was a nightmare: the leather was shiny, greasy, slippery and I could see the product clearly wasn't hydrating the leather. Nothing like that with the Duragloss 221. The cream is very easy to apply, penetrates the leather to hydrate it, doesn't leave it shiny nor greasy or sticky and is easy to take off the hands simply with clear water.  Now, after four months, the smell is almost gone and I can see the leather needs again to be re-hydrated but that's not a surprise knowing it passed 15 years without care and that I live in a dry area with less than 30% humidity, and I will definitively use again this excellent product.  Highly recommended!  Note that if you have leather seats with little holes, avoid using creamy conditioner like this one and prefer a liquid one in spray which will not clog the holes with white product.	1
I have used this on my Jaguar for many years, and the leather still looks new after 15 years! Most leather cracks within a couple years, but this really works great, and makes the car smell like real new leather!	1
Stuff has worked great for my OBD II error codes re: Sensors / Oxygen.	1
As expected.	1
Does what it says!	1
I always like to use seafoam to tune up engines, never feel disappointment. Great product for garage hobby!	1
very  good	1
They fit.  They work. I can see in the rain when I drive.	1
I installed these in a 1987 Cadillac Brougham and they work great. She doesn't see much rain these days as she is only driven on the weekends, but she is covered very well by these TRICO's. Thanks!	1
Good blade for the money!	1
quality & easy to install.	1
VERY GOOD QUALITY	1
Fit my NA Mazda Miata great. They work very well too. No matter how much water is on my windshield they wipe it dry first sweep.	1
All good	1
This coolant cap was a pretty good value when you compare it to what the restoration suppliers charge. GM used these for many years on a number of different vehicles. I bought for a 80's vehicle I am restoring. Seems the same as the original.	1
Geat product	1
great deal with fair price , I like it & will recommend it for all of my friends , thanks	1
Very easy to install	1
An exact fit as advertised.	1
Perfect fit for my vehicle. I was leary at first that it would be correct, but it arrived and is not only the correct size, but the correct attachment. There is no need to switch it out with some adapter or cheap component that fails after a week.	1
They fit, they work and they're cheaper than in the store.  They work well on my 2001 Tundra,  2007 Corolla but not on my 2012 Priius	1
Best wiper blade I've ever owned. These Trico blades remove ALL the water from my windshield with every pass, leaving no streaks or missed spots. Will definitely be buying again!!! I've owned other brands over the years, but these are the first to clear 100% of the water, right out of the box (the other brands would leave streaks in spots and require some adjustment to minimize the width of the streaks).	1
Fit as advertised and easy to install. Quality is near the top end for the price.	1
This is a tune-up in a can. Great stuff.	1
Used in engine oil in my 2005 Toyota Sienna 300 miles before an oil change. Also use it in my motorcycles.	1
Found out that Max Purple does a better job than Sea Foam.  I have nothing against it.  It's like picking the Blackberry or the Iphone.  They both work, but one is just clearly better.	1
Seems working but not 100% sure it solved the problem. Half bottle goes to the engine through vacuum pipe, half pours directly to the tank. got some white smog out of the exhaustion pipe. I thought I felt the engine running smoother than before but not significantly. May do the same procedure again then I'm afraid it is going to clog up catalytic converter. Need to research more	1
Seafoam is great. I put one full can in my gas tank after each oil change and my car runs great. The full 3 way treatment yields even better results but is not always needed on newer vehicles.	1
saves alot of my motors- use on generators-atv-chainsaw. all over ranch.	1
Exact Fit.	1
As described, very nice I highly recommended it!	1
So far so good (with a small amount of rain). I'll write back after we have taken our SUV in the snow.  Very easy to install.	1
Excellent	1
These are all I will use from now on, they have lasted over 6 months and still wipe cleanly. Highly recommend.	1
Always use seafoam in my gas tank. 2010 nissan xterra .. gas mileage is always better with this stuff	1
Satisfied	1
Cleaned my motor right out runs like a charm I swear by this stuff	1
I Used this formula to clean my 14 year old mercedes manifold and head gaskets with out any trouble. It cleans the gunk and residue well and easily. There is not much of a sparkle, its mot corrosive, but it is as safe as can be since its a motor treatment !!!!	1
I've been using seafoam for years. Great in the gas tank, the oil and intake (the spray is convenient). I ran about 1/3-1/4 of a bottle through the crankcase of a four cylinder that took 4quarts of oil. After about 120 miles I changed the oil and cut open the filter. I saw a few small chunks of crud that was likely sludge/buildup in the bottom of the filter. I'm sure the filter caught a lot more.	1
This cleaner is the best that I know of, and at an excellent price.	1
Still going strong.	1
Easy to install.	1
These wiper blades fit my 2010 Ford Ranger perfectly.  Thank-You!	1
easy to install, does terrific job.	1
good price and lasts a year	1
Poor quality.  I bought these wiper blades for my 2007 Honda Odyssey.  They fit perfectly but didn't last long.  After a few months they started to skip terribly.  They made a terrible noise and wouldn't clear the windshield very well.  It was tricky when it started happening during a strong downpour.  I quickly replaced them with some Rain-X blades from my local big box store.  I am very unhappy with these wiper blades.  I usually buy&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Valeo-60017-Series-Wiper-Blades/dp/B000CDCDHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Valeo 60017 Series Wiper Blades</a>&nbsp;but Amazon didn't have the right size for my Odyssey at the time so I tried the Trico blades.  Big mistake.	-1
Wiper broje first time used  went straight to trash!	-1
Well made. Good price. Fit perfectly on two year old Mazda CX-5 which needs a 24", an 18" and a 14" replacement blade. Easy to install. Good investment for your vision, safety, and to work properly when there is rough weather.	1
Fit perfect on a 1994 Toyota land cruiser. great value for money	1
In 3 months of barely being used, it started to streak very badly. Replaced them with Bosch Icon. Will never buy Trico again.	-1
Trico is supposed to be a good brand, but I don't think these are.  I installed a pair less than six months ago on my Ranger.  At night in a driving rain storm the plastic part that connects the blade to the arm failed (or perhpas the pin backed out of the blade).  Fortunately I had a little residual Rainx on the glass, otherwise I would have had to stop.  Even more fortunately I was able to immediately turn off the wipers before scratching the windshiled.  Does anyone still make replaceable blades?  Perhaps it is better too buy really good ones and just replace the rubber part??	-1
Always a good product and always cheaper on Amazon!	1
I use sea foam once every 3-5k miles and have the cleanest injectors my mechanic has ever seen on a vehicle with 40k miles and never been serviced for fuel injector cleaning. This really saves money in the long run and stabilizes the fuel as well. Like running premium gas periodically and skipping the $200 service that the dealer charges. If you're not convinced, look up "Chris Fix" on YouTube as he proves it works with a telescopic camera. Highly recommended.	1
stuff works as advertised. stopped the ticking on my avalanche and cleaned out my crank case too. already bought more for the other cars. 10 stars, seriously.	1
Makes your engine run like new with interval repetitive use.	1
I've always found this product to work well and do what it is engineered to do. Highly recommend!	1
Love the product!	1
worked as expected	1
I've used these for years and have always had an "exact fit" and perfect wiper action.  This is not the best wiper blade replacement...it is the ONLY wiper blade replacement!	1
Instructions were clear enough, fits my 2006 Vibe perfectly.  Great wiper, great deal.	1
great value	1
The only motor/gas treatment that goes in my boat. I stock up in the winter when the price is under 7 dollars. Price will spike in the summertime.	1
this is defintely "the stuff" you want to use to clean carbs without having to take them off...after a winter of sitting a tank of gas with this added will restore your ride..I'm talking motorcycles here..to like new conditions..well fuel wise...	1
You either believe in this product, or you don't.  I believe and have been using it for 5 years.  I use it for winter storage for all my toys and add it every 3rd tank to my vehicles.  I can really see quite a difference in my toys when starting them after winter storage.	1
Sea foam is great ... A little cheaper than locals and I did not have to leave the house	1
Sea foam is sea foam.	1
The stuff is the best on the market.  Everything else is just an imitation.  I use for everything from my diesel truck to marine motors to chainsaws	1
As described and shipped quickly.	1
OEM replacement windshield wipers for my '94 Ford F150. Perfect fit.	1
Fits and works ok	1
Fit and operation is very good.	1
Works like my original wipers, which I loved.  Very satisfied.	1
Cheap quality. If any debris from plants or trees get on these wipers they streak the whole windshield. Spend a few extra dollars and get a decent wiper blade.	-1
Excellent	1
SeaFoam -- used by the pros to keep the fuel system clean and remove engine deposits for decades. Just what's needed to protect engines that are required to run ethanol gasolines that cause gummy fuel injectors and carburetor passages.   I live in a "smog-controlled area" where E-10 and E-15 ethanol gasoline is mandatory. At 150,000 miles, my engine starts instantly, idles smoothly, and delivers excellent fuel mileage, thanks to SeaFoam. I use a 12-oz. of can of Seafoam in the gas tank before every 5,000-mile Oil Filter change to fight gummy fuel injectors -- but I DON'T put it in the engine oil or spray it into the air intake. Modern, full-synthetic engine oils require NO additives of any kind, and spraying "magic juice" into the air intake just makes a lot of smoke and   a big cloud of air pollution.  There are other products that do a better job of cleaning carburetors and throttle bodies -- such as "CRC Mass Air Flow Sensor Cleaner", and "CRC Throttle Body Cleaner", which comes in a 2-pack kit with one can of each fluid included -- also available at Amazon.  Remember, the SeaFoam doesn't do ANYTHING to clean your Mass Air Flow Sensor -- it takes a different product for that purpose.	1
My 4 lawn mowers, 4x4, truck, car, van . . . I swear by this. If it takes gasoline, I put Sea Foam in the fuel.	1
Great.	1
I've been using Sea Foam for several years.  I put it in the gas for chainsaw, blower, generator, boat and occasionally in my car and truck. This will not turn to gel like Stabil.  It will clean your fuel system and your gas tools will start right up even after months.  I am a believer!	1
Excellent stuff! Keeps engines running great, and fuel stabilized. Use it in all my small engines!	1
I mix this stuff with all my gas for various equipment to stabilize the fuel.	1
I have been using this in fuel for years and it works well for cleaning out fuel systems. I decided to try it in my oil like they suggest your should do.  After about 5 minutes of the car running I lost oil pressure and the engine needs a rebuild now.  If your car has a lot of miles I would not suggest using this in your oil.  It seems too aggressive for a high mileage car.	-1
Have used for years.  Never have had anything clogged to see if it really cleans it out.  But then again I have used Sea Foam so maybe it is working.  It doesn't cost much and it sure is fun to produce a sea foam cloud through the neighborhood once a year.	1
Does what it's supposed to do	1
Good price and great product for small engine maintenance	1
Iv used this in my vehicles, boat and lawn mower.  I can't say I have seen any huge difference but it does seem help make the engine run a litte better and restore lost mph on older high milage vehicles.  Also help preserve gas.	1
as expected.	1
Used seafoam in the gas tank and in the oil per the instructions on the can.  Made the car run smoother and quiter then before.	1
It was okay, but it is hardly the miracle cure all folks claim it to be.  I finally broke down and cleaned out the carburetor manually.	1
I have a 4.3 triton engine. I ran two cans of this through it, then ran one can of the ss14 , and the spark plugs came right out. I have a 2005 F150 with 127000 miles. So it sat awhile! This stuff is Awesome!	1
Absolutely no difference in the performance of a cars engine. But can be used to remove  tattoos and sweaty stuff from leather seats.	-1
I have been a very big fan of Sea Foam. I use it in all of my vehicles including my farm machinery. Some people are skeptical on just how well this works. I for one am not. I have seen the benefits of using it numerous times on my vehicles. I will even clean up the carburetors on my lawn mowers after using ethylene gasoline.	1
Simple addative that keeps our vehicles running smoothly. we use it about once a qtr added to a full tank of gas.	1
Good stuff	1
Snake oil, but it's cheap enough to not care. Change your oil, oil filter and fuel filter and you'll be fine. I used this in my motor oil and in my fuel tank. I used the spray version through my intake. No difference in anything, but then again, I wasn't trying to fix a problem. My car is working just fine at 145k miles with regular maintenance.  Despite what most will say: it's safe to use in your motor oil at the specified ratio. The dilution of oil will not cause any issues in your motor. Change your oil when it gets dirty. This just goes to show how much misinformation hovers around this product, like "spun bearings" and whatnot. Seafoam won't hurt your car, but it won't do any good, either. I cannot recommend using this at all. It's junk! All the praise is without test data, so it's just a bunch of unscientifically developed opinions.	-1
This stuff works great.  Try it you will like how it helps clean out a carburetor.	1
Great product and I have bought many more since then!	1
Fantastic product, great price, great service, would buy again.  Definitely not disappointed in the purchase!  Thank you!	1
Put this can in with about 18 gal of diesel in my 2012 Duramax, 2 days later the High Pressure fuel pump blows up and metal shavings enter entire fuel system. $6800 warranty job- new fuel pump, 8 injectors, cleaned/flushed entire fuel system. Truck only has 66,000 miles on it. Coincidence? Not sure but I certainly will never use this again as a fuel treatment. Truck ran 110% up till this point. Luckily I had 3 days warranty left on the truck when this happened! Lesson learned. If you need a diesel treatment/cleaning additive, try something serious & specialized like Stanadyne. Not this gimmick in a can. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought something like this, which apparently fixes your entire car.	-1
Woo! Is more cheap to buy this product in my local auto parts than here	-1
This stuff saved my lawnmower.  I let gas sit in it for about 10 months and tried breaking down carb and cleaning it but didn't have any luck.  Ran this through the gas tank and though I had to keep restarting the engine to force it through it eventually got it running like new.	1
Like it!	1
Great product when used as instructed, will highly recommend to use as a staggered fuel/oil treatment.	1
This stuff is awesome. Add 3oz to your engine oil 200 miles before you do an oil change and put the rest of the bottle in your gas tank. Good preventive maintenance. The seafoam aerosol spray is also good for cleaning out carbon deposits from your engine.	1
Works as expected, the best product ever.	1
Worked great and price is very much lower than retail. Great quality	1
Seafoam can work wonders for vehicles.  Doesn't do much in the fuel but when adding to the crank case or throttle body it really cleans things up. Follow your directions though!!	1
Love this stuff.	1
some people prefer Sta-bil, I prefer see from works well	1
works great	1
Cleans the sht out	1
Buy many of these Does not work	-1
This stuff works great to help keep your fuel systems clean.	1
useless	-1
Great stuff I put in my vehicles with every oil change.	1
nice product	1
Seafoam always is a good choice to keep that engine healthy. I add one of these cans to a near empty gas tank after every oil change.	1
Good price fast shipping, not much to write for the review itself as the product is the same everywhere just cheaper than in the stores if you don't know about this product start googling this stuff is fantastic I use it and all of my vehicles landscaping equipment pretty much anything with an engine	1
Had great success with this stuff. I always like to keep a bottle around in the garage when needed. Can't claim how this stuff works but I do know it does make my small engines run smother. Plenty of youtube videos on its ability. I also every once and awhile put it in my vehicles to keep those prone to clog fuel injectors clean. So far it seems to work haven't had any issues.	1
Good stuff I use it in all my Vehicles I have a 1990 Chevy truck brakes weren't working good I poured some in with brake fluid in about 40 miles brakes work like new, even put in power steering pump helped I will buy more	1
works fine!	1
Good product and much better price than the auto parts store	1
since discovering Sea Foam 5 years ago - I have purchased it multiple times (shopping around whatever best price is at the time from amazon and the local auto stores) - originally using this to help start up an old trimmer someone had improperly stored through winter, as well as an old push mower.  I've used it in cars, trucks, small engines, you name it - I've tried to clean things out with Sea Foam - I won't go as far as to say its a miracle product - but in situations where a full tear down of carb and cleaning were my only solution/fix before - this stuff has came through in the clutch more than a few times now for me.  great product.	1
arrived as advertised	1
love this product it works great	1
Works very well ... will buy again. Use this or pure Techron in your gasoline to keep fuel system clean.	1
Use this product on a regular basis. Run through oil 50 miles before a change. Through the Vacuum lines and in the gas tank. Can definitely see a improvement in performance.	1
This really works.	1
I love this stuff. I use it in my fuel, oil and to run through my vacuum system to clean intake.	1
I've been using this product, for nearly two years, and it works. I use it in my fuel system and add to crankcase; 500 miles before my oil/filter change. Nearly 100,000 miles and sounds and runs like new.	1
My car had a check engine light and my friend at autozone recommended I try this for a rough idle. I poured this into my old 96 Buick Regal on a cold Midwest November morning. The check engine light vanished. Now I ordered some more for my Toyota van and corolla. I am too afraid to pour it in the crankcase even though I should. I just pour mine into the gas tank and miracles happen. I can't explain it any other way lol.	1
This stuff is the best, I always keep it on hand, put it in your small engines before winter slosh it around to get it mixed up in the gas, run the engine for a few minutes and you are good to go the next spring, and or winter if you have a snow blower	1
good price. use in every other tank on my atv's	1
I tried this product based on a friend's recommendation. I poured half of the can into my car's recently filled fuel tank and added the remainder of the can into my car's engine oil. I really think there was a slight increase in my car's performance. Doesn't downshift on hills as much as it used to. I'll use this product again when I next change the oil.	1
The best motor treatment around! There is a reason everyone swears by this product. I use it every once and a while since i think it makes a huge difference! I use it mainly as preventative but i have heard a large number of success stories!	1
Use this a few times per year and do notice improvements in smoother engine running, especially when starting to move from a complete stop (eliminates jerking).	1
works great for cleaning carburators	1
None	1
so  nice?!!!!!!!	1
I used in my two cars and in my daughter's car and all had improvement in gas mileage. My Lexus hybrid really jumped (60,000 miles).	1
great stuff	1
If you have doubt... JUST SEAFOAM EVERYTHING. Pour half a bottle in your oil crankcase and drive about 20 miles then flush it out by doing an oil change. Pour the other half into your gas tank. Everything seemingly runs smoother now, even though it didn't help my mileage.	1
this stuff rely works every time my car has a little rough idle i trow one bottle in the tank and problem solved	1
A bottle in the tank of my 2004 dodge cummins diesel, and the engine purs and runs smoothly.  the exhaust is cleaner smelling too.  I probably put one bottle in every 10,000 miles or so, and it keeps the injectors and top end clean and clog free.	1
Great price. Fast shipping.	1
This is the best synthetic product on the market to coat and fill metal pores. My boss started his Toy truck one Monday morning after it sat over the weekend. The engine made a metallic metal-to-metal noise. He told me that the engine makes noise occasionally when it sits for a time. I told him to add Lubegard. The noise has not returned - engine protection at its finest, Thank you Lubegard techs!	1
Will buy again . I have used other products manufactured by this company and found each one to work surprisingly well	1
If you'd like some stats from someone other than a neophyte user, or the company itself, check out the tests done by [...]	1
So far I have yet to see a Lubricant perform (overall) like lubegard "bio engine". It does lower the engine temp (slightly, but better then NOT), plus it does make the engine run quieter and smoother. Nothing that i am mentioning is massively noticeable. IF you are a car enthusiast with skills, you will feel the difference.  The additive is DARK BLUE in color, so beware, it will taint your clean honey colored oil to black, like moly oil. So if you did rely on the color of your used oil to determine its life, then you will be totally turned off by it. I have tried many of the additives before (slick50, duralube, etc), and this is the only one that I KNOW that actually lowers the engine temperature slightly. The engine also even cools (when motor is off) faster than before. The price is well worth it, for what it does. And bear in mind, that I used it with my dirty oil (did NOT do an oil change) as an experiment. Folks it works. If you want that extra performance, its for you. I cannot say yet if it will extend your car/engine life - but I am willing to bet that it does. I bought 6 bottles since I got them a a steal of a price, plus I will be doing an oil change soon. Lubegard also makes tranny fliud additive too, and YES it works in that department just as well.  And don't forget, its not expensive compared to other snakeoil additives. All it takes is one try, but make sure to get your thermometer ready, before and after using it.	1
Make engine run smooth.  Working good.	1
I run this in any and everything I have that takes gas or oil. My boat loves it all the way to my Harley and mower. Store your Bike or boat in the winter with a shot glass of this in the gas to make sure it dosent go bad. Add a shot to your oil, drive around the block and then change your oil to get out that sludge build up. Like I said I always keep a bottle on hand.	1
Good treatment for fuel	1
Am going to use this to see if it'll make a difference in my lawnmower.  It's been running a bit rough lately.	1
its magic! I use it on a regular basis in my fuel for my Mercury outboard, lawn tractor, leaf blower, and Vac!	1
Bitter taste but overall not too bad tasting. Recommend with olives	1
Added Seafoam to the tank and the vaccuum line on the intake and my truck seems so run a little smoother. I have always liked the product but it is expensive. I am glad to see it on Amazon for such a good price.	1
Works great in Denver	1
Not a fan of "snake oil additives"... but I am a fan of "science and using things that work"  I bought this to try on our new 2017 Subaru Forester XT, used on the 1,000 mile break-in oil change, I have used the Bio-Tech Engine additive before several times on my fleet of vehicles always with good results, lower temps, quieter, and a bump (up) in MPG always followed after adding LubeGard products to my vehicles.  Oil temps on the Forester XT before the Liquid Wax Ester (LubeGard) added, even on colder nights (50 to 70 degree F) the oil temps would get up to 221 F (constant) with a few spikes going over 223 F a few times during driving... those numbers are with regular city/highway driving at 0 to 50 mph for the city and 65 to 75 mph on the highway and also the "spirited hard break-in procedure" runs would get no hotter then 223 for a few seconds...  So far oil temps after the LXE added has been down to 214 F no matter what I did during my tests... that's about 4% cooler oil temps... for this reason alone I will continue to use LubeGard in my Forester.  Engine is extremely quiet now, no more of that "typical boxer tick", just a smooooooth almost whisper quiet running engine... almost like a Prius :)  I will report back after several tanks of gas for a good "Fuel Economy" report but here is what data I have so far:  1st tank, 25.31 mpg 2nd tank, 26.49 mpg (had 2 ounces of Bio Plus added to the fuel) 3rd tank, 27.21 mpg (had 1 ounce of Bio Plus) 4th tank, 28.75 mpg (had 2 ounces Bio Plus, Castrol 0w-40 + LubeGard, Mobil 1 75w-90 + LubeGard, and a AEM dry flow air filter) 5th and 6th tank averaged around 30.84 mpg between them... about 22 percent better fuel economy over the first tank of fuel... everything I've done is saving me about $9 for every full tank of gas I get  5.0 quarts of Castrol Synthetic 0w-40 European Car and 0.4 quarts of LubeGard (just under 3 ounces of LubeGard per quart of oil)  After a few weeks the Temps have dropped a bit more, now oil temps rarely exceed 207 even when the outside temps hit 102	1
Good stuff! I have a 03 Mercedes with 270,000 miles. Recently the engine has developed a ticking sound in the mornings that goes away after a few minutes. Having previous experience with Lubgard's Transmission additive I decided to give this stuff a try.. Well this stuff really works! The ticking sound is gone and I even noticed the engine seems a bit quieter and a little more smoother!	1
Great product.	1
it seems to work, no break downs as of yet. thanks	1
I'm a huge fan of science and NOT a fan of virtually every other oil additive being sold today (excluding Liqui-Moly products). I choose to use top-quality synthetic engine oils (Pennzoil Platinum, PP High Mileage, and Pennz Ultra Platinum being my favorites) and I want to plainly state that there is virtually nothing that can be added to these oils that has not already been carefully included by the engineers at Pennzoil (SOPUS). However, this Lubeguard with synthetic LXE tech, is the "virtually"...the true exception.  Synthetic wax esters are a specific type of wax ester that has a natural affinity for metal, on the molecular level. It literally binds itself to the surface of metal inside your engine, forming a boundary layer of lubrication that does not run off. However, the layer of molecules is so thin, that it will not interfere with any kind of engine mechanism...even the most finicky of oil-pressure-driven variable valve timing systems...unlike most other additives which hold solid particles in suspension (like PTFE, etc.). Many manufacturer-provided esoteric synthetic engine oils (like Nissan, for their GTR), use this exact same technology to provide cold-start (and high-heat/hard use) lubrication to the turbos and intricate valvetrains of the twin turbo V6 in the newest-generation GTR. But that oil is over $13 PER QUART.  The Lubeguard additive provides a real scientific, tangible benefit to your engine: this self-bonding synthetic liquid wax ester fluid.  So, what does this mean? It means your roller rockers and everything in your valvetrain remain lubricated no matter how cold it is and no matter how long the car has sat un-used (I have a 2011 outback that gets used once per week and this, alone, is an enormous benefit). It means the inherent Extreme Pressure qualities that the wax ester film has is going to reduce cylinder wall scuffing, cam lobe wear, etc.  The biggest benefit I've seen is during cold starts...the engine doesn't rev as high, drops to std idle speed much sooner, the engine is far quieter, and there is no valve noise. Seeing that around 90% of engine wear occurs within 60 seconds of startup over the lifetime of an engine (i.e. before the oil has had a chance to be pumped around the engine), this product offers an enormous, tangible benefit.  Other wear reduction benefits aside (and reduced wear ALL the time is indeed a true benefit), the cold start benefits are just huge. And I noticed a significantly better startup on an 85 degree Florida day in my 3.6 H6 engine that already has a Fram Ultra filter and Pennzoil Platinum....it already ran like a sewing machine. I cannot imagine the improvement in temps below 50 degrees F.  With Amazon's permission, a primer on LXE synthetic wax ester technology, its benefits, and its origins from the Lubeguard website (all lubeguard products are available HERE on Amazon for less than virtually anywhere else):  [...]	1
Love this stuff	1
I use this after every oil change it works great!!	1
This is great product and I recommend that people use it.	1
high quality	1
I'm not one who really uses additives as most oils contain a host of additives.  My 2010 Toyota Highlander uses conventional oil and has 161,000 miles on it.  I wanted to see if a product would actually provide a benefit over the oil and decided to give Lubegard a try.  Within the first 100 miles of use I noticed that the engine seemed to smooth out and appeared to gain power.  My gas mileage increased slightly (1-2 miles per gallon, according to the computer monitor) as well.  I now have 1800 miles and no problems have surfaced.  As this is the first oil additive that I have used in the vehicle I can say that I have been happy with the results.  Now, as with any product, results will vary due to a host of factors and my results should not indicate that you would obtain the same.  Would I recommend this product to a friend, yes.  Would I use this product again in my vehicle, yes.	1
After changing the oil in a car over twenty years old with 80K miles, the car developed a lifter tick.  It ticked all the time.  Having excellent luck with lubegard products before, I decided to try the engine oil additive.  After twenty or so miles the constant ticking stopped.  No other changes were felt or noted and no increase in fuel mileage was observed.	1
A friend told me to use this. Hesitant of "snake oils" I was not convinced. I dumped the whole bottle in my 14 year old Mercruiser 4.3 liter engine and it literally shaved 15 degrees off the operating temperature! I couldn't believe my eyes. This stuff is magic. I've used all sorts of other additives and NOTHING has done that before. I couldn't believe it.	1
Lubegard products are among the best!	1
Great stuff, cleans those old carbs.	1
Just like everyone else says, this stuff works!	1
Use it on everything I own.	1
My car still works!	1
Love this stuff.  Use it in my cars every 5k miles.  Got an extra 1 mpg.	1
works great	1
It really does lower engine temp slightly. Lubegard products are amazing; everyone should tell a friend to use the lubegard red at the least.	1
good product	1
Definitely improved mpg and engine smoothness/startup.  Just use with a good oil.  No need for synthetic.	1
Lubegard makes awesome products. Bio tech slowed my oil consumption a great deal.	1
Greatest Oil Additive for Engines,add to Synthetic Engine Oils !Every Oil Change!	1
Great for engine protection on Florida heat. Use with Mobil 1 oil.	1
Great deal cheaper than the parts store	1
fast shipping, works perfect, much appreciated	1
very tough	1
What is there to say - it works like advertised and makes running fuel lines super easy and very affordable. No complaints here. OEM quality for sure. No leaks on my entire system first time.	1
Not magic, but helpful. My engine seemed to run noticeably smoother after adding SeaFoam	1
Chainsaw hadn't been started for several years and was left with gasoline in it. It would not start  drained old gas and put a half can of sea foam in it cranked it over several times  let it set couple days  drained the sea foam put in new gas and after a couple pulls it started  this stuff works	1
Bought it to use in 2 cycle engines, don't know how much it helps but it makes me feel better doing something. Cheaper than anyplace around here	1
Great deal. This stuff is the best!	1
Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.	1
My inspection station said it was ruined after 1 year. Check yours before you drive in for state inspections.	1
Wiper was easy to install and works well. Traditionally designed it performs its function as intended.	1
Works great, far better than cheaper versions.	1
Longest lasting whipper I have ever owned	1
just ok	1
Terrific product. I've been using it for years in different cars. I think this product is probably the safest additive you could add to motor oil. Basically, it contains biodegradable, organic friction modifiers that aren't typically found in motor oil. There is no danger of clogged oil passages/filter elements or unwanted changes in viscosity, like some other products. My present Audi is notoriously hard of motor oil. I feel very safe in pushing my oil change interval to 6k+ miles with 10oz of Biotech & full synthetic motor oil.	1
awesome company and i love their addictives !!	1
I am happy with this product, I have used other Lubegard products and they all work well.	1
thx	1
A small engine mechanic turned me on to this stuff.  Helps with the start of small equipment. Good for diesels, or any engine. It seems to act as a cleaner. I wish I had an equivalent for my heart and vascular system. That's how I perceive ti to work on engines. Cleans the carb and other channels and mechanisms. Put a couple of spoonfuls in your small equipment when putting it away for the winter.	1
I use this to keep the fuel in the tank in great shape. Love how it keeps a carbuerator clean and improves performance even after sitting for several months in the off season. I use it in outdoor equipment, my pontoon, car, truck, Harley motorcycle and it does great!	1
I recently bought an old Ninja 250 with flooring issues.  I went overkill on the SeaFoam because I didn't want to have to buy a second bottle, so I waited for the gas tank to be almost empty and put about between a third and half a can into the tank.  Running the bike dead and waiting 10 minutes, then filling up the tank and taking it 4 miles home, I waited overnight to see the results.  Results are in! No more flooding and thank goodness I didn't have to learn to disassemble a carb. Someday, but not today!  The jets aren't stuck open, so the choke will warm.the engine up, but the throttle seems to still be flooding. No problem as you can just give it throttle for about 20 seconds (on and off) and it will clear out.  Very grateful this stuff exists.	1
seems ok, haven't ran motor enough to know,	1
great wipers	1
works as it should	1
Great deal	1
As advertised	1
Wiper works well for rain.  Only issue that I noticed is that when driving in slush, the wiper seems to get packed with slush.	1
Nice wiper, works good	1
I have used this product with each oil change in my Cadillac Northstar, which is notorious for oil usage. Right away the engine quieted down and it no loger goes through a quart of oil a month as it did before.  I will continue with LUBEGARD as long as I own the car. It works...buy it.	1
I did not use the Lubegard  Engine Oil Protectant as someone said the oil I used would not need any additive.	1
very good	1
Works as it says. Engine runs cooler by 10%.	1
This stuff is works as stated. My car is ten years old and the engine temp is easily 10% cooler than normal with this stuff in it.	1
Poor additive, made my engine heat goes high.	-1
Easy to use. Not sure I've seen a improvement on gas mileage, but my car revves up faster.	1
Seems like it worked great so far.	1
ok	1
Still haven't added this to my intake. Apparently my Beetle was having other issues. I put too much oil in and I feel the oxygen sensors might be fouled. I'm getting a code for "catalyst below efficiency." Hopefully I didn't destroy my catalytic converter. Maybe I'll take a look at that today and Sea Foam the puppy!	1
Love it , no better deals on the net	1
Engine runs better and improved milleage.	1
This is a faith based product!	1
Amazing. Every engine I have put this into runs quieter and cooler.  Mileage also improved on everything except my RV. :)	1
So far so good	1
I bought this to see if it would stop the infamous lifter noise in my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 (They are famous for this from what I see on the internet even though its usually not fatal). It has had the noise for 50,000 miles and runs fine but the noise on startup gets annoying. I am noticing that the noise has decreased quite a bit after about 100 miles and am hoping it totally goes away. I will update this review if that happens but either way I am happy. I have tried many other products and this is the first one to give results.  Bumping this up to a 5 after things seem to be getting noticeably better a few months later in the dead cold of winter when it used to be the most noticeable.	1
best on the market	1
fit great	1
It has been raining off and on and they definitely work	1
Received product in a timely manner.  Quality of product was good.  Product performed well in the purpose that it was ordered for. Thanks	1
Good stuff, great price. =)  What more can I say?	1
Useful gasoline additive, I have used it for several years in items that are to be stored for a few months.	1
Great product	1
good value	1
I used this product on a 2002 Chevy Venture with 137,000 miles on it, as I had a slight lifter tick. And now it's simply gone!.  No more dry starts, both in winter & summer. "Engine noise has decreased substantially".  Very happy with this product.	1
I added this to my last oil change. I didn't notice much of a difference. It seems like a product that might pay off in the long run.	1
I changed my engine oil at 144,000 miles and added this at the recommended ratio.  After 6000 miles, it seems that my gas mileage went up a little, but the biggest benefit was that it quieted down some ticking noises from the engine.	1
Can't really know if this oil additive is any better than the myriads of others but seems to be praised subjectively on my Subaru SVX Forum site.  BITOG as usual says oil additives are useless..just use good oil.	1
Other Lubegard products are known around circles like the transmission rebuilders (Lubegard Red) for the fact that they work. So many fluid addictives either do nothing or make the existing fluid worse; point being that additives have a bad reputation. Lubegard is the exception as I've seen with Lubegard Red when I've used it.  Honestly without an oil analysis it's hard to tell what's happening within the engine. Having said that, I've added a bottle with 0W-20 synthetic oil and it helped quiet the ticking on heavier acceleration on a new car. Oil looked amber colored after 10,000 miles and I've added another bottle when the oil was changed with a different brand of oil. So far the oil looks amber colored after 1,500 miles and the ticking noise is still non-existent. Unfortunately I'm under a maintenance plan so I'm stuck with a certain oil but I'm confident Lubegard will protect and I might get an oil analysis later.  Upside: peace of mind, decent price, company history, car seems to run better  Downside: only downside I see is if someone else changes the oil they might fill to the line or overfill making it so you have to remove some fluid before adding Lubegard. Get a fluid evacuator (great gadget) to remove some fluid then you can add this. As long as you aren't changing your oil every month this shouldn't be too big of a deal.	1
This product made a big difference in both my car and my daughters car.  Both of us noticed a better acceleration and smoothness of the engine.	1
After a great amount of research I found that this is one of the better engine additives out there.  Lots of additives to add to an existing quality oil's additive package and to help an engine to extend an oil change.  BTW, if you are wondering how long a specific oil can last in an engine before it starts breaking down I would highly recommend you search and find a place that does a Used Oil Analysis. This should help extend my Oil Change Interval significantly.	1
use it use it use it.......  It really does work, everything from weed trimmers, lifters in cars... RIDING LAWN MOWERS (and push ones but be careful between 2 stroke and 4 stroke) LOVE THIS STUFF WITH AN OIL CHANGE AS WELL. this stuff is usually 10 12 bucks in a napa  or tractor supply... just get a couple cans and have it.. it really does come in handy.	1
Great product and seller	1
IT definitely helped my bike run better	1
Just as described. Excellent price.	1
This stuff is amazing.  I run a bottle of it in every tank in my boat. Great for de-carbing 2 stroke motors.	1
good price	1
Works great.	1
This stuff is awesome. Fuel gauge on my 2005 Ford Explorer was malfunctioning. Manufacturer suggested it was from sulfur build-up inside the tank from cheap fuel. Followed the directions and if fixed the problem. I now use it in all my gas-powered tools (chain saws, wood splitter, lawn mower, hedge trimmer) and dirt bikes when they've sat a while and might have some residue build-up in the carburetors. Love it.	1
Seafoam is great for small engines with today's junk gas.	1
This is some pretty good stuff to clean out your motor. I've used it for years. I just bought a Harley that had only 5k miles on it, fuel injected and it ran rough from not being run. Some fuel injector cleaner and 4 onces of SeaFoam and 40 miles later it's running like new. It's only 1 of 2 additives I use that's worth anything and amazon has a good price on it. The "on sale" price at auto discount is $12.50	1
Seafoam is awesome.  I use it pretty much everywhere.  In the crank case before an oil change to clean up sludge and carbon deposits.  It works great.  Although, it's best to start these treatments on an engine when it's new and continue to do so at each oil change.  You can see the how well it's working by how black your oil gets.  I usually run my engine gently with a bottle of Seafoam for 100 miles before each oil change.  By the end of the 100 miles the oil is pitch black.  I also use it in the gas tank to clean up the fuel system.  I usually add 2 bottles of Seafoam to a full tank every 5K miles or so.  And I also use the Seafoam spray in my intake every 5-10K miles as well.  It requires an assistant, so I usually end up having to wait until I can get someone to help.  Seafoam has worked wonders for me in the past.  It freed up a stuck valve in my F150 after about only 10 minutes of a bottle in my crank case.  I've seen it clean large carbon deposits out of the combustion chamber when sprayed through the intake.  It really is my go to source for all performance related cleaning.	1
Grabbed for $7. I like to do the full Seafoam once a year- air intake, fuel, oil.	1
I have been using Seafoam in All of my vehicles and equipment for over 40 years .  I met the man who originally formulated Seafoam , he was from the Minneapols area ...He brewed this stuff in his garage !! ,  and traveled around Minnesota and Wisconsin , selling it by the can or by the case , out of the back of his station wagon , mostly to marinas and small engine shops .   The mechanics liked the stuff so much , he decided to branch out and get into the Automottive market .   I was a young kid , 23 / 24 years old , working in a parts store when he stopped in for the first time . He noticed my old Harley parked out front and gave me a can for free , saying if it didn't run better after using it , he would give me 10 bucks the next time he stopped in . Happily , I agreed to try it .....honestly expecting to make 10 bucks .   Well , that old Harley was like it came to life ! It had never run so good !   I didn't want the 10 bucks , I wanted more Seafoam , for my truck , & lawnmower . I bought 6 cans for myself , and a case to put on the shelf in the parts store ....I was excited ...I told everybody that came in with a fuel related problem to try it , and if they weren't satisfied I would refund their money ( $1.99 at the time:-)   No one ever asked for a refund ..... I kept asking him what was in the stuff & he would just grin ....finally , after knowing him for quite some time , he told me the original formula contained something called "stoddard solvent" and a very light lubricating oil .   Anyway , the years went by , I sold hundreds and hundreds of cans of Seafoam over the years . And used it religiously in every motor I had .   He got hooked up directly with NAPA , Carquest & all the big parts distributors , so he didn't come around himself anymore , and eventually , I heard that he sold his business to a corporation and retired .   I'm ashamed to say , I don't remember his name . It was so long ago. But what a guy he was !   Oh , .....I had that same old Harley for 28 years , Always ran Seafoam in it , Especially after they did away with leaded fuel , because the lead in the fuel acted as a lubricant .   I took the motor apart one time  to rebuild it ....The valves and inside of the cylinder heads were so clean they looked like new !   I still , to this day .... I'm 68 yrs old now , use Seafoam in every motor I own !	1
Excellent	1
have had a rash of fuel issues this year with the 3 dirtbikes and 2 atvs in my care.  really crappy gas causing all kinds of fouling.  read a couple of reviews and thought I'd try this out.  it does a really good job of cleaning varnish and crud out of the lines.  i didn't get the smoke effect that was described in numerous reviews, but i just added this as per the instructions at 1 oz per gal of fuel in the tank.  there is a noticeable difference in the way all the bikes run.  i have since changed gas station loyalties and am hoping that this, along with an occasional sip of sea foam, will keep these bikes running good all year...making the carb rebuild/cleaning an annual task rather than monthly?  i suspect that the dirtier the system, the more noticeable the effect will be and i don't think that this is a miracle product, but it does a good job of cleaning with less work.	1
Purchased a 2008 mini Cooper in 2015. Have had those quirky things that BMWs have. Like misfires. Dropped some oil onto outer casing, then rumbling at lights, sticking between gears. Put entire can in gas tank when it was 1/2 full. Let gas go almost completely dry then filled up. Wow! This stuff really works. Smooth gear shifting, increased horsepower and not one inkling of misfire. Will use in every car, every 6 months. Couldn't hurt to use an oil additive as well on full synthetic cars. Mist of the cheap High octane gas I purchase does less than nothing for the life of the car. Best to use Mobil 1 gas and oil as it includes the necessary components for a healthy engine and use a product like this.  Advice: use funnel when puring into gas tank. Liquid is clear tends to spill onto car, cap/ top not long enough.	1
For the people who give this stuff reviews such as "it give me more power" or something to that nature, they may be drinking it instead of using it in their car. It cleans up a carb good. If your car is a worn out heap, save your money. You're still going have a worn out heap and be 8 bucks short. If you got engine that's a little gummed up, try it out. It will prob clean it up nice. I've used it on lawn equipment that's been sitting with good results. Cleans it up nice. But be realistic, it's not a mechanic in a bottle.	1
Best stuff on earth don't use anything else	1
We recently purchased a 2013 Ford Focus. It only had 13,200 miles on in, but it seemed to be choppy when it idled. I had heard that the Sea Foam Motor Treatment worked well to clean out the carburetor. I purchased a can and followed the instructions on the bottle. I also checked out YouTube and their were a couple of good videos. My Focus idles smooth. Very pleased that I saved a trip to my mechanic and several $$ with this. We purchased another can and ran it through our 1998 Ford Explorer. It seemed to improve the gas mileage by 3mpg. on the Explorer. We had not had the Focus long enough to know if the mileage was improved or not. Great stuff!!!	1
It made a difference the way the car runs.	1
Cleans out the dirtiest carbs and fuel lines. Amazing stuff	1
I have inspected the piston/cylinder before and after using this product, sucked up through a vacuum line into the intake. The difference is noticeable, but not night and day. Vehicles always seem to run a bit better right after, but that could just be my imagination. It sure is fun to use though!	1
Great product. We have been using it for probably around 20 years & it still is awesome!	1
I have always has great success with seafoam,but I'm sure that sometimes there is so much carbon that it would make matters worse. I have used alot of Lucas,but my dodge ram didn't like it,owell.so now I only use seafoam ,works great for my 2000 town car and my 2014 navigator.  I	1
ok	1
Been using for a couple years, I think it helps since most carbs are now junk(throw away) thank you EPA, Oh yeah thanks for the NEW gas can spouts too.	1
great Item	1
great product	1
As always Sea Foam always satisfies!	1
Works very well, and nice alternative to the heavy solvent based cleaners.	1
Good product.  Put it in my gas tank because my gauge was sticking and after just one full tank the needle was moving up to full without a problem.	1
Worked great	1
Total waste of money. I used it in the fuel tank and added it to the intake. Got a lot of smoke but no improvement.	-1
Perfect to eliminate the problem.	1
cleans up my lawnmower engine. now i can mow until the cows come home!	1
Does a great job.  I like to add it to my tank of gas periodically before a long ride.	1
great helps clean injectors.	1
nice product	1
It really does seem to work.  I had two valves that were sticking at times.  Compression was almost non-existent on those cylinders when the valves were stuck.  Used the Sea Foam.  The fix was good and very quick. I don't know what freed the valves: Putting it in the intake or putting it in the oil.  The compression came back on both cylinders.  I plan on giving it another treatment just for insurance.	1
I've used this product for years and I do believe it's kept my fuel systems clean.  Thousands of miles in four different vehicles and never a fuel related problem with any of them.  I recommend this highly and use a can in my vehicles at every oil change.	1
Use in all my vehicles. Generally put a can in after every oil change.	1
This stuff works like magic. I have even used it in my Ferrari Dino to free up sticky valves.	1
thanks	1
NEEED A KICK IN YOUR CAR, THIS IS GOOD STUFF	1
GREAT AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT.  NEVER REALIZED I COULD BUY THIS FROM AMAZON.  I WAS PAYING WAY TOO MUCH.  THIS IS A SUPER PRODUCT BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS.	1
my dad has always used sea foam soooooo	1
I think this is the best product on the market for conditioning older engines	1
as described but bad packaging.  Product was very dented	1
This stuff is miracle in a bottle.  Amazon has the best price by a few dollars so you will save in that aspect.  I use this religiously in small engines.  Every time i add gas to my lawnmower/weedwacker/leafblower I put in some of this stuff and have seen a noticeable difference in my engines performance.  You may see a little bit of white smoke coming from your exhaust when you use this, this is normal.  I used to have to clean the carburetors on my engines at least once a season, but now I have not had to do it in two seasons since using this product.  Buy it, try it out and see for yourself.	1
Used on my 2014 GMC Sierra 1500. Manual recomend DOT 3 but I decided to used this higher qualith DOT4. Actually according to the label it exceed DOT 4 standards. Since I do the maintenance of my truck i like to buy god quality fluids and this is one of them.	1
the right stuff	1
Just so everybody knows all DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluid is synthetic. Manufactures use that as a buzz word. Dot 5 brake fluid is silicone base and can't be mixed with DOT3 or DOT4	1
more than double what you need to flush the brakes on S1000RR	1
tshjioujkjikuppl;]p	1
Well, my brakes still work.  So that's a good sign that the quality is there.	1
Ever since I discovered Sea Foam I have not looked back. From fuel injector cleaner, to engine oil sludge, to throttle body, and intake manifolds. This does it all. Just read the bottle or look on their website for instructions and the possibilities.	1
Works well	1
I have use after oil change in cars and mowers, mower 20 years old, still running. Both cars over 150K miles.	1
this stuff really works.  no more backfires.	1
As always, the best	1
Best fluid for a DOT 3 system to upgrade it to DOT4.	1
I completely flushed the DOT3 out of my 2010 Traverse, and replaced with this.  Now, at every other oil change I suck out what his in the reservoir and replace.  The breaks never give us any issues, works great.	1
Hard to find this stuff in my area. Have relied on it for years without a problem.	1
As expected.	1
Does a good job. Make sure you use it in dry places as all brake fluid is hygroscopic.	1
great	1
Love this stuff! Great way to clean intakes, carbs, and injectors.	1
Great to clean our carbon, I put in gas + TB, never in crankcase for me.	1
Great product, evened out the idle in my truck and gave back some lost power on heavy acceleration.	1
Great Product. Use it in all my engines and get noticeably improved performance on older engines.	1
Miracle in a bottle.  Hand a mower that wouldnt start.  put a little in, waited and WAM works like a champ!  I would certainly recommend this product to others.	1
Great stuff.  I've always recommended this product to family and friends.  You can actually see this stuff go to work and tell by the outcome.  Don't hesitate, just grab a can and use it.  You'll want to get more for future use as well.	1
Recommended by a mechanic friend of mine after I tried other products that didn't help at all. 2011 Ford F-150 XLT with the twin turbo 3.5 L EcoBoost engine with 52,780 miles on it.  I put 2 bottles in a full tank of gas.  After 100 miles, I could feel the difference in power.  My fuel economy on the highway increased by 2 Mpg.  The truck felt new again.  I'll never use anything else for cleaning my fuel system, injectors, valves etc! Update 12-3-16. I have a Husquvarna backpack blower.  It blows at like 320 Mph wide open.  It blows leaves, sticks, rocks, dogs and any small children in its path.  We have over two acres, of which about 1/3 is grass and the rest is woods.  The woods surround our yard.  Anyway, I grabbed the blower Monday to start clearing the leaves.  It barely ran, and wouldn't run over half throttle at all.  I hadn't used it since May, so I figured bad gas or gunked up carb.  I didn't want to tear the carb apart and clean it, so I ordered more Sea Foam.  I added a couple of ounces to the gas tank and fired it up.  Within a couple of minutes, the rpm's started increasing.  Within 5 minutes, it was once again running full throttle, blowing yard debris everywhere.  If not for this product, I'd of either had to pull the bowl off the carb and clean the jets, or take it somewhere for repair.  Both require time and money.  Sea Foam saved me both, and the beast is now roaring again!	1
Excellent brake fluid!	1
good stuff!	1
This stuff is great, compatible with nearly everything, high boiling point and has very low moisture absorption, I have been using it in everything from motorcycles to 4wd's for almost 10 years and it always works well. I cant find it in big box auto stores anymore who seem to discontinue anything that works too well.	1
good stuff	1
Always use Castrol products.  Have never had a mechanical failure because of a product they make.	1
I have been using Castrol GTLMA for over 20 years in my cars and motorcycles. Excellent at reducing corrosion in the brake system. Since I started using it, I have never had a brake component fail due to corrosion or seal failure. Can I give it six stars?	1
Good product	1
This stuff works well. I have used it in several vehicles and it holds up nicely. I really don't know if it absorbs less moisture than other fluid but it's at least as good as the factory stuff.	1
Old standby for British classics.	1
It works well. I flushed my brake lines with it and everything works out fine. No issues.	1
Good solid stuff.  My only complaint is that because of this stuff being of a higher standard, it is also a lot more corrosive when it lands on painted surfaces.  Very safe, great to bleed the air out of, provides a solid pedal.  But if you spill some, wibe it up and since it off as soon as you can!	1
Excellent product for small motors. Lawn mowers, snow blowers etc... If it's hard to start this will fix it.	1
good stuff!	1
Ok	1
Wow works great	1
I was haivng some noisy lifters and clicking for the first 5 minutes of driving in a 2003 Tahoe with 5.3 engine. Put half the bottle in the oil and drove it for 100 miles and changed the oil. Have not heard the ticking since. Great stuff.	1
Like any other similar product it is not a " magic potion" it has it's limitations just like they all do.	1
Does a great job!	1
Quick shippment and product was just as advertised.	1
I flushed my Lotus with this to replace the ATE Type 200 because the ATE just absorbs water too fast. I don't know if it is me or it's the fluid...but I swear that this doesn't give me as good of a pedal feel as the ATE. It feels a little spongier and not as solid. But overall, for the price, I can't complain.	1
Love this brake fluid, I have used it in a cpl vehicles when doing a complete fluid flush using my motive power bleeder! I will be flushing the fluid in my wife's 2001 Tacoma and I'm sure this fluid will be great like it's always been! My only wish is that more auto stores carried it, I bought it at NAPA auto in the past and had to pay more for it. Great brake fluid and worth the $$$$$ spent!!!!	1
I use only 100% synthetic fluids for my 1990 Toyota Camry which I keep in mint condition since the day I bought it new in 1990. Mobil 1 Extended Performance motor oil. Royal Purple Max ATF Synthetic automatic transmission fluid, Royal Purple fully synthetic Power Steering fluid and Toyota 50/50 Anti-Freeze coolant.  I won't give a lesson on why synthetic fluids are far superior to conventional fluids. I've had that argument WAY before auto manufacturers started REQUIRING synthetic fluids right from the factory. They are far superior.  In the case of this brake fluid. I've compared all the spec. sheets on all the major brake fluids, and this one meets the highest standards. I just keep is simple with fluids and follow two rules. Change EVERY fluid on your vehicle yearly (more often n the case of the motor oil depending how much you drive) and use the BEST fluids available. THIS is the best brake fluid available.	1
Perfect, excellent service, fast delivery,highly recommended.!!!	1
Besides the obvious protection value, this product really seems to both soften and replenish the natural elasticity of the leather seats our in car. The smell of the product is good, and a little bit goes quite a way. The price is reasonable, and so I am positive I will stay with Zymol for my leather seats.	1
seems to polish and make the leather softer. So far so good. Got it real quick, I was surprised!	1
First off, let me point out that I am not associated with Zymol in any way shape or form, other than a consumer of their product.  I sought out a leather restorer/conditioner for my Lotus Evora.  The car has exquisite leather, however due to the design of the interior the leather is stretched incredibly tightly across the dash and door panels.  Over time, the intense heat of the California sun had caused the leather to bubble in some areas and warped the airbag panels.  I admit--it was my fault for not using a leather conditioner on it.  I had run out of Zymol Leather Creme and simply hadn't had time to buy more.  Anyway a fellow owner saw my dash and pointed me to Leatherique, which was highly acclaimed amongst high-end car owners. I tried this Leatherique product for 4 months, and it was not able to restore the leather to its original condition. That said, I don't believe there is a 'magic bullet'.  If Leatherique is touted to be the absolute best money can buy (it is quite expensive), and it was not able to restore my leather, nothing will.  Subsequently, I had my Dashboard replaced.  I went back to my old standard leather conditioner, and I can tell you having used both side by side, they are practically identical, other than the smell.  They both leave the leather surface nice and clean, and smooth.  No gloss whatsoever.  Also, I have to say the Zymol had my car smelling much closer to the original leather smell.  The Leatherique smelled alright, but I really like Zymol.  They are both gentle on the leather, but price-wise, Zymol is only a fraction of the cost of the Leatherique product.  Both are great, but if you want a product that will leave your leather smelling nice, get the Zymol product.  It's also cheaper.  (BTW, don't get the Zymol Leather Cleaner, it's too soapy.)  Best of luck to you!	1
This conditioner leaves the leather soft and smelling like new leather. I have tried other brands when I could not find Zymol but nothing came close.	1
Your expensive leather needs special care. Zymol Leather Conditioner is the leading authority on leather and this product has my highest recommendation!	1
Very good product fro small engines. I have 3 lawns mowers two weed whackers and a riding mower and all of them are doing fine. Even when I started using them  after a cold winter in Vermont they started as they had been used the day before. Angelo Caserta	1
Thank you seafoam.  Was having some P codes telling me that my car was running too lean after changing the oxygen sensor, and using this helped the Check Engine light go away.  Also used in the crank case and helped a lot as well too with some vibration in the car when it was running.  Only place i have not used this place is the throttle body.  I used 3M for that, and it works very well too.	1
It's sea foam it works. I picked up a POS ford Explorer with 200k on it for next to nothing because it was running bad. I use it around town so I don't have to mile up my new truck. I removed the air filter intake at the plenum and dumped in half a can. I started the beast and let it run, revving it up about every minute until the smoke from the sea foam cleared. I repeated it again with the rest of the can and when I was done the rig was running fantastic after the sea foam knocked the carbon out of the engine. I dumped another full can in the gas to get after any carbon that may be left. I also dumped half a can in the engine oil to help clean up any sludge that may have built up, I will use the other half of the can after the next oil change and ad it in with the oil. This product was one of my lines back in the day when I worked for an auto store as an outside rep, so I know all about it. It's also great for stabilizing fuel in containers small engines, and any fuel that will be sitting around for a long period of time. It will stabilize fuel for one year.	1
One of just a few additives I believe in.  Have used it for years.	1
This is great stuff!  I used this to do a flush on my Lexus GS400 and it works great.  Pros: Better braking performance Mixes with DOT3 and DOT4 Castrol Brand so you know its good.  Cons: None  Buy with confidence and enjoy!	1
What you will be getting is Castrol DOT 4 Synthetic oil which you can get at the local auto parts store for half this price.  Castrol GT LMA is the old name of the same product. When I called auto part stores for Castrol GT LMA they did not have it because it's the old name they are not familiar with.	1
I've used Castrol LMA brake fluid in various street and racing cars for decades and always have been happy with the results.  It's easy to bleed systems using LMA, and it's easy to get a firm pedal.  I haven't experienced any caliper or master cylinder corrosion, but I always change and fully flush my brake systems every 2-years of more often on the race cars.  Good reliable product that does what it's intended to do.	1
Great stopping power! My brakes feel softer and spongier, but the stopping power much higher than before. It's so great that moderate pressure made the wheels skid while stopping and getting off the highway. Castrol is a trusted brand. It is a product you can confide in. By the way it is Made in Germany! It has to be well made or the Germans would not bother.	1
Needed a large bottle of fressh LMA fluid for a complete rebuild of the hydraulics on my sports car restoration project.  Chose Castrol LMA because of infrequent use of the vehicle and long storage periods.  Wanted to preserve the hydraulic system with a Low Moisture fluid.	1
I've used this through the vacuum lines in a 2005 Jeep grand cherokee, 1999 Lexus ls400, 2008 Kia optima, 2001 silverado 5.3, 1994 chevy lumina, 2001 chevy blazer and lots of small engines. Works great on them but the biggest difference was on the silverado. Gained tons of throttle response and about 3-4 mpg. Was getting 12 mixed and after the sea foam it was getting a consistent 16 mixed and 19 mpg highway! And for what its worth DO NOT sea foam if you suspect an intake manifold leak! It blew out the gasket on the blazer.	1
This product works really well for me. I used it to help start my off season power tools (lawn mower in spring and snow blower in winter) that sit for months. Without Sea Foam, I have to struggle to get them started at the beginning of the season.  With Sea Foam mixed into the gas, its 10x easier to get them started and running. I also put it in the oil of my cars about a week before I have the oil changed. Highly recommend.	1
I add 1 ounce to a gallon of diesel fuel in my tractor to reduce smoking. Good product.	1
Neglected to put fuel treatment in one of my bikes last winter which made for some very rough running and a gummed up fuel system. One can of Sea Foam and a fresh tank of gas... Runs like new!!	1
Not sure if it has had any significant effect on my vehicles since I use detergents every once in a while but I think it does its job.	1
I have used this for years.  I had a stuck piston ring on my 1984 22R 4x4 and would foul a plug in 500 miles.  In time after using Sea Foam in the carb while running, and the tank, really using to see if I could unstick the piston ring, I got it to 2000 miles before the plug would foul, then 5000, and now no problem.  I use it on all my Roto-tillers, lawn mowers, 89 Jeep Wranger, 84 Toyota, I put it in wifes 2016 Toyota Venza periodically,  etc.  If you use directoy in the carb, you have to add just a little and keep the revs up to keep it running.	1
Castrol makes a geat brake fluid and it seems to be harder to find in the 32 oz size. Shipping was fast and there was no problems with the sale.	1
got this to flush the brake fluid from my cbr and rebel and has worked great.  it was just the right amount for 2 bikes so overall a great purchase.  so far haven't noticed any brake loss with the new fluid so i expect it to hold well over time.	1
After installing a set of new brake lines, I flushed and bled my lines using this Castrol fluid.  I had a track day coming up, so I wanted to make sure that my brakes were as free of air and had fresh fluid as possible.  This fluid works great!  Through repeated track runs with heavy braking, I saw very little fade in the pedal, and no loss of fluid or air in the lines.  It is a bit less expensive than some of the other brands that are geared towards track use, which is fine for those of us who are constantly bleeding their lines before each race.  The only "problem" is that flushing lines is a bit difficult as this fluid is a similar color to the OEM fluid.  As others have mentioned, I did do some more research and realized I promoted a poor practice of adding a few drops of water based dye to the fluid to differentiate between old and new fluid.  edit: Removed line "One remedy to this is to put a few drops of food coloring in the container and mix it up a bit so that the new fluid gets a bit darker." ... don't do this!	1
Unless you want to spend a fortune for the super-premium fluids, IMHO, this is the one to buy. Castrol has been my first choice for over 40 years and I've never regretted it.	1
Good stuff use it all the time	1
Even after a carb clean this stuff keeps the gum from building up on my Raptor 660 needles and jets.	1
Great price and good quality product.  I have a Ford Expedition that was at 95k miles.  Time to swap the spark plugs.... which tend to break into two pieces.  I looked on line and there was a person recommending running three tanks for fuel treatment, then also sucking this into the upper end of the engine through a vacuum hose.  I did this and when the plugs were replaced, I didn't have a single plug break off.  The mechanic thanked me for doing this because it made his life easier.	1
heck of a deal at this price.	1
Seems to a wonder product !! use for about any thing	1
I can't really tell the difference in performance but it's too early to say. I'll give it a benefit of doubts.	1
Use this before replacing Oxygen sensors or EGR valves suspect of malfunction.  Skeptical at first, I now advocate for SEA FOAM after saving a lot of time and money replacing sensors that are merely dirty.	1
This stuff seems to really work great	1
Works as expected.	1
This stuff works, I had an idle jet that was gummed up. Mixed 1-1. Ran bike, let sit, ran bike, let sit and all good.	1
Works very well! Followed the directions on the youtube videos created by the makers of SeaFoam and my lawnmower is running more smoothly without having to disassemble the carbs! Fantastic!	1
I have gotten myself into DIY car jobs within the last few years and everybody who has been doing it longer than I have has always recommended Seafoam to me. My gas mileage increased more than five mpg the first time I poured a can into my car and I have been a firm believer ever since.  It's also good for cleaning catalytic converters. I recommend looking up this procedure on the internet before attempting but if done correctly, you may not need to pay for that brand new catalytic converter that your local repair shop is saying you need.	1
no issues	1
Old reliable for treating my car. It's easy to use and it works. Won't use anything else when Sea Foam is available.	1
seems to fix a lot of fuel related problems in small engines as well as car engines.	1
great product always have some on hand	1
I used this in the fuel for an older 4 stroke outboard for my tin boat.  Within 10 minutes on the water, i could feel the engine smooth out.  I was also able to idle without stalling out after seafoam.	1
Best product to clean your engine	1
Excellent	1
Helps keep the engine clean and reduce rough idle. I add it to my car about twice a year. My current car is a 2005 IS300 with 180k miles.	1
love this stuff	1
Great Item	1
210,000miles on 2006 Honda CR-V. I split into 3rds. Put in gas tank, crankcase, brake vacuum (while running) (very easy)it smoked like crazy afterwards, I ran it hard while it smoked, drove on highway for 50 miles. When I finally stopped at a red light, I was amazed at how quiet and smooth the idle was. It's so quiet now! I can't feel the motor!1 time user as of today.	1
It's sea foam	1
Bought this as a fuel treatment and as a cleaner via my vacuum lines in my 2006 Mazda RX8. It has worked great! Just follow the directions on the can. For the vacuum line cleaning I looked up a video very quickly online that told me which lines were the proper vacuum lines. The 2006 RX8 has multiple lines that need to be treated in order to clean the whole rotary engine.  This canister is 16fl oz of sea foam  Pros: *Works great *O2 safe *Easy to use  Cons: *None  Additional Considerations: Be careful when finding which lines to put this liquid into. Make sure you trust the source of information. Make sure you let it set long enough to let it work as well.  Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars  If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.	1
couldn't find at local Walmart....so bought on here	1
I swear by this stuff, try to use about a can a month.	1
Nice	1
Inconclusive.  Didn't notice a difference, but not sure there was a problem beforehand.  And my Jeep didn't explode, so I might buy more.	1
Great price and product.	1
just works well.	1
This product was highly recommended. It made a noticeable difference after using it.	1
Thanks	1

F-150 with 100k on it was misfiring under heavy load at high speeds. Changed the plugs, injectors, and fuel filter. Put a can of sea foam in a 3/4 full tank. Got on the freeway and immediately started misfiring like craz and bogging down. Grateful I got home alive. Just wish I could get it back out of my tank now.	-1
I purchased a new hood insulation pad along with new retaining clips and the 3M Super yellow Trim Adhesive for a Mercedes SL600. I followed all installation instructions. 10 days later the pad is completely delaminated from the middle of the hood. It remains attached only around the perimeter. It appears to only be attached where there is a double layer of sheet metal. Perhaps the 3M Super adhesive, was unable to withstand the heat from the sun baked hood (temp only in the 80s). Very disappointed in the product. For $26+ I expected more. I may not be able to salvage the pad since it is currently attached along the edges (drooping through the middle). I have not tried to remove it yet, it may not come off in one piece. This may be a $100 lesson. Don't know what to try next.	-1
Not as good as the  Weatherstrip Trim Adhesive I used to use. The "Super" doesn't work as well.	-1
Used this in a 2011 Jeep Wrangler with 53000 on the clock - measured exactly as stated and put it in the oil as well as a full tank of gas  I then changed the oil after about 100+ miles  Never noticed any thick smoke and never noticed ANY difference whatsoever in the Jepp - nothing  Maybe something happened in the background and it just was not noticeable - but have no idea if this made any difference to anything in the Jeep	-1
did not seem to hold well for my use	-1
Purchased two of these to ensure bonding for Mercedes Hood Insulation Pad.  Found only needed one.  The item description does not mention that the unused can cannot be returned due to shipping restrictions.  This should have been indicated in the product text somewhere.  Product worked great but shipping policy is a failure.	-1
Manufacturers suggests using high quality gasoline instead of using market fuel system cleaner. The only market product they recommend is the BG products. And yes BG products are the best. You can do you own research and find a lot of information. There is bunch of videos on youtube about BG products.	-1
Dont buy this filter for a 1995 f350 7.3 diesel because it won't fit even tho it says it will .Best bet is to go to local parts store where they know what to sell you	-1
Didn't feel any difference in power or smoothness in the engine running	-1
I didn't really notice any difference in performance after using this product.	-1
It did not work well in my 2008 Gm car... Changed with a different product that starts with a V and ends with  a E......... I used it for a flush Always get 2 times what you think you need for a flush....	-1
put it in my gas tank when there was maybe 4 gallons left. Then ran it until it hit empty and filled it up.  Didn't really do anything noticeable. Might grab another bottle to run through my oil system.	-1
Look very much like the OEM ones I took off of my Honda, easy to put on! I got them on in about 5 minutes and it was getting dark out side! Trico does not make bold claims, they just make a decent wiper and the one thing I really like is it comes just with the adapter for your car's mount instead of a mess of adapters for a lot of different vehicles. For this reason alone, I will keep buying these. Also, easy to get into the package and nicely packed.update January 2013, do not buy these, I hd to replace them in less than 3 months, the mechanism that holds them to the main wiper is flimsy and driver side one broke this morning.	-1
used this last summer in my gas lawn mower...this spring when I tried to start my mower it was all gummed up...had to have it serviced and parts replaced...wouldn't recommend for this purpose	-1
Not a good product at all.  My 1 year old wipers worked better.  These leave marks and don't wipe away the water.	-1
Good product but can be purchased for almost $4 less at Walmart.	-1
Snake oil !!!!!!!!!  this junk reminds me of the old time veterinarians putting "crystals" on a horse hoof that was bad.  After lighting the crystals with a match the smoke would billow for about a minute making the owner think that this was some great stuff.  This junk just produces smoke and my truck still runs crappy.  I got my money back.  PS: don't use STP either this crap just settles in the oil pan like mat of gooey oil.	-1
What can you say about something that simply didn't work as advertised.  I followed the directions to the letter and found it useless.	-1
I ended up receiving a faulty fuel pump that was no good.costed me $1,700 to have it replaced the second time.i would not chance it.just don't buy it.	-1
If you're trying to decarbonize your engine, try water injection or other proven methods...because this stuff does not do what it claims on the can...Just because white smoke pours out your exhaust DOES NOT mean it is getting cleaned. I've purchased my last can of this stuff...Will do water injection in the future!!	-1
could not see any change	-1
I read a lot of awesome reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. I didn't "Seafoam the car" but just added this to the gas tank. I'm not sure what happened but the car struggled to move and made a lot of noise. I tried the Gumout 800001365 Regane High Mileage Fuel System Cleaner and the car drives very well, the performance has improved. Basing my opinion solely on the performance difference I've observed, I would consider this product a total waste of money.	-1
I have used both cans of this product on different cars. The product results in a tremendous amount of emissions being spewed into the air when sucked into the vacuum system as described in the articles I read about the product before purchasing it. In addition to creating air pollution and drawing angry stares from neighbors, I am simply not convinced the product is effective.	-1
Didn't fit like it said it would fit. was to small.	-1
I've never been sold on sea foam... a lot of people swear by it but I've never seen any results for better or worse after having used a dozen or so bottles on 5 different vehicles ranging from 30k miles to 270k miles used both via the gas tank and air intake.	-1
I used the product as indicated on the instructions for two full tanks of gas in my SUV. Perhaps this will help if your car has been sitting around for a year or two, but I didn't notice much difference after using it and can't vouch for any other benefits. Tried a competing product also and haven't noticed any results with it either. I'm tempted to give it one star, but I'm going to reserve that until I try it in my snow blower to see if it works with simple 2 stage engines that lay around unused for a year.	-1
I ordered this as it said it would fit my car and it didn't as one end leaked like crazy.  This was a big disappointment and there is not way I can return it as it smells like gas because I installed it and started the car and it leaked.  Checked with Ford and they said I needed another filter.	-1
There is no filter for this truck waste of money	-1
The filter does not fit, it is too long.	-1
Dries too fast. Difficult to sand smooth. Somewhat porous so that even a prime coat causes the top coat to have a slightly different appearance.	-1
Does not work. Installed as riected for a small leak in a radiator. Leak stopped for about a day then came right back	-1
Over priced	-1
Came missing the required clips to install. The original clips always break. Also had no caps on each end, allowing dirt into filter.	-1
Any amount in a hole over a 3/16" wide will not dry correctly and crack. It says pinhole on the package and that would be about the only size of the hole it would work on.	-1
I used 1/3 on crankcase and 16 oz on gas tank. Changed engine oil and filter after 200 miles. Btw my minivan used to average 320 miles full tank. 1st fillup 260 miles, averaging 19 mpg. 2nd fill up with new engine oil and filter 238 miles, averaging 17 mpg. 10% city and 90% freeway driving. Google search sea foam decreasing mpg.  2003 toyota sienna 88k miles	-1
I don't even need it.	-1
Product didn't remove water from the fuel as discribed all it did was settel it out and create foam in the fuel. Shipping was slow I wouldnt use this again	-1
Tube says it hardens in 20-25 minutes. forget it! it takes 24 hours. It could take you forever to do a job with this. Also cracks while drying.	-1
The 1-star is to let everyone know that this fits Ford F-150 trucks with a manufacturer date BEFORE 12-05-2005. It's the 5/16" version.  If your truck was manufactured AFTER 12-05-2005 you will most likely need the 3/8" version (Motorcraft FG1083). I had to return this and now I have to wait to do my filter change.  Amazon should really fix this listing.	-1
wrong filter for my truck, and wrong information.	-1
I used this product on an Ikea pigmented/finshed leather couch and it did not condition it at all.  The couch started to crack and peel after a few months of use after applying this product.  There were no signs of cracking or peeling before.  I think, this product may have hastened it by actually drying the leather.  I'd stick to a real leather conditioner than this all-in-one cleaner/conditoner.  Why still the two stars?  To be fair, I never used it for car leather upholstery, for which it is targetted for.	-1
don't buy this	-1
I put my vehicle in the pull down list and when it arrived it didn't fit. Kinda disappointing. Didn't know what that was about.	-1
I have been using the Armor All Leather Conditioner cream for a bunch of years and I love the way it goes on and it has a great smell.  I ordered this thinking it was the same stuff, but boy was I wrong.  This gel sits on top of the leather (I have 2 different cars with 2 kinds of leather seats to test with and it is the same in both) and doesn't appear to soak in.  The cream conditioner I can work in with my hands, but this stuff is like smearing ketchup all over your seats (and it comes in a ketchup bottle by the way).  There is a residue left behind though because the horrible smell is everywhere.  I can't even wash it off my hands after trying with 3 kinds of soap.  It smells like a cross between French perfume and hospital sanitizer.  Makes me gag a little bit.  I was hopeful it wouldn't be as strong once on the seats, and maybe by tomorrow it will have dissipated a bit.  Bottom line: This stuff is going back or in the garbage.	-1
I purchased the Motorcraft FA1632 air filter for my 1998 F150 V8 5.4 liter.  It will not seat all the way into the housing thus I am unable to completely close the cover.  When comparing this filter to the FRAM filter that I "attempted to replace" the cone on the Motorcraft is a bit taller (maybe 1/2") which and I think this is the reason I'm had difficulty closing the cover.  In addition, when comparing the two filters, the FRAM appears to be much better constructed than the Motorcraft.  I am not a fan of FRAM filters, as I have read their oil filters are junk.  However, based on this experience, I'm going with FRAM air filters from now on and going to stay away from Motorcraft products entirely whenever possible.	-1
did not fit as stated.  need to return. completely wrong size	-1
I have nothing against Stoner and I like trying new products for our cars. I was hoping that this would, as advertised, give a nice, glossy shine to my dashboard and other plastic or vinyl inside the car. It really did not. I think it may have imparted a slight gloss,but not the type of shine you'd get with a liquid product and certainly not detail worthy. Luckily it was inexpensive.	-1
As a relatively new cloth convertible top owner I wanted to pro-actively to take good care of my top from the start.  All roads lead to RaggTopp Fabric Protectant, which essentially meant that it has the recommendation of the Hartz Fabric Company recommendation.  I have used this product before and it worked, but this year it was a disaster.  First of all they changed the spray nozzle on the aerosol can to produce an extremely fine spray.  Whatever their reason for this was it now means that it is impossible to use this product outdoors as the slightest of breezes sends it off into the wind.  You must apply it in a garage setting only.  Secondly when my small top failed to bead water after apply three coats per the directions I contacted the manufacture to try to understand what went wrong.  They were far from professional, in fact I would characterize their behavior as nothing less than insane.  First telling me that I did not apply enough.  Then telling me that I applied too much.  And a few other really bizarre comments were sent to me written in all capital letters!  It appears that this company is really just a one man and a bitter and unhappy fellow at that!  But the good news is that this interesting information that I would like to share with you.  This is not the only option for fabric top protectant.  And of the alternatives there is one that had been the defacto Hartz recommended product for over 20 years (RaggTopp was only recommended by them for the last few years - do I smell a bribe, or should I say paid product endorsement?).  The alternative is a product called 303 Protectant - High Tech Fabric Guard.  It is available from Amazon and it is less expensive than Raggtopp.  303 also makes a fabric cleaner.  And 303 has a manual pump spray which allows for much greater control in applying the product.  My top beads water again thanks to 303.  Goodbye RaggTopp, your horrible customer server has turned me and now everyone in my roadster auto club off of your products for good.	-1

Went too use can was empty	-1
Purchased this item locally to seal my saab 9-3 convertible top. It repelled water when it began to rain lightly, but as the rain got heavier, the protection didn't work. Also using this an a spray is a total waste of money. I cleaned my canvas top before applying then applied multiple coats. There are much better products on the market.	-1
So so	-1
Arrived in envelope-style mailer with lid loose in package.  The propellent was gone.  So, I received a nearly full can that wouldn't spray.  Shipper should have taped lid onto can or shipped in a more protected package.  Anyway, I cut the can open and attempted to use by wiping remaining contents onto surface with a rag.  Wish I hadn't.  Resulted in shiny, streaky mess that looks horrible the next day with pollen and dust collecting as if it were flypaper.  Likely would have resulted in a much better appearance had it been properly applied.  Do I recommend this product or this seller--no, I do not.  I have more than $10 worth of work cleaning up this mess and another $10 in wasted product--shame on me twice...	-1
Did not work at all just made everything greesy and after a day it collects dust like crazy, ,package was a mess lids were all off cans ,do not buy this product from this seller	-1
tried this out because it was cheaper than buying other brands, however found that deep penetrated spots will rise back up through carpet with this stuff.  I had better luck using Folex Spot Remover which is a bit more expensive.	-1
Okay, call me the dummy.  The spray treatment for the top lasted for ONE coating or application-not several as I had been led to believe. And the cleaner?....mix some simple green in warm water and use a small scrub brush. Despite all the rave reviews, I have this sick feeling I've just been hustled!	-1
Big fan of Stoner products, but Trim Shine should only be used for internal areas, unless you wish to keep detailing the same panels over and over.  The 5 gallon container of Trim Shine does not have the water resistant properties as the spray cans, so beware. The spray can product makes panels look nice, and withstands rain, but only for a week or two.  Very disappointed.	-1
I do not get the product so I have no comment.	-1
SMELL LIKE WINDEX	-1
this stuff shut down every 2 stroke motor i put it in. Not sure what to think. Definitly not for lawn equipment. Maybe for boats or snowmobiles. Down to 2 stars for me.	-1
I have 3 kids who love yogurt. Well most day's it ends up on the carpet or the couch so I decided to try this. Well it didn't work and the chemical's hurt my nose. Wouldn't recommend	-1
I recently purchased this product via Summit Racing in order to enhance the security system already on the vehicle. I must admit the product doesn't lack effort on the part of its designers, but falls short in a couple or so areas.  1. As with most steering wheel locks, can be easily defeated by simply cutting the steering wheel and discarding the product. Although the alarm is loud, 130db isn't sufficient enough to cause a loud disturbence. Sounds like a smoke alarm siren to some degree outside of the vehicle. Oh yeah, that'll scare the thief off. Alerts for 40 seconds, and then resets itself, not enough time.  2. The unit is battery operated by nature, thus there are two screws located on the bottom of the battery compartment. Know where I'm going?? Sure you do, they are standard phillips heads, allowing for either the battery to be removed or wires cut to siren doing a theft of the vehicle. It only takes a few seconds to unscrew the screws and cut the wire to the siren and I'm an average do-gooder.  3. The remote to the alarm resembles a cheap childrens toy. It lasted a few months before communication was lost between the remote and recieving unit. Conviently after the warranty period had elapsed.  Overall, it is a decent product(being generous). Replacement screws, requiring a hex key, will only cost a couple of bucks at a local hardware store. 2. Theft-deterrent not theft-proof are the key words.  I recommend the club 491 (for cars and trucks) or the Club 493 for motorcycles and smaller tires. The earlier of which I've purchased and should receive this coming Friday.  *** As with any theft-deterrent, if a thief wants it, they'll get it and you if necessary. No product is fool-proof or perfect.  Hopefully my first review will help someone.  I'M MR. COOPER. THAT'S MY TWO CENTS. NOW SPEND IT WISELY.	-1
Standard, nothing more	-1
Would not waste my time on this. I have decided to go for the EZ Red Hydrometer from now on (I have purchased quite a few EZ Reds since then). The glass broke because a small pebble accidentally fell on it. Way too fragile for my liking. And it does not 'suck up' like the EZ Red. It still works though. Please do not get me wrong.	-1
I bought this a couple of years ago and I still have it. It never read right from the get-go and still to this day it reads wrong, same reading every cell no matter what battery. I try it occasionally, thinking it might work one day or that I was doing it wrong. I had and still use one of those cheap hydrometers with the sideways dial and when buying this, I thought I was making an upgrade but I guess I was wrong. I imagine they work for other people as I read the reviews, but I must have got the lemon. So, it sits there looking pretty but essentially useless. It reminds me of my Ex.	-1
TSB 21-010-04 specifies this fluid (MS-9224) for the new 6-speed manual in the Liberty and the Wrangler.  In my Wrangler, it actually shifts better than the factory fill did!  You'll need 1.6L to do the job.  Edit: Shifting performance degraded quite rapidly.  Transmission developed a neutral gear rattle which suggests that this fluid thinned out.  I no longer recommend this for the Jeep 6-speed regardless of the manufacturer's opinion.	-1
I was a bit surprised by all the great reviews.  It sprays on so heavy it makes a mess.  The liquid is great, I just wish it sprayed finer.  I'll be switching to something else. ** Updated review one month latger **  They should rename this SPRAY ADHESIVE!! I sprayed this all over my perfectly clean motor, new carb, AN stainless fittings, aluminum valve covers...and it's BAKED ON!!!!  HOW DO I GET THIS OFF????  I had to used acetone to get it off the valve covers and air cleaner, but I can spray this all over the engine on my 71 Charger.  Damn I'm MAD!!!	-1
Makes the engine pop.  Leaves an oily residue in valleys of engine.  Smells horrible and the smell lasts quite a while.  Getting gas in my classic car, a person complimented me on the car and asked if I had just painted it.  Said it was the engine dressing. Will be looking for something different.	-1
As a relatively new cloth convertible top owner I wanted to pro-actively take good care of my top from the start. All roads lead to RaggTopp Fabric Protectant, which essentially meant that it has the recommendation of the Hartz Fabric Company recommendation. I used this product once and it worked ok.  Now a year later and ready for another treatment I tried it again and it was a disaster. First of all they changed the spray nozzle on the aerosol can to produce an extremely fine spray.

This is the worst smelling stuff I've used on a car.  I washed the engine at least three times with soap and degreaser and it still smells after driving.  It has been over a month since I applied it after washing.  The smell reminds me of burnt model engine fuel only worse.	-1
What I ordered and received were two entirely different items. The can is different and says that is stage 3 in a series; 1-2-3. However, since I maintain a clean engine a bay I thought, go ahead. I did wipe down everything that I could, followed the instructions and sited for it to dry. Before I  closed the hood to dry everything looked great. But shortly after driving I was greeted with a horrible smell. Like a cross between dry cleaning fluid and trans. fluid. No way near a pleasant citrus smell. It's bad that part is now I need to clean everything and throw the remaining away. I trusted Gunk, so I was surprised and dejected. My suggestion, DON'T BUY!	-1
It pains me to give this product even 1 star!!!  I might have well been applying water to my convertible top. Picked up some STAR BRITE water proofing and it was game over!!!!  My top didn't leak one single drop!!!!  Nuff said!!	-1
I applied the product as directed and it has not impressed me at all. My fabric top still soaks up rain. It doesn't bead up as promised and would not recommed this product.	-1
ok	-1
It's a solid gun but I used it 5 times in the last year and a half and now it's impossible to keep the plunger locked back to load it, it keeps slipping off the body, which makes loading it very difficult. I can't believe they still use this method to lock the plunger back while there are so many other better ways to do it.	-1
It was shipped fast and was the biggest piece of junk that I've bought in a long time. It leaked from the very first time that I put grease in it. I got it to pump about 4oz of grease before it stopped working.	-1
I just watched a tv commercial about this stuff and wonder how it worked ? After reading up about it and reading the reviews, both good and bad, I thought I would toss my two cents in. I have never used this stuff, but I am a retired mechanic. First off, this stuff works when it comes.into contact with moisture, which moisture in a. AC system is bad, your AC system is a sealed.system to keep moisture out. So when it finds a leak or any moisture, it starts the process of sealing it, like clogging. Which is great, but now it works wherever moisture is, so if there is a place and no leak but some moisture, guess what, that moisture activates this product to work then. So as so people said there orifice tube was clogged, because there was moisture there, now the orifice tube is a fine mesh screen, to help collect small metal shaving pieces to not run though the system, so if there is moisture there, then it clogs the screen which then will shut your system down. Now as.for.taking your car to.a mechanic later.after you.used this.stuff to have any work done on your AC, well a $100 repair will turn into.a much big.one !  Because they have to pump/vacuum all your R134 out and all this stuff along with flushing the.system, now that's if they will even go this far after find this.stuff in your system. Now yes I will support stuff that works great to fix stuff, but if in the long run it will do more bad then good, then I will not ! So if you have an older car, were it would cost more to fix then.what you paid for the car, then.go for it, but remember what could happen, but if you have a newer car and is.going to keep it long, then fix it right, it will pay for itself in the long run. To help.to keep your. AC working good, run it once a month, or in the winter use your defrost, which uses your AC to help defrost your Windows, its when your AC is not being used, thats when seals and gaskets dry up, shrink and leaks your R134 out. So if your car sits, run.the. AC once a month, just like when you start it to charge the battery, turn your AC on. Again I never used this, and thought I would.give my two cents here.	-1
Are you feeling lucky?  Really lucky? Then go ahead and try this in your ac system.  Here is the problem.  When it does not work, or the problem can not be fixed by a miracle in a can, then you have contaminated your system.  The first thing any shop will do is run a test to detect the presence of sealers like this.  They do so because this stuff will destroy their serial thousand dollars worth of AC recovery and recharge equipment.  At that point they will inform you that you need to replace all of the contaminated components in your system before they can do even basic service.  This means everything, your compressor, your condensor, your evaporator, etc.	-1
I got the old switch and bait. LOOKS like the gun but it isnt. In the description and in the box it says 7500 psi max hose. I got a thin weak hose 3500psi max. In the box and on site description it SHOWS the air release valve were you can hand tighten it. I got a cheap valve that you have to tight with a hex key. In the box you can see the LINCOLN brand on the top between the two handles. I did not get that one. In the photo the pump handle is blue. I didn't get that one either.  Finally in the blue tube it has the brand name XNMH. made in china fake.  To top it all off IT DIDNT EVEN WORK!. For those who give this product a 1 out of 5 I think they got the switch and bait too. I don't think its a problem with amazon as a whole. I think its the problem of a few single people switching it and giving it to amazon to sell it. Please click helpfull button so other buyers will be aware.	-1
Not sure what's up but this thing is leaking like a sieve.	-1
I used this product and added it to my air cond system and it apparently work too well .I cannot add any new refrigerant , I try right after adding and t would not go in. Do not buy this product unless you have completely add new refig.and may never be allowed.	-1
Terrible detailer, spots, streaks and leaves a white residue despite buffing with a clean terry cloth. i had to buy another brand to take out the white residue. will not buy again.	-1
Broke from the start, ive owned multiple grease guns. this one must have been defective, need to return	-1
Purchased a Lincoln as a heard they were the best and I like to only buy tools once.  I read the poorly written instructions, and loaded up the grease.  Opened the bleed screw at the top until some oozed out and attempted to pump.  Pump had no resistance except for the last centimeter or so and nothing came out.  I tried and tried and nothing happened.  I pull the plunger out and push the plunger back in really hard, with still nothing coming out of end of hose.  I open it up to find that I pushed the plunger all the way through my $9 tube of grease.  Im frustrated at this point and have the entire thing covered in grease.  I clean it really well with some shine and leave it out overnight.  The next morning most of the finish on the pump is spotted and ruined.  I'm pissed at this point and I knew that the finish was my fault but i figure it should still work.  This time I buy a new tube of $4 grease and load it up.  I don't attach the hose and it pumps out the front no problem.  I attach the hose and it goes right back to nothing coming out the end.  I concluded the hose or seals inside the hose are crap and clogged up.  I wasted $13 on grease on this POS and got really mad.  Thankfully Amazon accepts my return even though I mess up the finish.  I purchase a Plews Lubrimatic from Walmart for a little more then half the price and it works perfect the first time and comes with a hose and a solid barrel fitting.  Way better deal and piece of equipment.	-1
It leaks out of the bottom. I had to send it back. Only used a few times.	-1
Started out okay for the first few times I used it, then it started pushing grease around the zerks instead of into them. no matter what i tried, i couldn't get it to work on any of my standard zerks. Total waste of money.	-1
Was not what I was expecting, Did very little for improving the looks of my tonneau cover on my pick up. Would not recommend this product to anyone. My tonneau looks just as good after being washed.	-1
Very difficult product to use. The import fitting leaks and makes a mess. Cleaning product can be a challenge. I've had very little success using this tool and getting the air removed from brake systems	-1
Poor quality. As another reviewer said, the rubber piece that grabs the spark plug does not stay attached to the socket.  It came off with my first plug change. Since the rubber piece stays with the spark plug, after installing a plug the rubber piece stays with the plug in your engine. Maybe super glue is the answer, but I should not have to do that to make this work.	-1
On the third spark plug I was removing with this tool, the top part of the handle broke.  This is made of very poor craftsmanship.  Sure it's only a bit over $6, but that doesn't matter.  I was only able to remove two spark plugs and then it was rendered useless.  Steer very clear of this product spend an extra few bucks for a better tool.	-1
It didn't work!  I removed my O2 sensor and needed to clean out the threads, and it was chewed up in minutes!  I purchased an M18 x 1.5 tap and die, and it did the trick!  I tapped the manifold several times and it cut/cleaned out the threads easily!  The metal that this product is made of seemed to be too soft, and was damaged very easy.	-1
I had a steering wheel puller set (Lisle 45000), but needed a pair of puller legs for removing a steering wheel without threaded holes.  I bought this set to get them, because this set was cheaper than getting the puller legs by themselves.  Those work very well, but one of the threaded bolts bent as I attempted to remove a steering wheel on a different vehicle. Update (4/17/15): one of the puller legs broke when attempting to remove a steering whee that didn't have threaded holesl. This was only the second time I used the puller legs! This would have been a one-star review if it had cost me more.	-1
I ordered this product thinking that i would receive 12 cans since is says "12 pack" in the product description. I only received one can with a broken cap. I am very disappointed in my purchase, I won't be buying it again.	-1
Good news is it dissolves everything, bad news is it also dissolves everything.  This product damaged the rubber vacuum diaphragms in my carbs, which I had to replace.  Instructions and fine print do not disclose anything about compatibility with rubber and other materials.  Use at risk.  Perhaps best used only on completely disassembled carbs with all rubber bits removed.  Learn from my mistake.	-1
"The reason I purchased this product is because of the promise to clean just about anything." I have a few small rust spots on a bathroom floor and a I wanted to try it on oil in my driveway. This stuff is a joke. It not only didn't work at all, it has a citrus odor that is horrible! The rust stains are just sticky now and the oil stains are there and not at all cleaned up. Read the statements.. this spray cleaner is supposed to cut through grease and grime and everything else it touches. You are better off with Industrial cleaners that you know and trust can do the job. This product was a complate waste of money and time!	-1
Does NOT auto shutoff.  would like to return, but too much trouble....don't waste your money	-1
Stoner's "More Shine" is an alternative to the murmurous tire dressing gels on the market. I switched from the gels to More Shine in 2012 to avoid the messy application process and for the nice matte-to-medium appearance More Shine provides . You just simply spray it on and you're done. Over-spray on the wheels is much less evident. Fair price.  So why the two star rating? My big complaint is the sling. No matter how long I left it on the tires to dry  - overnight, over the weekend, (Stoner recommends 45 minutes before driving) the product would sling. The only times that I did lessen the sling was to leave it outside on a really hot, sunny day and let it bake on. Washing/waxing a car is one of those instant gratification tasks. It's also hard work for a guy with all kinds of skeletal and arthritic problems. So to drive my car a few miles only to have the rockers and painted rims smeared with brown/black goo wasn't acceptable to me anymore. After some research, I tried Chemical Guy's G6 Hyper Coat High Gloss Dressing. Hands down the best product for plastic maintenance/restoration. It's also a great tire dressing that will not sling.	-1
Not worth the money	-1
Cheap product, have broken 2 of these. The spring that compresses when you push down breaks the plastic spout, can't repair once broken. Back to the old funnel & distilled water method!!	-1
If you use this stuff make sure you cover the paint around your top. I did not find it to repel the ran as I expected. I have a small top and will not use this product again.	-1
Very disappointing product, especially for the price. Expensive and doesn't work as well as Meguiars Ultimate line. I will stick with Meguiars Ultimate line.	-1
Almost the same review as BBD, really kind of upset I spent the money on this, followed the directions to a T, even spent the time to tape off the top.  Here is BBD review: I washed the top as instructed, which worked very nicely. However, the sealant makes a big mess because of the nozzle dripping, as others have noted. Also, after applying two coats, which used the entire bottle of sealant, I went out to check out the "beading" action after a recent rain less than 5 days after treating, and found the top saturated as if nothing had been applied. Disappointing after all the work cleaning up the overspray and drips from the car's paint and glass.	-1
Bought this tool to replace the coilovers on my 1999 Miata. Used it again to replace the struts on my 2002 Protege`. Even though I had the screws well lubricated one of the nuts seized while doing the Protege` job. The threads are pretty well galled up on one of the tools now and I don't know if I want to continue to trust the safe operation of the tool.	-1
I do a lot of work on vintage muscle cars and reciently I needed an spring compressor to change coil springs in a 69 Nova. I purchased this item and on receiving it tried many times to get this tool to work. It would not hold and continued to slip off the coil. (Very Dangerous) on finally making the tool stay on the coil the tool bent before compressing the spring enough to replace. Very poor quality. I have called several times to the customer service with no answer or return call. ???	-1
Did nothing in effectively clean the top... soap and water just as useful	-1
Mild soapy water will get the same results. Not impressed.	-1
If all you want to do is check the gap of your spark plugs, then this tool will be fine. If you need to adjust the gap of your spark plug, then don't use this tool it will bend. This tool does not have the strength to bend the electrode of the spark plug, The tool will bend instead. I purchased mine from O'Reilly Auto Parts. I purchased A Craftsman from Sears that works perfect every time for $1.99 as a replacement and threw the cheap China made one in the trash.	-1
I had misplaced my spark plug tool and needed one on short notice. I should have known not to take a chance on another worthless tool made in China. Instead of adjusting the gap on my NGK spark plug, this tool just bent like it was made from a beer can. Spend a few more cents and don't play into the cynical business-model practiced by Wilmar aka Performance Tool. They just expect that you won't bother to return it.	-1
I had to grind it down to fit an 05 Ford Freestar strut mount	-1
All I can say is.....eh.  I'm not sure what car you're working on but if you have a compass/patriot or a crown victoria/grand marquis  this tool won't work for you.  Its sad....very sad.  It has so much potential but the sizes included for the struts don't work on these cars.  I know it will work on other models perfectly if you don't have the luxury of air powered tools in your garage.  It WILL save you A TON OF TIME with hand tools.  I guess it's just buy it and try it, its a real simple tool that i'm confident will work but its mainly the vehicle's strut design that will determine the usefullness.	-1
Does not work on BMW struts	-1
I was so happy to get this belt tool for my car. When the tool set arrived it was covered in greased, and so many parts were already broken. I went and sent it back, and to my surprise I received the same used crap i got before. Even though they were great fast return, the product stinks the big one. Would never by at all.	-1
Tried it as soon as I received it, and found out it is "NOT" worth it. I was going to inquire as to returning it, And I do have it boxed up and ready, but then I would need to pay restock and return shipping, so I'd rather not deal with it. "Pay" the extra "Buck" and buy the real thing!!	-1
Its a little difficult to work with. The clips do not like to stay in place while compressing a spring. Found zipties and a jig made it work.	-1
This thing is a pile of garbage. This was the only type of compressor I could find that would fit my job, and it sucks. It doesn't compress the spring straight, and slips horribly. Unless you have hours and hours to screw around with this, I wouldn't recommend it.	-1
First take a shallow or deep metric or SAE socket to see what exactly fits.  A 1996 Ford Contour needs to use the 18mm spark plug socket wrench, like the Motion Pro Spark Plug Socket 18mm with 12 points and an end that will accept a 13/16 crow foot flare nut wrench for torquing the strut nuts back on.  12 points and flare nut crow foot wrench will have better grip, than a 6 point. Although the 6 point wrenches and sockets are cheaper, and you'll want to have the spring coil compressed all the way any way, but 12 points are just better to avoid rounding the nuts off if they're not impact sockets.  The adapter here is for a 3/4" strut nut.  Cannot see how it works if you have to hold the strut rod with a 6mm allen wrench while turning the strut nut counter clockwise/clockwise with a 13/16 combination wrench (taking it off) or 13/16 crow foot flare nut wrench (putting on) the crow foot goes on a torque wrench to specific pound. Then you install it back on the car/truck, then torque the strut nut on top, sticking out under the hood. You have to hold the strut rod with the allen key either taking the nuts off or on and to torque them back on.  You'll use the crow foot wrench set any way, but you can buy them single.	-1
This kit did not work as designed. The socket is too short and fat to be usable for the intended purpose. Furthermore, if you try to use the 19mm (3/4") insert, it must go on the fattest end of the socket. It will never work there even if you try to grind down the sides because the socket will become too thin. I was able to grind down the outside of the narrowest part of the socket so I could insert it into the strut mount. The socket was larger than the 19mm nut on the strut, but it still worked good enough to get the nut off while holding the strut shaft with a socket, extension, and ratchet. However, the strut shaft was made for a metric socket that was not part of this kit. I had to use other tools. The chrome slot tools did not fit the new strut shafts well enough to hold them snugly, but was usable enough to hold them. However, one strut slot broke off after it became wedged in the chrome slot socket. I had to drill it out. I would suggest for a person to get the actual deep-well off-set socket for their exact size strut nut. With that said, the factory size nuts and the nuts shipped with a strut can differ. You really need to check your strut nut on the car and the strut nut shipped with the new strut before buying a socket. This kit should have four separate DEEP sockets instead of trying to cheap-out with one. I would have sent this back, but I ground the socket to get it to work. I was not about to have my car tore apart waiting for another tool.	-1
Will resell this item.  It needs a ratchet on it to work right	-1
Fantastic or 409 does a better job than this overpriced cleaner.  Repeated cleaning process three times with this product and didn't see the results they claim  this product gives.  Save your money and buy some 409 or Fantastic and get the same or better results.  Over priced, over advertised on what it will do.  I was very disappointed with this product(s).	-1
This tool is poorly made.  The gapping portion is weak sheet metal that bends immediately.  Feeler gauges would be a better choice.	-1
excelente	-1
the adjuster on this is horrible, weak and flimsy..  I am past return status.  Bummer	-1
Product doesn't work very well. When attaching one side it doesn't give enough room to place the Spring Compressor on the other. Luckily I was able to get by with just one.  I bought a crappy pair from the likes of autozone and it worked much better.	-1
Before purchasing I talked to Wilmar to ask if the threads on the threaded rods were "Acme" threads and was told they were.  When the tool arrived the threads were standard.  I returned the tool and purchased another that stated Acme threads on the package.  The amount of pressure this tool experiences makes Acme threads important.	-1
For the price it is a below average tool. No box and annoying clam shell packaging. But this tool does have has a good reach and serves the purpose of releasing the 'tension on the tensioner pulley to replace belt and/or remove belt from alternator for replacing it... Though, the tool I got has (unlike the photo on Amazon)  the 3 hex bits chrome plated and not black steel like in the first 2 photos. But now  I just noticed the 3rd photo of the clam shell package shows the Chrome hex. That's very misleading... Not sure if I'll return it and get the oemtools tool. One interesting difference is that the oemtools has 1/2" on the handle and 3/8" on the extension and the hex bits are 3/8 size. This tool has 3/8 on the handle and 1/2 on the extension and the hex bits are 3/8. So with this tool the extension can't be used with the bits but with the oemtools they can(and the oemtools has a box and only a couple of bucks more...)  Unfortunately the description on this product does not say that. Again very misleading.... Update: Well actually both photo 1 and 2 of the product are wrong. Only photo 3  shows the actual product that you'll get. Also, I checked the back of the clamshell packaging that has the description/instructions. It looks like the small bar is NOT an extension(unlike the other belt tools) It is for specific brand of cars it seems, so that explains the mystery of the 1/2" and 3/8".. I'm returning this as I can get a oemtools or other brand tool with a bar extension and a storage box for only a couple more bucks. Also lowering the rating from 2 to 1 star.	-1
Seems to be fairly well made, but far from a universal fit tool.  No way to get it to help with the belt on my 6.0L Powerstroke  diesel.	-1
The gap adjusting tang bent the first time gapping a plug. Don't waste your money	-1
the clearance between the tools is to tight and I would not allow me to turn strut nut until I ground strut holding tool down. It did accomplish the job for not much money. you get what you pay for.	-1
Falls apart way too easy in use. Very disappointing and difficult to use. Find another brand.	-1
I bought one of these from Summit Racing in 2009 and couldn't get it to work right on a 65 Mustang I had borrowed and used a kd brand years ago with no issues.  On this one the hooks will not fit in between the coils and each hook needed to be trimmed shorter with a cutoff tool to fit. Then the threaded shaft was too long and I had to cut that shorter too.  Look else ware	-1
it seem to be ok i have not used it my spring set up did not work how ever it did seem to be a nice quality	-1
I bought it because of the small mm increments that I need. But it turns out it doesn't work like that. I cannot measure gaps of e.g. .13 or other even though it is stated in the ad. Looking at the tool, it seems that each blade has two sizes, the smallest mm size being .10 going up in .05 increments. No way to measure a 0.11, 0.12, 0.13 Etc to me, it is useless and unfortunately money lost. the build quality itself is very good and it is covered with a thin layer of oil. I am going to contact the seller to see what is going on.	-1
This tool didn't work for me it totally different from all the different pieces advertised, l try to use once but didn't work for me	-1
Not happy.  I double checked the parts included with this and it indeed appears to match the unit put out by Harbor Freight, which was where I bought mine.  The biggest problem I ran into was that I could only do half the job of changing the belt!  I was also replacing the tensioner and idler pulleys while I was at it (another disappointment found in the Continental review I did) and found after tensioner replacement that NONE of the existing "crowsfoot" ends included with this would fit the new tensioner (the new tensioner had a 16mm end, but there is not enough room to get the socket with this kit in there and the biggest 15mm crowsfoot is too small).  So, what I had to do in a pinch, was couple the longest 16mm crescent wrench I had to the bar of this with hose clamps.  Got the job done but barely as the hose clamps even caused some spacing problems.  I would have returned this if I would have had discovered that I didn't have the needed crowsfoot before I had everything already torn apart!	-1
Good	-1
Bought this at Walmart but is the same tool that Amazon sells. Just have to leave feedback to other Amazon shoppers that this is JUNK!!! Do not buy. Broke on the first use...	-1
OK, said it was for GM cars.  Well I have tried to use it on 2 now with no luck.  The open ended wrenches that fit on the bar are all to small to fit the tentioner.  I am sure if they fit I would be a lot happier, but they really need to be clear or offer additional pieced to ensure it fits.  I was working on a 2008 Impala and a 2008 Uplander.	-1
Doesn't fit my lugs yet it is universal.  It's useless to me.	-1
For my purpose this was a total waste of money.  I was trying to clean mildew spots from a canvas top.  It makes no sense to me that a cleaner for vinyl is also the best product for canvas so I was looking for a product specifically for fabric (canvas tops).  The description for this is Convertible Fabric Top Cleaner.  However, it is like most, a cleaner for vinyl and canvas.  Well I not only wasted money but time as well.  I worked and worked with the 303 cleaner.  It may as well have been a bottle of spring water.  I gave up on the 303 and out of desperation tried Oxyclean laundry powder.  I wet the top and brushed the Oxyclean onto the top with a horse hair brush.  I let it sit in the shade for about 20 minutes and rinsed while again brushing.  I was amazed at how much better the top looked so a repeated the process.  The top looks almost new.  For normal cleaning at wash time the 303 might work but if you are after mildew, I recommend you save your money.	-1
Product does not work on 17MM like stated.  I received a refund.  The overall quality seems good but if the lugs are the wrong size, what good is it?	-1
Look other's said this is SAE, not metric, false advertisement = 1 star. Also this thing being on 14 inches doesn't provide the amount of torque needed to tighten the lug nuts properly.  I'd avoid this and just buy the proper tool.	-1
Not a very good product for Jeep Gran Cherokee. Didn't work.	-1
Not much to this tool. I only reduced stars due to receiving a different brand than is shown here. (part # correct, different jippo handle).	-1
Didn't work well for me. The space between the two metal protrusions is too wide so the belt comes off too easily and doesn't do a good job of holding the belt so routing with this tool is almost useless. It. It is better than nothing but just barely. I haven't tried the other version on Amazon made by OTC. That one seems better as it has an extra slot to help hold the belt better which would make sense. Also the metal is too slippery so it doesn't keep the belt on the tool and always falls off the tool. The tool should be rubberized at least in the area where it comes into contact with the belt. This would keep the belt on better with a rubber grip. Also would be nice if the long shaft would be collapsible for storage and for better flexibility when it comes to access in tight areas and offer better control if it can be shortened at will.	-1
Not very well made	-1
Did not work so well, used BMW sealer which worked great	-1
First, the product image is outdated and shows a different tool.  Second, when I opened the amazon box, the tool was separate from the manufacturer's packaging, which means I may have received a used tool.  Lastly, the hook piece is not aligned perfectly with the handle.  Overall, I'm not overly pleased.  The tool will work fine, but the shipping and quality of the tool is not first rate.	-1
This thing literally crumbled in my hands - snapped at the hinge.  Upon closer inspection I found two things had failed on it.  The set screw at the hinge (Philips-head screw, and a Philips-head nut) was manufactured with stripped threads, the Philips-head screw fell out and would not re-thread, even by hand.  When the screw backed itself out and fell under the car, the remaining part of the hinge had too much pressure and snapped.  Of course the socket that broke was the one I needed - and I was miles from my main toolbox.  The only good news is I discovered this within a week of purchase, I'll be sending it back.  I don't want another of these, even if it's free.  Imagine if you were stuck on the side of the road, at night, in the rain with tools that break within the first 10 minutes of use.  Safety hazard.	-1
Didnt clean it at all, looks  the same with the same black spots!  I did not notice any dirty water coming off when I rinsed it !!!!!	-1
On a cold, rainy day in November I noticed my convertible top was soaked through so I went online and found this.  Highly reviewed and recommended on many forums. I couldn't wait to apply it, but to my dismay, when the product arrived, I found out that it has to be a warm, sunny day for it to even cure properly. The bottle says apply at 70 F and up and the forecast is all below 50 F. I think this is something that should be stated on the product info so that people don't buy and just have it sitting in their garage for months before they can use it. At this price I wouldn't want to apply it and then find out it didn't work. So here I am, still cold, still raining, it is now late January and I am just waiting for a warm sunny day to use this.	-1
This is not an SAE specific lug wrench.  It is a universal fit SAE and metric wrench.  The fit on SAE lug nuts is loose and sloppy.  I was very disappointed.  In the past a universal fit wrench had rounded off the edges of SAE lug nuts that were rusted in place and I do not want to have that risk again.  This wrench is sturdy but it is not what I thought I was buying.	-1
Not as good as advertised. Cleaner didn't work any better than soap and water. Followed directions to the letter. Sealer doesn't seem to last. Applied two coats. Used up the whole bottle of sealer. After 2nd rain storm water didn't bead up anymore. Not worth the money.	-1
For some reason I thought that 14" would be long enough, well it isn't. I would never use this wrench to tighten your lug nuts, they will still be loose and could ENDANGER YOUR LIFE. Seriously, you get what you pay for. The nice silver/chrome finish is just cheap paint and like others have stated it is NOT metric. What a waste!  Only reason why this gets 2 stars is because it looks nice and it was only $12.  I'd return it but it wouldn't be worth the hassle. It's essentially a shiny paper weight.	-1
I had to grind it down to fit an 05 Ford Freestar strut mount	-1

Cleaner works very well. Top treatment........not as well as I hoped. Water beads off only with light rain, if it rains all day, or HARD - it really doesn't seem to be any better than when it was untreated. I will try a different brand next time.	-1
These are garbage. they would barely hold onto the valve and i spent more time cleaing the valve than i did lapping them. a complete pain. They sell the same ones at oreilly.	-1
I might be using these incorrectly... For me, they wouldn't hold to the valve so lapping was painfully inefficient, just kept sliding around and not turning the valve. I ended up using a vacuum hose in a drill chuck of my electric drill and then over the valve stem which worked great. I then put these to the side...	-1
You get what you pay for	-1
Cheaper made than most. I used it until the cup shredded.  I will look for a better brand.	-1

It should be known that I attempted to use this on a Honda Civic (D16Y7) The off level jaws made it impossible to grab valve springs. Apparently they are that way to make it easier to grab into springs, but it didn't work for me.  Also, as the tool is tightened to compress the spring, the slider (silver in the picture), moves down , spreading the jaws apart, releasing the spring. All in all, I tried this and immediately sent it back. I had better luck with a 3/8" box end wrench and pushing the springs into place by hand. Not something I advise, but that worked while this tool didn't.	-1
The seem nice, but the suction cups let go really easy	-1
Garbage product.  Cups are hard rubber, deformed by packaging and don't maintain suction even after a lick and stick. Or wax.  Anything tried.  I got two twists per suction out of these before they let go.  Nothing like old sets.	-1
Well made but too small to fit on my tie rod ends	-1
Might work on some vehicles - but certainly didn't on the two I tried it on.  Literally thrown in the garbage after 2 tries.	-1
Looks to be well made but I am very disappointed that the opening of the top piece is too small to go around the ball joint stud on a 2003 Honda Accord.  Just needs to be about one eighth wider to work.  Had to obtain and use another tool to do the job.	-1
The flat black paint is nearly impossible to work with. The paint clogs the nozzle in short or long term use, regardless of temperature. The paint doesn't always mix properly, which leads to improper spray pattern and won't let paint cure properly. The nozzle also leaks causing paint to run down your hand. All directions and conditions were followed.	-1
Paint clogs nozzle in short or long term use, regardless of temperature. Paint doesn't always mix properly, which leads to improper spray pattern and won't let paint cure properly. Nozzle leaks leaving paint all over your hands. All directions and conditions followed.	-1
Maybe a bad can, but the only way the paint fully sprayed properly was upside down. Which isn't proper at all. Coat sucked also. Very disappointed in this purchase. Total waste of money and added a lot of work for me with re-sanding and prepping.	-1
I have used lots of things to clean my tops over the years as I have owned several convertibles. Raggtopp is just average. There are things which work better for me.	-1
Paint is okay and the PlastiKote brand is generally okay, in this instance the color does not match the cap and the nozzle on this particular version of can is way too broad. I think they sacrificed a good spray pattern in return for a 'locking' can that is hard to spray in the store.	-1
I ordered multiple cans. I used one partially, cleared it, and went to use it a week later and nothing came out.  It was still approximately 80% full, but it was either clogged or out of aerosol as no paint would come out.  I'm currently using the second can and it is working fine so far. Good coverage and it doesn't take much to coat the item (I was painting an engine block and heads).  The low star rating is primarily for, what I think, is a defective can.	-1
Maybe I got a bad batch, but I cleaned and painted my oil filler tube and it turned out baby blueish gray, but nothing I would call just "gray." Its also a very flat primer - no sheen at all and smudges and fingerprints betty easily. Now I have to reprint the darn thing...But, it is a thick paint and otherwise it's as-advertised - no issue with temperature, etc.	-1
Not well made. Kind of wobbly. Did not help with the brake springs on our Honda Civic at all.	-1
I could not figure this out for the life of me so used the c clamp and it worked.	-1
Spring installer does not work well at all.  Took a ton of fighting and finess to use this tool.  I feel as though I could have done an easier job with a regular old flat head screwdriver.	-1
This is totally useless. I bought to change the brakes of a corolla 2004 but these pliers are HUGE. Too big to work with it. You definitely do not need them.	-1
I bought this back in June to add to my tool box.  Planning to use it for bleeding brakes.  Took it out of its box for the first time today, March 2017, and found the clear tubing "glued" in several spots to the gray plastic tray.  Looks like the tray had melted to the tubing.  I was able to drain the master cylinder reservoir without any problem.  Refilled the master with clean brake fluid then I went back to to the right rear to bleed it.  Got a couple good pumps and would bleed.  Did that maybe 3 times when I noticed that I was only getting at most -5 psi no matter how many times I pumped.  Thought maybe the hose was too loose so I switched to some much better rubber hose.  Still no luck.  That's when I noticed a hair line crack on the right side just back from the gauge.  Over the next 30 minutes the thing just fell apart more and more as it sat on my tool box.  This thing is junk.  It could not stand up to 5 minutes of use, use that it specifically says it's meant for right on the box!	-1
Did not fit my 2001 VW Golf rear brake caliper. No idea what cars it does fit, but def not the 2001 VW Golf rear calipers.	-1
this tool is too short to exert leverage on the brake springs i have encountered  worse, the metal is very flimsy and flexes under load	-1
You will recieve some Chinese made junk. The Chinese junk model # is Performance Tool W1606. For $47.50 go to Sears.	-1
IT came apart after 5 minutes ,don't waste  you money	-1
Unfortunately it was too small for my application.  Just as well, because all you need is a Piece of bread and something about the same size diameter of hole,  use ductape around a bold or a socket extension to make it almost fit, and then stick the bread in hole and pound it down with your "ramrod" and just watch as your pilot bearing comes out.  It took less than a slice and I had my auto transmission pilot bearing out in less than 1 minute with no mess.  Search on youtube and you will see a video of it	-1
I attempted to use this "tool" to remove a clutch pilot bushing from a Nissan Xterra. The tip of the tool extended to far and bottomed  out on the crank preventing the tool from engaging the bushing. So I thought well that is easy I'll just cut it shorter. I cut it shorter and got it to thread into the bronze bushing. Got it snug hooked up the grease gun grease just squirted from the threads. Made a mess to clean bushing never shifted. I whipped it at the garbage can in disgust. Found a aluminum rod the size of the center of the pilot bushing. Packed it with grease and gave the rod a whack and the bushing slid right out.	-1
Not very useful, had a chance to try it on Honda Accord 2002 SE rear brake shoes.  I had hoped the tool would assist in removing the main brake adjuster spring, it did not.  I'm planing on rebending, retooling it and maybe it will be more helpful. Perhaps this works better on other style brakes.	-1
poor quality , should of bought a good one	-1
Considering the low price as opposed to the other cam gear tools, you should avoid this one.  I snapped off the gear on the camshaft where the tool was holding the teeth, cost me another 35 for the gear at a dealer.  The other tool I used was to hold the gear inside the body and it worked better for removal and install.  It looked like a u shaped tool, with a long handle wrapped in red plastic with a cost of 40 dollars Scheley.	-1
Very low-grade metal.  The notched spring tool broke the first time I used it.  I wasn't expecting snap-on quality, but this might as well have been made out of play-doh.	-1
Subject was a 1999-2001 era Suburban.  The installation tool needed a  3/8"-16tpi bolt to properly thread into the pump snout.  I made a tool that worked exactly the same with a simple carriage bolt, matching nut and lug stud installation bearing.  Also, after the first use of the puller the ball bearing fell out and bounced into a drain.  I'll continue my search for a quality puller/installer.	-1
If you own a GM Product this might work to remove the Power Steering Pulley. I own 2007 Chevy Avalanche 5.3L. It is the newer engine and body style. Trying to find a pulley remover to remove the pulley is difficult in itself. I tried a kit at my local auto parts store and didn't work. I bought another set and that didn't work. So i found this one and thought it would give it try. I didn't purchase this from Amazon, i found the exact same kit for $3 more than Amazon's price at a tool store in my local area. I brought it home and attempted to remove the pulley. I couldn't find many that have tired this on the newer engines rather just the old (2006 and below) so i couldn't get any feedback on what may or may not to do.  This goes for most never 2007 - 2013 Silverado, Tahoe, Suburban, Avalanche, Yukon with a 5.3L 1. Remove the belt by pulling the tensioner with a 15mm socket and ratchet. 2. I attempted to remove the pulley first because if you are unable to remove it with the tool then you just wasted your time removing anything else. Insert the remover into the shaft of the pulley. Using the two half's, put the larger side on tool the tool and the smaller side onto the puller and then side the metal sleeve over it. Tighten the nut until it contacts the back of the half's. *It is helpful with a ratchet and wrench, using two wrenches is difficult* Using a 16mm socket and ratchet at the end of the tool and a 21mm wrench on the tool. Wrench it off twisting it too loosen it until it the pulley comes off (You may hear noises when the pulley comes off, that's normal.) 3. After the pulley is off,  remove the fluid from the reservoir and remove the 16mm nut using a wrench (Stubby is better because of the tight area) from the pressure line at the back of the reservoir and set aside after remove the clamp from the return line and remove it from the pump. Remove the 3 bolts in the front of the power steering pump using a 15mm socket and ratchet. Remove the 2 15mm nuts and 1 15mm bolt for the bracket at the back of the pump. If you do it by the book, it states to remove the intermediate steering shaft. I am not sure why but that doesn't have to be done. I had lots of room to remove it, maybe on older models but on the newer ones it doesn't have to be done. 4. Remove the pump and reverse the install procedure in step 3. 5. Installing the pulley, this is where the fun began. I thought this would be the easiest step. I thought wrong! The installer tool was way tool long for my application. I had to cut the end of second threads of using a grinder. After cutting it off, the tool fit in properly. While installing the pulley i had trouble getting the pulley to fully seat on the end of the shaft. Every time i tightened it down the bolt would back out of the shaft and would just keep coming out of the shaft. I absolute tried everything to get that pulley on the shaft. As of now, the pulley sticks out about 1/4 inch because it wouldn't install the pulley any further. I have yet to find other tool to finish installing the pulley but it is on there to function and hopefully works while i find a tool to finish the job. 6. When you do complete the pulley install. Fill with fluid and check for leaks turning your steering from lock to lock!  The tool itself was returned even with the modification i had to do. This doesn't seem to work on newer styles rather than maybe old ones. The installer, all the threads were garbage when finished and wouldn't even thread into the shaft anymore. All the bolt heads were rounded due to the force from getting the pulley off and on. The remover worked quite well surprisingly but the installer didn't meet my expectations. This "tool" says heavy duty and i can stay from my experience this isn't even close to that. I can't say that this tool won't work for other applications because it just may but for my applications it did not perform. It was packaged back up and return to the store as soon as i had fluid flowing through my system. I am going to take the money and put it toward a much better and quality tool. Off to search for one! I do not recommended this product, save your money and invest it quality because at the end of the job you will say to yourself it was well worth it than fighting with a product that is garbage. *As a side note, the one reason i gave it two stars because it did in fact remove the pulley just didn't install the pulley.*	-1
Both tools broke with little force will be returning.	-1
NOT 2-3/4" Minimum Height as Advertised.  I had an application where I required something that would go under 2.9".  The minimum height for this jacket is about 3-1/8"  Manufactured in Communist China.	-1
Does not work with Wilmar W41044 transmission adapter. Had to return this item	-1
Complete junk, did last one pulley. The steel is way too soft. Totally waste of money.	-1
Unfortunately this tool is too loose to be trusted removing a power steering pulls.	-1
Finally got to use this after having it in my box for over 6 months.  First time I used it to hold a crank pulley on a 6.4 diesel to torque the balancer bolts.  The adjustment screw kept slipping.  Not real impressed with this one.	-1
This is really a very light weight jack. It is very narrow and therefore is easy to tip. The quality is just OK and the hydraulic piston is slow and not very good quality. Just not the best except for very infrequent use on a very smooth, flat, surface where you aren't lifting much weight. I wouldn't buy this again for any use.	-1
I had higher expectations, but when I saw the country of manufacture listed on the package, I knew it would be a crap-shoot.  The threads (nut & bolt) have significant galling. The machining is typical of Chinese quality control, hit and miss. QC seems more concerned with the black finish, ostensibly to protect against corrosion...yet the item was still coated with oil.  I'd rather have a properly machined and hardened tool in plain unfinished steel.  Fortunately, we purchased it via Prime so it is being returned as I write this.	-1
I would have given zero stars if possible. I paid $11.99 for one day shipping because I had to have this jack to work on my truck and it arrived with out the operating bar. I tried to use a long handle ratchet, but it would only go up to 12 inches! not the 15 that was advertised!!! This was a piece of junk. Now I have to try to go out and find one in town. Thanks for screwing me Amazon!!! Your the best!	-1
This thing blew out on me in no time.  Thankfully, Amazon has great customer service.  I purchased a much better quality jack at a major retailer that starts with Costc for $100 and is actually used by some race teams.  Stay away from this though, what a piece of tin can junk.	-1
First off, don't buy this.  This is a very small poorly constructed piece of what you likely need, a full pulley service kit.  At the price you can spend $10 more and get a decent kit.  Also, as a word of caution, make sure you do your research before you buy anything like this from Amazon.	-1
This tool will not fit the 2004 Ford Expedition Power Steering pump as advertised.	-1
it did not fit '95 lincoln continental.  i had to have a friend take me to auto parts store to get the right one (as my car was disassembled).  i suppose i should have read other comments wherein other posters had the same problem.  the seller listed it asl "For use on most Ford power steering pump pulleys" with no other relevant details available - now seems to be a lie.  the tool's quality seems good, seller seems bad.	-1
it was not the right one that I ask for it said that it was for my 2000 f150 4.2 engine but it wasn't very disappointed	-1
This will not fit into a 12v power outlet.  The end is too long (appears to only be designed to fit into deeper cigarette lighters).  It just keeps falling out.  Tried it in three different cars (none have cigarette lighters) - would not work in any of the 12v outlets.	-1
First it was flimsy, couldn't get it to stay in one position..using two 12 volt plug ins..hit a bump in the road and blew the fuse! Not worth the money or time.	-1
It is a cheap dollar store item you can buy at any dollar store for a $1.00 it is not made by bell it does not swivel it does not look like the pitcher at all .	-1
Don't use this crap in a newer engine. My 03 Nissan has been going through oil. I put this into my car and within 5 miles, failure. Car stalled and would barely run. Had to have the oil & filter changed including diagnostic time $85 shot.	-1
It is possible this is my error, but all 3 were used the same way.  I bought 3 of these for a project.  2 worked just fine and one started smoldering and melted down completely.  I will not be buying anymore of these.	-1
The fuse holders were improperly molded.  I bought 5 and could NOT force a 20 Amp fuse into any of them. The lugs were spaced too closely together.  I refuse to trim fuses to fit.  These folks should "waste" a 10 cent fuse and mold the parts with a fuse installed.  This might also prevent the other problem with 3 units where the lugs had been covered with over-flowed rubber or plastic.  Bottom line is that these were total garbage.	-1
NOT a #10!  Conductor diameter is .065 inches.  That is #14!!  SCAM!!  #10 measures .10190	-1
This fuse does NOT have 10AWG wire-its even marked 16AWG and looks it. You must use a Magnifying Glass to read it or at least I had to.	-1
I mostly gave it 1* because of false advertising.  The photo shows that it comes with a fuse, and it does not.  It was also exceedingly difficult to insert a fuse into the holder.  It took me several minutes of pushing very hard and wiggling until it finally got started into the clips.  I will use it and I expect it to perform properly, but I would not order another one.  Be sure to read the shipping time estimate.  It took 36 days to get here.	-1
This is not 10 AWG as described it is a 16 AWG (picture included) which is much smaller.	-1
Read the fine print.  Even though a fuse is shown in the photo, it is not included.  The wire ends also don't come finished.  Somehow I had to pay return shipping.  Complete deception.  Piece of garbage.	-1
Almost started on fire with a 30 amp fuse, fuse finally blew, but the spade connectors attached to the 10 gauge wire is sub par causing whole unit to heat up and melt down. I only had a 21 amp load on this product and it failed miserably when it got too hot and resistance climbed so high that the total amperage was too much and caused it to fail. Btw, this unit came with a 40 amp fuse from factory. This should easily been able to hand a sustained load of 21 amps.	-1
As previously reviewed its not 10awg more like something between 14 and 12. Fuses were in packet but I will use my own	-1
the photo shows a length of wire exposed and tinned it also shows a fuse i received a loop without a fuse. the fuse i could care less about but the length of wire was very short and i could barley work with it.	-1
ok	-1
This product did not seem to be the gauge they promised.  I was going to replace a 12 gauge fuse block with this since it was supposed to be 10 gauge wire, but  appears to be even smaller than the one I'm using now.  It does use a 10 amp fuse, but so did the other.  If all you need is lower protection then for the price you can't beat this.  Solar panels hooked up to motor home batter I would not trust this setup.	-1
seems to be ok . but I used it with # 10 superworm wire and it is not as big around . ( so it may not be a true # 10 wire )	-1
20 weeks and no product	-1
item is of poor quality. Would not order it again.	-1
Item description said 10AWG wire fuse holder. Received 16AGW(as stated on wire) fuse holder. Waited 3 weeks for shipping, only to find you do not get what you order. Of course the mistake is ALWAYS a cheaper/inferior product.	-1
First thing, I didn't realize is that this item was coming direct from China.  So if you need this part soon, go to an auto parts store and pay a couple bucks more.  From there it goes all downhill.  I'm not even going to waste my time using the part.  When I opened that fuse holder, which may or may not be waterproof, the connectors are not lined up.  One connector is easily visible, and tight against one side, and the other is covered/filled with rubber, and offset against the other side.  I am thinking that once I clean the rubber out of the one side of the connector, I would have to bend the legs on the fuse, one forward, with a twist, and one backwards with a twist in the opposite direction just to get it to fit in the holder.  I guess I could risk that everything else encased in the rubber wasn't going to short out and burn my $40,000 truck to the ground, but I'm pretty sure this item will be much safer if I install it in the nearest trash can.  This item is pure junk, and from the workmanship, or lack there of, I would highly recommend everyone steer clear of this item.  Notice the enclosed picture.  This is just as I received the item.	-1
Wired the Jack Assembly into my boat correctly (yes I know how to do complete auto/marine/house wiring).  I received 12v at the Jack but the included Cigarette Lighter would not work at all!  I'm not sure if the Jack Assembly was defective (clips that hold the Lighter in when pressed).  Or if the Lighter it's self was defective.  Anyways after wasting my time, I guess it's RMA for this one and driving down to the auto parts or junk yard.  Done...	-1
I put this back together after getting it, but noticed the bad quality in the stamping which placed the +/- contacts in the socket almost touching. BAD and CROOKED metal parts in it, not bent, just totally bungled stampings of the parts. Not safe at any volts.	-1
I thought all of these were a standard size, but apparently not because it does not fit in my Jeep Commander. So it may work fine in other vehicles, you'd have to take a chance and find out.	-1
I knew this wasn't exactly OEM quality, but it should have lasted a year or two! Better luck in the junk yard I suppose!	-1
Updated review, and it's bad.  I had an initial review of good on this item regarding it's construction until I tried to solder the leads to some copper wire. The material used in these fuse leads is some sort of extremely inferior copper or "copper-like" metal and is impossible to solder under any circumstances. I found out the hard way and after the fact. The only chance you will have to incorporate this fuse to a device is by wire nuts or by solderless crimp connectors. And the way the so called stranded wire resisted being soldered and turned black and charred gets me to thinking that there could be some serious resistance going on and a resultant undesirable voltage drop or intermittent issues. I don't think I'm going to trust it to my vintage 2-way transceiver and I would highly recommend anyone NOT to buy nor utilize this product. It's only $2.64 with shipping for a reason. Don't do it.	-1
Product features, and imprinting on the device itself, stated that it has a twist-lock feature. One would imagine that meant there was a way that after it was inserted into the power port, that you could twist something, causing it to lock securely in place.  This power port adapter (they used to call them cigarette lighter plugs) is just like any other. There is NOTHING about this unit that makes it any more secure than any other. There is nothing to twist, no locking mechanism of any type. It's simply the same spring tension found on all power port adapters.  Nor is it marine grade. In order for it to be 'marine grade' it would have to be made of corrosion resistant materials and be at least water resistant. Not so with this unit. It's made of the same plastics and inexpensive metals as any other. Get it wet, it will rust. Submerse it, it will fill with water, instantly and fail.  So, this is a flagrant case of product misrepresntation. I would not buy it again. In fact, if I had the power, I'd make the company stop selling it, buy back what they had already sold, and sue them for false advertising.	-1
i do not understand this fuse holder.  the pins inside are out of alignment.  i doubt a fuse can actually go into it.  i suspect someone wasn't paying attention.	-1
Nothing marine grade or locking about this plug.  Overpriced and deceptive title!  Go buy one from any other cheap source and you'll get one just as good... if not better!	-1
I threw it away, it was an absolute pain trying to wire this thing, look for a socket with lead lines! The thing is also not waterproof, it is split in half and does not seal.	-1
Doesn't work too well on ATV...disengages often	-1
super cheap wire. it smells like plastic and is all sticky.... would not order again.	-1
Product not as described. They send me a broken magnet!	-1
Ordered because it is supposed to be 10 AWG. But it is actually 12 AWG. Dissapointed as I already had 12 AWG fuse holder.	-1
They may not all be like this but I received one that would not allow the current to pass thru the fuse block. I'm guessing it came in soldered or something. Had to trash it and buy a different one. Yes I checked the fuse, even replaced it, still no worky.	-1
no fuse like the other reviewer said...then the wire has to be cut somehow.  I don't have that tool.  very cheap.	-1
I would have rated this item higher if I got a 10 gauge fuse holder. I ended up NOT using these in-line fuses due to their wire gauge size. I REALLY needed 10 ga NOT 6-8ga as these appear to be. I even compared them with my 14ga and 10ga wires. I will probably end up storing these or throwing them out. Again, if they were the right wire gauge, I would have given at least four stars. :(  UPDATE:  I contacted company and they were quick to respond. They apologized for any misunderstanding and sounded like they wanted to set things straight. Although they said they sent me the correct 10gauge holders, the sizes are larger than those at my local store. However, they were professional and offered to replace them for free with 12/14 gauge wires. I may be skeptical about the actual  wire gauge size but am very pleased with the companies professional demeanor. :)	-1
I ordered the same fuse holder back in April and received good quality products and the fuse holder even came with a 40 amp fuse. I reordered 2 more but his time the fuse holder is very poor quality and no fuses included. I can live without the fuses but the holder is junk. Not worth the bother to return.	-1
I ordered 2 different ones from the same seller with different wire sizes and got 2 of the same wire sizes; both were larger size (smaller guage) so it will work, but it would have been nice to have gotten what I ordered.	-1
Unit has a dead short between the two AC connectors	-1
I thought this would be a great wax but it leaves large water dropletts on the car surface. Don't have a garage so after the rains or early morning dew now you have large water spots to deal with	-1
Juste a Regular spunch !) no more than 2$	-1
I've been using Klasse for about 10 years based on the recommendation of a car upholsterer.  However, when I opened this bottle I was surprised the liquid was milky white, instead of clear like the bottle that just went empty.  I used it on my car, but I am highly suspicious, as it is NOT THE SAME KLASSE.  If this is the new formula, I will search for a new leather cleaner/conditioner solution.	-1
Hi this formula was changed and this new stuff is junk ..would love my money back...not impressed at all...that's all.junk..	-1
Don't see anything special about this enough to cost it's high price.	-1
Nice but painfully to fully wipe off without the product showing it was applied. I typically have to wash or wax the car to remove the product. Not a bad thing but it is 2 times the work. The product is fantastic.	-1
Two stars is a generous rating for this product.  Followed directions to apply the product.  Resulted in swirls, lackluster shine.  Was so disappointed went out and purchased a competitors product (Mother's synthetic wax).  Results with Mother's was light years ahead of Klasse.  Klasse was difficult to tell if it was covering as you need to apply it thin per directions.  Difficult to tell when dry.  Difficult to impossible to get the marks out it would leave.  It may last a long time, but then who would want a crappy shine on for that long?  Save yourself $25 and several hours of headache and go with another brand.	-1
the worst product that i have tried....leave swirls all over on dark colored cars. please do yourself a favor and not base on these reviews and stay away you will thank me at the end. been using all type of wax and sealant, found mothers product to be the best.	-1
I got this for my motorhome because they say it will last a year before you need to do again. Well they might be right,because it is really hard to get it off. Even tried with my car polisher but the only way to get it all off was to put Nu finish and they use car polisher and that did work. Save time and money just buy Nu Finish.  Still think it is junk. Used it on my motorcycle last night and did it three times in a row. Not slick at all. My Nu finish did a lot better job. Save your money just get Nu Finish for $6.00	-1
I got this at a good price when Autogeek had their last Black Friday sale. I was excited to try this "Show Wax" that everyone raves about. It is soft and buttery, and goes on ridiculously easy and allows you to remove immediately. However, like another reviewer, I find that this attracts dust like CRAZY. After a few hours, my car was literally covered in a film of it. I haven't had this happen with other waxes such as Meguiar's Ultimate Paste Wax. On top of that, it doesn't even look different from other waxes/sealants that are 1/3 the cost. so it's just not worth the money. However, it does get one extra star for the easy application.  There are two types of detailing fanatics, those who believe that prep work is all you need for a car to pop and that a sealant/wax simply offers protection, and those who believe that you also need a high quality wax to achieve the perfect shine. After trying this, I find myself in the former category.	-1
I have wanted to try Pinnacle Wax on my classic car for more than a month. I emailed the company 6 times so far with a product specific question so that I buy the right Pinnacle Wax. Their product may very well be very good, but their customer service is TERRIBLE. I have emailed them 6 times so far, and they have not had the courtesy to answer even one of my emails. I was really looking forward to see if their waxes were as good as some people claim. For, bar-none, the single most expensive car wax that I have found on the market you would think that they would at least put some priority on their customers, sadly they do not! They apparently want to just sit back and take your money. I have been happy with the wax I have been using, but wanted to try theirs to see if I would notice a difference in either shine or longevity.	-1
This is a very old, touchy product and must be installed thin, must be installed in optimal weather conditions, in the shade and needs to be wiped off quickly.  I have never been able to make it work better than more modern alternates such as McKee's, Meguiers, Sonax and Collinite.  Beware of these conditions and you may have good success.	-1
Less effective than regular soap and water at removing tree sap...	-1
Didn't do much for a decent amount of tar/oil from road construction. Doesn't dissolve/knock it out nearly as well as I would have thought. I won't be buying this again or recommending it to anyone.	-1
worked ok, smeared , seemed to loosen some , can empties fast	-1
Doesn't work on tar at all. It will get sticker glue off like a boss.	-1
Yup, didn't remove the dried sap off my cars. I kept reapplying it till the can ran empty, nothing happened.  Update, I found hand sanitizer (or rubbing alcohol) works fantastically. After posting this review I went on YouTube hoping for something that would compare which products worked best. I found Chris Fix, he used all the off the shelf stuff, homemade, and hand sanitizer,  etc. I spent an hour on the two cars and it got off the road tar, bugs, and lots of tree sap without hurting the paint.	-1
this company had a great bug and tar removing product in the past.the liquid wasn't clear like this one. I don't know why they changed it to a spray. this product is horrible. i nearly rubbed the skin off my fingers trying to take out the bug stains.!!!!!!!	-1
Great name...does not live up to it.  I hate those spots of black road tar that cling to the lower panels, they are thrown up by the wheels and stick to the paint, you know those right? Well I heard good things about this on a car forum so I got some. I used it as directed and it did not take off very much of those spots.  so I reapplied as directed, that helped but it still didn't get all the spots.  I tried reapplying and letting it soak and then more scrubing, still the stubbornest spots were not affected. I then soaked them in household cleaner like ZEP or Simple Green and scrubbed, followed that with Clay Bar.  I think Turtle wax bug and tar remover is a little better but, I still have not found anything that is really good for road tar.	-1
Tarminator will remove tar, and much more if you let it. The directions say it is safe on paint and clearcoat, but it is not to be used on bare plastics (trim mouldings, headlights, etc).  The passenger side of my car was coated with tar from road construction, so I bought some Tarminator to remove it.  On the fenders and doors, the tar was remove with no problems. However when used on my side skirts, which are painted and clearcoated, it started to melt them.  Be careful when using this stuff on any kind of plastic whether painted or not.	-1
Contains petroleum distallates. Careful with light colored leathers. Better experience w Zymol leather conditioners.  Safer.	-1
I had hoped this would be more like Lexol in paste form. Alas, no. It is very waxy, yet "wet" enough to discolor tan leathers. Plus, it's "leather-feeding" effects don'y seem to last very long. Also, the whitish wax component builds up in stitching and looks unsightly.	-1
The instructions did not state the proper application of this product. I panicked when I could not remove it after applying it. I got a bottle of my Meguiars Final Inspection Detailer, added it to my microfiber towel and was able to remove it. Reading these reviews, it makes the product seem worthy, however, I am not going to try it again anytime soon.	-1
No better than garden variety wheel cleaner I've used	-1
Don't know what the hype is all about with this product. This small bottle is enough to maybe do 5 cars or so however it doesn't even clean that good. I would try it using 2 different methods. I would spray it directly onto my dry wheels with slight brake dust build up. I go around to all 4 wheels and spray it on evenly. When I get back to the 1st wheel I applied it on I take a water hose and spray the wheel and the brake dust still stays on the wheels. The second method I rinse each wheel to get it wet than I go around and spray each wheel with this gel wheel cleaner and rinse it off with water when I get back to the first wheel. Still nothing. I always end up resorting to using car wash soap + a wheel sponge to get the job done. This is a complete waste of $20 for a fancy product that is only enough for MAYBE 5 cars?	-1
I bought this product because of all the good reviews. In the past I have used most of the brands from pepboys and decided to try sonex and P21S.  This product did not surpass any other wheel cleaner. IMO when I used car soap and water to clean the wheels they come out just as good..... I am looking for the product that can clean the heavy sticky deposit i get when i go tracking on my Evo x..... so far I have not found something that works  Sonex full effect - very cool and turns purple but still expensive and over hype but cant get the tough black dots off the rims P21S - Gel seems more concentrated then what u can buy at pepboys but still cant get the tough black dots off the rims Car soap - still the cheapest way to clean with a sponge.  I gave it 2 stars because If i clean 4 wheels , 2 with just car soap and 2 with just P21S ... i bet you couldn't tell which one is which. they come out just as clean .... so why am i spending 20 dollars a bottle for ....	-1
Does not fit the window in our 2008 Prius at all. In fact the left side of the shade is considerable taller than the right. Not sure who was in charge of quality control the day they made ours, but they must have been drunk.  It does seem to be made of quality materials, but what does that matter when it can't be used due to the incorrect size?  The shade is also far too bulky when rolled up. Not a problem if you don't ever plan on having people ride in your back seat or if you don't mind storing it in the hatch and getting it out of there whenever you park or don't mind taking it down and storing it back there when you leave.  All in all this thing gets an F from me. I honestly can't get over how poorly it fits.	-1
Mislead poor product.	-1
don't waste yur mony :) (yes i deliberately misspelled da words!)  I use Totally Awesome All Purpose Cleaner found at most dollar stores with better results.  on the bright side this caustic cleaner smells nice (while lungs suffer)	-1
Piece of garbage. I liked it when it was functioning, but today, after only two months of use the screen went completely black.	-1

I actually bought mine last July, and didn't get a chance to write a review until now.  Right out of the box, without the probes attached to anything, the unit gave me very weird readings.  It would display random numbers and constantly jump around, along with a warning message telling me to install the probes, even though they were already plugged in.  Messed around for 20 minutes trying to test the tester (!), and it wouldn't take any readings in any mode, or recognize the testing leads, even if they were definitly making contact.  Of course, I at first suspected that it suffered from a terminal case of being "Chinese junk manufactured from toxic garbage by slave labor."  But just as I was about to submit an Amazon review complaining about having wasted $50 and half an hour of my time (without even beginning to fix the car), I placed the probes on my fingertips and had second thoughts.  This thing was reading that I was producing pulses of current up to 70 amps!  Of course it was unable to take a reading, it was simply confused by being in the presence of the mighty ELECTRO!  Yeah.  So I tested my current and voltage a few times, and according to the meter, I was pulsing something like a 100 volts at 75 amps (seriously, not kidding).  So I thought to myself, "how can I use my amazing powers for the betterment of my fellow man."  Then I thought about my income tax bill this year, and I thought, "how can I use these powers to make daddy some money."  Of course, I'm no fool, so I first tested my powers first on the dog, who was immediately stunned when I touched him.  He's 90 lbs and fell right asleep when I placed my hand on his head, so my powers checked out and I was good to go.  I'd like to say it took an actual superhero to stop my cunning plan, but in fact, it was really just two overweight security guys out in front of the Federal Reserve vault in Lower Manhattan.  Yup, I laid my ELECTRO HANDS! on one of them (while of course, proclaiming that I was applying "ELECTRO HANDS!"), but instead of being stunned or knocked out, he tased me.  I came to about halfway through the beating, and I swear that one of them had a camera phone out and was begging me to say "ELECTRO HANDS!" again, but the doctors convinced me that was just a side effect of being tased multiple times and the skull injuries I sustained while unconsciously resisting arrest.  And no, it is not ironic that they tased me.  That's a standard police practice.  Anywho, I vowed that when I got out of the hospital, I would write a review on this faulty meter, and issue a warning to those of you who would otherwise follow me down the dark path I found myself on.  Be cool, stay in school.  And don't believe what a volt meter produced by a starving child in China for $.015 cents tells you about your body's ability to shock others into submission.  (Or just buy a taser instead.  Those things work wicked good.)	-1
Bought this in 2010, basically on the basis of good reviews, primarily for automotive work. The unit I received was not operable and I returned it. The replacement unit worked about half a dozen times (which for me is a year of use) before also dying, while still on its first battery. Nothing really caused the death; it worked when I put it in the drawer, and not when I took it out a few months later. It still looks brand new.  Anyway.... there are better VOMs out there for under $10.	-1
So the first one arrives and the continuity position will not sound the buzzer.  Of course Amazon is great, and I send it back and they send out a replacement immediately.  Thanks Amazon.  The second unit works correctly in all positions.  The alligator clips suck.  They tend to slide off the probe tips too easily, and they don't readily clamp well to anything.  Something cheap about the size or insulation.  I can't put my finger on it, but I'm pretty sure a tester from Fluke wouldn't have these issues.  It would cost 4x as much too.  I hooked it up to my '74 Cruiser with a straight six and immediately noted that my dwell angle was only 18.  It's supposed to be about 40.  Much better than using a feeler gauge and hoping for the best.  With the dwell set I flipped the knob to the RPM scale and noted that I was idling at 1600... way too fast.  Okey dokey.  Now it's time to check the timing with my trusty timing light then work on the carb with my dial vacuum gauge.  But despite the sucky connectors I'm pretty happy with the unit for as often as I'll be using it.  Oh, and the ohm and voltage readings all seem to be what you would expect.	-1
Two functions (rpm and dwell ) do not work.  I could return it but that will cost me.  So I shall keep it around the shop and use as a DMM.	-1
Did not work for my autometer water temp gauge. Thread pitch was not the right size for a subaru.	-1
This box is NOT weatherproof. There is NO welding of the floor of this box to it's side walls. I can see day light all away around the inside of this box. The brackets are made of PLASTIC. The lid is very flimsy and does not seem to me to be very secure. I am sending this box back. There is no way I would put this in my truck. Your better off locking your stuff up in the cab of your truck.	-1
After 1 week a chip fell out of the top corner. The mirror is not sturdy at all! I have to adjust it every morning on my way to work, then re adjust it on my way home. This mirror SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Cheap construction.  Vibrates while driving.  If you try to tighten the mirror the cheap pot metal bolt breaks.  Yes, the bolt is made of pot metal. Mirror surface is wavy.  A far cry from factory quality.	-1
bulb blew in less than a week	-1
Item description specifies German-made bulb, was shipped bulb made in India.  Not the same quality, returned for refund without even installing the bulb.	-1
I live in Ecuador that hurts in the cover image appears with the cable and connector ready to connect-but only when I get my disappointment I was sent another totally different without the cable or terminal allegedly saw in the picture and live in Ecuador as I get more expensive forwarding for change. Soon I'll put photos of the wrong product.	-1
not sure if these were some Chinese crap someone put in a Hella box but absolutely no brighter than 55 Watt bulbs. would waste your time if you want brighter bulbs.	-1
ordered a few and they burn out rather quickly. Seem to last 2-4 weeks and thats it.	-1
Burnt out in a month...	-1
Poorly designed Ball Swivel Socket for mirror adjustment. Tried 2 of these mirrors on my ATV. The swivel socket broke out of the plastic back on the 1st. The second wobbles and does not hold the mirror steady. If the Swivel adjust mechanism was made more like the 48502 looks, it would probably be much better. The clamp-on piece is good, but overall rating is one star. I wouldn't buy it again!	-1
No matter how I tighten the screw attachment a slight bump or a gust of wind dislodges this mirror. A permanent glue or screw attachment is probably better.	-1
My order was fulfilled by USA Deals Store. My lights arrived and they were not a kit, but two separate lamps in boxes that were sloppily taped and appear to be repackaged. The boxes said "Made in India". I opened the packages, removed the old headlights from my 2001 Jeep Wrangler,  and installed one of the new lights. It was very loose in the housing. I removed it to see why it was so loose and couldn't see anything wrong. Measuring the old lamp and comparing it to the new one, I found that the lip that sits in the ring is 4-5 mm thinner on the new lamp and there isn't any way that the ring is going to tighten on the new lamp. I am not sure if these lamps are for a different application, but they were not a direct replacement for me.	-1
Won't stay on	-1
Keeps jumping off the top rail of my windshield.  Everything about the mount is slick and slippery.  The mirror itself is nice, but the mounting system sucks.	-1
Not very bright. Works good in fog. Bulbs need to be upgraded to 100 watt.	-1
Bought these to go with some board ramps I intended to use to load a riding mower onto a 3/4 ton pick-up.  Turns out to meet the angle I would need to get the mower on the truck, the boards would have to be too long and wouldn't support the mower's weight.  As a result, these suckers went back and I bought premanufactured aluminum ramps.  Much better and safer, I think.	-1
Good news: It worked great.  The single eye (instead of a loop) fit perfectly through small openings, lock worked without a problem, and the weatherproof cable was the length needed . Bad news: Without using any force at all (tugging, pulling, stretching, yanking, et. Cetera), within less than two days the loop came out (see pics).  After stuffing the cord back into the black anchor and crimping it down using a bench vise, the loop is now securely back in the black anchor.  Set aside that the black anchor now looks like crap, the entire problem implies no "pride of workmanship" and a low quality product.	-1
The lock is sharp and is uncomfortable to handle.  The key is tinier than the tip of your index finger.  I almost lost one already.  Because the key is so tiny it makes unlocking this difficult.  I much prefer the master lock key and cable.	-1
Pros It did give a more focused ray of beam i needed for my motorcycle.  Cont It does not have a diagram to show how its mounted or the mounting points, having you to believe they are uniform which they are not. After buying it, i realise i had to make major modifications which I did. These modification has it limitations. The biggest con was the harness melted because there wasn't enough feature for venting.	-1
When I received this part, several components were missing in accordance with the picture displayed on Amazon.  I only received the 3 wire Sending Unit so I returned this item back to Amazon.  I haven't received my refund yet and its been awhile.	-1
The installed easily, light output is real nice but they have moisture inside them. I have owned them less than a few months and both have moisture inside them. Dont waste your money. I live in a rainy climate.	-1
I would not trust these at all for over 200lb	-1
I honestly can't tell anyone that I noticed a significant difference, at least not enough to justify spending the amount of money it costs.	-1
I have hella rallye 1000 lights and I wanted to upgrade the power output. I read the reviews and a few complaints existed about it being made in korea and I don't have a problem with korean made products so I went ahead and ordered two. The bulbs were built good, nothing was lose as another review suggested and I began installation. These would not fit! Upon closer examination, the tabs that are the side are not made to the correct specification. The side with the rectangular opening is not only too small, but it does not have the depth for the circular opening to fit it's place. I have genuine hella lights(housings), and I went with hella bulbs expecting the same great quality. Both bulbs suffered from this problem. I'm not sure if Hella has given the wrong specifications, or if the factory has poor quality control, or if hella is just buying  s***ty bulbs from a whole saler.  Others seem to have had better luck, if you plan on buying these be ready to run into some trouble though I hope you dont.	-1
The Hella 1000 Black Magic lights take a 55 watt H2 bulb. Caution: the 100 watt H2 bulb has different hole/notch spacing (wider) than the H2 55 watt bulbs and if using on a light that is made for a 55 watt H2, you'll need to modify the bulb mount or the light reciever to fit. The 100 watt H2 bulbs WILL NOT fit the Hella 1000 Black Magic lights without modification.	-1
Installation instructions were good and easy to follow.  However, lights made almost no noticeable difference when operated with my halogen sealed beam high beams.  Now holes have been drilled and they have been mounted and I won't remove them but, just a word of advice; don't expect them to provide any improvement over your properly aimed high beams.  These are not fog lights.  I ordered "Driving Lights" to improve my long range visibility at night. I have a lot of deer that are active at night and are often on the road I take to work.  Many near misses and these wimpy driving lights won't help.  Not recommended.	-1
I want to state that I really like Hella products.  However, I am VERY disappointed with these lamps.  I realize these are compacts, however the reflector fails to put the light where it needs to be.  It more or less scatters the light all over the place almost like a flood.  I think I'm going to try a set of Hella projector style next time if size is an issue for me.	-1
These are not the extreme white bulbs (blue), they are clear glass with no color. Not what I expected!	-1
They say it's extreme white piaa but the bulb looks the same except the glass is a different color and it lights up as a different color compared to the original piaa light.	-1
I used standard 55 watt bulbs in my 500s and these caused the lenses to crack from the heat that couldn't escape. Yeah, they protect the lenses from rocks, but what good is that if the lenses crack anyway?	-1
These produce a wide fan shaped beam of light that does a great job illuminating the area just in front of the vehicle and well into the sides of the road.  The color is a crisp bright yellow when even just using the stock 55w bulbs.  They may seem too large for some cars, but on my rather rectilinear Volvo they look right at home.  I never travel at night without them and do a great job letting me see pedestrians and other hazards on the sides of the road.  Their color also helps reduce back dazzle with all the snow we've had in Central Massachusetts this year.  *Update 10/28.2015:  Downgraded from 4 to 2 stars.  I've been running these for about 10 months now.  Even with Hella screen protectors,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/HELLA-Clear-Stone-Shield-for-550-Series-Lamp/dp/B000H0KN9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HELLA Clear Stone Shield for 550 Series Lamp</a>&nbsp;These still cracked.  I'm a conscientious driver and I've never struck anything, but both lamps have what appear to be stress cracks.  These are mounted pendant fashion below my bumper.  Not sure how or why this happened.  Also both lamp's bulb retainers are not up to the task.  They are sloppily made and don't really lock into place.  The metal is also not up to the task as they don't provide adequate grounding for the bulbs and are badly oxidizing.  Both ground wires are grounded to the metal bumper which is likewise grounded to the car's chassis.  I expected much more from Hella over this.  I think I'll need to look for Cibi brand from now on.  Additionally, I think I'd prefer the more classic amber/gold color lamps from "back in the day" over these brighter more "lemon yellow" colors.  But alas, the EPA doesn't want us using cadmium to color the glass and longer.	-1
not as seen	-1
could not mount where it needed to be	-1
I got these because I thought it would be nice to have brighter back up bulbs, but because they are blue they really darken the light housing and make it look well....blue. More than I anticipated they would. Then I tried them in the red brake light side and even there it darkened it to a ruby red that looked funny because of the blue color. They are nice and bright when working, but unless your looking for a blue lens housing look, stick with a clear/amber/chrome bulb. Also, pretty pricy for a small simple bulb.	-1
way bigger then expected, price was for qty 1	-1
I was very excited to upgrade my OEM brake/parking in my vehicle.  After changing one bulb at a time and viewing the image on my white garage door, I determined that I was mislead with this purchase.  Sure, this bulb has more wattage than the OEM (5/21 Watt) with the PIAA at (8/27 Watt).  The bulb is covered deeply with blue paint and although it illuminates a whiter color, is is not as bright as the OEM bulb, thus a waste of money.  I would not recommend this product.	-1
Didn't expect the paint to discolor and flake away before the engine even reached operating temperature.	-1
This muffler didn't make any sound difference and didn't increase horse power like it says.. Rusts too.	-1
I was replacing a broken hitch brake light identical to the one pictured. Like other customers, I received a light that was different than the item pictured...it had a smaller ram's head and the word "RAM" at the bottom. I own a Ram 1500 and I thought it still looked OK, so I kept it. Though I believe that I prefer the item pictured.  Update: DO NOT BUY!! On 5/27/13 I noticed that this hitch brake light no longer worked. When I pulled off the cover to replace the bulb, I discovered that the bulb had generated so much heat that it melted the gasket behind the cover and also partially melted the black plastic housing. Not only did the heat from the bulb destroy this item after about a year and half, but I believe that it could potentially create an unsafe condition by melting parts of it. DO NOT BUY!!	-1
not as described don't wast your time	-1
Product tore off the truck after one trip down a dirt road. Now my camper has excessive damage. I do not recommend this product for anyone planning to use them for the intended purpose. If you plan to use them just for looks, might be the cheap product you need (if you dpnt lose them on the highway)	-1
I use this on mi tacoma 05, in a week end trip with much mud.. the 4 screws and washer per side, was the only thing that was left.. would not buy it again...	-1
They seem adequate for the price. My only disappointment was that "all hardware included" means they come with 6 screws. I was hoping for some sort of bracket but I'm sure I can improvise something.	-1
Rubber mounting points on both guard riped within a matter of weeks (during which time I barely even used the vehicle) and required me to clamp them back to the hanger using large washers each size. this are by no means a quality product.	-1
Received Product with scratches	-1
It's not very bright. I don't really like it, but it fills the hitch hole, and it's Chevy, so it's cool.	-1
Don't waste your money. Buy the four prong version. It's more money but worth it.	-1
It looks nice but it flashes when I have my right turn signal on.  I would change my review to 5 stars if someone could tell me why it does this.  I have a new truck and the trailer lights all work as the should but when this is plugged in it works with Breaks and right turn signal.	-1

Ordered this for my new Honda.  The frame does not fit my license plate. It sits on top of the plate and the edges of the plate show from behind. I'm hoping I simply got a defective frame because if I didn't, this is terrible design.  Returned.	-1
Be aware that I have only had this plate on my brand new f250 for a week and a half and yesterday I looked at the front of the truck and found that this cheap piece of crap had lost one of its ford logos. Just cheap double back tape on the back of the logo.  The other one is coming off also. Junk!	-1
Hole does not match hole in receiver.  Can't use it.	-1
Have to send out a warning for this item.  This light started a fire that would of burned down my car if I wasn't there to see it happening. I have a 2014 jeep jk and this was attached to my hitch and wired into my brake lights using the fasteners and wiring that came with it. I did not use anyother wires or alter in anyway. Problem was I backed into a parking spot and unbeknownst to me there was a 2 foot high retaining wall at the back of the parking spot. I hit the wall, not hard but enough to feel the jolt,  with my hitch receiving all of the impact. My hitch extends 6 inches from the bumper because of the rear spare tire. Luckily I stayed in the car and called a friend and while speaking on the phone , about thee minutes later, I see smoke in my rear view mirror. At first I thought it was water that hit my tail pipe or water in the parking spot that I backed into. Sooin the smoke became dark and covered my rear window. I hung up, jumped out and saw a fire coming from my hitch. The plastic was on fire extending inside the hitch with the fire coming out of the hitch hitting my rear spare tire. I have a cloth cover on my spare so now I'm panicking thinking its going to catch fire as well. I started blowing on it, kicking it with my foot and than grabbed a bottle of water that I had and poured it on it . I got the fire down enough so that I could blow out the rest. The wires that connected from the light to the brake lights were on fire as well.  I blew that out and disconnected everything. The plastic burned to half its size.  I'm very lucky because if I wasn't sitting there on the phone, I would of left and the car would of been on fire. I'm very lucky and can't recommend this product. Any accident or if you get rearended could start this on fire.	-1
The plug wire has no where to go item was sent back I used a cap instead	-1
Renegade owners beware, this hitch cover works but causes a code for trailer lights out to show up on dashboard, it also caused my left directional to blink really fast as if it was out too.. if this didn't happen I would give it 5 stars.. if this company makes this for jeeps it would be nice if it worked right for all models	-1
thank you very much for the product is much to my liking, thanks.	-1
Does not work, contact me for replacement details and i will give you a perfect rating. People make mistakes but it is how they fix their mistakes that keeps me coming back.	-1
The light doesn't work even when I rewired it. I thougt it was the bulb that was bad, but it wasn't.	-1
After using this three times, it's worn out.  The zipper gets stuck and the stitching is unraveling, and the straps are tearing out of the top of the bag, leaving holes for water to get in.  I'm not impressed.	-1
I bought this frame from a local automotive store. A year later the black is coming off, the chrome looks oxidized, and it just looks plain awful. I'm never buying a license plate frame again. It was a total waste of money.	-1
Don't buy cord is too short	-1
I have gone through thirteen bulbs in two years. Yes, thirteen. They are installed in a stock 2003 Volvo S-40 sedan, by the dealer! They look great for about a month or so, then they blow. And blow, and blow. The manufacture PIAA sucks big time, they allowed me two replacements. Get anything but these bulbs, unless your Daddy owns the factory!!!!	-1
This is one of those things where you get what you pay for. I know I shouldn't complain but I'm not really. If you want this go to Walmart. At least they are built better.	-1
UPDATED: Well, this device does NOT work on my 2015 F-150 truck with backup sensors, camera and/or trailer brake controls.  Upon starting my truck, I got dash displayed messages that a trailer was connected; that the back-up assist was disabled and that there was a left turn signal fault.  Removed this lighted hitch, and all back to normal.  For 2015 F-150s, the wiring just barely reaches the connector being fully stretched to get there. And the retaining hole positions the back plate about 1" outside the truck trailer hitch adapter. I connected and it worked when just pressing the brake pedal, but failed when starting the engine. Will give this to someone with a truck not having the newer electronic features. I doubt any lighted hitch covers will work on newer trucks with any of the advanced or trailering features.	-1
Bought this thinking it would be a quick and easy install. But you have to buy a hitch light install kit, which costs twice as much as this product. Still haven't used it, not sure if it works.	-1
Lightweight plastic explains the price.  Not terribly bright but the real problem is that the hole for the pin is 1/2 inch off and is not tight to the hitch body and rattles around,  I am thinking of returning it.  Also,  why didn't they wrap all the wire in black, looks tacky the way it is exposed white wire.	-1
Over priced for brightness	-1
Spend the extra $5 or $10 and get the better one.  First thing that happened was the ratcheting system give and that was only after the first day.	-1
Assembly makes bar feel loose when in place. They need to make another position fine adjustment for that in between adjustment.	-1
Did fit for 2010 bmw 328i xdrive angel eyes	-1
I had to send this item back for two reasons. 1) the light did not light up and 2) It did not fit as stated. Sorry! In addition, I did not like the plastic make up of the hitch either.	-1
3 month lifespan with norma use	-1
I bought these to replace my stock bulbs and to be honest they were the same as far as light output. I will be putting my LED bulbs back in until I can find something that is brighter and/or better. These unfortunately go in the trash.	-1
Only works when braking	-1
Ordered these thinking they would be improved bulbs for the 2010 Wrangler. One burned out in 4 months! I expected much better quality from this brand and for the price I paid.	-1
Same exact color as my stock bulbs...	-1
Xtreme White??? I would call them Xtreme Disappointing... The only white thing they have is the box, don't waste your money on this bulbs. I'll return them.	-1
Great high quality Halogen replacement, but not very white, which was the reason I bought these. Now I have expensive spares.	-1
They fell apart  junk	-1
After installing this kit, the lights stay on regardless of whether the switch is on 'ON' or 'OFF' position.  After trouble shooting for an afternoon, I believe the issue lies within the relay.  I would have considered exchanging this for another one, but after a trip to Auto-zone I was able to piece together a functioning switch for almost half the cost.  Were the switch in working condition, the kit would have been somewhat worth the cost.  It does come with most everything you need to complete an install, the only thing missing are a few of the bullet style wire connectors to connect to the light terminals.  Though this may have just been the type of connectors on my specific fog lights, not that big of an issue since I had some in my garage.  **Also note that if you do not have much electrical experience that you may want to shy away from this kit, assuming you receive one in complete working condition.  The instructions provided are convoluted at best.  I would have expected something a little more thought out from KC.  Good luck	-1
These thinks sucked  they weren't any brighter and some of the cheaper bulbs I would not buy again. I'll stick to sylvania or night hawks. So much hype but that's all it is hype very dissapointed... and they don't last long I had one blow already and it hasn't been a month I always use gloves and make sure not to touch the glass. Crappy product	-1
3 months and one has already blown out! Good light but poor lifespan	-1
I had these bulbs installed for less than year before they burned out. WTF PIAA? Charge that much for a unreliable bulb, first and last time I ever any products form PIAA. I would stay clear of these, I had read reviews where they didn't last long but 11 months for the price is BS! Buy Led, cheaper and long lasting!	-1
I was looking for a DOT approved Driving or Fog to help with driving in NW hwy mountain passes, deer, black ice, ect  Update 2/25 - recommend you to get the Rigid Industries 50481 D-Series SAE Fog Light Set, price is lower on Amazon <$220 also have optional plastic snap yellow and clear cover set at $10. ----------- About Optilux 2020 After reading the reviews below,  I removed the back plates. _Removed the stock failed gasket / RTV= One light assy had gasket not installed correctly and the other had clear RTV lines on the long sides but not on end area. _I replaced the Fog bulb side with a yellow 2500k 55watt bulb. Used gloves cleaned with 91% alcohol to help with bulb life. Nokya H3 JDM Yellow Light Bulbs $16, I have used them before in 5 round flood work lights. _Urethane, Black from H.Depot in a 3ml syringe (no tip or needle) for control and sealed the back and plug wires too. I also replaced the original BHPH screws with SS SHCS JIC.  Note: the lens RTV has a vent area, bottom, center,  long (see picture)  I mounted lights up off the ground to help with the condensation / water issue. I have the option of adding a defector plate in front of vent area to help with road water after final alignment.  The first day it snowed and the lens had condensation in them. I feel its not a good idea to completely seal the lens vent at this time. turn on the light and it goes away quickly.  I did not use the provided wires / fuse / relay or switch, I made a circuit - individual switches for option of Fog and Driver on at same time. My Tech buddy helped with the switch / relay / wire / fuse panel circuit, so I will not be able to help you out on that end.  Did get all the components on Amazon, recommendation for wire order:  UL Approved Marine Grade Tinned Copper Boat Battery Cable Rated 600 Volts - from EWCS - MADE in USA!  I did the rough alignment for beam patterns.  I do not like that the lights are fixed focus and new bulbs can effect this.  Update 2/25/17, condensate is worse now, _I have water droplet inside lens everytime the lights are off / cool down. Weather conditions has been - rain, cold, clear, snow in 55*F to 25*F this month. _Due to the set Focus (no adjustment) of the bulbs position. when I added the yellow bulbs to the Fog Side they are not in line with the driver's bulbs so it's off a little on the high side. Aligned to driver side pattern which is a round beam pattern. _*** folks, I recommend that you don't waste your time or money trying to modify these lights. just go get something else. having two lights in one housing sounds great but ...... _I'll be waiting for these lights to fail and then replace with the Rigid Industries 50481 D-Series SAE (DOT) Fog Light Set and yellow clear snap covers.  The Rigid's were $270 last year and currently are at $220. Will mount on bottom / low side of bumper closer the ground. The Rigid are the best of the best. Made in USA.  Update 5/20/17, 1 bulb failed yesterday. Driver bulb. Note: I did use driving lights everyday, 2 hrs during early mornings. still have heavy condensate inside lens and it has not rained in a week.

Shame on Hella, I have used their products for over 30 years, this set of lights are JUNK. Removed the back plate to install upgraded bulbs (brand new out of the original box) and the O ring seals were not in-place(floating around in the housing). Re-Installed  the O ring seal, mounted the lights, after the first use in a rain storm the Front Lens seals let water into the lights. Think Hella needs to move their factory back to Germany or get the QC folks out of the Chinese break room.	-1
not white at all- very yellowish - complete false advertisement! skip them.	-1
Burned out in two months.	-1
Over priced not very bright, glass lenses are very fragile and not replaceable. In less than a year one bulb is already not working and no longer fuctions and one lense is cracked. This product will be headed for the trash before long.. For what is involved here there must be a high profit margin. Thumbs down, purchasing based on the name Hella will surely leave you disappointed. Look elsewhere.	-1
I installed them on my truck they filled with water with in two days. If you want to get screwed over buy this if you want good light look elsewhere	-1
ok	-1
Very disappointed !! I had a similar set possibly of a different brand installed on an earlier vehicle of mine that were so far superior,the light was far brighter,covered a greater area. I wish I could have remember the brand??? I do quite a bit of night driving and I really need all the light I can get.	-1
Well here we are at the review stage. First off I bought these for lows and highs on my 2007 Honda civic. I really like the color tone, its not yellow by any means. These are mainly a white color with just a tint of blue. The only time you can tell the blue tone is when you are in another car looking back at your headlights dead on. But when driving the lights look white and very bright. The range of these are great, they also make the street signs light up unbelievably well.. even from a far distance.  What I do not like is that I bought these about 14 to 15 months ago and one of them burnt out already on the car. Talk about a disappointment. All I hear about these are supposed to be bright with good color and have a long life. Well these do not have a long life to them. I will not be buying this again for a replacement bulb. For all you Honda Civic owners out there you know how much of a pain it is to replace the headlights on these cars. I am not willing to take the front of my car off or go through the tire well to change out the headlights yearly. Let alone buying these headlights yearly either .. good for them .. not so much for me.  Also I see that the replacement is 1 year, thats super convenient huh.	-1
I have a 2005 Honda Civic, the original head lights lasted 10 years.  I bought these to replace them they only lasted 16 months.  The first one when out on a Friday night, I got to AutoZone as they were closing the door.  Changed it in the parking lot.  Then the second one when out a week later.	-1
FYI, VERY DIM bulb.  This bulb is far dimmer than stock though a tad whiter. It is not LED white, but whiter than a standard bulb. Just very dim.	-1
Received bulb, manufactured in South Korea (in the past Germany) and the mounting base is spot-welded on crooked.  Will ask Amazon for replacement, but not a good sign for QA/QC.  Only needed as a spare, but no less disappointed.	-1
burnt out after 8 days, returned for refund	-1
Item literally BLEW UP in the headlight housing no more than two weeks after I installed it.  There has to be a QA issue (at least with the one I received).  I now have glass fragments all inside the housing and cannot figure out how to get them out without removing the entire housing from the vehicle.	-1
March 24 purchase review: I just installed these in my RSX. After removing the dreaded yellow halogen bulbs from Silverstar that was probably gonna blow out any second now, I replaced it with these. Flipped the light on and BAM! still effin yellow. im jealous, everyone has white light except me LOL. in the dark these are really bright. the videos ive seen demonstrating this on youtube don't do it justice in person. they are very nice. but for the price, i wanted a clean white light, at least something close to clean. its not that much of a difference when compared to the silverstar bulb.  January 25th update review: the drivers side headlight blew. i paid this much for these bulbs that were not even all that white and one side didn't last a year. so i went back to the nasty yellow bulbs. one star. one.	-1
Well that was disappointing. A bulb went out after only 5 months of normal use. The OEM bulb that came with my Honda lasted 8 years! As far as light quality it was nothing out of the ordinary. The fit was good and I had no hassles installing the bulbs.	-1
These both burned out in 9 months. Never had a problem like this before.	-1
Not white at all, for the price you can actually find something better than this, if you want white, then this are not the light bulbs you're looking for	-1
These are nice looking light, but they don't last. I bought these on Sep 11, 2013 and they just died today December 12, 2015. And I paid $ 14 back I. 2013 for them. I used them for my license plate lights. They do look cool.not very bright.	-1
Very dull bulbs did not meet the known expectations I have with piaa products.	-1
Very poor workmanship!	-1
NO hardware included. Deceptive advertising.	-1
Bought a new set of these elsewhere and cannot return them.  They are no better than cheap stock bulbs at the auto parts stores.	-1
Edit: seems some folks are confused at the star rating and irate at my alternative usage and not as a mud flap.  My star rating on these is as a mud flap.  It has no reinforcement at the top and hence would have a short life unless you were to epoxy a metal overlay to it.  Additionally I used one as the floor of a home made feral cat shelter and the cat pretty well destroyed it in a few months.  However they're perfectly fine large, thick rubber pieces with a myriad of uses.  I happened to get a pair from amazon warehouse for <$10, and it fit the bill at that price for several alternative uses.  Original:  I bought these for the same reason as another reviewer: to use in a home made dog door.  I have three very large very old dogs that have trouble navigating a regular dog door, and ones that they can fit through run $700.  So I'm going to use this in a similarly sized wood frame and attach a $20 insulated foam panel to the top of it to fill a sliding glass door.  For this application i think I'm going to have to put a stick on cork sheet on one side.  One side is smooth rubber, the other is rough and bumpy...probably the side intended to go towards the tire.  Doesn't look like it'd be comfortable for a dog nose.  Its also pretty heavy and not very flexible, so I hope I don't have any problems with tail slap as it closes.  Its got several indents in the top to put screws or bolts through.  If I can make it work I'll be looking at about $50 for the door.  Not attractive or easily removed/reinstalled but it'll do the job.	-1
At first I was excited to get a great deal on a great product.  About a week ago I installed and properly adjusted them to work with my headlights and I thought all was well.  Yesterday I washed my car, hand wash mind you, bucket, soapy water, and garden hose...  Well.. when I made my way down towards the lights I noticed they were filled about 1/3 of the way with water.  When I first got the lights I noticed that it didn't look like the seal was all the way around where the lens presses into the housing, but all the lights looked like that.  Including the two I had to send back because they arrived with a shattered lens, so I figured it was intentional since it was consistent across the 6 lights I had seen.  Im convinced now that this is a defect in the workmanship of this product.  If I hadn't spent 8 hours installing and wiring these to perfection, I would already have them off the truck in a box to return.  However, considering my lack of free time, I will probably just use them until they fail.. Im guessing 6 months max if I don't start blowing fuses.  Then find a better replacement.  I could have probably picked up the off-brand walmart lights that look just like these, but do seem to be properly sealed, and gotten better long term results at a cheaper price.  Hella & Amazon, I'm disappointed; for being a big name in lights, these don't stand up to the quality I had come to know.	-1
Bad	-1
Bad	-1
Short lifespan, I only owned the car they were placed on for 10-months and one light failed before then.  Not sure if they produced illumination beyond factory lights.	-1
Don't waste your time.  These are bluish, very ricey and give off less light than OEM yellow incandescents.  Too bad.	-1
Terrible product. These bulbs weren't even as bright as my stock bulbs I've been running for 10 years and they're not even white! Wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. Waste of money!!!	-1
not even close to being white	-1
Please try other brand , they burm very easily , most 8 month durability ! Thanks LuKs	-1
Please try other brand , they burm very easily , most 8 month durability ! Thanks LuKs	-1
Not really worth the money. Looked nice and bright for about 3 months then bulbs blew. Either get the cheap ones or upgrade to HID lights.	-1
Arrived with packaged bulbs not intact banging around. I need a new package asap- as	-1
Returned, one bulb does not work and the the other just fine, not as bright as the pictures shows/ or as I thought. Thanks	-1

They are equal to the normal lights, it was not what I expected.	-1
Suppose to be bright white... But instead look horribly yellow...	-1
didn't impressed me, a cheap brand 100w lights up better than this "hella" 100w	-1
Worked for about 1 hour of use. Replaced with a phillip brand, so far so good.	-1

Super bummed about the bulbs burning out...AGAIN. I've replaced the bulbs in my 520 and 510 series lights now twice in less than a year. And now another bulb has burned out! The bulbs are great when working, but the lifespan is so terrible it earns these a one star rating. For the price and PIAA name these bulbs do not live up to the rugged standard you would expect from PIAA.	-1
does not provide any more light than oem bulb that I replaced, do not spend the money. Next time I will buy the sylvania ultra bulbs.	-1
Wow, these are great. The standard H4 bulbs in my 01 Yamaha FZ1 worked nice. These make it better. The light is white , not blue.  It does shine a little further as it is claimed. But not so far that it cause grief to oncoming drivers.  Amazon said that this product doesn't fit my bike, but the PIAA site said it did. So don't always trust what Amazon says with or won't fit. Double check your sources. Time will tell on how long they last..  Update... they had less than 300 miles on them and one is already dead. I took a chance on these to improve the lighting over the standard halogen. But at the cost of these, I feel they are not worth it. I read the reviews on Silverstars having poor performance. I would grade these as no better.	-1
Using these in PIAA 2100XT lamps with full PIAA wiring, harness and switch.  Am on my third bulb (from both lamps) in less than 1 year.  Not electrical - just bulbs.  Even PIAA's replacement warranty isn't worth the hassle of disassembling a lamp more than once each year.  Unfortunately I can't change lamps to get to a different bulb for the application.  Moving to Hellas.	-1
Not worth the premium price for the H11B versions. As another reviewer stated, the packing on this product isn't as good as other PIAA Xtreme White Plus bulbs (H7 for example). No difference in brightness or color then the OEM bulbs being replaced. The plastic used to turn the bulb and lock into place is brittle and easily broken. Sadly you save your money if you're looking for a good H11B replacement. The PIAA H7 XW+ bulbs purchased at the same time for high beams were exceptionally better in all aspects.	-1
I saw the TV commercial for WeatherTech floor mats and was intrigued by the "custom fit to your vehicle" claims they made.  I went to their website and ordered what was supposed to be mats for my 2004 Lexus IS300.  I paid nearly $100 and basically received a universal set of rubber mats that had to be cut-down with scissors to barely fit in my car.  Even after all the cutting, they still didn't fit quite right.  The worst part was that last night, my accelerator pedal got caught under the mat lip and was stuck in the floored position.  I was going 60mph in a 25mph zone.  I quickly had to throw the car into neutral, slam on my brakes and reach down to dislodge the pedal from the mat.  Had I not done this, I could have seriously injured myself or others.  These mats are coming out of my car immediately and I will never order from their site again.  Not only do I feel ripped-off by their deceptive advertising, but they also just put my life in danger.	-1
It is not custom made. WeatherTech says the same item fits several cars. I wanted to buy the front ones too but no, it is not available. I wish WeatherTech made floormats for all cars...and Amazon carried these...	-1
Start cracking pretty quickly and kinda pricy for a piece of plastic  update 8/16  I've had these on for about a year in warm and cold weather, removing them and putting them back on maybe once a month and they have torn in a few spots. Still functional but I'm not sure for how much longer.  update 1/17  Tried taking one off in freezing temperatures and it snapped in half when trying to pop it off.... Pretty trash plastic but not much you can do about it since there's no after market for these...	-1
Sent older style cover, not the one in the picture display. Really sucks when sellers pull this stunt, not worth effort of shipping back, would order another so I could have a matching pair, but would probably get the new style then! Really wish integrity meant something in America again. Thank God I have money to throw away, thanks so much for making my truck look stupid now, it's awesome!	-1
After I get done doing some modifications to the light I might like it better.  At least the price was right so I don't worry about cutting and drilling for an HID conversion.	-1
Not white at all.. still have tinges of yellow. Would suggest getting a Sirius or Sylvania. Latter more costly.  Sirius link(with my review): http://www.amazon.com/T10-194-Degree-Quality-Instrument/dp/B00LBNL3VK/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1418564805&sr=1-1&keywords=2x+T10+194+White+360+Degree+High+Quality+LED+Wedge+Instrument+Panel  Sylvania link: http://www.amazon.com/Sylvania-2825-Premium-White-LEDriving/dp/B00AIJY2ZM/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1418564882&sr=1-1&keywords=sylvania+white  Bet with my balls the above will look whiter than this cream-colored PIAA.	-1
I have a 2011 Kia Optima.  I replaced one bulb to make a comparison to the stock bulb.  The $35 PIAA bulb was no brighter or whiter than the 3-year-old factory bulb.  The comparison was made after dark, so the lack of improvement was quite obvious.  I am returning the set.	-1
The arm is too short and can not be extended making it difficult to use because my car has a steeply slanted windshield.	-1
it did not work well for me, didn't put out a good light beam pattern, i only use it for like 1 month and gave it to a friend	-1
The suction cup is useless; made out of rigid plastic.  And the visor clip is doesn't provide enough angle to stay in place when the visor is closed.  I would return it, but I let too much time pass and it's just not worth my time.	-1
I remember PIAA's being great back in the day but I was severely disappointed by these. They were no better than stock $2 bulbs. I did a side by side and could not tell the difference day or night. Save your money and go HID or keep your stock bulbs.	-1
I was seeking the whitest, brightest, highest quality bulbs I could find from a reputable brand.  I thought that these were a no brainer.  Sure, they were on the spendy side, however, I figured you can't put a price on your safety and you get what you pay for.  Here's the good news: These were indeed bright.  They were also very white.  I wouldn't say they approached any blue hue that people seek so often, but I think that really can depend on your bulb housing.  My Toyota 4Runner uses a projector style housing.  The main goal I was trying to achieve was getting rid of that yellow look.  Ok, here's the bad news:  After just 6 months, one of my bulbs burnt out.  And at 12 months, the other one went out.  For paying nearly $70, I was incredibly disappointed.  If I paid $20-30 for the set, maybe they'd get a 3 or 4 star rating.... but, I just believe PIAA owes us better, especially for the price.  I should notate that I just gloves to handle the bulbs when installing.  Additionally, they came straight from the packaging right into the housings.  Everything was installed correctly and carefully using appropriate measures.	-1
Product design looks nice and appealing. This product seems like made out of plastic bags. It doesn't cover or protect any rain or snow. Save money and buy better made.	-1
I can't tell these bulbs from the standard, much less expensive bulb.  If you are looking for something that might be brighter on the Kelvin scale, you will be disappointed.  They work fine though, but cost too much.	-1
Worst product purchased from amazon to this day. I read the reviews and thought they might be a little harsh, but the outcome is what some posted. First the  strobes did not come with instructions, second it did not work using a fused line.. which made no sense... Then after hooking them up all the power was going to only one side,,, the other side flickering once in a while... Total garbage.. And yes I know what I am doing when hooking up vehicle wiring. I am going back to the truck stop where I purchased real strobes lights, they cost a pretty penny, 60. for each strobe but well worth the price.  Good thing this garbage only cost 6. bucks,, I guess you get what you pay for.	-1
you get what you pay for they worked when i tested them but had crappy thin wire one broke off the bulb i can fix it but these strobe light will NOT hold up long in any thing i have them as warning light on my tractor but i bet the will be junk in 3 months great for a cheap thrill but not very durable	-1
Don't waste your money on these.  They worked for about 10 seconds before they quit.  Not only are these a waste of money, but also a waste of time to install.  I wish Amazon allowed ratings of no stars.	-1
Be warned.  My passenger side low beam burned out after six months use.  Installed on a 1999 Honda Accord Coupe.	-1
It came with a small hole in it near the middle.	-1
They do not fit a 2004 G35x sedan.	-1
weak  use only for light things	-1
These are great if the metal it's secured to on your truck bed is thick enough... my dodge Dakota's metal lip that these bolt to are a little to flimsy for securing anything with more than maybe 50 lbs of pressure.. luckily I only need them to secure a trials bike.  I would save your money and go get some anchor points (D-links) from Lowe's and do it right...	-1
I have a 5X10 trailer that I use for my ATV, SXS, lawnmower and more. I needed something like this that would be easy to move up and down the side rail to relocate attatchment points. They work OK but do not fold flat when not in use. They are flimsy and because they do not fold flat you destroy or bend them if you bump them with a tire.	-1
Even thought indicated otherwise, I could not get a secure grip on my F150 with an ARE topper. I spent quite a bit of time trying to get them to work and making sure I wasn't the problem. At the end of the day they would not accommodate the thickness of my shell.  To be fair, I was given a full refund on both the opened and unopened set.	-1
The elastic fell apart on the first one and the exchange.	-1
I have  a pt cruiser.  This to tooo big to be used in the manner shown.  I am going to have to make it work if I can.  Big waste.	-1
There's no such thing as a "Glasspack Muffler".  A Muffler is designed to quiet your Exhaust, to a LEGAL decibel level.  A Glasspack is designed to Barely do anything at all.  Glasspacks are not Mufflers, and Mufflers are not Glasspacks.  I have repeatedly told Amazon about this issue, but they refuse to change their ways, and ensure a "Tell The Truth" policy.	-1
They are VERY LOUD. I will probably replace them with turbos.	-1
Didnt fit. Would cost me money to return. Wont buy again	-1
These bulbs are not as white as I hoped they would be.  They are actually not much whiter than the stock bulb I had.  I should have just bought LEDs instead...	-1
Looked good at first. The metal pitted early looked bad. Ended up sanding the pitting and painted with a red white and blue design. Good for now but I don't expect it to last. Send more for better quality or but one every year.	-1
Tore at the seam when I started to install it on my spare tire. Very flimsy / thin material.	-1
It's not standing up, it's tearing at the stitching. disappointed  wish they'd make a happy face, would give a happy face tweety all the stars.	-1
I had to replace the locks on my Summit cargo box after I broke the last key and part of it remained stuck in a lock. The good news - I was able to remove the lock with the provided tool/key even it still had part of the old key in it. I was surprised by how little resistance these locks provide against tampering. For this kind of money I would expect something more substantial.	-1
I can't believe how much these locks cost. They are very cheaply made and would be really easy to break them. My overall experience with Thule products has been terrible. They have poor customer service. Their products are of poor quality, and their prices are way too high. Go with another brand for your roof rack needs.	-1
My keys didn't have the reinforcing plastic that you see here in the pics, and it also doesn't fit exactly into the 460 Rapid Podium attachment.  The edge of the key hits against the 460 plastic housing, which prevents you from fully inserting it, and causes unnecessary torque on the key, which is thin cheap plastic.  They are already starting to bend, and I can easily see them breaking.  For this kind of money, I expected better quality.  I also expected to receive what was pictured, not a cheaper version.  Unhappy with this purchase, and would have returned if I didn't need this for an immediate ski trip out of state.	-1
Bought this for Thule Insta-Gator truck bed rack.  Two reasons this was a bad idea:  1) it didn't work.  Not even a little.  It's supposed to engage the sliding hook arm release lever, but the internal plastic bits don't quite mesh.  2) The Insta-Gator itself works well as far as it goes,and I like it, but even if the lock worked, it offers zero security.  To start, it only engages the front wheel.  And while the metal parts are quite rugged, it relies on easily-defeatible plasticware too hold it to the truck and to hold the hook arm in place. Lock-wise, you'd be better off with a cable lock tied to the truck.	-1
works fine, but I gave it 2 stars because These locks are way over priced for what they are.	-1
After just a year product has faded very badly. Stay away from this one if it is for long term.	-1
COVER STARTED CRACKING AFTER 3 MONTHS. BAD QUALITY	-1
Last and final purchase from this company. The floor mat was so far off it was sickening. Ended up throwing them out. Contacted company who manufactured the mats and received no response. Taught me a lesson check the internet for problems before buying!	-1
For the record, the item pictured is NOT a Dinosaur Micro P-711 board. You can check Dinosaur's website for a photo of the real P-711.  Dinosaur boards have a great reputation, but I'd hesitate to buy one from this vendor. Who knows what I'd receive? If they sent the board pictured here, I'd be out of luck, because this will not fit my fridge.	-1
I originally wanted the Weathertech fitted hard type mats but they weren't available for my vehicle.  This type was and considering companie's quality reputation I figured they'd be good.  They aren't any better than what is available at your local discount auto store. When I contacted the vendor I bought them from and said I was dissatisfied, they said I could return them at my expense and then be charged a restocking fee.  Considering the hassle and expense of returning them, I just decided to keep them.  Very poor value.  Save your money and buy generic mats.  Considering they were supposed to be custom fit mats,, it was pretty sad that I had to trim the drivers side mat to fit right!  If  Weathertech has one of their molded mats available for your vehicle, I'd buy it, but I can't recommend this mat at all (for the price).	-1
Seemed like a quality cover at first . But after 2 months the smelling emitting from this cover was too much . Straight in the trash it went .	-1
I installed this on my 08 f350. It was really tight, what helped to install it was putting it in the microwave for 1 min so it came out pretty warm. i'll try to explain how i put it on, first put the bottom of it over the steering wheel and hold it with your leg so it doesn't slip off or shift around. Then you want to unroll the cover to lay flat on top of the steering wheel then roll it over the wheel. It might be hard to visualize. It didn't seem like it was going to fit at first but it did go on and was nice and snug. We will see how it holds up, my last cover fell apart in a month (all the stitching came apart) i might change my stars on this one if the same thing happens but so far so good.  update, so i have had this for a couple of weeks now and i have decided that i hate it. The diamond part is uncomfortable on the hands ( and i have construction worker hands) also it was so poorly made that where the seams come together there was sharp vinyl that would cut my hand when turning the wheel fast. it was removed and tossed out already.	-1

Wouldn't buy a another one, the letter inserts started falling off two days	-1

Third set I've owned, they all end up cracking and allowing water into the load bars, then the load bars rust, then the rust stains drip out through the cracked end caps and stain the paint on your vehicle.	-1
Although it has a nice appearance, the cover is very uncomfortable to grip especially in the area of the "diamond plating".  The quality leaves you wanting as well.  The seams aren't stitched well and adds to the rough feeling as the wheel turns in your hand.  Overall it seems to be cheaply constructed, but hey!  That's the price I paid!	-1
