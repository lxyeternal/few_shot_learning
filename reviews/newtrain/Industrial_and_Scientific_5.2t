Cheap, disposable, works great for my chemistry labs, anatomy labs, and for field work when handling strange items.  This is the same brand used in my organic chemistry lab, shipping was very quick, gloves are thin enough to use with dexterity but thick enough to keep chemicals off.  Won't protect against jabs or sticks however (needles or scaples).  For field work we are required to have these as well as leather gloves to protect against bites.	1
I use latex gloves for various tasks around the house (giving my cat a particular immunosuppressant pill, cutting hot peppers, handling particularly gross trash).  I usually just buy whatever turns up first in the search results.  These were the most recent ones I purchased, and I'm happy with the purchase.  I got these in small and they fit my hands well (sizing is consistent with other brands).  I love that they're powder free because I don't like getting a powder coating on my hands (I generally don't keep them on for too long).  They have a suitable amount of stretchiness to them and they don't rip when I put them on (though I opened the box soon after getting it; I do know latex gloves get older/more brittle after awhile).  Please note: I did not notice a smell.  It may be that the manufacturing process has changed in the several years since the negative reviews referencing a smell were written.  I purchased these near the middle of January, 2015, and they were fine at that time.  In the end, these are suitable for my purposes and I would definitely buy the same brand again.	1
No issues with tearing with extra care pulling on and off.  I find these stretchy gloves more comfortable than nitrile ones I used to buy at Costco. Costco raised their prices on those so I am so glad to find these which I prefer anyway.	1
As advertised	1
Finally big enough for Hubby! He uses these when he dumps our camper. Other gloves tore easily and he struggled to pull on, these seem to work great.	1
not too small.  stretch and don't break	1
Very handy for messy household chores.  I always keep a box on hand.	1
As advertised	1
For the price I was expecting some cheap crap but these are GREAT. They fit very comfortably and are VERY strong. I do dishes with them all the time.  Best thing is you get so many you don't even care what you use them on. I'm definitely buying more when I run out.	1
This is a GREAT value. These gloves will fit a man's hand and seem to be pretty tough. They don't rip easy and there's a LOT in the box for a GREAT price. Worth buying.	1
Great quality product for use with wound care, house cleaning or when caring for an elderly relative.  This product will be re-ordered.	1
I use these when I wash my dog, we had a terrible bought with mange and the shampoo and the ointment smelled terrible, these kept my hands from smelling for days. I also wear them anytime I use cleaning products, they are very tough I have very small hands. and these fit perfect	1
No issues. Just gloves. A bit on flimsy side and can tear if put on carelessly, but they are low-cost, disposable gloves.	1
My wife uses these to pick up our dog's "mess" in the yard and I used them to change oil in our vehicles.  Works great for both of those things!  These are quality rubber gloves.  Could have a little more powder in them to make it easier to go on...but they do the trick for the money.	1
I always do stuff in the house and needed gloves ...however, I hated the vinyl gloves (aside from the fact that it is very seldom you find small size in stores). This one is just perfect and fit to my hands. The price is very affordable too compared with others.	1
This box contains 100 pairs and I only use them one time primarily for auto work and yard work. These are the best protection one can have for a greasy auto job. Use and toss. These are well worth the price and hold up well under rugged use.	1
The first case of gloves I bought at Amazon were Invacare and they were great! I ordered them again about a year later and although I thought I was buying Invacare I received  reliamed  , the worst glove I have ever seen! So if you think you are buying Invacare gloves, you are not! Invacare gloves are no longer made! Reliamed bought them out and they are not even close to the same gloves!  These Dynarex gloves are very good! Just a little small for a large. I use them for many things like cleaning, garden work , changing oil and for personal medical. If you are careful you can take them off and reuse them.  UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: 10/22/2015 some of these gloves have pin holes in them. I use these at the bathroom sink sometimes and although I only get a small amount of water on the finger parts of the glove I find that one and sometimes 2 of my fingers are wet after I remove a glove. I have had about 1 of 5 do this.  I don't understand how Amazon can let someone advertise a product like Invacare gloves and then let the seller send you a box of "C**P" like reliamed. I will never buy a Relimed or Invacare product!	1
Good gloves. Using them for environmental sampling.	1
Great.	1
Just as described and a great value.	1
I have bought several different disposable gloves and prefer these ovr others that I have used	1
Good fit, economical, no issues with tearing, etc. Delivered promptly, very happy with purchase.	1
in this need time of mass infection , you  must have protection ..great for doing smelly cleanups around the house.. and cutting onions to cook.	1
I received them today and tried them out. The fitting is very tight in a good way as long as your hand is dry. If you normally wear large gloves, you may want to up the size to extra large. It's personal preference. If you don't want any slack in the glove and tight fit, this is a great product. The stretch test is great too. Other brand will tear before I can even finish putting the glove on. This glove  material is pretty durable and can take some pulling stress. Took about 2.5-3 inch stretch for 3-4 times before it rips. Great product.	1
Very fast delivery. Should be double boxed.  A good glove but size runs on the small size. It fits but its real snug.  So far i recomend this glove. I am happy with the product.	1
I purchased 2 4-foot lengths from Ace Hardware Outlet and with shipping it was still cheaper than local stores. I'm adding a second garage door to an oversized garage so I needed something for bracing the ends of the tracks. This is probably a little overkill 9you could use something smaller like 1" x 1") but my door is one-piece steel that's heavy and there's two 110 lb. springs also attached to the braces. I went with 4-foot lengths to save on shipping since I could each into 3-pieces of 12", 20" & 16" to make a nice triangle bracket. Anyway, 5 stars for this and any other length of it would be the same rating.	1
product was just as described good quality very happy with it	1
Quality product well-made	1
Simple and effective	1
These are perfect for 12GA or 14GA 3 wire extension cords when you want to custom feed one into an electrical box.  The whole strain relief connector screws accurately into a plastic electrical box, the ones that don't use the metal locking ring you can see in the picture.  On one occasion I had slippery hands when screwing the cap down onto 12GA wire, and I cross threaded the cap a couple of times.  I took a breather and backed the cap off to inspect it, and to my surprise, there was no damage whatsoever to the threads.  That is so well made and an easy 5 stars.  I'm thrilled every time I think about these things.	1
Very good	1
Fast, simple, and easy to use. I purchaded 50 for a solar power project. We had 0 issues with them holding either 8 or 10 AWG. 8 was tight but went in. Depends on sheilding size. Fast delivery as we use alot of these. Nice water tight seal as they recently weathered several storms. Plan on buying more. And I don't have to drive any where to go get fhem.	1
Plastic body, I wouldn't really call it low profile. But it's a strain relief connector for a fair price. I use them to put power cords into boxes and seal the connection well. They work.	1
Good price for these raintight connectors	1
It does what it's intended for. Works as it should. I would buy more if I needed them.	1
Good connector.  Sturdy, good adjustment range.  Works well.	1
Great strain relief will grip even a really small diameter cable.  Just what I was looking for.	1
Watertight, and fits a fairly wide range of cable diameters.  Fits standard 1/2" conduit threads in watertight boxes.	1
Worked perfectly!  Has an inner compression shroud that grips the cord and provides excellent cord strain relief.  It will accommodate a large range of cord diameters.  I used it with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Coleman-Cable-09858-14-3-SJEO-Power-Tool-Replacement-Cord/dp/B00004SQH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Coleman Cable 09858 14/3 SJEO Power Tool Replacement Cord</a>. It is plastic/nylon but very durable grade and appears to also have water sealing properties (not sure if this is an official rating for it but it looks like it could).  It has been in service now for 2 years without any issue.  I would definitely buy again!  5 stars!	1
Excellent product.  I use these for a weatherproof seal on outdoor LED flood lights that use a 8mm power pigtail.  When the large nut is tightened, it automatically adjusts to various size cord diameters, forming a weather tight seal.	1
if you are needing something like this that is not super heavy then here you go.  They won't corrode but they can be easily stripped or broken.  Don't over tighten them or use these where nothing will hit them and they should be just fine.	1
Good product and good price.	1
bought a used grex stapler cheap.  tested and fired several of these staples without problem	1
These are the recommended brand and size in the hammer tacker I use. it's nice to have access to products when I need them.	1
After using Arrow staplers and staples for decades, I finally got sick and tired of the jams and purchased a Duo Fast CS5000 - 20 Gauge 1/2-Inch Crown Compression Stapler. I only tried the 1/4" staples so far but I can already see the difference. I didn't get a single jam after several hundred shots - something unheard of with an Arrow. These staples seem to be made better. Note that the Duo Fast staples do not fit into Arrow staplers and vise versa. I'm switching over to the Duo Fast system. Anyone in the market for 5 Arrow staplers and several thousand staples?	1
Great Purchase	1
It's a bolt. Screws on just fine.	1
Nice hex!!	1
It's a nut and it has the correct threads.	1
Small and 6 sided!	1
tiny	1
These hex nuts work fine. No problems with tolerances for my application. Threading as specified. Price was cheaper than at a big box store.	1
Purchased these to go along with the steel machine screws.  Much cheaper compared to purchasing it from the local hardware store.  These specific ones are thin.  There is enough threads for good engagement.  It doesn't look like the photo.  Envision the same thing, but about half as thick.  Which was exactly what I was looking for	1
They're nuts.  They attach to screws.  They work well with screws.  Do we really need to review things like this?	1
It was exactly what I expected	1
Good nuts with decent threads.	1
what can i say, its a bag of nuts, they work.  They tighten up. A+	1
very good	1
Good quality parts. No garbage threads, no poorly machined head etc. Quality product for a fair price. Steel appears to be plated evenly.	1
I chose this set for the ergonomic handles and reasonable price. Sturdy set. I used them to clean out some overgrown algae from the water jets in our concrete fish pond. Did not scratch up the epoxy finish, but scoured the algae clean. Will try the brass ones on the scale build up on our pool tile next.	1
Good value and quality all work fine.	1
they do what they're suppose to.	1
I have no complaints about this product and I have no problems recommending it to others.	1
Item as described--fast shipping--thank you.	1
nice	1
They work really well.  I restore antique lamps and use these to clean the brass parts that are very corroded.	1
I put about 1000 of these staples through a Surebonder 9615 today, without a single jam or problem.  The staples worked just as they should.  Considering the cost of the gun and a box of staples, that's a great bargain. I'm quite pleased with this product.	1
Not much to say -- they are staples.  The stapler though, the Surebonder  works great.  I don't use it for upholstery though.  I will use these staples to attach rolls of insulation.  I used some 5/8" staples for a woodworking project I did.  The staples go into the wood easily and the heads are thin enough that you can tap with a hammer cover with wood putty, sand smooth, paint and you have no idea they are there. I mainly used it to hold the project together as the glue dried.  Clamps could not work as the project was of an unusual shape.	1
Works great.  Perfect for my new upholstery stapler.  Makes the job 200% more easy.	1
Perfect for my project - recovering boat seats.	1
Used as a roller support on the end of a long gate.  Its still functional but a bit warped.  It warped right away after installation actually but works so...	1
Put them on my offset smoker along with a larger axle. Happy smoker now!	1
Great buy and works great	1
Couldn't use due to axel problem.	-1
I have a goat milking machine that has one of these wheels it was cracked and unusable.  I was so happy to find the exact replacement.  The tire is great and the wheel is sturdy.  It is a simple wheel that does it job well,	1
Work well and as advertised. Good price.	1
whats better than getting 100 nuts in a box?	1
This is an excellent product exactly as advertised I have no complaints! Works great with Class 12.9 Steel Socket Cap Screw!	1
These are as described, and thread nicely	1
These are exactly what I needed. I bought a box of these to use on my 3D printer and they have worked great. The price on these is hard to beat. My local Home Depot was charging almost a dollar for a pack of ten of these!  Bottom Line: These are inexpensive and work exactly like they are supposed to. I will be buying more of these in the future and definitely recommend these to anyone looking for M3 lock nuts.	1
I bought these to build my quadcopter UAV because I couldn't find them at any local store. Quality is good, unlike many you find at local mart stores.	1
Work perfectly on my quadcopters to replace my worn out nuts holding the frame together.	1
Wish they came in a larger pack, but was exactly what I needed.	1
They work just as they should.	1
Nice. Now ill never run out	1
good parts	1
Just like the picture. Good quality.	1
Product is as described everything was there	1
perfect for rc airplanes	1
Good quality and much better than buying 4 at a time for the same price in other stores.	1
Great product and cost less than Lowes	1
used as railing wire vary good	1
I rigged up a large shade sail with this stuff and some nicopress fittings and turnbuckles, and cranked it down tight.  It lasted for a couple years, until a giant wind gust slapped the place, which ripped the shade sail and snapped off the 4x4" post to which it was anchored, throwing the whole mess across the driveway.  The turnbuckles got bent, and they were pretty burly.  The wire rope, however, was fine.  For an engineered use, call an engineer, but for any household rigging, this ought to be plenty strong.  They say 340 lbs breaking strength, but that's some sort of absurd legal nonsense; the real minimum breaking strength is more like 1700 lbs according to our friend Google.  Stainless, so it stays pretty, even outside, forever.  This is about the biggest cable you can make a reasonably small eyelet in, and I never need anything bigger for random rigging.  This and 1/16" do everything for me.	1
This is your snare wire! Makes great snares, hard to kink, doesn't rust and slides tight...also holds a 300# hog!	1
pleased with product,would recommend this seller.	1
I've used fiberglass resin & fiberglass cloth to patch tubs in rental units before so I'm familiar with the process. This kit is nice in that the almond color matches PERFECTLY to the almond color on mobile home tubs.  Tips for use: Trim the fiberglass cloth with SHARP scissors and cut your patches to fit before mixing epoxy. Be sure to apply gently and not drag out strands of the fiberglass cloth from the patch... (keep your disposable scissors handy!)(Yes... disposable. They don't work well after being gummed shut with fiberglass resin).  Not mentioned / included / etc... You can use standard fiberglass cloth & 2-part resin on any fiberglass tub but you won't have the color match. This kit matches the color perfectly. For ABS plastic tubs (mobile homes, again... argh) you can use black ABS glue instead of fiberglass resin (which won't stick!) and do an emergency patch to buy some time while you order a tub for the tenant's unit.	1
OK...  first off...  this is a vulcanizing repair kit... not a hard epoxy or fiberglass.  It is sandable when it has cured fro at least 24 hours (any earlier and it just shreds like a plastic shopping bag) but it does not blend or feather well.  When applying this product for a tub repair, you want to be fairly spartan with it because, like I mentioned, it is a vulcanizing epoxy, so sanding it down is not a good idea.  The main reason I gave this product a bad review is very misleading in what you get.  The description reads thus:  "1.06 OZ, Fiberglass, Porcelain & Plastic Repair Kit, Bonds Fiberglass, Porcelain, Plastic, Ceramic Tensile Strength 1500 Psi, Water Resistant, Handling & Set Time 30 Minutes, White Or Almond. This product is manufactured in China. Excellent for industrial and domestic use."  But you don't get a fiberglass repair kit... you get an off-white 2 part vulcanizer (NOT glass resin) with a small piece fiberglass cloth in the kit.  Including a piece of glass matt does not make this a fiberglass repair kit.\\  I guess I need to learn to read better...  as soon as I saw "made in China" on the kit I knew it was going to be garbage, and I was not surprised by the results.  I own a small handyman business and if I would have used this on a customer's tub, I'd be repairing it again at my own cost.  Don't buy this product unless you want to incur the same BS results.  Just go buy a small fiberglass patch kit at the hardware store.  You'll be a lot happier with the results when you're done.	-1
Looks nasty!	-1
It seems to be fine for a relatively small repair (about the size of 1/4 of a sheet of notebook paper).	1
Messy to use.  I threw mine in the trash.  It reminded me of an Auto Body repair kit.  This kit will end up leaving a hump, not easy to use. Contains a 2 part epoxy and a fiberglass cloth to bond it to. That is the messy part.  I ended up going to Home Depot and buying a $25 kit and it worked as it should, requiring no cloth to deal with.	-1
Don't waste your money!  Sets up faster than you can repair it!  Very messy!	-1
Repaired some nicks in my tub with this.  I didn't realize that it hardened that quick and will not mix all of it at once  only what I need. It also gets hot if you try to save it..	1
It drips, it runs, it doesn't do well on anything but a flat surface. But when this stuff dries, it is hard, shiny and very secure and tough. I had to purchase a 2nd one in order to smooth out and patch the first try, but obviously like the final effect and beats heck out of replacing whatever you are repairing (in my case a surround tub wall).	1
Ignore others who say the cloth moves when using this product.  Yes, use the brush to brush the filler on the crack or hole BEFORE you lay the cloth down, but then THINK OUT OF THE BOX.  POUR, do not brush the liquid on top of the cloth tape.  Like you would pancake batter into a frying pan.  Start center and move it around back and forth.  It will self level (not entirely) but enough if you put it in hot water.  Then take the brush and kinda even it out very GENTLY...DONE DEAL!!!!	1
I have been homebrewing for almost a year now and have many successful 5 gallon batches under my belt.  When I first started, I used the plastic bottle my hydrometer came in as a test jar, but that was less than ideal as the cheap thin plastic was not very strong and the base was not very stable when I stood it on the counter full of beer.  After upgrading to this model I have been much happier with the results.  The base is wide so I don't have to worry about the thing tipping over and the clear plastic is very sturdy.  An added bonus is that the base unscrews from the clear barrel so that both can be washed and sanitized.  My only complaint about this testing jar is that its width equates to more volume and that means more beer lost each time I do a test.  So in a roundabout way, it has forced me to take fewer gravity readings, which probably isn't a terrible thing!  Highly recommended.	1
good product, have to be careful to not break it when washing.	1
Pice of crap. Buy a real graduated cylinder.	-1
I don't like it because it works as it should for testing with hydrometer but it also leaks at the base where you have to screw the plastic tube onto the plastic base. I was afraid of breaking it as the plastic tube felt weak and fragile. It also leaves hard to wash stains on the inside of the tube after repeated use. I no longer use this as now I have a single glass piece.	-1
GOOD	1
Works as described	1
A plastic tube with a base. It's sold to go with a wine kit to hold a  hygrometer. Cheaply made. Ok 4 starter wine kit but don't expect durability.	-1
As described	1
Worked very well.	1
This Tube is easy to use and Clean. If came in a padded box and was Undamaged. Works well with my Hydrometer! A good must-have and a good price. Nice easy screw on/off base is very stable. Does not take a lot of test product to fill it either which is very nice! Nice product, nice price, nice delivery!	1
Shattered on the first use....	-1
as described.  just make sure you have screwed it together tightly	1
good	1
Item arrived on time and was as described.	1
I used this to test pure alcohol from my still and it immediately started cracking! I never would have expected that to happen!	-1
Plastic.  But it works fine.  Comes off the base for easy cleaning.  Locks into place and doesn't leak.	1
good	1
I haven't used it once. Don't really need it to make wine.	1
Well its a test tube for the Hydrometer I got for Brewing.  Fairly priced, does what it does...Its a test tube.	1
Not  well made Easy to use Not heavy duty Easy to install Great product but don't last It is not working well	-1
This is bad in every way.  1. It LEANS.  It doesn't even stand flat 2. It LEAKS.  A lot.  It doesn't matter how tight you screw the base on, it will leak. 3. It's Plastic.  Because of problem #2, I have already damaged the bottom from attempting to screw it even tighter, and it's cracking.  Buy a glass graduated cylinder instead.  Wish I had done it right the first time.	-1
One for using to measure the wine...and the second one for a back up incase the first one broke or shattered on me. Works great for measuring your Specific Gravity of wine...very easy to clean after use	1
This is a tube with an removeable base. What more do you need to know, I went to Youtube to learn to use the hydrometer.  This is an edit to my first review. It is made of plastic. IDK the type be apparently alcohol makes it break down, It was stored on a shelf never dropped or treated rough and it fell apart.	-1
Good hydrometer jar.  Does what its supposed to do, holds water for measurement. Was surprised that it didn't leak at the removable base.  Only complaint is that the label's adhesive refuses to come off with soap & water.  I'm afraid to use a solvent for fear of melting the plastic of the jar.	1
It's a plastic tube to hold fluids, this is another product I'm not really sure what there is to say...  It doesn't leak, but it's clearly cheap plastic.	1
This is glass so be careful as it can break easily especially with big temperature swings while cleaning. I prefer the glass as it cleans up better and does not stain from chemicals.	1
holds beer. floats a hydrometer. made of plastic. comes apart. cleans easy. is much powerful. helps a man. brew more beer. get a reading. this, is, zombo.com	1
This test jar is easy to fill and clean. The bottom stand portion is removed by turning as you would with a lid. It shipped and arrived very fast.	1
i have wanted to get one of these for a long time and it was cheap thank you so much	1
Actually, more like 7 bucks with shipping but it works fine for me. I haven't found anything to complain about yet but I've only used it on beer & wine so not sure how it'll hold up to the high alcohol testing. This is also easy to clean but I wouldn't recommend it for the dishwasher... especially the dry cycle. I did purchase some other items from Home Brew so the combined shipping wasn't too bad but I really don't think it's worth the eight bucks plus Amazon is asking for it at the time of this post.	1
I am not a pro, just a person, who used a rotary tool, fix and unfix things at my work desk/Flytying/repair table and the Proxxon 28608 Precision Vise FMZ with Clamp is a nice addition to hold work and stabilize anything I will do while seated there.  It is a heavy metal tool precision made for hobbiest or semi pro who will need to hold their work securly, with a hard or soft jawed grip.  Well made and only needs a little dry molly sprayed on the threaded drives to be ready for use with a vise pivot that allows positioning of work as needed.  Heavy and a good mount for a solid hold to your work table edge.	1
Exactly what I was looking for to replace the &*7*&9*&%^%75! suction base vise that I have hated for so many freakin' years.  I didn't use the clamp, just fastened it down to my work surface.  The fit and finish is like a expensive sports car.  Not that it matters, but even the paint job is amazing...  Comes with rubber jaw covers too...	1
This is a great quality vise! Very well made, and beautifully finished. I love it!	1
Perfect little vise for the workbench. Solid locking, no slipping!	1
Surprisingly useful: I like the weight as it can be moved around on my bench and hold in my lap to work dops with wax and torch.	1
Can be a little bit wobbly but it gets the job done. The rubber cover on the clamps keep falling down so it's a bit annoying.	1
Just what I wanted would deal with again.	1
Excellent, like all the Proxxon stuff I've used. As for the comments about strength ... think a moment: there's a reason why the bench clamp has a knob, not a lever, and why the ball swivel has a short lever.  Having said that, the base as a standalone is heavy enough for modeling work. This is a precision tool, not heavy bench vise. Iron (?) jaws (magnetic) with removable rubber sleeves.  Love it.	1
easy to tearuseful tape.	1
This vinyl tape is wonderful.  Very durable.	1
This is the perfect vinyl tape. Very durable.	1
Use this product often.  Works like a charm.  Durable but tears easily!	1
We use this tape for sandblasting.  It tears very easily, yet is durable enough to withstand the blasting process.  Our items are protected when using this tape, so no damage to surfaces.	1
This is 3M #3903 duct tape. This tape is manufactured in Taiwan.  The tape's 3M label is clearly marked as being "LOW-MEDIUM ADHESION".  The tape is rated by the 3M company as "LO STRENGTH for ADHESION".  The tape is rated by the 3M company as "VERY LOW BACKING STRENGTH".  I should have researched this tape on-line.... instead, I read the part of the product description that read "Typical physical and performance properties include; adhesion to steel" AND "Highest tensile strength for highest demanding jobs".  Unless you are already familiar with a products specifications.... read up on the SPECS before buying an item for the first time. My mistake, so I cannot in all honesty return the tape.... so now I have an expensive roll of masking tape for painting???	-1
maybe because it is vinyl - but this is not like regular duct tape - this does not stick very good - but I needed black and did not have many options	-1
Compare prices locally, and for me at least, it was cheaper online here with free shipping.  This tape can actually be used on ductwork. We've used it to cover old, decaying tape on hot and cold air ducts in our hundred year old house. On newer items it works almost like gaffer's tape in leaving little residue behind when it needed to be removed.	1
Make sure you want the Vinyl tape.  It is not as strong or durable as traditional Duck Tape.	1
I taped my 4" ductwork and it seemed to increase my dust collector suction by 50%.  A lot of suction is lost at the pipe joints.  Highly recommended for your dust collection system.	1
real good price for foil-faced duct tape, and 3M to boot - a good deal	1
Seems like the uses are endless. Very good adhesive and nice, pretty strong thickness. There's cheaper stuff out there but this is better quality.	1
Well matched for the Reflectix. Quite sticky and easy to apply.	1
Exactly as described and a good deal too!	1
Ordered to add to "repair kit" box for when travailing	1
Sticks good and looks good as well, would definitely recommend and use this product again.  I used on foil backed insulation seams.	1
i had one ''hot room'' in my house.  we have hot water baseboard convectors to heat each room.  i used this product to tape some of the convector covers in the hot room.  this procedure effectively solves the problem of the hot room and it makes my heating system run a little more efficiently as well!  i am comforted that this item will not produce any safety concern as it is designed for hot applications.  finally this product is good because it is easy to work with and the glue on the tape is just right!	1
Put away the "duct tape" and use this.  It holds up over time and makes a better seal besides.  Plenty strong to hold your ductwork in place as well.	1
caulking gun.  This was so easy we should have done the bath sink over 10 yrs ago when we moved in.  Prev. owner had set a new sink into cabinet - Never cleaning the crud from counter top and then sealing with a clear - may be able to locate a pic of that - will add pic of new -  Following pre-clean/ application and drying instructions makes it look like a Pro did this.  Never disappointed in any Red Devil* products.	1
As expected.	1
Yes	1
soso	1
I am very happy with this seller, item came as expected and had no problems	1
package says it can caulk 2 bathtubs- I ran out after doing one tub and barely beginning the shower- this SUCKS when you have only one bathroom & it's a 72 hour cure time... Waiting for more to arrive & I will be "bird bathing" in my sink for an entire week :p GET EXTRA! That being said, was extremely easy to use & easy clean up but I would wear a respirator for organic vapors- the fumes are intense! Update: 1st time I touched up my roots & this caulk dyed with my haircolor!  This never happened before, & I've been dying my hair for over two decades!!!  Now I get to scrape it all out & re-do the whole job with BETTER caulk!  HORRIBLE PURCHASE!!!!!!	1
This is good for small jobs like putting a thin layer over the plastic tub tape and touch ups.	1
Well it's white, it's silicone acrylic, and I used it around the bathtub.  It's a simple cut the tube tip to a slant (larger or smaller) depending on the amount you will be need to squeeze out and VOILA really!  It was a good price and pretty easy to use.  Two weeks later, it's still there so I can't complain.  3 Weeks later update:  This silicone is no longer white. It is now cream/off-white color now and has a matte finish.  Just letting you know:)  I will not be purchasing again.	-1
Exactly what I expected	1
Great. I used these to bolt mod my IBM PS2 Model M keyboard. Worked like a charm. Thanks amazon for carrying these items.	1
What can you say about a screw?  It is either good or bad and this package the screws are good.	1
product was as described, arrived on time and far cheaper than I would have paid locally, if I could have found them locally	1
Excellent screws!	1
screws worked perfectly.	1
They work great for what I needed them to do.	1
Do the job.	1
No problems.	1
great product - no more brass & iron for me	1
Twice I ordered these and twice I received brass, roundhead woodscrews. Sent the first order back, but when I received the same thing the second time, decided that it wasn't worth the hassle.	-1
OKay. Freight was Fast	1
it works	1
Worked well, and stuck to a magnetic 5/16" nut driver, something I did not expect stainless to do.	1
I found these decent for attaching downspout strapping into expansion plugs in masonry.  My other project involved securing rubber to thick plastic.  For both projects, plastic and lead, aluminum, no pre-drilling, screws went right in with little torque, heads did not round off.  I should have ordered another few bags of these.  I don't know how they'd be in heavier gauge metal.  With all self drilling screws, for that, I'd recommend a pilot hole or at least a punch.  We'll see in the next round.  :)  Good deal.  Could not buy this quantity for this value at local stores.	1
These babies are tough, screwed them right into some 3/8" steel pipe no problem. And they will no rust! So, combine that with a coil of SS baling wire and you have repairs that look classy and last!	1
These are nice screws They work well. Seem a little malleable though.	1
Exactly what I expected	1
Great. I used these to bolt mod my IBM PS2 Model M keyboard. Worked like a charm. Thanks amazon for carrying these items.	1
Good price, quick shipping.	1
Bought this for rrod repairs on xbox 360. Can not beat this price for the amount of screws. Highly recommend.	1
Not a true pan head screw, it has a bulge on the bottom of the screw head. Only the M3-40mm length screw had this problem as my M3-35mm ones were fine.	-1
This Red Devil sealant is loaded with sand-sized grains that make the product (once set) greatly resemble mortar, although it still has the yielding, rubbery texture of caulking. At cleanup time, the loose material on my gloves made it look like I had wiped out a tray of mortar. I used one tube to fill and reinforce an area of missing mortar between two pieces of brick veneer without having to deal with real mortar, and the remainder to close a narrow gap between a concrete step and concrete foundation.  As others have noted, this caulking keeps flowing during use (even if I release the pressure on the caulk gun, even with a half-empty tube). The graininess makes it feel messier, but it handles like normal caulking products (including being a pain to clean off brick). I'll update if the product weathers unexpectedly.  For my purposes, it worked very well. Recommended.	1
Great product at a great price. I used it on an outside foundation crack and product worked great. I didn't find a big problem with extra product coming out after finishing a spot. Sometimes I just have to go slow, then release the lever and pull handle back a little bit to relive any pressure. The color was good, but not a big issue because after I cover the area with concrete patch I will be putting a grey water proof solution over entire foundation.	1
There were air pockets in some of the canisters that I had, and since the air compresses it causes the tip to continually ooze out even when you are not squeezing the trigger. If red devil would vacuum seal their products properly this might not happen.	-1
USE THIS WITH THE M-D BUILDING PRODUCTS.  WORKS WELL.  WISH THERE WAS SOME IN BEIGER OR LIGHT TAN.	1
NICE TEXTURE	1
works as intended	1
Heavy duty, works like a charm.	1
Really quality stuff. It isn't cheap, but it does a great job!	1
Does everything the description says. Not only does it shrink, but the adhesive holds very well, so you get a super strong seal.	1
great deal	1
Item as described.	1
This heat shrink is excellent, but Amazon covers it in stickers that leave gummy residue all over it. They seem to inventory it without any kind of packaging, so they put all the inventory labels directly onto the product. For the 48" length I purchased, this resulted in about 40% of it being unusable.  The Ancor heat shrink itself is some of the best dual wall adhesive lined heat shrink I have used. It's long lasting and resistant to heat and weather.  I have used this heat shrink for battery cables in car engine bays and it works great. The half inch size is perfect for 4 gauge battery cable.	1
Nice thick heat shrink.  Really like the adhesive lining as well.  Wish I could find the same product at a cheaper price but I don't hesitate to use Ancor's products.	1
Exactly what I expected and meets all the marine codes and recommendations for marine wiring to insure a proper installation in a wet enviroment	1
Great product	1
Worked perfectly with my cheap heat gun.	1
Keeps your connections waterPROOFed. Pricey, but you get what you pay for.	1
perfect	1
Had to remove heat shrink from around ring.... on every terminal.... what a waste of time	-1
Ancor makes great products.  These are no different. I used these with the Ancor duplex wire to wire my entire boat. Probably used around 200 of these and have had zero issues with them. They crimp great, hold the wire tight and have had no corrosion issues especially with using the heat shrink.	1
These copper tinned lugs are high quality. They solder easily and the hole size fits my battery post correctly. Like so many things these days they are a bit pricy.	1
Ancor products are simply awesome. I do a lot of marine wiring in my line of work and on hobby projects and I refuse to use anything other than Ancor Adhesive lined heat shrink. I primarily use the 3/4" size for 2/0 battery cable and use smaller sizes as well. When you use this stuff, you can be confident that your connections will be waterproof. Make sure to research the size you need for your application, my below table is what I use (you may have different results) to pick sizes of heatshrink (Ancor heatshrink and Ancor wire):  1" - 2 - 4/0 AWG 3/4" - 6 - 2/0 AWG (Most versitile size for any battery cable work, and can sneak it onto 8 AWG at times) 1/2" - 8 - 4 AWG 3/8" - 12 - 8 AWG 1/4" -  16 - 10 AWG 3/16" - 20 - 14 AWG 1/8" - 26 - 18 AWG (Some 26 AWG Wires are too small for any heatshrink at times)	1
perfect for my uses.	1
Excellent stuff.	1
If your connections are subject to moisture or getting wet, these are the ticket. Simply apply some heat to the nylon end (where the bare wire is inserted) and it shrinks down to completely seal that connection.	1
great product the metal a bit thin but functional.	1
Love the sealing heat shrink plastic on these ring terminals. Makes a long lasting connection.	1
Very nice product	1
works great	1
The product was as described.	1
u cant go wrong	1
The seal that the shrink tubing was supposed to make on the wires...it leaked.  You get one piece of red, one piece of black for $8.20, but the glue didn't work.  I used Urethane adhesive on 3 pairs of wires to make my boat's electronics cabinet watertight..	-1
I believed these to be heat shrink, however they do shrink but almost melt before they bubble up and char	-1
Crimped well, what you'd expect from Ancor. Did expect them to be a little thicker in construction on the crimp side, a little on the thin side	1
As described. Well made. Better than similar, marine products, that I've tried.	1
gerrate lugs	1
These lugs are perfect for my re-wired charging system. They weren't cheap, but the coating had eliminated all corrosion.	1
I've been using this stuff to wire up several car projects. Including currently working on wiring a kit car from scratch.  First off, amazon is the best shrink tube shipper I've found. Instead of a baggie with some shrink tube all folded over itself, or coiled into a box, they ship the stuff straight, in a box that fits the tube with no bends or kinks.  These have been a pleasure to work with -- the glue is easy to activate when shrinking the tube. The sleeve seems to last well -- one of our race cars is about 3 seasons old now, and the shrink tubing looks as good as new.  I have been using mostly the 1/4" tube -- it works nicely with #14-18 wire, and fits snugly over the blue crimps, but still shrinks fine over the red ones. For the yellow crimps and bigger wire, I have to go up to 3/8" (I wish that ancor made this in 5/16, because that does fit a bit nicer over the yellow crimps).  I was using mostly the 4' sticks of the stuff...I just finished off two this weekend. The 4' sticks have a sticker flag at one end -- I'm not sure if that is inside or outside of the 4', but it takes up 2" of shrink tube at the end. The sticker is hard to get off, though if you remove the bulk of it, and the plastic outer layer, the rest of the sticker will come off easily under the heat gun while you shrink it onto the wires.  Also, I discovered that this is cheaper in the 10x 1' pieces than as 1x 4' piece. i guess it's easier to ship that way. Anyways,this time I ordered a few of the 10x 1' sets, partially for slightly cheaper, and partially because I was able to add oneday shipping for it but couldn't for the 4' pieces.	1
Great product thanks.	1
Heavy duty, seems more flexible than the Panduit equivalent.	1
These are heavy duty.	1
Seem to be fine. But for all these Connectors you need a crimping tool..I'm getting the hmmer.type. Unless you live in an apartment. Because the sound may freak out your downstairs tenants,  if you have any	1
Best heat shrink on the market!	1
I uses lots of these.  These are heavy duty and should never cause a problem.	1
quality pieces  and will make your wiring project much easier	1
Great product.	1
Good Product would buy again.	1
This is the best and heaviest shrink wrap I've ever used. I needed it to shrink wrap the ends of 4AWG cable and lugs for new battery cables for my vehicles. Exceptional stuff!	1
This is high quality marine heat shrink. The price is a little steep, but you get what you pay for. The heat shrink that I received was black, not colored, if that matters to any potential customers. Marine heat shrink is different from regular heat shrink because it is adhesive lined, and offers better corrosion protection to wire splices.  I purchased a boat last season that I rewired, and this stuff worked great! I recommend using this shrink wrap as opposed to electrical tape because shrink wrap is much more permanent, it makes for a very clean install, it won't come undone overtime, and it protects wire connections from moisture (and thus, corrosion) much better than electrical tape. I find that with an adequate splice and shrink wrap, solder is usually unnecessary in most automotive and marine applications.  I feel secure knowing that the wire splices in my boat are protected by high quality shrink wrap.  I recommend this to anyone that needs to perform electrical work in a marine environment, or just wants to have extra corrosion resistance.	1
I have used many types of heat shrink tubing and Anchor is the best by far of the ones i have used.  Plus I have learned to only purchase glue lined heat shrink as it seals the bare wire from the elements.  It is also the most expensive.  In this case you get what you pay for.  If you want to redo the connection in the future after dealing with intermittent connection problems, use a non-adhesive lined heat shrink.  However, if you want it fixed permanently under any reasonable condition, get adhesive lined.	1
I thought these were pretty good until I received the Heavy Duty Tinned Marine Battery Cable Lugs by FTZ!	1
works very well	1
Excellent, Exactly what I needed. It work exactly as described, I will definitely buy more of this in different sizes.	1
This heat shrink tubing has worked extremely well for me--it seems expensive (ok it IS expensive) when you look at the first time price but when you consider when you use this you will most likely not have to redo the work the cost goes down. I have used the heat shrink for repairs to two trucks, two trailers and a golf cart and the results are the same in each case. In south Texas we have not only the heat (ten days over 100 degrees and counting this month) but we also have heavy rain storms and not one repair has failed.	1
These are good quality ring connectors and work well. Price was right as was the quantity too.	1
This is a good marine grade product I will be buying more of these as the need comes.	1
As part of a complete battery + harness upgrade on my 95 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9L turbodiesel, I rebuilt my battery cables using welding cable, solder lugs, and this marine grade heat shrink tubing (to prevent moisture intrusion).  In this case, I wanted the red for the positive cable. These were well worth the price and performed exceptionally well under a heat gun. The final results and look were far better than I had hoped. Highly recommend these for any application where you need to completely seal the connection from moisture (like under-hood).	1
Thick-walled, high-quality shrink tubing -- exactly what I was looking for.  There's cheaper out there, but nothing better at this price point.  Why spend more for the same (or less) quality on other brands?	1
Worked great. No issues	1
good product	1
nice for the price	1
Great quality and price for shipped and being low quantity.	1
Good quality for diy solar battery bank.  Crimping may be an issue as the die set of the crimper needs to be from 30 to 33 mm2 for 2 awg welding wire.  To get 30 mm2, I set one die to 25, and the matching die to 35, that yields 30 mm2.  I was able to double crimp the lugs which resulted in really good solid crimps and cold welding.  There will be a bit of pinched metal on one side of the lug, just cover it with the heat shrink material, it didn't cut through the finished heat shrink.  Alternative long barreled heavy duty battery lugs cost about $7 per unit which I felt were not needed for my application.	1
Great for putting large gauge  cables in motorsport battery applications.	1
Great product. Heavy duty.	1
These are a must use in a marine environment. Most people thing thats standard copper will suffice but it won't. Use a good crimper with these, heat shrink and enjoy a good service life.	1
good quality heavy duty 1/0 wire lugs. great for solder on applications !	1
As described	1
Perfect fit for marine grade tinned copper cable. Great for outdoor uses or hot, salty or copper corrosive environments. Sounds like South Florida boating to me! Cars too...	1
Ancor is the best, you pay for it, but good stuff.	1
Fit, made electrical contact, no fires.  Can't ask for more than that!	1
Very Good Product...	1
The product was as described.	1
High quality.	1
great quality at a reasonable price	1
Awesome lugs for making your own battery cables for boats, cars, welding or solar panels. These lugs are the best on the market. I bought several tinned copper lugs off eBay and for me the quality is not even close to comparable to the Ancor products. If you are going through the work to make your own cables, make sure you get these lugs!	1
Yes. A+	1
Best lugs, just pricy.	1
Handy battery terminal connectors.	1
All good.	1
Excellent high-grade lug.  Add some adhesive lined heat shrink and they'll last forever	1
I used these to replace my worn out battery connectors on my motorcycle.  These are well made and provide and excellent connection  to my battery.	1
If you make your own battery cables (and who doesn't?), you'll need a two-pound hammer, a crimping tool, the right gauge of cable and some of these.  I use the tinned copper lugs exclusively, because they don't corrode nearly as fast in this, the foggiest city on the North American Continent.  They're not cheap - but you can build your own cables to the exact length with these which will cost you less than a third of what you'll pay for cables of standard (inexact) lengths.	1
Crimped well, what you'd expect from Ancor. Did expect them to be a little thicker in construction on the crimp side, a little on the thin side	1

stopped my leak, worked well. thanks for a great product.	1
Tried it on my wife's rubber boots and it worked well.  You must follow instructions exactly and let adhesive set up hard before using.	1
I use this frequently for repairing holes in my Muck Boots. I have used it to repair small branch punctures in the soles as well as tears in the uppers. The tube will not keep well without special action. I put vaseline on the threads before I cap it and keep it in the freezer. If it does solidify at the top you may be able to get some out by screwing in a screw and then pulling it out. As a last resort you could cut a hole in the side of the tube but that will probably be your last use because then the rest will solidify.	1
the only product that can make a wet duck or fishing season to a dry one	1
I've used this excellent product to repair both a partial cut around the knee pad of my Excel 3/2 wetsuit, as well as a hole under the arm in my 4/3 Rip Curl wetsuit. Both repairs were easy to do and have, so far, held up perfectly through dozens of sessions.	1
as expected	1
Works as it should to pass some cables through and looks neat. I hope the white does not yellow over time.	1
Bought these to discretely wire my wireless router through a wall. The are the same color as the wall and they worked great covering the whole I cut for them. I only used 2, but I will keep the others around in case another wiring job comes up. The plastic seems strong, but I'm just installing it and forgetting it.	1
Did the job	1
Simple device but exactly what I needed, perfect fit.	1
Love them	1
This is a nice small spray bottle that comes in very useful for spraying houseplants with a fine mist.  The nozzle can be adjusted to spray or stream.  Bottle feels very sturdy, too.  Later...I just ordered another one of these because they are so perfect for spraying plants, wetting down curly hair in between shampoos, etc.  The spray is adjustable from a steady stream to a fine mist.  My other one has kept on working for a long time with much use.	1
Very nice company. I use this bottles to spray chemicals like; chlorine, alcohol, acid, acrylic etc. So far so good. The only one little problem=the mist covering mostly the edge of the circle and inside the circle almost none.	1
Nice spray bottle that can be used for a lot of different purposes around the house.  Very happy with the product.	1
This was my second order of these; perfect size and very functional!!	1
Perfect for pesky pets. Perfect for long range pesky pets.	1
Great quality bottles.  Spend the money on some like these instead of the cheapo Dollar Store kind.	1
These little bottles are the cat's meow in quality, ease of use and outright usefulness. They are extremely well designed and built and are tough to boot. Useful in the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and in the shop. Even using one to spray cleaner on the car to loosen debris for car washing.  Will probably order more since I'm already out of empties to put stuff into.	1
So far, so good! A nice, consistent stream, well balanced (not top-heavy) and easy to pull the trigger. No complaints :)	1
Works as advertised.	1
I purchased this to do my daughter's hair and it's just the sort of spray bottle I've been looking for. The nozzle works easily, I've yet to have any stuckage, and the bottle is just the right size to keep in a toddler's hair kit. Clean, simple, and just a quality spray bottle.	1
Good clear attractive product.  I like keeping my all natural cleaning and laundry addatives in these	1
Arrived timely and as described. Have not used the product yet but seems to be well made and will serve my purposes.	1
Nice hard plastic spray bottle.  I use it for natural household cleaner to use in bathroom and kitchen.  Works great.	1
Nice large capacity for a small bottle and a variable nozzle that produces patterns from mist to stream.	1
Did what other bottles couldn't.	1
These things always break on me but this one seems to be very well made.  The spray adjustment is acceptable.  The shape also makes it very stable.	1
Bottle is very soft so hard to break it. Spray nozzle works perfectly. Shipping was quick. Will buy more when needed.	1
This is a very useful sprayer.  Great quality and does what it is supposed to.  Have used many others and the spray part never works.  I use these for spraying the air in the house with essential oils, misting plants with water or fungicide or insecticide, mixing concentrates with water for cleaning the house.  I am sure I will find many other uses.  Bought a number of them and am happy!	1
I've had 2 of these for over a year now.  Both are still spraying and I like the clear bottle, even though it is plastic, it almost could pass for glass, it's that clear.  I go through tons of spray bottles as I create all sorts of homemade concoctions from cleaning to gardening and the spray nozzles never last long so I don't mind the bit of extra $ in buying decent ones that last rather than several cheap ones.  I also really like that this doesn't look like the big commercial sprayers that always work really well but I feel like the building janitor with these massive bottles that are too large to store away sometimes.	1
These are great spray bottles and we use them all over the place. We have a half dozen and none of them has failed to perform perfectly. No leaks, no clogs, no breaks.	1
Why purchase a spray bottle when you can re-use old empty bottles? Because this bottle has a great nozzle sprayer.  It gives you a lot of control over the strength of the spray, feels well constructed, and so far I am very pleased with it.  The bottle is shorter and wider than I pictured from the stock photo, so I am attaching a collage of two photos that shows this bottle (filled with Murphy Oil cleaning solution) next to a ruler for size reference.  The bottle is 4 inches tall, the base is 3 inches in diameter.  The sprayer nozzle is 3.5 inches long, the trigger is 2 inches long (see photo #1). The bottle holds 16 oz of liquid.  The nozzle feeder tube goes all the way to the bottom and has a filter on it (see photo #2). It should work well even when you have very little liquid left.  The triangular stamp on the bottom that indicates the type of plastic used to make the bottle shows "1".  This number stands for PET plastic, polyethylene terephtalate, which is one of the most widely used types of scrap plastic. This bottle is made in China (see label in  photo #2).  After using this bottle for one week I am very pleased.  The large trigger is comfortable to hold.  The spray is strong.  The nozzle gives you a lot of control from fine to heavy spray.  I recommend this sprayer!  Ali Julia review	1
They are excellent for holding jewelry string wire.  Also a better  length.  Short, not as long s the ones I have been using.	1
We bought these to remove hooks from trout.  They're good quality and feel solid.  Tossed a pair in each tackle box.  No rust (so far).  They'll be good for removing pin bones from salmon this fall too.	1
quickly shipped, stainless steel hemostats exactly as described.  Perfect for any job where you need to clamp a small item	1
I got these to go in first aid kits.  But, they are good for fishermen or modelmakers as well as many other uses.  Unless you are a surgeon, you don't need surgical grade forceps.  These are good quality and function just fine.	1
I am a doctor who lives in Belarus. Bought this magazazine 8 varieties of surgical instruments, in an amount from 4 to 10. Total 49 pieces. I bought what was on sale and that weighed a little. Shipping cost is almost 3 times more expensive. To me this product came a month later, he was brought to me from the U.S.. I was pleased with it, good quality for this low price. Yes, I know better quality, but this quality is not two or three times more expensive, and at least ten times or more.  I would like to have this store had the opportunity of international shipping and delivery cost is not for every instance of a One unit of weight I advise you to buy a good-quality and practically free.	1
Excellent staples. Drove 3000 of these with my Milwaukee stapler with a problem.	1
Bought this to install my seat concepts seat cover on my drz400s. Works great. In my tr250 Stanley stapler.	1
I like work good Thanks	1
Quality staples!  I use them for securing leather upholstery into wooden furniture, which can be a tough job for stapler guns.  I use it with just a normal stapler&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stanley-Tr110-Heavy-Duty-Steel-Stapler/dp/B000ONZ1D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stanley Tr110 Heavy Duty Steel Stapler</a>.  They do everything you want a staple to do: -Go in straight all the way, no bends -No jams in the stapler (could be the stapler too, but the above one and this are a well matched pair) -Hold tight -Cheap!  5 stars, Great for every household and crafts!	1
Holding, what else to say about these?  The package is a lot smaller than the picture!!  HAHA	1
Shipped fast as needed and less expensive than others. I am using this with a Stanley TR150 Sharpshooter stapler, and they work as expected (very well). This will fit a variety of other guns, but make sure to check ahead of time. Stanley TRA708 or Arrow T50 are the main keywords you will need to see if these are compatible with your stapler.  The stainless staples are great for outdoor projects or other items requiring corrosion protection	1
Nice item	1
perfect solution for attaching my custom made vinyl seat cover for my Seadoo personal watercraft/jetski  standard 3/8" too long, and damaged plastic part of seat. this one went in straight and flush with the vinyl... just be sure you have the right pressure set on your air stapler... don't drive the staple through the vinyl	1
Works great in my shop.	1
Absolutely perfect!! Just what I was looking for and at a great price as usual on amazon!! Super fast shipping as expected :)	1
A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT THAT WORKS GOOD.  Worked as expected.	1
Although I purchased two of these for a project, I haven't used them yet.  They appear to be just fine for their intended purpose.	1
works awesome on my lathe.	1
Low cost and excellent function.  I returned this unit as I discovered that we did not need it.  Received a refund for all but shipping charge.	1
This gage represents good value in a basic tool for all the simple, displacement measurements you need to make in and around a mechanical engineering lab.  The gage can be checked agains shim stock and easily repeats below +/- 0.000,5 inches.  Wear may be a problem in frequent repeated use.  I would not buy one for installation, for instance, on a machine tool.  Since most of these gages spend most of their life in a drawer, wear is usually not a problem.  Terrific for occasional use in applications were only moderate accuracy is required.	1
Lasted only about a year before the spring that pushes the plunger gave out.  It was great while it lasted.  Spring broke while it was sitting on the shelf.	-1
works great for leveling my 3D printer!!!!!!	1
Just what I wanted would deal with again.	1
Dropped it once and the plastic dome cover popped out.  Was unable to get it back in and ended up breaking it.  I don't expect precision instruments to be able to withstand dropping.  I feel stupid for dropping it.  But if something can pop off, it would sure be nice to be able to put it back together with reasonable ease.  I'll give it 5 stars anyway, because for the price, it's been very good and useful.	1
Great Dial Indicator. Clear and easy to read. Pointers slide all around the perimeter. Locking knob holds pointer. I use mine for wood working, dialing my saw blades and fences perfectly true.	1
Good indicator, works well, just wish it had a flat back or a different holding device on the back.	1
I bought this to use with a mount I printed for leveling my 3D printer. Although this device works okay, it was ultimately did not lead to a solution.  The reason for a 4-star rating, there was no easy way to zero the measurement. The device does not start measurement at zero. My main use of the tool was to look at differences in depth across a plane. Other than the mechanical sliders, which do not stay in place well, there is not a clear way to zero the measurement. That being said, I was able to use the device by subtracting differences.  Unrelated to the performance of the dial, this was not a good method to level my printer. The attachment generated a torque as the dial moved across the surface skewing my measurements.	1
Excellent mirror.	1
Awesome product, price and quality!	1
The "dual ball joint" has one problem. Both balls are restricted in the same axis, thus the "dual" joint accomplishes nothing. Think of it as a single ball joint. With that said, it IS exactly as depicted. I just neglected to zoom in on the ball joint. My bad. And hey, for under $4 it is still a good deal for the casual user, although an demanding mechanic will be disappointed with the quality.	1
ok	1
High quality item - works well for looking into small places.  I use it for guitar amplifier and other cabinet based electronics - to inspect components and wiring looking for defects.	1
So far so good.  Seems to be tightly built and no flaws.  I really only need a good 5 inch vise but I figured I'd get a larger one since this was so cheap.  It's not up to the quality of my american made wilton but being so large it won't be easy to break this vise and should be able to hold tight.  So far I am very happy with it.	1
Best investment I've made in the past year.  Never owned a vise before, and I don't know how I made it without one.  This thing has gotten lots of use the past 9 months and is still going strong.  I love the fact that this thing will open up to about 6 inches (I can get 6-1/2 inches max), and the fact that it has very wide jaws (8 inches) as well.  Reasonably priced with a malleable steel jaw and anvil, with what appears to be a cast iron base (cast iron scares me because of its weaker strength).  I mounted it to my garage work bench, and tightened it right down with no problems.  Great grip that holds and does not loosen.  Easy to tighten and loosen as well.  I love the swivel aspect--easy to swivel and lock in the needed position.  I've even used the pipe vise (under the main jaws) on 2 occasions (cutting and threading)--no complaints here either as it makes working with pipe a lot easier.  I've done some metal hammering/bending on the anvil--no marks left on the anvil surface.	1
1. Poor finish. Paint kept flaking off. 2. Poor welded joints. 3. Rust found. There was NOT a protective coating of oil to prevent surface rust like stated in the description. 4. The vice jaws were painted and 2 or the Philips screws were stripped out. 5. The metal handle is made of Soft Steel and is damaged easily.  This is one of the worst vice I've had the displeasure of buying. No matter what we did it just got worse. There was almost no grease on the threads anywhere, and like I said earlier 2 of the Jaw screws were already stripped out and we could not get them out even after drilling and using a screw extractor. They were frozen in place due to Rust and paint.  One of the Jaws came off fine but I did find Rust underneath and on the threads. I was told by support at TEKTON that the jaws are not meant to be repeatedly taking off.  Well I could NOT even get them off in the first place so I don't see how that was even relevant. The ONLY and I mean ONLY reason I am giving this vice 1 Star is there is no option for ZERO. TEKTON your custom service was unprofessional at best and this Vice made in Taiwan is JUNK!  While I'll still buy products from TEKTON  I won't be buying a Vice from them. Returned for Refund.	-1
This thing is much bigger than i expected but it seems to be a very nice vise.	1
Actual diameter is only 2 7/8 inches.  Since they are "used up" when they get down to about 2 1/2 inches, that's a significant difference.  Have not yet tried them for longevity.	1
Thin and cut well. High speed rated to so okay for air cut off tools.	1
Great!!!	1
Good tough cutting wheels  well priced  quick shippin	1
These are good cut-off wheels. I used them with a pneumatic cutter (15000rpm) and they cut nicely. The life is good to. They are not very thin but that is not a problem for me.	1
These last longer than others I've purchased locally.  Haven't had any large chips/chunks of medium breakoff as with locally purchased cut-off wheels.  Will purchase more of this brand and in varied sizes.  Holds up to premium brand cut-off wheels.	1
The company shipped them quickly with good packaging and the product was what the described and they work as expected.	1
Reinforced fast cutters. Some of these don't have reinforced center areas or are very thin.  These are thick, reinforced, and high quality.	1
I use this all the time for a lot of things besides just machining. Why get a digital one whose battery could go when you need it most? If you are a machinist - get one.	1
great	1
no batteries needed	1
I purchased this to accurately measure cane widths (used in rattan chairs). The price was good, well made, and measures accurately.	1
Out of the box it was hard to move from 0 and then about 2.5 inches it would not budge. I loosened the spring tension and now it moves but poorly. I applied instrument oil to the caliper rails and wiped it off and found the cloth dirty. This caliper was dirty. I also cleaned the rack and it was also dirty. While I can now move it from 0 to 6, it still is not anywhere smooth. The problem is you can feel the gears bind on the rack. The rack is either too close to the dial gears, the gears are too large or close to rack. By carefully adjusting both left and right screw on the spring plate I can go to 0 to 6 but only the first 3 and a half inches are decent. If you only need a caliper once in a while these will do. I have recently tried Harbor Freight at $18 and it was junk. After I returned the Tekton, I tried a Fowler 72-008-706 at $35, which is quite good.	-1
First of all, who would have thought that a product name WD-40 will become a household name? It is a terrible name. It is almost impossible to remember such a name unless they did something right. WD-40 is a great product! Just do a search for the list of uses for WD-40 and you'll be amazed. Only a list of what Chuck Norris can do can top that.  And this is now my favorite WD-40. I probably have bought 5 or more cans in different sizes in the past; all of them got lost before I finished them. For occasional users, this is the perfect size. It has a felt tip that releases a drop every time you push the pen down. No mess! In the past, I used the spray cans and it goes all over the place. This is a very convenient way of dispensing the content. It even has a stripe of transparent window so you can see how much is left - clever idea.  For larger areas of application, you should stick with the spray cans.	1
Great !!	1
as advertized	1
No mess pen sums it all up. I can put it right where I need it. Not spraying it everywhere. Great buy and seller was very fast to get it too me.	1
I kept a few of these in my garage drawer, and they seemed like a good idea. However, even with the cap on, all three have completetly dried out after a few months, and no way to refill the reservoir. Back to the spray version and Q-tips! I won't be buying anymore of these. I gave 2 stars only because initially, they are convenient, otherwise would have been only 1.	-1
It's WD-40 - does all sorts of good stuff.	1

Exactly what you'd expect, but kudos to WD40 for the new applicator nozzle.	1
WD-40 is not the best lubricant, but is a good one, but it is does remove moisture.  This size with the built in spray straw is very convenient.  Probably, I would use far less WD-40 if it were in a different container and this not have this spray straw.	1
This is a better bug killer than actual bug killers. I kill roaches, locusts, wasps, hornets, and they die almost instantly. It also fixed a bunch of squeeks and the door knob lever that got tight. This is probably one of the most versatile products ever made.	1
good to have around.	1
Great product,but can get it much cheaper from Wal-Mart.	1
You can never have enough of this stuff around.  This new flip top can style is awesome.  I will buy it like this even if it costs just a little bit more.	1
What can I say... still the best rust remover, solvant and lubrucator...	1
I use WD40 on a lot of things. it makes pad locks work like new. It's a great lube for a variety of things. I love that Amazon makes it so easy to buy.	1
Works for rusty bolts, stuck engines, wet distributors and wiring, relays, water displacement, cleaning electrical contacts, keeping trailer wire plugs working, bulb sockets, and the new spray tube attachment is great, no longer do you shoot the red tube off into nowwhere.	1
Who doesn't like WD-40? You can use it for a million things besides getting rid of squeaks (Google it!) The "Smart Straw" is a great innovation.	1
This is WD40 which works for what you'd expect WD40 to work.  I like the straw.  It allows to deliver the liquid to hard to reach places.  One thing to remember is that WD40 is not really a long term lubricant.  It cleans and lubricates a little, but, for long term lubrication, I use lithium grease from a tube.  I believe lithium grease is also available as a spray.	1
The current nozzle is way better than what I grew up with as a kid. You can push the button just a little, and it will slowly foam out some of the oil. This is great to limit overspray when using the nozzle.  Having the nozzle built in has kept me from losing the little red straw, and capacity of the can is convenient for home use.  The oil itself is great for cleaning and lubricating parts.	1
WD-40 is outdated, but every house seems to have one due to tradition/habit. Most people haven't questioned why things they lube only stay lubed a week or why things they use WD-40 on seem to end up gritty, grimey, and stuffed full of crud that's been attracted from unknown places.  The only use for WD-40 is water displacement, and other products still do a better job. Lubrication and rust prevention don't last longer than a few days to 1 week with WD-40 AND it attracts grit and grime like a magnet, making the problem worse AND compounding the problem if all you're doing is spraying on more WD-40.  In my house hold, all WD-40 cans have been replaced by Breakfree CLP or Corrosion X. With either product, and for the same price, you get a penetrating oil that will get into stuck nuts and bolts and free them up. The lubrication will last much much longer than WD-40: squeaky indoor hinges will stay quiet for 2 years+ AND stay grit free. Rust is also prevented much much better. I use CLP to coat my outdoor padlocks and they stay shiney and operate smoothly for at least a year in rain or shine.....they would rust up heavily after 1 week if only coated with WD-40, and all sorts of dirt gets sucked into the mechanism.  WD-40 has no place in the home. It should be sitting in a museum. It's an inferior lube and rust preventer. It attracts grime and grit like a magnet. Not only does it suck as an oil, it will negatively affect moving machine parts. Use other oils and greases available.	-1
I am not a very handy person, so I don't have a huge assortment of tools. However, I learned early on that WD-40 is a must item in my tool box. I don't have strong hands and after a recent back surgery have even less ability to apply a lot of force when I need to deal with rusty screws and tightly closed nuts. WD-40 to the rescue! I put it on for a few minutes and then I can handle almost any job that felt impossible without it.  In addition to loosening rusty nuts and bolts I found a lot of other uses for WD-40. It is my magic helper around the house:  1. Loosen rusty nuts, bolts, screws, water hoses 2. Loosen stuck zippers 3. Untangle jewelry chains 4. Clean silver jewelry which protects them from tarnishing 5. Used to remove tar and grime from my car 6. Clean off gunk from scissors, keep them operating smoothly 7. Clean terra cotta garden pots, remove oxidation 8. Lubricate noisy door hinges (house and car) 9. Lubricate window tracks so they move smoothly when they get hard to move 10. Clean bicycle spokes 12. Lubricate electric fan so it stops squeaking 13. Remove rust from garden tools 14. Spray on umbrella which refused to open before the spraying 15. Remove gunk left by duct tape 16. Remove stuck bugs from the car bumper 17. Remove scuff marks on my wood floor left by my winter clogs soles  Ali Julia review	1
Although WD-40 is one of those products with 1000s uses, 3 are the most important to me.  1) When your car will not start on rainy days, or after going through a puddle:  Open the hood, spray the sparkplug wires, sparkplugs, and ignition coil liberally with WD-40.  IMPORTANT: Wait 5 minutes.  Your car will start.  Same with boat engines.  WD-40 physically displaces moisture.  A can of WD-40 should be included in the emergency kit of every car, just in case.  2) WD-40 is instant repair for awning windows which will not lock shut, or will not open, or for stuck or stiff windows of any type.  3) WD-40 is instant repair for anything that should move but doesn't, such as garden tools.  Not a "top three", but an unusual use I've discovered is as a small gasoline engine starter.  I spray WD-40 into the intake filters of my hard-to-start gasoline weed-whacker, hedge-trimmer, and blower when needed.  They usually start right up.  CAVEATS WD-40 does evaporate eventually, so it isn't an ideal long-term solution to anything.  WD-40 is too thin to provide much protection against the wear of moving parts.  It is a petroleum-base oil, so it isn't good for rubber (petroleum oil and grease dissolve into rubber, weakening it).  In fact, the reason that you can use it on automotive engines without causing damage to rubber components is that by the time the engine has gotten up to operating temperature, nearly all the WD-40 has evaporated.  LONG TERM SOLUTIONS >> For lubricating rubber ALWAYS use silicon spray or silicon grease&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Permatex-22058-Dielectric-Tune-up-Grease-3-oz/dp/B000AL8VD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.</a> >> A long term solution for a car that won't start in wet weather is to smear silicon grease on the sparkplug wires, paying special attention to the spark plug, ignition, and distributor boots. >> A long term solution for awning windows is to lubricate each moving part with automotive grease or silicon grease.  Automotive grease provides better lubrication, but attracts dirt, eventually becoming a gritty paste which is actually damaging to soft moving surfaces (such as painted wood or soft aluminum of sliding doors and windows).  So, use petroleum oil and grease on hard metal; silicon grease on painted wood or soft aluminum.  For sliding doors, always use a silicon spray.  Yes, I know lubricating every moving part of an awning window is very time consuming---honestly, I usually give a quick spray of WD-40 and forget it. >> To protect things (such as the moving blades of hedge trimmers) from wear, petroleum grease is a must.  But a light spray of WD-40 will loosen up tight blades to make them easier to grease >> A long term solution for preventing rust on your tools and to keep them lubricated is also automotive oil, automotive grease, or silicon grease or silicon spray grease.  The automotive oil and grease are time-consuming to apply, and are "greasy", but protect best.  If you lightly spray your tools with WD-40 every time you put them away, and they always work when you need them, that's good enough.  If you rarely spray your tools before putting them always, and you always have to heavily spray them with WD-40 when you want to use them, that is NOT good enough. >> Silicon spray will probably protect things like fishing gear better than WD-40, but will not displace moisture to begin with.  So, if fast-and-dirty is good enough for you, then WD-40 is good enough.  If you carefully clean and dry your fishing gear before putting it away, silicon spray will protect it better. >> If you need to water-proof electrical connections (such as those of a basement sump-pump, or on a boat), keeping them soaked with WD-40 is a poor solution.  For one thing most petroleum products can conduct electricity and burn.  Silicon grease does not conduct electricity, does not evaporate, and does not burn.  If you want something even more permanent, use silicon glue to waterproof the connections.  > Click on Stoney just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.	1
WD-40 Lubricant Aerosol Can with Smart Straw, I am Glad I got this Aerosol Can, for some reason  I can't find it where I Live and Shop. I specially like the Smart Straw it's a lot easier to do things with it and mine works Great! Now I can get it inside (almost) into the brackets and hinges of my Entrance Door to get rid of all the Squeaking noises and other doors as well, and without the mess, you aim and spray, is that simple, Now people don't know if I'm coming or going because I don't make a sound. I keep finding more and more things to use and spray with WD-40. I tried it on Silver WD-40 supposed to protect the metal from tarnishing, and it seems to be working! D.D. Thank You	1
I've been using WD-40 for at least 40 years. I've tried other lubricants but always come back to this one. One thing though, I've always disliked that straw attached to the little piece of tape on the side of the can. Every time I wanted to use it, it had to be attached and then restrung through the tape loop. This Smart Straw version is a great improvement. You can spay a mist when the straw is down and then a stream when it's up. No tape and no hassle. Two thumbs up for a great design.	1
We use a lot of WD-40 in our house and small business. This spray lubricant has so many uses, from oiling our kid's bike chains to fixing squeaky hinges, it is amazing how many things we find to use it on.  The new "Smart Straw" is a simple but very clever innovation that allows the WD-40 to be used in wide spray (for covering a large area or put on to a paper towel) or directed in a stream to a specific area (like into a mechanism), with just a flick of the nozzle. No more worrying about lost straws since it always attached!  This is a great product, made even better by the clever spray control "Smart Straw"!  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
This is my 1st time buying this WD40, I thought I could have a lot of use of it around the house. I tried on a combination lock for our backyard gate, it really helped, I used to have to try the combination at least 5 or 6 times before I could finally open it, after I sprayed it here and there on the lock, no more problem, tried to lock and unlock it twice without any problem, great product, will probably buy more in the future.	1
Great product.	1
Fairly good quality telescoping mirror. The price was right and it's done everything that an inspection mirror should. The mirror itself is fairly large at 2 inches. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but of course this will make getting it into anywhere smaller than 2 inches an issue. However if you have an opening large enough, then the large mirror makes seeing things a lot easier. The help of a flashlight is always nice as well.	1
This is a very handy tool to have. I bought this one to replace one that was broken working on an installation assignment I was on. The mirror is large enough to see easily and it stays in place. I recently used this mirror to find a screw that fell down behind the stove in our kitchen, worked great, the screw was not replaceable so I was glad to locate it.  I'd buy it again if it broke.	1
works great for me	1
Good quality mirror.	1
nice	1
Good Product	1
Works great for bicycle frames as an added protection layer from rock chips; I used this size for the more narrower tubes and areas.	1
I use this on my motorcycle tank, protects it and has lasted for years.  It is well worth the price.	1
ISC Helicopter - Outdoor-Grade clear polyurethane film  This film is similar to the clear film sold for protecting the front-end of cars or the headlights of cars. I noticed a lot of the reviewers used it for protecting the carbon parts of their bicycles, which is a great idea. I used it for lining the barrel clamp on a shotgun to prevent it from slipping while firing, and to somewhat protect the finish of the barrel and magazine tube. The manufacturer of the magazine tube recommended masking tape, but this clear film is a lot more durable than masking tape and seems grippier.  Overall: 5/5 stars, easy to apply and remove, trims easily with a sharp knife, similar to the clear film sold to protect vehicle panels and headlight lenses.	1
This Jayco grip tape is good quality and generally works well on most surfaces. We have used this on wooden tool handles and on polypropylene handles (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cold-Steel-Indian-War-Club-with-Polypropylene/dp/B000OZC5RW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cold Steel Indian War Club with Polypropylene</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cold-Steel-Gladius-Trainer/dp/B004MN8R92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cold Steel Gladius Trainer</a>) with good success.  The tape goes on easily and is self adhesive. The grip surface is very good, but it is a little tacky to the touch and it did rip after very heavy use. Rolling more of the tape over a ripped area patches it very well.  This is a good solution for most of the things we use it on.  Recommended!  CFH	1
Tape works well on SW snubby	1
I bought this grip tape after using several other tapes that leave my hands annoyingly sticky afterwards. This tape completely solves that problem, as it leaves absolutely no sticky residue on my hands.  You should know, however, that this tape is very foamy. That's the only word I can use to describe the texture of this tape. While other grip tapes can feel like cloth or sandpaper, this one is different. It's like a very thin roll of foam tape.  The other thing you should know is that there is not a lot of tape on one roll. I used my roll to tape the hand positions on my pull up bar, and then the roll was done. I didn't tape the entire bar, just where I place my hands. It would be nice if the roll had more tape, but it doesn't because it's so lofty and foamy.	1
Works	1
Used this to build up the handle on a couple of gardening tools so they weren't so slippery and would fit the hand better.  As another reviewer mentioned it does resemble medical bandaging but its much more durable. Recommended	1
Screws. They work. Bought 100, got 100. What else to say?	1
Screws and I didn't get screwed which means all of them were in the package and not one less!	1

used daily with students with special needs	1
these gloves are way to wig..i ordered the size medium and these fit like an extra large...	-1
No problems. I would buy it again.	1
I'm giving you a 5 because I only use these gloves for painting and home shop work. I can't see hope they couldn't work just fine.	1
My wife's hands are very petite so finding gloves that fit her comfortably has been a challenge.  These gloves fit her well and are generally comfortable for her to wear.	1
I finally found a glove that fits!  I was so excited, but they don't work for the original purpose I got them for.  I wanted to use them to take my horseshoe earrings off and on. They screw on each side, so I needed a glove with a rubber grip to get enough torque. No luck, I guess because they are nitrate they are too slick.  I can't complain through because they fit!  I can always find some arts and crafts project they will come in handy for.	1
I ordered these for work, as I sometimes have to handle things I would rather not get on my hands (dirt, dust, chemicals, etc.).  These are great and as described.  I am a female and have smaller hands, but the small size fits well.	1
My wife uses these in the kitchen, and sometimes when changing our infant grandchildren. Makes things more sanitary and she likes the protection it affords her skin.	1
I'm happy with the purchase.  These fit well (my wife has small hands,  I have large hands, I bought two boxes to get two sizes;  rather than one-size-fits-all).  They seem to be stronger and last longer than the latex gloves we used to buy,  but that might be because I'm finally using a size that fits me without stretching.  Gloves are Comfortable.	1
Excellent thermocouple.	1
Works great!	1
I use this in my lab for experiments at both extremes.  I have used it well above 1500F in a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9ZK_Hs99FU  I have used it below -90F in a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3d0u9h1AY8	1
High quality, accurate and works great	1
This is well made and accurate; very well calibrated as it came from the factory. I dipped the bead into ice water and adjusted to 32F. Then took the probe into boiling water and was spot on 212F. Excellent. But you will want other probes besides the bare beads that are supplied in the pkg; they are too fragile.	1
WOrks great.	1
Bought one... left it on the bumper of the truck and it got ran over and I went and bought another.  Its a good meter.... but the type k probes with it are a little cheap. But I have tons of xtra probes so I don't mind so much	1
got one of these for traveling to not use up the limited space for liquids when flying. Have gotten to like it very much.	1
Love this stuff. Been using it for years to avoid fluoride. I highly recommend it!	1
Great for travel because it doesn't count as a liquid on flight. Easy to use and taste fine.  And baking soda does a wonderful job of cleaning teeth.	1
I needed a toothpaste that I could carry on the plane without counting as a liquid. The answer is tooth powder! Works great, just a little powder on a moistened brush and it works great, and best of all, it can be on an airplane carry-on! Just keep in mind that unlike most toothpastes, this one does not contain fluoride (which may be good or bad depending on one's view of the substance).	1
I purchsed this because it is powder and does not have to go in the TSA quart bag at the airport.  I is a little expensive compared to toothpaste, but it does last a long time.  It is minty, bubbly and seems to leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.	1
I can think of vary many uses for this tubing and that's why I had to have it. shipped on time in a long sturdy tube box. so far so good.	1
item as expected	1
Worhed great on my little project	1
Can be cut and glued. Useful for projects requiring a transparent tub of this size.	1
I thought I'm the only one using this to build a light saber, but it seems someone got the idea years earlier :) Very solid tube - strong and heavy enough hurt someone/yourself if you swing this around. Came in a very strong protective packaging, but the tube was rubbed hard somewhere and got a hazy line along the whole length. No problem for my current purpose, but if I needed a clear tube for light saber or something, I would have to return it.	1
Work exactly what I need for	1
Perfect!!!!	1
as described they work well	1
As advertised.	1
i thought clicking "clear polycarbonate tubing" would clear this from my cart but i was wrong.  now i'm going crazy trying to find a use for it.  but it seems really nice for someone who knows what it is for.	1
Nice tube. Dimensions and quality as stated. My only complaint is about the sticker that is one it. I had to use some pretty heavy duty chemicals to get it off. Do you really need stickers like this??? Getting these off seriously increases the risk of scratching or damaging the surface.	1
It a good, clear strong poly carbonate tube.	1
used for wine.  considering i got 20 years from the last one i bought i expect to pass this one onto my heirs.	1
Perfect for my needs, came very well-packaged. No blemishes or anything.	1
Item is exactly as listed	1
use it for a site glass for my two rain barrels.  Works great!	1
Well protetced during shipment and just the right size for LED Light rehab	1
Well packaged. Nice and clear. Ends a little rough, but easily sanded smooth.	1
Works well	1
Good product, very pleased. Would buy from this seller again.	1
Used in some custom machinery that we built in our office, the tube is flexible and strong. It is perfectly clear and shipped in a rigid mailer as not to damage it. We have been using it for about two months and have had no issues.	1
Like it nice for what i needed it pretty study too	1
This is the second piece I have purchased. I purchased a 2' 1" inner diameter, 1 1/4: outer diameter tube. In my other review I stated that a few people complained that the tube came scratched. Both tubes came in perfect condition. They are very sturdy. I also found that they can be cut easily and drilled into without cracking or damaging them in any way. I complained a little about the bar code sticker that is on the one end (it is not easily removed). At first I was afraid to remove it for fear that I would scratch the tube or that it would not come off completely. I later used some Goo Gone on both tubes and the sticker came off without any damage to the tube. I still wish they would use a sticker with a less aggressive adhesive.	1
Mine came through very well packed in a heavy cardboard tube with paper wading to hold in place. Not a scratch on it that I could detect. Size was accurate. Only gripe would be the blasted label that is a real bear to remove without leaving a sticky residue on the tube. I will be ordering more.	1
Should work good for my shrimp lights I'm making.  Much clearer than the clear pvc most use.  Wish it came in a size that was completely compatible with 2" pvc caps. I have to glue them with epoxy and the cap is a little larger than this pipe, but I can fill it with epoxy and let dry so it will work.  Very clear, they have improved their packing and it is not scratched.	1
Arrived on time, exactly as advertised.	1
Experimenting with LED lighting for aquarium. It necessitated enclosing my LED strips in a suitable housing and then closing them to prevent moisture encroaching on the solder connections.	1
ok	-1
Perfect for the job!	1
Good quality product for what I used it for (School Design Project)	1
It arrived on time and was an excellent product.	1
Thought I had read a review that indicated this works with 2" Sch 40 PVC fittings.  2" is quite a bit larger, and 1-1/2" fittings are just hair too small.  But it will work for my purpose (new and improved aquarium gravel vacuum, using 3/4" ID discharge tubing to avoid incessant clogs), with a little lathe work on a 3/4" FPT x 1-1/2" Sch 40 bushing.  Take maybe 1/32" off the diameter, and the bushing will slip into tubing.	1
As advertised	1
For my 150% waterproof fishing light! Saw that part in a youtube video recommended and so I purchased it here. Good quality and strength. Happy with the end results. Definitely recommended!	1
not compatible with schedule 40 pvc fittings.	-1
Excellent quality	1
I LOVE this degreaser!  We had TONS of oil stains on our garage floor.  I followed the instructions - wipe away debris, cover the area with some water, and splash some of this product on the stains.  Wait a few minutes, and then use a scrub brush of some kind to scrub away the grease.  Let it all sit for about 15 minutes, and then wipe up with paper towels.  The grease came off perfectly!!  Our garage floor is finally clean!	1
We were working on cleaning our garage, and were considering putting an epoxy finish on the floor. I purchased this cleaner as part of our project, and used it liberally on a few of the very old, well worn stains. Worked it in with a tough brush and hit the floor with my pressure washer.  After doing this cleaning process, we were so impressed with the results that we decided to keep our floor natural. I will definitely come back for more of this if we ever need to clean up heavy grease spots.	1
This does a good job removing oil stains when used with a scrub brush on an eighty year old garage floor.	1
Good for the job.  Gets daily use.	1
This is the second set of these that I have purchased from Amazon with the first being a larger/longer pair.  This set is well made and the padding is adequate for my needs.  I only took one star away because the magnets are not nearly strong enough to hold these securely onto the vise jaws but are marginal.  They do work, just expect them to fall off occasionally.  Having said this, I would still buy these again.	1
I think these are decent grips for $7 bucks.  I did use them on a tough project, and the rubber did break loose from the aluminum frame.  While I never considered these top quality jaws, I just shrugged my shoulders and used an epoxy glue to reattach them much stronger than they came.  The magnetic strip also seems to work fairly well.  Not an incredibly strong magnet, but it does work well.  I wouldn't consider these grips to be designed for very heavy duty work when you really apply pressure to the vise....I'd be worried they may break.  But they work for my general projects.  ***EDIT***  -  USED THESE FOR A ABOUT 6 MONTHS AND THEY FELL APART.  CHEAP JUNK.  GO BUY SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THESE SUCKED.	-1
The magnets associated with these vice jaws are extremely weak.  They fall off easily and constantly.  The rubble inserts in the jaws push out under even mild pressure and the bulge separates the rubber from the jaws.  They are not long enough for my vice and leave about  at each end, even though that is normally not an issue.  The only plus is they are somewhat inexpensive and they are straight, but that is about all.  AD2	-1
The magnet is strong, thanks.	1
Fit the Shop Fox D3125 Parrot Vise perfectly, not sure why other reviews claim they fall off easily? maybe there was a bad run of magnets?	1
Does the job and look great.	1
good in use	1
Worked great and as expected....	1
worked fine	1
I ordered two of these signs and at first they were fine but after spending a whole summer outside they are falling apart from sun damage id guess.  They have failed and are hard to see at night now.	-1
good	1
Worked as expected.	1
Good quality.	1
We put this on the back of our UTV. It really reflects well and makes us feel a lot safer.	1
Nice Product, Fast Service	1
Great Safety  add to my Tractor	1
This came with a pretty heavy plastic back so all you need is a bracket or place to fasten it to. There is no label to peel off. It is very bright & visible and durable too as long as it doesn't get whacked too hard.	1
Great quality at a reasonable price.	1
good deal	1
DO NOT BUY unless you enjoy peeling off a huge sticker on the front of the triangle. What on God's green earth motivates some idiots to put hard to remove stickers on their product? I bought (needed) four, and it took over twenty minutes to peel that garbage off. Retrospectively, I should have sent that c**p back.	-1
Great. Does it's job, Big and reflective. Note: the price can vary a lot. Like 200% price changes. So shop around. I only paid about $8 for it.	1
Ordered this item because I maintain a cemetery about 1/4 mile from my home. I have to travel the road on my mower so I thought I better work within the law and install this on my mower.	1
High quilty, very fast delivery, grade A+. Petra Industries makes exceptional products. Item arrived very quick and was very fast.	1
The nylon washers in this set are excellent. The fiber washers are just ok.  The case is a soft plastic which is great. It's not the brittle hard plastic hat breaks so easily, but it's thin and doesn't feel very durable. For keeping these washers organized it's fine, but I wouldn't expect it to hold up forever or withstand much abuse on a job site.  The fiber washers are rough around the edges and there's a lot of fiber splintering off them. They're usable but not the best quality.  The nylon washers are smooth and well made, I'm very happy with them.	1
I thought I would use this a lot as I check jewelry for authenticity at my resale shop but this product has inadequate directions.  I decided not to test it without more information.	-1
Questioning the whole thing after the condition soon arrival, lots of clear tape with saw dust/wood chips and some kind of metal flake throughout the layers of tape and plastic. Re cycled acids?	-1
This item may be good for some things, but it is not useful for piercing. I tried this with navel piercing, and the end of the jewelry got stuck, it was too big for the forceps hole. This caused pain and irritation for the new piercing.	-1
Very poorly and imprecisely made...sharp edges. These are absolutely worthless and as fast as I can get the return labels printed, I am returning these...	-1
Maybe Im using them on the wrong materials, but these just don't work for me. I am using them on cast iron, steel, and brass, in model engineering. They just don't seem to bite into the scale on the castings, and even if they do they are hard to control.	-1
May work well on some materials, but took almost an hour to cut a 1-1/2 inch diameter hole in a porcelain tile. Even submerged the tile in a shallow pan of water as described in several other posts.  And don't use too much force, because if you slip you will make an unremovable scratch across the face of your tile.  Quick note: if you are cutting tile in water with a 120 volt(cord- connected) dremel, make sure that you are connected to a GFCI protected outlet.	-1
Wears extremely fast.	-1
Be good for odd jobs. Didn't expect much for the price and didn't get much as a result. Package was totally smashed upon arrival and the tools falling out of the packing box. You get what you pay for.	-1
I purchased these bits via Amazon Prime from "Fargo Enterprises, Inc." (which was the seller for which this item was being offered with "Prime" eligibility at the time).  Based on the glowing reviews, I thought I was going to get a great set of bits.  What was sent to me was a bunch of cheap, poorly constructed bits--three of which had heads that were BENT upon receipt (needle-nosed bits) and BROKE when I tried to (very gingerly) bend them back to shape.  The rest of the set has been equally disappointing in performance.  They quickly overheat (with the grit melting off), break and lose their grit with little applied pressure, etc.  At $6 and change, I feel what I received was still a complete waste of money.  I do want to stress that the company I purchased the item from was this FARGO ENTERPRISES, INC.  However, I am rating the PRODUCT because it is the quality of the product that I had issues with--NOT THE SERVICE of the company from which I purchased it.  I suspect, based on the preponderance of positive reviews here, this company was simply offering an inferior product, but SINCE IT WAS FULFILLED THROUGH AMAZON VIA THEIR "PRIME" PROGRAM, who knows?	-1
these are not to specs or quality standards. i couldn't even get 2 of them to work in a dremel 4000 (with 1/8" collet). it turns out that the diameter of the bit is variable among all 4 pieces. i will give one of the bits a 4 star, as it was 0.126" diameter. another wasn't bad at 0.121". but the other two will not work for me since there shaft diameter is 0.171 and 0.129. they must be using cheap materials to have such variability. you might get 4 good ones, but it doesnt seem worth the time, unless you are a gambler. with such variability in the shaft, i don't know that i trust the workmanship of the actual grinding stone. since i cant use them, i cant tell you if they are going to fall apart. amazon was great about exchanging for a better set.	-1
Horrible discharge hose because it is so rigid that does not even open up.  Needs a very strong minimum 1  Hp submersible pump to open up that collapsed walls	-1
No Joy.  Attempted to glue about a 1 inch square break on a candle holder stem.  The break was fairly clean.  Applied about 2 drops of glue so the entire surface was covered and held immobile for 60 seconds and then left it undisturbed.  While it took an initial tack, when I next saw it a few minutes later the top had fallen off.	-1
The tube came in a sealed package but was completely unusable. I followed the directions to open and it said to squeeze out the liquid but when I squeezed nothing came out and it felt hard inside the tube. Amazon did issue a refund.	-1
This falls under the "too good to be true" rule.  At best it makes a weak, fragile attachment between two pieces of glass. And plan to only get 2 uses, the first time you open the tube and the second time when your forced to cut open the tube.	-1
Tried to stop an inactive leak on a house vent pipe. The leak was in an incorrectly cemented joint and it was not raining, so it was dry. After 2 days, it rained, and the pipe joint started leaking. This sealant may work for some applications, but it didn't for mine. I eventually stopped the leak using a butyl tape.	-1
Dries too quickly. Difficult to clean up.	-1
This is partly my fault as I am learning about caulk in  2013. It was too frustrating to squeeze this caulk out of the tube. The word "rubber" should have been my clue. Until recently the caulk I use was easy to dispense. I've had to trash 5 assorted caulks this month. It might be good for so e of you.	-1
Tried to repair a plastic hinge, but this would not hold to the plastic.  Tried multiple times and waited 48 hours the second time to cure.	-1
I have purhased 4 or 5 different types of Loctite epoxy glue from 2 or 3 different retailers. I always mix the epoxy exactly as directed and I apply it exactly as directed. Yet, NONE of the Loctite epoxys have worked very well. They are not as strong as epoxys I used in my younger days. Recently I bought a Loctite epoxy that was designed to be used with plastic. The glue never hardened... even after 24 hours!  It remained a gooey mess. The process of cleaning up the soft glue created a huge mess because it stuck to everything it touched. You are probably wondering why I bought 4 or 5 bottles of this stuff before I finally learned my lesson.  Well, the stores in my area carry the Loctite brand and they don't carry much else.  So, I kept buying Loctite in hopes that I would get good results. It never happened. I will never again waste my money on Loctite epoxy.	-1
This toothpaste makes a lot of claims about what it accomplishes.  However, its only active ingredient is Sodium Fluoride, in just about the same proportion as the other toothpastes I have in the house.  So how is this one any different?  If it really has something special in it that other toothpastes don't have, why aren't they listed in the active ingredients?  In particular, what on earth does all the 3D stuff refer to?  Grit:  Could this be the secret?  This toothpaste has lots of crunchy particles which are much larger than the grit you usually find in most toothpaste.  I suppose they are to mechanically polish your teeth better.  Could this be what the "3-dimensional whitening action using: patented micro-cleansing whiteners... " refers to?  What does it even mean to say that a cleanser is "3-dimensional" ?  If this is their "dual silica system", it is hard to believe that it is enamel safe, because silica is pretty hard (think quartz or sand).  What about the "Whitebond(tm) protection to prevent new surface stains from forming" ?  What could this be, since it is not listed as an active ingredient, does it mean it is there but doesn't do anything? Or is it actually there but they're trying to sneak it under FDA approval by not listing it as an active ingredient?  After a few days use, I became afraid to subject my teeth to so much grit polishing.  I am afraid it is going to reduce my enamel, though of course I cannot actually measure this.  But before I have been using an enamel-protective toothpaste, and the weak spot on my tooth started hurting after a few days of using this product.  (Note also the review "Too Strong for Some" for other problems).  Another reason I am afraid to use this is because they seem to have slung so much misleading language, instead of being straightforward about what is in it, that I cannot be sure what is in the stuff and what it is going to do to my teeth.  It sounds like it was formulated by an ad agency rather than a responsible health product division.  Way to go to un-build consumer trust!	-1
I have purchased clear bags from a number of manufacturers. Clean laundry is folded into them, and after carrying upstairs, If I'm too lazy to remove the contents and place in a dresser (which is 99% of the time), anything I need is easy to see in that clear bag.  Now mind you, I was well aware that these low-density bags are only able to hold a very light weight, but problems started as I opened the bag. What was the problem?  It wasn't a bag.  It was a large piece of plastic sheet that was connected only at the bottom. Since it could not be used as a bag, I put it on the floor  and placed a low quality puppy pad over it. My thinking was that at least I could use it as a liner to keep the floor dry as my little pups used the wee-wee pad. Lets just say the leaky puppy pad had an equally leaky partner in crime.  Now, had it actually been a bag, it would be good for what it is...a trash liner for very light paper as the stock photo shows. It may be a 60 gallon bag, but doubt it would hold more than 5 pounds. If UPS or the USPS deliver a large package, and it's raining, they sometimes cover it with a bag like this. Just enough to shield the package, not hefty enough to actually carry the package.  If that is what you need these for, and you don't mind the irregulars, they will work well for you.	-1
This is the first time I've ever used gaffer tape, so I don't have much to compare it to. At first I was impressed- I liked the look and feel of the material,  it tore relatively easily and cleanly by hand, and seemed sturdy. Unfortunately, the adhesive is much weaker than any duck tape I've used. I understand that the tape is supposed to be easier to remove, and not leave residue, which was the main appeal of gaffer tape to me, but I still expected the adhesive to be strong. So I don't know if this is the fault of this particular brand of tape, or if this is how gaffer tape is 'supposed to be'.. Maybe more experienced users of gaffer tape can comment.  To illustrate, I've attached two photos of the peeling tape. I tried to repair the cheap vinyl (I think) fabric of my desk chair, which had several tears. I made sure the surface was clean, and pressed down all the edges of the tape firmly, but the peeling started almost immediately. In a few spots it's sticking well, but most are not- perhaps it only works well with flat, relatively smooth surfaces?  I still think this tape will be useful for other purposes, and I may add another star as I have more experience with it. But for now, based on this one repair, I'm disappointed in this product.	-1
I tried to use this on my car, I prepped the area with some rubbing alcohol and dried it off, it was a little cold, would not stick at all, it was falling off. I took it inside and left it for a bit and decided to mess with it again inside, it was stickier and loses most of its adhesion in the cold. Inside I was able to get it to stick to a metal cooking pot, but it pulled off easier than painters tape. If you want an idea of how sticky this stuff is grab a piece of wrapping or packing tape, stick it to the palm of your hand about 5-7 times and then stick it something and try and pull it back off. another example is a sticky roller that you just used and needs the sheet ripped off, still a little tacky but not sticky. This stuff is very reflective, but does me no good as it does not stick to anything.	-1
This 'reflective' tape is terrible.  There's nothing reflective about it.  It barely catches any light, and unless you're massively photosensitive, no one would consider this reflective at all.  Even cats and owl's superior night vision would miss this one.  It's blue tape; that's about it.  And as just that, it's grossly overpriced.  It doesn't even stick well.  We sent it back for a refund.	-1
NOT GAF TAPE.  This uses duct tape glue and leaves residue on application.	-1
For what this tape costs I expected it to be better than duct tape, in my experience it is not. It is not waterproof as it quickly released when exposed to water and its adhesion was not very good.	-1
Actually this stuff melts pretty easily under eat, I live in Florida so that is real problem for me.	-1
Not bright enough, not very helpful	-1
This is one of those situations where you can only wonder if the reviewers are real or not. These are literally pieces of junk. One was 95% dead out of the box, and another one had a bulb off-center so you get a tiny pin-sized light shining to the side (about 90 degrees off center), and then a dim light focused straight ahead. Essentially, two of them are completely worthless. The rest look like they won't last long before dying. They are cheap but are not even worth that much.	-1
didn't fit	-1
Well for Dewalt I was surprised that this grinding wheel was so out of balance that I had a difficult time using it on my new Porter Cable grinder. But that is the good part. What happened next was a real problem. I could not remove it from the grinder. I finally removed it by using a hammer and of course which destroyed the grinding wheel. Be aware that you may not be able to remove this wheel from your grinder as it will lock on to the shaft. I will not buy another one.	-1
The battery holder will no longer keep the battery in contact and the tool is virtually useless.  I've rarely used the thing over the last three years so, I'm SOL for a return, however I'd advise against purchasing this model and would look askance at anything else offered by this manufacturer.	-1
I purchased this crucible and handle and returned it for a refund. The handle was VERY well built and sturdy. Crucible was nice. The problem was that the part of the handle that went around the crucible was very out of shape, which if tightened enough to hold the crucible firmly, it would have certainly broken the clay crucible by only applying pressure to only 2 small points. It was a shame, as otherwise, it was a very nice durable outfit.	-1
Bags arrived stuffed into a package that was too small so they were all wrinkled and damaged.  Very disappointed.	-1
Very little pull. Not the latest generation of magnet. Maybe good if you want to hold a couple pieces of paper to the fridge. Not good for anything thicker. If you want something strong for cheap, get the magnets out of computer hard drives.	-1
Don't get if you want it to hold a smoke pipe from a wood stove to a chimney started to melt in 6 minutes.	-1
Watch out on the price. BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES was selling these for $43.99 when the actual price should be more like $21. This was PRICE GOUGING plain and simple, and is illegal in some cases.  These should do a great job providing protection while doing yard work without the problems with the flimsy white ones you buy at the hardware store.	-1
Well... It is awfully watery.  I like the Red Devil equivalent better, because it comes out more like "caulk" and is easier to smooth and apply.	-1
This is my 4th and will most likely be my last SpinBrush. My 3 previous SpinBrushes had one common problem -- the battery compartments were not watertight, which resulted in water seeping into the battery compartments and corroding the batteries and electronics. Each of my previous SpinBrushes lasted anywhere from 3-5 months before conking out. In addition, the battery covers on these were very, very hard to remove (Removing the battery cover involves a simultaneous twisting and pulling motion).  I had hoped that improvements had been made in the design of the battery compartment in the latest incarnation of the SpinBrush. But, nope. It still has the same hard-to-remove battery cover and a battery compartment that's prone to water seepage.  To be fair, Spinbrush does do a very good job of cleaning my teeth. After every brushing, my teeth feel clean and smooth (I do the "tongue test" by running my tongue over them -- no grit!). My biannual dental checkups had been good while I was using the Spinbrush.  Until the problems with the battery compartment is fixed, I simply cannot recommend this SpinBrush.	-1
So if you buy an expensive stethoscope I would not recommend putting this cheap feeling and looking plastic name piece onto it. There are better ways of identifying yours from others.	-1
Not worth the price.  A real vanity item. Very cheap plastic.  I sent mine back.	-1
Not very sturdy. Try plymor.	-1
When I received these self locking plastic bags the useable size was not 3 inches by 4 inches. The actual size of the opening below the zip lock was 3 inches wide by 3.5 inches high.	-1
The workmanship on this over-priced PanaVise 308 Weighted Base Mount is unbelievably poor. It has casting blemishes and metal burrs that were not sanded before painting. The three tapped screw holes were not drilled in the right locations. One screw hole is drilled off-center by 1/2 inch. PanaVise should be ashamed to stamp "Made in USA" on this abomination.	-1
As many reviews have said, this is heavy and does the job of weighting a Panavise.  However be advised that it measures 8 inches across!  Hope you are prepared to sacrifice this much bench space.  I preferred to simply fill the inside of the Panavise with steel shot and seal with a wood circle instead.	-1
Be warned, this has Double-sided adhesive.  If you remove the blue strip from the Foam, it will want to adhere on both sides.  I didn't know that when I bought it, and thought 1 side was Sticky, 1 side Wasnt. That's NOT the case.  It's also Thinner than I thought. And by that, I mean WIDTH-wise. It's mabey 1/8" thick, and like 3/8" wide. The ad said 1/2" Wide. 75' long is about right. I've used mabey 1/3 of the Roll. There's alot left.	-1
These work ok, but they aren't very heat resistant. The tip warped after the second use when using in medium temperatures. If you are looking for a good pair to withstand the heat, try something else.	-1
It is an ok brush but not for my exact needs.  Should have paid more attention to the actual size.	-1
Had problems not staying stuck swearing sliding	-1
Should state that its not good for any leaks. Would be great for insulation, but so is regular tape.	-1
Sticks to itself just fine. Wrapped and stretched fine. Did not seal the leak fine. It leaked right through in the spot where it leaked before instantly. I wouldn't recommend this tape to fix any kind of leak.	-1
There is nothing good I can say about this toothbrush. The battery died quickly. The brush itself was very uncomfortable and provided no exceptional cleaning ability. I replaced this loser with a Waterpik which is working diligently. Oh, and the Oral B Smart Guide? It has an IQ the same as my shoe size.	-1
Don't use it all that much, less than an hour cumulatively over couple of years but it already went through 4 sets of batteries! I always turn it off right after the measurement but I guess it drains the battery even when its off. Now the mode switch doesn't work anymore as it stays in the mm reading and won't change to inch modes. When it was working its was great and I like it a lot, better than my analog vernier caliper, and more accurate than what I needed for woodworking. If the mm mode goes out it will go to the junk pile.  Nice heavy feel and precise. The battery is easy to change, just remove one screw and pop the battery cover - there was no instruction for this, had to disassemble the entire cover to found out the single screw for the battery cover. As for the electronics, it looks like a pretty decent unit except for the battery drainage and the bad mode push button. Testing and quality control must have been pretty bad to have so many defective units.	-1
The item arrived usable, but defective. One of the bolts holding the frame together was bent, thus creating a large gap in the body of the vise. Didn't want to bother with returning.	-1
Product was not 100% of what I expected.  I still need to put a lot of my strength to lift things up.	-1
I ordered this item along with probably a dozen or so other items about a month before our move. When 'Big Move Day' arrived and we encountered our first heavy item, we remembered that we had the lifting straps. So here we are in 90 degree weather, sun beating down on us, and I pull the bag out and open it up that contains these straps. All that was in the bag was the straps.. no instruction sheet.. not even a picture of what the straps look like in-use. After looking at the straps, in the heat (literally) of the moment, we tossed the straps aside as it was too much trouble to pull out a computer to look at a picture that might explain how to use the straps.  By the time I did get to a computer to look at a picture of the straps in-use.. I had already moved many of our large items using a combination of a dolly, furniture dolly (square tray with caster wheels), and ratcheting straps. It appears that the straps have to be sized to the item that you are lifting and the height of each person. So there appears to be quite a bit of "setup" just to get to the point of being able to use the straps on an item. In the meantime, I could have just lifted the furniture onto a furniture dolly and rolled the item out of the house into the moving truck.  As far as items to make your move more convenient go, this item is not it.	-1
Its good to test for magnets, but worthless to test and study magnetic fields.	-1

VERY SAD ITS NOT WORTH THE $$$$  IT WORKS BUT ITS SOOOOOOO FAINT YOU CAN TELL.	-1
THIS MANUFACTURER ADVERTISES THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET THE ROUND WIRE SEALER BUT YOU GET A 2 MM ELEMENT INSTEAD. THERE IS NO CONTACT INFORMATION OF ANY SORT. YOU DO GET A FOLDED SHEET OF PAPER  TELLING YOU HOW TO PLUG IT IN, SET THE HEAT KNOB, PUSH DOWN ON LEVER AND THE VOLTAGES OF ALL OF THERE MODELS. THE SAD THING IS THAT I JUST WANTED THE ROUND WIRE HEATING ELEMENT THAT WAS ADVERTISED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PRODUCT. IN THIS CASE YOU ARE GOING TO GET WHAT TOY PAY FOR, I AM GOING TO GIVE THIS ONE TO MY NIECE FOR HER CRAFTS AND TRY A DIFFERENT AND MORE EXPENSIVE BRAND SEALER.	-1
It came apart after it arrived.  The pieces seem to come from different skulls...  So many skulls to choose from in China, probably got them mixed up at "Body Parts Factory #46"	-1
Epoxy failed to fully harden and turned yellow within days from sun.  If you have white countertops that are exposed to the sun, do not use this product.	-1

This photo-sensor worked fantastic... but only for three months.  The internal relay is now sticking in the off position, and will no longer turn on at night unless I reach up and thwack it with a broom handle.  Ordered the Tork 2001 today instead, let's hope it lasts longer.  :(	-1
I am still (6 months later) trying to figure out just what I am measuring.  The documentation is terrible or perhaps it's me, but I'm finding it difficult to make sense of the readings this meter produces.  I hardlly use it at all anymore mainly because it's too difficult to figure out which buttons in which sequence give you the measurement you are looking for.	-1
One can hear well but because the head is too loose, it flip flops to one side to another. I will not buy again.	-1
Disc are not very good--about what you get at Harbor Freight. Not seller's fault but you get what you pay for. Eac disc lasts about 15 minutes cleaning up angle iron to weld.	-1
Decent CPR mask. ? counterfeits.  Case is EXTREMELY large. be aware!  For the price, it was worth to have just in case!	-1
I  gave it 2 stars because it will do what it needs to do, but that's it. The plastic is thin, stiff and getting a good seal will take some force.	-1
MUCH too round...bulky to the point of being in the way wherever one puts this large can. No lid, no wheels and hard to cart around when full. I wound-up getting another one which was more narrow, rectangular and which had wheels. This was far too expensive for something without a lid or wheels. I can't use this one, and it is going to be donated to a recycling center.	-1
came with missing sliders, broken pieces although box not damaged, looks really cheap. Ok for a kids room. Not durable enough for tools, flimsy. Wish I'd bought the metal version for $10 more. I would not buy this again or recommend it.	-1
The pictures were the older style smooth can, which we wanted. When received, they were the newer design with ridges, and are harder to clean.	-1
the Rubbermaid trash can is great and a rubber type of material with a dull red finish this lid however is a shiny plastic so i really don't think it will last as long as the can will.	-1
The sticker on the top that says "peel here" doesn't come off.  When peeling I had to scratch it off and now the lid looks like hell.  Thanks a lot!	-1
I ordered three of these since I needed something 10gallon size.  I'm barely willing to keep them since they actually do hold what I need to put in them.  I expected the commercial grade brute cans, even the 10 gallon, to be stronger than this.  The plastic is thin, and the can is easily deformed.  Amazon screwed up as well, since the box they packed them in was too shallow, and the rims were compressed out of round.  Sitting empty for two days, they didn't return to round, I had to press them back into shape.  Pretty pathetic considering I have several other old rubbermaid trashcans that hold their shape no matter what you do to them.  And when the lids finally arrived, they don't even fit well.  Sure they cover the can, and yes, they 'lock' into place below the handles.  But the rest of the lid is loose, and not even down tight to completely close the can.  Commercial? food grade?  They can only be refering to the formula for the plastic, since the construction itself is barely acceptable for general use.  If you want to keep things out of the can, you'll have to put a weight on the lid, forget trying to seal it.	-1
collects water. bad in Florida for breeding mosquitoes.	-1
I have a number of these with the trash cans, in different colors. The lids do not securely attach to the trash cans and the raccoons bite through these very easily.	-1
I ordered one of these for a 32 gallon can I was getting.  Soon realized as I looked at it, that it was perfectly flat, so wouldn't allow rain or snow to slide off it, and I expect ice would probably crack it at some time in the future.  I returned it for another, on my dime I might add, and got a domed version to fit the can.	-1
cheap chinese. poor quality. just by having it in your hand you can tell it aint worth it.	-1
Manufacturer didn't include the handle. Nor did they include any information on how to contact them. As usual, Amazon is useless and will only let you return the entire thing.	-1
I have used a different but similar cart for years, and the bed finally split.  I don't like one wheeled wheelbarrows, because the load is high and they are easy to tip.  I see no reason to spend any more than the $50 this one costs.  1. The floor is not flat, as my old unit was, to make it easier to mix the load with a shovel.  However, it seems that the flat plastic floor style of my old unit is not as strong as this style of plastic, and this style also makes a narrower cart, which is easier to get through some spots. Unlike the old cart, I don't see any areas that are weak by design. I figured that I should be able to get at least as many years out of this cart (5 or more).  Unfortunately I got less than 1 year. 2.  These wheels are large enough to roll easily, although not as large as my old cart.  I did not want tires that pump up--my experience with those is that eventually they don't hold air anymore. That style is expensive to replace or repair.  The wheels on the old cart are still good, and I estimate that these will be good for some years to come. 3.  The cart dumps well, and the walls are higher than most.  It lists a 200 pound capacity.  Unless you are a 27 year old weight lifter or farmer, you probably won't want to carry more than 120 pounds in a cart anyway.  It does not bend when I dump 40 pound loads at a time into it.  If you need to move more than this, buy a $250 steel and wood wheelbarrow.	-1
Comes off the mattress when pulling up draw sheets. Not worth it.	-1
Looks like it's made from recycled rags. You could not find lower quality material if you tried. It is knitted. The elastic edge keeps it on the mattress well enough.	-1
Defective products  Funai has terrible customer service and Amazon just passed the buck when the digital date switch caused the product to not be needed in the original time frame. FYI: Philco no longer exists as a company  just a former brand name Funai uses to fool the public into buying substandard crap	-1
My offices required us to get several converter boxes, and this is by far he worst of them. It lacks even the most basic features such as a volume control for the television. If you buy this box, you'll need two remotes to control the volume and channels on your TV unless you have a universal remote that will actually work with it. The box itself can't function without the remote either. You can't even turn it on and off without the remote because the box has zero controls on it. It's performance is fair at best too. This box is so poor, we replaced it with the Tivax STB-T8, which has more features, costs less, and performs better. We also have several Zenith DTT901's, which also performs circles around this hunk of junk. I rarely give an item 1 star, but this box deserves it.	-1
The diameter of the pipe is not the same as good blowers.	-1
There is a permanently marked label right on the front to tell you where to re order more signs.  Its prominent, right under the word 'surveillance'. I'm giving this otherwise alright product one star because the photo i looked at of it to buy it did not show the big reorder information.  I'm tired of subtle false advertising and tricks.  Just be honest and show the real picture.  How am i supposed to remove this silkscreened permanent ink? Acetone would dissolve the plastic enough to leave a streak.	-1
The sticky backing for these was weak.  Depending on what you are putting them on, you might need to apply some glue, if the situation allows for it.	-1
I received this item in gray color instead of black, which is very disappointing. It does not match my fixtures color.	-1
returned did not fit	-1
It's a phony.	-1
Way overpriced, I don't notice a difference.	-1
This product was just okay. I only used ita. Short time. It didn't stand up easily in the charger and wasn't convenient  to keep on sink. Oh we'll.	-1
I've gotten more stickiness from a clamy handshake.  It's not tape, it's vinyl with hot breath on it. No stick	-1
not the gaffers tape im used to, plastic finish does not conform well and the adhesive is hardly up to snuff	-1
This is not gaffer's tape. It's not duct tape either. It surprises me that Hosa, a very dependable company, would sell this crap. It cannot be pulled tightly without breaking, and it does leave a slight residue when removed. Don't buy it - it's junk. The stuff you want, for a couple bucks more, is right here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GZE3UJ8/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 or search for "Gaffer power professional premium grade gaffer tape".	-1
Not really gaffer's tape, cheap imitation. Stick with the other name brands. This leaves residue on whatever you stick it to. And it's not a cloth tape like the real stuff, it's more like a vinyl tape of some sort.	-1
Boy I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this!  This is *not* cloth gaff tape.  It acts like not very sticky cold duct tape.  I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I'll use it as a door stop or something.  I will not buy again.	-1
Not that much helpful than I expected since the depth of guide is kind of short and not really functioning as a guider. I feel like it's kind of better than nothing but nothing more than that!	-1
This is NOT the original product by SuperSiphon as claimed on the listing.  It is a knockoff "Super Easy Siphon Hose".  Not sure there is any difference and not sure I will keep it yet, just warning everyone to watch out, this is not the "as seen on TV" product.	-1
Bought the identical "Hopkins" version and it did not work... I was trying to transfer stale gasoline from an (elevated) generator to a fuel can on the floor, but the vinyl tube kept filling with air, causing the fuel flow to stop immediately after shaking. I tried this for about 30 minutes but could not get it to suck up the fuel fast enough to keep it flowing without continually shaking. Also there needs to be several inches of fluid in the source container to get it to suck up any at all.	-1
I have a few of these and I intended to used them for multiple purposes. Once for gas.....not good,and once for water.....also not good. Not a chance in hell these work like they should. I got a few cheap and thats probably why. One set came with a coupler to join extention hoses to it but of course it simply popped out and not worth the effort. If I could meaure the amount of liquid that they "filtered" I would say about 1 gallon in 5 hours. I know what I'm doing but you can't make a crummy product work if it's designed poorly.	-1
I bought and tried this on my heavy duty garden hose...did not stop the leak at all!  Waste of money for sure.  Do not buy this product.	-1
I used 3 rolls and applied as directed and none of them held. Spent $30.00 for nothing. Don't buy.	-1
Didn't stop the leak, and I wrapped it so tight the pipe was flexing.	-1
Tried to use this on a leaking 1" copper sweat joint.  Did not work!	-1
Causes more problems than fixes.	-1
I used this on a leaking garden hose and it didn't work. It may have some other uses but don't count on it to fix a leaking hose. It does stick to itself though so conceivably there is a use for it. I just haven't found it yet.	-1
Very deceitful ad It shows six rolls of tape and when you get the product there is only one. The picture is the only description and so you believe it to be accurate. Especially since there is no way to select the color, I guess they just send whatever is the least popular color. I got Orange. Useless  Very disappointed with fraudulent seller.	-1
do not buy. waste of money. you get a tiny amount, and i wrapped the hell out of a garden hose coupling, even tried it twice, with no success.  still leaks.  so, don't expect a miracle.	-1

Good contact cement for the price. Works best with non-porous materials. It affects rubber causing it to curl. Directions recommend having materials to be bonded at 65 degrees or more for 24 hours before bonding and for another 72 hours after bonding. I found this a pain as i wanted outside air exchange with the air in my shop to minimize the fumes from the cement.  The work pieces really do need to be clamped with uniform pressure to get good adhesion. I used all my clamps to achieve this and ended up cutting boards to size for use when clamping the pieces to be bonded.  Holding power with neoprene and with rubber bonded to aluminum sheet was not impressive. I had to redo all the edges using VHB tape.	-1
Wasn't able to use because it wasn't exactly the color I needed but that was my fault.  The packaging says 3M, but it sure doesn't look and feel like the 3M quality I'm use to.  I did try a small piece of it and it seemed to tear very easy which made me question the durability.	-1
Update: 5 star down to 1 star! Contacted ARB Australia and USA for clarification. This block is for 10,000 lb winches not 17,000 lbs. it would be VERY dangerous to use it with a 17, or 18,000 winch as implied by the use of 1/2" line. quote from description today says: "Suitable for up to 1/2" rope or cable. For use with winches up to 17,000 lbs. including the Warn 16.5 ti." COMPLETELY WRONG AND DANGEROUS. My original review:  "It looks real nice, handles 1/2" synthetic or Steel cable - that was key for me. I really like the simple functional opening design. I haven't actually loaded it up but will update review when I do."	-1
PRO:  1.  Arrived on time. 2.  Works as advertised. 3.  Has dual language stickers. 4.  Bright red and two lock holes in case two people want to lock out at the same / different times.  CON: 1.  Plastic, let me say that again, it's PLASTIC! 2.  If using for SECURITY reasons, this can be broken off easy. 3.  Any padlock can be twisted and break this PLASTIC device off easy. 4.  It "binds" on itself when you try to use it.  OTHER: 1.  It's plastic.  So once this breaks by someone trying to steal water from me, I'll have to buy something better / stronger. 2.  Read reviews, this one got me, lesson learned. 3.  I would have paid more for a metal one.	-1
Medline customer support advises me that the product is not sterile, and intended for use only on scrapes and minor wounds. Customer service advises that it is not suitable for use on serious or surgical wounds. Thus to label the bottle label "Wounded Cleanser" is false and misleading.	-1
After using this product for a while now, I've realized several things why I won't be buying this product again.  First, I noticed that if I sprayed this solution directly at the silicone bead and smooth with my finger there will be "flashing".  The edges of the caulk line has problems sticking to the surfaces you're trying to seal.  At first I had thought I used too much but even spraying sparingly will result in flashing.  I ended up covering it over with another line but used water instead to smooth the caulk.  This time I get nice feathered edges with good seal.  After several more tries, I realized the only good compromise was to wet my finger with this stuff and try to smooth a silicone line.  This seems to give a decent result.  For what it's worth, this is an ok product but has a lot of nuissances that I found not worth buying again.  I'll pass...	-1
Pretty good!	-1
Ear pieces so uncomfortable they are actually painful. Does not feel very durable... Flimsy even.	-1
unable to use. I strongly suggested "do not buy unless you know what you are buying"	-1
This works, but it's extremely gooey. If you recoat your pads, you need to let it air dry for a while before attaching.	-1
I regret buying this! The only thing it's good for is a mean practical joke. I got this to extend the life of my TENS unit pads. I grudgingly give the product one star because it did stick to my skin and it did conduct the current. But......I am heartily sorry I used it. It ruined a large pad I use on my lower back. I just wanted to increase the adhesion. This stuff stays permanently gummy and the patch slides on the skin, leaving goo behind. When you touch it, strings pull up and spread the mess. It cannot simply be wiped off with a dry paper towel. When you wet it, it takes on the consistency of slug slime. It must be scrubbed with hot soapy water over and over. Then, you get white, water-logged boogers. Plus, you still have a sticky residue left behind. I gave up because my skin was sore. It also seemed to conduct the current irregularly. In some parts of the pad, the current felt like a sharp pinprick!	-1
Worked as expected. Recieved in time as posted. Product is of good quality.	-1
Tried to revive and old conductor pad I had and it just didn't work for me.  I wouldn't buy this product again.	-1
This item was bought to promote a contact between the skin and a heart rate watch from SwimOutlet who advertised that a good contact was necessary. Tried the watch with and without the contact gel. Neither worked. I doubt it was the fault of the gel. I thought it was the fault of the watch, and sent it back and received a credit. I wanted a heart rate meter because I was under great workload in physical therapy.	-1
SUPER GARBAGE.  I'm not expecting a Littman or professional quality stethoscope, by the way.  I have significant medical experience, and actually one steth. I use is actually really cheap, but it works well.  I'm getting these for students of a class.... but when I tried to use one, it was HORRIBLE.  Very muffled heart sounds -- don't waste your time & money.  Furthermore, this company is now asking me to PAY FOR SHIPPING ($10.18)-- even though when I bought them it was with "free shipping."  This is in ADDITION TO THE 15% RESTOCKING FEE.  How they can retroactively ask for shipping is beyond me.  Whoever runs this company, I hate them!  I'm contacting amazon, and I'll update this review as to the conclusion.  In the mean time, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!	-1
The nails aren't the lengths listed, and the (very small) package doesn't separate the various sizes. The stripes of nails easily break and become unusable. Better packaging is definitely needed. I'll buy individual boxes by size from now on.	-1
Can not choose color, so you get the one you don't want.  Also, rubber o-ring on these go bad, when you replace battery's you can't get the cover back on. I took the seal off but then water leaked in and rusted on the battery terminals (and batteries).	-1
Terrible. Wasn't even able to close the box using high end rg6 cable. If the cable is high quality the fitting will be too big to shut.	-1
Vulkem brand not sold at local big box store.  I used this to seal around my vinyl window after initial installer's silicone caulk peeled.  I got a fresh tube and the sealant flowed out easily.  I used a battery powered caulk gun so I can't tell how much pressure is needed if using a manual caulk gun.  I know the label recommended using soapy water to smooth out the sealant but I used WD40 instead and it came out smooth.  Only time will tell if this holds up.  Update (1/2017):  During a rainy spell, window frame started leaking inside at the top of both ends.  Went out to look and this sealant had shrunk and peeled off the window at both ends.  This was caulked no less than a year ago.  I guess I'll go back to using 100% Silicone for windows from now on.  The time, expense and incurring water damage from using this product is very disappointing to say the least.  Not recommended for windows or any smooth surfaces due to adhesion problems!	-1
Not a great teaching tool. It's a little tricky getting it to rest on the stand.	-1
Everything I read stated the latex caulk was user friendly. Not so. No matter how hard I squeezed the caulk would not flow. It came out in globs. I even stuck a paper clip in the hole to ensure there was not any blockage. I had to throw it away. More wasted money.	-1
Should have read all the reviews before I purchased this product. Just like the others  the ph tester arrived with No fluid in the cap, dried  up foam  was stuck to the electrode!!! they also did not give enough storage solution to add to the cap, which left me with only the ph buffer solutions to store , it has been giving fluctuate  readings not accurate  readings  beware	-1
[...]  The above shopping cart is from Kmart and its rocks. First I bought this and it was awful... not good enough.  Then I got the one in the link and WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't make the same mistake as me!  I do NOT work for KMART or the company that makes this cart!  HONEST!	-1
Junk- Hard Brittle plastic tape that don't stick .  You wrap it around a wire and the end doesn't stick- it peels off.  Junk	-1
I am not a fan of the screws that I got.  I pre-drilled my holes in a fiberglass boat - not the thickest or strongest of materials out there.  Using a hand-driver, I still had a few screws bend on me while cutting the threads in the holes, and I had 2 snap on me inside the fiberglass, forcing me to re-drill all the holes and wind up with extra holes in the boat - not a good thing.  I wasn't cranking down on the screws with monster truck force, and they gave no warning of binding or failing - just snapped clean off.  I'm less than thrilled with these screws.  For what it's worth, I got the #4 screws, so maybe the larger diameter options are better?	-1
If you're looking for something to wander around your tile floor and pick up dirt, and you don't have very many obstacles in the room, and you don't mind the sound of a shrieking robot, get this item!  If you have carpets or furniture or sleep when it's running, go elsewhere.  Edit:  It's a month later and this thing died.  Now I have a dead shrieking robot.  Which is only good for when my ex-wife comes over.  Seriously, screw her.	-1
The worst tape I have ever bought.  This is NOT duct tape.  It is just thin palstic tape with no cloth backing.  Scotch should relable this as "The Cheap Stuff, Not Duct Tape".  Look elsewhere for duct tape.	-1
I was really disappointed in this tape. I expected better from Scotch. It is thin and it does not stick well. I will not buy this again.	-1
Not brown like the photo. It states brown on the label and looks brown in the item photo, but is actually gold.  No where near brown.	-1
Inaccurate temperatures; is always 2 to 5 degrees off. Also skips numbers, i.e., 75, 76 and 78 degrees always reads 77. This is one weird piece of crap. DO NOT purchase.	-1
The unit I received was not accurate. I tested it and compared it to my thermostat in my house  along with other thermostats I have. I also compared it to another unit I bought here that has a wireless receiver. And tested against my local weather station reports. This unit was 20% off on the humidity and 10-15 off on the temp.	-1
I had wondered why my very expensive sapplings were dying since I was monitoring them so closely.  After reading reviews about this montor, I checked the digital readout for temperature against that of several very dependable thermometers and this instrument reads 5 DEGREES TOO LOW!  I was cooking my sapplings because I thought the temperature was low enough to keep them out of the risk of harm.  I do not know about the hygrometer; but, if the reading were important to me, I would also check it against other reliable sources.  These reviews helped me find the deadly link in my plant growing setup.  The temperature gauge was very inaccurate!	-1
Works great but it keep resetting it's self so I'm not able to keep a close eye on the highs and lows ... it won't keep the recorded high or low for more then few hours	-1
worked fine for about a month, but hasn't kept accurate temp for at least a week. now some portions of digits not displaying. and reading 10F indoors. actual temp is about 70F. tried new batteries. same exact result. can't return after 30 days - i tried. also, the INCREDIBLY SMALL DISPLAY on this thing isn't much larger than a book of matches. definitely wouldn't buy again. i tend to like Amazon recommendations, but ended up with a real dud, this time.	-1
Humidity level off by 11% showing less than actual humidity. Only visible during day time with strong light shining on it from right angle.	-1
I have a black/silver unit and a black unit. The black/silver one works better...tracks my thermostat temperature and humidity readings more closely, and gives meaningful high and low values. The black unit's high and low values are supposed to cover the last 24 hours, but they actually cover a shorter period. The black unit occasionally shows 1% humidity, and it's dry in here, but not that dry. The white unit looks identical to the black one, other than color, so it presumably works the same. The black unit and white unit have a more logical display arrangement, so it's too bad that they don't work as well as the black/silver unit (older model?).	-1
I don't know why it would say 45% humidity is low and 29% humidity is ok this don't seem very accurate to me.	-1
it diding not work.	-1
Doesn't work very well humidity doesn't seem to change and the temperature doesn't change at all	-1
Not accurate in both temperature and humidity reading when compared to furnace/thermostat and humidifier settings.  Product also not eligible for return.	-1
Useless for humidity. Humidity was consistently 10% off versus 2 other humidity gauges I have.	-1
I purchased this because if was supposed to remove graffiti from concrete. We had a eight foot section of a concrete retaining wall spray painted with red paint by some hoodlums. I followed the instructions precisely. Then I tried a second and third application. I was not able to get one piece of the graffiti removed. It is imbedded in the concrete. Has been on about three weeks. I wanted this to work but looks like it is not going to happen. Cannot recommend for concrete. Perhaps it would have worked on some other surface, at least the reviews say it will.	-1
Reads 77 degrees all the time, tried taking out the batteries to reset it a few times and still 77 degrees. Past the return period so I guess I'll use it for a paper weight.	-1
Wanted another digital thermometer /hygrometer for another room & foolishly went with this acu-rite junk when I should've bought same 1 I had. Temp off by a good # of degrees & humidity way off.   I have a no frills, inexpensive basic as it gets 1 that says Thermo meter on bottom & it's insanely accurate.  Fast reads too. Then this acu-wrong junk & another crap brand that reads 19% humidity all the time, except in excessive humidity which will read around 21%. Wrong! Both r fancier than my perfect basic 1 but useless.  I'll take my boring looking, super accurate 1 all day over these junkers.	-1
I have had this now for a year and it is inaccurate by 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  I have set the a/c in the house to 78 and it shows 73.  I have also tested the area this sits with an infrared thermometer and that shows the temperature to be 77.8.  I even changed the battery.  Who knows how accurate the humidity sensor is.  Not sure how this has so many good reviews.	-1
I bought this a few months ago, and already doesn't work. The seller, Chaney Instruments, should refund my money. I never dropped it or mishandled it. It is only 2 months hold, yet it doesn't work any longer. The numbers on it or all distorted. Even when it did work, it didn't make sense. It would show my lowest temperature recorded inside my place at 72 degrees F, yet when looking at my current temp, it showed 68. Go figure.	-1
I've had one for about a year.  Trusted it completely.  Liked it so much - especially the 24 hour hi/low function, I bought 3 more for my new greenhouse.  Can't trust any of them.  You be the judge - see the photos.	-1
worked for less than a month before it just stopped working.	-1
I love the slots for holding the bag in place. Nice purchase; just wish the lid for this didn't cost more than the can (from most sellers), itself. two stars removed for that "bait and switch" type marketing disgrace.	-1
I found the temperature measurements for this unit to be way off in the short-term, compared against 3 other extremely accurate units. I expected this thing to update fairly quickly, but in hindsight this unit is better for reading the average temperature and humidity of a room over the course of a day, rather than obtaining a new temperature measurement within minutes. Would not recommend for use with an indoor garden.	-1
Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.	-1
I've had this unit less than a mount and it's dead. The screen has died and is so dim that it's unreadable and it's ineligible for a refund/return. Avoid this, spend a little more and get something quality.	-1
Stopped working after 10 months. No joy getting it fixed or replaced.	-1
Just arrived today. Put 2 different batteries in it and didn't work. Great that Amazon was able to refund me but I wanted a working item. Poor quality control on manufacturer.	-1
I have many of these cheap hygrometers (different models and brands) and none of them are anywhere near accurate with RH or even temp. You get what you pay for.	-1
Arrived non-functional. After inserting the battery the screen lit up and it displayed 14 degrees F and 16% humidity. I thought it just needed to calibrate or something along those lines well after sitting for several minutes it refused to read anything other than 14/16. The only button on the device is to switch from F to C and all that did was display the same wrong temp in C.	-1
The battery cover was jammed shut. The fragile supporting hinge for the monitor stay came off in the effort to open the battery cover. The display appears to be good otherwise.	-1
It stopped displaying clearly after one month. I have had good luck with AcuRite up to now so I purchased another. Time will tell.	-1
Lasted less than a month before display failed (became garbled). Tried new battery.	-1
Not accurate, varies between 3-4% off, and not returnable through Amazon. Bought for a guitar case to keep guitar within acceptable humidity range, and this is also too big for case. The ThermoPro TP50 is more accurate, $4 cheaper, and smaller.	-1
As other reviewers have noted, this thing is not accurate. Compared to other hygrometers, it gives very inaccurate readings. Cheap, disappointing, prolly made in China...	-1
Trash. Sprinkle a little water on these things and it'll stop working instantly. Had to buy three more just because of that issue. Needs to be water proof	-1
It worked great, for exactly 34 days.  Then the numbers started disappearing.  See photo.  Makes use impossible.  New battery did not help.  Frustrating, because I did like it.	-1
I have 2 side by side...and they are 2 degrees different always.	-1
the humidity is 6-8 5 off & temp. is 2 degrees off. & seller has not got back to me.	-1
These things are straight junk...  Bought 6 of them and almost  all broke within 2 months of buying them...  2 came with broken clips, I really don't care about that...  5 of the 6, the magnets' glue came off so the magnets won't stick to the device...  3 so far are showing partial numbers for the temp and humidity, making them unreadable and useless....	-1
I bought two of these to compare humidity in two apartments. I thought I would sit them together so I could callibrate any differences. See the photo for how they are right out of the box.  Probably just a case of one bad unit, but that doesn't help me today, when I was counting on using them. And, I don't even really know which one to send back, or if the one that's more likely right is close to actually being right.	-1
I bought two. They were both Way off in regards to humidity. With semi-calibrated equipment I knew the room was about 68% humidity, but both units read 40% & 41% respectively. I ordered these two units a week apart, so I doubt they were "next" to each other during assembly. Amazon DOES NOT honor returns unless you write them and ask really really nice. That was a first for me after ten years of being a prime member.	-1
New review after using it for over a year: It's not accurate. I have it right next to a more accurate and precise humidity monitor and this one is up to 6% off. Pay the extra few dollars and get one that does what it's supposed to.  Original review when I first got it: Very helpful and easy to set up and use. Clear, large, easy to read data give me exactly what I need. I like how it has the highs and lows for the last 48 hours too.	-1
5 degree off (lower) than actual temperature. Had to throw it into the trash can.	-1
It's nice but it seems to resolve temps by 2 degrees. Mine reads out only temp odd-numbered temps, so if it's 72 degrees, I won't know it. If you're going to buy a thermometer, it seems to me that a 1-degree resolution is not too much to ask.	-1
I have been using four of these units in my basement for the past three months.  Last night I decided to check them for consistency.  I place all four next to each other.  After 15 minutes, all four units had different humidity readings.  I left them together over night; this morning, they are all different again.  CRAZY different, ranging from 63% to 72%.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!	-1
it's very unresponsive to changes in temperature or humidity. I'm beginning to question its overall accuracy.  Good to use to get an idea of the temperature or humidity of somewhere if you let it sit for a couple hours to equalize, but not useful for short-term purposes like testing out an AC system in a small room.	-1
I have ordered these twice about a year apart.  In total I purchased 6 units.  5 of them read within a % of each other.  One is way off...by 10 to 15%.  Although I would have liked all 6 to be matched this is not bad for such an inexpensive device.  I use mine to check my photographic equipment humidity box and to check the levels in the house.  Good product.  Have not bothered to contact Amazon or the vendor about the one bad unit.  Perhaps I will....perhaps too much trouble.  I am pleased with the product.  BTW two of my units (both read accurate) have been running over a year on the battery....so I think this is low battery consumption.  Very pleased.  UPDATE 5/27/16 I lowered my rating to two stars.  This review is not only the product but on Amazon.  Yes Amazon ..I have been a PRIME member for several years and make many many purchases.  I decided to return the one bad unit and the online information states I have till June 2 to initiate a return.  But when I go through the return process it states the item is not eligible for return and provides me a link to the return policy.  Of course I can not find anything that is associated with this device.  So...the product is good if you can accept a failure rate of 1 in 6 and can accept a no-return policy.  I figure this is worth 2 stars.  Sorry Amazon....I still love your service but this time you did not come through.	-1
First off, I have TWO of these units, the first I'd purchased from Amazon, the second was a replacement sent free by Amazon when I requested a return on the first due to accuracy issues. I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.  To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.  The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.  FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.	-1
I give this a 1, only because it worked for 2/3 of a year woohoo, zero would be more appropriate.  This is junk. Spend your money on something better.	-1
Works great for a brief period then starts being completely wrong. You have to remove the battery to reset it and it will work for another short period. It will read 16 degrees in my house when it's obviously near 70 degrees.	-1
lasted a week	-1
Very inaccurate. Would not buy again.	-1
Plastic garbage. This product is only good for very light use. May be useful to model kit hobbyists to keep light and sensitive objects in place. Not for moderate use at all. It will not hold metal or wood in place. If you tighten it too much it will start to give and will damage the plastic grip. You get what you pay for.	-1
The ball joint that lets you use the vise at different angles isn't very secure. I found myself tapping on my project and having the whole ball joint move or the vise rotate which defeats the purpose of having the vise so I returned it.	-1
Every part of this loosens and flexes when minimal force is applied (~5 inch pounds).  I had one of these snap at about 25 inch pounds.  They tend to snap at the part that holds the ball pivot.	-1
Went to use this just today, there is a crack in the housing preventing it from being tightened enough to hold anything. Already have a replacement on the way. I'll update this review once I have the new vice and am able to use it.	-1
There is nothing 'right' about this device....the 5 stars , we'll...no idea what they are thinking.  Doesn't tighten properly  Heavily plastic  Ballpoint won't stay put  Rubber slides around out of place under any pressure  It is simply awful , do not buy this....please.	-1
This reads a different temperature and humidity than my thermostat when sitting right below it.	-1
Not the best of shape when it arrived as the corner was beat.	-1
Says that it is 12x12 inch but actually came 11.75x11.75 inch.  Unfortunately this is too small for what I needed and took 2 months for it to arrive.	-1
This sheet is undersize. Someone else mentioned this, too. Mine are 1/4" and 3/16" shy of being 12" square. Unfortunately I *do* need the full 12", so this isn't going to work well.  If people have a hard time with their cutting tolerances, they should make sure they err on the large side instead of shafting people.	-1
Undersized sheet, warped, wouldn't adhere to print bed. Waste of time & money.  I installed this curled PEI sheet using the recommended 3M 468MP adhesive sheet.  The first time I tried to use it, the bed started to preheat and the PEI warped back off the bed at the front and back edges when the adhesive warmed and the PEI returned to its curled shape.  I removed the bed and use a brayer to roll the PEI into the adhesive and did a test reheating.  It stuck a bit better for a few minutes then rolled off the bed again in the front and back.  It's completely unusable.  I never touched the PEI with my fingers to contaminate it.  I peeled the protective sheet and immediately applied the PEI to the adhesive.  I guess I'll buy Ultem sheets from an industrial supplier that I use, for about the same price and I'm likely to get FLAT sheets of Ultem so I can hopefully avoid this wasted time and effort.  I'll also get actual 12" sheets instead of these 11.8" sheets that are so small that my 6"X9" print bed can only get one sheet out of this supposedly 12"X12" sheet of PEI.	-1
As others have stated, the sheet I received was warped. Thinking that it would be fine once I glued it to the hotbed I was wrong. It caused the bed to warp so leveling was impossible. Others have reported that the received a flat sheet, but it like rolling the dice when you order. Look elsewhere..	-1
While this PEI surface on my printer bed is good for adhesion, I had serious problems getting this sheet to stick to either the aluminum bed or a glass plate even using 3M 468 adhesive.  The problem is that the sheet of PEI I received was warped about 1/2" over 12 inches length.  I did not think this was a problem and mounted it, then ended up stripping and remount it several times.  That small, permanent warp in this PEI sheet caused no end of problems with it lifting off the bed at the edges.  PEI is flexible but does not conform well and tension always existed at the edges.  A flat sheet from another supplier has not had this problem.  I'm testing to see if mounting it with the warp down will work any better, but frankly don't have much hope for it.  Perhaps what I got is an anomaly, but I've wasted a ton of time trying to get this particular product to work properly.	-1
These sheets should be as perfectly flat as possible to be used on a 3D printer bed.  The two I received are horribly curled like they were cut from the inside of a roll.  They are on their way back.  Will try another brand.	-1
This item is NOT 12" x 12". Actual size is 11 1/4" x 11 1/4". If you're looking for a 12 x 12 sheet for your 12x12 print bed, shop elsewhere.	-1
Dimensions are off. Makes a very expensive unusable piece of plastic.	-1
Update: After some extensive use and on my 2nd sheet of this Im changing this from 5star to 2star. Trying to print anything somewhat wide or long in area that also has a 1/2"+ in height will cause this sheet to rip up from the build plate (and your print from the sheet). While you *can* get some permanent 3m adhesive sheeting, that screws up your ability to shim the PEI which is required since none of these sheets are even remotely flat. I estimate variations +/- 1mm will leave you frustrated if any of your prints require precision. Theres no reason they cant make these sheets precise, the tech exists, this is just lazy manufacturing. Im going to look towards solid specialized buildplates since there is no way to have this adhere to the printbed AND be level.  ---old---- PEI works great with PETG, no heat necessary at ~75f. Its kinda hard to get up thin sheets but thicker prints you can pull right off. I used this on a robo 3d r1+ with double sided sticky tape as there is no room for clips and adhesive sheets appear to be a more permanent solution. This has allowed me to use the whole build area since heat is not needed.	-1
I purchased a sheet 1/8" thick and 12" x 24" long. This was to be cut for a bed for a 3D printer. I was very disappointed that the sheet was very warped, does not lie flat at all and impossible to correct the bowing in this. At the price I paid, which was over $100, I cannot recommend this material, if they are all warped like this.	-1
Nice, consistent 1/8" thickness, but the sheet is warped.  So much so that it bows the borosilicate glass on my 3D printer if I try to clamp it down.  Unfortunately, this piece is useless to me.	-1
Surprised to find that what I got was so lacking in tensile strength.  If I put the rod on end it will quickly bend in the middle and collapse on the floor. If you want a rigid rod this is not going to work for you at all.	-1
I thought it was just random bad luck that another reviewer got a dirty / scratched panel but mine arrived this morning and is going back this afternoon.  It was dirty with deep scratches and boot marks and some corners chipped. Totally unusable for my purposes.  Now, there is a slim possibility that everyone is getting the same panel that is being returned and then sent on to the next customer, but otherwise the factory is full of dirty panels with boot marks on them.	-1
All packed in one baggy. I like my stuff individually wrapped and sterile. I'd NEVER buy these again!!	-1
preasre buttons on all cans do not firmly attach.  not happy	-1
I cannot use this GUM flosser.  The floss just doesn't hold tightly, no matter how it's wound.  After flossing the first teeth, the floss is loose, then it must be rewound, and then it's loose.  I just can't get it to work.  I bought this for my children thinking it would make flossing easier.  They don't use it at all.  I will give it two stars, because at least I can use the floss straight out of it, but the flosser is useless for us.	-1
doesn't work. piece of crap.	-1
Don't know what to think of this device. It certainly does measure "something", not sure that it actually measures RF as it says. It has a scale for it but I did the cell phone test per the instructions and also checked my wireless router. Neither device showed any reading with the meter set on high sensitivity. It seems to pick up EMF just fine as it pegged on both the electrical meter and next to the microwave oven. We should all know by now that you don't stand close to anything with high current going through it so, is it worth $20 to verify this fact? eh....maybe.  I would like to see it register at least something from a transmitting cellphone so I know its working right? Kinda cool but seems like a toy for adults to me. Probably need to spend more to get a semi-pro level device.	-1
Is it just a coincidence that this item looks exactly like the item that is being sold as "Ghost Meter"? That one is useless for detecting EMF from a cell phone, and this one probably is just as useless.	-1
Junk. Literally have to be on signal generator to set it off.  Junk build.	-1
to fragile	-1
I bought this to attempt aiming a cell phone amplifier antenna.  It did not register at all so cheerfully returned it.	-1
We have had our Ghost investigation group now going on 30+ years, my specialty in the group is equipment & new equipment reviews & do they work or not, well this one is just about the only piece of equipment, we've ever purchased that never registered the presence of a spirit in any known haunted location where we had verified with other equipment that something was there, it just never worked, it's great in detecting your microwave or power lines or something, but to top it off, you have to plug into it and use the long wire with the sensor on the end, so it's inconvenient to carry, & none of our members ever wanted to fool with it, get a ghost meter or K-2 meter or any other cheap EMF Meter that works, but not this one, I even modified it by adding a long antenna to the sensor to give it more range, still nothing.	-1
I didn't buy this for any immediate need, rather an ongoing use as needed. I haven't had a chance to actually measure a bore yet but, It COULD earn another star if only it had instructions in English.	-1
I received a similar item. but in a blue case.  No big deal there.  However, one of the points was missing, and it was not the one that ships installed in the gauge (which was there).  Other reviewers have reported a similar issue, saying they didn't need it so it wasn't a big deal.  I didn't need it (yet) either, but I might in the future, and I paid for a complete kit.  I did not spend a ton of time analysing the quality of item.  It seems like typical overseas mediocrity, but I'm sure it would've worked well enough for me had I kept it.  Didn't bother with a replacement since this seems a common complaint and I don't want to keep wasting time.	-1
Like ink cartridges, they have us over a barrel. Without the replacement heads, one's Sonicare is useless; the price has gone up over $5 for the compact 3-pack. Anyhow, the compact bristles are about 5/8", compact for those of us with smallish mouths, and easier around the back of the molars. I'd always bang around with the standard-size brushes, giving myself a jolt and a shock. However, the standard 3-pack size is less expensive and covers more surface, I'll go back to the other size.  Update: while removing the compact brush head, it came off in two parts... just swell. Still works, but I will use a screw driver to pry off the brush head next time. Not what I expected for anything this expensive.	-1
Too small for extra large hands!	-1
OK glove, but fingers are not textured which is a definite disadvantage for me.  Otherwise, fit and finish is good and over 9 inches in length.	-1
In my opinion, these gloves are terrible. I bought them to work on my car and other light chemical work. These things constantly tear time and time again. When you try and put on a new glove after a tear it is pretty much impossible since these are not powdered and run small. The moisture on your hands keeps the glove from going on smoothly and you have to wait a minute or two for your hands to dry to put on a new glove. Maybe I got a bad batch, I don't know. I was tearing gloves just trying to put them on.  The gloves fit great and have great tactile feedback so that is a plus but I won't be buying these again anytime soon. If you are a home mechanic then I would look at a different glove. If it is other light work such as wood work, painting and staining then these will probably work well.	-1
My flexcare was only a few months out of warranty when it stopped working.  Contacted customer service and they said I couldn't send it for repair, but I could buy a new one from their on line store with a 15% discount.  When I pointed out that it was still more $ than what I could buy here on Amazon, they abruptly ended the chat session.  The guys name was Allen and I've never encountered such horrible service.  From reading the other reviews, that is their typical way of treating customers.  I'll never go back to them.	-1
As a mechanical engineer, "the little things" matter to me.  The cheesy base this comes with slides all over the counte due to the chintzy rubber "anti-skid" pads that Sonicare chose to specify in order to save 2 cents per brush.  I had some small, clear, 3M rubber pads on hand and solved the problem, after cleaning the base with rubbing alcohol.  Why should I have to do this with a toothbrush in this price level?  My original Sonicare's base remained in place for a decade.  It also used a "plastic ring design that made reinserting the brush into the charging pad a cinch. Not so with this one, which uses a relatively tiny charging "male" that inserts into the female base of the brush.  This brush offers five different brushing routines, but isn't "smart" enough to remember the last chosen setting.  Hence, it must be reset each time you brush unless the default setting is your preferred setting.  Additionally, the mode select switch (silver color) is poorly positioned and is prone to being inadvertently switched to another brushing mode during use.  A well designed brush would include a "lock" for the mode select switch, which would "remember" and lock the last setting and require 5 - 10 seconds of continuous pressing prior to being unlocked.  This brush is not a well thought out and thoroughly engineered product and I'm thinking about returning it.  People should be fired for this.	-1
I have had several of these toothbrushes both for me and for my husband. The head barely vibrates now and even when you turn it on and put it under water, it doesn't move the water. I tried turning it on and putting it on my hand. It makes noise but doesn't vibrate anymore. I called the company and they said it had turned 2 years old so I'm on my own. I have bought several of these and the vibration to clean my teeth is minimal, very disappointed especailly for the price of these. dee	-1
I tried the Sonicare and was really surprised by how powerful it is....even in the the "sensitive" setting. This just seems like too much. Saving time brushing will usually mean you are brushing too hard, and likely cause gum recession and tooth abrasion. You need to brush softly, but for between 2-3 minutes, 2-3 times/day (as well as flossing, which nothing can replace). "No pain, no gain," does NOT apply to toothbrushing. I certainly would not recommend this for your teeth. I think if they can tone it down 75%, it might actually be good. The gum "massager," mode makes no sense. Proper tooth and gingival care has more to do with the prevention of accumulation of plaque, etc., and "massaging," the gum is just a great marketing idea. I think the only people who really need to use an electric toothbrush are those with dexterity issues, etc., and they may benefit from the use of an electric toothbrush, but the trade off, e.g. recession, etc., may not be worth it. Also, you can't really try to put less pressure on it, because then it will not clean that well. I can also tell you that you will spurt toothpaste all over unless you wait to turn it on when it is in your mouth...the vibration is just that harsh. If you accidently hit your tooth with it, and you will, you will feel like there is a jackhammer in your mouth! I know there are a lot of people out there who are huge fans of these....I am not one of them. If you are still considering this item.....You only get one head, so if you want to share this (if you are a fan) you will have to spend more on another head. It does come with different colored rings so you can identify different brushes, but those rings slip around, perhaps because of the harsh vibration (I pressed pretty hard to put the two pieces together). The actual quality is very good, and it feels sturdy and not cheaply made. I just cannot recommend something that makes my teeth hurt after using it, no matter how it feels, or how cool it looks (and it does look pretty cool and hi-tech). For about two-three percent of the cost of the Sonicare (and no operating cost) you can have a superior instrument to keep your teeth and gums healthy.	-1
Okay, let me start by saying that the H681 is a sound piece of equipment.  The volume is great and the sound quality is pretty good and I've put several hours on the thing without incident (technologically speaking).  The power switch is also easily accessible while wearing this and the volume controls (though they initially felt backwards to me) are easy to access and press simultaneously for call waiting.  However.  The usability for this headset is completely DESTROYED by the fact that there is no way to swivel the piece to point toward (or at least parallel to) your cheek.  So unless it fits you perfectly from go, you are going to have problems.  Not only will you look like a d-bag for wearing one of these things in most contexts, but you will look like a COMPLETE TOOL because the thing wanders away from your face and sticks out away from your head!  It looks totally ridiculous and is even more frustrating when you throw a pair of glasses or sunglasses into the equation.  Look forward to pushing this thing back toward your head every time you want to make a call.  The simple fact is, instead of making a somewhat adjustable piece to go over the ear, they made it out of a solid straw of plastic.  And that, my friends, has compelled me to go buy one that is more adjustable.  It's a terrible waste, considering the quality of the headset otherwise seems very good.	-1
Returned this because I didn't like that the pressure pad had to always be pushed to have the light on.	-1
I struggled with the strap arrangement, especially the "safety" strap. It's too short The rear strap slips off the back of the motor. The handle sits so close to the motor top, I can barely get fingers under it. Some metal lifting ring or hook would surely slice up the paint on the top. Good idea I suppose but it did not work for a brand new Merc 8hp 4 stroke motor.	-1
Giving this 1 star because a slightly heavier model is available at my local Home Depot for < $4. I would suggest looking locally for a 2 gal pail since the price/quality of this item is pretty high.  Why did I get this from Amazon? Well I thought for $10 it would be a great heavy duty pail (kind of like the ones I could purchase several years ago).	-1
Best price for store quality filters! And you get so many (8)!  (on first order at least) But if you reorder they only ship you ONE instead of 8 at the same price.  I used the option of "Buy Again", which should have duplicated my order previously where they sold a qty of 8 filters per package for $11.87, so I ordered two packages expecting to receive a total of 16, but only got TWO filters.	-1
not worth buying, made in china, the needle was broke off when i opened the package.  save your money & buy a brown& sharpe when you can afford it.	-1
cheap Chinese product. When you crimp the ends on your wires they pull apart easy...buy better quality..American if you can find it....	-1
came off in a week  wast of my time and money	-1
First off you get what you pay for, maybe. Not even sure at this price it was worth it. Cheap plastic pieces, ear pieces that feel like a bear trap. By bending out the piece of spring "steel" it was made bearable. For occasional use, a few times a year these might suffice. The plastic end pieces were not finished off and had tabs that needed to be cut off. Everything is crammed into a flimsy box. Would not recommend to anyone that wants anything with any quality at all.	-1
Review for:  Lutron 822-A Fully Digital EMF Meter  OVERVIEW: -----------  Measures EMF strength of low frequency (30Hz-300Hz in this case) portion of AC MAGNETIC FIELD (NOT AC electric field, too) from ONE AXIS (direction) in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT).  Because cell phones and microwaves are in a much higher frequency range, this product does not measure EMF (RF) at those frequencies.  You would want a separate meter for that.  The Achilles Heal of this instrument is that the design is HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings. The accuracy is not 4% of the displayed value (+ 3 digits) but rather THE ACCURACY IS % OF THE VALUE OF THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT RANGE (4%x200mG = +/-8mG (+ 3 digits).  Since most consumer EMF checking is in the single and low teens mG, this is unfortunate.  This will do fine for noting the EXISTENCE of stronger EMF at lower frequencies, but appears to be a highly inaccurate choice for MEASURING it.  MAIN VALUE: ------------  - Measures EMF at 30Hz-300Hz low frequency range (Magnetic AC field only, not Electric AC Field), which covers most EMF generated by AC power in most homes/offices.  60Hz (U.S.) and much of the EMF generated by resulting harmonic frequencies .. 120Hz (2nd harmonic), 180Hz (3rd), 240Hz (4th), 300Hz (5th).  CONS: ------  - HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings .. a fixed +/- 8.3 milligauss (mG).  Since most suggested defensive limits for extended exposure are 1mG-2mG or so, this greatly limits its utility.  See paragraph above under "The Achilles Heal of this instrument.." for more detail.  - Measures only AC magnetic field (mG/uT), NOT AC ELECTRIC FIELD (V/m,mW/cm2, etc.).  Adding electric field measurement with decent accuracy would have added greatly to the cost.  NOTES: -------  - Like other meters anywhere near this price range, the company doesn't claim this unit will filter out <30Hz and >300MHz EMF as well as academic/professional units like the Enertech Emdex II filters out EMF from outside its measurement range.  - This frequency range does not cover cell phones or cordless phone signals, microwave oven radiation, or other high frequencies often referred to as RF (radio frequency).  SAMPLE EMF MEASUREMENTS: -----------------------------  There is no definitive consensus nor clear epidemiological evidence yet as to how much milligauss (mG) for extended periods could be harmful (within reasonable home/office real world levels).  However, there is a consensus from studies that staying under 1mG-4mG would be a good defensive strategy in case 20-40 years from now longer term studies (think smoking, etc.) start showing stronger causal relationships.  Most folks who care about this aim for under 2mG, preferably under 1mG, especially where pacemakers can be involved.  Here are some sample readings of LOW frequency AC MAGNETIC field EMF (Note: not electric field):  (1) Alarm Clock 3"  25mG 6"  10mG 1'  3mG 1.5'  1.8mG 2'  0.5mG  (2) Microwave Oven #1 (Home) Towards decent seal: 6"  10-30mG 1'  4-25mG 2'  1.5-5mG Towards questionable seal: 6"  160mG 1'  45mG 2'  15mG  (3) Microwave Oven #2 (Office) 6"  50mG 1'  20mG 2'  3mG 3'  1.2mG  (4) CRT Television (20" Sony WEGA) Down the middle: 6"  0.9mG 1'  0.5mG 2'  0.2mG Corners: 6"  5.5mG 1'  3mG 2'  0.7mG Sides/Edges in the middle vertically: 6"  7mG 1'  3.5mG 2'  0.9mG  (5) 2012 LED Television 3"  0.6mG  (6) Dehumidifier (Large 70pt.

Unlike higher frequencies where magnetic and electric fields are strongly coupled together, at lower frequencies you measure them separately.  As noted elsewhere in the review, for biological exposure it is suggested to play defense and keep prolonged exposure from lower frequency Magnetic Fields to under 1-4 mG (preferably under 1-2 mG) but there is no definitive consensus as to the long term biological dangers, and where the safety lines are.  Regarding Electric Fields of 50-60Hz (AC Power), there is some rough consensus out there to keep below 10-20 V/m and sleep at a spot below 5 V/m, though again opinions vary.  5 V/m was the recommendation in Germany and by the IRPA/INIRC for "private individuals", 10 V/m for "workers", with 25 V/m for "workers" for max. 2 hours.  ACGIH recommend 1 V/m for those with pacemakers or other electrically sensitive implants.  The fields in the lower frequency ranges are sometimes referred to as ELF (see chart below for usual acronym meanings of this sort), or even confusingly as EMF which is also often used to define such fields at most frequencies.  EMF(RF) FROM HIGHER FREQUENCIES:  At HIGH FREQUENCIES like those the high frequency meters measure, the magnetic and electric fields are coupled so strongly together that it is one field that is measured, usually in V/m or mW/cm2, etc.  For microwave ovens (2.45 GHz) biological exposure is often recommended to not exceed 5 mW/cm2 (milliwatts per cm squared), however again opinions vary.  Some school or hospital exposure limits for 300MHz-300GHz: - France, Italy 10 mW/cm2 in schools - Switzerland 9.5 mW/cm2 in schools, 4.25 mW/cm2 in hospitals - Belgium, Luxembourg 2.4 mW/cm2  For RF Fields of 900MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 4.5W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.  For RF Fields of 1800MHz, exposure limit recommendations around the world appear to range from .001W/m2 to 9W/m2, the latter being in Germany and the ICNIRP recommendation in '98.  The higher frequencies are often referred to as RF (radio frequency) frequencies (think cell phones, microwaves, etc.) and thus you'll see some meters with "RF" in the title or description.  MAGNETIC VS. ELECTRIC FIELD MEASUREMENT:  AC MAGNETIC FIELDS are much harder to shield than electric fields.  On the other hand unperturbed AC ELECTRIC FIELDS are much harder to measure accurately/dependably than Magnetic fields.  IEEE tries to help with IEEE 644-1994.  The inexpensive models don't pretend to measure this as well as the Enertech Emdex II's of the world, however they are often much less expensive and there's your trade-off.  Note that AC ELECTRIC FIELDS often remain as long as the the source is plugged in, whether it is turned on or off.  So for biological concern, what do people care about, magnetic or electric fields?  An engineer in the field that has been following this noted that in the 70's it was electric fields, in the late 70's and 80's it was magnetic fields, and now it's really both.  Most inexpensive units are only good for detecting the PRESENCE of stronger fields (vs. measuring them well) and many only measure magnetic fields, and if they do measure electric fields it usually isn't accurate.  If you need to measure accurately and/or measure both magnetic and electric fields, I try to help out in this review with some leads later on.  GENERAL:  Meters not designed for it avoid 0Hz since that is the natural ground DC static field and we usually want to ignore that for measurement.  Also there is often comparatively little EMF produced 1Hz-40Hz (some European train systems do FYI - 16.7Hz).  Thus meters often aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover below 30Hz-40Hz.  The frequency range of 30Hz/40Hz to 300Hz usually covers much of low frequency EMF produced in a home or office.  This includes the U.S. 60 Hz AC power frequency and 4 of the harmonic frequencies from that.  Thus we usually aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover over a few hundred Hz or so.  However, note that capping the upper end of the low frequencies in the low hundreds may fail to capture a good portion of CFL's EMF (compact fluorescent lights) if that is important to you.  Note that measured values can become less trustworthy as you get very close to the source of an EMF field, so measuring practically next to the source is often questionable.  Also note that pulsed EMF is usually not read accurately by EMF meters.  Note that if you need to take high radar frequency field strength into account (think Traffic Control Radar, Aviation, Naval, Military) because say you live near an airport and are wondering .. you'll probably need a meter that reads in the 8.5GHz-9.5GHz range.  Note:  I can't imagine who might work so close to one, but keep CFL bulbs without specific UVB and UVC mitigation (think double-envelope eco bulbs, for example) more than 20cm/8" from people at the bare minimum.  If you don't know the technology of your CFL bulb, might as well play defense.  FREQUENCY USE LEGEND: -------------------------  - Static Field = 0Hz - Some European electric rail = 16.7Hz - Amtrak electric wire driven trains in U.S. southern NE corridor = 25Hz - AC Power for home/business (much of Europe) = 50Hz - AC Power for home/business(U.S.) = 60Hz - U.S. AC Power natural harmonics = 120Hz, 180Hz, 240Hz, 300Hz, 360Hz.. up to 800Hz for most. - 2Hz-100KHz includes many energy saving lamps, switching-mode power supplies, electronic dimmers, and monitors. - Some specialty small/light/fast motors (some server rooms, aircraft, ships, some power tools, etc.) = 400Hz - RF Animal Identification = 125KHz(U.S.) and 134.2KHz(Intl) (penetrates mud, blood, water) - Dect 6.0 cordless phone (most secure, least conflict) = 1.9GHz - Other cordless phones = 900MHz, 2.45GHz, 5.8GHz - WiFi (802.11) = 2.45GHz or 5GHz - Bluetooth = 2.45GHz - Many radio control cars, planes, etc. = 2.45GHz - RFID (Radio Frequency Identification ..

IRPA - International Radiation Protection Association SCENIHR - Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (European Union advisory group). INIRC - International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee ICNIRP - International Commission on Nonionizing Radiation Protection WHO - World Health Organization International EMF Project U.S. EMF RAPID Program - 6 year working group put together in the past by NIEHS, NIH, and DOE. NRC/NAS - National Research Council / National Academy of Sciences by way of National Academy Press CA Dept. of Health Services - CA EMF Program IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers VDB - Association of German Building Biologists (Verband Deutscher Baubiologen)  Further future related research discoveries are likely to involve, or at least be reported on, by one or more of these organizations as they have been involved in such research in the past (much of it you can find on the web).  HOW TO GET 3D READINGS FROM FROM 3 XYZ AXES METER READINGS: ------------------------------------  While some tools take "3D" readings, to save money some folks buy meters that read 1 or 3 individual axes, not a composite "3D" reading.  To make a "3D" reading out of the individual axes readings you are supposed to put each of the three axis meter readings into the equation "square root (x-squared + y-squared + z-squared)".  However, here are some short-cut estimations for less demanding needs that some use:  Measurement Value:......Corresponding Guesstimate 1 High, 2 Low values....Use highest value 2 High, 1 Low value.....Use highest value plus half of second highest 3 similar values........Use 1.5x highest value  MEASURING SUGGESTIONS: --------------------------  Consider/test: - Keeping unit over 1ft away from any conductive material like metals. - Putting unit on a non-conductive holder like dry wood or cardboard. - Reading meter from 5 feet away. - If measuring over a bed, measuring 2" above mattress to take pillow into account and lessen the measurement effect of the springs (if there are any, of course).  SOME OTHER METERS: ----------------------  If looking for a high-end, accurate low frequency EMF meter, consider starting your research with these:  (1) ENERTECH EMDEX II   Measures AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields in the 40Hz-800Hz range, 3-axis, 1-2% of value accuracy.  Sold to power companies and universities in 50+ countries, this is a leading industry tool.  It also has recording, event marking, and software capabilities consistent with the needs of consultants.  It is also excellent at filtering out EMF outside 40Hz-800Hz and is unusually accurate in reading AC Electric Field. ($2,950 for base unit)  (2) GIGAHERTZ SOLUTIONS meters   Made in Germany, sold in North America through Safe Living Technologies, Gigahertz Solutions has a wide variety of accurate affordable models that cover many frequency ranges priced from under two hundred to over a thousand dollars.  Here are some of them, all these listed have HIGH ACCURACY and measure both AC MAGNETIC and AC ELECTRIC fields: 3030B 16Hz-2KHz ($175) This model is a value sweet spot for non-professionals, offering most of everything one is looking for in accurately low frequency magnetic and electric fields. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ME3030B-Electromagnetic-Field-Meter/dp/B003A5R59G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ME3030B Electromagnetic Field Meter</a> 3830B 16Hz-100KHz ($270) This model extends the frequency range to include a range sometimes controversially referred to as dirty electricity.

To measure EMF/RF field strengths AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES you will need a spectrum analyzer.  Some consultants use these for higher-end analyses, however there is usually much more expense and skill involved clearly.  Below is the maker of an affordable hand held spectrum analyzer solution you may wish to read up on..  (3) Aaronia AG Spectran handheld spectrum analyzer I suggest reviewing their website for model options if considering these, there is a variety of models and bundles covering different frequency ranges, covering both AC Magnetic and AC Electric Fields.  The U.S. Distributor is Kaltman Creations (Aaronia AG is in Germany). - Low Frequency Range Examples: Aaronia AG Spectran NF-1010E (10Hz-10KHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields, 5% accuracy) <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NF-1010E-AARONIA-Handheld-Spectrum-Analyzer-10Hz-10KHz/dp/B00B66KIZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NF-1010E AARONIA Handheld Spectrum Analyzer (10Hz - 10KHz)</a> Aaronia AG Spectran NF-3020 (10Hz-400KHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields 5% accuracy) <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NF-3020-AARONIA-Handheld-Spectrum-Analyzer-10Hz-400KHz/dp/B00B6WUICG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NF-3020 AARONIA Handheld Spectrum Analyzer (10Hz - 400KHz)</a> Aaronia AG Spectran NF-5030 (1Hz-1MHz, Magnetic and Electric Fields, 3% accuracy) [Couldn't find on Amazon]  (4) If you are considering spectrum analyzers and money isn't much of an issue you might consider reviewing Tektronix, HP, and Agilent offerings, too, perhaps others, just to know what's out there at the high-end if nothing else.  Of course, for most folks this is way out of budget and often skill set.  I hope this helps some folks serious about EMF/RF measuring get started.	-1

I searched for a "geiger counter" and this showed-up (along with other unrelated stuff.)  I can only assume that "geiger counter" is hidden somewhere so the search finds it but does not show-up in the text.  This may be a deception but just to be sure, this does not detect radioactive material.	-1
DUMB! The wheels are all drilled so you can only put certain wheels on certain ends of the gearbox. So the wheels with the locks can only go in a certain direction on a certain side of the gearbox. And if you want to put it anywhere else you are going to be in trouble. Personally I ended up yelling at Whirlpool and Gladiator for a while. Then on one end used a single bolt & some epoxy to insure they would stay put. Either way, I'm furious that Gladiator forces your hand in how you align the wheels. Why would I want fixed wheels closest to the front doors of the cart? I want them on a skinny end so I can slide the cart out of the way when not in use. okay rant done. stupid.	-1
A sensor designed for an alarm system. It does not have an alarm and cannot work independantly. I bought it thinking it was a heat alarm and found it works only with an alarm system. Contacted the company, but they do not pay for return shipping. I guess I will donate it to someone as the return shipping cost is about the cost of the item.	-1
The accuracy of these is fine.  However there are scores of other calipers that are also accurate.  The digital display is too small and has poor contrast - reminds me of the first Casio digital watch I owned in the 1970's.  Times have changed and an 8 mm digit size doesn't cut it anymore.  The mushy buttons are nothing special - buttons with a positive tactile click are preferred these days.  The resistance to sliding is quite high - not as easy as the newer competing units.  Not a big deal maybe, but it imparts a low quality impression.  In summary, its like this product has not been updated in the past 40 years.  There's no reason to buy these except possibly for museum curators who need to complete their "measuring instruments of the 1970's"  collection.	-1
In spite of a review from Nov. 2012, the size has not been corrected. Mine measured 86mm x 11mm. I think we should be able to expect a truthful description from a seller, especially since it has been pointed out before. My uses were non-scientific so the size difference didn't make much difference for my uses, but if they are said to be 100 x 15mm, then that is what I expect.	-1

The mirror breaks very easily. The manufacturer wants $13.38 to send me the k-2R replacement mirror. There is no sheath or protective guard provided to prevent breakage. I believe this is intentional, to generate extra revenue from replacement mirror sales.  A really borderline business plan.  I would give it 5 stars, otherwise, because it is a good product to use. Just easy to break and expensive to replace the mirror.  Staples is a better place to buy this. They will have a whole new K-2 for you to pick up at their store for $6.99.	-1

I was only able to to try it on the one device I needed it to work for (digital coax out of the TV to an optical in on a soundbar).  It didn't work, despite the fact that all 3 optical cables I tried (one very basic black plastic one, one more flexible plastic, and one glass) had red light coming out of it, and all three cables work in other applications.  Dunno if I got a dud or not, but it wasn't worth the hassle of returning.	-1

Philips is so CHEAP !  This company sells the 2-brush set with only one - count it, one - recharging base.  So your family member with whom you share the bathroom has to remember to remove your brush from the stand and put their brush, each day, or  some such arrangement.  How Stupid, how lazy, how cheap!  Philips writes in the manual that comes with this thing that one should not use the recharging base from an other model with this unit.  I had another, older unit.  Of course the new brush was purposely made not to fit the old recharger -- planned obsolescence.  But I got it to fit by expanding the base.  I heated it with a hot air dryer and pushed the somewhat softened plastic of the bas outward to make room for the slightly larger base of the new brush.  That, plus a bit of scraping.  Teach Philips a lesson and buy another brand!	-1
I bought this toothpaste because of the flavor - and it is very good for toothpaste. I can't recommend this though for several reasons: the box promises to freshen your breath with Scope and to whiten your teeth. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually do either of those things plus you get a lot less than a normal toothpaste.  The "Scope" part of the gel immediately liquefies once in your mouth instantly cutting the gel on your brush in half. The very small amount of "Scope" isn't enough to freshen your breath for more than a few minutes after brushing. Plus, since we lose about half of the gel in the tube, we are effectively buying half the toothpaste, as that of a standard competitor 6 ounce size, for the same cost (or more - this same toothpaste is available at Wal-Mart for about $2).  The "whitening" claim is also misleading as the whitening that you and I think of when we buy toothpaste is an additional chemical that works to lighten the color of our teeth. The "whitening" that Crest is talking about, though, is the same you would get from rubbing any toothpaste on your teeth: the toothpaste in conjunction with your brush helps scrub the stains off the enamel of your teeth. Crest isn't the only company to do this. I recently went down the aisle at a local store and found that most of the toothpastes advertising "whitening" have in small print that they scrub your teeth of surface stains, i.e., they clean your teeth not actually whiten them.	-1
I hate this bag.  It is very difficult to fill you have to hold it open while balancing a container to fill from.  It is awkward to hang. You have to cut out a hole to hang and the material around it is flimsy.  The tubing is very stiff and the shut off device even stiffer.  It takes two hands and a lot of pressure to shut off.  This is nearly impossible if you have arthritis in your hands.  There are much better disposable bags on the market. I will not order these again.	-1

Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.	-1
these terminals are not as heavy duty as those purchase from HomeDepot, although they are rated the same. Really worried about if these can hold up the same amount of electric current. Easily deformed when crimping to wires, easily loosen up after crimping. The metal material is too thin to hold the shape.	-1

Thought these were comparable to those in the auto parts store but after trying them, they are not. The internal metal is not sturdy enough to hold the crimp on the wire. Just a slight tug and the wire becomes loose, another slight tug and it will pull right out. I had a few of these come apart when trying to disconnect them from switches. When you grab the blue part to pull it off the corresponding blade, the blue part and the wire come off but the metal part stays connected. I do not recommend these connectors.	-1

I bought a hundred of the male and female connectors. These things are terrible. The metal is way to thin and will not grip heavy copper like 10 to 12 gauge as it's meant to.

Very poor quality. I have 40 years in the electronics industry. Keep in mind the color. Yellow is for heavy gauge wire such as 12 gauge. The metal that you crimp on to the copper is so thin it will not hold the wire correctly. I used three types of crimps, all worked terrible. Don't buy.	-1

These terminals seem to be well made for the price, however they do not function well.  Once connected, the male and female "quick disconnects" are nearly impossible to pull apart. I had to use a vise and pliers to get them apart.  I ordered these with the intention of having something that I could quickly disconnect, but these do not fit the bill.  If you are only going to make a connection with these and do not plan to ever disconnect them, then I would say buy them. If you need to be able to pull them apart then get something else like a bullet connector.	-1
These are cheaply made terminals that do not crimp well, even with a quality Greenlee ratcheting terminal crimper.	-1
Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.	-1
I used this to glue some insulation to my garage door.  The insulation is thin, smooth and light.  I figured it would stick well, but much of it has come off. It's probably because the sun hits the garage door and warms it up.  But it's not like the garage door gets that hot from the morning sun here in Virginia.	-1
How can people be promoting this glue like this? People are becoming ILL from using this. Plus, it does not work very well! I have used this glue on crystal, metal, plastic and glass. It can easily be pulled apart by a child. --Even though, it should NEVER BE USED IN A HOME WITH CHILDREN! .. Please, please, use something else!!! Otherwise, use a respirator. There are other reviewers who say they use a respirator (not just a simple fume mask. A respirator.) ..But why use something that requires a respirator?! .. Please use something else.  Good luck, friends. I hope that you can find an alternative. Two-part epoxies are waaaay better, by the way! "Devcon 2-Ton" is clear and is is waaaay stronger, with just about no small at all.	-1
Easily crushed and split especially when cold. I was kidding myself that an 18" flexible cone would stop city slickers from parking on my lot. The only way these cones would deter illegal parking would be to fire them out of a bazooka at the jerks.	-1
I tried to save some money and got stuck with these. They are harder than the usual to use and they smell like freshly made plastic. Oooo! I do not like that. I wish I paid a little more and got a better bag.	-1
Made my mouth hurt	-1
Shame on you AMAZON!  This toothpaste is wonderful , and probably becoming quite popular. That is still NOT a reason to jack the price up from about 12 to 34 dollars.  NO WAY I'll pay that price, to you or anybody.  Once again, SHAME ON YOU!	-1
Too watery. I was expecting a gel.	-1
This is not the best epoxy for reef tanks. The glue is very runny and comes off the frag plug while in the water. A few of my fish tried to eat it since it was floating in the water. That was very bad for the fish. Also this epoxy is not very strong, the red leg hermits pop the frags of the rock since the epoxy is not very strong.	-1
A week after I bought this tank, the Hoover quit working. Threw it all in the garbage.	-1
Rolls nicely, was easy to assemble. My only gripe is that the blue mat is super thin and already destroyed after a day and a half of light use.  So now it looks like crap but it still functions just fine.	-1
I really only wanted the small basket, but since they're only sold as a set I thought maybe I could use the other 2 for something else. When I opened the box to view its contents I was simultaneously amazed and disappointed, amazed at how they work and disappointed at how poorly constructed they are. It's one thing to use thin plastic, but these are so thin that I'm doubtful of their durability. By comparison I have a file hanging plastic box from Rubbermaid that holds about 1000 sheets of paper and I can carry it around without worrying about the paper falling out the bottom. Additionally, although the plastic of these baskets is PP they emit a strange smell that hasn't gone away completely after 2 days of fresh air in my home.  The large basket by virtue of its immense size is not sturdy enough to hold heavy items. The bottom bows out, as does the medium basket, though not as bad. The small basket is the sturdiest of them all, but the poor construction of all the baskets severely limits their usefulness. What I'm most disappointed about is how the individual pieces are connected. The handles have tabs that look like a glob of hardened plastic; they're not uniform in shape, but the holes in the frame itself aren't even round; they look like they were haphazardly burned in with a soldering iron or something that they're too big & the handles thus loose. The same goes for the folding sides, which I noticed because one of the sides just fell out. Upon closer inspection of the tab and the hole I discovered that the holes are malformed. If that's not bad enough, the plastic in several areas look like they were cut by wire cutters so they're not smooth. The edge of some of the side hinges are damaged that they don't properly hook onto the other side at the corners.  Plastic clippings trash and plastic chemical fumes can't be good for the health and environment of the Chinese workers who have to endure this hazardous work so that Americans can enjoy convenience. I'll just use them till they break and try to find a proper way to recycle them. I recommend that you don't buy these at all.	-1
It came apart after it arrived.  The pieces seem to come from different skulls...  So many skulls to choose from in China, probably got them mixed up at "Body Parts Factory #46"	-1
Epoxy failed to fully harden and turned yellow within days from sun.  If you have white countertops that are exposed to the sun, do not use this product.	-1
Product was likely over shelf life.  Would have returned but it wasn't enough money.  Vendor likely was unaware the product had problems....	-1
Bought two, one was DOA. It always thinks it night time	-1
This photo-sensor worked fantastic... but only for three months.  The internal relay is now sticking in the off position, and will no longer turn on at night unless I reach up and thwack it with a broom handle.  Ordered the Tork 2001 today instead, let's hope it lasts longer.  :(	-1
I am still (6 months later) trying to figure out just what I am measuring.  The documentation is terrible or perhaps it's me, but I'm finding it difficult to make sense of the readings this meter produces.  I hardlly use it at all anymore mainly because it's too difficult to figure out which buttons in which sequence give you the measurement you are looking for.	-1
One can hear well but because the head is too loose, it flip flops to one side to another. I will not buy again.	-1
Disc are not very good--about what you get at Harbor Freight. Not seller's fault but you get what you pay for. Eac disc lasts about 15 minutes cleaning up angle iron to weld.	-1
Decent CPR mask. ? counterfeits.  Case is EXTREMELY large. be aware!  For the price, it was worth to have just in case!	-1
I  gave it 2 stars because it will do what it needs to do, but that's it. The plastic is thin, stiff and getting a good seal will take some force.	-1
MUCH too round...bulky to the point of being in the way wherever one puts this large can. No lid, no wheels and hard to cart around when full. I wound-up getting another one which was more narrow, rectangular and which had wheels. This was far too expensive for something without a lid or wheels. I can't use this one, and it is going to be donated to a recycling center.	-1
came with missing sliders, broken pieces although box not damaged, looks really cheap. Ok for a kids room. Not durable enough for tools, flimsy. Wish I'd bought the metal version for $10 more. I would not buy this again or recommend it.	-1
The pictures were the older style smooth can, which we wanted. When received, they were the newer design with ridges, and are harder to clean.	-1
the Rubbermaid trash can is great and a rubber type of material with a dull red finish this lid however is a shiny plastic so i really don't think it will last as long as the can will.	-1
The sticker on the top that says "peel here" doesn't come off.  When peeling I had to scratch it off and now the lid looks like hell.  Thanks a lot!	-1
I ordered three of these since I needed something 10gallon size.  I'm barely willing to keep them since they actually do hold what I need to put in them.  I expected the commercial grade brute cans, even the 10 gallon, to be stronger than this.  The plastic is thin, and the can is easily deformed.  Amazon screwed up as well, since the box they packed them in was too shallow, and the rims were compressed out of round.  Sitting empty for two days, they didn't return to round, I had to press them back into shape.  Pretty pathetic considering I have several other old rubbermaid trashcans that hold their shape no matter what you do to them.  And when the lids finally arrived, they don't even fit well.  Sure they cover the can, and yes, they 'lock' into place below the handles.  But the rest of the lid is loose, and not even down tight to completely close the can.  Commercial? food grade?  They can only be refering to the formula for the plastic, since the construction itself is barely acceptable for general use.  If you want to keep things out of the can, you'll have to put a weight on the lid, forget trying to seal it.	-1
collects water. bad in Florida for breeding mosquitoes.	-1
I have a number of these with the trash cans, in different colors. The lids do not securely attach to the trash cans and the raccoons bite through these very easily.	-1
I ordered one of these for a 32 gallon can I was getting.  Soon realized as I looked at it, that it was perfectly flat, so wouldn't allow rain or snow to slide off it, and I expect ice would probably crack it at some time in the future.  I returned it for another, on my dime I might add, and got a domed version to fit the can.	-1
cheap chinese. poor quality. just by having it in your hand you can tell it aint worth it.	-1
Manufacturer didn't include the handle. Nor did they include any information on how to contact them. As usual, Amazon is useless and will only let you return the entire thing.	-1
I have used a different but similar cart for years, and the bed finally split.  I don't like one wheeled wheelbarrows, because the load is high and they are easy to tip.  I see no reason to spend any more than the $50 this one costs.  1. The floor is not flat, as my old unit was, to make it easier to mix the load with a shovel.  However, it seems that the flat plastic floor style of my old unit is not as strong as this style of plastic, and this style also makes a narrower cart, which is easier to get through some spots. Unlike the old cart, I don't see any areas that are weak by design. I figured that I should be able to get at least as many years out of this cart (5 or more).  Unfortunately I got less than 1 year. 2.  These wheels are large enough to roll easily, although not as large as my old cart.  I did not want tires that pump up--my experience with those is that eventually they don't hold air anymore. That style is expensive to replace or repair.  The wheels on the old cart are still good, and I estimate that these will be good for some years to come. 3.  The cart dumps well, and the walls are higher than most.  It lists a 200 pound capacity.  Unless you are a 27 year old weight lifter or farmer, you probably won't want to carry more than 120 pounds in a cart anyway.  It does not bend when I dump 40 pound loads at a time into it.  If you need to move more than this, buy a $250 steel and wood wheelbarrow.	-1
Comes off the mattress when pulling up draw sheets. Not worth it.	-1
Looks like it's made from recycled rags. You could not find lower quality material if you tried. It is knitted. The elastic edge keeps it on the mattress well enough.	-1
Defective products  Funai has terrible customer service and Amazon just passed the buck when the digital date switch caused the product to not be needed in the original time frame. FYI: Philco no longer exists as a company  just a former brand name Funai uses to fool the public into buying substandard crap	-1
My offices required us to get several converter boxes, and this is by far he worst of them. It lacks even the most basic features such as a volume control for the television. If you buy this box, you'll need two remotes to control the volume and channels on your TV unless you have a universal remote that will actually work with it. The box itself can't function without the remote either. You can't even turn it on and off without the remote because the box has zero controls on it. It's performance is fair at best too. This box is so poor, we replaced it with the Tivax STB-T8, which has more features, costs less, and performs better. We also have several Zenith DTT901's, which also performs circles around this hunk of junk. I rarely give an item 1 star, but this box deserves it.	-1
The diameter of the pipe is not the same as good blowers.	-1
There is a permanently marked label right on the front to tell you where to re order more signs.  Its prominent, right under the word 'surveillance'. I'm giving this otherwise alright product one star because the photo i looked at of it to buy it did not show the big reorder information.  I'm tired of subtle false advertising and tricks.  Just be honest and show the real picture.  How am i supposed to remove this silkscreened permanent ink? Acetone would dissolve the plastic enough to leave a streak.	-1
The sticky backing for these was weak.  Depending on what you are putting them on, you might need to apply some glue, if the situation allows for it.	-1
I received this item in gray color instead of black, which is very disappointing. It does not match my fixtures color.	-1
returned did not fit	-1
It's a phony.	-1
Way overpriced, I don't notice a difference.	-1
This product was just okay. I only used ita. Short time. It didn't stand up easily in the charger and wasn't convenient  to keep on sink. Oh we'll.	-1
I've gotten more stickiness from a clamy handshake.  It's not tape, it's vinyl with hot breath on it. No stick	-1
not the gaffers tape im used to, plastic finish does not conform well and the adhesive is hardly up to snuff	-1
This is not gaffer's tape. It's not duct tape either. It surprises me that Hosa, a very dependable company, would sell this crap. It cannot be pulled tightly without breaking, and it does leave a slight residue when removed. Don't buy it - it's junk. The stuff you want, for a couple bucks more, is right here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GZE3UJ8/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 or search for "Gaffer power professional premium grade gaffer tape".	-1
Not really gaffer's tape, cheap imitation. Stick with the other name brands. This leaves residue on whatever you stick it to. And it's not a cloth tape like the real stuff, it's more like a vinyl tape of some sort.	-1
Boy I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this!  This is *not* cloth gaff tape.  It acts like not very sticky cold duct tape.  I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I'll use it as a door stop or something.  I will not buy again.	-1
Not that much helpful than I expected since the depth of guide is kind of short and not really functioning as a guider. I feel like it's kind of better than nothing but nothing more than that!	-1
This is NOT the original product by SuperSiphon as claimed on the listing.  It is a knockoff "Super Easy Siphon Hose".  Not sure there is any difference and not sure I will keep it yet, just warning everyone to watch out, this is not the "as seen on TV" product.	-1
Bought the identical "Hopkins" version and it did not work... I was trying to transfer stale gasoline from an (elevated) generator to a fuel can on the floor, but the vinyl tube kept filling with air, causing the fuel flow to stop immediately after shaking. I tried this for about 30 minutes but could not get it to suck up the fuel fast enough to keep it flowing without continually shaking. Also there needs to be several inches of fluid in the source container to get it to suck up any at all.	-1
I have a few of these and I intended to used them for multiple purposes. Once for gas.....not good,and once for water.....also not good. Not a chance in hell these work like they should. I got a few cheap and thats probably why. One set came with a coupler to join extention hoses to it but of course it simply popped out and not worth the effort. If I could meaure the amount of liquid that they "filtered" I would say about 1 gallon in 5 hours. I know what I'm doing but you can't make a crummy product work if it's designed poorly.	-1
I bought and tried this on my heavy duty garden hose...did not stop the leak at all!  Waste of money for sure.  Do not buy this product.	-1
I used 3 rolls and applied as directed and none of them held. Spent $30.00 for nothing. Don't buy.	-1
Didn't stop the leak, and I wrapped it so tight the pipe was flexing.	-1
Tried to use this on a leaking 1" copper sweat joint.  Did not work!	-1
Causes more problems than fixes.	-1
I used this on a leaking garden hose and it didn't work. It may have some other uses but don't count on it to fix a leaking hose. It does stick to itself though so conceivably there is a use for it. I just haven't found it yet.	-1
Very deceitful ad It shows six rolls of tape and when you get the product there is only one. The picture is the only description and so you believe it to be accurate. Especially since there is no way to select the color, I guess they just send whatever is the least popular color. I got Orange. Useless  Very disappointed with fraudulent seller.	-1
do not buy. waste of money. you get a tiny amount, and i wrapped the hell out of a garden hose coupling, even tried it twice, with no success.  still leaks.  so, don't expect a miracle.	-1

Good contact cement for the price. Works best with non-porous materials. It affects rubber causing it to curl. Directions recommend having materials to be bonded at 65 degrees or more for 24 hours before bonding and for another 72 hours after bonding. I found this a pain as i wanted outside air exchange with the air in my shop to minimize the fumes from the cement.  The work pieces really do need to be clamped with uniform pressure to get good adhesion. I used all my clamps to achieve this and ended up cutting boards to size for use when clamping the pieces to be bonded.  Holding power with neoprene and with rubber bonded to aluminum sheet was not impressive. I had to redo all the edges using VHB tape.	-1
Wasn't able to use because it wasn't exactly the color I needed but that was my fault.  The packaging says 3M, but it sure doesn't look and feel like the 3M quality I'm use to.  I did try a small piece of it and it seemed to tear very easy which made me question the durability.	-1
Update: 5 star down to 1 star! Contacted ARB Australia and USA for clarification. This block is for 10,000 lb winches not 17,000 lbs. it would be VERY dangerous to use it with a 17, or 18,000 winch as implied by the use of 1/2" line. quote from description today says: "Suitable for up to 1/2" rope or cable. For use with winches up to 17,000 lbs. including the Warn 16.5 ti." COMPLETELY WRONG AND DANGEROUS. My original review:  "It looks real nice, handles 1/2" synthetic or Steel cable - that was key for me. I really like the simple functional opening design. I haven't actually loaded it up but will update review when I do."	-1
PRO:  1.  Arrived on time. 2.  Works as advertised. 3.  Has dual language stickers. 4.  Bright red and two lock holes in case two people want to lock out at the same / different times.  CON: 1.  Plastic, let me say that again, it's PLASTIC! 2.  If using for SECURITY reasons, this can be broken off easy. 3.  Any padlock can be twisted and break this PLASTIC device off easy. 4.  It "binds" on itself when you try to use it.  OTHER: 1.  It's plastic.  So once this breaks by someone trying to steal water from me, I'll have to buy something better / stronger. 2.  Read reviews, this one got me, lesson learned. 3.  I would have paid more for a metal one.	-1
Medline customer support advises me that the product is not sterile, and intended for use only on scrapes and minor wounds. Customer service advises that it is not suitable for use on serious or surgical wounds. Thus to label the bottle label "Wounded Cleanser" is false and misleading.	-1
After using this product for a while now, I've realized several things why I won't be buying this product again.  First, I noticed that if I sprayed this solution directly at the silicone bead and smooth with my finger there will be "flashing".  The edges of the caulk line has problems sticking to the surfaces you're trying to seal.  At first I had thought I used too much but even spraying sparingly will result in flashing.  I ended up covering it over with another line but used water instead to smooth the caulk.  This time I get nice feathered edges with good seal.  After several more tries, I realized the only good compromise was to wet my finger with this stuff and try to smooth a silicone line.  This seems to give a decent result.  For what it's worth, this is an ok product but has a lot of nuissances that I found not worth buying again.  I'll pass...	-1
Pretty good!	-1
Ear pieces so uncomfortable they are actually painful. Does not feel very durable... Flimsy even.	-1
unable to use. I strongly suggested "do not buy unless you know what you are buying"	-1
This works, but it's extremely gooey. If you recoat your pads, you need to let it air dry for a while before attaching.	-1
I regret buying this! The only thing it's good for is a mean practical joke. I got this to extend the life of my TENS unit pads. I grudgingly give the product one star because it did stick to my skin and it did conduct the current. But......I am heartily sorry I used it. It ruined a large pad I use on my lower back. I just wanted to increase the adhesion. This stuff stays permanently gummy and the patch slides on the skin, leaving goo behind. When you touch it, strings pull up and spread the mess. It cannot simply be wiped off with a dry paper towel. When you wet it, it takes on the consistency of slug slime. It must be scrubbed with hot soapy water over and over. Then, you get white, water-logged boogers. Plus, you still have a sticky residue left behind. I gave up because my skin was sore. It also seemed to conduct the current irregularly. In some parts of the pad, the current felt like a sharp pinprick!	-1
Worked as expected. Recieved in time as posted. Product is of good quality.	-1
Tried to revive and old conductor pad I had and it just didn't work for me.  I wouldn't buy this product again.	-1
This item was bought to promote a contact between the skin and a heart rate watch from SwimOutlet who advertised that a good contact was necessary. Tried the watch with and without the contact gel. Neither worked. I doubt it was the fault of the gel. I thought it was the fault of the watch, and sent it back and received a credit. I wanted a heart rate meter because I was under great workload in physical therapy.	-1
SUPER GARBAGE.  I'm not expecting a Littman or professional quality stethoscope, by the way.  I have significant medical experience, and actually one steth. I use is actually really cheap, but it works well.  I'm getting these for students of a class.... but when I tried to use one, it was HORRIBLE.  Very muffled heart sounds -- don't waste your time & money.  Furthermore, this company is now asking me to PAY FOR SHIPPING ($10.18)-- even though when I bought them it was with "free shipping."  This is in ADDITION TO THE 15% RESTOCKING FEE.  How they can retroactively ask for shipping is beyond me.  Whoever runs this company, I hate them!  I'm contacting amazon, and I'll update this review as to the conclusion.  In the mean time, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!	-1
The nails aren't the lengths listed, and the (very small) package doesn't separate the various sizes. The stripes of nails easily break and become unusable. Better packaging is definitely needed. I'll buy individual boxes by size from now on.	-1
Can not choose color, so you get the one you don't want.  Also, rubber o-ring on these go bad, when you replace battery's you can't get the cover back on. I took the seal off but then water leaked in and rusted on the battery terminals (and batteries).	-1
Terrible. Wasn't even able to close the box using high end rg6 cable. If the cable is high quality the fitting will be too big to shut.	-1
Vulkem brand not sold at local big box store.  I used this to seal around my vinyl window after initial installer's silicone caulk peeled.  I got a fresh tube and the sealant flowed out easily.  I used a battery powered caulk gun so I can't tell how much pressure is needed if using a manual caulk gun.  I know the label recommended using soapy water to smooth out the sealant but I used WD40 instead and it came out smooth.  Only time will tell if this holds up.  Update (1/2017):  During a rainy spell, window frame started leaking inside at the top of both ends.  Went out to look and this sealant had shrunk and peeled off the window at both ends.  This was caulked no less than a year ago.  I guess I'll go back to using 100% Silicone for windows from now on.  The time, expense and incurring water damage from using this product is very disappointing to say the least.  Not recommended for windows or any smooth surfaces due to adhesion problems!	-1
Not a great teaching tool. It's a little tricky getting it to rest on the stand.	-1
Everything I read stated the latex caulk was user friendly. Not so. No matter how hard I squeezed the caulk would not flow. It came out in globs. I even stuck a paper clip in the hole to ensure there was not any blockage. I had to throw it away. More wasted money.	-1
Should have read all the reviews before I purchased this product. Just like the others  the ph tester arrived with No fluid in the cap, dried  up foam  was stuck to the electrode!!! they also did not give enough storage solution to add to the cap, which left me with only the ph buffer solutions to store , it has been giving fluctuate  readings not accurate  readings  beware	-1
[...]  The above shopping cart is from Kmart and its rocks. First I bought this and it was awful... not good enough.  Then I got the one in the link and WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't make the same mistake as me!  I do NOT work for KMART or the company that makes this cart!  HONEST!	-1
Junk- Hard Brittle plastic tape that don't stick .  You wrap it around a wire and the end doesn't stick- it peels off.  Junk	-1
I am not a fan of the screws that I got.  I pre-drilled my holes in a fiberglass boat - not the thickest or strongest of materials out there.  Using a hand-driver, I still had a few screws bend on me while cutting the threads in the holes, and I had 2 snap on me inside the fiberglass, forcing me to re-drill all the holes and wind up with extra holes in the boat - not a good thing.  I wasn't cranking down on the screws with monster truck force, and they gave no warning of binding or failing - just snapped clean off.  I'm less than thrilled with these screws.  For what it's worth, I got the #4 screws, so maybe the larger diameter options are better?	-1
If you're looking for something to wander around your tile floor and pick up dirt, and you don't have very many obstacles in the room, and you don't mind the sound of a shrieking robot, get this item!  If you have carpets or furniture or sleep when it's running, go elsewhere.  Edit:  It's a month later and this thing died.  Now I have a dead shrieking robot.  Which is only good for when my ex-wife comes over.  Seriously, screw her.	-1
The worst tape I have ever bought.  This is NOT duct tape.  It is just thin palstic tape with no cloth backing.  Scotch should relable this as "The Cheap Stuff, Not Duct Tape".  Look elsewhere for duct tape.	-1
I was really disappointed in this tape. I expected better from Scotch. It is thin and it does not stick well. I will not buy this again.	-1
Not brown like the photo. It states brown on the label and looks brown in the item photo, but is actually gold.  No where near brown.	-1
Inaccurate temperatures; is always 2 to 5 degrees off. Also skips numbers, i.e., 75, 76 and 78 degrees always reads 77. This is one weird piece of crap. DO NOT purchase.	-1
The unit I received was not accurate. I tested it and compared it to my thermostat in my house  along with other thermostats I have. I also compared it to another unit I bought here that has a wireless receiver. And tested against my local weather station reports. This unit was 20% off on the humidity and 10-15 off on the temp.	-1
I had wondered why my very expensive sapplings were dying since I was monitoring them so closely.  After reading reviews about this montor, I checked the digital readout for temperature against that of several very dependable thermometers and this instrument reads 5 DEGREES TOO LOW!  I was cooking my sapplings because I thought the temperature was low enough to keep them out of the risk of harm.  I do not know about the hygrometer; but, if the reading were important to me, I would also check it against other reliable sources.  These reviews helped me find the deadly link in my plant growing setup.  The temperature gauge was very inaccurate!	-1
Works great but it keep resetting it's self so I'm not able to keep a close eye on the highs and lows ... it won't keep the recorded high or low for more then few hours	-1
worked fine for about a month, but hasn't kept accurate temp for at least a week. now some portions of digits not displaying. and reading 10F indoors. actual temp is about 70F. tried new batteries. same exact result. can't return after 30 days - i tried. also, the INCREDIBLY SMALL DISPLAY on this thing isn't much larger than a book of matches. definitely wouldn't buy again. i tend to like Amazon recommendations, but ended up with a real dud, this time.	-1
Humidity level off by 11% showing less than actual humidity. Only visible during day time with strong light shining on it from right angle.	-1
I have a black/silver unit and a black unit. The black/silver one works better...tracks my thermostat temperature and humidity readings more closely, and gives meaningful high and low values. The black unit's high and low values are supposed to cover the last 24 hours, but they actually cover a shorter period. The black unit occasionally shows 1% humidity, and it's dry in here, but not that dry. The white unit looks identical to the black one, other than color, so it presumably works the same. The black unit and white unit have a more logical display arrangement, so it's too bad that they don't work as well as the black/silver unit (older model?).	-1
I don't know why it would say 45% humidity is low and 29% humidity is ok this don't seem very accurate to me.	-1
it diding not work.	-1
Doesn't work very well humidity doesn't seem to change and the temperature doesn't change at all	-1
Not accurate in both temperature and humidity reading when compared to furnace/thermostat and humidifier settings.  Product also not eligible for return.	-1
Useless for humidity. Humidity was consistently 10% off versus 2 other humidity gauges I have.	-1
I purchased this because if was supposed to remove graffiti from concrete. We had a eight foot section of a concrete retaining wall spray painted with red paint by some hoodlums. I followed the instructions precisely. Then I tried a second and third application. I was not able to get one piece of the graffiti removed. It is imbedded in the concrete. Has been on about three weeks. I wanted this to work but looks like it is not going to happen. Cannot recommend for concrete. Perhaps it would have worked on some other surface, at least the reviews say it will.	-1
Reads 77 degrees all the time, tried taking out the batteries to reset it a few times and still 77 degrees. Past the return period so I guess I'll use it for a paper weight.	-1
Wanted another digital thermometer /hygrometer for another room & foolishly went with this acu-rite junk when I should've bought same 1 I had. Temp off by a good # of degrees & humidity way off.   I have a no frills, inexpensive basic as it gets 1 that says Thermo meter on bottom & it's insanely accurate.  Fast reads too. Then this acu-wrong junk & another crap brand that reads 19% humidity all the time, except in excessive humidity which will read around 21%. Wrong! Both r fancier than my perfect basic 1 but useless.  I'll take my boring looking, super accurate 1 all day over these junkers.	-1
I have had this now for a year and it is inaccurate by 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  I have set the a/c in the house to 78 and it shows 73.  I have also tested the area this sits with an infrared thermometer and that shows the temperature to be 77.8.  I even changed the battery.  Who knows how accurate the humidity sensor is.  Not sure how this has so many good reviews.	-1
I bought this a few months ago, and already doesn't work. The seller, Chaney Instruments, should refund my money. I never dropped it or mishandled it. It is only 2 months hold, yet it doesn't work any longer. The numbers on it or all distorted. Even when it did work, it didn't make sense. It would show my lowest temperature recorded inside my place at 72 degrees F, yet when looking at my current temp, it showed 68. Go figure.	-1
I've had one for about a year.  Trusted it completely.  Liked it so much - especially the 24 hour hi/low function, I bought 3 more for my new greenhouse.  Can't trust any of them.  You be the judge - see the photos.	-1
worked for less than a month before it just stopped working.	-1
I love the slots for holding the bag in place. Nice purchase; just wish the lid for this didn't cost more than the can (from most sellers), itself. two stars removed for that "bait and switch" type marketing disgrace.	-1
I found the temperature measurements for this unit to be way off in the short-term, compared against 3 other extremely accurate units. I expected this thing to update fairly quickly, but in hindsight this unit is better for reading the average temperature and humidity of a room over the course of a day, rather than obtaining a new temperature measurement within minutes. Would not recommend for use with an indoor garden.	-1
Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.	-1
I've had this unit less than a mount and it's dead. The screen has died and is so dim that it's unreadable and it's ineligible for a refund/return. Avoid this, spend a little more and get something quality.	-1
Stopped working after 10 months. No joy getting it fixed or replaced.	-1
Just arrived today. Put 2 different batteries in it and didn't work. Great that Amazon was able to refund me but I wanted a working item. Poor quality control on manufacturer.	-1
I have many of these cheap hygrometers (different models and brands) and none of them are anywhere near accurate with RH or even temp. You get what you pay for.	-1
Arrived non-functional. After inserting the battery the screen lit up and it displayed 14 degrees F and 16% humidity. I thought it just needed to calibrate or something along those lines well after sitting for several minutes it refused to read anything other than 14/16. The only button on the device is to switch from F to C and all that did was display the same wrong temp in C.	-1
The battery cover was jammed shut. The fragile supporting hinge for the monitor stay came off in the effort to open the battery cover. The display appears to be good otherwise.	-1
It stopped displaying clearly after one month. I have had good luck with AcuRite up to now so I purchased another. Time will tell.	-1
Lasted less than a month before display failed (became garbled). Tried new battery.	-1
Not accurate, varies between 3-4% off, and not returnable through Amazon. Bought for a guitar case to keep guitar within acceptable humidity range, and this is also too big for case. The ThermoPro TP50 is more accurate, $4 cheaper, and smaller.	-1
As other reviewers have noted, this thing is not accurate. Compared to other hygrometers, it gives very inaccurate readings. Cheap, disappointing, prolly made in China...	-1
Trash. Sprinkle a little water on these things and it'll stop working instantly. Had to buy three more just because of that issue. Needs to be water proof	-1
It worked great, for exactly 34 days.  Then the numbers started disappearing.  See photo.  Makes use impossible.  New battery did not help.  Frustrating, because I did like it.	-1
I have 2 side by side...and they are 2 degrees different always.	-1
the humidity is 6-8 5 off & temp. is 2 degrees off. & seller has not got back to me.	-1
These things are straight junk...  Bought 6 of them and almost  all broke within 2 months of buying them...  2 came with broken clips, I really don't care about that...  5 of the 6, the magnets' glue came off so the magnets won't stick to the device...  3 so far are showing partial numbers for the temp and humidity, making them unreadable and useless....	-1
I bought two of these to compare humidity in two apartments. I thought I would sit them together so I could callibrate any differences. See the photo for how they are right out of the box.  Probably just a case of one bad unit, but that doesn't help me today, when I was counting on using them. And, I don't even really know which one to send back, or if the one that's more likely right is close to actually being right.	-1
I bought two. They were both Way off in regards to humidity. With semi-calibrated equipment I knew the room was about 68% humidity, but both units read 40% & 41% respectively. I ordered these two units a week apart, so I doubt they were "next" to each other during assembly. Amazon DOES NOT honor returns unless you write them and ask really really nice. That was a first for me after ten years of being a prime member.	-1
New review after using it for over a year: It's not accurate. I have it right next to a more accurate and precise humidity monitor and this one is up to 6% off. Pay the extra few dollars and get one that does what it's supposed to.  Original review when I first got it: Very helpful and easy to set up and use. Clear, large, easy to read data give me exactly what I need. I like how it has the highs and lows for the last 48 hours too.	-1
5 degree off (lower) than actual temperature. Had to throw it into the trash can.	-1
It's nice but it seems to resolve temps by 2 degrees. Mine reads out only temp odd-numbered temps, so if it's 72 degrees, I won't know it. If you're going to buy a thermometer, it seems to me that a 1-degree resolution is not too much to ask.	-1
I have been using four of these units in my basement for the past three months.  Last night I decided to check them for consistency.  I place all four next to each other.  After 15 minutes, all four units had different humidity readings.  I left them together over night; this morning, they are all different again.  CRAZY different, ranging from 63% to 72%.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!	-1
it's very unresponsive to changes in temperature or humidity. I'm beginning to question its overall accuracy.  Good to use to get an idea of the temperature or humidity of somewhere if you let it sit for a couple hours to equalize, but not useful for short-term purposes like testing out an AC system in a small room.	-1
I have ordered these twice about a year apart.  In total I purchased 6 units.  5 of them read within a % of each other.  One is way off...by 10 to 15%.  Although I would have liked all 6 to be matched this is not bad for such an inexpensive device.  I use mine to check my photographic equipment humidity box and to check the levels in the house.  Good product.  Have not bothered to contact Amazon or the vendor about the one bad unit.  Perhaps I will....perhaps too much trouble.  I am pleased with the product.  BTW two of my units (both read accurate) have been running over a year on the battery....so I think this is low battery consumption.  Very pleased.  UPDATE 5/27/16 I lowered my rating to two stars.  This review is not only the product but on Amazon.  Yes Amazon ..I have been a PRIME member for several years and make many many purchases.  I decided to return the one bad unit and the online information states I have till June 2 to initiate a return.  But when I go through the return process it states the item is not eligible for return and provides me a link to the return policy.  Of course I can not find anything that is associated with this device.  So...the product is good if you can accept a failure rate of 1 in 6 and can accept a no-return policy.  I figure this is worth 2 stars.  Sorry Amazon....I still love your service but this time you did not come through.	-1
First off, I have TWO of these units, the first I'd purchased from Amazon, the second was a replacement sent free by Amazon when I requested a return on the first due to accuracy issues. I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.  To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.  The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.  FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.	-1
I give this a 1, only because it worked for 2/3 of a year woohoo, zero would be more appropriate.  This is junk. Spend your money on something better.	-1
Works great for a brief period then starts being completely wrong. You have to remove the battery to reset it and it will work for another short period. It will read 16 degrees in my house when it's obviously near 70 degrees.	-1
lasted a week	-1
Very inaccurate. Would not buy again.	-1
Plastic garbage. This product is only good for very light use. May be useful to model kit hobbyists to keep light and sensitive objects in place. Not for moderate use at all. It will not hold metal or wood in place. If you tighten it too much it will start to give and will damage the plastic grip. You get what you pay for.	-1
The ball joint that lets you use the vise at different angles isn't very secure. I found myself tapping on my project and having the whole ball joint move or the vise rotate which defeats the purpose of having the vise so I returned it.	-1
Every part of this loosens and flexes when minimal force is applied (~5 inch pounds).  I had one of these snap at about 25 inch pounds.  They tend to snap at the part that holds the ball pivot.	-1
Went to use this just today, there is a crack in the housing preventing it from being tightened enough to hold anything. Already have a replacement on the way. I'll update this review once I have the new vice and am able to use it.	-1
There is nothing 'right' about this device....the 5 stars , we'll...no idea what they are thinking.  Doesn't tighten properly  Heavily plastic  Ballpoint won't stay put  Rubber slides around out of place under any pressure  It is simply awful , do not buy this....please.	-1
This reads a different temperature and humidity than my thermostat when sitting right below it.	-1
Not the best of shape when it arrived as the corner was beat.	-1
Says that it is 12x12 inch but actually came 11.75x11.75 inch.  Unfortunately this is too small for what I needed and took 2 months for it to arrive.	-1
This sheet is undersize. Someone else mentioned this, too. Mine are 1/4" and 3/16" shy of being 12" square. Unfortunately I *do* need the full 12", so this isn't going to work well.  If people have a hard time with their cutting tolerances, they should make sure they err on the large side instead of shafting people.	-1
Undersized sheet, warped, wouldn't adhere to print bed. Waste of time & money.  I installed this curled PEI sheet using the recommended 3M 468MP adhesive sheet.  The first time I tried to use it, the bed started to preheat and the PEI warped back off the bed at the front and back edges when the adhesive warmed and the PEI returned to its curled shape.  I removed the bed and use a brayer to roll the PEI into the adhesive and did a test reheating.  It stuck a bit better for a few minutes then rolled off the bed again in the front and back.  It's completely unusable.  I never touched the PEI with my fingers to contaminate it.  I peeled the protective sheet and immediately applied the PEI to the adhesive.  I guess I'll buy Ultem sheets from an industrial supplier that I use, for about the same price and I'm likely to get FLAT sheets of Ultem so I can hopefully avoid this wasted time and effort.  I'll also get actual 12" sheets instead of these 11.8" sheets that are so small that my 6"X9" print bed can only get one sheet out of this supposedly 12"X12" sheet of PEI.	-1
As others have stated, the sheet I received was warped. Thinking that it would be fine once I glued it to the hotbed I was wrong. It caused the bed to warp so leveling was impossible. Others have reported that the received a flat sheet, but it like rolling the dice when you order. Look elsewhere..	-1
While this PEI surface on my printer bed is good for adhesion, I had serious problems getting this sheet to stick to either the aluminum bed or a glass plate even using 3M 468 adhesive.  The problem is that the sheet of PEI I received was warped about 1/2" over 12 inches length.  I did not think this was a problem and mounted it, then ended up stripping and remount it several times.  That small, permanent warp in this PEI sheet caused no end of problems with it lifting off the bed at the edges.  PEI is flexible but does not conform well and tension always existed at the edges.  A flat sheet from another supplier has not had this problem.  I'm testing to see if mounting it with the warp down will work any better, but frankly don't have much hope for it.  Perhaps what I got is an anomaly, but I've wasted a ton of time trying to get this particular product to work properly.	-1
These sheets should be as perfectly flat as possible to be used on a 3D printer bed.  The two I received are horribly curled like they were cut from the inside of a roll.  They are on their way back.  Will try another brand.	-1
This item is NOT 12" x 12". Actual size is 11 1/4" x 11 1/4". If you're looking for a 12 x 12 sheet for your 12x12 print bed, shop elsewhere.	-1
Dimensions are off. Makes a very expensive unusable piece of plastic.	-1
Update: After some extensive use and on my 2nd sheet of this Im changing this from 5star to 2star. Trying to print anything somewhat wide or long in area that also has a 1/2"+ in height will cause this sheet to rip up from the build plate (and your print from the sheet). While you *can* get some permanent 3m adhesive sheeting, that screws up your ability to shim the PEI which is required since none of these sheets are even remotely flat. I estimate variations +/- 1mm will leave you frustrated if any of your prints require precision. Theres no reason they cant make these sheets precise, the tech exists, this is just lazy manufacturing. Im going to look towards solid specialized buildplates since there is no way to have this adhere to the printbed AND be level.  ---old---- PEI works great with PETG, no heat necessary at ~75f. Its kinda hard to get up thin sheets but thicker prints you can pull right off. I used this on a robo 3d r1+ with double sided sticky tape as there is no room for clips and adhesive sheets appear to be a more permanent solution. This has allowed me to use the whole build area since heat is not needed.	-1
I purchased a sheet 1/8" thick and 12" x 24" long. This was to be cut for a bed for a 3D printer. I was very disappointed that the sheet was very warped, does not lie flat at all and impossible to correct the bowing in this. At the price I paid, which was over $100, I cannot recommend this material, if they are all warped like this.	-1
Nice, consistent 1/8" thickness, but the sheet is warped.  So much so that it bows the borosilicate glass on my 3D printer if I try to clamp it down.  Unfortunately, this piece is useless to me.	-1
Surprised to find that what I got was so lacking in tensile strength.  If I put the rod on end it will quickly bend in the middle and collapse on the floor. If you want a rigid rod this is not going to work for you at all.	-1
I thought it was just random bad luck that another reviewer got a dirty / scratched panel but mine arrived this morning and is going back this afternoon.  It was dirty with deep scratches and boot marks and some corners chipped. Totally unusable for my purposes.  Now, there is a slim possibility that everyone is getting the same panel that is being returned and then sent on to the next customer, but otherwise the factory is full of dirty panels with boot marks on them.	-1
All packed in one baggy. I like my stuff individually wrapped and sterile. I'd NEVER buy these again!!	-1
preasre buttons on all cans do not firmly attach.  not happy	-1
I cannot use this GUM flosser.  The floss just doesn't hold tightly, no matter how it's wound.  After flossing the first teeth, the floss is loose, then it must be rewound, and then it's loose.  I just can't get it to work.  I bought this for my children thinking it would make flossing easier.  They don't use it at all.  I will give it two stars, because at least I can use the floss straight out of it, but the flosser is useless for us.	-1
doesn't work. piece of crap.	-1
Don't know what to think of this device. It certainly does measure "something", not sure that it actually measures RF as it says. It has a scale for it but I did the cell phone test per the instructions and also checked my wireless router. Neither device showed any reading with the meter set on high sensitivity. It seems to pick up EMF just fine as it pegged on both the electrical meter and next to the microwave oven. We should all know by now that you don't stand close to anything with high current going through it so, is it worth $20 to verify this fact? eh....maybe.  I would like to see it register at least something from a transmitting cellphone so I know its working right? Kinda cool but seems like a toy for adults to me. Probably need to spend more to get a semi-pro level device.	-1
Is it just a coincidence that this item looks exactly like the item that is being sold as "Ghost Meter"? That one is useless for detecting EMF from a cell phone, and this one probably is just as useless.	-1
Junk. Literally have to be on signal generator to set it off.  Junk build.	-1
